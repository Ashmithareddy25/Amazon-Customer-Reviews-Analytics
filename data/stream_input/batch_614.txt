B0000DIXDR|5.0|I have one hand on the bible, one hand in the air, and I confess that I indeed used to be obsessed with this movie, as most women my age were. I had the soundtrack, I knew every line, I knew the choreography every dance step and swivel and thrust. Jennifer Grey was me, big nose, bad perm and small chest. Patrick Swayze, well he didn't exist in my world, so I had to watch his again and again. We all knew the \\"I carried a watermelon\\" and \\"nobody puts baby in the corner\\" but did we really know why we even felt so passionate about it in the first place? The story being set in the late 50's, the setting at a family vacation spot, the outsider looking in, dancing, forbidden love, mystery, it all entered our psyches as THE perfect movie and never lost its footing. Could Patrick Swayzes white t-shirt be any tighter, could Jennifer Grays smirk be any cuter, could Jerry Orbach be a more perfect protective father?  NO! After this came out, I saw advertisements for learning how to \\"dirty dance\\" and asked my parents, with me being in ballet and jazz, what was one more class? Well it turns out 14 year olds shouldn't be gyrating against each other, who knew? I still learned them, by watching the tape over and over, but my partner was a girl named April and I think we giggled too much. Now that I think about it, if anyone had caught us I would have been straight to therapy. I haven't watched it in years, my husband refuses to even acknowledge its existence \\"chick movie\\" he mumbles, is it really just a girl phenomena? Well, no matter, It's a perfect specimen of Fun, laughs, thrills, tears and friction!!
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Funnily enough, the one film people say is the best videogame adaptation is Mortal Kombat, directed by much-maligned(but not really by me) director Paul W.S Anderson, with the Resident Evil ones at least being \\"decent\\". The Tomb Raiders, Doom, and so on were just absolutely horrible. Well Christophe Gans, the one behind the Brotherhood of the Wolf, probably gives us the next best adaptation but ultimately fails in the same area the others have. <br /> <br />Chris and Rose are dealing with the fact that their daughter Sharon sleepwalks. In her dazes, she mentions a place called Silent Hill, an old town in West Virginia. Wanting to get answers, Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill. However, they find very disturbing and strange things that do more than bump in the night, and a cult of religious fanatics who are, for lack of a better phrase, hellbent on ridding the town of evil. <br /> <br />Since it is a videogame adaptation, certain things in the story such as explanations are sacrificed for character and creep-out scenes. For example, besides a nasty looking janitor, what are the other creatures and how did they become to be that way? We have nurses, armless men, and soon-to-be everyone's favorite, Pyramid Head. Then there's just weirdness such as why would Chris and Rose live next to a cliff if Sharon sleepwalks? And why do the air-raid siren scenes happen at certain times then disappear.  <br /> <br />Then there's the banality in some of the dialogue. Characters come across a room that is visibly burned. \\"This looks like there was a fire here\\" says one of them. Ashes fall and leave a mark on a character's finger: \\"ashes\\" she says. Well gee, obviously! There was a bit too much references to the game that seemed kinda odd. A character finds clues or \\"puzzle pieces\\" let's say, which for some reason I started to say \\"you found the flashlight. Will you take the flashlight? You took the flashlight.\\" There's even platform jumping and I thought \\"wrong genre guys\\". <br /> <br/>The film does however succeed on its atmosphere and sound design. Unlike Resident Evil, which went from a dark horror game to a well-lit combat movie, Silent Hill maintains the look and feel of the games which you haven't seen a lot in these adaptations. Then there's the sound design and music which perfectly matches what the games had, with weird atonal ambience mixed with light melancholy piano. While it's one of the few times a film matched its source material, the story still feels off like the others had. <br /> <br />I think we can expect a double-dip soon. There's no commentary and we only have 6 featurettes which run roughly 10 minutes each. Not to mention there's behind the scenes stuff that you never saw in the movie such as the character's run-in with another armless men before going to a hotel. If you absolutely want Silent Hill then buy it but if you're one of those extras freaks like I am, then wait around a bit. <br /> <br />It's not really a film for everyone. Best way to describe it is that if Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat and maybe the first Tomb Raider were at least passable to you then check this film out. But since this is better than something like Doom, Wing Commander or Super Mario Bros, you should also try it.
1594200823|4.0|I cannot even begin to explain how powerful an effect this book has had on how I think and feel about how I have spent my life eating and living.  I did previously read a number of book of a similar vein (Fast Food Nation, The Crazymakers, Eat Here, The Obesity Myth, Is Our Food Safe?), but this one really brought home the complexity and extent to which agribusiness has invaded our everyday lives...by controlling what we eat...or rather what the foods we eat are made out of.  I had thought about what I eat and how I eat many times before and in giving up fast food and soda and changing out margarine for butter (yes, I really did finally do it...we don't eat margarine any longer) and I thought I'd come a long way in my \\"battle\\" against sugar, caffeine, ect.  As it turns out, the \\"problem\\" is a lot more pervasive than what I initially believed it to be and what was wrong with my fast food meal, is pretty much wrong with everything else I can pick up at my local grocery store...even the meat.  It's not being clich&eacute; or trite when I say after reading this book, I will never look at food the same way again...because I really am looking at the food I eat differently and while I can by no means toss out the contents of my pantry or refrigerator (which I'd really love to do), I CAN begin making a series of changes...but these changes come at a high cost (both monetary and emotional)...food grown more sustainably and not built on corn is more expensive in terms of money and then there is the convincing of my family to eat it.  Also up for consideration is the time spent researching and tracking down foods that actually are grown/raised in a way that is natural and healthy for the environment in general, for the food itself and for the people eating it, but this book makes me want to do just that (and I'm a fat, lazy 35 year old, so that says something)!!<br /><br />Pollan's book is divided into three sections, each ending with a meal eaten based on how the food from that particular chapter was grown.  Section one was all about the corn and soybean agribusiness.  I knew McDonald's food was bad for you, but really, even after reading Fast Food Nation I had no idea that so much of what we can get to eat from a fast food joint is made from corn...it's in practically everything!  This section, for me, was some of the most disturbing information I've read yet about fast food and the \\"corn industry.\\"<br /><br />In the second section, I was even more amazed about what I didn't know about how animals are kept, I had an inkling (I don't live in a cave or under a rock...heh), but this was plainly and succinctly explained and what I read was chilling.  I can't say that I'll ever look at a steak or chicken at the grocery store the same way again.  For the second section Pollan even shoots down the eating of organic foods from places like the Wholefoods Market chain...from the perspective of this book, this is nearly as pointless and \\"costly\\" to the environment as traditional agribusiness and large scale animal farms.  Reading this section was also a real eye-opener for me.  I particularly enjoyed the section about Polyface Farm, as it shows how a small scale sustainable farm CAN make it all work without chemicals, pesticides, and hormones/antibiotics!<br /><br />The final section focuses on hunting and gathering a totally locally produced meal and I was rather unhappy with the amount of time Pollan spent enmeshed in inner turmoil regarding hunting and how evil it is or isn't.  Since I grew up with a father who hunted...this was a bit much for me...you either hunt or you don't and a lot of people cannot stomach killing something with their own hands, \\"dressing it\\" and taking it home to eat.  This section, for me, was reminiscent of Coming Home to Eat by Gary Paul Nabhan (which I thoroughly enjoyed and also highly recommend), but with more whining about how hunting makes the author feel.<br /><br />Simply put, this is one of the most powerful books I've ever read about what is wrong with how we eat and I highly recommend it...it's not an easy read, it's over 400 pages and a bit dry too...but it's worth wading though it, you'll come out of it a changed person.  That's not to say the book is without errors, for it does have its share of small ones, but these are easy enough to pick out and move forward from, the overall message is what is important here.  For me, this cinched how I was already feeling and pushed me even further down the path.  I must admit, Pollan's ending left much to be desired...he basically says the problem is not solvable, but it is, just not in a way that is easy or that \\"big business\\" would be very happy with.  The \\"solution\\" is to move away from agribusiness and back to more local food communities, each of needs to begin to take a part in these \\"local food community.\\"  We need to become more aware of where our food is coming from and to make those tough choices regarding seasonal eating and pasture fed animals and even in the return to growing some of our own food at home - I look around everyday and see these huge manicured lawns and no gardens.  I suspect this conclusion was not made by the author directly because people don't want to hear it.  It could be said this is inferred or a logical conclusion based on what the author wrote, but it's not directly SAID anywhere in the book, I suspect that this is because it would be very unpopular...people are already too busy and for \\"us,\\" as a people, to go back to smaller scale farms and locally grown and raised foods, it would mean a BIG change in how we live, changes most people aren't willing to make or simply cannot make given how many hours they work.  I personally think it's far past time for this to happen, but I believe that most people aren't there just yet.  Reading The Omnivore's Dilemma might help move people further along to realizing how screwed up our food economy is and THAT is a good thing in my book!  A+ and highly recommended, I'll definitely be buying a copy for my bookshelf (I got this one from the library)!powerful books I've ever read about what is wrong with how we eat and I highly recommend it...it's not an easy read, it's over 400 pages and a bit dry too...but it's worth wading though it, you'll come out of it a changed person.

185984054X|3.0|Yeah, it's an odd title. Does the author know the OTHER meaning of that title? Yeah, he does. It's intentional, and I knew this as soon as I read a few reviews on this book. Thus, I'm sure you can understand my procrastination in opening the cover, for fear that it would shatter my view of one of my heroes of the faith. <br /> <br />It did exactly what I feared it would do. Sort of. Well, maybe. I'm not sure. <br /> <br />The author, Christopher Hitchens, pulls no punches in trying to expose Mother Teresa as a fraudulent cult leader who hobnobbed with despots, dictators, and corrupt businesspeople to advance her cause. If you have been inspired by the work of Mother Teresa, this is not an easy book to read. It sure wasn't easy for me. I'll spare you all the details, but I will highlight some points the author makes. <br /> <br />I want to be sure that I am telling you all that I'm writing these in summary and not necessarily in agreement: <br /> <br />    * Mother Teresa had an inconsistent message in terms of social justice--The author convincingly lays out the argument that M.T. devoted her life to the poor of Calcutta, but also spent some serious P.R. time with some of the most ruthless dictators and corrupt businessmen of our day, lavishly praising them in spite of the oppression they caused. <br />    * Mother Teresa's ministry did more to hurt the poor than help them--The author cites instances and first hand accounts of doctors and nurses who made the pilgrimage to work in Mother Teresa's homes, only to find that many of the 'dying' could treated and saved from death, if Mother Teresa would allow for such treatment. <br />    * Mother Teresa accepted donations without concern for their source, but the money never made it to the poor. The questions the author poses: Does the end justify the means? ...and...Where did the money go? <br />    * Mother Teresa's strict policies on abortion and conraception--The author blatantly and bluntly disagrees with Mother Teresa's strict views on abortion and contraception (she feels both are equally wrong). Thus, in the mind of the author, the poor are enabled to remain poor by not having the sufficient means to control population. <br />    * In sum, the world has turned a blind eye to the fraud that is Mother Teresa. <br /> <br />It's hard to even type those words. I feel dirty doing it. The author certainly, without shame, has an anti Christian bias (maybe more correctly, an anti-Catholic bias), but he brings a convincing argument on some points. <br /> <br />I'm guessing that the truth is somewhere in the middle. Here are my thoughts: <br /> <br />    * Mother Teresa was not a development worker. Thus, we shouldn've expert her alone to alleviate poverty. Could she have lent her image and influence to development efforts int the third world? Sure. But remember: within her tribe of Catholicism, suffering and poverty are exalted in Mother Teresa's worldview, almost to a fault. We are called to suffer for the cause of Christ. Absolutely. And we are to give up all for Him. But the point of such sacrifice is not poverty for poverty's sake, but poverty for God's sake. This is the debate usally labelled: God's Preferential Option for the Poor, and itself deserves an entire blog to truly unravel all the complexities of the discussion. <br />    * Mother Teresa did a TON of good in the world. We may not like some of the company she kept in front of the cameras, but you can't ignore the fact that countless men, women, and orphans who were truly on their deathbed were given dignity in their last days by her ministry. Plus, she made poverty an issue that couldn't be ignored, regardless of one's view. <br />    * If nothing else, Mother Teresa inspired millions to, at the very least, consider the poor. Her rock star like fame brought attention to the plight of poor. Plus, she offerred a refreshing perspective: the health and wealth gospel simply doesn't hold water. If you are to err to one sideor the other, side with the poor. There you will encounter God. Not in your GPS navigated beamer. <br />    * If Mother Teresa can be blamed for anything, it's that she loved and trusted too much. I hope that maybe she was ignorant of the oppression caused by some of her donors. I hope that if she wasn't ignorant, she was at least so trusting and so loving that she saw the good in these idiots that the rest of us couldn't see. I hope that these swindlers and despots were transformed by God through their encounters with Mother Teresa in such a way that they reconsidered their selfish and destructive behavior. I hope... <br /> <br />The main lesson to be drawn from reading a book like this, regardless of one's view, is that nobody's perfect. Even Mother Teresa. <br /> <br />I don't accept the author's premise that Mother Teresa was concerned solely with power as she sought to establish her 'cult'. That's just too far fetched. Did she make some mistakes? Sure. Who hasn't? If my personal impact on the world was but a fraction of Mother Teresa's, then I would feel like my time, my energy, and my resources were worth it. <br /> <br />Much of the blame probably lies with the media and the political leaders, who quite frankly used and abused her image and her leagacy to advance their own causes. They set her up on a pedestal that no person deserves. Let this be a lesson to all of us.
B000021XR5|4.0|No. 4 (1999.), the Stone Temple Pilots' fourth studio album<br /><br />In the early 1990's, the Stone Temple Pilots were one of the dominant faces of rock music. The band's debut album, 1992's `Core' was a massive commerical success, with many tracks from the classic album getting loads of air-play. The band subsquently cemented this success (and defied their critics' `one album wonder' jibes) by releasing follow-ups in the almighty `Purple' and then with `Tiny Music...'. However, disruption was to hit the band in the second half of the 1990's, mostly due to Scott Weiland's increasing drug addiction, which would lead to a criminal sentence. As a result, the Stone Temple Pilots didn't so much split but took an extended recess from making music. Scott Weiland released a solo-album `Twelve Bar Blues' in 1998 and the rest of the band, under the name `Talk Show', an album a year earlier. However, with the lack of success both of these albums bought, it was clear that the winning formula was the complete Stone Temple Pilots. Thankfully, the great STP reunited and set about garnering material for a new album. `No. 4' was released right at the end of the millenium, at a time when grunge was long gone and mainstream musical tastes were far altered. How would STP's fourth outing fare?<br /><br />In many respects, the odds were well stacked against the Stone Temple Pliots at the end of the millenium. At the time, nu-metal acts were ruling the airwaves and the grunge bands of the early 1990's were either long gone (i.e. Soundgarden, Nirvana) or had become underground based (i.e. Pearl Jam). No-one would have expected STP to re-emerge and start mass selling records again. Well...how wrong could they have been, as `No. 4' proved to be another storming, diverse and powerful statement from the band and yes, it deservedly sold very well. The three year hiatus between `Tiny Music...' and `No. 4' had not caused any creative souring in the band and neither had the disruptions badly affected the band's chemistry. Just like on previous albums, STP re-invent themselves on `No. 4' and the results are great. Musically, the band draws on ideas from all 3 of their previous albums and blend them together for this album. As a result, we have another extremely diverse release from STP. The hard-hitting rock of `Core' is here with songs such as `Down' and `Heaven and Hot Rods', the rocking-quirkiness of `Purple' is here in songs such as `MC5' and `No Way Out' and the experimental styles of `Tiny Music...' are also here in songs such as `Sour Girl' and `Glide'. Literally, `No. 4' is one of those albums which can't disappoint and sounds fresh whilst maintaining that vintage STP sound. There are the odd criticisms I have with the album; chiefly, you wish it could be longer but then quantity doesn't always mean quality. Also, the cover is a little uninspired, as is the title. However, these are really just aesthetic things in context as the music is top draw on the album. Scott Weiland's vocals are very diverse throughout the album, `Down' features his classic style of delivery and then we have a slow crooning style on `Atlanta' and a Bono-esque vocal sound on `Pruno'. Overall it's great stuff and is testament to his ability as a vocalist. The DeLeo brothers and Eric Kretz are all in form on the album too, the guitarwork varying well in styles throughout.<br /><br />One of the radio staples of the album, `Down', gets `No. 4' underway. This is heavy, bonecrunching tune, the riff classic STP through and through. The stop-start verse works well and the chorus is infectious. Dean DeLeo plays a cool solo mid-wat through. `Heaven And Hot Rods' continues in a similar heavy vein. This ones faster and more upbeat with resounding Weiland vocals. The band capture some great mood changes here between the verse and chorus. `Pruno' is a more interesting track, with a laid back verse. Weiland's vocals sound actually reminiscent of Bono here, before the song switches gear intoa really high energy chorus. `Church On Tuesday' is mid-tempo rocker with plenty of driven bass and great rhythm work on the guitar. The punchy chorus works really well. Next-up is `Sour Girl'. Another well known STP staple, this is one of the finest tracks on this album. The song has a refreshing `60's feel to it with chilled out guitar work and a catchy running bass line. The groove is captivating here and Weiland's vocals are excellent. The chorus is especially retro. `No Way Out' is a strong follow-up. Musically in the depths (the guitar/bass is really tuned down on this song) and it creates murky but unusual and foreboding sound. Weiland's screams of `Away Now!' blend well into the mix.<br /><br />`Sex and Violence' fires out of the blocks from it's onset. This ones a little punkish sounding in the chorus but is full of energy and power. Lyrically not so subtle (reminiscent to `Sex Type Thing' from `Core') but Weiland delivers the words in a strong tone. `Glide' is a  more spaced out, relaxing song featuring smooth guitar work and interesting higher register Weiland vocals. The experimentalism continues with `I Got You', with again a `60's feel to it. Weiland's lyrics about drug dependancy are backed well by a rolling bass line and country-ish guitar work. There's a nice introduction of keyboard too. `MC5' picks up the pace again, with a great drum intro and racy guitar-play. Weiland's vocals have a very commanding feel on this one. `Atlanta' is a suberb, acoustic closer. Scott Weiland has sings in a much more crooning style for this one over some fluid guitar work. It finishes with a rather grand sounding chorus beforen the surprise entry of a bass marimba at the end.<br /><br />All in all, `No. 4' is more fantastic stuff from the Stone Temple Pilots. Many would have written the band off by the end of the `90's but they re-emerged with another diverse offering full of strong songwriting and no compromise. This album isn't quite at the level of the first two of the band's albums, `Core' and `Purple' but it's not far behind and I'll recommend it to any fan of 90's rock. `No. 4' is pleasantly surprising stuff and is another display of a great band on the top of their game.<br /><br />MY RATING: 8.5/10orus. `Church On Tuesday' is mid-tempo rocker with plenty of driven bass and great rhythm work on the guitar.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|The first thing that needs to be said about this movie is that it should be taken as a historical piece and not indicative of the life of many if not most nuns today.  Yes, there are still cloistered nuns that follow the strict rules of silence depicted here.  However, for example, the hospital nun who visited my mother as she was dying lived in her own apartment in town, didn't wear a habit, and seemed to me to be much more interested in the people she was serving than in following onerous rules of piety. <br /> <br />That said, 'The Nun's Story' certainly comes in among the 1000 best movie ever made.  It is a very powerful drama, with flawless performances by the main characters.  In most ways, it fairly accurately depicts the pre Vatican II Catholic Church.  Since Vatican II, a lot has changed, and this change is spotlighted by this film when comparing Sister Luke's life with that of most nuns today.   <br /> <br />In a lot of ways, Sister Luke's convent was similar to the Pharisees so vividly depicted in Scripture.  They were so concerned with following every letter of the Law that they failed to perceive and serve the real, everyday needs of the people.   They were so focused on serving God that they forgot that Jesus said that 'if you have done it to the least of these (people), you have done it to Me.'  This is not to suggest in any way that the sisters were not really sincere in their desire to serve God; indeed, their desire, and the sacrifices they willing made, needs to be admired.   <br /> <br />I think Sister Luke would have made it as a nun today.  Of course there are still rules and disciplines that need to be observed.  But, as Jesus told the Pharisees, if a cow is stuck in a pit on the Sabbath, you forget the rules about only resting on the Sabbath and help the distressed cow.  If Jesus thought that about a cow, how much more so can the 'rules' be broken to serve another human being in distress?   <br /> <br />It is purely this dichotomy that distressed Sister Luke so much that he eventually had to leave the convent.  She was there to serve the needs of people, hurting people, not to follow endless rules to the letter.  She complained that the Convent expected that a sister counseling a lady who, for example, really needed comforting as she was dying, had to forsake the patient at the tone of the bell tolling silence.  Sister Luke couldn't reconcile the emotional affliction of that woman with the perceived benefits of silent meditation. <br /> <br />The whole movie is full of conflicts like this.  At one point. Sister Luke, an outstanding science student was asked to fail an exam so as to not appear to be superior to another, less talented nun in the same course.  What the Mother Superior didn't seem to realize was that for Sister Luke to give a false, wrong answer on the final exam, would make her into a liar.  As one is watching this movie, they would do well to look for situations such as these and ask himself what God, through the lens of today's Catholic catechism, would expect her to do.  Protestants should ask themselves the same things through their doctrines. <br /> <br />Knowing that everyone in religious life in this movie was sincerely trying to serve God in their best way possible, one can see the makings of great drama.  The big question addressed by 'The Nun's Story' is which way is the right way?  Or, maybe, different people need different ways of serving God, so both are right?  Perhaps, like Sister Luke, you'll want to pray about it.  Watch this classic movie, then decide for yourself!
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I would have to say that I liked it just as much as the last one.  I would have liked to have seen more of the Lycan brother though...he didn't have enough play.  I also want to know more because the sex scene was very *slow* and that means its important...I think selene is pregnant with some sort of crazy hybrid...I also want to see what kind of new powers she has.  The movie had so much that I can't even think of it all at this moment...I loved it.
B0000025DT|5.0|Basically, ANWR is the best of ELO in my opinion. I think so because it's a balance between the early ELO that many fans love and then the more \\"commercial\\" ELO of later years that another faction of ELO fans love so much.  <br /> <br />Every song is a gem, nothing is filler and it's beautifully crafted by all involved. One of the best albums of the 70s in my opinion
B00007LTIA|5.0|The cd was sent just as promised. I'd order from this dealer again.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I think almost everybody is missing the point of the film. The movie certainly was technically well done, but what helped it the most was the story.  Not to excuse his behavior, but Kane tried to control everyone while trying to make them love him because he had no control when he lost his parents as a child.  The mysterious \\"rosebud\\" was the name of his sled which he repeated several times in the course of the film at times of stress. He also recalled his most happy time of life which probably occurred just prior to being sent away by his mother.  He was playing in the snow just before he was traumatized by being forced to go away with a total stranger. The scene depicted in the glass ball of a snow scene he obsessively fondled and the word \\"rosebud\\" were his last thoughts at death.  With a lifetime of adult memories as a powerful, wealthy man and the lost love of a beautiful woman, what did he think about at the moment of death?  I think it was his lost youth and family that \\"rosebud\\" represented.
020530902X|4.0|It came in handy, though. I still have my copy from college, and it should be a good resource if I ever decide to write something again. Lots of specific examples and not overloaded with the pretentious junk editors tend to put in. It gets right to the point!<br /><br />AND it doesn't weigh you down like big fat history or physics books.<br /><br />Still, I'll admit that I avoided using it at times when I stupidly and stubbornly believed that my style was superior - so I feel somewhat guilty when I see it sitting on my shelf, almost hidden between big books. Generally, I don't care for textbooks, but this is more of a guide. And if you throw it against the wall, it won't leave as big of a mark as a physics book.
1565115147|4.0|The whole book is trying to answer one question based on evolution of humans in various regions of the World throughout time. The author explains the growth of manking and nature through time in great mathematical and scientific language. I was amazed to the detail that the author was able to present in the book. He was able to disect the many regions of the World and explain the diverse growth of mankind in history. I found the chapter on agriculture and how it affected human growth throughout centuries to be the most facinating. The concept of high calorie availability affecting human growth was quite interesting. At the end of it all the author was able to determine that any human would have evolved the same way if they were at the same location as another. Which describes that nature will always take its course. I gave the audio cd a 4 out of 5 as I found the voice of the narator to be boring as it had no inflection which made the audio book feel like a biology class at times. If you are interested in history and human growth this is a great reference.  Enjoy the CD!
0792165020|5.0|And I believe him.<br /><br />I sympathized with Tom, as I suspect most viewers do, despite his sociopathic nature. I was only sad about one of his murder victims - Peter. Some of the others become so cocky, sickeningly uppity, that you can't wait for them to get off the screen.  You want Tom to win. He is the underdog, after all, and people get tired of seeing the same sort of people (i.e. Dickie) win over and over again, especially if they don't make much of an effort. And Dickie is a prime example of someone who doesn't have to work but gets everything handed to him, and he doesn't even seem grateful for it. Spoiled. You know the type.<br /><br />In a way, Tom reminds me of Vincent, Ethan Hawke's character from Gattaca. Both are very ambitious. Doing anything and everything to fit in with the \\"upper class/superior society,\\" desperately trying to cover their tracks, obsessed with getting all the details just right..because the consequences of being found out would be disastrous. Both are fascinating characters but Tom is the one that intrigues me the most. He's so cold with that sick, sly smile on his face - you can't help but wonder what he's plotting, what twisted images he's conjured up.<br /><br />But Tom was a jealous, mad murderer, and Vincent was acting more out of revenge for society's prejudices against the genetically inferior.  One could say that Tom was acting out of revenge as well...revenge for having been born poor when he would rather be of the idle rich class, taking advantage of the best things in life. His self-esteem is so low that he has to pretend to be a dead person in order to feel fulfilled - and I don't think he'll ever be completely fulfilled. He'll always be looking over his shoulder, and a rich identity will not cure unhappiness and the void inside.<br /><br />Italy was a beautiful setting for this movie, adding more culture and depth than many other places, I think. That particular aura of all things foreign helped set the mood to something alluring and dark..<br /><br />Matt Damon's best film.od to something alluring and dark.. <br /> <br />Matt Damon's best film.
B00005JOQS|3.0|thats right!i said it!sure the real estate scam thing on the old one was corny but its better than a long,drawn out plot that only really gets cool right at the end.if they couldnt come up with a cool plot than they shouldve re-christened tim burtons  throw away project where he fights doomsday.all im saying is it didnt really fit into any one catagory too well because it lacked in so many areas.i mean ,ffs,dont pay actual money to watch it.i liked it least of any super hero movies ever made including  elektra,tv movies and all the bat-mans.i mean unless youre in live with superman,just skip it.
0452270073|3.0|Regeneration was an insightful book, but it did not completely captivate me. In it, a man (Siegfried Sassoon) is sent to a psychiatric hospital for soldiers in WWI, only because he had realized that the war he was fighting is essentially useless, that the reason for the war has disappeared, and that the people dying there, are not dying for a real cause. Dr. Rivers treats the patients at the hospital and he meets with Sassoon and it is his job to prepare  him to be sent back to war.  At the hospital the reader sees the other soldiers wounded physically and mentally from the war and the reader and Dr. Rivers begin to wonder if maybe Sassoon is right. Though the book was not my personal favorite it did make me think about how justifiable war is.
B00005JOVH|5.0|ok 1st let me thank the makers of this flick for adding in some of the unused mutants i mentioned  in my earlier reviews on x-men 1 and 2.there are still a  number of them left out but they did use some cool ones like the sentinal,dark phoenix,juggernaut and angel,the beast and collossus.there are still a long list of unused mutants however.mostly from the future or simply overlooked.they dont have to stop just because there are 3 parts.theres the whole story about which x-man would betray them in the furure.id also like to mention killspree and halloween jack.both awesome characters.this movie is what the  1st 2 have been leading up to.a breakdown in the system and an all out war between mutants and bad mutants and the humans.like a 3 way dance.the visual effects are awesome!its my favorite of the 3.any true x-men fan knows the story is way longer.i could see at least 2 more great movies in the set.the one i mentioned above and the one where magneto rips out wolverines admantium skeleton.there are a lot of old faces too like pyro,ice man,wolverine,rogue,jean grey and magneto .its a great movie and you should own it.

B00005JNRY|4.0|this movie was really cool.its not just about a few cars going left a lot in circles.first,theres a 3 way tie at the winston cup[nascars world series].this never happened before although kurt busch did finish 1st and jimmie johnson was 8 points behind 2 years ago.theres a lot of nasbar related stuff in there.1-only like 2 actual #s ftom a real nextel cup car are used.2-one of the cars on a 3 way tie is called the king.thays richard pettys old nickname.and the car was a old dodge superbird like the one ol king used to drive once.then theres a green and white car thats really aggressive.thats obviously dale earnhardt with a different paint job.then theres lightning mcqueen.hes the cool break out rookie who gas a chance to break a record by being the 1st rookie to be champ.anyhow,those 3 must race in a 3 car only race off at the end of the movie.any nascar fan i think will really enjoy it.it isnt just tossed together.someone actualy took time to research racesars.there the bump and run ,drafting,the skingshot and also as an asses bonus the racecars do famous things from nascar history like the pass in the grass and winning a race backwards.i think in all movies for children only toy story 1 and 2 are better.there are 2 poinrs i didnt like.1-mcqueen isnt a very cool name for a manly racecar hotshot rookie.unless of course you mean lightning is like jeff gordon then it all makes sense.2-the other thing i didnt like was the outcome of the big race  at the end.of course i cant say who won but they were booed and  had stuff thrown at them.thats just not a good thing to teach kids eveb if they font know that car was patterned after the greatest racecar driver ever.
B000GIXLO8|1.0|Let me accept the fact that LOTR is my most beloved film and I already own the extended editions of the films in one set! I'm really not surprised to see New Line coming up with another edition of the trilogy. With films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can!! Still, inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped Costa Botes documentaries, my advise to anyone buying LOTR for the first time is- DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 DTS EX glory, alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest of your life watching!! <br /> <br />Please be aware, these new editions DO NOT contain DTS tracks, no commentary tracks by the director, Weta workshop or the cast. All you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc...AND NOTHING ELSE. It would have been a better idea had New Line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again....And even this is not the end, once the HD format gains a little more acceptance, they'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy! <br /> <br />Beware, Extended edition set is the ultimate LOTR experience, in terms of films or bonus features. Go get it...Its worth all the money spent!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is the greatest concert I have ever scene. I can only imagine being there for real. A MUST SEE!!!!! Gilmour is Pink Floyd!!!!!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|It took me so long to see this film, and I'm not sure why. How frustrating to think I've spent the last few years without it when it is so Beautiful, distinct, and layered!    Another of my favorite films is \\"The End of the Affair\\" so I really should have known to see anything and everything Ralph Fiennes has acted in, but it took Juliette Binoche to pull me in this time. As usual, she stands out for her ability to \\"not act\\" or at least not to leave even a trace of acting behind her as she moves. He, on the other hand has a sort of intensity that can be unnerving.    I truly loved the rhythm of this film, and that it didn't hurry the viewer along. Not that the love affairs didn't develop rapidly as they must in movies, but it didn't feel forced. Minghella didn't fill every moment with words.       I'm rather tired of the prudishness that some reviewers show when they can't get past sexuality in a serious film. What would life BE, and how can one truly tap into the obsessive nature of these characters without having made that journey?     The English Patient certainly does not trivialize sexual intimacy, nor does it lighten the gravity of sex itself. If anything, it drives home how serious a matter that connection can be. Surely nothing to be taken lightly.      So much of our modern culture creates unrealistic and stunted portrayals of romantic and sexual desires...based on people's bodies rather than a strong inner connection and Compatible Imagination.     Thank goodness for films like this one which give the viewer more credit. In watching it now, dozens of times, I keep finding new angles and subtleties...the way the desert becomes the bed sheets, for instance. Visually striking.    To me, this film is a classic.
B00005R5G9|3.0|I recommend this film as a light hearted adult comedy.  The fairytale edge helps to weave the magic  within the story and project the comedy of the riduculous situations the plot presents.  The story of a mannequin that can animate into life at times and leave trouble behind makes for an interesting tale!
156224003X|5.0|People - some of us are born with it and some of us nurture and grow it, imagine if you had the ability to do both?   Kenny Werner is the Tony Robbins for musicians.  This book is more of a spiritual guide to become the musician YOU think you are capable of becoming.  If you believe that the only thing stopping you from achieving success, is you, then you are ready for this book.  The accompanying CD is great to listen to for meditating.  I have discussed this book with many musicians and overall it is agreed that this book is easy to read, in fact easy to apply too!

B000002LVB|4.0|Okay, after hearing all this [...] about new albums by Paris Hilton, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Simpson, I did what I always do: Escaped into that happy little land known as Music Made Before I Was Born. To be more specific, I listened to Sweet Jane, by far VU's greatest song, for the billionth time. It never gets old. The same can be said about Loaded... well, most of it.<br />Every VU album has a cliche around it - VU & Nico is the one from left field, White Light/White Heat is the speed-fueled party, VU is the quiet morning after, and Loaded is the pop album, minus the sex, the drugs, the murder (kind of ironic when you think about how being \\"loaded\\" can refer to being drunk or having a loaded gun). And the group pulls it off, though sometimes it seems they're trying too hard (I Found a Reason, Cool It Down). But there's a lot to like about Loaded: Who Loves the Sun, the aforementioned Sweet Jane, ode to Man's Greatest Invention Rock and Roll - like Ginny and Lou Reed, my life was also saved by rock 'n' roll. Not to mention album-closer Oh! Sweet Nuthin', New Age, Head Held High and Train 'Round the Bend. Loaded isn't perfect - subtract Lonesome Cowboy Bill, I Found a Reason, and Cool It Down, then we'll talk - but it's a good one!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Just finished a 6-day orgy of season 2 VM episodes on DVD. It's not only clever, and well written, it is littered with so many obscure pop culture references, you'll need it on DVD to rewatch. Like listening to a Public Enemy album and trying to identify all the samples. (Wallace's obsession with cake is a nod to Twin Peaks, for sure). It's a great series to discover on DVD because you can get the instant gratification of going from a cliff hanger right into the next episode (and no commercials!) Our record was six episodes in one night. Perfectly written and perfectly cast. Why do people watch crap like \\"2 1/2 Men\\" when there is brilliance like this on TV?? <br /> <br /> <br />The Season 2 DVD set has much better extras than Season 1. Some of the deleted scenes help tell the story and Kristen Bell's behind the scenes video is a blast. Just shut up and join the legion of addicts.
0452270073|4.0|I began this book thinking it would be exactly like other books I had read about World War I.  I thought it would be like \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" complete with gore, death, and tragedy.  However, \\"Regeneration\\" turned out to be more about the tragic effects of the war rather than the brutal warfare.  This was a new perspective for me.  Pat Barker's characters questioned the war and its aims.  The novel begins with Siegfried Sassoon's declaration opposing the war, questioning the figures of authority, and advocating a peace negotiation.  Yet, as the novel continues, the reader sees how conflicted the characters really are.  While two of the main characters, Sassoon and his doctor Rivers, constantly see what the war has done to the British youth, they also feel the need to be present at the front so they can protect the other soldiers.  It is a complicated feeling that is never completely resolved.  Barker makes a connection to a caterpillar's metamorphosis to a butterfly.  If one were to cut open the cocoon, one would not see a creature that was half butterfly and half caterpillar.  Instead, the caterpillar would be in a state of decay.  The views of the characters decay and discretely develop as the novel progresses.  Through seeing the effects of the war, the characters begin to develop new opinions of the war and its direction.   <br />Simultaneously, Barker incorporates authentic poetry written by the soldiers to display the different ways the war affected the different characters.  Both Sassoon and Owen, another patient at the hospital, write of the war.  Sassoon writes of the brutalities and realities while Owen writes of the utter hopelessness.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It provided new insight for me into the World War I British society.

B00008DDSC|3.0|In the tradition of Boogie Nights, Secretary takes the taboo and wraps it in a typical romance format.  Boogie Nights told a coming of age family story that happened to involve porn; Secretary tells a romance that happens to involve sadomasochism.<br /><br />Our heroine is the vulnerable Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal, sister to brother Jake of Donnie Darko fame).  Gyllenhaal has a waifish, almost unearthly look about her that radiates a sad vulnerability, which makes her perfect for the role.  As Lee, she players a character filled with self-loathing, hating herself so much that she not-so-secretly cuts her thigh with a razorblade.  When her parents eventually discover her destructive habits, they commit her to a mental institution.  Lee is eventually released, but she will never truly get \\"better.\\"<br /><br />As an important first step in escaping her restrictive home life, Lee gets a job as a secretary.  She works for the intimidating Mr. Grey (James Spader), who brooks no failure.  Working for the handsome boss turns out to be a challenge Lee enjoys, in more ways than one.<br /><br />Once Mr. Grey discovers that Lee is a masochist, he takes slowl but subtle control of her world. Grey alternately sets Lee free and dominates her by telling her she will never cut herself again.  And Lee complies, throwing away her box of sewing equipment that she used to mutilate herself.<br /><br />But Lee's release is also a taste of the forbidden that she craves.  Eventually, Mr. Grey resorts to spanking as a form of discipline, a torture she enjoys.  Thus begins the S&M relationship between boss and secretary.<br /><br />Although they don't sleep with each other, the two engage in kinkier pleasures as the days go by.  In the mean time, Lee continues the façade of a normal life, dating a bland boy named Peter (Jeremy Davies) who offers an equally bland future.  Eventually, he proposes; in a haze, Lee accepts.<br /><br />But she shouldn't have, and she knows it.  Mr. Grey's affections stop as he is overcome with guilt for what he has done to Lee.  He fires her and, we come to realize, perpetuates a cycle of anticipation, secret pleasure, and guilt.  But unlike the secretaries in the past, Lee has no intention of giving up on her man.<br /><br />The ending is at least as torturous as the movie itself is to watch.  Mr. Grey, disturbed at Lee's infatuation with him, orders her to sit at his desk and stay there until he says otherwise. Finally standing up for something, anything, Lee refuses to remove her palms from the desk.  For days.<br /><br />Secretary is a character piece, and Lee does not disappoint.  She puts her considerably talents, her raw vulnerability, before the camera both physically and emotionally.  She's so vulnerable, in fact, that it's sometimes hard to watch.<br /><br />Despite its subject matter, Secretary steadfastly refuses to exploit its characters.  Secretary lays the framework for a typical romance, despite the fact that it sometimes involves spanking and a horsewhip. We come to realize that these two deeply troubled people relate to each other through pain.  And as long as they trust each other, that's okay.<br /><br />Although it's certainly not for everybody, Secretary puts an entertaining twist on the usual boy meets girl format.  It's more girl meets boy, boy spanks girl, and they live happily ever after.Mr. Grey's affections stop as he is overcome with guilt for what he has done to Lee.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Mimi's return is truly a wondrous experience for those who really love Mariah Carey.  Most exciting this time out is mix of classic Mariah ballads along with new, hip-hop based funky tunes that will get you out of your seat, get your head nodding, and your hips swaying.  I'm sure you've heard the top rated We Belong Together over and over on the radio... but check out I Wish You Knew, which has a sweet visual of loving someone from afar.  And Snoop Dogg makes an appearance on Say Something... a very hip and kool piece that calls you to the dancefloor.  Mariah even gives those of us with spiritual roots a beautiful, moving tune (Fly Like a Bird).  <br /> <br />In today's hip hop and pop culture with so many manufactured artists and so many sampled songs, it's wonderfully refreshing to listen to a genuine creative genious with an awesome voice, signing about themes and situations that we all can relate to.  If you like Mariah, you'll love this album.  And if by chance you haven't gotten into Mimi yet, you're missing one of music's greatest pleasures.  Enjoy!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This great film shows the band at their utmost prime.  <br />I own the original video tape of this concert so was thrilled to see that this version has been completely re-mastered. There are more shots of the band as they play and visual reproduction of the show is top quality overall. Very few shots show the video origins of this film and I'm very pleased with the hard work that has gone into this version by all involved. <br />The sound has been totally re-mastered for a real and dramatic improvement. The dynamic range is awesome on even a lower level hi-fi system and on a 5.1 amp just blows you away.  <br />This is a must, not only for PF fans but also as a demo DVD for anyone who loves their hi-fi video reproduction.  <br />Thank you PF for releasing this. It is the definitive DVD of the band and frankly a historic masterpiece.
1400076943|1.0|it's surprising that so many people gave this book a favorable rating - did we read the same book? i found \\"purple hibiscus\\" a little to simplistic and childish for any accolades - there was no particular insight on any of the issues e.g. physical abuse, first love, teenage angst/rebellion - to speak of, and the political ranting towards the end is laughable. apparently, everyone that can write a few words is now styling themselves as political activists, i wonder where ms. adichie was during those tumultous times - enjoying the breeze well away from the conflict in london - and now she's spewing out all the stuff she probably heard from her parents. i doubt that any self-respecting nigerian - unless you're the type that thinks \\"mills and boons\\" are literary masterpieces - will find anything remarkable about this book. as for people who don't know anything about nigeria, or africa, i suggest you read chinua achebe, buchi emecheta, or wole soyinka (for the cerebral) to get a real flavor.

B000FSME1A|3.0|There is also a 3-disc version of Apocalypse Now available as a limited-time Circuit City promotion. The third disc contains a trailer for each version of the movie, a short documentary (7 minutes), and the missing \\"Destruction of the Kurtz Compound\\" scene both with and without commentary from F. Coppola. The third disc comes in a sleeve inserted into the packaging. There is a sticker on the packaging indicating the presence of the third disc (\\"while supplies last\\").<br /><br />I don't know if this material was intentionally withheld from the DVD solely for the purposes of this promotion, but if so, that is very disappointing and frustrating!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I was not sure if wanted to a add my voice to the multitude of corinne bailey rae reviews but the more I've listened to this CD, the greater I like it.  She is compared to Norah Jones...this is over-simplification.  She is a neo-soul r&b songstress marrying jazz and old school r&b.  She is more Erykah Badu than Sade, more 80's soul than 90's pop.  The oft played \\"put your record on\\" is nice house party groove.  \\"Enchantment\\" is a nice smooth jazz or downtempo track.  \\"Trouble sleeping\\" is a nice r&b/pop ballad that could be home on either radio format.  The song \\"breathless\\" is my personal favorite, a very hot late 80's style r&b power ballad.  She very retro but still contemporary, a true songstress who is hard to tie down to one genre!
B0007OY2P8|1.0|I second what J. Harris said, it was hard to follow, and it left out major parts in the book. <br /> <br />This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br />This is a case where the book is good, and the movie terrible. I would have given it a 0 star rating, but they had no 0.
B0000797IO|1.0|The Good Girl is a Horror of a film. It imagines itself as an ode to the everyman, trapped in a humdrum existence. What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a \\"Forrest Gump\\" imitation.  Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying.  <br /> <br />The film itself is grey and dull. The other characters in the film flat and stereotypical (i.e. the coworker who invites her to bible study).  <br /> <br />Overall this movie isn't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to DVD. In another era it probably would have never made it to the screen. Oh how I miss that era.....
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Modern Times leapfrogs directly over 2001's delightful but minor \\"Love and Theft\\" to join Time Out of Mind as one of Dylan's 5 best albums. (The other three are: Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks and take your pick.) The mood here is looser and more subdued than on the more aggressive, musically tighter \\"L&T\\" and yet every Modern Times track has its place and contributes to a powerful whole. What's more, the songs themselves are far more unified and coherent than anything on the previous album and Dylan's singing is far richer and more expressive.  <br />Standout cuts include the epic love song Spirit on the Water, the poetic country waltz When the Deal Goes Down, the gorgeous pop ballad Workingman's Blues #2 (which perversely is not a blues at all), the ethereally beautiful Nettie Moore (one of the most unusual cuts in the Dylan canon) and the dark and ominous album closer Ain't Talkin'; this last song begins with the lines \\"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden, the wounded flowers were dangling from the vine\\" and proceeds to paint an overwhelmingly devastating portrait of a metaphorical stroll through a world abandoned by God.  <br />The fact that Dylan has created this masterpiece 45 years into his career as a professional musician is astonishing and a cause for celebration. <br /> <br />The videos on the bonus DVD are music videos and live Dylan performances from 1993 - 2003. They are all excellent in quality and a treat to watch.
B000OTM1PO|4.0|SUPERMAN RETURNS takes place about five years after SUPERMAN II ended. In the film, Superman (Brandon Routh) left Earth five years ago when astronomers discovered the remains of his home planet of Krypton. Having to be certain that there was nothing left there, Superman left on an odyssey across the universe. In the meantime, life on Earth went on. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) was tired of waiting and became disillusioned and wrote an editorial entitled &#34;Why the World Doesn't Need Superman&#34; which finally netted her a Pulitzer. She also birthed a son and became engaged to Perry White's nephew (James Marsden). Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) went to jail and after years of good behavior was released early and immediately began planning his next diabolical plan. All the while, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) kept taking pictures. As for the rest of the planet, the Average Joes struggled to live in a world that increasingly became more violent, turbulent, and destructive.<br /><br />Having been released from prison, Lex Luthor befriends an extremely wealthy heiress and on her deathbed has her sign a will that leaves her entire fortune to him. Using his newly acquired wealth, Luthor travels with his new squeeze, Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey), to Superman's hideout, The Fortress of Solitude. Once there, he ease drops on some of the boy in blue's personal tapes from his Dad and steals some of the crystals. Later he breaks into a museum and steals some kryptonite. Meanwhile, Lois is having an emotional breakdown as she tries to figure out her life now that Superman has returned. As for Clark Kent, he's busy trying to fit back into work at the Planet after having been gone for a five-year world tour and Superman is out saving the world: everything from stopping a space shuttle from crashing to rescuing a stray animal from a tree. Everything seems to go according to Lex Luthor's plans.<br /><br />Superman has always been one of my favorite superheroes and there's not a whole lot that one can complain about in SUPERMAN RETURNS. It is true that in style and structure, SUPERMAN RETURNS closely follows in the footsteps of SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II while completely ignoring SUPERMAN III and SUPERMAN IV. There are scenes in the movie that are very similar to scenes in SUPERMAN, several lines are copied directly from that movie, and Luthor's motivation is the same as the first film, too. Nevertheless, with some solid acting from most of the cast (Routh doesn't get an opportunity to do much of his own acting--most of the time he's re-enacting Reeve's performance), state of the art special effects, and a great story, director Bryan Singer does an excellent job of keeping the golden boy tied to his roots, but allowing him to enter the 21st Century. As Lois Lane discovers, maybe the world really needs Superman after all.that one can complain about in SUPERMAN RETURNS. It is true that in style and structure, SUPERMAN RETURNS closely follows in the footsteps of SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II while completely ignoring SUPERMAN III and SUPERMAN IV. There are scenes in the movie that are very similar to scenes in SUPERMAN, several lines are copied directly from that movie, and Luthor's motivation is the same as the first film, too. Nevertheless, with some solid acting from most of the cast (Routh doesn't get an opportunity to do much of his own acting--most of the time he's re-enacting Reeve's performance), state of the art special effects, and a great story, director Bryan Singer does an excellent job of keeping the golden boy tied to his roots, but allowing him to enter the 21st Century. As Lois Lane discovers, maybe the world really needs Superman after all.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Modern Times leapfrogs directly over 2001's delightful but minor \\"Love and Theft\\" to join Time Out of Mind as one of Dylan's 5 best albums. (The other three are: Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks and take your pick.) The mood here is looser and more subdued than on the more aggressive, musically tighter \\"L&T\\" and yet every Modern Times track has its place and contributes to a powerful whole. What's more, the songs themselves are far more unified and coherent than anything on the previous album and Dylan's singing is far richer and more expressive. <br />Standout cuts include the epic love song Spirit on the Water, the poetic country waltz When the Deal Goes Down, the gorgeous pop ballad Workingman's Blues #2 (which perversely is not a blues at all), the ethereally beautiful Nettie Moore (one of the most unusual cuts in the Dylan canon) and the dark and ominous album closer Ain't Talkin'; this last song begins with the lines \\"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden, the wounded flowers were dangling from the vine\\" and proceeds to paint an overwhelmingly devastating portrait of a metaphorical stroll through a world abandoned by God.   <br />The fact that Dylan has created this masterpiece 45 years into his career as a professional musician is astonishing and a cause for celebration.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Bob Dylan's Modern Times is more like an A- than an A+, but it continues his winning streak. The lyrics are what we'd expect from Dylan. They are very vibrant for his age. Some songs really get back to his folk roots, while others are among his bluesiest. A couple of the bluesy songs, like \\"Thunder On The Mountain\\" are a bit bland, I have to say. But generally, he's quite successful in recreating Southern blues for our times. Vocally, he remains worn out - but it works, though it struggles with the length of the songs. Modern Times deserves its praise.
0060987464|2.0|This book tells some very interesting stories about the crazy life of being in such a popular band and all the usuals that go along with it: groupies, drugs, etc.  The thing that annoyed me about this book is Marilyn Manson's belief that society somehow molded him into becoming the person that he is or that he is a product of extreme circumstances (he references always being reminded that he was different).  While his childhood was definitely not what most people think of as normal, I got the impression that he is who he is by personal choice and nothing else.  This does give a sense of empowerment in the way that it says to people, you can be as different as you want to be without having to have an excuse for it.  However, this isn't the message this book tries to deliver; this book claims that it's not about choice it's about cause and effect (at least in my opinion). <br /> <br />So if you're just looking for an entertaining look into a different world, then this book will deliver.  But if you're looking for some insight into the human personality that some of the other reviewers seem to think is here, keep looking.
B000001FRY|5.0|I am simply dumb-struck when I read luke warm reviews of this album by U2 \\"fans\\". I know U2's music has evolved over the years, but my goodness gracious people!!! The beauty and majesty, the ineffable elegance of this record deserves our reverence and admiration, not just because they wrote these amazing songs as teenagers, or that NOTHING that came before it sounded ANYTHING like it--it was COMPLETELY original--or that it is everything that is great about U2 in simple, shimmering, unadulterated, perfection from beginning to end, but because it's just a great record by any standard. Just take 45 minutes, put on a pair of headphones, turn out all the lights in the room, open the shades to let in the moonlight, and open up to this musical movie. It's U2's childhood and teenage years (and yours too--'U2') wrapped up in the most chilling, unique, dark, and hopeful music rock n' roll has ever produced. What an amazing achievement is a song like \\"Twillight\\", for example, an unself-conscious minor symphony--and the record is filled with them! If you can't appreciate the beauty of this record, I really do feel sorry for you, not in a condescending way, just because it's so deeply brilliant, I wish everyone could feel the joy of it.... <br /> <br />Just do yourself a favor, fellow U2 fans; if you don't have this record, get it, and then put all your preconceived notions of what U2 should sound like, etc., aside and spend some time with this masterpiece--at least once at night, with headphones, in the moonlight--and I guarantee you'll thank me. <br /> <br />One of the reviewers here also said something ho-hum about 'War'. Trust me, this is another great, great record. The first three: Boy, October, War, represent an important era in U2's music, which is so Irish (This was before they became interested in 'the roots of rock n' roll' and their place in the legacy.) and so universal.... <br />  <br />Well, I think maybe I've gone on a little too much, so I'll wrap it up--GREAT MUSIC, don't miss out. <br /> <br />
B000E33VWW|5.0|After watching this film, it is very easy to see why this movie is so praised. Truman Capote was such a talented writer and this film really does bring his story and struggles to life and is brilliantly portrayed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Capote is shown as a caring person who tries to understand why these murders took place, only to hear and see things that would change his perspective on life. But, in the end, you don't really know how much he actually cared for the accused criminals. Indeed, there was feeling there, but you always get the hint that he is just using people to get his book finished.<br /><br />Once again, Hoffman did a superb job in his role. Excellent, all of the demons that Capote had to face are brilliantly expressed in the actions of this actor. The story itself is very intriguing and captivating. The writing is some of the best I have seen in a movie in a long time. Everything you have heard about this movie is absolutely correct and this movie isn't something to be missed.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Something is going on out there. Films like Hostel, Saws 1 & 2 Wolf Creek etc represent something new in Horror. <br /> <br />I found Hostel to be much more interesting than, say, Saw 2. Why? <br /> <br /> I can certainly see hating the film. That probably is the best response. But as I watched the film I suspected that a lot more was going on than met the eye. Obviously the film is supposed to be repulsive. And not all of the gore is supposed to be anatomically correct. But what's fascinating to me is how the film actually goes after the audience. Maybe some of the reaction against it is a feeling that you, the audience, are being attacked.  <br /> <br />What's the basic plot outline?  <br /> <br />A couple of typical American teen type guys go to Amsterdam to experience the legal illicit pleasures of open grass smoking and prostitution. Then they hear of something weirder so they follow the trail and mythology to Slovakia, where the girls are all just dying to give themselves to American guys. Then they have greedy dreamy sex and suddenly they find themselves in hell in some pay for torture dungeon (that was actually based on something real in Thailand). There on the film is about unbelievable torture and escape. Stupidity and naivete are crushed in the end.  <br /> <br />The teen guys in the beginning are so much a representation of exactly the audience at home that it is clear that the message of the film has to do with undermining the audience, which frankly really needs to be undermined. We Americans are so proud, dopey and naive that we may need films like this to make us shrink back into our seats a bit.  <br /> <br />Notice the film does not have any stock Goth images.  <br /> <br />The actual imagery is almost all World War 2, Communist, totalitarian and Holocaust which Americans don't have any natural defenses for, unlike Vampire and devil movies. Also because the movie was about paying to watch torture just as you have also paid to watch this torture yourself. The film also often goes for the eyes, which is an attack upon the film viewer. Eli Roth who is a very intelligent Jew certainly knows what the implications are, especially the Holocaust connections. In interviews (look for them online) he is quite articulate that the film questions the American frat boy attitude which sees Europe as a Disneyland of pot and hookers.  <br /> <br />The film also works because it gets close to the nerve of so much of the brutality in contemporary youth culture, then says you want torture? Fine. Here it is. But This does raise a lot of implications that should really be questioned. Saw 2 looks like a commercial work in comparison. Its pretty predictable. But then I had a pretty vivid recollection of Saw 1 when I watched it. I think the needle scene on Saw 2 is what really sticks (ooops pun alert) with everyone in that film. Hostel though is a central document of this epoch.  <br /> <br />(Plus Barbara Nedeljakova is a real find.) <br /> <br />The real question involving many newer films circles around this: Why has torture become a dominant motif today? Wolf Creek is also here in this category and may be the toughest to watch of all of them.  <br /> <br />Here is a suggestion of other films in this new category of  <br />Seventies Retro and Torture films excluding the recent crop of zombie films. They are all not on the same level to be sure. But as a unified message they nail something in the present. <br /> <br />* Highly Recommended to understand the style. <br /> <br />* Session 9 <br />* Machinist <br />Wrong Turn <br />* Saw <br />* Saw 2 <br />* Jeepers Creepers <br />Jeepers Creepers 2 <br />* Hostel <br />* Wolf Creek <br />Venom <br />* High Tension <br />The Hills Have Eyes <br />The Texas Chainsaw Massacre <br />* Silent Hill <br />The House of Wax <br />Cabin Fever <br />House of 1,000 Corpses <br />* The Devil's Rejects

B000002WU9|5.0|This is the greatest album in HIP HOP.  The best thing since the dj was able to scratch records.  NAS's verse (Verbal Intercourse)is his best verse in his career.  Probably the most fascinating display of lyrics in the English language by NAS!! Production was the best by the RZA.  These men poured it all out for you to listen and rise.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|If you've been waiting to buy a contemporary Dylan album, but don't want to get stuck with a CD that only Dylan fans could love, your wait is over.  Better than Time out of Mind, better than Love and Theft, MT is to my ears the best Dylan album in years. Too bad Dylan's voice is gone, as I would have liked to hear it with his old voice.  Nevertheless, Dylans straining vocals are integral to these calm musings of an older and wiser songman.  What really hooks you however is Dylan's backup band: efficient, competent, non-flashy and as good a group as Dylan has ever assembled since the years with the Band.      The album sounds better each time I listen to it.  The implicit meanings and fine shadings in Dylan's voice would be incredible in any artist, but that he pulls it off with his voice, as shot as it is, is amazing.  Dylan sings behind the beat, in front of the beat and basically dances around every song in rythmn with whatever lyrical impulses are driving him at the moment. This might not work with a lesser band behind him, but his backup band is definitely along for the ride on these tracks.    Dylans lyrics are really great on this album. The famed Dylan wit is in full evidence.  By turns tender, funny, angry and romantic, Dylan covers the full litany of modern complaints from the macro to the micro. Thankfully he avoids the facile rhymes that have characterized some of his recent offerings, and concentrates on the phrase rather than the word. There are new things to discover each time out.  I have had the CD on repeat now for several hours and am not tired of it yet.     That the album is Grammy bound is unmistakeable. I think it's good enough to win Album of the Year.
B00001U0E1|4.0|The writing is excellent. It's a simple story. Shakespeare is writing what will become ROMEO AND JULIET and he has a bit of writer's block. Then he falls in love and the words flow. But this simple story allows the writers to interweave \\"behind the scenes\\" with their favorite bits of Shakespeare himself. An accurate portrayal of the time in which he wrote, and the fact that he was basically just a working stiff trying to get by. A lot of clever jokes that someone knowledgeable about Shakespeare will enjoy, and far more clever jokes that someone who knows absolutely nothing about the master will also appreciate. Acknowledgement of the theories claiming someone else wrote his plays, and a much subtler rebuttal than I'd give. Exposure to the glorious language that flowed from Shakespeare's pen. The plot is contrived at times, but no more so than a few that Shakespeare himself gave us. This movie is a joy to watch.<br /><br />Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth. Of course. If you can think of a better choice, send me an email. Dench has the presence to elevate any role she chooses to take. She also has the unfortunate ability to expose the limitations of several other choices in this film. Joseph Fiennes took his role, that of a young William Shakespeare, seriously. He didn't always have the ability to pull it off, but he gave it his best shot, and there's no shame in that. Gwyneth Paltrow was a terrible choice. I can't watch an obviously stupid person. Oddly, however, she's wholly credible as Romeo.<br /><br />Oh well. I have other complaints, but they'd probably tell you more about me than about the film, so I'll stop now. It's worth watching more than once, and I can always hope it makes a few more people interested in Shakespeare's writings. This is another reminder that, for all the ink I spend bashing actors, Shakespeare came from them, and many of them still appreciate him.<br /><br />Allow me to clear up one common misconception about ROMEO AND JULIET, at the risk of repeating the very obvious. It's not a beautiful lovely greatest love story thing. It's about how teenagers who kill themselves over \\"life's one true love\\" are stupid.<br /><br />It was a pleasant surprise to see that Tom Stoppard is one of the writers. Didn't we all enjoy reading ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD back in high school? A little snooping around his bibliography shows me that he won an Oscar for SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, and that he's been involved in a number of other films I've enjoyed.risk of repeating the very obvious.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|It had been ages since I'd watched this. I saw it in a theater in the U.S. when it was new. And I was carrying many memories which were quite vague beyond the words, \\"This is great.\\" Remembering more detail than that was kinda like Clint's character, William Munny, trying to remember everybody he killed. It's been a long time, a lot of miles, and a whole lot of drinkin'.<br /><br />So, what are my thoughts on UNFORGIVEN this week, all these years later, watching the DVD at my home in China?<br /><br />First scene, a bad guy slices a whore's face. I was appalled. I thought that perhaps it was a good movie but maybe that scene was gratuitous. Or maybe they just wanted to show us, \\"That guy needed killin,\\" which is still a valid defense in the South. So, I decided to let it play.<br /><br />A bit later, Gene Hackman's kicking the mess out of Richard Harris. I was appalled again. And this film never got any kinder or gentler. But isn't Gene Hackman wonderful? What a performance. Has he ever made a bad movie? None I've seen.<br /><br />Finally, I remembered. This appalling, ugly violence was deliberate. When I first saw this movie, I'd been ingesting a steady diet of Hollywood, and I got the message even back then. I've been away from that diet a long time, and the message was even more obvious.<br /><br />(Too obvious? Not for the crowd that admires Dirty Harry.)<br /><br />Violent deeds carry heavy consequences. Gawd, that looks so flat as I type it. So trite. But heck, maybe you've seen some real world violence yourself. And then you see the Hollywood version. So different. This film did try to show us just how divergent the two are.<br /><br />A soldier in Iraq claimed that whenever you kill somebody, you kill a piece of yourself. True, and yet a slight bit simplistic at the same time. To explain why I write that would be to sermonize ad nauseum, which is something the film never does. It is what it is, folks. Watch it.<br /><br />The DVD also contains some very cool stuff about how it was made.contains some very cool stuff about how it was made.  <br />
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I cannot believe some the other reviews here - this is one outstanding recording - both sonically and musically.  Just superb.  Every song is a winner - not a bad track on the album at all - some of it just so deep and evocative - certainly the best new album for the last few years from anyone at all - beautiful melodies and excellent band and production - no one will be disapoointed by getting this album - a true work of beauty by a genius.  Get it.
B00005JKHP|4.0|How does this one stand up, 25 years after it was made? I'd only seen it once, in 1979, so it was like a new movie to me, except that I remembered the identity of V'ger and its less-than-spectacular ending (a man joins a computer).<br /><br />Will Decker foreshadowed Will Riker to an astounding degree. Decker's \\"old flame\\" the bald gal was quite similar to Riker's old flame years later. The new turtlehead Klingons looked pretty silly. The Kirk-Spock-McCoy chemistry was as it should have been, somewhat awkward at first and more or less back by the end. The different, antagonistic sort of chemistry between the old guard and the new characters worked quite well. V'ger foreshadowed the Borg more than I remembered, making Shatner's tie-in in his novel THE RETURN only natural. Uhura's new afro was a trip.<br /><br />Aside from these minor points of interest, the first hour was painful to watch. Ponderously slow. They finally had the freedom to spend all the money they wanted on special effects, and they went nuts. Let's fly slowly -- very slowly -- outside the ship for at least 10 minutes that seem much longer showing every little nook and cranny, with far too many reaction shots from Kirk (in his prime, complete with sideburns) and Scotty. With a DVD you can fast forward. The \\"she's not ready to fly\\" crap was old before it started, the transporter death was overdone, and the wormhole melodrama was just plain stupid. I didn't even like the muted new color schemes.<br /><br />Then something magical happened. V'ger itself isn't exactly the most original plot device we've ever seen. The plot has a large dose of Star Trek cliches, sci-fi cliches, and Star Trek cliches that became sci-fi cliches. But Star Trek plots were never more than the vessels which carried the ideas. The questions posed by the existence of V'ger moved me like no other \\"classic\\" Star Trek. The overall mood of everything, from the earlier slow pace to the muted color schemes, is unlike any other Star Trek. Dark like Roddenberry's EARTH TWO, or even \\"documentary\\" like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.<br /><br />Alan Dean Foster, whose writing I never respected before, was trying to boldly go where no Star Trek had gone before. And we rejected it, so Star Trek never went there again. Instead, THE WRATH OF KHAN gave us testosterone, people ate it up, and there went the franchise. Yes, Star Trek could always do testosterone with the best of them, but only as a change of pace, whereas now we're all sick of it. \\"Oh, let's go fight another nemesis.\\" Wake me up when you win.<br /><br />I didn't appreciate STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE when it was released because I was 16 years old.

B000FP2Z0S|5.0|........band in the world. This however is not their best album. Siren song is their best, or even the unravelling depending on the mood i'm in. Not to say this isnt a classic album however. Standout tracks are ready to fall and prayer of the refugee. <br />Also, if you have a copy of the disc with the bonus track Built to last it is a f.ucking wicked Sick of it all cover. Highly recommended.
B0007OCG56|1.0|This is [...]. I suppose anybody who'd hire Adam Sandler and/or Tea Leone lacks the ability to create anything that we who are descended from Cro Magnon man could watch. I lasted 20 minutes. The \\"jokes\\" are older than me, and they weren't funny when they were born.<br /><br />There is a world that exists nowhere except in American TV and film. It's an ugly place where nobody acts human, preferring to cling to stale stereotypes. A place where writers without talent set their stories. A place they grew up watching on American TV and in films, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle. This film is set in that world. No human being has ever been to this place, because it only exists in the minds of hacks.<br /><br />From the writer and director who brought us BROADCAST NEWS, which I reviewed recently. It, too, was in the pretend world, but that was okay because it was a film about a TV show and it had a bit of wit and perception. This has none of either.<br /><br />It's a damn shame this is the only way Cloris Leachman can get work.

0780020685|5.0|A 1954 classic by Akira Kurosawa which I will now review with no suspense whatsoever about whether I'll laud it or bash it.<br /><br />First impression. Does he play to stereotypes about the Japanese, send up the stereotypes, or do both at the same time? Probably both. However, he never drifts into falsehood. This is how Japanese people acted in the days of the samurai, and also in 1954. The bandits, the farmers, the samurai. Don't doubt it. With insights about how they act now, and in fact how all people think. Literature transcends time and place, folks, and literature is what this is. Damn entertaining, too.<br /><br />Second impression. I tend not to care about black and white versus color. Technology, that's all. But Kurosawa-san did such a remarkable job of using black and white in this case that to colorize it would be a crime. You may never hear me give a hoot again. But the contrasts are so visible, and so appropriate to the mood. Don't remake it, don't Ted Turnerize it, don't do anything to it except watch and enjoy. I betcha I could know exactly what was happening even without my glasses. Kurosawa is good, and I mean goooooooood.<br /><br />Third impression. His use of scenery. His use of music. His use of silence. His absolutely perfect eye for finding the right faces. We all know the stereotype, right? All Asians look alike. Not so in my classrooms, since I've lived here for over 5 years, but sometimes films can mess with me. Not this one! Distinctive faces, and all so damn expressive. So let's also shoot down the stereotype of inscrutability. These technical details grate on us when done wrongly, but perhaps we forget to laud those who get it right. This classic by young Kurosawa most definitely \\"got it right.\\"<br /><br />Blurred impressions after that.<br /><br />Our director/screenwriter has a real knack for dialogue that you just want to quote. Grab the person (or cat) beside you and say, \\"Did you hear that?\\" Then you repeat it and come across as an idiot. But hey, it's like that. In translation, even. What's it like in the original? It's like what we like.<br /><br />Plot summary. 30 or 40 bandits terrorize a poor farming village, same as they did many such villages back in those days, but this one manages to hire seven samurai. \\"Will work for rice\\" or something like that. The interaction and individuality among these guys sets the standard against which all such movies must be judged. I either haven't seen or can't remember the movies in your minds. Unforgiven, Three Amigos, Three (really four) Musketeers, Magnificent Seven, Dirty Dozen, Eight Million Morons. It doesn't matter. SEVEN SAMURAI is the gold standard, folks.<br /><br />It's very easy, and lazy, to fall into the old trap of hiring mercenaries and letting them do the rest. It's also false. Our farmers happen to be human beings as well. We have training, teamwork, misunderstandings, conflict, thinking and planning by both saviors and saved, and compromise. Also, I must forcibly interject, realism. Would you really give the heroes your rice and not your opinions on how to save your posterior? I think not.<br /><br />Kurosawa has the amazing ability to switch from comic to dramatic so fast that it's like a punch in the gut. He also shows welcome restraint in not doing so for the first hour or so. You don't expect it. No, you don't. That increases the impact. It's called understatement, folks. A rare and wondrous gift. As are wit, humor, and irony so sharp it almost draws blood.<br /><br />The subplots add to the whole, making it greater than the sum of its parts. Some thoughts on war which ring quite true, not injected as sermonizing but integral to characterization. A wee bit of comic relief injected precisely where we need it and to remarkable effect. An author who never forgets that his first priority is to entertain us, the readers. Um, viewers. Sorry. He blurs the line between filmmaker and novelist. You can't know how much I wish more filmmakerswould do that.<br /><br />In other words, and this ain't no surprise, I highly recommend this film. And, at over 3 hours, it's good value.much I wish more filmmakers would do that.  <br /> <br />In other words, and this ain't no surprise, I highly recommend this film.

B00000J8EK|5.0|I actually rate this as a 4-and-a-bit star album but rounded it up to 5 to redress the generally average reviews it's received over the years. While I enjoy reading the music press, sometimes they get it plain wrong; such, I feel, is the case with 'Surrender'. Many reviews have unfavourably compared it with the Chems' previous album 'Dig Your Own Hole', claiming 'Surrender' to be a flat and/or repetitive follow-up. In my opinion nothing could be further from the truth.  <br /> <br />'Dig Your Own Hole' sits at the hard-edged pioneering end of big beat, relying on riff and huge rhythm to drive the tracks home; it's a fine album if that is what you are seeking. 'Surrender' is a TOTALLY different beast; it's more of a house/chill album and a far more painterly affair than its generally monchromatic predecessor.  <br /> <br />On 'Surrender', the Chems focus more on sonic adventure and melodic texture than on big beat. This lends it a greater variety of atmosphere, and whilst it is not uniformly excellent and does run slightly out of puff towards the end it is still a rich and rewarding listen, with a greater variety of styles than any of their other releases. Consider the singles culled from it - 'Music:Response', 'Out Of Control', 'Let Forever Be' and 'Hey Boy Hey Girl'; add memorable tracks such as 'Influence', 'Got Glint' and my all-time favourite Chems track 'The Sunshine Underground' and you've got an album for many moods and occasions, more so than on any of their other releases, fine though they are. Sure, it has some lesser tracks but they help rather than hinder; I can play it before I go out or after I come home, or Tuesday night, Sunday afternoon, whenever. It sits at the poppier end of electronica, and is definitely recommended for those who like an album to take them somewhere and are happy to enjoy the ride.
0800141660|5.0|Jane Austen was so wonderful at creating reality on the printed page. She sent up society by spot-on accurate portrayals of it. I feel like stressing this point. It sends up pretension by accurately portraying it. It is humour and realism at the same time. I can think of nobody better at doing this.<br /><br />But, that isn't the only reason her writing survives and thrives today. If I, a 21st century American guy, had half her literary gifts, and could do absolutely anything at all with my literary ability, I'd choose to focus it upon the very same issues that Austen did. Meaning, she's every bit as relevant as she was back then.<br /><br />How does that translate to film? In this instance, flawlessly. Emma Thompson wrote an excellent screenplay, Ang Lee directed it wonderfully, everything about this production was equally top-notch, and I'm quite impressed.<br /><br />We look at some events from one character's point of view, then another. Both feel so real, yet they contradict each other in some way. Who's right? Austen was so excellent at capturing those dilemmas. We learn from this. We think about this. And, it's for damn sure we enjoy this.<br /><br />Forgive me for the cliche, but it fits. You see the characters in Austen's novels or this film and you think, \\"I know him. I know her.\\" And, if you're receptive, you notice, \\"I do that. Why?\\" This is why we write, folks. It's also why we read. We want that feeling, and it stays with us for days.<br /><br />You know I love good dialogue. It's damn hard to get right, isn't it? Jane Austen got it right, every time. You feel what isn't said as much as you do what is said, and it always rings 100% true.<br /><br />Jane Austen also had quite a clever wit. I challenge you to watch this film without laughing at something that is so accurate that you simply have to laugh. You can't do it.<br /><br />Do I need to tell you this one's a keeper? Nah, you probably guessed as much. But I can tell you this. Now I also understand why Jane Austen is so popular in China. Or anywhere else she happens to be popular. This is life, folks. Watch, or read, and enjoy.Now I also understand why Jane Austen is so popular in China. Or anywhere else she happens to be popular. This is life, folks. Watch, or read, and enjoy.
B000GUJHIA|3.0|Tony Judt attempts to cover a great deal of ground in this one volume. For perhaps this reason alone, much of his analysis is rather superficial and distorted. For what professes to be a general history of Europe, this book seems to devote an inordinate amount of attention to the experiences of the Jews. Moreover, there is an entire chapter on Europe's reaction to the genocide of Jews.<br /><br />Judt (p. 804) asserts that 97.5% of Polish Jews were exterminated by the Germans. The actual figure is closer to 90%. He supports the alleged uniqueness of Jewish victimhood by asserting that Jews could not in principal survive under Nazi German rule, while Poles could (p. 823). This is patently untrue. Poles, like Jews, had absolutely no rights under German rule. In German eyes, Poles were untermenschen (subhumans). Any Pole, like any Jew, could be killed by a German at any time for any reason or for no reason at all. Of course, the Germans had no choice but to treat Poles and Jews differently. For one thing, can it seriously be supposed that exterminatory German attitudes and tactics would have been the same had there existed a few hundred million European Jews but only a few million Slavs?<br /><br />To his credit, Judt (p. 816) acknowledges the fact that Hitler never intended to treat western Europeans to the barbarous ferocity to which he subjected Poland and the rest of the east. While noting the fact that 3 million Polish gentiles were murdered by the Germans (p. 822), he fails to mention that this was part of a genocidal process that targeted Poland's intelligentsia, costing the lives of about 50% of educated Poles. Judt (p. 16) acknowledges the fact that Warsaw was torched and dynamited by the retreating Germans, but fails to acknowledge the fact that this was part of a last-ditch attempt at cultural genocide against the Poles. As a further example, the Germans laid explosives within the architectural treasures of Krakow and Czestochowa, failing only to complete the operation owing to the actions of the Polish Underground and the unexpectedly-rapid advance of the Red Army.<br /><br />In common with many other authors, Judt (p. 102) exaggerates the danger that the western Allies faced in antagonizing Stalin over Poland. No mention is made of the fact that Stalin was heavily reliant on western Lend-Lease aid, which could have been judiciously dispensed to keep Soviet imperial ambitions in check. Judt (p. 586) criticizes Pope John Paul II's description of Poland as a \\"vast concentration camp\\" in the wake of martial law following the 1981 crackdown on the Solidarity movement. Judt's attitude smacks of gross insensitivity, and ignorance of what it is like to live in a foreign-imposed totalitarian society.<br /><br />Judt (p. 821) repeats the stereotyped charge, without presenting any supporting evidence, that locals in eastern Europe were more prone to assist in the killing of Jews by the Germans than the locals of western Europe. Ironically, perhaps, he demolishes his own claim when he focuses on the collaborationist regime of Vichy France (pp. 815-816). The reader may be shocked to learn that the French Jews were moved around France without seeing a single foreigner until the moment they were actually handed over to the Germans for extermination!  One wonders why the western media has so much fascination with the relatively trivial actions of Poles against Jews (Jedwabne, Kielce, etc.) and virtually none in the monstrous anti-Jewish actions of Vichy France.<br /><br />As is common in western publications, Judt (p. 43) presents a very superficial description of anti-Jewish events in postwar Poland. No mention is made of the crushing poverty and desperate housing shortage of postwar Poland or of the fact that only some 1% of postwar Jewish property reacquisitions ever encountered murderous Polish resistance. As for the Kielce Pogrom, there is ample evidence that it was a well-preplanned staged Communist provocation.<br /><br />Incommon with many other authors, Judt complains that, after WWII, neither Europe in general (p. 805), nor Poland in particular (p. 822) singled out the Jews as victims of the Nazi Germans. This ignores historical reality. The notion that Jewish sufferings are higher than those of non-Jews, or otherwise deserving of noticeably more attention than the latter, did not become current among either gentiles or Jews until some 20 years after the war.on. <br /> <br />In common with many other authors, Judt complains that, after WWII, neither Europe in general (p. 805), nor Poland in particular (p. 822) singled out the Jews as victims of the Nazi Germans.

B000FVQYZY|5.0|A sometimes overly obvious combination of Queen, Pink Floyd and Radiohead....but who cares? Those bands were great and this album has just enough rear-kicking guitar rifts and spacy disco beats to give your ears a feast of sounds and styles to head-bobble to - or bang if you must. Despite their choice of hilarious videos (specifically Knights of Cydonia), this band should be taken very seriously. It may alienate die-hard alternative fans who only paid attention because they thought they heard Thom Yorke, but it's okay to leave melloncollie behind for a few hours - it is a fantastic follow up to the first album.
B000007443|5.0|Mike Brecker, Elaine Elias, Peter Erskine, Eddie Gomez, and Mike Manieri all star on this first \\"Steps Ahead\\" album. They were forced to change their name from Steps to avoid a lawsuit from a similarly named company. Anyway, the music is absolutely fantastic, all players really stretch and obviously enjoy themselves. Along with Smokin' in the Pit, this would be my top pick for this group, counting only the Brecker including releases. Highly recommended.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|After Time Out of Mind and Love and Theft, expectations were decidely high for this. While Dylan has delivered another 'good' album, it comes as a slight let down after his last two albums: around half the album is taken up by rock and roll boogies like Thunder on the Mountain. While this type of song was well suited for Love and Theft, here the softer production dulls them, and they lack character. <br /> <br />You're six songs until  Modern Times stops sounding like Love and Theft lite and we get the first great song of the album: Workingman's Blues 2. It feels like a more natural Dylan song, and comes almost as a relief. There are then a scattering of good songs which make up for the album's tepid first half, though The Levee's Gonna Break is basically Love and Theft's Summer Days running half-steam.  <br /> <br />It's true what other reviewers have said: it's a mixture of his last two albums, but lacks the balls of Love and Theft and the lush sound of Time Out of Mind. I'm happy with it, but I just hope Dylan will tinker with his sound a bit more another five years from now.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is a combination of Tetris, chess and Chinese Checkers. It is incredibly easy to learn, and as tactically challenging as chess (I am an intermediate chess player). With four players, it is as riling as Monopoly (\\"why are you after ME all the time????\\"). The two player version is more calculable, as the pieces are fewer. I highly recommend both the 4 and 2 player versions of the game.

B000EJ9MTW|1.0|horrible , ameturish, sophomoric, this band and their fellow neighbors jet are BULL*@*@ I dont know how bands that take their influences and do nothing with them get away with it. Theres no inspired writing here, just take a band you love and sound like them...I cant believe how horrible this band is and people respect it. Every single artist has influences but to take them point blank and present them as something new is distasteful and disrpectful... <br /> <br />too make matters worse, they cant  play. I feel like Im listening to a high school band at the talent show covering their fav sabbath song who could mess up and have to start over at anytime....Beware of this garbage
B0006399FS|5.0|It is easy to intellectually criticize music or any work.  As a result, it is far to easy to miss a genuinely authentic feeling.  The songs on this CD are a declaration of love and faith, not an attempt to create a cutting edge sound (no pun intended).  U2 are still a great band because at a time when it would be so easy to coast on their success or make a piece of musical maturbation, they surprise us with music of love and faith.  You can try and criticize those feelings all you want, but you end up sounding like you missed the point.  Put on some good sounding head phones, burn a few candles, play the cd, and be surprised by joy.
0679805273|5.0|We love all our Dr. Seuss books.  This one is so creative and fun.  The wording is clever and cute, and the creativity is fantastic!
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This album is fantastic, but since I have seen Ray live four or five times, I was expecting more.<br /><br />Ray in his interviews and on his cds is quite shy and a bit mellow.  His live show is a different story.  He screams, hollers and bellows with the best of them.  I would donate a limb to hear him cover \\"Fortunate Son\\" by CCR.<br /><br />This album is definitely still a five star, but that is easy for Ray to do.  The cd is largely quiet, mellow and relatively safe for Ray.<br /><br />The best track is \\"Barfly\\" and I can't get it out of my head.  This affected me similar to \\"Jolene\\" off his amazing first album, \\"Trouble.\\"<br /><br />\\"Three More Days\\" is the most upbeat song and is quite good.<br /><br />\\"You can bring me Flowers\\" has a nice groove.<br /><br />The rest of the songs, while beautiful and quite enjoyable, are a bit slow for me.<br /><br />The following lyric from one of Ray's live songs (which he has yet to record) best decribes my desire to hear Ray sing more barnburning, swamp screamers:  \\"You gotta what I need ... Why don't you give me some?\\"<br /><br />This album was pretty ... how about a BAD (meaning good) one next?
0694003611|5.0|Now that I have a son I realize why this book was given to me 5 times.  It is so sweet and simple with beautiful colors.  The book is soothing.  My son always hands it to me to read.  A real classic.
B000B5XZLU|3.0|It seems like after the success of \\"Alright\\" waned (that video was always played on BET for some reason), people stopped paying attention to Jamiroquai. Still, I decided to check out their latest album, Dynamite, to see if JK and the bunch still had it.<br /><br />Well, it's a little hard to tell. After listening to all of their albums, I've come to the conclusion that Jamiroquai is really only JK with a revolving door backup band (New Radicals, anyone?). That isn't the real problem, however; basically, as a few other reviewers hinted at, all their songs pretty much started to sound the same after a while, thus coining the first song, \\"Feels Just Like It Should\\". None of the songs really sound bad (well, actually, \\"(Don't) Give Hate a Chance\\" is pretty cheesy), but this is basically just a safe album for Jamiroquai fans, or for fans of club/disco music.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000GFLAI0|5.0|What's left to say?: Dylan always writes lyrics that are worth listening to; clever and about something. How often does anyone else do that?   The only matter to discuss is who he's playing with: These guys  KILL. All you have to do is listen to the video here to know that this band is as good as it gets.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Who knew that two \\"different\\" artists pairing up on one or two songs and then trying the pairing on an entire album would actually work? We all know the mistake that happened with R. Kelly and Jay-Z; then Ludacris and Sum 41 even tried it for a minute (and after watching that Saturday Night Live performance, I'm glad that that proposed album never came to fruition). But Cee-Lo and DJ Danger Mouse joined forces for a whole album and tagged themselves Gnarls Barkley, after which putting out the nearly-classic St. Elsewhere.<br /><br />Keep in mind, though: Cee-Lo's style has never been for everyone, so if you couldn't get into him before, you probably won't be able to get into him NOW either. And those of you looking for Goodie Mob Cee-Lo won't find that either -- well, except for maybe \\"Feng Shui\\". But it was a wise idea to release \\"Crazy\\" because it's the most accessible song on the album.<br /><br />That's not to say the rest of the songs aren't great, though; Cee-Lo's vocals over Danger Mouse's production help to produce standout after standout, like \\"Who Cares\\", \\"Storm Coming\\" and the playful \\"Boogie Monster\\". There's even an interesting cover of Violent Femmes' \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" on here.<br /><br />I'm sure even people like me that can get into this album will still have their say as to what song could have been left behind. MY choice would have to be \\"Necromancer\\", even though I realize it's just a song (and if you don't know what necrophilia is, trust me; you don't WANT to know). The songs are also a little too brief (14 tracks in 37 minutes). Other than that, St. Elsewhere is everywhere you'd want to be.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B0000046W9|5.0|I have many many Stan Getz cds. I treasure this box set since 1990 I guess the year that I bought it. I know it by memory now, but nevertheless it always sounds fresh and superb. The quality of the music contained here can't be underestimated maybe only because it had success (something that jazz purist often do, critizise a music only because it sold big numbers). This music is something that words can't do justice. The encounter between Stan Getz and bossa nova and its artists was made in Heaven. Here superlatives are not enough believe us (believe to me and to all the other enthusiastic reviewers). It's a music so beautiful, so perfect that it flows with a divine smoothness. This music seems easy to uneducated people and they may even appreciate it just because it sounds so \\"simple\\". But it seems easy only because the musicians who played this music, Stan first, are unbelievable, superb artists. This music is amazing and really, can change the face of a lot of your days. A lot of people already told you what you can find here. Everything Stan recorded in bossa fashion. I only want to say that this box has inside itself a lot of happiness that the amazing music Stan and the others who played it will give you for years and years to come. Think about this, money are only paper. This box will send you shivers down your spine for years and will be a pure emotion each time you'll listen to it. What would you choose ..  to have a bigger wallet or to be a happier person? I'd pay probably 1000 dollars for this music if it would be the only way to own it.
B000G759LW|5.0|Definitely love this album. Upon first listen I wasn't too sure, but after a few times I realized that it lives up to her usual great vocals and melodies. The main reason Christina is such an excellent singer is her ability and range and this album highlights it as always. The one thing I wasn't too impressed about was the fact this really is a \\"theme\\" album with all the songs pretty much reflecting an older, blues, jazzy style, but it still delivers. Some of my favorites are \\"Understand\\", \\"Save me From Myself\\" and \\"Slow Down Baby\\". If you're a Christina fan or like powerful singers you won't be disappointed!
B000GW8RX4|5.0|Yeah! I have been eagerly awaiting this DVD - and now I'm thrilled. THIS is the way music DVDs should be done. You can see the effort and care to make this DVD worthy of a legendary band. <br /> <br />First of all, \\"Rainbow - Live in Munich 1977\\", released just a few days ago, contains a whole concert, un-cut, with the running time of almost 2 hours! It was recorded on 20th October 1977, just a couple of hours after Blackmore was released from Austrian jail! But for the details of that interesting story, you'll just have to buy the DVD (can I now have a special discount, Amazon guys?) :) <br /> <br />Show is phenomenal, spectacular! I especially enjoy watching Dio, who really gives it all ...and David Stone (keyboards) is also amazing. The only thing which I dislike (REALLY dislike) - is the ending. Blackmore's little \\"performance\\" at the end is totally out of contest (and without good taste). You have to see it to believe it. For me, this concert is like beautiful fairy-tale with a dreadful end. But who knows, maybe you like it. <br /> <br />Picture quality is not so great, but it was recorded in '77, so... don't let that pull you away from buying this. Sound is GREAT - and you can choose between dolby stereo, dolby 5.0 and dts surround. <br />Sleeve and menu desings are just the way we like it - simple, but very, very nice. :) <br />AND... we get tons of cool extra stuff! Just the way we like it. :) <br />- 3 promo videos <br />- new interview with Bob Daisley (20+ minutes!) <br />- shorter interview with Colin Hart <br />- both interviews accompanied with old photos, video-shots, newspapers scans... <br />- nice photogallery <br />- narrative story about Rainbow (40 minutes!!) accompanied with static scenes from Munich show. <br /> <br />But my favourite \\"extra stuff\\" is not on the disc. Most music DVDs have none or one booklet. Here, we get 2 booklets! One is 6-page story about Rainbow and technical info about this DVD. The other one is 20-page faithful reproduction of the original Rainbow tour programme! Very beautiful, fantastic quality, lots of info and pictures. <br /> <br />This DVD is worth every penny, and much more. It's A-MUST-HAVE for any Rainbow fan, and it's an example how we want music DVDs to look like. Easily 5 stars for Rainbow and two thumbs up for Eagle Vision. <br />;)
B000051VWW|5.0|For all of you that may have thought I only panned dance compilations, get ready to feast your eyes on this review.  I have been a fan of Sade since God was a boy.  Her music, although viewed by many as simple, has more soul than just about anything you can hear on television or radio.  Instruments used to deliver her mood ebb and flow like a gentle tide against a moonlit beach.  One of her many talents is that she never feels the need to \\"kill\\" her songs with overblown meaningless orchestrations.<br /><br />I loved every track on this CD; however, my favorite is \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\\".  \\"I've been torn apart so many times.  I've been hurt so many times before.  So, be careful and be kind.\\"  I'm sure that just about every person who would listen to those lyrics could relate because if you've ever been in love, well...you get the idea.<br /><br />Kudos to you, Sade.  In a time where most music is souless, uninspired, and insipid, you are definitely a breath of fresh air.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I adore this cd.  I am a massage therapy studnet & bought this cd after a friend/coworker shared one of the songs w/me.  Corrine's voice is awesome - soft, soothing & perfect to pop in when you want to relax.  I just finished a shift at school & played the cd all through my massages today & my clients really seemed to enjoy it.  This is my new fav to listen to at work!  Buy it, you won't be sorry!

080017948X|5.0|Along with \\"The Fisher King\\" (Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges), one of my favorite movies. In both films, selfesh, self-centered arrogant men are transformed and redeemed by genuine compassion and love. Both movies are also, in part, hilarious.  See them as  a \\"double bill\\" and learn some of life's best lessons.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|God knows how these two ever got together or why it took so long, but it was worth the wait. I only buy 2-3 CD's per year. I heard Beachcombing and made a beeline for Amazon to buy my own. <br />Wonderful harmonies, great Knopriffs and some fine string backup. A long time since we have had a male-female duet this good.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|The worst thing I can point out about this album is that on Austin City Limits and Live at Bonaroo, during track #2 \\"Empty\\",  the bass player punctuated Ray's pondering of \\"Will I always feel this way?\\" with the coolest hook in the song. A fill that to me is as important to that song as any lyric. It ain't present on this rendition and it makes me feel like a track is missing. What gives?    The only other criticism is that I like to hear Ray cut loose more, but that seems to surface more during live performances.    That being said, and those being the only complaints I have, this album is a second installment of goosebumps. Haunting lyrics and hypnotic chords that give you a glimpse into Ray's soul like, well, like Ray does. I enjoy every song.    I hear more influences on this album than on \\"Trouble\\" (Lou Reed, Michael McDonald, Paul Simon, The Beatles) but I attribute that mostly to the addition and heavier mix of strings, horns, electric piano, guitar leads, and background vocals. And none of that detracts from making this album all Ray. I wish whoever recorded, mixed/mastered this album had done so with every album in my collection, as it is flawless.     I cannot wait to see or hear this album live. SEE HIM LIVE and you get to a whole new level.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I am a big Will Ferrell fan!  REALLY BIG!!!  I enjoy just about every one of his movies, with the possible only exception of \\"Night at the Roxbury.\\"  But this is no \\"Night...\\" and Will Ferell is no ordinary comedian.  He is, quite easily one of the funniest men on the face of this earth.<br /><br />I like this movie, because it really doesn't take itself seriously, which is just fine by me, and describes Will Ferrell's lifestyle as well.<br /><br />Call him what you will, I call him a genius!<br /><br />Two hard thumbs up!<br /><br />Stay Sassy, San Diego!<br /><br />MC White said: Check it out!!!
B000B19BCG|5.0|The Best Supergrass cd out there. The sound of this cd is like no other. It has a \\"pop\\" ish feel that captures attention. Amazing
B000HCO840|1.0|Just to let you know that Brett Ratner messed up the X-men saga.  This hack director decided that the movie did not need a story-line and shot it anyways.  Don't waste your time with this movie instead watch a real excellent comic book \\" Superman Returns\\".
B00064X3KO|5.0|I had a bad quality copy of Jamie Cullum's Twentysomething that I had fallen in love with, and shared with my family and friends; and they fell in love with it too! After seeing him in concert in my town, and finding out that there was actually a special edition of this cd; I rushed onto Amazon and bought it. I absolutely love it! It's much better quality than the one I had, and showcases Jamie's amazing talent. Many of the songs he arranged himself, which I think is rather impressive since he was so young (bear in mind though, that I am no music expert). And a few of the songs on the album are written by him, too. He does some more classic songs as well, and even manages and cover of Jimi Hendrix and Radiohead. All in all, this is one of the best cd's that I own, and I will continue to wear it out in my player for years to come!
0895260131|4.0|Hate to break the news, but if you want to hear the \\"word\\" from the proverbial horse's mouth to validate or diminish the points of this well researched and truly eye-opening book, there are 3 comparative translation of the Quoran available on the internet. By the way, would someone please explain why is the good Lord of the Muslims is unable to convey his thoughts beside arabic. Last time I checked the Bible was translated into almost every languages and the readers around the world don't seem to be confused about the context. How is that, that the guy who creates the universe, populates it with all living things, hookes up Mohammed with 72 virgins, fizzles when it comes to explain his requierements to his own creations, unless they're Arabs and gets stomped by english. Mind you, we are not talking about an obscure eskimo dialect, but one of the most widely used tongue. Not so mighty after all....Maybe this is why the reaction is usually beheading or the blowing up of schoolchildren when someone dares to ask the obvious question. If Islam really a divine message, how come it's only understandable to a small group of people? On the other hand, if it's just a bloodthirsty gutter-cult...you got the point.
0618164413|5.0|In the first week of August we took our two children - aged 4 1/2 and 2 1/2 - to see the movie of Curious George. Both loved it. As a matter of fact my wife and I had never before enjoyed a childrens movie as much as we did this one about Curious George. <br />However the stories aren't translated in Dutch yet, so we decided to buy this complete collection instead. It's great! The adventures of Curious George translate very easily in Dutch while reading it aloud to the children, and the children love to make up their own stories looking at the terrific drawings of Curious George and all his friends. Bedtime has become the best time, 'cause that's Curious George time! <br />
0684824906|4.0|This massively delicious work is bound to be lapped up by Lincoln enthusiasts and Civil War buffs like cats to cream.  Richly folding in tantalizing detail and authentic accounts of events, conversations, and attitudes, author Goodwin creates a highly delectable feast of historical pleasures all the while educating us to levels rarely encountered in the public venue.<br /><br />Gentle readers are advised, however, that this is less a biopic of Lincoln than a study of the dynamics of his political life, and his relationships to other participants of the age.  It is a study of the Team. None-the-less it is a dynamic and personable work.  If you seek a look into the drama of Lincoln's marriage to the volatile Mary Todd, or the rigors of his melancholia, you will only find halfway side-glances at those aspects of his complicated life.<br /><br />Instead, you will read of the fealty of Seward, the ambition of Chase, the home loving qualities of Bates, and learn the personalities of other key players in our nation's history; those who understood the concept of `big picture' and who put the welfare of the democratic state above any machinations aimed toward personal gain. (Would that we had more of that spirit today.)<br /><br />Grandly, it is driven home that Lincoln, through his life and continuing into his presidency, was a self-educated and self-made man of the highest integrity and attentiveness.  Any perceived blunders of the early half of his administration may be attributed to his ignorance of things military, and his reliance on less than worthy advisors until such time as he got his own mind sufficiently schooled to be able to take the reins of power more firmly in hand.<br /><br />The book is also an excellent look at the issue of the political path to the dissolution of the southern slavery institution. Unfortunately less a moral issue than an economic one, attitudes regarding the hideous practice are displayed through direct accounts of the Dred Scott decision, and struggles over proposed laws regarding the permission of slavery in the western territories.  The interests of Europe, and Britain in particular, to maintain the slave-based economy are well explained.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit Proof Fence is the true story of 3 girls who walked 1500 miles to find their way home. It's the story of a daring escape and an epic journey.<br /><br />It's a story on many levels - the pain of separation, the yearning for home, the traps of culture and ideology, the power of the state, colonialism, faith and survival. It painfully depicts the policy of cultural and anthropological genocide of the Australian Aboriginal Peoples. And it's a moving story of great courage and the strength of the human spirit. The little girls will stay with you for a long, long time.<br /><br />This isn't an easy film to entertain you for a short while.  It gets hold of you and twists your stomach. It takes hold of your heart too, and lifts you out of your armchair in elation, and triumph. It's not a film that you forget.<br /><br />In 1931, three aboriginal girls are forcibly removed from their homes to be trained as domestic staff for white families. They escape and set off on a trek across the Outback.<br /><br />Rabbit Proof Fence is a cinematic statement against the lack of respect that 'civilised' societies have for other cultures. It also illustrates the infinite power of the human spirit with outstanding simplicity for it's a simple enough story based on real people and events. It conveys a solemn air of the determination and maturity of soul of the girls in the story and richly characterises the Outback to which they return as a reflection of their stone-faced will and intensity.<br /><br />This is a rare and moving film, a magnificent account of courage dramatised with true visual poetry.
B000GFLAI0|3.0|I am a diehard Dylan fan, but his past two albums, while terrifically enjoyable, have troubled me with their outright plagiarism.  The well-known random lyric lifts from Confessions of a Yakuza on L&T; \\"Bye and Bye\\" melody from L&T directly lifted from Billie Holiday's \\"Having Myself a Time\\", \\"Sugar Babe\\" from Gene Austin's \\"Lonesome Road\\"- and now the overt \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" from Muddy Waters or Babyface Leroy, and \\"Someday Baby\\" from Lowell Fulsom or Lightnin' Hopkins. Granted maybe those old blues guys didn't write them either, and of course many songs credited to A. P. Carter were obviously collected rather than written by him.  But once they were recorded and someone took credit, that was it.  How can the writing credit be presented on MT and L&T as \\"All songs written by Bob Dylan\\"? Don't the original sources merit at least an asterix?  When the Stones recorded \\"Prodigal Son\\", they credited Rev Harry Wilkins.  Granted Bob changed most of the words, and I like the records (I love Love and Theft the most of all Bob's great records) but I think he owes the world an explanation.  Is it in retaliation for other songwriters robbing his ideas blind?  Does he consider it all part of the folk tradition?  Is there any line that Bob considers crosses into plagiarism? Is raising these questions his whole point?  I still love and respect Bob's work, but what are we to make of the plagiarism?  It puts a shadow across his whole catalog's credibility as original works.   <br /> <br />Other than that, this is another great record in an incredible body of work.  I'd rank it lowest of the \\"trilogy\\" below L&T and TOOM, on a par with Oh Mercy and Under the Red Sky.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Shucks, Bob is, at times, all but a softy on the inaptly titled _Modern Times_.  I love it.  The lyrics are sharp and Bob's vocals are gruff but intelligible.  The songs are a bit softer than I anticipated, no ripping, up tempo ones like, for example, on _Love and Theft_, but the entire effort is certainly genuine.  As a self-proclaimed \\"musical expeditionary,\\" it clearly seems as though Bob hasn't lost his ability to keep us all scratching our heads with respect to his musical direction.  But I suppose that has always been the case and, perhaps, why, in part, we hold Bob in such high regard: he always does--and always has done--exactly what he wants to do.  I suppose for some of us--dare I say most of us--the reality of possessing almost complete control of our direction, vision, mission--or, whatever you want to call it, seems improbable.  So, with that said, go get the CD, enjoy it, and hope that we all get a chance to hear where Bob takes us next time.  For now, like others have said, it's back to listening to Bob's latest gem....

B000BJ7BCA|4.0|When it came out in theatres I thought it looked sucky so whatever. It started showing on TV like 2 months ago and I found out Bruce Campbell was in it so I decided to watch but it turned out to actually be a good movie. Yeah there are cheesy parts but overall it's funny and has good action. And the name \\"Warren Peace\\" alone is brillant.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I don't think this is the best speculative fiction show on, but it shows glimpses of what it can be given enough time.  Hopefully, the WB will stick with it longer than its elder bretheren would (ABC - Already Been Cancelled; NBC - Now Being Cancelled; CBS - Cancelled Before Scheduled; and Fox - which is a near rhyme for...well, you can figure it out.  The chemistry between the two leads is good, and the mythology that many of the ex-X-File-ites are creating could have a long life as the characters dig deeper.  Besides dad, though, I think we need to see more recurring characters.  Surely these three aren't the only hunters out there, so start showing us the bigger picture and stop killing off all the allies.  Don't get me wrong, I'm addicted, but the show has potential that's not really showing up yet.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Words are extraneous in this, one of my favorite Hitchcock flicks.<br /><br />There is an uncannily interwoven drama of the actors' faces, the architectural settong, the music and the rhythmic editing that make this a true masterpiece of the cinematic art.<br /><br />A film to be enjoyed on its own terms, it has also invited two generations of the most demanding intellectual analyses imagineable.
B00005AWMF|4.0|There are 3 female voices in the music industry that I just absolutely love because of their distinctive sound: T-boz from TLC, Stevie Nicks, and Sade. Nobody will ever get these 3 women's voices mixed up with anybody else's.    Sade's voice is so soothing and beautiful. She never oversings. She's never guilty of vocal acrobatics. She stays in her range and her icy sounding voice ironically brings great warmth to her songs.     Buying her Best Of was perfect for me as a casual fan. My 5 favorite songs from the collection are...  1. Sweetest Taboo  2. No Ordinary Love  3. Pearls  4. Jezebel  5. Kiss of Life    Even today, most don't know who Sade is. She's not a household name despite making good music since the 80s. She's a fortyish woman who is satisfied with who she is and where she is and has no need to disrespect herself by stripping down to appeal to young people. She is sexy. But she doesn't TRY to be sexy, which is the fundamental difference between real sexiness and raunchiness. She exudes classiness and sophistication. Maybe Sade could give Janet some advice since Janet seems intent on ruining her legacy and iconic status to compete with women half her age.
B00005JJX8|5.0|This is Hitch's least \\"heady\\" film -- the sheer physical beauty of Grace Kelly in her prime, Cary Grant in his, and the French Mediterranean in its, they all conspire to confound intellectualization. The screen seems slick with the vapors of the stars' physical luminosity.<br /><br />Even the simplest props, like garments, echo this celebration of stylized cinematic glamor and beauty. Grace's whispy gowns and Grant's bespoke casual attire seem to animate the screen with enough energy to be characters themselves! Kelly's eyes hypnotize! Watching Grant slip his hand into his trouser pockets or stride across the street is equally mesmerizing.<br /><br />The tale combines suspense with comedy in a way that is utterly unique in all of Hitchcock's American work. TCAT lacks the gravitas of Notorious, the polished and self-conscious artistry of Spellbound, the metronomic rhythm of Rear Window, the spiraling tension of North by Northwest and the emotional range of Vertigo. But it offers a telling sidelight -- the shimmering splendor of pure sensuous beauty.<br /><br />I suspect that this strain of hedonic delight represents a significant, if somewhat rare, component of Hitchock's ethos.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie did not disappoint me.  Keira Knightley's performance was excellent, along with the entire casts!  The story is old and reliable, and as good as ever.  (Although the ending was a touch cheesey.)  A really great movie, especially for Jane Austen fans!!!  It is about the five Bennet sisters, and their falling in love.  Most dear to your heart being Lizzy, who realizes that you don't always fall in love with the person you might have thought you would and that not everyone is exactly as they seem.  Great story!!!  (IMHO, even though books are usually better than the movies they are made into, this movies was really good.)
B000G75AE8|3.0|A new Slayer album?  Even with the bad cover art I still couldn't pass it up.  I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this one though...  The music is pretty good.  I think the band was trying to mirror Seasons a bit, because a lot of the tracks are similar, but there's enough difference to make me like the riffs, the drums and all the usual Slayer aggression.  The lyrics however, are a different story.    The anti-God and pro-Satan ramblings come accross a bit predictable and just plain juvenile.  They don't even go about it intelligently.  It seems that they are just trying to make their lyrics angry and offensive, which doesn't make them very convincing.    And then there are Araya's vocals, which I don't think hold up like they used to.  He was never a particularly wonderful metal singer, but he held his own and was a refreshing change to a lot of the incomprehensible growling or high pitched falsettos that accompanied a lot of metal frontmen.  But now it seems that he is trying to sing as loud and fast as he can to cover up his lack of range, and this is one of my least favorite parts of the album.      ~~ \\"Flesh Storm\\"  Not every track has bad lyrics, or deals with the God/Satan factor.  The opener, (aka War Ensemble 2, or so it seems) has the usual Slayer \\"war is hell\\" theme to it. It has some nice riffs, nice drumming (what else to expect from Mr. Lombardo?) and is a good opener track.    ~~\\"Catalyst\\"  A good second track.  I haven't paid much attention to the lyrics, but the song is aggressive and fast and sounds generally good.    ~~\\"Skeleton Christ\\"  Dimebag?  Is that you?  The riffs on this song sound like Pantera rather than Slayer, with the slower grind and groove rather than the speed.  This isn't all bad, and it makes for some cool music, but when Araya busts in with his \\"Hail Satan\\" it just gets a little emberassing to listen to.      ~~\\"Eyes of the Insane\\"  This one is okay, but it seems to be following the \\"let's make this CD sound like Seasons in the Abyss\\" theme.  It reminds me of \\"Expendable Youth\\" but not as good.    ~~\\"Jihad\\"  This one is definitely interesting.  The music is different and the theme of the song is pretty cool.  I like this one.    ~~\\"Consfearacy\\"  This one is a good, fast rocker with the usual Slayer aggression.  Nothing too special, but I like it.      ~~\\"Catatonic\\"  This one rocks.  The riffs are slow and dark and menacing like I expect Slayer to be, and Araya's vocals are tollerable.    ~~\\"Black Serenade\\"  Another good one, fast with some good rythyms.    ~~\\"Cult\\"  This could have been the best on the album.  It sounds very much like the title track from Seasons, but I love the buildup and the opening riff after the intro.  Once again though, it's bogged down by the lyrics and vocals and lyrics, trying too hard to be anti-God and scary (I've made my choice, 666)  Come on, give us something more original.    ~~\\"Supremist\\"  This one doesn't really work for me.  The riffs aren't very good and too much of Araya yelling...    Overall, this is an okay outing from Slayer, but I don't think it really had too much to offer over their last couple of CDs.  If you're a Slayer fan, you probably have this anyways, but if you're just starting out, go with Seasons in the Abyss, South of Heaven or Reign in Blood.
B00005JP4W|5.0|Anyone who ever steps outside the front door of his home needs to see this film.  The companion book is a compelling read, too.
6304698690|5.0|What's with all the negative comments? This movie is incredible! And yes, I have read the book; I watched this movie the very same day I finished the book, in fact, and relished both treasures. I stayed up till four am watching the film (in spite of the fact I had school the next day) and it was worth it!<br /><br />The heroine, Mary, is truly a diverse character; in the beginning of the story, she is spoiled and snobbish, cared for by her Indian nursemaids and neglected by her socialite parents. When her parents die in a tragic accident, however, Mary is sent from the exotic heat of India to the coldness of England, where she is again almost totally ignored by her uncle and his busy servants. Left on her own to wonder the grounds as she chooses, Mary soon comes across many secrets that have long lay buried and sets about unearthing them. It is during her endeavors of discovery that she slowly awakens two lush gardens: one within the mansion's grounds, and another deep in her heart.<br /><br />This story is largely about healing and awakening; the spring glory of the secret garden and the touching spiritual healing of Mary and her family are equally heart-jerking and brought tears to my eyes. Many have complained about inaccuracy to the book, but with a few minor exceptions, I must say I disagree. Any changes were small and I personally think Burnett would have been proud of this film. The scenery, casting, and music are flawless; the grounds of Mary's uncle's huge estate go from cold to vibrantly breathtaking in wonderful symbolism. The child who plays Mary is a classicaly lovely brunette who brings the perfect mixture of high-class snobbery, stubborness, and ultimate softness to her character; Maggie Smith is also wonderful in her stiff but not unlikeable role as head housekeeper, and no one could have found a better actor for the thin and isolated Colin. And the music: if I hadn't already lost the battle with tears, I would have as soon as Linda Ronstadt's haunting voice began singing when the credits rolled. The music throughout is wonderful and adds to the story's beauty.<br /><br />This movie is refreshing, healing, and beautiful. I highly recommend it, whether you've read the book or not; unless you're a VERY hardcore fan who will not allow yourself to tolerate any inaccuracies whatsoever, you'll heartily enjoy it.singing when the credits rolled.

0060763280|5.0|In 2003, my mother presented my husband and me with tickets to one of T. Harv Eker's seminars. Having seen many famous top speakers over the past two decades, I was a bit skeptical at first. I thought that perhaps it would be \\"the same old same old\\". But it wasn't.<br /><br />After attending the introductory seminar, my husband and I invested in Harv's MMI or Millionaire Mind Intensive seminar. WOW! Most of what he teaches is in this book. His practical approach and \\"no holds barred\\" attitude are what make his seminars and books so enjoyable. This guy doesn't pull any punches or give you vague information. He tells it like it is and shows you how to do it. His methods and seminars are like no other.<br /><br />We've since attended a few more seminars and have been impressed with each one. Many of our friends and family have read this book, and it has changed many lives. I highly recommend this book and any other by Harv. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is more a `science' and not some get-rich-scheme. The book is brave, blunt and brilliant. Don't let the word \\"millionaire\\" scare you! There is money to be made...and someone has to make it. Why not you? That's Harv's attitude.<br /><br />After attending some of his seminars and his Enlightened Warrior Camp (A-ho!), I found my passion ignited and then discovered the vehicle to get me there. My goal was to become a successful published author. My fourth novel (a reprint of my debut) is due out in 2007! I am slowly but surely getting there. Thanks, Harv!<br /><br />~ Cheryl Kaye Tardif<br />Author of Divine Intervention
B000G759LW|1.0|There is no substance to this wreck. Absolute pap. She should go back to bouncing that sweet body around, chirping stupid, pre-pubescent lyrics and leave serious music to grown-ups. I hope that I can dump this dog as \\"played once\\" and hope it will never again be in my earshot.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I was rather \\"Out of the loop\\" for the duration of Napoleon-Mania . I was serving as a missionary for my church, at which time I didn't watch any TV or movies or even listen to much music. I heard a little bit about Napoleon Dynamite, and alot of people were quoting it(\\"IDIOTS\\"). All I saw was a formula for disaster. Everyone said there was no plot and that there were alot of inside jokes. All of the 10-15 yr old crowd seemed highly entertained while most of their parents did not. So when I got home (which was after the lunacy), I hesitated, even rejected invitations to watch it. Then one day, at Blockbuster, my dad convinced me to watch it. Honestly, I loved it. I laughed for days. That's all that was really important to me.
B00003CXXS|3.0|No movie in this series will ever top the first \\"Jurassic Park\\". That film thrilled audiences with their first glimpse of realistic, inter-acting dinosaurs. That magic feeling, of course, would not last for long, because of the dearth of CGI-enhanced films that followed the film's blazing run in theaters. \\"Jurassic Park 3\\", however, is definately an improvement over the second film in the series,\\"The Lost World\\", for a few good reasons: first, the film is short and to the point. It's basically a thrill ride to the end. Second, the special effects are just that: special. The dinosaurs are jaw-dropping in their appearance, making some inconsistancies with the other films just a bit more palatable. And third, although I enjoyed the rather Godzilla-like T-Rex attack on San Diego, it was really out of place in the second film, and there was nothing like that in this one. It was good to see Sam Neil back, and Laura Dern, also, if only in a small cameo-type role. As I said, while a true sequel, meaning not as good as the original, it's still highly entertaining in a thrill-park way. The picture transfer is great, the sound clear and sharp. There are interesting bonus features to explore, and overall, this is a solid DVD to have.
B0002I831S|5.0|Not only was I surprised at how well written and acted the first season was, but I was also blown away at how vivid and sharp the image looks. TOS was actually filmed and then transferred to video tape, so when they remastered the series, they were able to go back to the film source. As a result, the picture looks nearly as good as any dvd movie. Much better in fact than any of the more recent star trek series which were video taped. One draw back to this is that you can see how cheesy the control panels on the ship are.

All the people from the normal superman universe are there just changed roles to suit the story. highly recommend this for anyone with an interest in superman, you don't have to be a huge comic fan to enjoy this book. only bad thing is i thought it was a bit short, could have added more i thought and thats why it gets 4 instead of 5 outa 5.

0452270073|4.0|Set in the context of WWI(1914-1918)when the war had ground to a gruesome standstill, 'Regeneration', hinges on the compelling character Dr. Rivers, a psychiatrist dedicated to treating the \\"shell-shocked\\" soldiers of the Allied Powers at Craiglockhart War Hospital- a mental facility in Scotland. During Rivers' employment as a practicing pyschiatrist at Craiglockhart, his experiences with the mental patients force Rivers to question the very nature of madness. In particular, one man, Siegfried Sassoon, a decorated soldier sent to the mental facility claiming a \\"breakdown\\" to avoid being court-martialed for protesting the war. As the novel progresses, the lines between madness and reason blurr and Rivers wonders if he himself is mad.  <br />    I highly recommend this book. Pat Barker's novel questions what could possibly justify the destruction of an entire generation's minds and bodies. Perhaps Rivers answers this question himself upon the discovery of Burns's cold emaciated form huddled in a moat, \\"Nothing justifies this.

0525457585|5.0|I read the whole story through in three days taking small breaks. it seems to draw you in like the movie, and never let's you go. I felt when I read it that I was part of the world of Bastian Balthazar Bux, Atreyu and The Neverending Story, and had become a part of it myself. You would see what I mean if you have a good imagination. It's full of mysticality, magic and intrigue, and stuff that blows your mind at trying to visualize it because it's so peculiar and imaginative. When Bastian steals the book The Neverending Story from Coreander's Book store, he feels he is drawn to the book by some force-one which he is subtly aware of. This force is apparently a guiding beacon, for the book is a portal to Fantastica. The book describes parts of Bastians life though, which really amazes Bastian. Fantastica is a realm that actually has a reality all it's own, and some of the inhabitants, including it's ruler The Empress-know about earthlings. Pretty mind boggling to begin to describe. If you love books that are full of imaginitave and original concepts, this book is for you. The Neverending Story to me is a fantasy world that symbolizes all that inspiration, creativity and imagination can create through love. It's a MUST READ.
B000GRTQSE|3.0|Frankly to me it is quite a deception, especially compared with time out of mind and even love and theft. Well I have listened to it twice when coming back home from work and I plan not to listen to it tonight.

It is much less innovative than \\"can't wait\\" and \\"cold irons bound\\" from time out of mind
B000GRTQSE|4.0|Modern Times is a very good Bob Dylan record that fits nicely into the current \\"Social Security Renaissance\\" phase of his career. The record company and lots of critics have been calling it part three of a trilogy that began with Time Out of Mind and continued with Love And Theft but I would suggest that the latter two enjoy a much closer connection with Good As I Been To You and World Gone Wrong, his early '90's revisit of the folk songs that lit his fire in the first place. I guess this theory makes Modern Times the last block in a quad.<br /><br />Time Out Of Mind shares with its two subsequent neighbors in the Dylan discography a return to exquisite song craft, stunning lyrics and passionate musicianship that were sorely lacking from the hit and miss affairs of the eighties. However, the atmospheric production and small army of master musicians playing on it tie it much more closely to the other Daniel Lanois produced highlight of the catalog, 1989's Oh Mercy.<br /><br />When the back to back folk-cover releases, Good As I Been To You and World Gone Wrong dropped in the early 90's after the uninspired Under The Red Sky, it looked like a retrenchment for an artist who had run out of inspiration. Who knew that by revisiting his roots, he would re-ignite a blast of inspired creativity that continues to inform and inspire his work to this day?<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, Modern Times is very much Love and Theft Part II, which is no bad thing. Both records draw on traditional folk and blues melodic and thematic forms but emerge as a Dylanized hybrid that sits comfortably beside his best work.<br /><br />In addition to the invigorated songwriting and the no-frills Jack Fate production a major key to the success of these two albums is that they were recorded by Dylan's Never Ending Tour band. Instead of his usual method of hiring a band of studio aces supported by superstar guest appearances, the guys playing on these records are the same cohesive unit blazing away with him night after night in arenas, theaters and baseball parks. This provides a sympathetic foundation that he has not enjoyed since his collaborations with The Band. Ironically, as the Never Ending Tour band continues to evolve, bassist and musical director Tony Garnier is the only link between the two groups that made these records.<br /><br />Like Love and Theft, the songs on Modern Times are a mix of familiar song forms. There are roots-rockin' / bluesy rockers Thunder on the Mountain, Rollin' and Tumblin', Someday Baby and The Levee's Gonna Break. Old Timey Waltzes Spirit On The Water and Beyond the Horizon as well as a straight ballad, When the Deal goes Down. There are also tunes that I think of as Dylan-esque (for lack of a better term) and these are probably my favorites: Ain't Talkin', Nettie Moore and Workingmans Blues #2. In Fact, Ain't Talkin' may be the knockout Dylan classic of the whole album.<br /><br />Although quite good, Modern Times is a little softer, a little less rockin' that Love and Theft and I wonder if this is not partly due to the absence of Charlie Sexton. Charlie Sexton is such a consummate rocker and I think his much lamented departure from the touring band spills over into the studio. The rockers on Modern Times are good but never quite achieve lift off. Watch the Cold Iron Bounds video presented here for a taste of the rock bite this band was unable to provide.<br /><br />Finally one minor complaint: The record company is charging quite a bit extra for this deluxe edition, and I think it would have been very appropriate to load the bonus DVD up with more than four videos. High on my personal wish list is a complete version of the smokin' Drifter's Escape from the Masked and Anonymous movie.blazing away with him night after night in arenas, theaters and baseball parks.

B00005JP5J|5.0|If you've ever been on one of those family vacations where everything that can go wrong, goes wrong, then moments of Little Miss Sunshine will resonate with you. The finest part of the film was the casting, and the ability of the director to draw out an excellent ensemble synergy. No one person in the cast stands out, and all slip right into the skin of their personal dysfunctional character like hand in glove.<br /><br />The nuclear family in the story, of Albuquerque, is headed by Kinnear as Richard, the developer of a \\"self-help\\" routine that he's trying to sell, wife Sheryl (Collette), stepson Dwayne (Paul Dano, brilliantly cast as a misfit teen, a devotee of the combination of Nietzche and the Air Force) and young 7 year old Olive (Abigail Breslin), who has not yet been touched by the pessimistic air of the family, and who is the vital force that keeps them all moving forward. Breslin is perhaps the finest part of the film (she has appeared before, in \\"Signs\\").<br /><br />For the \\"road trip\\" on which the film centers, the family is trying to get Olive to Redondo Beach, CA for a young girl's pageant know as Little Miss Sunshine. It's not clear why Olive is fixated on the pageant, but the family pulls out all the stops to go. In doing so, they can't leave behind their houseguests, Richard's father (Alan Arkin as Grandpa) who was thrown out of assisted living for shooting heroin, and Sheryl's brother Frank (Carrell), who has recently lost his tenured position, his lover and has tried to commit suicide. This is not a laugh out loud role for Carrell, and it's excellent to see the bittersweet side of him.<br /><br />Along the trip, there are many challenges that would have sent a family less devoted to their daughter back home again...there's a great scene with ice cream in a diner...but nothing tops the family's reaction when they get to the pageant. Given the recent developments in the JonBenet case, and the endless fascination the public has with those shots of JonBenet in her \\"glam\\" pageants, the bizarre competition that Olive faces in the person of many little girls aged well beyond their youth is startling.<br /><br />Olive's been working on the talent portion of the competition with her grandfather, and her talent is completely inappropriate and hilarious. The support she receives from her family, however, shows that even the most dysfunctional families can pull together in a crisis, and grow from it.<br /><br />Without giving away any more of the film, I'll tell you that you will find \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" metaphorical and sweet at some turns, laugh out loud at others. What more can you ask from a comedy?hose shots of JonBenet in her \\"glam\\" pageants, the bizarre competition that Olive faces in the person of many little girls aged well beyond their youth is startling.  <br /> <br />Olive's been working on the talent portion of the competition with her grandfather, and her talent is completely inappropriate and hilarious.

B000GFLAI0|1.0|This is the worst music that I have heard in a long time. It's time for Dylan to retire. Dylan, along with Sonny Bono could never sing. The only reason Dylan got a recording contract back in the 60's was that there was a hippie movement that accepted just about anything with the thinking that anything goes. Although he had a few good ones back then that he managed to make sound good, the truth is he couldn't sing back then and he certainly can't now. He couldn't hit a high note or a low note because he just never had the lung capacity to carry a tune. With this album, his voice is so weak, he is just kind of talking to music. Ah, the times they are a changing.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This is with no doubt, one of the Creepiest , complex and weirdest movies of all the times, Christian Bale's acting is superb,impresive. It'll get you hooked on your chair,it's a travel through the human mind's fears and guilts,this movie is intriguing, disturbing to watch,but in fact is one of the best Psycological thrillers in the history of movie making<br /><br />Excellent!!!
B00003CX8N|3.0|Unfortunately I was expecting the BBC version of this - though this is my fault for not looking at the deatils carefully enough. This is an american version of the BBC production and falls far short of the feeling created by the original. <br /> <br />  The DVD delivery & service were great - would buy stuff from these folk again - no problem there
B00005MP58|5.0|.... there is still a good chance you will fall in love with this Pride & Prejudice heart and soul. It has charme, wit, humor and a superb cast, and even the oddities and irksomenessess retain a sense of true wonderfulness.
0684824906|3.0|Ms. Goodwin has done a great deal of research in writing this book,  you can tell because the footnotes stretch for over 100 pages.  The problem is that she seems to want to share all of it with us. <br /> <br />Too much of this book covers aspects that have no real conection to the interaction of Lincoln with his cabinet.  Do we really need to know the spending habits of Mary when they never seemed to have an inpact on her husband? <br /> <br />If you don't mind spending some time on irrelevant details, such as what the daughters where to their fathers' parties the book does give a great perspective on Lincoln.
B000GFLAI0|2.0|I'll agree that Bob Dylan has never had an amazing singing voice, and if anything it has gotten worse over the years. But what Dylan did have was a knowledge of music that no one could contest, originality, and pure substance.  Dylan's music was HIS music.  It had meaning, color, emotions that were vivid and beautifully expressed and, singing voice or not, no one could sing his songs with the same feeling that he could. <br />Everything that Bob Dylan was is lacking in this album.  The style that was his own has been replaced with traditional Louisiana corner blues, and the meaningful lyrics that always struck the hearts of his fans have been replaced with cliche's and emotions that don't seem to belong to him.  For these reasons, this album was disappointing to me and will never mean as much to me as his past albums or as Ray Charles' or Beethoven's works have meant to me.
B000001FRY|5.0|Simply, their best.  If you truly enjoy U2, this is it, before all the hype.  If you want mainstream, buy something else.  This is one of my most favorite albums ever.
B0009X7664|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is certainly destined to be a classic of both American literature and American film-making, if it is not already. I would like to first discuss the novel from which the film was adapted. Then I will discuss the award winning film which can be obtained on DVD. Finally I will discuss the continued question about this work, which is whether it is a book for children or adults. <br /> <br />Harper Lee's novel continues to stimulate debate. Whereas the debate was about morality and racial relationships when the novel was written, the debate of late is centered on whether Harper Lee wrote a book for adults written through the eyes of a child or whether her intention was to write a book for children/young adults. I know I read the book when I was in the eighth grade and found it to be wonderful.But maybe it was fantastic because I was 14 years old and the moral clarity and wise heroism of Atticus Finch seems very right to my adolescent sense of justice. The re-claiming of Bo Radley back into the world of the living also gives a message about rejection, acceptance, reclaiming the lost, and affection. The novel is full of wonderful experience and moral commentary as presented through the eyes of a 7 year old tom-boy, a technique Mark Twain used in many of his novels. Twain recommended this style in fact pointing out that the hypocracy and odd motives of adults can be commented upon through nieve eyes with a sense of wonder and delightful humor.  <br /> <br />The film, which captures poor rural Alabama perfectly, also was fantastic. Gegory Peck was outstanding, as were all the actors. The screen play is penetrating and tight, never letting the characters become cute country hicks. The black and white format with austere depression era sets compliments the actions, turning a residential street in a poor Alabama town into a microcosm of the world of good, bad, and misunderstood forces. <br /> <br />But is it for children or adults?  Flannery O'Connor, thegreat writer, said that it amazed her that most adult readers didn't realize it was a children's book. This debate is re-introduced in the recent film \\"Capote\\" where a New York literary character asks Nelle Harper Lee at a cocktail party about the 'children's book' she had written and published. After a recent reviewing of the book and film, I find that the work actually has vast appeal to children, young adults, and adults. I don't mean this to be avoidance of answering the question, but the work has multiple levels of depth and moral instruction relevant to any age. The criticism that it is a children's book is usually based on the lack of moral ambiguity in the strong forceful wise character of Atticus Finch. However, he is surrounded by adults with quivering morality, including the county sherrif and a town full of persuadable white establishment. It may in fact be very realistic to portray a character with clear moral bearings such as Atticus Finch, since such persons do in fact live in reality and I have been lucky enough in my life to know many such fine persons and I personally aspire to such moral character and strength. I don't think this makes me childlike for I recognize character is long in developing,often tested, and always remains an unfinished work of art within us.  This is the appeal of the adult reader/viewer for this classic work of American literature and film-making for in the end it calls upon all of us, child or adult, to aspire to our own strength of character and courage for the sake of justice.
B00008977N|5.0|This DVD is a compilation of some of Peter Gabriel's best music, and true to form, he backs this one up with a well designed stage show.  It has some nice effects and really adds to the overall experience without being over the top.  He is also joined by Paula Cole who has a great voice.  She blends well with the rest of the group, but the thing I enjoyed most was that they all seemed to be having a great time.  Great music and a lot of fun!  A great addition to any music/DVD collection!
B000002H70|5.0|Why write another review of this album?  Is it proper even to use the word \\"review\\" in this context?  One of the best things Roger Ebert ever said was that Prospero's Books (Greenaway) \\"stands above criticism\\".  I feel the same way about Disintegration.  It's difficult to believe that Robert Smith really wrote this, easier to imagine that Mozart-like this music always was and he just scribbled it out.<br /><br />Not true of course, this music obviously came from the depth of a human soul, and Smith has more than proven his genius.  What amazes me is how few people understand what a miracle the Cure is, how long the love between the fans and this band (well, Bob and Simon anyway) has gone on.  No other artist I am aware of has produced great music in four decades.  Oh sure, there are singers with that kind of longevity, but writing, performing, engineering and producing, plus touring behind it all?  Maybe Neil Young?  At least he still writes.  Oldsters that perform with 86-piece backing bands are disqualified, so that leaves out Bruce, the Stones, etc.  Otherwise, forget it, unless there's some country western artist I'm ignorant about, Smith has no competition.  So if there are only 283 reviews posted here, why not?  Maybe Cure fans shouldn't be so shy in talking about the holy grail, then there'd be tens of thousands and they'd need a new server to hold them all.<br /><br />Now, let's defend that title, the best album ever.  I don't need to preach to the converted and mention that every song on this album is a solid, A-class song do I?  Anything weak at all?  \\"Closedown\\" could be criticized as being less than an independent song due to the paucity of lyrical content, but it's a wonderful piece of music in context.  My least favorite song might be \\"Disintegration\\", just due to the shattering noise it makes in disgorging Bob's relationship guilt, but I'm being silly aren't I?  Great song.  My favorite is \\"Last Dance\\", which oddly enough wasn't on the vinyl, though thank goodness Smith recognizes it, and included it on Trilogy, or I'd die.<br /><br />But I digress.  Let's look at the other contenders.  The White Album?  No way, a good 50% of that album is [...], I don't care what Paul says.  And some of the rest are novelty songs that don't really make for serious listening.  The Doors?  Worthy indeed, but do you really like \\"Whiskey Song\\"?  I hate it myself,  and the album is not a complete effort, despite the overall greatness that cannot be denied.  Let's defer to Rolling Stone and pass right over Sgt. Pepper's, some of which is not even listenable, be honest!  Pet Sounds?  Very dated, not a uniform effort by any means.  Revolver?  Great songs, but there is a lot of filler on that album, unless you can whistle \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" for me . . . right now.  It's the same for the rest of the top ten, which includes Exile on Main Street, a album loaded with undistinguished blues stuff, even Stones fans will admit.  Quick, name one song on that album other than \\"Tumbling Dice\\".  I'm waiting.  Rumours?  No, about a 50% great effort, several songs to the scrap bin.<br /><br />You can argue about impact, history, influence, sure.  In that context maybe Elvis did have the #11 album of all time, and Sgt. Pepper is #1 (I guess).  But just as a piece of music, start to finish, what really compares to this?  Damn little.  If great men stand on the shoulders of others, maybe in that context Disintegration is the result of integrating all those prior great albums.  But it stands on top regardless.

B00023B1LC|5.0|A great movie. The appetizer for the superb Bourne Supremacy that follows... great action and THE best fight scenes...no contest. None of the cliché \\"Matrix\\" multi camera stuff, or the blue screen fly by wire special effects. Just straight up lightning fast, adrenaline pumping speed. The camera work is perfect, with quick 3 second scene changes that make the action even more intense. A definite must buy for any fan of conspiracy-action movies. One of the best.
B000EYK4KI|2.0|this movie is so bad that i simply couldn't finish it. why this movie would be remade to renew the old 'prizzi's honor' is beyond my wits. this movie was just dumb and childish. totally ridiculous and shallow.
B000G759LW|4.0|Its not a perfect album. She does over-sing at times. Some of the tracks are self important. Some of the tracks dont sound as if they belong. But there are too many great things about the album to ignore. <br /> <br /> <br />-She has one of the best, if not the best voices of her generation. Many of the artists at the top of the charts today cant actually sing for crap. <br /> <br />-She is passionate about her music, lyrics, concept- the album is a direct reflection of her personal life and state of mind at 25- like Stripped was her at 21. I really believe she is in this business for the MUSIC more than any other reason- while it seems like too many artists these days are in it for the fame (ie all the actors/other celebrities who put out albums). Much of the music of the last few years sound like the artists do not truly CARE about making quality music. If you want to call yourself an artist or a musician- develop and put forth effort in the music. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Stripped was great and so is this album. It has live music and beat driven music, good lyrics, fun songs and serious songs, old sound and modern sound- all with a great vocal range. I just appreciate any artist that has a great voice, writes meaningful lyrics, uses live music and is passionate about the reason they are rich and famous- the music.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I never would have listened to this album if a friend hadn't forced me to. An english version of a Russian pop sensation? I just didn't see the appeal. And yet once I began listening, I just couldn't stop. Yes, the lyrics are repetitive, but somehow these girls just pull you in.  <br /> <br />Be prepared, you'll find yourself singing these songs under your breath everywhere you go. And when someone asks you what you're doing, turn them on to this incredible music.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|This is the must own live Dream Theater experience. The performance is flawless and you will be surprised how awesome the set list works, considering how odd it sounds. <br /> <br />Be certain to watch the concert IN ITS ENTIRETY. I don't believe that Metropolis will have the same effect if you don't, and trust me, you're going to want the full experience from Metropolis :)
B00079FUI6|5.0|The complete first season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is in a word.. \\"Astonishing\\" with a capital A!! Face it.. weather you like it or not its purpose is meant for entertainment value. The fact that it's won awards is just a bonus. I just got the second season on dvd and before I began watching it I decided I wanted to watch the last episode of season 1 again first.. I've watched the full course of season 1 twice already on dvd and once when it originally aired on ABC. I remember the weeks going by slow while waiting to find out what madness would take place on Wisteria Lane next. The show is full of rich humor that is sometimes dark. It's mystery has you begging for answers no matter how off the wall the situation might be. The force of sexual nature is present in every episode.. the women and men are mostly beautiful but, lets face it, it works that way! I mean who would care to have a visual of say Rosie O'Donnel falling naked in a bush? Right we'd much rather see Teri Hatcher in that situation! And I think we'd all rather see Nicolette Sheridan squeeze a soapy sponge between her cleavage while washing her sports car than say Whoopi Goldberg. As for the female fans ..im sure they didnt mind Jesse Metcalf mowing Eva Longoria's lawn shirtless over someone like Frankie Muniz (God love Malcolm in the Middle). My point is if you are among those that question why the cast is majority attractive. Remember this is a television show thats sole purpose is to entertain its veiwers. Honestly I'd rather watch gorgeous people for an hour over a bunch of plain Jane's and average Joe's. Some veiwers also question why so many bad things can happen in one neighborhood.. the answer again is simple. DH is for entertainment ..which it provides with benefits!! I love this show and, I am desperate for more! The season 1 dvd set includes: All 23 episode for season 1, unrated/extended episodes, behind the scenes featurettes, commentaries with Marc Cherry and cast and, a special mini episode with Oprah. All this plus more!! Buy it today!e with Oprah. All this plus more!! Buy it today!
0440539811|5.0|I had to write a review because it will be the 235th, and that chance should not be wasted. <br /> <br />A friend handed me a copy of this book that he found in a used bookstore, and it's sent me on years of reading and thinking that I would have otherwise missed.  <br /> <br />If you haven't read it yet, give it time as you start. The beginning put me off at first, but that style of prose eventually becomes more accessible. <br /> <br />This is a book that is simply important for you to read, even if you don't agree with it or even like it. Just as Joe Malik becomes \\"at one with Middle America\\" in Schrodinger's Cat, try to shift your reality so that it becomes at least tolerable. <br /> <br />In the end, that's what RAW does: he makes you doubt and rethink reality. The thing is, he doesn't believe any of it. As long as you don't seriously begin to wonder about Harry Coin and all the 23s you see (and you WILL see them), it's a great trip.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Bob Dylan continues his late Renaissance with his newest effort 'Modern Times'.  It is another remarkable, but slightly uneven, representative in his long stretch of late career classics.  He and his very able band deliver a wonderful blues repertoire.  His voice is aging, just like everything delivered since at least 'Oh, Mercy'.  If you've never loved his voice, you won't like it here.  (Then, again, if you didn't at least tolerate his voice, you wouldn't have bothered to tumble into this review.)  But, if you've never disliked the gruffness (except when he falters or becomes lackadaisical--on other projects), it should remind you of Leon Redbone.  And how appropriately it fits into this fine album!  (\\"It is the Ragtime of the season,\\" he sings, afterall.)  The production and sound give one the impression we are at a night club enjoying dinner with Dylan and his band entertaining us and our dates.  The intimacy is accentuated by, again--it can't be said enough--by his very excellent band, whose support is heard by the crystal clear production of very able producer, Jack Frost.  The jazz/blues-for-a-nightclub act is never formula, and becomes more ecclectic with other marvelous songs, like the rollicking vintage country of \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\".      Seldom do the songs clock in less than five minutes.  Sometimes the timing is a mixed blessing:  The glorious opening, \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" is worth every precious second that goes over five minutes, but \\"Nettie Moore\\" and the finale \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" are worthy, but long-winded.  At least lyrically, he arrives at his destinations sooner.  His celebrated lyrics are good to great throughout.  He's enjoyed being more spare and direct with words in his maturity (less overflowing and surreal, like his early years).  However, there is much he has retained:  He can still meld political and existential images even in his love songs.  Most of the songs are loving engagements, but he mixes imagery of sin, redemption, and chaos as well.     Specifically, \\"Workingman's Blues\\" delivers Dylan's concrete words in a fluid fashion.  It is a ripplingly beautiful classic.  As typical with Dylan's best work, every song is mesmerizing.  \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" is a fabulous piece of rhythm and blues.  Significantly, to match the song and music, the album--if not recorded like 'Oh, Mercy' in New Orleans--at least absorbs its spirit.  And, here, Dylan's worthy gift is delivered to the stores on the one-year anniversary of Katrina's wake.  \\"Someday Baby\\" and \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" are hypnotic and beautiful, certainly enough to make this C.D. 'The Tempest' for \\"The Bard of Hibbing\\".    Aging baby-boomers and fans of all ages can't help to be enthralled by the latest work by what 'Rolling Stone' magazine called \\"The Big Three\\".  Paul McCartney [of the Beatles] gave us 'Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard,' one of his very best solo albums.  The 'Stones recently delivered 'A Bigger Bang,' their best in years.  Now Dylan finds great support and assembles 'Modern Times'.  The only difference is that 'Love and Theft' and 'Time Out of Mind' demonstrate that Dylan has been on a hot streak for a while.  This album brings no comparisons.  Some of the elements of 'Oh, Mercy' and 'Under a Red Sky' come to mind.  Lyrically, it often matches the former; musically it scotches both.  Vive the Dylan Renaissance! (4 1/2*'s)     *Singular or plural, depending if you count it as the C.D. title or the phrasing.
B00000DFSK|3.0|Not bad, but not their best. compilations can be pretty bad and this one ??????????
0060899190|5.0|I was first attracted to the cover of the book, not ever hearing of Post Secret before. As soon as I opened it, I couldnt put it down. It was in the back of my mind all day, I couldnt stop thinking about it. It gave me a different outlook on life and what other people's lives are like. Definitely something unique, touching and inspiring...5 stars!
1400079179|5.0|Well there's not much I can say that probably hasn't already been said about this book.<br /><br />I've never been much of a fictional historical religious buff but much of its based on fact even though there is a bit of controversy surrounding this book.  It flows well and its a book you'll probably have a hard time putting down like I did.<br /><br />There a few rare books out there that are so powerful and interesting that it gives you either a whole new outlook on life or a new hobby.  After reading this book I was lot more interested in religious works and biblical history in general.  To me that's a sign of an amazing book.<br /><br />While there are some people who may be offended by some of the things said in this book, its in the fictional section for a reason and I think it needs to be treated as such.  This isn't a true account although there are some true historically accurate points.  If you read the book and take in that account, then I think it will be a lot less offending and a lot more enjoyable.<br /><br />Either way I enjoyed this book immensely.
B000EJ9N6Y|5.0|This new Nouvelle Vague CD, Bande a Part, is ridiculously good. So far I'm only on track 4, and all I have to say is HOLY MOLY this is a yummy CD!! They cover \\"new wave/alternative/post punk\\" songs from the 80s--Bauhaus, Echo and the Bunnymen, Buzzcocks, Blondie, Billy Idol, New Order with a twist: set to a Latin rhythm for the most part. (I had never heard of this band until a few weeks ago, and apparently they have three CDs out now.  Whoops!) <br /> <br />Heard \\"Heart of Glass\\" oiginally and thought to myself, \\"clever.\\"  I then heard \\"The Killing Moon\\" and loved it. I also liked \\"Fade to Grey\\" a lot but I have totally fallen in love with \\"Don't Go.\\" Once I listen to that a couple hundred times, I'll move on to \\"Dancing with Myself!\\"  <br /> <br />Now, aside from Billy Idol, Blondie and U2, I haven't heard much of the other groups, though I know that they were huge back in the 80s (sorry, as a teen in suburbs of NJ, I grew up solely on top twenty pop, unfortunately, until I went to college). I religiously watched John Hughes movies, so I had a passing acquaintance with the artists who created this music. And I owned the \\"Pretty in Pink\\" soundtrack, so I knew who the Psychedelic Furs and Echo and the Bunnymen were. I also knew some New Order stuff.  <br /> <br />I worked with a cool girl who was a huge fan of Bauhaus and I hung out with her a bit and listened to a lot of their stuff. She also introduced me to Ska (Philly style), and I started hanging out at a post-punk/alternative club seconds before the Seattle grunge scene hit. <br /> <br />I'm saying all of this to say that I haven't been COMPLETELY ignorant of alternative music of the late 70s and 80s!! What this CD is saying to me is taking a piece of music and changing it to suit a different style with brilliant results shows you the quality of the song to begin with. <br /> <br />Now I'm going to have to go back and pick up some of this stuff in its original form. <br /> <br />If you're sick of listening tochicks sing about how hot they are and how much hotter they are than the other girls, and dudes rapping and singing about how they're going to have sex with you six different ways from Sunday, pick up this CD. Seriously.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I am hard to impress musically, If you like PF, Porc. Tree, Neil Young, and amassed amounts of Prog and/or rock, this must be in your collection. Before its placed amoung your cd's, it will first live on your player. It's really worth it. Commercial to a point, but then again, it's hooks are not of the radio material type. I might even name my next pet after it. Yoshimi
B000002G23|5.0|This complete recordings of the police are the best!  I'm a big fan of The Police!  I like all of their songs!  Which I also bought the Best Of The Police too!  I will give this a 100.0 stars!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|(NOTE: When I first wrote this review shortly after the CD was released, somehow I screwed up and rated it two stars. Reading the review, you can tell that wasn't my intent. Here is the original review with the proper rating.)<br /><br />Paste magazine recently named Bob Dylan as the #1 living songwriter in popular music. Bob belongs at #1 of the greatest songwriters of all time with the release of Modern Times that caps an outstanding trilogy alongside Time Out Of Mind and \\"Love and Theft\\".<br /><br />Modern Times mines the blues more than the previous two releases. Bob does takes on Muddy Water's Rollin' and Tumblin' and Trouble No More, and Memphis Minnie's When The Levee Breaks. The latter appears as The Levee's Gonna Break, a timely song of the flooding of New Orleans. Here Bob follows a long-time blues and folk tradition of taking a song, adding new lyrics, and making it his own as well as fit for the times.<br /><br />Lyrically, the songs are the most spiritual of the trilogy. Themes of sin and redemption, peppered with Scriptural references, are proof only that Bob has always been a person of the spirit, or the Spirit, as you may choose. It's no surprise really that Bob once whole-heartedly embraced Christianity. He has always explored the interactions between the spiritual and material worlds, and he does so here effortlessly.<br /><br />Bob has been able to make such great music at this late stage in his long and storied career because the heat is off. There are no expectations to fulfill, causes to lead, or sales marks to reach. He is no one's messiah. As he sings here, \\"I'm in a cowboy band.\\" Ride on, Bob.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|This movie sucked. It did nothing to enhance the story line of 7. It had no purpose to be made other than to make money. No character developement, no engaging plot, no feeling at all. It was all replaced by the most ridiculous action scenes I have ever seen. Seriously think to yourself, could you picture any of that crap ever happening in the game? I sure couldn't. If they really cared about the game and wanted to do it justice, they wouldn't have waited ten years later and all the sudden try to shove 30 side stories down our throat that have reason to be made. All they wanted to do was show us they can make pretty graphics. They obviously hold nothing sacred anymore. I bet they're laughing at us all for throwing our money at them just because of a simple name and number being attatched to something. I don't consider any of this new stuff part of 7 in my book. It ended with the game for me. They should have kept milking 10, it was crap anyway. I just hope they leave 8 and 9 alone.
0375831002|5.0|I picked this one right up off the shelf at the bookstore. I cannot say exactly what it was that drew me to the book, maybe it was the cover art. I had not heard anything about it so all I had to go on was the synopsis provided on the inside flap(s) of the book. <br /> <br />I have a strange relationship with books that is shared by many readers. There is comfort, nay, magic in not just the words on the pages, but also the smell of the ink and feel of the binding. I wanted to read a story about a young girl who had this same relationship, but in a different time and place. Her circumstances were obviously much more extreme than my mundane life in Suburbia, but I think you will realize that I was not trying to make an apples to apples comparison.  <br /> <br />A book written about a young girl will probably have the feel of a book intended for a young-adult audience most of the time. The Book Thief was so centered around the intimate details of the young girl's life that I was not at all surprised that the writing often took form of fiction intended for young adults. I was not surprised, but I was disappointed. A story set in and written about Nazi Germany with as much detail as The Book Thief provided, I would figure to be over the heads of a young-adult audience. There were so many times that the reading would lapse into the young-adult and it would be harsh language or a particularly grown-up, profound concept that would convince me the book is actually adult fiction.  <br /> <br />The book is, in fact, listed for young adults. As described above, this comes as no surprise from the writing, but does from the subject matter. I think a young adult could enjoy the book, but he/she would simply not realize there is much more depth contained within the pages. I know I am generalizing, but I don't think the majority of younger readers would fully appreciate the book.  <br /> <br />If a few harsh words mean you won't let your kid read it, so be it. If a few sections geared a little too heavily towards a younger audience will prevent you from reading it, so be it as well. If you can get over those hurdles, I do recommend this book to everyone. The book was beautifully compassionate. It dealt with interpersonal relationships under such incredible circumstances and shapes the story through a completely fascinating set of eyes.  <br /> <br />I have no idea how the author came up with the idea to write a story with Death as the narrator, but my hat is off to him for what I consider a 100% success in doing so.  <br /> <br />The book really ended up being all I could hope for. It was the young-adult crutch that keeps The Book Thief from being a great book, but it was certainly worth the read.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|After solving her best friend's murder at the end of season 1, Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) swore off detective work.  She was going to relax and enjoy her senior year.  In fact, she's got a boring job serving coffee.  Just your typical high schooler.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just when she thinks she's out, she's pulled back in.  Firstly, on again off again friend Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is accused of killing a PCHer.  Then best friend Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is part of the group of starting athletes accused of steroid use.<br /><br />But worst of all is the bus crash.  After a routine field trip, the bus the kids were riding in plunges over the side of a cliff, killing all on board.  The rich kids had gotten off, so once again social status plays an issue.  But worse yet, Veronica thinks it was intended to kill her.  Was she the target or was there another sinister purpose?<br /><br />This show started off with a strong first season and only improved with this one.  The writing is as sharp as ever.  Not only did the season long storylines keep me guessing from start to finish, but the individual mysteries that only last one episode were full of twists and turns as well.  In addition to the great plotting, the dialog is fast moving.  Veronica's sarcasm, both in dialog and her voice over narration consistently cracks me up every week.<br /><br />Building on the great writing is equally strong acting.  All of the actors take the wonderful words they are given and nail it every week.  Kristen Bell receives lots of praise for her work here, and it is well deserved.  She consistently hits all the peaks and valleys the role demands, and makes it look effortless.  Equally praise worthy is Enrico Colantoni in his role as Veronica's Dad.  Their scenes together are the heart of the show, and I love watching the two of them together.<br /><br />While the first season set contained little in the way of extras, this one does include some.  There are 22 minutes of deleted scenes, a gag reel, and two behind the scenes featurettes.  All this is on top of wide screen picture and surround sound.  If you are a fan of this show, this set is not to be missed.<br /><br />And if you aren't a fan of this show, what's wrong with you?  There's still time to get up to date on a great show and be ready to start season three when it premiers in a few weeks.of deleted scenes, a gag reel, and two behind the scenes featurettes.

1559409002|5.0|Some brilliant directors only make a few movies. Herk Harvey made over four hundred -- but sadly, he only brought his astounding talents into one non-educational movie.<br /><br />That one brilliant movie is cult horror flick \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" a nightmarish tale of a young woman who is lingering on in the world of the living -- and is pursued by the dead. Made for a piddling seventeen thousand dollars, this little gem is as eerie now as it was in the 1960s.<br /><br />Three young women decide to drag race a car of young men -- and their car goes off a bridge into the river. Only Mary (Candace Hilligoss) staggers out of the water, seemingly undisturbed by the accident. The next day she travels to Utah for her new job as a church organist, but on the trip she keeps seeing a grinning, corpselike man watching her from the road.<br /><br />Mary tries to distract herself with shopping, dodging her lecherous neighbor, and playing the organ. But she keeps seeing the corpse-man), having strange moments where nobody can see or ear her, and also finds herself drawn to a run-down former carnival pavilion. As the dead close in on her, Mary runs from them... but she can't escape from them forever.<br /><br />A simple plot, but Herk Harvey handles it with brilliant skill. There's a goofy moment here or there -- at one point Mary turns around to shriek into the camera lens. But most of the time, Harvey keeps the atmosphere piling on, with relatively little dialogue (the most memorable lines are usually shrieked ones like \\"I don't want to be alone!\\").<br /><br />In short, Harvey had the ability to inspire something a lot rarer than fear or shocks -- dread. Mary's confusion, fear and denial are almost palpable as she wanders through the town. By the climax, it has transformed into a sort of nightmarish maze that Mary can just run through, with the dead people just a few steps behind her. And there's that creepy organ music all the time.<br /><br />The ending is not so much a twist as the inevitable answer to all the bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending. It was also the ending that has inspired creepy horror movies ever since. Suddenly the \\"invisibility\\" moments and the dead faces make perfect sense, and we understand what it is that Mary is really running from.<br /><br />Mary is also not your typical early-sixties heroine -- she's sharp-tongued (\\"Thank you, but I'm NEVER coming back here\\") and kind of spinsterish by nature. What's more, she is completely detached from everyone around her, since she is not meant to be in the world of the living. Hilligoss (who only made one other movie) is absolutely amazing here, with her distant attitude and frightened eyes.<br /><br />If you're willing to shell out for it, the Criterion version of \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is the one to get, especially since it includes both versions of the movie, nicely restored (if you don't have much money, try Alpha). When it first came out, five minutes were chopped off, and here the second disc contains those five extra minutes, reinserted. Nothing groundbreaking, but these little moments of utter creepiness add to the atmosphere.<br /><br />Additionally, Criterion loads it up on fan-friendly extras -- galleries, interviews, company stills, tours of the Kansas town where it was shot, and other little goodies. The documentaries about the making of the film and its history are the highlight of the extra material, and this is mainly for the diehard fan.<br /><br />Brilliant and creepy, \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is a deserving cult classic.

B000FWHVKA|4.0|This Swedish electropp dup is still pretty low-profile, though the Knife seem to be following in the footsteps of Broadcast -- eerie, atmospheric, pretty pop music. Third album \\"Silent Shout\\" returns to the band's root sounds, after the harder techno of their last album, and it's a breath of electronic fresh air.<br /><br />It opens with the blippy, spacey beats of the title track, which shimmers all over the place over some heavy grounding beats. A chorus of voices murmur, like a choir of robots. It's a great intro, and it's a big contrast to the song that comes after it -- the ominous, stomping techno of \\"Neverland.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the album is an attempt to reconcile the two previous sounds the band has had -- hard techno, and airy electropop. After \\"Neverland,\\" there are a couple straightforward techno songs that sound like a spacier Autechre, including the robotic \\"Like A Pen\\" and the schizophrenic space bleeps of \\"We Share Our Mothers' Health.\\"<br /><br />But the majority of these songs are softer and stranger. The Knife dips into spacey experimental music, tropical ambience with eerie yowls, shimmery electropop, ominous lullabies, and one song that sounds like a distress call from a spaceship, set to a soft electronic beat. It winds up with the undulating, whispery \\"Still Light,\\" which is perhaps the creepiest song of all.<br /><br />In \\"Silent Shout,\\" the Knife strike a good balance between techno and experimental soundscapes, which was missing from their previous two albums -- both were good, but they had entirely different music. They've learned moderation, using the harder beats in a softer melody, and also creating dreamy soundscapes that may not get people dancing, but might transport them to another planet.<br /><br />The harder beats don't even sound catchy -- they sound more like a sonic attack. Other synth gets twisted into kettle drums, pretty shimmers, and eerie sonic walls. Karin's voice is heavily filtered by computers, but this isn't done because it's a bad voice. Rather, it makes the pretty, fragile vocals fit in with the otherworldly music, as she lets out a series of Bjorkian yowls and murmurs.<br /><br />The Knife would do a great job with the soundtrack to a sci-fi movie, since they already have the right sound -- chilly, eerie and beautiful.t this isn't done because it's a bad voice.

I read widely among the fiction genres, and of all the stories I have ever read, I loved this one enough to name my first-born son and only child after Bastian, the book-loving protagonist. This book is particularly rich, inspiring two movies with only the first HALF of its content. I firmly believe that anyone, everyone, should read this book, along with many other childhood favorites I have loved for years, \\"the secret garden\\", \\"the once and future king\\", \\"peter pan\\", \\"the hobbit\\"... well. it's beautiful. the language is educated and sophisticated, the imagery is fantastic, and the concepts are such as could be pondered by most adults and yield a gain in wisdom.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|Okay guys, first of all, I know you can't help but compare this flick (I hate to call it a film) to the video game, but that's a flawed view. This here is a movie, kids, and for a movie review, I have to judge this stinker on it's cinematic merits - not on how close the cast & crew were able to come to duplicating the gaming experience.<br /><br />So, two stars, 'cause this baby stank like rotten, year-old Cheez-Whiz, but I'll give it ten stars for the cheesiness factor. The best part of watching Silent Hill is tearing the crappy thing up while trying to figure out all the other movies it cheerfully rips off during the process. While the production design is initially kinda groovy, watch enough movies and you'll see the filmmakers stealing pieces from everything that's come down the pike the over last thirty years or so, including using the evil cult motiff from Robin Hardy and Anthony Shaffer'a eerily atmospheric thriller, The Wicker Man; the creepy, faceless, fast-frame jerky angel/demons from Adrian Lyne's mysterious Jacob's Ladder and bits from Clive Barker's macabre and operatic bloody vision, Hellraiser; all the way to the new fright-movie cliche, the spectral, evil, often lank-haired child (typically a little girl) introduced with the new wave of Asian horror cinema, a-la Hideo Nakata's Ringu (The Ring), Hideo Nakata's Dark Water, and Takashi Shimizu's Ju-On (The Grudge).<br /><br />The, uh, plot has already been outlined here extensively: Husband and wife Christoper and Rose Da Silva (Sean Bean and Radha Mitchell) adopt a beautiful, waif-ish girl named Sharon who's a cronic sleepwalker. At the beginning of the film we find Rose, panicked, racing to rescue sleepwalking Sharon from the edge of their backyard cliff. Okay. Sharon mumbles the name of a town, Silent Hill, over and over, and Rose decides to ditch hubby Christopher and take Sharon to this Silent Hill ghost town, because, heck, that'll help cure her of these whacky episodes, right? On the way, the pair becomes the subject of interest for a hot, tight-leather wearing female cop with an instinct for helping kids in trouble. Rose bolts after the cop decides to pull her over, and suddenly, there's a high-speed chase through the hills and into the off-limits town (turns out there's a coal fire still burning under the town after 30 plus years, and the town's deserted). There's a crash, and when Rose comes to, Sharon's gone. Not easily dissuaded by the creepy town, Rose heads out in search of her daughter, with the sexy cop and eventually, hubby Christopher in hot pursuit.<br /><br />Along the way Rose encounters a rogues gallery of ghoulishly evil characters; a crazy woman spouting fire and brimstone warnings; a flitting, waifish entity named Alessa that's the spitting image of her daughter Sharon; and finally, a crazy cult holed up in a church the size of Notre Dame, led by a woman who looks an awful lot like Sigourny Weaver impersonating a maniacal school-marm.<br /><br />To steal a segment from another Amazon reviewer, I did learn a few things watching Silent Hill, that I thought I'd pass on:<br />1. A house right on the edge of a cliff is the perfect living environment for an adopted child with a sleep walking condition.<br />2. When thinking of adoption, stay the hell away from waif-ish, doe-eyed little girls with long, stringy brown hair and insanely creepy split personalities. They always seem have some unknown problems you just don't want to deal with (see #1, above, for example...)<br />3. Note to all hot, sexy, tight black leather wearing cop-babes: shouting 'Stop!' before shooting a shambling, burning acid-spitting, humanoid thingy that looks like it's got another nine or ten people rolling around in its torso, fighting to get out, will only provoke getting said acid-spit directed your way.<br />4. Note to all aspiring horror film-makers: directing a shambling monster thingy's burning acid-spit toward a hot, sexy cop is the perfect way to get said cop to remove her burdensome leather clothing.<br />5. Muscle bound demon-guys with pyramids instead of heads are really scary and carry really, really big knives.<br />6. And I quote: Dahlia Gillespie: \\"Why didn't she take me? Like the others?\\" Rose: \\"Because you're her mother. Mother is God in the eyes of a child.\\" Whooo - That's deep.<br />7. You can only enter Silent Hill if you're dead. Um, I think. And if so, even dead people can still be burnt to death by crazed cult members. I think.<br />8. Crazed cult members bent on killing you will calm down easily if you just casually push them away.<br />9. Stiv carrying zombie-demon nurses are really hot; especially when they're lined up wearing skimpy demon-nurse uniforms, stumbling around like the chorus for a creepy version of Silent Hill, the musical.<br />10. When you finally find and confront the little devil-girl Alessa and discover 'The Truth', it turns out to be holiday footage of the Crazy Cult's special Little Witch Burning Day, preserved on badly deteriorating, overdeveloped film stock shot sometime circa 1973.<br /><br />That about covers it, I think, beyond getting into the extras included in the DVD, which is the increasingly standard making of documentary broken into a whopping six parts covering everything from the origins of the game to the creature development. Frankly, I found the extras more fun - definitely more interesting - than the finished movie.<br /><br />I love bad horror movies as much as the next guy, but except for coming away slightly nauseated, I've got to say that there's really not anything particularly scary in Silent Hill - other than the gawd-awful dialogue and crummy acting - it's just grisly. I really hate to think about anyone wanting to watch this stinker more than once. While video games have become more and more cinematic in their storytelling, Silent Hill is a perfect example of the ineptitude of incorporating corny, choppy plotlines - which work fine in a game format - into the film medium; and also, how low Hollywood has sunk in its continuing attempt to flush more and more cash from an increasingly growing market (all of us gamers out here, me included), who are too often willing to shell out our hard earned money - often up to $50 bucks a pop for most video games - for tripe like this.e bound demon-guys with pyramids instead of heads are really scary and carry really, really big knives.  6.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|\\"Can you see the wise man simply living, loving quietly...\\" so sings Ray LaMontagne on the title track of his latest release Till The Sun Turns Black. It's a lyric, you sense, that is close to the singer-songwriters heart, if not even some sort of personal credo. For Ray LaMontagne and his music are most determinedly not of this ever more frenetic age - and thank goodness for that. It's comforting to know that there are still genuine, unadulterated back-woods musical geniuses out there.  LaMontagne's songs seem to naturally embody the same sort of spirit, feel and grain of artists like Otis Redding, Van Morrison, Stephen Stills, and Ray Charles and yet even after just one album, his voice and style are umistakably his own. One listen to Ray LaMontagne and you don't soon forget it. Quite simply, the man moves me, and he also soothes my soul. I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling this.<br /><br />It's wonderful to discover then, that after the success of LaMontagne's 2004 debut Trouble, his new songs have lost nothing in the way of their original unpretensious, heart-on-sleeve earthiness. If anything, Till The Sun Turns Black is a touch more somber than Trouble, with a profound sense of melancholy running through even the lighter moments. Songs about hard times, self-doubt, and lost love can generally be relied upon to be compelling, but rarely are they so effortlessly graceful, hauntingly sincere and unutterably beautiful as they are on Till The Sun Turns Black.  Aided once more by the brilliant multi-instrumentalist Ethan Johns (it's hard to imagine any other producer for LaMontagne) the two prove beyond all doubt that Trouble was no fluke. It was in fact, only the beginning.  Without altering his style drastically, LaMontagne has really broadened his approach here.<br /><br />The fragile, bewitching Be Here Now opens proceedings, and immediately you are transfixed by waves of cascading piano, guitar, violins, atmospheric touches and LaMontagne himself repeating the title like a man possessed.  It's a tremendously moving start, and quite different to anything we've heard from him before - and it gets even better. `Empty' follows, in all of it's broken-down, desolate glory, and it's about as beautiful a Ray LaMontagne song as is possible to imagine. Over stirring, elegant strings the singer sets the scene - \\" She lifts her skirt up to her knees... walks through the garden rows with her barefeet laughing\\" before proceeding to knock that pretty image down with a crushing blow - \\"I've never learned to count my blessings but choose instead to dwell in my disasters\\". Clearly, the hellhounds on his trail have not been so easy to shake off. Like much of the songwriters work, `Empty' has a truly widescreen, cinematic feel. You could imagine it working brilliantly in a recent film like Brokeback Mountain, or, going back a few years, something like Badlands. More than once during the course of this song, as well as on other tracks like the stirring `Lesson Learned' or the Lennon-esque album closer `Within You' - the thought has struck me - how can one man's voice convey so much feeling? It's not only abundantly present in the soulful timbre of his voice, but also in the way he delivers a line. By turns hesitant, wistful, vulnerable, and impassioned.<br /><br />It's tempting at this point in my review to go through and dissect each successive track on Till The Sun Turns Black, but I'll spare you all of my gushing praise and leave it for your ears to experience, rather than your eyes.  Suffice to say though, whether LaMontagne turns his hand to funky, rump-shaking soul (Three More Days) or simple, unaffected balladry (Can I Stay) or rough-hewn, down & out blues (You Can Bring Me Flowers), the resulting songs, without exception, succeed on all counts. Till The Sun Turns Black is another wonderfully assured step forward for this enigmatic, deeply talented artist.<br /><br />Highlights: Be Here Now, Empty, Three More Days, Lesson Learned, Till The Sun Turns Black<br /><br />Like This?

B000GRTQSE|5.0|This CD I have listened to three times in the car and while I know this is not the best environment I think it is really good. I was disapponted with Time out Of Mind and came to love Love and Theft. This one while, defintely breezier, than both has a certain immediate charm that is missing from large parts of both. I know it sounds like a Love and Theft part II but what's wrong with that? <br /> <br />The songs are great and it sounds fantastic. It is hard to imagine people complaining about this album if it had been released in the early 90s or 80s. Maybe Bob has spoiled us recently, but I believe this is a great great album.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is still the preeminent Superman movie.  It's still the one against which all others are judged, and rightfully so.  It has action and humor, love and tension.  Plus, it has the best acting by a bunch of people no one had ever heard of before (except for Gene Hackman and Ned Beaty, of course).      Christopher Reeve got it.  He got the characters, both Clark Kent and Superman.  In the current Superman Returns, Brandon Routh got Superman, but didn't really have a clue about Clark Kent.  This is one of the reasons why this first Superman extravaganza is the gold-standard.      Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) was very much on target with her character too.      Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor was more comical than menacing, but I think it was more entertaining that way.    What I liked was that this movie was taken seriously by those involved.  It had humor (the phone booth scene was hilarious to those of us who remember the older days of Superman) but it wasn't campy.    Special effects weren't bad for a movie made in the 1970s and like the promo said \\"You'll believe that a man can fly!\\"  The effects can't quite compete with what we have today, but I noticed that there weren't any dramatic improvements in Superman Returns.    It's entertaining and you can even watch it with your whole family!  What a concept!
B00000DC10|5.0|I bought this album when it came out and listened to it pretty frequently. I kind of grew out of the whole punk/hardcore phase when I graduated high school.  I was looking through old cds I had not listened to in awhile and popped this in.  I appreciate this album more now than when it came out cause it is still better than anything punk or hardcore coming now. I would say this is one of the best political punk albums ever.  People who listen to it now think it doesn't sound to different from bands now, but this came out in 1998, way before all the garbage out now.  If youre looking for a pissed off, political punk album from guys who actually knew how to play there instruments this a great album to pick up.  And no this isn't screamo.  Not even close.  If you want a real screamo album go pick up something by saetia, the assistant, orchid or early circle takes the square, if you can find that.
B00005JP5J|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is one of the funniest family comedies I've seen in awhile. It's a story about a typical suburban family focuses on a little girl who dreams of success in beauty pageants.  Olive, age 7, has nothing else really going for her besides her ambition.  She enters numerous contests with the dream of taking home the crown, even placing second in the Little Miss Sunshine competition.  Her mother, played by Toni Collette is the complete opposite of a stage mom.  She is encouraging to the point of being nauseous--even when the audience knows her daughter doesn't stand a chance.  Olive's father, Greg Kinnear, instead usurps the role of stage mom letting Olive know that if she even dares to eat a bowl of ice cream she might wind up fat. The cast of Little Miss Sunshine is rounded out by Steve Carell at his humorous peak as the sarcastic, suicidal gay uncle, Alan Arkin as the porn-obsessed grandfather who gives Olive hope, and Paul Dano as her introspective older brother who can't even be bothered to speak.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a movie for families--not in the traditional sense, but anyone who can understand that any of the National Lampoon's Vacations--and I mean the early ones with Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase--are family films will certainly get this one.  It's the family comedy in the way that they don't make them anymore.  Dysfunctional, sarcastic, hilarious.  If you go into it with an open mind, then I'm positive you will enjoy this film.

Where there was not a lot of room for improvement over the Budokan DVD as it was fantastic, the guys managed to raise the bar even higher with \\"Score\\"!  <br /> <br />With everything a DT fan could ask for and more, \\"Score\\" hits on highlights from the last 20 years without repeating, for the most part, other DVD collections and absolutely kills with every song. The inclusion of the orchestra for the whole Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance was mind blowing and an event unto itself.  <br /> <br />The documentary is a fantastic history. It would have been great to hear from Kevin Moore, he and the first lead singer, Chris, from the Majesty days, are the only folks not heard from. The three bonus tracks are a great glimpse at the history of the band while representing songs not heard or seen live on DVD (though the \\"Another Day\\" video is part of their first live concert).    <br /> <br />The biggest improvement with this DVD from the last is the sound. The new PCM stereo option is THE choice you need to make when listening to this DVD. On the 5.1 track, James LeBrie is lost in the mix. But the PCM track is a perfect mix and fixes what was the Budokan's only flaw. <br /> <br />I have looked forward to this DVD since it was announced and it was everything and more that I hoped for!
0393057658|5.0|Field of Stats<br /><br />Although the steroid scandal may have eventually accomplished the same thing, \\"Moneyball\\" destroys any persistent romance surrounding professional baseball. It's an antidote to all those paeans glorifying the love of the game: \\"The Natural,\\" \\"Field of Dreams,\\" even the raunchy lens of \\"Bull Durham.\\"  Players don't rise and fall due to the nobility of their character, the sheer beauty of their swing, the sage advice of a wizened baseball scout, or even their batting average, per se.  What Moneyball does is show how the Oakland A's, and a few emulators, dismissed all this lore and culture in favor of multiple regressions and other advanced statistical tools. It's a fascinating book that could have been a dry one--full of detailed statistics and equations--except that Lewis cleverly balances the mathematical perspective with the same character studies that have graced sports biographies for years.<br /><br />The book centers around former big league prospect Billy Beane, a man with great athletic ability who didn't make it in the bigs, partly because of his perfectionism and resulting temper.  Years later, Beane is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a team with stingy owners who'd rather save some bucks than buy a pennant (see \\"Yankees, The\\"). Faced with a shoestring budget, and enamored with the new baseball analysis cultivated by Bill James in his \\"Baseball Digest\\" system, Beane and his advisors invest in players as if they're brokers on Wall Street. James and other highly-educated baseball fanatics (often from Harvard, often lawyers or scientists with a mathematical bent) discover that the old wisdom wasn't all that smart:  Their analyses yield cold, objective facts, and suddenly, as in the old \\"Firesign Theater\\" skit, \\"Everything You Know Is Wrong.\\"  It's not batting average and RBIs that are most important, it's on-base and slugging percentage that predict the one thing, the only outcome that matters--who wins.  Throw out fielding statistics--these are too dependent on luck and the kind of pitches served up. Furthermore, invest in bargains: Overlooked players who get to first through walks rather than singles (the phrase, \\"a walk is good as a hit,\\" was never so true as it is here), guys who aren't great all-around players but who fill complete missing elements in your roster (sort of like diversifying your portfolio, Beane and others take their cue from a market mechanism known as \\"derivatives\\"), and those who otherwise don't fit into other GMs' and scouts atheoretical notion of what makes a great player.<br /><br />The results are convincing. With one of the least expensive teams in baseball, the A's repeatedly make the playoffs.  Beane acquires college players and castoffs from other teams like a man who collects trashy art, and XXX shows how his \\"I must be insane to offer you these bargains\\" style of purchasing ball players pays off, mostly through chapters devoted to one particular exemplar of Beane's philosophy.<br /><br />There are a few problems with the book, as there are a few problems with the stats-driven approach to building your team.  The most egregious of these is Lewis' concentration on the successes predicted by statistics.  For a book driven by science, Lewis ignores the other 3 cells of the implicit 2x2 table of success/failure by \\"uses Beane method\\"/\\"doesn't use method.\\"  The most significant is the failure/Beane method cell; Lewis just doesn't write about those players who didn't pan out as mathematically predicted.  The only examination of failure is Beane's rather clinical excuse for never advancing very far in the playoffs--in a short series (I.e., when N is small), luck (i.e., the statistical error) tends to become more powerful and empirical \\"truths\\" suffer as a result.  The fans suffer too, but their enjoyment of the game is always secondary to winning. Therefore, Athletics almost never steal bases (the percentages dictate no), and managerial and player judgmentis minimized in favor of the all mighty victory.  You have to admit it works, but when Beane shrugs off the post-season failure question almost with a \\"that's not my job,\\" you have to wonder whether \\"Moneyball\\" is enough.  Maybe it's just the best oine can do on a budget. (On the other hand, XXX Lewis to mention--even in his most recently written epilogue--that Beane's right hand man Paul DePodesta was fired after 2 seasons with the well-financed Dodgers.(A 71-91, 4th place finish in 2005 didn't help DePodesta.) Along with this bias towards success stories, XXX reveals a few bad writing habits.  He'll sometimes describe something with  sentences repeatedly beginning with the word \\"that.\\"  As in: \\"That the book doesn't look enough at failures. That the book was a best seller.  That the book was reportedly misunderstood by many when published.\\"  Lewis also lapses into a high-falutin' prose style, somewhat emulating \\"King James\\"--Bill James of the pioneering Baseball Digest school of analysis.<br /><br />Still, \\"Moneyball\\" deserves its reputation and its sales. Beane's number-crunching, myth-busting approach isn't always pretty, but it makes sense and meets the bottom line of both winning and preserving capital. An excellent and accessible book that has it both ways, an argument for using \\"cold\\" higher math in sports, and a spirited study of the ballplayers who add value to the original purchase, and the GMs who know what it takes to buy low and sell high.judgment is minimized in favor of the all mighty victory.

0517548232|5.0|This short book by Henry Hazlitt is a must read for those who are curious about  capitalism but don't want to spend too much time and effort reading something more elaborate to begin with. I read it all in about six-hours. <br /> <br />For the very impatient, I would suggest they start with the second last chapter to get the big picture, and then read it from the start for explanation, examples and detail. <br /> <br />For further reading and study, I would recommend: 'Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics by George Reisman' <br />
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Perhaps an alternate title for this movie could have been \\"Hostile\\" because Hostel was quite gory and gruesome, just as I'd hoped. If you couldn't get enough of either Saw or Saw II (and are as excited about the upcoming theatrical release of Saw III) then Hostel is right up your alley. What's most shocking are all the reviews here commenting about the nudity at the beginning of the film. You have to keep in mind that the setting is in Amsterdam and people over there are less hung up about nudity. That being said, I think it fits perfectly into the movie. The story follows 3 guy friends around Amsterdam, who head to another town for the women and the prospect of what these women will do...the locals say the women will do ANYTHING and just love American men. The guys go, and sure enough, sexy women abound, taking them out for a night of fun. Everything seems great until the next morning when one of the friends is discovered to have left. The 2 remaining guys try to find their friend but he never returns or calls them back. Even more disturbing, he's sent them a picture from his camera phone saying he's gone home. But things soon get even stranger in this strangeland and to say more would ruin it for anyone else who's been wanting to see this. If gory and gruesome are things you enjoy in a movie, you should not miss Hostel. I was riveted from beginning to end, and I must say I very much liked the ending too. Be prepared though...this is not for the squeamish. You've been warned. A must-see for fans of this genre.

1401302378|4.0|Chris Anderson has written a thought-provoking book in The Long Tail.  It's about the new economics of culture and commerce.  While I enjoyed thinking about the main premise - that the Internet has dramatically changed the interplay between supply and demand - I once again concluded that the book could have been a lot shorter (possibly a result of my taking the book \\"Blink\\" to heart).<br /><br />The title refers to the shape of a classic downward-sloping demand curve if you graphed popularity (x-axis) vs. demand (y-axis).  Think about book industry where the demand for a few titles (bestsellers or even top 100) is very high, but demand for the 200,000th most popular book is sporadic at best.  Consequently, Barnes & Noble stores can only carry books with a certain level of demand and will miss a lot of the niche topics that are out there.<br /><br />But, because of the Internet, the demand captured in the 'long tail' of this curve, comprised of thousands of niche businesses, represents a vibrant business.  For example, while the typical Barnes & Noble will carry 100,000 titles, Amazon offers 3.7 million and says that 25% of their sales come from books outside of the top 100,000 titles.  They claim, and the premise of the book is, that as companies offer increased supply (because in the new Internet economy, they can), demand seems to follow supply and, in fact, increases.<br /><br />Another related trend is the transition across business lines from 'hit' to 'niche', which is exemplified by the popularity of myspace.com, ebay, itunes and google (representing the long tail of advertising).<br /><br />The six main themes of the book are:<br /><br />1.  In virtually all markets, there are far more niche goods than hits, as a result of improvements in the basic tools of production (i.e. Internet).<br /><br />2. The costs of reaching these niches is now falling dramatically thanks to digital distribution, search and a critical mass of broadband technology.<br /><br />3. There are a range of tools - from recommendations to rankings (think search) that help to shift demand down the long tail, and help people find useful/relevant niches.<br /><br />4. The effect of all of this is that the demand curve will eventually flatten, with the hits becoming relatively less popular and the niches growing in popularity.<br /><br />5. All of the niches add up to comprise a market that rivals the hits.<br /><br />6. The internet can reveal a natural shape of demand, undistorted by distribution bottlenecks, scarcity of information and limited choice of shelf space.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all those interested in a well thought out premise on how the internet has radically altered many business models due to various supply and demand characteristics and the ability to exploit demand that would previously not have been profitable.There are a range of tools - from recommendations to rankings (think search) that help to shift demand down the long tail, and help people find useful/relevant niches. <br />4.

B00000K19E|5.0|Movies weren't made like The Matrix before it came out.  The movie is revolutionary in so many ways; so much so that we now take it for granted as it seems most movie-makers try to emulate the style(s).<br /><br />Just having the 120-or-so cameras positioned in the circular pattern to show the jump kicks or the famous dodging of the bullets scene had never before been considered.  If you are the type who doesn't care about storylines and just wants to watch fast-moving Kung Fu, you can get that from The Matrix easy.<br /><br />But let's say you appreciate well-developed, finely engrained storylines with awesome depth...  Well, The Matrix boasts one of the finest stories ever created.  It mirrors the anxiety of the classic conspiracy theory movies, yet provides excellent tie-ins with common life.  The Matrix offers analogies regarding regular, daily life, then magically connects them to that vast conspiracy that no one is aware of.<br /><br />The biggest kick I get out of the movie is that is plays on nearly every personality type.  For example, you know those people who swear \\"everybody else\\" is ignorant and living in the dark?  \\"They don't know how to raise their children!\\"  \\"They aren't smart enough to understand what I am talking about!\\"  \\"If they only knew what I know!\\"  Etcetera.  Well, imagine being an insider on The Matrix!<br /><br />Or how about the other personality of the conspiracy theorists?  \\"The government is behind everything!\\"  \\"The Illuminati are only a few people who control the whole world!\\"  Etcetera.  Ho, boy.<br /><br />Or the rock-'em-up, sock-'em'up types that just giggle and chuckle when a bad guy gets his hiney handed to him in a swift, bad-butt kind of way...<br /><br />The Matrix is philosophically DEEP, and the action is the best around, even nowadays.  This movie is a classic, folks, and it was instantly so.  It set the standard for action movies to come, and it will always be a great watch.  If you are one of the few folks who hasn't purchased the DVD yet, I encourage you to find the Trilogy set and buy it.  I often make \\"Matrix weekends\\" for myself.<br /><br />Oh, and if you are female or are considering watching The Matrix series with one - but you know she is not really into this sort of movie - tell her it is a love story.  You won't be lying - most of Neo's (the main character) major decisions originate from his love for a woman.<br /><br />And even though I am not a huge fan of Keanu Reeves, you will not be able to see anything poorly done until the second episode.  But there is only one occurrence of that.<br /><br />Get the trilogy!purchased the DVD yet, I encourage you to find the Trilogy set and buy it.

B000E33VWW|3.0|Picking stars is impossible -- this is a very good and well-made (5 stars), quite intriguing but unenjoyable (1 star) film.<br /><br />To start with -- the murder of the Clutters is so awful and senseless it defies reason.<br /><br /> This DVD is dark dark dark, not only the murders but Capote's winter visits to Leavenworth prison in Kansas, such that the next film I watched, Sideways, looked upbeat and brimming with joy by comparison.<br /><br />We have Capote appropriately engrossed by these murders when he reads about them in the paper.<br /><br />Capote may have invented new journalism, or at least laid its foundations. He received unbelievable access to the sheriff and the murderers and manipulated all, such that today nearly 50 years later, it would be impossible for a journo to go around peaking in caskets or thumbing through the sheriff's interrogation notes.<br /><br />This is the first glamorization of losers that I can recall in modern history (maybe others can correct me if I am mistaken), a start of the trend that brings us to gangsta rap today.<br /><br />Finally, Philip Seymour Hoffman provides a near-perfect but just slightly over-the-top depiction of Truman Capote -- take a look at some interviews with the real-life Capote on [...] for interesting comparisons.<br /><br />PS -- One earlier reviewer stated that the murders  are never re-enacted. Oh yes they are! It's toward the end, and sketchy, but it's there.

B000GFLAI0|3.0|I like this album. But I realize that anything under 5 stars for Bob Dylan is a major disappointment, especially since it has been 5 years since the last cd. Dylan's voice here is great, rich and full and very pleasing to my ears (some of us like Dylan for his voice, not despite of it). I'm glad he is over the pinched, whiny quality of his voice in the early 90's. As for the band on Modern Times Dylan says in his recent Rolling Stone interview that this is the best bunch of musicians he has worked with. Yeah. Right, Bob. The band on Love And Theft (Larry Campbell, Charlie Sexton, and David Kemper) puts the current lineup to shame (There was also some guys named Robbie, Levon, Rick, etc. a few years ago who were pretty good). The band here is fine - very competent and professional, but nothing ever catches fire. Most of the songs move along at a nice rolling pace that gets repetitive quickly. Bob croons over these old-timey melodies and I confess that after 4 listens I felt my hand move toward the skip button on a few of these songs. There is a distinct lack of rock that I don't like. As for the songs - what are they about? Well, most are about 6 or 7 minutes and one is about 9 minutes. The lyrics talk about love, women, God etc. but I couldn't tell you what Dylan is trying to get across lyrically. It sounds like Bob has taken a bunch of often great lines and crafted them together very nicely to make a \\"Classic Dylan\\" album, even more inscrutable than usual. As someone once said, \\"What looks large from a distance close up ain't ever that big\\". Reviews for Modern Times have been entirely positive. I can understand that - it's a very nice sounding Dylanesque offering. The man is 65 years old (how many more albums can he do?)and we are all relieved that at least he didn't screw the pooch like he did so many times in the late 80's. But the thing you have to understand about Dylan is that, contrary to everything he says, he is concerned about what people think of his worknow. He is on the radar until he dies - no more \\"small\\" albums coming out every year to relatively little notice. Every album is an event - what is the great icon BOB DYLAN going to do next? As far as Dylan's art goes I am pretty sure this is not a good thing.    UPDATE 8/31/10: After living with Together Through Life for a while Modern Times looks like Blood On The Tracks. I really should have given this 4 stars and Together 1 star. I hope Bob can turn things around for his next release but it ain't looking good.

B00005JOQS|5.0|The Man of Steel was gone for over twenty years and he came back a grown-up.  That is the genius of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, a film that both stands on its own merits and still manages to evoke the splendor of the Superman movies of the late 1970's.  The heart pounding special effects and super heroics are all here, but now they come packaged in a story replete with symbolism and a level of emotional depth that is not normally to be found in a summer blockbuster super hero movie.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is not your father's Superman.  The Man of Steel, played by the able newcomer Bandon Routh, returns to Earth after having spent five years exploring the remnants of his dead home planet, Krypton.  Things have changed in the last five years though. The old crew is still there, with Ma Kent (Eva Marie Saint) looking after the farm in Smallville, Perry White (Frank Langella) editing the Daily Planet and Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) snapping photos of Metropolis' favorite hero.<br /><br />However, you can never go home again, and the Last Son of Kyrpton is shaken to find that the love of his life, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), is an unwed mother of son, Jason, (Tristan Lake Leabu) with a live in boyfriend, Perry White's nephew, Richard (James Marsden).  Perhaps the only thing that has remained totally consistent is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) who, having stolen Kryptonian technology from Superman's Fortress of Solitude, is planning to use it to create a whole new continent on Earth and sink the United States beneath the waves.<br /><br />The action scenes in Superman Returns are suitably impressive.  If the tag line to the original 1978 movie was \\"You'll believe that a man can fly,\\" the 2006 version should be, \\"Now you'll really believe that a man can fly!\\"  The sequences are memorable, and one in particular, where Superman saves an airliner that is about to crash, will almost certainly have the audience out of their seats and cheering.<br /><br />However, the action is almost secondary.  Superman Returns is really noteworthy for its surprisingly complex emotions and symbolism.  Superman is still the square jawed hero, almost impossibly noble and virtuous.  However, he is also a deeply sad figure, lonely and denied his heart's desire by the call of duty to a world whose agony he can literally hear. He is, as his Kryptonian father Jor-El (Marlon Brando) tells him, \\"Raised among them but not one of them,\\" and for all his mighty powers Superman is denied the simple pleasures of wife, family and ordinary human companionship.<br /><br />In this, by the way, Superman compares more than favorably to his Marvel Comics hero counterpart, Spiderman, who whines incessantly about the burdens of his powers and who does not hesitate to steel the girl from an honorable man. Superman bears his pain quietly and, though tempted, does not use his powers to take from ordinary men whom he could easily brush aside.  That nobility, with its overtones of Christian sacrifice, the screenwriters and Singer brilliantly capture in both dialogue and in splendid visual symbols.<br /><br />The acting in Superman Returns has not been compared favorably to the original Christopher Reeve movies, but this is mistaken.  Unlike the legendary Reeve, whose Superman was 100% the square jawed hero with a touch of irony, Brandon Routh plays Superman with far greater emotional depth.  This is the man behind the hero, powerful and noble, but also emotionally vulnerable, lonely, and even at times a bit frightened.  Similarly, kudos go to Routh for his portrayal of Clark Kent.  Somehow, in the 1978 movie, \\"mild-mannered reporter\\" got translated into \\"three-footed dufus.\\" This was a ridiculous approach, and Routh here rights that imbalance, giving the viewer a much more believable Kent.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane also surpasses Margot Kidder's shrill characterization.  Bosworth portrays Lois by turns as a loving mother and a tough career woman who, just beneath the surface, carries a bitter but conflicted resentment toward the hero who left her behind without saying good-bye.  Bosworth plays this shrewdly.  The anger and resentment are not just dumped out on the screen for the viewer to see, but rather seeps out in bits and pieces here and there.  Moreover, like the man that she truly still loves, she does not forsake another good man just to have the hero.  These are adults, they have made choices, and they live with the consequences.<br /><br />The other actors handle their parts with equal effectiveness and commendable skill.  Spacey's Luthor is not the clownish figure of Gene Hackman's 1978 portrayal, but is a genius with an almost frightening sadistic streak.  He was imprisoned for five years and he wants revenge.  There is humor, but there is also a chilling streak of pure evil. Langella's Perry White is not some boor bellowing in a newsroom, but is a cool professional who takes care of his people and his paper.  Sam Huntington's Jimmy Olsen is a likeable and very human person whose friendship for Clark is both boyishly endearing and deeply genuine.  Parker Posey is properly entertaining, and the presence of Noel Neill and Jack Larson is a nice touch.<br /><br />James Marsden also deserves special credit.  The character of Richard White is an especially tough one because it is easy to dislike him for standing in the way of the Lois - Superman relationship.  Yet Marsden shines in the part.  His Richard White is haunted by the possibility that the family he truly and deeply loves will be carried off by a god-like guy in a cape.  Yet he perseveres and becomes in a way the unsung hero of the film. He risks more than Superman because he has more to lose. Yet he saves Superman even when he knows that doing so may cost him what he loves most.<br /><br />Superman Returns is a surprisingly rich and complex movie, yet it manages to retain all the excitement of the typical summer blockbuster.

B000GIWS7E|5.0|\\"Score\\" marks the 5th offical live DVD from Dream Theater & just when you think they can't top themselves ... they do it again. Foregt the complaints about the set-list, this disc ROCKS.  <br /> <br />The first act quickly covers the span of DT's career, and the guys do a great job picking songs that aren't what you'd expect. I especially liked hearing \\"Another Won\\" from the Majesty Demos (there's a cool edit of this version with an original video of the band doing it with Chris Collins before they had a record deal at the end of the documentarty on disc two.) and \\"Raise The Knife\\" from the FII sessions.  <br /> <br />The second act is even more impressive. They open with the orchestra playing the overture from 6DOIT. This sounds great, but I think they extended it a bit, and it gets to be a little too much by the time it's done. But this is a minor complaint. The rest of this awesome epic sounds phenomenal.  \\"Vacant\\" sounds even eerier with James singing over just the symphony before the rest of the guys join in. And \\"Octavarium\\" ... what can I say, it's just INCREDIBLE. But the best is yet to come. They play \\"Metropolis\\" for an encore, and I don't think it's ever sounded BETTER ! The horns add so much to the overall instrumentation - it gave me chills at first listen. <br /> <br />The secod disc is great too. The Documentary gives a really great peek into the history of the band, but it tends to focus on the early stuff before the current lineup was solidified. I would have liked to hear more regarding the recording of the last 4 albums, but again that's really just nit-picking.  <br /> <br />Overall an AWESOME disc, and a must-have for DT fans.
B000006FNX|5.0|\\"Never Say Never Again\\" is a fantastic action thriller directed by Irvin Kershner. It is the remake of \\"Thunderball\\". However, it is still an enjoyable action packed adventure movie.<br /><br />Sean Connery plays his role brilliantly, despite his age (53). This is vintage Sean Connery, an older, wiser and audacious man. He has not lost his touch with ladies. Kim gives a good performance as the bad guy's pal. Barbara Carrera performs her role as the sexy, clever and wicked Fatima Blush very well. Klaus Maria Brandauer is also a remarkable villain while Irvin Kershner's direction is commendable. Rowan Atkinson makes an interesting and amusing appearance.<br /><br />Among some of my unforgettable scenes are the opening war-game teaser, the battle with Lippe at Shrublands, and a great motorcycle chase. Despite his age, Connery is surprisingly very fast, agile and very witty.<br /><br />The plot is sound and interesting. A SPECTRE agent under the command of Ernst Blofeld infiltrates a US Air Force base located in the United Kingdom and steals two Tomahawk cruise missiles. James Bond must find them before they are detonated. The characterization is superb and I liked the ending.

His sister's ever-present best friend and yet he's just now figuring out she's more than that.<br /><br />Penelope is the wallflower with a secret love and secret hobby. But she never really shows us she deserves the romance she gets.<br /><br />It seems like a lot of time wasted on indulging the Bridgerton clan wars, with interjection of unlikely romance, no real passion and arbitrary plot twists. Midway through the book, I felt like Quinn decided to write a different story, albeit one more exciting but with the same dud characters from the first half of the book.
B0000035E7|5.0|I highly recommend this album for Nirvana fans and everyone else, too.   <br />It has a visceral, angry feel to it that is somewhat smoothed over in Nevermind.  The guitar riffs are compelling and there are several solos which show Cobain's incredible talent.  His vocals are also more savage, deeper and rougher, than in later albums. <br />Fans of the subtler songs like \\"Dumb\\" and \\"Lithium\\" will probably be disappointed.  But if \\"Rape Me\\", \\"Stay Away\\" and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" are more your thing then you should take a look at Bleach. <br />All in all, an excellent album!

B000EDWKXI|5.0|Set all in Venice, this movie is beautiful.  Many<br /><br />scene shots that have probably not been used before.<br /><br />As I do not know Venice well, I cannot appreciate the<br /><br />beauty in this movie fully, or know which scenes were<br /><br />for props rather than the actual Venetian environment.<br /><br /> Many antique buildings with beautiful art inside, at<br /><br />least one ancient room which was never filmed in<br /><br />before.

Some things were digitally added for the<br /><br />movie, but they did not overdo it.  The air balloon<br /><br />with strings was digital, the colorful sail that opens<br /><br />when a ship sails out is put in that way, and when<br /><br />Casanova is running away from some guards near the<br /><br />beginning, some enhancements are edited in as well.<br /><br />Ledger, unsurprisingly, has some great improv skills,<br /><br />though his choice to insist on wearing glasses in one<br /><br />scene was bad as it really did not fit in with the<br /><br />times at all or help fortify the movie's story at all.<br /><br />The pig in the story was hard to manage as they could<br /><br />not get a well trained pig for the movie.

0192802631|5.0|One of the major sources of contention and strife in my marriage is the disagreement between my wife and me over what is the best Jane Austen novel (yes, we are both more than a bit geekish in our love of words and literature--our second biggest ongoing quarrel is about the merits of the serial comma). <br /> <br />For my money, there are three of Austen's six finished novels that one can make a good argument for being her \\"best\\": <br /> <br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (the popular choice, and my wife's) <br />\\"Emma\\" (the educated choice--most lit profs go with this one) <br />\\"Persuasion\\" (the truly refined choice) <br /> <br />Harrold Bloom in \\"The Western Canon\\" calls it perhaps a \\"perfect novel,\\" and while I disagree with some of his interpretations of the characters (yes, blasphemy, I know), I wholeheartedly concur with his overal assessment. <br /> <br />While all of Austen's novels are generally comic, \\"Persuasion\\" is the most nuanced.  It's been described as \\"autumnal\\" and that word suits it.  There's a bittersweetness to it that you just don't get in Austen's other work. <br /> <br />The novel it comes closest to in terms of character and plot is probably one of her earliest novels \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\"  Like Eleanor in that novel, Anne is older and more mature than the typical Austen heroine.  In fact, she's dangerously close to being \\"over the hill\\" at the age of 27(!).  Love has passed her by, apparently. <br /> <br />But unlike Eleanor, who one always feels will muddle through even if she ends up disappointed in affairs of the heart, there's something more dramatically at stake with Anne.  She is in great danger of ceasing to exist, not physically, but socially.  When we meet her, she's barely there at all.  Although a woman of strong feelings, she is ignored and literally overlooked by most of the other characters.  In the universe of Austen's novels, the individual doesn't truly exist unless connected with the social world, and while Anne has a stoic strength, we understand that she is in some senses doomed if things don't change for her. <br /> <br />This is where we see what the mature Austen can do with a character type that she couldn't when she was younger.   <br /> <br />This edition also has the original ending of the novel included as an appendix, which gives us a rare and fascinating look in to Austen as a technical artist. <br /> <br />I read this novel as an undergraduate, and have reread it several times since.  I even took the novel with me to Bath on a trip to England, and spent a wonderful summer evening reading it while sitting in Sidney Gardens, across the street from one of the homes Austen lived in during her time in Bath, listening to Mozart's Piano Concerto #27.  It's one of my favorite memories. <br /> <br />More than any other of her novels, \\"Persuasion\\" shows how Austen dealt with profound existential questions within the confines of her deceptively limited setting and cast of characters.  Those who think Austen is simply a highbrow precursor to contemporary romance novels or social comedies are missing the colossal depth of thought that is beneath the surface of any of her novels, this one most of all. <br /> <br />Austen is nearly unique in the history of the novel for the consistency of her excellence.  While most novelists have a clear masterpiece that stands out among their work, and usually a fairly sizable number of works that are adequate but not enduring, all of Austen's novels stand up to repeated readings and deserve a wide audience among today's readers. <br /> <br />Having said that, \\"Persuasion\\" is simply the best of the best. <br />
1400031354|5.0|If you prefer books that make your heart beat faster with the turn of every page you may not like this one.  If you like books that make your heart smile you will like this series.<br /><br />I always like to read books in series in order.  That's what I'm doing with this one.  I loved the first book and enjoyed this one even more.  Before I finished the first one I ordered all but the last book.  I finished \\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" yesterday and started the third one, \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" last night.<br /><br />These books are the first I've read by this author.  I don't know how he has managed to be a professor of medical law and write over 50 books--some for children.  I am very curious to know if his other books are as satisfying as this series has been so far.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|An absolute gem of a show - so sad it finished after only 4 seasons.Sorry life in the uk so we were up until know way behind. <br /> <br />The cast, the scenery & this first season gave some all inspiring storylines & the finale was gutwrenching in every way.  More to the point its the first series in years to be a real family show with heart and soul. <br /> <br /> <br />It did not dissappoint in anyway and was well worth the buy.  Well thought out, superb cast who gave charisma, energy, heart and emotion and who made this show so real to watch.   <br /> <br />In a league of its own and deservedly put some actors onto the road to fame, the chemistry and that it was timeless in everyway & the first season in its own right is so unique. Well done to all & these characters and this show will not be forgotten for the writing behind them was shear class.
B00005JM0B|3.0|This film was highly anticipated by many, including myself. I came away from it feeling just blah. Was it terrible? I don't think so, but it did not live up to any potential it had. The biggest flaw of the film is that it remakes Terminator 2 just like T2 remade T1. Cameron had good reason to expand his vision with a massive budget and bravura special-effects but he never forgot that his chase movie was a story about a mother and son and a father figure, personified by Arnold, at it's heart.     What exactly is at the heart of Jonathan Mostow's Terminator 3? It can't be the same regurgitated son and surrogate father thing, can it? I think not. Is it the burgeoning relationship with the Claire Danes character? Nope. Then, what the hell is it? I guess it's about fate and how it is actually set in stone and that no matter what the hell you do, you cannot out smart or defeat destiny. This message contradicts the message of the previous film rather blatantly, which stated that we really are the determining factor of our own respective futures.    So, in T3 you get a bunch of nonsense, a female terminator for one, who looks like a runway model. The whole convoluted Skynet sub-plot, the aging Arnold going through his old routine but now with absurd, over the top emotional scenes! The Claire Danes character standing in as the tough female for Linda Hamilton, who wanted nothing to do with this movie. The recycled chase sequences straight out of Terminator 2 and so on. Even with all those negatives, I have to hand it to Mostow for not chickening out in the end, Judgement Day happens, finally! I'm happy we won't have to watch Terminator 4 following the same exact plot-line as all the other films. Then again, it is Hollywood, so who knows? Hehehe...    This 2-Disc DVD of the movie is average, with some limited special features, not even a decent documentary on the film, only a cheap HBO making of special. The DVD is certainly not a standout by any measure. You want a standout DVD? Check out the T2: Ultimate Edition, that is one slick puppy but if you're a Terminator fan, you definitely own that by now.
1400034779|5.0|Absolutely delightful!  I agree with all the others who left five stars for this book.  When I read a series I always try to read them in order.  I was tempted to buy the last book in the series at an airport bookstore.  When I realized that there are six or seven earlier books I put the book back on the shelf, but made a mental note to buy the first one later.  As I was reading this book I liked it so much that I ordered most of the books in the series.  I think if you read the first book first you won't be disappointed as others have suggested.  You'll simply want to read more.  I just finished the second book, \\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" and did find it even more enjoyable than the first.  I started the third book, \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" last night and am already sucked-in.  So far, \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" books have filled my heart with quiet joy.  I am going to give all the books to my mother who I think will adore them.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|The production, special effects, and presentation is absolutely wonderful. It's up there with the Blue Man Group as to DVD viewing pleasure. As to the songs themselves, they sound slightly different in some cases that a music CD only but not enough to take away from the experience of owning this DVD.
B000002H70|5.0|This has got to be my favorite from them, then kiss me kiss me kiss me.  I pratically grew up on these songs...so i'm slightly biased when it comes to this album...fond, nostalgic memories.  Every cut on this album is extraordinary!
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang bears more than one watching for its tangled plot (although nicely explicated in the end), its numerous throwaway funny lines, and its sheer entertainment.  Robert Downey Jr. is a small-time NYC theft artist who stumbles into a movie audition while fleeing the police.  The audition leads to Hollywood,a friendship with gay private detective Val Kilmer, and the chance to at last sleep with the old high school flame who went to bed with every boy in the school but him.  It also leads him smack into a murder mystery and a body in his apartment.  Downey and Kilmer have great fun with their roles and the supporting cast is fine as well.  LA also stars, looking as glitzy and tawdry as it did in other LA noir classics LA Confidential and Chinatown.  Round it all out with snacks and a nice bottle of wine and you've got a great night of at-home entertainment.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|There are So many things to enjoy, appreciate and admire in this concert.

B00004TRD8|5.0|The T2: Ultimate Edition DVD came out 6 years ago when the DVD format was still gaining in popularity and yet it still remains one of the finest single movie DVD editions of them all. Skip the later Extreme Edition which was only released to capitalize on the much anticipated arrival of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in theaters. Buy the Extreme Edition only if you want to hear the James Cameron/William Wisher commentary track. <br /> <br />Back to T2: Ultimate Edition, this baby is loaded top to bottom with features, commentaries, clips, an alternate ending, an entire screenplay and a total breakdown of every facet of the film's production, from pre-production to marketing and release strategy. Yes, like a total film school in one shiny case. You better believe the case is shiny, Artisan actually relased this DVD in a metal slip cover initially, that's right, real metal! Talk about doing things the right way. <br /> <br />Now for the movie, you get both the theatrical cut and the special edition. Although you may want to view the special edition once in a while, if you're a true movie buff, you'll realize the utter superiority of the theatrical film. It is James Cameron's real vision, after all. He has stated this on many occasions. The theatrical version is better paced, tighter and just flows wonderfully, it's perfection. The special edition version is more bloated in it's running time obviously and these scenes don't add much value to the film but they do take away from it. For instance Arnold grinning like some ugly horse? Yeesh! <br /> <br />T2, the theatrical cut, is a sci-fi masterpiece of epic proportions and all the talk about it's advancement of digital technology, it's state of the art special-effects will never transcend the fact that it's a truly well told story with rounded, developed characters personified by actors giving very good performances. This film is an example to lazy, idea lacking filmmakers everywhere. Even if you are going to do a 'genre' film, have the audacity to take the genre and your ideas seriously so you can elevate your work beyond the limitations of the inherent genre. James Cameron accomplished this task on more than one occasion. Here's a toast to you, Jim!
B000028U0Y|4.0|It is ironic that even though this concert was given at a prison and most of the songs are about being destitute, this recording is fun to listen to. It really helps to have seen the movie, \\"Walk the Line.\\" When you listen to the CD in the context of Cash's life and the reason he played at Folsom, this CD takes on a whole new dimension. I am not usually a fan of Country music, though I have been striving to care less about style and more about content, but this music has a lot of heart. It is not intricate, nor is it ingenious in its conception, but the passion is there. The only annoying thing is that if you are not careful, these songs get stuck in your head, especially \\"Folsom Prison Blues.\\"  <br />
B0002W18MU|5.0|I have been a Johnny Cash fan for many years. I was nearly extatic when the American series came out. Nearly all of the songs in this series feature Johnny playing and singing by himself. One might think that one man - with one guitar and one voice - would be very weak in quality. WRONG!! I've got all five of these albums and also the boxed set, entitled CASH UNEARTHED. If you don't have them, I suggest that you get them ASAP!

B000GFLAI0|4.0|a slight disappointment and more inconsistent than time out of mind and love and theft. despite the praise my fellow reviews have showered on 'workingman's blues #2,' i thought it was the album's weakest. 'spirit on the water,' and 'when the deal goes down' are virtually identical to 'bye and bye' or 'standing in the doorway'--dylan's slow plaints haven't advanced much musically in the last decade. the album is salvaged by the two triumvirates bookending the relatively weak songwriting in tracks #4-7. handles the blues well on 'thunder' and 'the levees gonna break.' 'nettie moore' and 'ain't talkin' are the standout songs. 'nettie moore' is musically the most interesting, set in a key that refuses to pin itself down in major or minor. 'ain't talkin'' is the logical progression from 'love sick' and 'things have changed,' and though it doesn't have the bite and lyrical tightness of either, dylan's excellent band keep it enthralling for all of its 8 1/2 minutes. an incredibly strong work, perhaps the best all year, but still fails to reach the heights of its two immediate predecessors or my personal favorite dylan album, john wesley harding.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I haven't yet finished watching this for the first time... but that could be because it's over FOUR HOURS LONG!  Depending on what kind of live DVD you're used to, this might be a little different.  There aren't any cuts to music videos or behind the scenes.  No crowd surfing (though I'd love to see Mr. LaBrie do that...) and no insane-o lights show.  This concert is exactly what I would expect from them: excellent musicianship without adding in other \\"interests\\" to distract from the music.  It's all meat and no filler.  If you're looking for excellent prog, you've got it.  Conversations with the audience and witty inside jokes?  Nope. <br /> <br />Great job, DT!
B000FIMG68|4.0|Lots of people have derided the second season of Lost as not being as great as the first. Well, that is bound to happen with a show as dense and closely watched as this. We should all remember that, with season 2, there were 'expectations', whereas with Season 1, it was ALL new to us. Now, here comes the sophomore season and we have ideas of where we want the show to go and what we want to happen. With the exception of the Rose and Bernard story, the second season is top notch. Thick, dense, exploratory and different. The biggest difference to me is that the first show takes place over 48 days. The second over just over 2 weeks. Cramming 24 episodes into 18 days is difficult and requires a lot of patience on the part of the viewers.  <br />It's an amazing achievement. <br />That said, I was very disappointed in the extras on this disc. There was nothing truly revelatory. The cute \\"Dharma Initiative\\" presentation of the disc is neat for uber fans, but, who really needs a compilation of Sawyer insults? Or more bloopers? Really? Okay, so people flub their lines occassionally and break character, whoop de doo, show me something Smokey and the Bandit didn't. <br />The \\"connections\\" section was what I was waiting to see and I made myself wait until I had watched all 24 episodes to get there. What a grave disappointment. The graphic of following computer cables from one character to another is a pain and there isn't any easy way to do it. If you make a mistake and want to go back where you came from you MUST watch the accompanying short excerpt. And while it's neat to see Jack and Ana meet at the airport, the 9th time I had to see it kind of pissed me off. It's really hard to navigate and hardly worth the time. <br />Where is the connection between Bernard and the Pilot? We all know from the first season deleted scenes that the Pilot's mother left Bernard before he became a millionaire from selling his business. This is just one of the holes that the DVD extras doesn't fill. <br />The only worthwhile viewing is the documentary on the making of \\"Fire + Water\\", from concept to show. But Abrams is noticeable absent from this episode. <br />Now, granted, I haven't watched the commentary tracks yet, perhaps they are great, but Disc 7 was a waste of my time. <br />But, this is definitely a great show and I don't buy season packages of anything. I choose to spend my money on more worthwhile endeavors than movies I will watch 2x and never see again. Lost is different. As long as the players stay in place for the proposed 5 years, I can see myself holeing up in my house for a week and watching 84 hours of a heckuva well told story.
0140386335|5.0|I can't recall when or why I decided to read this book, but I'm glad I did. I was unfamiliar with the author and the movie, so I really had no idea what to expect. Based on the five stars sitting atop this review, I'm sure you have know problem guessing I liked what I found.   <br />  This author tackled things in this story that he could have really screwed up on, but he handled them with a grace I've rarely seen. Not only that, but he successfully changed the story in a whole new one without making te book seem choppy.  <br />  I wouldn't recommend reading this book if you don't have the time to dedicate the necessary attention to it. This book is so full of genius ideas and concepts, I think everyone should have a clear head to enjoy it to it's fullest potential.
B0002S94OS|1.0|Hi. I am a thrash metal fan. I like to hear the same exact song over and over and over and over, because thats what music is all about. If you don't make it sound the way all the other thrashers are, then that makes me fake. I can't do that now, I must play every riff at 827 miles an hour and scream EVERY lyric in every song to show that I have played 9 hours a day, but in the end it all sounds the same as everyone else anyways, but at least it's \\"real\\" metal, I'm not allowed to be creative.  <br />       For me, it's all about image. The music comes later, I just need to keep in mind that I need to wear a gorry loud black shirt that you could see from space to show how hardcore I am. I only weigh 90 pounds soaking wet in most cases, but I'm wearing a goary shirt and I worship satan so I could say I'm hardcore. <br />    In all reality, this is all an act. I am just a sheep following what all the other metal purists tell me I can like. It kinda sucks though, because I'm not allowed to listen to talented bands like Slipknot, Ill nino, Korn, Staind, or any other HONEST band. Ill just keep worshiping satan and pretending to be hardcore. The biggest thing of all is, I must always keep my mind closed, I am a sheep. Gotta follow the leader.
B000000ORE|5.0|I just bought this album a few days ago at Coconuts [it was the last one] and I have to tell you at first I didnt know if it could match the power of Mechanical Resonance but I think it is just as good or better. I'm overly pleased with it. After hearing how good this album is, it makes me want to get all their albums and by all the great reviews about Tesla I think I might. This record is great and and every song on here is worth a listen. If you want to here great rock instead of all the crap on the radio now, I highly recommend you getting this album the next time you leave the house!

B00008OE4W|5.0|The thing about Sneakers that sets it apart from other heist and hacker flicks is that the movie concentrates on the characters and their motivations more than the technology. This means that while some films soon look antiquated and out of date (\\"Hackers\\" and \\"Wargames\\" immediately comes to mind) Sneakers is grounded in its quirky characters and clever dialog.<br /><br />The supporting actors deserve as much mention as the leads; Eddie Jones, Ben Kingsley, Stephen Tobolowsky and James Earl Jones are all perfectly cast and play their parts brilliantly. For a fun action/comedy with an unparalleled cast you can't get more for your money than \\"Sneakers\\".<br /><br />DVD note: To be honest the directors commentary is pretty weak as far as commentaries go, and the \\"behind the scenes featurette\\" only contains clips from the actual movie, but the movie itself is more than good enough to warrent the purchase of this DVD.

And if you'll take nothing else from this book (which I doubt, but play along), it'll be a long list of his books to check out from the library. <br /> <br />When I read the introduction, I had to laugh. In the tradition of Strunk and White, King decided to omit all unnecessary words and make this book as slim as possible. I guess only Stephen King could consider 300 pages a slim volume. Did he succeed at taking out all unnecessary words? Well, I guess that would depend on whether you really need to know how he wiped his bottom with poison ivy once as a child. Personally, I think all the childhood stuff was a bit worthless to the point of his book and its readers. But aside from that, I thought the book was entertaining and a fast, plesant read. That's a shocker for a writing guide. Of course, King never claimed to make a how-to manual. He's just giving us a few tips for the road. <br /> <br />Reading through On Writing, I found great gems of writing advice. But I do disagree with some of his advice. King refers to writing as digging out a fossil. As you write, more of the fossil will appear. He discourages plotting for this reason. Well, it's nice that King can come up with an idea, sit down at his computer and \\"discover\\" the other 400 pages of it. But he needs to realize that some of us need to bring tools to the dig, and one of those tools is an outline or plot. For most begining writers, trying to write from an idea alone will result in a 100 page winding manuscript that fizzles out from underdevelopment. And King offers no advice on how to fix that. <br /> <br />I would recomend those to any who have an inkling to write, however small. Whether you're dazzled by King's advice, or decide on a different path-- you won't feel as if you wasted your time. King has earned his reputation as a master. And let's face it, the guy is fun.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|The atmosophere, musical score and special effects in Silent Hill were just great.  The writing was weak, though, and the story and acting suffer as a result.  While it was a whole lot of fun to watch, it would have been much cooler if the storyline had produced the kind of \\"jump out of your seat\\" suspense that I experienced watching \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"Signs\\". <br /> <br />Still, it was definitely worth the $4 rental fee and 2 hours on a Friday night!
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I can almost hear Leon Redbone singing these songs, instead of Bob. This is a perfect 2AM album. One of Bob's best. <br /> <br />- Vinny Marino
B000FGGE68|3.0|I thought the movie ok.  I didn't know anything about the character(s) before watching the movie, so my expectations weren't that high.  The action was fast paced, lots of interesting gadgets, and explosions.  The fight scenes were good too.  The story itself lost me at times, it didn't hold my attention.
0061020710|4.0|Good, light hearted read. A fantasy parody by an author who can write. Nothing deep. A few belly laughs. The first third was the best.
078681859X|5.0|Even though this book is probably written for young teens, it's still a great book for adults.  Well written and fun to read.
B000301YY8|5.0|I had heard Beautiful on the radio but never really paid attention.  Then, last year, I saw him on Oprah and became a fan.  He has a great personality and his live performances are so sincere and beautful.  I immediately bought the album and was not disappointed. <br /> <br />My favorites are Goodbye My Lover (the slower version), Beautiful, High, So Long Jimmy, and Sugar Coated (from Chasing Time). <br /> <br />All the songs are really good.  Buy it already!
B00005JMFQ|1.0|If you think cussing Brits and gratuitous nudity are cute, then this is your movie.  The problem here is that these actors and writers *actually* believe that they are cute and witty.  Incredible, really.  The result is a steaming bucket of excrement. <br /> <br />I have some burning questions: <br /> <br />1. Will Hugh Grant ever take on a role in which he portrays someone other than himself? <br /> <br />2. Will the Brits ever get over their fascination with the word f*ck? <br /> <br />3. If people have so much money that a piece of garbage like this can *actually* be funded, may I have some please?  I'll do some good with it.
B000059S9D|5.0|I will do my best to avoid being my usual long-winded self and give it to you as simply as possible: First there was Blackfield, the offshoot of PT consisting of Steve and Israeli musician Aviv Geffen. An outstanding CD of PT-like songs, but of shorter length and leaning more toward radio-friendly territory, yet progressive & other-worldly nonetheless. Then came my being turned onto the Tree, by my same friend who turned me on to Blackfield. I, a self-professed prog rock fiend for the last 37 years, am in awe of this band's music. If, like me, you are a fan of all the Giants--YES, Pink Floyd, Gabriel-era Genesis, The Moody Blues (1967-1972), ELP, PFM, King Crimson & Pulsar--you owe it to your bad self to familiarize yourself with PT's music immediately. At the same time I was introduced to this stunning disc, I was also initiated with Deadwing, Sky Moves Sideways and Signify. ALL MASTERPIECES. (Date of being turned on: August 28, 2006. Thanks, Brian.) Steven Wilson is gifted beyond words--great songwriter, beautiful singing voice. The song on this disc that REALLY grabbed me, though--and motivated me to write this review--was \\"Where We Would Be.\\" This is yet another one of those songs that are so beautiful that these words do it no justice. I have to listen to it several times before I can move on to the next track. The multi-tracked acoustic 6 and 12 string guitars, Steve's singing, the soft background percussion...par excellance. Listen to the words...especially if you've come out on the bad end of a terminated relationship. If there's not a lump in your throat and/or a tear in your eye after hearing this song, report to the nearest emergency room and have yourself checked for a pulse. Steve and his cohorts are among the prog rock demigods of the new century, and they have my undying respect & admiration. Absolutely WOW from start to finish.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I have a lot of Johnny Cash CDs with music from his entire career. This is one of the best.  His voice is weak, but more than ever before he sings from the heart: about love and death, memories and regrets. There are perhaps greater individual songs on other albums--probably none of these has the power of \\"Hurt,\\" for instance--but overall this is a masterpiece.
B000G759LW|4.0|My husband hates pop music but he actually likes this album.  I am still getting used to it.  Some songs I loved immediately and some I don't really care for.  Most of it is definitely set in an older style.<br /><br />My favorites are Candyman, Hurt, and Save Me From Myself.  I also really like Ain't No Other Man, Slow Down Baby, Understand, Oh Mother, Nasty Naughty Boy, and Still Dirty.  I HATE the track Thank You.  It is annoying and pointless.  The other songs that I didn't mention haven't grown on me yet.<br /><br />One Complaint:  I think this album should have been put on one cd.  There are really not enough songs for a double disc.  Shania released a single cd with about 20 complete songs.  That is how this should have been.  Otherwise, I like it.  Highly Recommended....Buy It Right Now!
019812919X|5.0|This is _the_ edition of Shakespeare's works for serious readers.  All other modern editions change Shakespeare's actual words (or as close as we can get to them) to make them easier for readers unwilling to familiarize themselves with Shakespeare's language.  It's not the easiest edition of Shakespeare to read, but it is the best, edited carefully by some of the best scholars in the field.  Readers acquainted with Middle English will probably be able to manage fairly easily, though occasional reference to an edition with annotations may be necessary.<br /><br />  It's a shame that this edition is no longer available, though it shows up used from time to time.  If you're unable to obtain it, an edition of the First Folio is probably the best alternative, though its lack of editing and dramatis personæ will present some difficulty.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|After two listens my favorite songs are clearly \\"Working Man's Blues\\", \\"Ain't Talkin\\", \\"Nettie Moore\\", \\"Spirit on the Water\\" and \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\".  Only \\"Working Man..\\" and \\"Ain't Talking\\" have a shot to join the classics.  I have everything he has done and must admit that he is my Favorite musical artist (with Bach, Bartok, and the Beatles).  I don't know why!  I'd put this just below \\"Love and Theft\\" and \\"Time Out of Mind\\", but still top notch Dylan.  Two general comments:  1) the sound is much softer than the two previous studio albums-less edge; 2) it is the most upbeat of the three.<br /><br />I have to find out what he's been eatin'. This good at 65 ain't right-just ain't right...
B00006GFAB|4.0|With Gene Simmons making his debut this last year on Cable TV with Rock School on MTV and again this year on A&E with Family Album, I'm sure a few newcommers to the Kiss legacy will be looking to see what the King of Tongue has done besides get into the Guiness Book of World Records.  Truth be told as much as this collection is a good intro to the bands studio works, Kiss is by all means first a show band and second a musical band.  But non the less they still in their history outplayed themselves on the stage far more than they ever did in the studio.  Having seen them myself twice in Detriot during their hayday I'd have to say get \\"Alive\\" first as Kiss is definately meant to be heard live and not on a studio record.  If your new to Kiss you won't be disappointed at buying \\"Alive\\" and you'll get a much better idea about what all the rave was about with the band in the 70's more than what you will from this compilation.
B00006G8HX|4.0|If you've seen Star Trek II then you know, as Spock would say, \\"Logical\\" for a sequel to follow. This one ties up the loose ends and answers any questions or speculations one had at the end of The Wrath of Khan. Leonard Nimoy behind the camera this time, we follow a skeleton crew on the Enterpise in search of the friend who sacrificed his life to save theirs. Information concerning the Genesis project has fallen into the wrong hands; Klingons. Christopher Lloyd is excellent in the role of the Klingon commander. A battle ensues, and as usual, Kirk resorts to unconventional matters to save the day.  <br /> <br />A beautiful score by James Horner enhances my viewing pleasure.  <br /> <br />The special features included with the DVD provide a lot of insight into the Star Trek world.  A must have if you are a Trekker.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I'm happy with my Star Wars trilogy Special Letterbox Collector's Edition from 1992 on VHS. It has the true original releases in widescreen, just like it was in theatres. What more do I need? <br /> <br />Why would I buy yet ANOTHER version of the \\"Special Editions\\"? What a waste. I'll just deal with VHS format. Who cares. With all the rendering Lucas has done with his 400 different releases of the film, I wouldn't even be surprised if he \\"fixed\\" parts of the so called 'original versions' on the DVDs.  <br /> <br />If you really want to sit down and watch these movies as they are supposed to be, play it safe, buy the original trilogy on vhs BEFORE Lucas got it into his head to change everything. <br /> <br />All the new renditions over the years has turned these filmed into a wish washed mess.  <br /> <br />George Lucas is an idiot.
0778321606|3.0|Cancer survivor Lydia Hoffman opens a yarn shop on Blossom Street. In order to attract customers, she decides to hold knitting classes, with a baby blanket being the first project. Three people sign up, all with different reasons for being there. Unhappily married Jacqueline Donovan dislikes her new pregnant daughter-in-law, Tammie Lee, but decides to knit the baby blanket to show her son she is making an effort to accept his new wife. Carol Girard desperately wants a baby, but has been unable to conceive and is about to undergo her third and final IVF procedure. When she sees the sign for knitting a baby blanket, she takes it as a good omen and joins the class. Alix Townsend had a rough upbringing, has had a bit of trouble with the law, and is living from paycheck to paycheck. Although she can barely afford it, she decides to sign up for the knitting classes because she can donate the blanket to charity and use it against her court ordered community service hours. Lydia is a bit concerned that these totally different women won't get along, but they all become close in ways none of them imagined.<br /><br />\\"The Shop on Blossom Street\\" was a funny, but light read, what I call cotton candy for the brain. Of the four characters I liked Lydia and Alix the best. Lydia's troubled relationship with her sister and the affect the cancer has had on her life, especially in her relationships, were interesting. The story of Alix's troubled childhood makes her a sympathetic character and readers will want her to succeed in her relationship with youth minister Jordan Turner. Carol's struggle to have a child is heartbreaking, although I found her character to be a bit bland. I found Jacqueline to be a stereotypical rich, shallow person at first, concerned only with her standing in society, but her character grew on me by the end of the book.<br /><br />Debbie Macomber's story telling ability is her strong point. She creates characters that you care about and readers will eagerly turn the pages to find out what happens to them. Unfortunately at times she resorts to cliched characters like Jacqueline, which is a shame when the other three characters are so believable and likable. Some of the plots in this book are also cliched and one particular plot, involving Alix and her roommate, was too convenient and totally unbelievable.<br /><br />\\"The Shop on Blossom Street\\" is a nice but fluffy read.rly turn the pages to find out what happens to them.

B0000683DH|5.0|I can and have watched this movie time and time again since its theatrical release in 1982. I have seen it so many times, in fact, I practically can recite all the dialog along with the characters. The Director's Edition provides additional scenes for me to memorize. It is an excellent follow up to the Space Seed episode on the original TV series. The battle of wits between Admiral Kirk and Khan provides lots of 'final frontier' action. A young Kirstie Alley, in her first role, is very convincing as a Vulcan StarFleet officer under the tutelage of Captain Spock.  Although, I know the outcome, the climax saddens me each time I watch it. The final scene, however,  lets us know that all is well.  Highly recommended for any Star Trek fan or anyone who enjoys good sci-fi action.
B000009RNM|5.0|Any single-disc compilation of David Bowie's best songs seems doomed to fail. His career is so long and varied that something is bound to be left out or un(der)represented.  1990's Changesbowie did a good job of covering the hits from \\"Space Oddity\\" to \\"Blue Jean\\", and 2002's Best of Bowie added \\"Under Pressure\\" and tacked on a few non-essential items to bring it up to date (1997, in that case). Both of these collections made for entertaining listens, but incomplete pictures. Bowie the pop star, in both cases, was emphasized over Bowie the artist.<br /><br />Fortunately, EMI recognized in 1997 that these two sides of David Bowie were not mutually exclusive, and decided to issue the pertinent songs alongside one another on two separate discs covering the first decade of his career. Although two discs may be less buyer friendly, it is really the only way to do justice to an artist like Bowie, as he has a plethora of hits, album cuts, and B-sides that rank among his best songs. And it was wise to separately issue two individual CDs, as the material from each \\"era\\" adheres to different sets of artistic criteria. The individual discs help keeps the songs separate in the listener's mind, and thus have a clearer perspective of what Bowie was shooting for as his career progressed.<br /><br />The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974 is a pi&ntilde;ata of tracks from the first half-dozen years of his recording career. It contains all of his most enduring radio classics from the early days: \\"The Jean Genie\\", \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", \\"Rebel Rebel\\", \\"Suffragette City\\", and \\"Changes\\". These are great songs, of course, but there are fourteen other songs on the disc, most of which are of at least equal quality. Some have become well-known through the years in spite of not being radio favorites, such as \\"Starman\\" and the ghostly \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\", which had recently - at the time of this compilation's release -  been a highlight of Nirvana's MTV Unplugged performance.  There is also a generous helping of album tracks, among which are two more from Hunky Dory (\\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" and \\"Life On Mars?\\"), one from Ziggy Stardust (\\"Rock & Roll Suicide\\"), four more from Aladdin Sane, and a live version of the title track from Diamond Dogs.<br /><br />And the gems don't end there. The remarkable glam-rock B-sides \\"John, I'm Only Dancing\\" and \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" are here, as is his version of his own \\"All the Young Dudes\\". Finally, there is the superb interpretation of the one-hit wonder \\"Sorrow\\", from his underrated Pin-Ups CD. (This definitely beats out his cover of \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" in terms of being worthy of inclusion on a best-of.) Overall, there are no glaring omissions whatsoever from this collection, maybe just some fans' personal faves. 1969/1974 does a perfect job of demonstrating what a versatile, prolific, and entertaining performer Bowie was from almost day one. And with the time frame that it covers, it reminds one that he achieved all of this in a mere 6 years.us helping of album tracks, among which are two more from Hunky Dory (\\"Oh!

B00005JLEJ|5.0|Kagemusha is my eighth Kurosawa DVD and it holds #1 position in my collection. Kurosawa was a painter before he became a cinematographer, then writer and director, and his artistic background is evident in the use of color and perspective in this film. It is a treat for the eyes.<br /><br />The film differs from Ran, the director's wonderful version of King Lear, in that it is a drama built around historical records and tradition.It is a compelling story that left me emotionally spent at the end.<br /><br />The first time I watched the DVD, I played the Japanese audio track and read the English subtitles. This was not at all difficult, for the subtitles are clearly visible in all scenes. The second time through the DVD, I turned on the English commentary and watched the action on screen as everything was explained to me in marvelous detail. My third time through the DVD was with the Japaenese audio, and a greatly improved understanding of what was going on, especially the nuanced moments.<br /><br />Color quality and cinematography are magninficent. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Samarai films and/or the work of Akira Kurosawa.
0780021150|4.0|When discussing the merits of a \\"classic\\" film, it's almost heresy to point out that not every movie-goer is a budding film historian or critic.  Students of \\"film\\" rave about Fritz Lang's \\"M\\" for its innovative camera work, semi-scandalous subject matter, and perhaps most of all, the casting of film legend Peter Lorre in his first film as the legendary serial killer of children. <br /> <br />There is an awful lot in \\"M\\" that holds up, even after the passing of 75 years.  The use of seemingly-innocent images to suggest murder, the twisting of the \\"Peer Gynt Suite\\" into a dark melody of terror, the inter-changing shots of the police and criminal gangs tracking down the murderer, and the ambiguous, ominous ending all seem fresh and new.  Peter Lorre's performance was one for the ages, and you can see the germ of so many of his later creepy characters in his pathetic killer. <br /> <br />But to be honest, there is a lot in \\"M\\" that will turn off the casual movie fan.  For one, this is one of the first \\"talkie\\" movies, so the sound quality is not very good - even by German standards, voices are often harsh and clipped.  There's also quite a bit of damage to the film, so there are quite a few hiccups in the film, and there's a white bar across the top of the screen for a major chunk of the movie.  Again, when you appreciate what \\"M\\" is in film terms, that's not so bad, but it will be enough (as I can attest from personal experience showing \\"M\\" to friends) to turn off the occasional casual movie fan.   <br /> <br />The DVD is excellent, with high-quality sub-titles and a good recapture of the restored film.  Someone needs to explain to my why \\"Color Bars\\" are a special feature on the DVD, however.  <br /> <br />To my mind, \\"M\\" is an amazing film.  But it helps to understand its place in film history to enjoy it, and unfortunately not everyone is a major-league cinemaphile.  Check it out, but be wary of showing it to your friends if they aren't die-hard film buffs - they may think you've lost it.
B000F4PD7G|2.0|I certainly take my hat off the the cast for living through the shooting of this one: one message this film gets across big style is that Iceland is mind-buggeringly cold, inhospitable place, and that's just in the Autumn. Sadly, however, Gerard Butler and company's sacrifice in wading through mud, icy rivers and horizontal sleet is spent all in the name of ... well, if truth be told, a fairly humdrum sword and sorcery treatment.<br /><br />Gunnarson describes Beowulf as the oldest piece of literature in the English language, and it's a pity he didn't leave it well alone (there's a good reason literature survives 1500 years). Instead, the script undermines the linear hero myth which Beowulf helped create - a straight fight between good and evil - by giving Grendel a moral basis, namely vengeance for the Danes' killing of his father. In the original, Grendel was simply angered by the Danes' loud and boozy singing! Butler's Beowulf is converted, therefore, into a confused and decidely post modern sort of a hero, one who isn't really sure who he's fighting, why, or what the hell is really going on. I don't think this was a particularly smart variation from the original plot.<br /><br />Save for the airfares to Iceland, the budget is staggeringly low: the cast seems to number about eight (then again, it's quite conceivable the remainder fled to the airport after the first day of principal photography), and are obliged to gallivant around on undoubtedly hardy but all the same squat little Icelandic ponies; this equine inadequacy, together with several other establishing and action shots, calling unfortunately to mind Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br /><br />Whilst given the conditions I suppose they could hardly be blamed, there is still a marked reluctance to indulge in second takes, to the point where at least one take of a combatant beginning to bleed before being stabbed and a take of Hrothgar's queen attempting to storm icily off, only to stumble clumsily over some tussock, make the final edit of the film.<br /><br />Nor are make up, special effects or editing much to write home about: action scenes are clumsily cut and gore and clearly rubber limbs, heads etc. are unconvincingly sprayed around, particularly towards the end.<br /><br />There are some positives: the scenery is certainly momentous and moody, and Gerard Butler is a charismatic and convincing lead, but all in all it isn't surprising this one didn't take off at the box office, and in the final analysis the fact I had to order the DVD from Amazon Canada (it being an Icelanding-Canadian co-production), with neither the US nor the UK carrying the film, kind of figures.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonover some tussock, make the final edit of the film. <br /> <br />Nor are make up, special effects or editing much to write home about: action scenes are clumsily cut and gore and clearly rubber limbs, heads etc. are unconvincingly sprayed around, particularly towards the end. <br /> <br />There are some positives: the scenery is certainly momentous and moody, and Gerard Butler is a charismatic and convincing lead, but all in all it isn't surprising this one didn't take off at the box office, and in the final analysis the fact I had to order the DVD from Amazon Canada (it being an Icelanding-Canadian co-production), with neither the US nor the UK carrying the film, kind of figures. <br /> <br />Olly Buxton
0312938640|5.0|Harry Bosch delves into the/his past to come to terms with his mother's murder that happened 33 years ago.  He gets pretty aggressive and clever at digging out facts that might help him find the killer.  If you enjoy whodunits: use the facts and think it through to get the killer, it should be fairly satisfying.    I was more interested in the character than in solving the crime, but both are intriguing.  Harry becomes increasingly lovable and a surprising romance is delightful.  Just enough to set off the imagination.  Even better, the new love interest isn't tossed aside (but I do not know if she resurfaces again in future MC novels).  I like MC's overall philosophy, which comes out in his writing.    Two MC books read so far (Lincoln Lawyer is the other one).  Still, saw a formula and these books were years apart.  I'll be reading more for sure.

B000BTJDGC|4.0|It is d*mn near impossible to scare me, but this movie temporarily crossed the threshold! A deep inside look into the spiritual realm! Laura Linney was great.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse may never escape the \\"next Radiohead\\" stigma, but that has not stopped them from evolving as a band, and let's face it, they are now closer to being the \\"old Radiohead\\" than Radiohead themselves. This has been cemented over the past three albums, all of which have been fantastic, and \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" marks their most accomplished work to date.<br /><br />Their last album, \\"Absolution,\\" pushed their bombastic and apocalyptic sound to the Nth degree, which made for an exciting and wildly unpredictable listen the first spin. \\"Black Holes...\\" is clearly more dancy and eclectic, banking on synthesizers and distorted guitars to produce a sound that is mixes Muse's trademark sound with that of classic New Order. The first single \\" Supermassive Black Hole\\" is a great example of this new sound, while \\"Map of the Problematique,\\" \\"Knights of Cydonia,\\" and \\"Assasin\\" are all great floor-fillers. Having said that, Muse's strength on this album is their slower, more melodic tracks. The forthcoming single \\"Starlight\\" is an absolute masterpiece, and great accompanying tracks like \\"Invincible\\" and \\"Hoodoo\\" would have made excellent Jeff Buckley songs.<br /><br />Being a huge fan of Muse, a new album from them is always an exciting prospect, and I have yet to be disappointed. While still only known in selective circles in Canada, I imagine that \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" will push their stock up even further. For people new to the band, this is the best place to start.
B000BNX3AU|3.0|It got a little predictive at the end, but the beginning and middle was good. Is it me, or does Diane Lane favor Jennifer Lopez. She might even look like a mature, better model of her. :-)
B000058983|5.0|Honestly, I think that time has done alot for this album. Think about this: The Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" was a huge departure for them when originally released; so much so that Capitol showed their lack of confidence in the record by releasing \\"The Best of The Beach Boys\\" at around the same time, and without a single track from \\"Pet Sounds.\\" Needless to say, with their own record company helping to kill it; here in the U.S. \\"Pet Sounds\\" sold poorly in terms of Beach Boys record sales, while the compilation package reached the top 10. Similarly, comparisons with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Forever Changes\\" are like comparing a luxury car to a scooter, not due to content-although I personally find \\"Forever Changes\\" a much more essential and enjoyable listen than \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or \\"Pet Sounds,\\" and I really like \\"Pet Sounds,\\" can't say the same for \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"-but due to the popularity (or lack of) of the two groups.       If you can take yourself back to 1967 and make an appraisal of all popular music, you come to realize that alot was going on musically at that time. The scene was still reeling from Dylan and The Beatles happening, a one-off garage band stood as good a chance of having a number one record nationally as did a tried and true work horse act like The Ventures, or even the two mentioned above. All the different \\"types\\" of rock 'n' roll that didn't have a name yet were present, and making the charts; maybe not the upper reaches of the charts, but their records were being played on the radio and bought-and the charts reflected that. The \\"types\\" of performers that existed at that time were numerous! Folk rock (The Byrds; Barry McGuire; Mamas and Papas; Lovin' Spoonful and numerous others), Country rock (Lewis and Clark Epidition; The Charlatans and numerous others), Soul (Wilson Pickett; Sam & Dave; Aretha Franklin; Otis Redding and numerous others), Easy rock (The New Colony Six; Classics IV and numerous others) Female singers (Petula Clark; Lesley Gore; Dionne Warwick and numerous others), Girl groups were still with us. The Chiffons were still releasing records for the Laurie label at that time, and getting air-play. Meanwhile, The Angels had jumped ship at Smash records and were being released by RCA. Doo-Wop was still around, The Jive Five had a hit with \\"I'm A Happy Man\\" in 1965. Bubblegum (The Cowsills; 1910 Fruitgum Company; Ohio Express and numerous others), Male singers (Roy Orbison; Gene Pitney; B.J. Thomas and numerous others), Just over-all feel good music that's a little more difficult to pigeon-hole (The 5th Dimension and numerous others), Psychedelic (The Grateful Dead; Blues Magoos; Strawberry Alarm Clock and numerous others), simple, straight ahead rock 'n' roll (The Rascals; Tommy James and the Shondells and numerous others), Duos (Sonny and Cher; James and Bobby Purify; Peaches and Herb; The Righteous Brothers and numerous others), the Southern California sound (Beach Boys; Gary Lewis and the Playboys; Paul Revere and the Raiders and numerous others). Acts like Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass; Vikki Carr; Bobbie Gentry; and Glen Campbell were making the rock charts as well, some of them selling in huge numbers! Tex-Mex (Sir Douglas Quintet; The Premiers; Sam The Sham and The Pharaohs and numerous others), Baroque pop (The Left Banke). And let's not forget The Monkees and Motown. Then there was the British invasion with all of their different \\"types!\\" Among all of this was Love, whose only national chart success was \\"7 & 7 Is\\" (peaked at #33) from the \\"Da Capo\\" album. Conversely, at the top of all of this was The Beatles, who by Ringo Starr's own admission \\"could've walked on stage and farted\\" and gotten applause!       When you really take a good look at what was going on with music at that time, it's easy to see how some bands were simply missed. True, Love did make the national charts with one 45, yet it's peak showing and their failure to reach the top 40 again (at that time, chart success was determined by 45 sales more so than album sales, any 45 that made the top 40 was considered a hit) would have nearly deemed them a failure at the time. Would anyone outside of L.A. even have noticed \\"Forever Changes?\\" No, they probably wouldn't have. Time has revealed that there was so much great stuff being recorded and released (particularly from around 1965-1967 or '68) that the public simply couldn't keep up. It's taken decades for alot of the music made for large and local companies during those years to either see the light of day or reach an audience. In the case of \\"Forever Changes,\\" the loyalty has grown over time, literally year-by-year. It really is like cream rising to the top of a jug of milk! When pure (unpasturized) milk is put into a clear jug, at first you don't see the cream, you just see milk. Eventually the milk and the cream separate, with the cream rising to the top of the jug, and the separation becomes clearly visible. When this album was first emptied onto the market, virtually nobody saw it, nearly no one noticed. Over time, more and more people have come to notice it, and most of us who have discovered it enjoy it tremendously, just like a cat enjoying the cream from the top of that milk jug! And I'm sure that if anyone would try in any way to detract from this album's value, we'd fight for it as vigorously as that cat would if you would take its dish away as it's drinking. We appreciate the cream of the music that has been created over the years, and this album and those who created it stand head and shoulders over the bulk of history's recorded musical legacy! It's weathered the tough sands of time and has come through unscathed, in fact sounding bright, shiny and new. It deserves the place it has earned!

B00005JOQS|4.0|I know that Christopher Reeves will always be remembered as Superman, but we should atleast give this movie a shot. These are new times with new technologies. Let's view the experience with an open, unbiased mind. I think there should be a new Superman movie every 2 years. I thought Tom Welling was going to be Superman though. Anyhow i still loved it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Actually, this is the second time I've purchased this album. I liked mine so much that I wanted to share it with a friend in Romania but I was unwilling to give up my copy of it. Norah Jones has that sultry, soothing voice that I can just submerse myself in; and yes, this album is good enough to keep and give as a gift too.
B00002ND77|5.0|This movie was disrespected so much by hollywood. They are so racist. how could you give Denzel an Oscar for Training Day when it couldn't even sit on the same shelf as this movie. Malcolm X needs to be seen by every American, whether white or black!
B00005NVDF|4.0|you can get the specifics from other reviews. here is my take. <br /> <br />This is the middle part of a tripple feature. <br /> <br />First Watch Casablanca - it doesn't come any better than that <br />then <br />Watch Play it again Sam. the Bogart impersonator that talks to Woody does a good job. Woody is a movie buff. He plays a movie critic without any stretch. Diane Keaton is her awesome self. The dialogue with Casablanca as a reference is poignant and funny. <br />Then <br />Watch When Harry Met Sally. You'll be glad you did. it also has references to Casablanca.
B000056H5J|4.0|Its almost 5 years after the 9/11 attacks.  Throughout the past five years \\"Only Time\\" has played many times.  Still I find it hard to get past the end of the song without tears in my eyes and profound sadness I feel.  For many, may be a song of healing.  It has an opposite affect on me (don't know why).  Currently I want to put together a moving slide show of the life and times of the Twin Towers.  I think the song is perfect for my project and would be a emotionally touching tribute instead of rehashing the awfulness connected to the event.  The slide show will only show the photos of the beginnings of the construction to pictures of the views and the beautiful years they existed. No scenes of the attacks will be included, theres already venues for that.  Lastly, I hope there are some pretty pan shots over the tops of the WTC. The end of the slide show (and song) will fade and the WTC will re-appear proud and tall.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|You hold your breath these days when there is an announcement that Bob Dylan is releasing a CD. It could be significant or it could be on the order of his take on \\"Arthur McBride.\\" Fortunately, this is beyond significant and one of the best CDs of his career. The spectre of mortality is closing in on him, and so he minces few words in getting to the heart of the issues addressed on this record. I am still digesting this and finding nuances and subtleties to give pause for consideration. <br />From the opening and ominous \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" to the final bars of the CD, Dylan takes on the perilous political and social quagmires that our take on society is now mired in. He is warning all who would listen that the tar flats are congealing, time is running out, and personal love offers only a respite, not a redemption.  <br />This is a better Cd than TIME OUT OF MIND,  and that should tell you all you need to know. It is recorded with his travelling band, and so is more cohesive than anything he's done since the days with the Band. Stylistically, he actually reminds me of The Beatles post 1968: there are hints of the 30's, rural blues, rock, apocalyptic folk, and pure Dylan all the way. All that seems missing are harmonies from George Harrison or Johnny Cash.  <br />The DVD offers a brief glimpse of Dylan on stage these days. It's well worth the extra bucks. <br />Alright, I am going back to listen to this again....
B000B8QEYC|2.0|Enya has such a lovely voice. I have truly enjoyed her music, but this CD was a big disappointment. It seemed to stray from her roots. Enya's music has always taken me to my Celtic roots, but this CD was too much pop.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|this is michael in his hayday... when we were still tryin to get to know him as an artist and a person. he was at the top of his game when THRILLER was released... its still doing great today. i kno this is crazy but this is one of the few albums ever that if it breaks or scratches ill buy another one. i have owned 9 THRILLER albums!!! and im 22 years old. <br /> <br />honestly my favourite track he has ever done is 'wanna be startin' somethin'. i love this song to death. the musical arrangement, the words, the choir at the end. just brilliance throughout the whole song. great way to start the record. <br /> <br />another bangers on the album are 'P.Y.T.' 'baby be mine'.  he definatley shows his funky side on these songs.   <br /> <br />Honestly there is not one song on this album that i dont like more than the other... the only song i am not fond of is 'beat it' its a great song but i dont feel it like all the other songs.  <br /> <br />this special edition is alright it has a couple of songs on it: 'carosel' and 'someone in the dark'. there are great songs but im kind of glad they did not make the album. and there are a bunch of interviews with quincy jones that show no revelance to the album at all.  i just wanna hear the album not interview about how the album was being made. <br /> <br />but other than that lackluster. this is one of the greatest albums EVER MADE.  <br /> <br />5 stars out of 5 for the album <br />1.2 stars out 5 stars for the special edition lackluster
0452270073|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by regeneration. What I thought would be another \\"war book\\" turned out to have heart, as well as an interesting story line. Tired of the romanticizing of war that often goes along with these depictions of World War I, I loved the way the different patients' gruesome stories of war weaved together. I was most intrigued by Dr. Rivers and his fear that the emotionally painful work he is doing with his patients will not pay off in the end but will have caused more damage to them.

As a constant reader, I find that thinner books offer so much more than larger books.  Why?  Thinner books condense information into easy to understand rules, laws, and principles.  Al Ries breaks down the rules of successful marketing down to just 22 laws, and he does a great job of explaining each.  How much easier can that be?  And you only need to remember just a few of them to market successfully.  And though this book was not written to tell you exactly how you are going to make your product sell more, it will tell you your goals and destinations.

B0008JIJ2E|5.0|\\"The Karate Kid\\" could have been 80s drivel, a nonsensical teen movie with very little redeeming qualities. Fortunately, \\"Kid\\" rises far above that, being not only an underdog story like \\"Rocky\\" (also from director John Avildsen)but also a companionship story and a bit of a love story.  Rumor has it that the screenwriter wrote the script after seeing an article in the local paper about a teenage boy who defended himself against bullies by taking karate.  A very simple concept, and yet one that works for several reasons.  First, everyone can relate to the underdog story.  Daniel's discomfort over moving away from home (New Jersey) to go across country to California, at a very crucial time in his life (high school) is not foreign to any of us.  All of us have been in this position, in some form, at one time or another.  Daniel is desperate to fit in, in a place where as a darkheaded Italian, he sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb around blonde Californians.  A bit stereotypical, yes, but effective.  The girl of his dreams is blonde and he meets her on the beach.  His arch-nemesis is blonde, \\"hunky\\" in the teen sense, wealthy and does all the right things.  The complete opposite of Daniel, who rides a bike and whose mom drives an old olive green station wagon with the embarrassing habit of stalling in wealthy neighborhoods.  With so much stacked against him, we want Daniel to win. <br />Second, the casting makes it work.  This was a relatively \\"little\\" film with a minor budget.  No big names, no movie stars.  Ralph Macchio gives a breakout performance as Daniel; Pat Morita is so perfect as his mentor and friend, Mr. Miyagi, could anyone else have ever played this part?  Elisabeth Shue, as the girl of Daniel's dreams, gives Ali enough real qualities that she doesn't come across as a cardboard cutout that Daniel is pining for.  William Zabka always seemed to play the bully in 80s movies and for good reason.  His Johnny is cocky, smarmy and inflated with his own self-importance, not to mention a large amount of hostility toward outsiders. <br />Thirdly, and most importantly, this movie works so well and is such a classic because of the chemistry between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi.  This movie is really about more than just karate, although karate is a large part of it.  It's really about the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Both are completely alien to the other in the beginning, they both eye each other warily, the boy from New Jersey and the older man from Japan.  Soon, Mr. Miyagi becomes Daniel's savior, then his mentor and finally, his best friend.  It's a sweet and touching metamorphosis and more of a \\"love story\\" than the storyline involving Ali, which seems to be more of an \\"opposites attract\\" thing. <br />Regardless, the conclusion of the film at the karate tournament is spectacular, akin to the final bout in \\"Rocky\\".  Is there any question as to what the outcome is or should be?  Of course not, but the journey of getting there is all the fun. <br />\\"Karate Kid\\" is more than worthy to adding to your home library and a feel-good film that benefits being watched again and again.  Highly recommended.    <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000E33VWW|5.0|I really had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch this film...I hadn't read \\"In Cold Blood\\" and had only a fleeting memory of Truman Capote...This is the kind of movie that reminds me of the proverbial \\"book you can't put down.\\" <br /> <br />Artfully crafted, impeccibly acted, entirely deserving of the Oscar for Leading Man... <br /> <br />I had to go read the book within days...and have to say, I'm glad I saw the film first...it made the experience of reading the book that much richer...because all you think of is the character never mentioned in the book...Capote himself.
1594200653|1.0|Englishman Tony Judt's POSTWAR is an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking: to give a coherent account of the history of Europe from 1945. The outline of events is well known: a continent in ruins at the end of the Second World War, the miraculous rise of Western Europe from the wreckage, the concurrent enslavement of the East, and thence the titanic struggle between the two world systems, culminating in the triumph of liberal democracy over totalitarian state control. It is a great story, surely one of the finest chapters in the history of human civilization. <br /> <br />Judt seems to take the view (with which most people would likely agree) that great shifts in history ultimately rest upon the underlying economics. In the big picture, Communism failed because it was unproductive, capitalism succeeded because it was the opposite. The question he asks is a good one: why did it happen when it did? Why, after having survived so long (since 1917, in the case of the Soviets) did the Eastern Block suddenly collapse at the end of the eighties, and so rapidly?  <br /> <br />His answer is, astonishingly, the Helsinki Accords. \\"Against all expectation,\\" he claims, \\"it [Brezhnev's signing of the Helsinki Accords] was to prove mortal.\\" (p. 503). The argument here seems to be that by having agreed to the Helsinki Accords (which included some boilerplate language on human rights), the Communist leaders were thereafter hamstrung in suppressing those dissidents who dressed their opposition in terms of human rights rather than as political attacks against the Party. <br /> <br />He thus attributes the collapse of Communism to the role of dissenters within the non-Soviet Eastern Block countries. Judt seems not to have grasped that these countries were just the playing field, not the actual players. He refers to himself as having been in Czechoslovakia at this time; perhaps this is why he seems to think that the minor protest groups within the Soviet satellites were something other than marginal--as causal agents rather than benefactors of larger forces. In this book, Vaclav Havel plays a far greater role than Ronald Reagan in the collapse of Communism. In fact the name \\"Reagan\\" itself only appears a dozen or so times--in other words, it is rarely cited, and then usually in the off-hand manner with which those who wish they had influence dismiss those who do. (Reagan's speech at the Berlin Wall is not even mentioned, something hard to fathom in an 800-page history of postwar Europe.) <br /> <br />Eventually, the anti-American streak which runs through this book from the beginning emerges into plain sight: \\"But it should not be concluded...that it was American encouragement or support which precipitated or facilitated their [Eastern Europe's] liberation.\\" (p. 631) and then later, equally bluntly, \\"...[despite] the self-congratulatory narrative that has entered the American public record, Washington did not `bring down' Communism, Communism imploded of its own accord.\\" (p. 659.) <br /> <br />Really? Who would have thought that forty years of American effort in the Cold War was just a waste of time? <br /> <br />This proposition is such obvious nonsense that it really does not need to be argued against, but the wonder is that someone who appears to understand the function of economics in history can fail to appreciate the central role of America, and specifically of the American taxpayer, in postwar Europe. America paid for Europe's reconstruction (Marshall Plan). America paid for Europe's welfare states (by relieving their governments of the need to pay for their own defense, and also in the form of endless credits and loans). America paid for Europe's economic prosperity (by bankrolling the agencies which funded it--such as the IMF & World Bank--and by opening American markets to European goods while allowing European markets to remain subsidized and protected; something that is still the case today, from agriculture to Airbus). And finally, itwas America who paid for the Soviet's defeat. Without America, modern Europe would not exist. <br /> <br />Yes, it is undeniable that Communism rotted from the inside. But rot by itself does not cause collapse (otherwise how to explain North Korea, a long-bankrupt thugocracy that survived even the death of the former thug-in-chief?) Such states continue to exist indefinitely, until given a push. And so to answer Judt's own question: the reason Communism collapsed when it did was because America pushed. Ronald Reagan reversed American policy and stood up to the Soviets, and did so at a time when the major Western European states were cowering in postures of supplication and appeasement (Thatcher's UK excepted). It had nothing to do with the Helsinki Accords. <br /> <br />Judt flatters himself in the preface that his book will be controversial, but to this reader his conclusions are too silly to be worthy of controversy. They are simply wrong. <br /> <br />It is a pity Judt fails here. The fundamental lesson to be drawn from the history of postwar Europe is that it is no good trying to make friends with the schoolyard bully--or to give him your lunch money in order not to get beaten up (the European response). The lesson is that you must stand up to bullies. Appeasement in all its guises--rapprochement, Ostpolitik, engagement, detente, Nixon/Kissinger-style scheming, or Carter's endless vacillation--inevitably leads to failure. And when the bill finally comes due, as it always does, then the accrued interest can be enormously costly in human life. This was true in Munich in 1938, and it remains true today.  <br /> <br />Given the current state of the world, we could have used a book which reminded us of this basic truth right now. <br /> <br />There are numerous errors and omissions, mostly minor (Iceland is missing from the cover maps), occasionally more significant (For example, there is no understanding that the repeated attacks by American hedge funds against theweak European currencies did much more than just blow England and Italy out of the ERM in 1992. They also forced a hugely embarrassing French devaluation in 1993--in the form of widened intervention bands--and imposed a hitherto unknown market rigor upon the respective governments, basically requiring them to depoliticize monetary policy and rein in fiscal policy--major changes in how these governments governed. The attacks also contributed to the ready adoption of the Euro, as a collective defense against George Soros.) But any book of this scope will contain errors and omissions; in fact the strength of POSTWAR is its vast collection of facts and figures and statistics (although weakened by the lack of source citations.) It is in the small-scale work of collecting data that Judt succeeds. It is in the big-scale work of interpreting those data that he fails. For example, toward the end of the book there is an account of the disaster in the Balkans following the break up of Yugoslavia. Judt correctly identifies the nadir of postwar Europe: the slaughter at Srebrenica, in which 7400 Muslims were murdered under the noses of Dutch soldiers serving under UN command. He then goes on to contrast the situation when NATO took over, at which point the slaughters promptly stopped, and ten years of peace ensued (enduring to this day). Surely this is something to which you would ask: Why? The answer is simple: the UN force, as is usual with UN forces, was too small, had a weak and compromised mandate, was composed of soldiers who were inadequately equipped and commanded, and who operated under unrealistic rules of engagement. But the NATO force tolerated no nonsense, they came in with the intention of standing up to the Serbs, and had the ROE to do it. The Serb `army' (if thugs who slaughter civilians can be dignified with such a term) promptly collapsed. <br /> <br />Same lesson: bullies must be stood up to. Perhaps it is the fact that the force was American-led which prevented Judt from seeing this. <br /> <br />(At the time of writing, the UN is once again dithering in the same old way on the same old issue--this time in Lebanon and Darfur--a perfect example of why we should learn from the past instead of repeating it, as seems all but inevitable right now. What a sorry institution the UN has become!) <br /> <br />Judt gives some good detail of postwar political theory on the continent--something usually missing from English-language accounts, other than the obvious observation that such theory was mainly Marxist. Sartre and Camus were predictable, Foucault less so (a substantial presence in France, but more or less unknown in America). Judt appears to come from the political left himself, but nevertheless he seems not to have understood the basis of Foucault (which can be summed up, Deep Throat-like, as \\"follow the power.\\") In Foucaultian terms, the discourse of dissent (which Judt claims collapsed Communism) was something entirely dictated by the power relations existing at the time. He would have said look not at the surface, look at the constellations (a favorite Foucaultian term) of power. Any objective survey of the constellations of power existing in Europe in 1989 would center on the United States (and might still do so today, despite a united Germany, an expanded EU, and the absence of the Soviet threat.) In explaining the collapse of Communism, historical roads as diverse as euro-Marxism, macro¬-economics, empirical rationalism or even Great Man theory all lead to the same place: America. But according to Judt, Washington had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br />By the final chapters, any pretense of objectivity has been lost. 9/11 was not a watershed horror for the free world, but a passing American event that by implication the US deserved for its Middle Eastern policy. (Of all European leaders since 1945, Judt reserves his strongest denunciation not for Stalin or Tito or Ceausescu, but for Tony Blair. Why? Blair supports American policy--\\"blindly,\\" of course.) In summing up what (Judt thinks) binds Europeans together, it is \\"...contrast with `the American' way of life.' (p. 748) <br /> <br />Lastly, not just the content but the style is likely to be tiresome to American readers. There is an overabundance of smug English circumlocutions and double-negatives: \\"It was not for nothing,\\" \\"not perhaps terribly,\\" and the like. Meaningless modifiers, such as \\"more than a little\\" and \\"decidedly,\\" are used ad nauseum, so that the text sometimes reads like a student essay in which the author has tried padding it out to make the required number or words. Judt could learn from the great English historians of the past, of whom there are plenty, from Gibbon to Churchill. There is in POSTWAR none of their directness of language, that firm relentless empiricism which at its best ascends into epic prose, noble in conception and majestic in scope. It is what makes reading them such a pleasure, whatever they have to say. Reading Judt is just a chore. <br /> <br />In the end this book, for all its size, is just a sour little pamphlet--an insult to the achievement that it purports to explain. It is the written equivalent of those old photographs of Soviet leaders gathered atop Lenin's Tomb on May Day, in which the images of the purged party members have been carefully airbrushed out--except that in POSTWAR, it is not just a party hack but the main player who is missing. POSTWAR is not even bad history, it is non-history, just anti-American propaganda dressed up as scholarship. <br /> <br />It should sell well in France. <br />

B000FL7CAK|5.0|You know, I got a confession to make: I hate these kind of shows. Not that they're bad, of course not. Well-written enthralling dramas with likable characters and it's that reason why I hate it: you get so wrapped up in it that I was watching it on DVD going \\"...okay, just ONE more episode\\" and sure enough I figure I'm only 2 discs away from finishing the season so why not just finish it off. Be warned: if shows like 24, Alias or Lost got you hooked, well this show is certainly gonna get you hooked deep. <br /> <br />I haven't watched Season 1 yet(stupid stores don't even carry it for rent, let alone sale anymore) but essentially it's like this: the killer of Lilly Kane has been found but that's not all. Apparently, Logan is the prime suspect in the murder of a latino gang member, a PCHer and it only gets worse. Missing a bus ride back home from a field trip, she actually discovers the bus careened off the road, killing eventually everyone on board. Suicidal driver? Lost control? Or did someone cause it to crash? <br /> <br />One thing I remember hearing about the first season was that the main storyline arc, the murder of Veronica's best friend Lilly Kane, gave the show an emotional resonance, a kind of drive. A bus accident, while it's more ambitious, has a detached feeling at times, almost like it's just a big long mystery to solve rather than a need to. However, the season is packed with other mysteries and little cases Veronica takes that helps the show along. One complaint was that when the suspect is outed and brought out into the open, you kinda felt like...\\"uh, him/her/them?\\"(I'm not spoiling who it is of course so might as well use all of those). While it's not a horrible whodunnit, and it does make sense, you almost feel like all that work was done by....um, the suspect(s). It's hard not to spoil this thing when you're writing it. <br /> <br />What ultimately keeps the show together, apart from its characters, are the actors and luckily we have Kristen Bell as the titular sleuth. Sassy, funny, and showing a surprising pathos, she injects the character with a lovable quirkiness that even falls apart and breaks down. Yes, we all love our Jack Bauer bad***es but now and then, we fall for those characters with humanity. Then of course there's Enrico Colantini who is arguably the coolest dad who's likable and non...\\"dad\\"-like while still being tough and protection without being that strict militant dad. And what would a top rated show be without guest stars and we got lots, from Kevin Smith to Joss Whedon to Alyson Hannigan to Charisma Carpenter providing a season long role(and getting the Buffy fans riled up) with the last 3. <br /> <br />Is there any complaints? Well one, the severe disappointment in the extras. Granted it is a season set show so you're not expecting something full-blown like a Lord of the Rings EE release but you get absolutely no commentaries, 2 sketchy featurettes and an admittedly funny gag reel and deleted scenes. Obviously wanting to be rushed before the third season starts, you get the feeling they just said hell with any substantial extras and just went for it. My Samurai Jack discs had more extras than this. <br /> <br />If you're into these kind of shows you are going to get hooked easily. The problem though is that replayability isn't as kind. Shows like Smallville, Simpsons or X-Files were great because you could watch them out of order and still be enthralled while Alias, 24 and this show deserve to be seen from start to finish. So keep in mind while it will enthrall the first time, it's hard to watch them again without that captivation that had you the first time.
0807126063|3.0|New Orleanian Ignatius J. Reilly is monstrously fat. The corners of his mouth sink  \\"into little folds filled with dasaproval and potato chip crumbs\\". The reader can almost smell his stale odor wafting off the page. He's lazy, unbearably prudish and arrogant, a thirty something agoraphobic who lives at home with his mother and writes hilariously bad prose in the service of a pretend book on medeival and modern civilizations.<br /><br />He is shrill and dishonest, both selfish and self-deluded. And his mother insists that this hypochondriacal, gluttonous blob find himself a job. Most of the rest of the book is the story of Ignatius' trying to fit himself-a roundish amorphous peg-into a series of square occupational holes.<br /><br />The book's ongoing joke is that no one whom he meets in his series of adventures is much more appealing than he is. There is the seventy-ish Miss Trixie desperately trying to retire, Miss Trixie's masochistically inept boss at the decaying Levy Pants Company, We have the hysterically overdrawn Dorian Greene, Queen of the French Quarter and the mercenary Miss Lee, pornographer and tavern keeper.<br />Ignatius' family is similarly creepy: Mom conspires to have him committed as insane and her coterie of friends conspire with her. Their world, and Ignatius' is in a constant state of decay which seems like a good stand-in for their personal and moral decay<br /><br />It's become orthodox to say that Confederacy of Dunces is a `comic masterpiece' and perhaps it is.

I suspect that later readings of this book will reveal a more fundamental tone of sad and desperate characters none of whom are in the least capable of love and who are therefore, not loveable themselves. This ain't a book you finish with a smile.<br /><br />The author, John Kennedy Toole committed suicide before the book was published and it's hard to read this novel without that as a subtext. Ignatius is a creature without a future, with nothing to look forward to and everything to be afraid of. There is a creepy sense that the author may have been depicting himself.<br /><br />If Tom Wolfe had decided to depict the pathetic rather than the ambitious or if Charles Dickens had more of an ear for souls destroyed by boredom, we might have a whole literature of Confederacies. As it is, we have Toole's and it remains worth a visit.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and the forthcoming novel bang-BANG from Kunati Books.

0452270073|4.0|Depicting the mental and physical atrocities that soldiers were forced to cope with during World War I, *Regeneration* by Pat Barker is an eye opener. Engrossing me completely, the novel depicted a side of World War I that I had never delved so deeply into. From my European History knowledge, I knew that it was the difficult emotional and physical reprecussions the soldiers had to deal with after the war that were pivotal reasons for igniting the anger that led to World War II. Seeing these traumas through the eyes of Dr. Rivers, I felt as thought I were right by his die, attempting to diagnose and perscribe a treatment to heel the trauamas each patient experienced.  <br /> <br />Several intriguing quotes in the novel caught my eye, but none so much as the brilliant rebuke Prior makes towards Rivers,\\"When all this is over, people who didn't go to France, or didn't do well in France- people of my generation I mean- aren't going to count for anything. This is the Club to end all Clubs.\\" Conveying one of the main themes of *Regeneration*, Prior highlights the fact that in battle soldiers feel a sense of love and brotherhood that cannot be replaced or surpassed by anything else, making them an exclusive \\"club\\". Especially since he has no empathy towards his own mother and father, it is fitting that Prior hold this type of comradeship in high esteem.  <br /> <br />Beginning with immense promise, *Regeneration* had me enraptured, until Dr. Rivers' vacation, where I felt the book slowed down from the climax that it had built.  Aside from these few chapters, the novel is brilliant and captivating, telling a story that I could see being produced on the big screen.
0679643362|5.0|When I came upon a new translation of Siddhartha by the revered Susan Bernofsky, I was drawn to revisit this book from thirty years ago. Like many teens of the early seventies, I was affected deeply by Siddhartha. It offered me a way to find and embrace spirituality--spirituality that was more aligned with the Beatles, the anti-war movement, and my own peer culture than was my childhood Episcopalian upbringing. This new volume didn't disappoint. Bernofsky, whose translations I've long admired, pays careful attention to Hesse's musical prose and lyricism. The simple messages and Siddhartha's adventures were even more delightful that I remembered. This is a much more beautifully rendered version than the one I read in my youth. Bernofsky's mastery of German coupled with her understanding of and faithfulness to Hesse's pure and rather innocent lessons make this a refreshing read, like dipping one's feet into a cool brook on an August day. I'm glad I revisited this old friend. Siddhartha has stood the test of time. Bravo to Bernofsky, as well.
0307277674|5.0|I have read many books and this is the only book that took my breath away as i was reading.. Its brilliantly written. The twists and turns of the story, aside from the historical background its written in is amazing. this book pulls you in from page one. its definitely a page turner. i highly recommend this book to anyone! AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000GRTQSE|3.0|This just isn't nearly as good as Time Out Of Mind.  These songs don't carry that much melody, and there's no cool production effects by Daniel Lanois, since he's MIA. Just Dylan going through the same old motions, much as he did during the 1980s.  This is not a 1-2-3 punch (following Time Out Of Mind, and \\"Love And Theft,\\" which was released on 9/11), it's just Dylan filling out his contract obligations.  FIVE years we've been waiting for this?  I expected much better.  Also, his voice sounds particularly raspy here.  I thought this album was kind of boring, since there is not one standout song here.  Better luck next time, Bob.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|\\"Modern Times\\" is a very pleasant, mellow, and enjoyable set of 10 songs. His songwriting and singing are spirited and accessible, and his back-up band sound very comfortable with the materials and arrangements. Critics and reviewers are argue until the cows come home whether this is one of his greatest albums or not, though certainly it will stand the test of time as well as previous efforts such as \\"New Morning\\" or \\"Planet Waves.\\" The pricing ($9.99) at the time of writing is great, and certainly adds a compelling reason to enjoy this new recording by one of the masters of modern music.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This CD blew me away. This is the CD Madonna has always wanted to make. Ok, so she \\"borrowed\\" a few things. Who hasn't? It's great from beginning to end. Quite a few of the tracks hold a special meaning for me. She hit a nerve with this one.

B000FA57RG|3.0|I could've done without all the political preaching in this film, but the concert footage is worth it. \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" is astounding. I can't wait for the entire concert from this tour to come out on its own.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Just got off my flight from an 'unwelcome-ERNESTO' and rainy ORLANDO and was able to take in the entire 3 hours+ of this RIDLEY SCOTT epic on the plane .. .. And, before I knew it, the end credits were rolling when the flight attendant forced me to shut off the DVD player for landing!!<br /><br />AGES BETTER than the movie theatre/HBO version that everyone has seen .. ..<br /><br />The story is far richer, complete and radically different than what is now on the air .. ..<br /><br />And, I thought GLADIATOR was my favorite movie, but this Director's Edition blows GLADIATOR away by light ages .. ..
B00008977N|5.0|I have seen both Peter Gabriel and Genesis a number of times, and they never cease to amaze me. This concert is up there as one of the best in terms of visuals and sound. The band sounds tight, Peter sounds great, and each song has been crafted into a theater piece. Love it.
B000002GB2|5.0|The last John Curulewski album with Styx as we all know he left before the tour due to family issues and was replaced by Tommy Shaw and Styx went on to greatness.    Anyway this was Styx's first album under the major label A&M and it truly shows. There is a completely different sound here than the wooden nickel albums and it is probably Styx's hardest rock album. You can honestly hear Styx taking a big step towards superstardom.    Here Is My Song By Song Review:    1. Light Up (15/10) A Styx classic and a great song to start the album out with the keyboard work by DeYoung is just devine.    2. Lorelei (25/10) Another Styx classic and in my opinion the best song on this album. It was the first Styx song that featured a synthesizer. John does a great job on the drums and Curulewski does his trademark background guitar work.    3. Mother Dear (8/10) A Hard Rocker a good song but not their best.    4. Lonely Child (7/10) A ballad but they've definetely had better probably the worst song on this album.    5. Midnight Ride (9/10) Another Hard Rocker sung by JY a good song overall.    6. Born For Adventure (10/10) Another Hard Rocker this one sung by DeYoung. A great song. What can expect from Styx.    7. Prelude 12 wriiten by JC instrumental and intro to SMB.    8. Suite Madame Blue (20/10) A spectacular song starts out slow speeds up with the drums then slows down again with a keyboard solo. Then picks up again with some more great guitar and drum work than the every member sings. And they finish it up with some drum pounding.    If you're a starting out Styx fan this is a good album to start out with. A truly greay album very well done by the greatest band of all-time.
1400032717|4.0|Haddon has created an utterly unique book that draws its reader in and doesn't let go. This novel provides a clear window in to the brain of an incredibly intelligent autistic teenager, via an intriguing and meandering story. The novel switches back and forth between the plot and main character Christopher's genius tangents, and while at times I got impatient with his tangents, and just wanted the story to progress, I always ended up finding his ramblings remarkable. At first it was difficult to wrap my mind around what Haddon was trying to accomplish with this book, but soon found myself fully engaged and in love with \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\".   As this it truly a book that many will love, I will be passing it on to my friend who is a special needs teacher, AND to my husband who is an engineer and will love the charming math topics!    Grade: B+
0312335164|1.0|In \\"Digital Fortress\\" Dan Brown abandons his usually formula for novel writing (conspiracy, cover-up, bait and switch antagonists), and tries to be Robert Ludlum (\\"Bourne Identity\\") or Tom Clancy (\\"Hunt for Red October\\").  The result is a way to kill time if the person you are house sitting for has no TV and poor taste in 'literature'.<br /><br />I was particularly turned off by the remarks Brown makes about Spain and Spanish people, as if they live in the dark ages and are a million years behind the United States.  I have been to the Spanish city of Seville, which Brown uses in his book, and I have to tell you the twisting alley ways which Brown describes are there, but Spain as a whole is nothing like Brown describes it.  If this is the way Brown views other countries, maybe he should give up writing novels and get a job writing speeches for Bush.
0975991477|5.0|I am still early in the reading and so don't wish to say too much - but this book opens up new possibilities of our adopting much more positive worldviews and \\"power for change\\" possibilities.  The medical research seems to confirm intuitive feelings some of have had for decades - we are not victims of our biology.  Our biology doesn't define us but only passes on and reflects tendencies of our own ancestry (and our own thoughts) - and any negative inheritance can in time (perhaps over lifetimes) can be reversed by proper usage of our inborn spiritual potential for wholeness or love.
B000E97HIA|5.0|In 2004, the talented royal badness we know as Prince, made a very fulfilling comeback with the Grammy-award winning, Musicology. With its danceable hooks and solid pop-soul arrangements, Musicology proved that Prince hadn't lost his golden touch and could still make a solid record over the course of his twenty-plus years in the record business. But two years have passed, and now his Royal Badness has returned with the long-anticipated, 3121. Two years is a long time to wait when fans are waiting for what a follow-up record to a largely publicized and successful comeback might sound like and Prince has thankfully delivered the right goods. 3121 offers something for everyone, making it a very addictive listen. The title track is a funk drenched jam, in which Prince reintroduces his atler-ego, Camille. \\"Lolita\\" is a synthesizer-driven, dance track that sounds very energetic and engaging at the same time. \\"Te Amo Corzon\\" is pretty different from anything you will hear on this album. It's one of those spanish-flavored tracks that sounds like a James Bond theme song, but really fits Prince's sound. \\"Black Sweat\\" is a straight return of the minimalist funk that Prince created or as I should say, \\"recreated\\" in his 1980's prime. It sounds like a simple Neptunes production, but Prince delivers something that sounds as refreshingly good as anything he has ever recorded or produced. \\"Incense & Candles\\" is another one of those sexy numbers that sports much quality and style. \\"Love\\" sounds so much like today's R&B music, but with Prince's unique power and talent, he mixes the sound with a quality pop flair. \\"Satisfied\\" sounds something of a sequel to Musicology's \\"On The Couch\\" because it has a blues influence to it, but also has that gospel sensibility that gives me chills. \\"The Word\\" is a spiritual number that somewhat links with Prince's beliefs and has some powerful messages. \\"Beautiful, Loved, & Blessed\\" has Prince doing a groovy, old-school influenced jam with his new protegee, Tamar. Tamar has an incredible voice and she really helps Prince spice up things with not only this song, but this album. \\"The Dance\\" is a slow grooving ballad that has Prince doing a chilling falsetto near the end. The last track, \\"Get On The Boat\\" is a funky, New Orleans styled track that is so celebratory and exciting. The band is so slick and funky on this song, and don't let me get started with those blaring horns. It's a very fitting closer. <br /> <br />In conclusion, 3121 is not only one of Prince's most consistent and tightest works, but it's also one of the year's best releases. It is certainly more accomplished and focused than 2004's Musicology. The production is very slick and probably one of the finest I've heard all year. There's no duds or weak spots here on this 46-minute release, so every track is a winner. The band is still satisfying and irresistibly funky. And not only that, Prince does a remarkable job with everything on this record. So, please don't hesitate to buy or listen to this one because this record is qualified to groove you from beginning to end!
B0002BO0HG|4.0|Antony was the only one I loved--okay Rufus was fine too-- in that horrible documentary on Leonard Cohen. So I went out and got this album. You really can play leave this CD in your machine and play it over and over and over.
0060555661|4.0|I enjoyed this book, for two reasons.  First, it gives us the accumulated wisdom of one of the best investors ever in our markets.  Second, the annotations by Zweig provide some updated historical context, so that we can see how the environment has changed.  Graham's central point is to invest in such a way as to maintain a margin of safety against killing losses, and he outlines some methods for doing that for both defensive and enterprising investors.  My main, but small, complaint is that the stories and case studies run on too long for my taste and tend to be somewhat dated, but the fundamental principles he describes are still sound.
B000G759LW|4.0|We saw \\"Stripped\\" flirting with the 80-minute capacity of an already-overextended CD format, and now Christina's songs have finally spilled over into a double-disc release. And, like \\"Stripped\\", while the album represents a great effort, there are a number of filler, B-side-quality songs. Somewhat reminiscent of an 800-page Harry Potter novel, you get the feeling that it's only so long in order to outdo its predecessor.    That certainly shouldn't steal the focus of the review, though, since \\"Back to Basics\\" has some amazing tracks, especially those toward the beginnings of both CD's, with a few notable songs further in, like \\"Still Dirrty\\". While the singer may flout her latest production as being a throwback to earlier times, it's important to remember that it is ultimately just gleeful pop but with some influences and themes from earlier decades. The album is well-produced, and those influences are worked into each track very well. At times it's oversung, but not nearly enough to get annoying; besides, it can be good to have a reminder every once in a while of how amazing Christina's voice actually is. :)    Fans of Ms. Aguilera have no doubt been waiting for a new album for quite some time, and this should satisfy them all. Hopefully this will not be the last; it's healthy and refreshing to hear (vaguely) feminist messages on the mainstream radio.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Slayer have kept a similar sound and similar lyrical approach over the years . . . and somehow they have never seemed so relevant.  \\"It's all just psychotic devotion/ manipulated with no discretion,\\" Araya bellows in \\"Flesh Storm.\\"  It seems that they are the only major act that has put out an Iraq protest besides Neil Young, though Neil doesn't exhort us to choose \\"666.\\"<br /><br />Any way, this is pure aggression for the new millennium with Dave Lombardo back and slaying at the drums (Thrash polyrhythms anyone?  Lombardo's got 'em!).  Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are consistently stunning at interweaving their leads with one another.  I mean, has there ever been a better guitar duo in metal?  Really, take the guys in Skynrd, make their (dis)harmonizing licks chromatic and dissonant, whammy them all to f**k and you've got freebird flying south of heaven for a real meltdown.  These guys only get better with age.  Envision a future with Slayer as old guys playing sold-out stadiums and warping your retirement.<br /><br />This is the real deal.  I got it a week-and-a-half ago and I listen to it at least once every day.  Riffs that stick in your brain like pork chops stick to your ribs.  Slaytanic invocations that lead you to live in the ultraviolence.  One big screaming bellowing FU to the powers-that-be.  Not one bad song.  A recipe for a great and mighty calamity that gives it to the man once and for all.
6305841861|4.0|Classic horror film sequel/remake.  Did not realize that this was basically a \\"do-over\\" of the first Evil Dead.  Extras were interesting and normally I pass over them.  Now I MUST see Army of Darkness to see how it all ends!
0452270073|4.0|This book resonated with me because the characters are very vivid and I connected with them.  Although the plot line seemed to drag at times, the book was still a very good reflection on the horrors of world war one.  I liked the fact that it was told by a soldier opposed to war rather than a soldier who was only fighting for the honor.  Sassoon is a fantastic character for the book and it is great that he was an actual person.  I highly recommend reading Regeneration.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|Way, way back here in San Antonio, Texas...on July 9, 1976. <br />There was a rock concert coming here with: <br />Starz, Mott The Hoople, Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow & Blue Oyster Cult- live in concert. Well, things didn't go as planned <br />because Mott The Hoople bus broke down coming from Dallas plus, Ritchie's private airplane ( cessna ) upon landing here at our airport, the front wheel colasped and the plane slide to a stop on the runway. Blackmore said that this was the second time he had trouble flying and he was pumped. Anyway, Rainbow did and extra set in place of Mott the Hoople. Ritchie has so much power with a finesse style of playing. I still remember him breaking up his guitar on stage and throwing it into the croud.  I've also seen him play with Deep Purple awell ( Feb 18, 1976 )- Nazareth open the show.   <br />Anyway, this live Munich 1977 DVD is just like the show that was here. Ritchie!!! You need to get with Glenn Hughes and start playing some rock -n- roll again!! <br />                                        Thanks, Kenny <br />                                        San Antonio, Texas
B000GIWS7E|5.0|This DVD is awesome to say the least. I would have liked to see 'Never Enough' or 'Panic Attack' on there, but that's just my preference. The sound and picture quality is superb, the songs are great, the musicians perform brilliantly. The orchestra adds a nice touch. For $14.99, this DVD is an absolute bargain.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|First, before I get into this set, let me say that the previous reviewer has a right to his opinion. That being said, THIS IS A REVIEW OF A PRODUCT, NOT A PERSONAL ATTACK FORUM! <br /> <br />Now, to the product itself! While I haven't purchased it yet, it looks like a great collection! There have been several so-called greatest hits collections for Michael Jackson over the years but this is probably THE BEST I've ever seen for this artist! It has stuff from even his days with The Jacksons! <br /> <br />Regardless of what you think of the man personally, this is a review of the art and music, not the man himself! I have my views on MJ but this isn't the place for it! <br /> <br />As a fan of music, I would highly recommend this piece even at its high price because it looks like it would be worth it!
B00005V9IK|4.0|I wonder if it says anything significant about me that I waited 10 years to see this particular blockbuster.  I mean, I always figured I'd get around to this film at some point, so I'm not a TOTAL cinema snob and distainer of all things commercial. Those clips of the White House getting zapped were pretty attention grabbing back when I first saw the previews back in the day.  Or just seeing those megalith space ships hovering over every major city in the world was pretty darn ominous.  So deep down, I always wanted to check it out.  But I guess I just was never in that much of a rush to.    Now critical analysis is sorta my game, and as the Amazon reviewer notes above, INDEPENDENCE DAY is mostly a pure fun movie--and not one many people are going to subject to intense critical scrutiny.  So why bother to review it all? At this point, it's available in so many different formats that probably all most consumers want to know is which is the right one for them and for their player. They already know whether they want to purchase it or not.  Reviewing the film as film may be virtually pointless when most consumers likely only are looking for a product review at this point.    Well, what can I say? I'm a critical analysis kind of guy, so I really can't tell you about the merits of the Digipak over the double or single disk anniversary versions.  To tell you the truth, I watched the thing on plain ol' VHS--that I picked up on sale, no less.  But I still liked it, even without all the DVD bells and whistles.  And, yes, the visuals were stunning even in this antiquated format.    But just an apercu or two.  Watching any film in which iconic American buildings get zapped from the sky is no longer the innocent escapism it was in 1995.  I even winced at seeing the twin towers standing tall (and unharmed) in some of the early, pre-catastrophe scenes.  We watch such things with more of a jaded eye these days.  Or is it more of a horrified stare?    Escapist fare is usually centered around a big \\"What If.\\"  These days, we pretty much KNOW \\"what if.\\"    Before seeing this movie, I had always wondered how well Bill Pullman (an actor I genuinely like) would pull off being presidential.  Was he a little TOO young? A little too callow? Cleverly enough, the screenwriters have made him a struggling, almost failing Commander In Chief, whose prior life as a hero pilot in the first Gulf War may have gotten him electec but left him ill prepared for hardball politics.  He's presidential in that youthful John F. Kennedy/Bill Clinton kind of way.  Unlike them, however, he's not much of political pro at all.  But also unlike Kennedy, he's still young and able enough to enter into actual battle once again himself--and  (many would opine)unlike Clinton, he has the guts to do so.      And that's something blockbuster films like to play on, isn't it--our almost innate, primitive desire to have our leaders be actual heroes?  Of course, we're just (post-)modern enough to want those heroes a little bit flawed, to say nothing of a bit conflicted.  Pullman is all that and more.  But there is never any doubt that he won't pull off his counter-offensive.  He's got that cute and newly motherless little tyke (the one who later showed up on CHICAGO HOPE) to take care of, so he cannot allow himself to fail.      And neither can the crazy crop-dusting pilot Randy Quaid, whose very family has pretty much written him off as a loco loser.  Somehow Quaid is able to inject some humanity and some wit into his stock loser-who's-gonna-show-'em role.  But still, there are times when you find yourself mouthing his lines along with him and wondering just how he pulled this off with a straight face.    Which you could also say about the rest of the cast as well.  These mostly very good, widely respected actors have their work cut out for them if they want to move their characters at all beyond the level of the stereotype.  Funny thing is, most of them do.  Mary McDonnell suffers anddies admirably.  Margaret Colin is stunning and sassy as a Presidential Aide.  Her performance is good enough that you have to wonder why she never became \\"Then Next Big Thing\\" after all, and I say this with utter conviction, even though I must admit that at the same time, I still keep mixing her up with Elizabeth Perkins.    And in the face of almost certain annihilation, she decides to put aside her feud with (still devoted) ex-hubby Jeff Goldblum.  Good thing too, since it is Goldblum's character who has figured out the alien invaders weak spot.  Now all he needs is the ear of the president...But how? But how?  Wait a minute, I know...!    Ok, so it's a bit cliched.  But in a tongue in cheek way, you understand.  The beauty of latter-day Sci-fi flicks is that their dazzling special effects are so overwhelming that you really don't want to be bothered with much else.  INDEPENDENCE DAY, like so many other S-F films, wants to come across as 50s flick with killer effects AND enough of a sly self-awareness so as not to appear hopelessly cornball.      And yeah, it's just cornball enough.  And yeah, danged if it doesn't all work somehow.
0345440900|4.0|As a first time Mom who had no experience with newborns, I was struggling with understanding what my baby wanted when he cried.  I was on bed rest for the last six weeks of my pregnancy and was unable to attend parenting classes.  After my son was born, I went searching for information on my own and ran into two schools of thought -- attachment parenting and strictly scheduled (cry-it-out) parenting.  I was not comfortable with either philosophy and found this book to be a great middle of the road.  It helps us teach our son that he is part of our family unit and there is no prolonged crying involved.  The EASY routine is a ROUTINE, not a SCHEDULE.  There's a big difference. <br /> <br />I purchased the book when my son was 7 weeks old and put him on the EASY routine. I am so glad I did!  I learned that my son was not hungry as often as I thought he was, but was suffering from horrible gas pains! Once I started to slow down, listen to his cries, and watch his body language I figured out that he was in pain.  We switched formulas and our son is a very happy little boy.   <br /> <br />I know that some people have issues with the information on breastfeeding, but I had already made the decision to bottle feed by the time I purchased the book.  It may or may not be the best routine for breastfeeding moms.  I also don't buy into the five \\"types\\" of babies, but I can see how it might be helpful for someone whose child fits one of the \\"molds.\\" <br /> <br />If you are a new (or experienced) Mom and you feel helpless when your little one cries, I recommend that you take a look at this book.
B000002KXV|5.0|I can see why Steely Dan was such a phenomena. Fagen's talent has such a wide spectrum of sound.  Each song on this album is better then the next.  Fagen definitely proved that he could do it on his own when this album was produced.  I listen to this cd 24/7, and after 13 years, it just gets better.  Sometimes this is the only cd that stays in my cd player for weeks.  The \\"Goodbye Look\\" became my favorite song. I'ld like to ask D. Fagen, what's in a Cuban Breeze? This album is most excellent.
B00005R1N3|1.0|This flick was so hyped I just had to see it. What a waste. It's stupid, totally ridiculous throughout. Plot has more holes than the Houston Texans defense. Predictable, not even scary. I mean they never check the attic? Cut the comedy please. We never find out a thing about the girls, this guy or really just about anything. The other reviews are just so bad. Honestly, what were you watching? This flick is a dog with fleas. Trust me take a pass on this dud. A total miss.
0618001905|4.0|Adam Hochschild, who co-founded Mother Jones, and taught journalism at the UC - Berkeley, has written quite a good book about the history of King Leopold's fiefdom in the Congo, an undertaking in which everything that could go wrong did go wrong.  In short, civilization as we know it completely broke down.    To start off, King Leopold II, who wasn't exactly a nice man, appropriated by hook and crook a huge colony in the middle of Africa, in areas unknown in Europe.  He invested a lot of money into getting it started, and then had to recoup his investment.  Because large parts of his colony were hell holes for Europeans not immune to the many diseases found in those areas, most of the men willing to work there were essentially lower class desperadoes willing to bet their very lives in an attempt to build up a nice nest egg.  When you combine a king who needed a lot of money quickly, desperate men eager to make as much money as they could and then get on with their lives, with helpless local tribes who were at times still cannibals, and certainly not read up on Rousseau and the like, all of this with no outside oversight, things are going to go horribly, horribly wrong, and indeed they did.      To \\"encourage\\" natives to turn in rubber, hostages were taken until the rubber quotas were met.  Unruly natives were frequently flogged and even summarily executed.  Epidemics broke out.  Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" which many prefer to view as an allegory, was, in fact, based on the horrors he saw.    A damning indictment of what humans can do, this book ultimately is a redemptive story.  Outraged witnesses of this heart of darkness, most notably Sir Roger Casement and E.D. Morel, devoted their lives to ending the misery in King Leopold's Free-State, and indeed he was forced to forfeit it.  The first organizations similar to Amnesty International grew out of these efforts.  These came too late for many natives of the Congo; these reformers couldn't undo the past, butthe point is that they were stopped, and King Leopold stripped of the Congo.    When Hochschild, who was long involved in the anti-Apartheid struggle, draws conclusions about colonialism in general, his book loses its balance.  I have known citizens of countries that were European colonies, who unabashedly told me that they much wished the British were still there, for two reasons: under the British, when they had a legal problem, they knew that the judge would dispense justice, based only on the facts of the case, and not on who knew who, or on who had paid how much, and because they, as members of religious and ethnic minorities, knew that politicians campaigning on racial or religious hatreds would not be tolerated.  Colonialism is, or was, a much more complicated subject than Hochschild insinuates, and the reader does well to bear this in mind.  Nor does Hochschild mention that some of the financial supporters of the \\"Stop Leopold!\\" movement were mainly in it so that they could trade with the Congo.    These caveats mentioned, this short but trenchant history of the Congo under Leopold II is worth reading.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|There really isn't much to say about this movie. It's basically 2 hours of a woman being attacked by strange monsters while she looks for her daughter. The story is extremely weak, and makes very little sense. The acting is cheesy. The only positive thing I can say about the movie is that it was nice to look at. Just gets old real fast. I really can't recommend this movie, although some may be dazzled to amusement.
B000E994KE|5.0|I had almost divorced myself from Amorphis.<br /><br />I was a fan of Tuonela (1999) and Am Universum (2001).  The progression to a more 70's-prog style from Elegy's (1996) psychadelic metal experience was appropriate and very enjoyable.  But 2003's \\"Far From the Sun\\" was - at best - mediocre.  It took all the innovations of the previous two albums and turned them into sonic (though sugarless) bubblegum.  What was worse, the Nuclear Blast limited edition was a painful 15-tracks long, few of which breathed life into the album.<br /><br />It wasn't Amorphis' \\"St. Anger\\", but they were on their way.  So it goes without saying that I was very close to ignoring 2006's \\"Eclipse\\", especially after finding out that Pasi Koskinen was no longer in the band.  But I heard the album many times while working for a metal promotion company (HeavyHitter Inc. in Chicago) and was proven wrong.<br /><br />The new album, a splendid and much-anticipated return to glory, has been aptly called a marriage between \\"Elegy\\" and \\"Tuonela/Am Universum\\".  Everything we grew to love about these Finnish metalheads is back - as if Metallica were to have realeased another \\"Master of Puppets\\".  Amorphis' trademark middle-eastern influenced melodies (originally found on songs like \\"The Castaway\\") are here in hard-hitting metal pieces such as \\"Two Moons\\" and \\"Perkele (The God of Fire)\\".  New frontman Tomi Joutsen provides a grittier voice on some songs (like the chorus in \\"House of Pain\\"), while providing an uncanny resemblance to his predecessor Koskinen (the chorus in \\"Perkele\\").  The growls have returned, adding their token malice to songs like \\"Perkele\\" and \\"Leaves Scar\\".  Even the folksy acoustic passages are polished, like the campy intro to \\"Brother Moon\\".<br /><br />All in all, a great package - \\"Eclipse\\" has breathed new life into Amorphis.  The album is a perfect fusion of old and new, bringing together the elements that made \\"Elegy\\" such a standout masterpiece with the new twists that come with a new frontman.<br /><br />We are far from \\"Far From the Sun\\", and even if we were close, it would be Eclipsed by this new effort.  Bravo.<br /><br />See also: Amorphis - Elegy, Amorphis - Tales From the Thousand Lakes, Nightrage - Sweet Vengeance, Vanitas - Das Leben ein Traumfrom \\"Far From the Sun\\", and even if we were close, it would be Eclipsed by this new effort.  Bravo.    See also: Amorphis - Elegy, Amorphis - Tales From the Thousand Lakes, Nightrage - Sweet Vengeance, Vanitas - Das Leben ein Traum
B00006WKSZ|4.0|Indeed legendary, this is one of those few live albums that are really necessary for a bands fans instead of just being a stopgap release or a cash in job. Produced by Dieter Dierks - what a career he's had - and originally released in 1978 this live disc shows the Scorpions in full flight to an adoring Japanese crowd.<br /><br />The only glaring omission here is perhaps Virgin Killer but that's a mild quibble. With tunes from a bunch of the bands early releases and a few cover versions to add a little fun and keep things fresh this album can be played the whole way through with little use of the skip button. It should be noted that on the original vinyl release the song Polar Nights was included but was left off here due to space restrictions. Scorpions freaks/completists can find this missing track on the re-issue of the studion album Taken By Force.<br /><br />Scorpions fans probably alread own this but if you wavering, then don't, just grab this album and enjoy a worthy summation of the highlights of early Scorpions, as after this the band changed tack somewhat to become a different animal. Recommended.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|The product arrived a little ahead of expected delivery date ,and is in brand new condition--couldn't ask for a better experience.
B000001EUP|3.0|Blackout is seen by many as the point where the Scorpions became what they'd be known as throughout the 80's. Basically pandering power ballad lightweights. The again with the kind of sales figures they were racking up it's unlikely the band cared, they'd paid their dues with albums like Virgin Killer and Taken By Force and documented their rise on Tokyo Tapes.<br /><br />Here we see the band roar out of the blocks with the title track, a metal tour de force with a line of humou running through it. Top stuff. But proceedings take a shift with the next three tracks, Can't Live Without You/No One Like You/You Give Me What I Need and this is sort of the blueprint for so much that went wrong with the band. Individually not bad songs, actually hits in some territories, but stacked up after one another it certainly drains the energy away.<br /><br />The rockers that come later do restore some order but aren't exactly awesome. But we do get an example of the famously bad Scorpions song title schtick with the albums closer When the Smoke is Going Down. But fans have loved them for such silliness for years and I can easily forgive them.<br /><br />Rock journos lauded this album as a link between the metal cred 1970's and the more generic hard rock juggernaut of the bands 80's and 90's output. That's as may be, but I can't help but feel a little let down by this album. Some great songs but for some reason it rarely hits my stereo, my vote going to Virgin Killer for that less commercial kill factor.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I completely agree with the sentiment expressed by the majority of reviewers: the is beautiful MUSIC! I have always been a huge Emmy Lou fan, and have always liked Mark Knopfler...but put them together,with lovely, easy harmonies, and rich and layered arrangements...and the whole really is greater than the sum of the parts. Wow. Give it a listen. A classic.
B000002IJO|3.0|Ratt here produced a hardrock album that is quite interchangeable with so many second tier bands of their time. LA Guns and Motley Crue are both prime examples of similar contenders. However where Crue produced Dr Feelgood to shift themselves to another place, neither LA Guns nor Ratt managed a similar trick.<br /><br />But it ain't all bad. Solid riffing and vox that aren't great but at least suit the music and the whole album riding a hard rock, down and dirty groove are three things that it has going for it. Lyrically this is party hard rock with no excuses for wanting to have a good time all the time. With more luck this band could of taken off - I mean this is a better album than Motley Crues Theatre of Pain and on a par with most of Girls Girls Girls. Rather amusingly the band actually had a song on the soundtrack to the weird Eddie Murphy movie The Golden Child - Body Talk.<br /><br />Beau Hills production fits the music here, not totally clean and teflon coated but actually suited to the bands Ratt 'n' roll sound and the overall feel is that the band by this stage were seasons professionals doing a job. Yet that is also part of the problem. The hard work didn't pay off and even by this stage Ratt were consigned to also-ran status unalbe to come up with the killer tune to breat the big time or generate the excitement the Crue did even when their music sucked.<br /><br />80's fans should pick up this and Reach for the Sky as they are the two best and most accessible tunes of the genuine Ratt years (ie ignoring reunions etc) and they ain't half bad slabs or party rawk rock.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|If you are thinking about passing on this release because of the setlist, you couldn't be more wrong.   <br />I've seen some reviews say that the quality of this concert is not as good as Budokan, but I would have to disagree.  The onstage look is that of a daytime soap opera, whereas Budokan is an evening sitcom, if I may put it into perspective.  Both are great quality, but have different looks about them. <br />As far as the sound goes, the music is great, as usual, but I would have to say that Labrie's vocals sound spectacular. <br />The standout tracks on here are obviously Six Degrees, and Octavarium.  Be forewarned though, both of these songs are technically divided into parts, both are tracks in their entirety on the DVD.   <br />The setlist, although shunned by some fans, is very cleverly put together in accordance with the 20th anniversary theme. <br />Octavarium is the underlying and most represented album, so songs from 8tavarium bookend the setlist with songs in career sequence in between.  Then there's the encore, Metropolis, which is also performed well.   <br />In some cases, and I almost hate to say this, the band is so musically great, that they actually overshadow the orchestra.  Sometimes you forget the orchestra is even there because DT just seems to outperform them. <br />As for the 2nd dvd, the documentary is great and very informative if you're a DT fanatic, and the bonus tracks are exactly that: a bonus. <br />So for hardcore DT fans, and even casual fans, this is a good DVD to pick up.  It is right up there with Budokan, and the only thing that Budokan has on this one is the setlist, which goes by the wayside once you get into the music.   <br />

0061124265|1.0|I read The Alchemist a few months ago and posted a glowing review of it on Amazon. I don't know what I was thinking. I must have been temporarily insane or something because looking back on it, I can't believe I fell for such a hollow load of rubbish. There were no real revelations to it at all. It's just a childish story with delusions of grandeur. <br /> <br />The idea that we are all looked after by the universe, if only we let ourselves go is a joke. Don't get me wrong, I know it sounds like a great idea, but let's face it, life's a lot more complicated than that. <br /> <br />Basically, The Alchemist and Veronika Decides to Die has about as much wisdom as you'd find in a fortune cookie. It's all just stuff to make you feel better about yourself even if your life is rubbish. What it comes down to is the idea that everything's fine as long as you're happy. So as far as my ex-girlfriend was concerned, she was happier spending time with some actor she met at her book group than she was with me, and that justifies her dumping me. I saw him as well. He was the usual type of scruffy look-at-me-I'm-so-dark-and-deep loser women always seem to want, even though they always say they want a nice guy in all those polls I read in their magazines. But hey, as long as she's living for the moment, and seizing life, then it's all fine and she can't possibly be wrong, can she? And she had the nerve to suggest in the letter she wrote to me that I should read Veronika Decides to Die and embrace my destiny. And she won't answer any of my calls because \\"now we need space to find ourselves\\", in other words, because she doesn't want to. She probably doesn't even know what she's done. And she definitely doesn't care. These books and this philosophy is so selfish and blinkered. Most people give up all this stuff when they leave university. Grow up and try living in the real world for once. This philosophy's only about looking after yourself at the expense of others. <br /> <br />I reallythink these books are dangerous. They fool people into thinking they're making the world a better place when really they're just acting like children. I feel really sorry for people who have bought into this. I just resent falling for it, and I'm angry at myself for having believed in it at the time. It makes me feel used, if you want the truth. I really feel like warning as many people so they don't make the same mistake that I did. <br /> <br />At least I can see it for what it is now. A complete waste of time. I just want my time back. I want it all back. Every last minute, every book I read, every film I saw, everything. But life's not like that. And it'll never be like this book either.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|A lot of people are looking for something to complain about in Dylans newest release MODERN TIMES. Blah! Blah to them, not Dylan. What do you expect from a man who is 65, and has narrowly escaped deaths passages more than a few times. I personally can't help but love every song, maybe because I always seem to be in awe of this guy, I don't know. I have no complaints at all. Not one. I bought the disc yesterday on my lunch break, and have just finished my third listen. I couldn't have asked for more. It's been five years since LOVE AND THEFT, and in that time the previous record has grown to become my absolute favorite Dylan overall. I don't really even know why that is. It's like the man who has written some of times greatest prose, is goofin' all over everything these days, and croakin' it out like a haggered old weasel. The scholars and novelists may not care to much for the new stuff, but it lights me up like a Christmas tree at the holidays. I can easily say the same for this newest addition to the Dylan cannon. Every time you think that Bob Dylan is dead, it turns out he was only taking a power nap. Mo'Fo's got at least 44 more albums to put out, and all you critics should realize that your either with him or your not. I personally have been on board whole heartidly since L&T, and MODERN TIMES just makes me want to keep the steam rolling! Rock On you crazy old [...]!
B000000XCD|5.0|When I first heard this album in 1969. it was on vinyl. A friend had just purchased it and had just unwrapped the plastic that was on it. He placed it on the turntable and within three notes of the first track (Green River) the place was rocking.  <br /> <br />This album was a keeper then and still is today.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|First off, I wasn't a fan of the tracklisting when I first saw it. Then I began to thing about it and realized that I didn't want the same songs on every DVD. If I want to see and hear my favorite songs I can always put on Budokan or Scenes From New York. I really loved the fact that they played \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" and \\"Octavarium\\" all the way through. Those two songs alone ate up 1/3 of the show. The band was as amazing and tight as always, no more discussion needed on that subject. The Orchestra really added to the second half of the show, but more importantly, they didn't drown out the band the fans paid to see.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality are as great as Budokan and the venue isn't as dark, which I prefer. The special features contain an informative (although rather short for my tastes) documentary on Dream Theater's history, and three live performances that lack the picture and sound quality of the first disc. I'm not complaining though, because they are nice to have.<br /><br />20 years and 8 albums down...<br />here's to hoping for many more to come.
B00009W0U4|1.0|To say this movie is disburbing is a major understatement.  I was so dizzy from the first 10 minutes, I got sick; but that was nothing for what was to come. I wish time was reversible to where I could go back and not see this one.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This film may have gone a long way to typecasting George Cukor as a \\"women's\\" director.  The description was patently unfair because George Cukor was simply a great director, period. Such films as Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib, A Double Life, Gaslight, and his uncredited work on Gone With the Wind clearly establish that he was one of Hollywood's great directors and not just a women's director.<br /><br />The Women, which has long been a camp classic and fodder for many spoofs is a star-studded hoot. This is due in large part to the wonderful performances of Rosalind Russell, Norma Shearer (it is a shame that this Queen of MGM is not remembered well), Joan Crawford, Marjorie Main, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and the hysterically delicious Mary Boland.  The scene where Rosalind Russell and Phyllis Povah go to spy on Joan Crawford in the department store is high point as well as Mary Boland as the Countess DeLave decribing how she hates the mountains. Frankly anything Mary Boland did was wonderful (check out Pride and Prejudice).  The performances of Joan Fontaine and Virginia Weidler (Little Mary Haines) seem dated now, however they fit wonderfully into the film.<br /><br />The Women is a rarity because it is one of the only Hollywood films made where the cast is entirely women and there is no man to be seen.  This is a must see for anyone who wants to see what Hollywood films once were.  It will also make you wonder how in the hell they are going to pull of that rumored remake with Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan.
B000001ELR|5.0|This is without question KISS's best album. Not because it's the the heaviest one, but because it's the most musically coherent album in KISS's catalog. The band's albums, both before and following 'Creatures' were plagued with annoying songwriting inconsistencies that kept me from being a full-fledged fan of the band. Owning 'Double Platinum' and 'Alive' were enough for me.<br /><br />For example, having a song like \\"Detroit Rock City\\" on an album with \\"Beth\\" never made sense to me. It doesn't show diversity in my opinion, nor does it show the work of good songwriters and an understanding producer. No, it just shows that KISS's record company was harassing them to make money with singles. In those conditions, songwriting and album production suffers.<br /><br />Not this time, buddy. One can tell that KISS was ANGRY...not just at eachother, but at their producers, their record company, and the world. And with 'Creatures of the Night', KISS for probably the first time in their career showed everyone they meant business. Of course, this would quickly disappear with 'Lick It Up' - gotta love Gene and Paul, right? (The anger wouldn't make a comeback until 'Revenge' in '92).<br /><br />Bottom Line: Did you ever wish that KISS would have just made an album full of Deuce's, Detroit Rock City's, Larger Than Life's, She's, and Heaven's On Fire's? Look no further.<br /><br />Also recommended: Revenge (1992)
B000G759LW|4.0|I listened to this cd a week before it came out.  I love the single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and perhaps 2/3 of the songs on the 2 discs.  There are many great songs on this cd and that's why I've decided to give it 4 stars.  Many are simply incredible like \\"Hurt,\\" \\"I've Got Trouble,\\" and \\"Slow Down Baby\\"--just a few highlights out of many great songs. <br /> <br />However, a song like \\"Thank You\\" is a perfect example of the disappointing side of this cd.  In the song, \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" is remixed, while Christina fans lather praise on her.  However, rather than a \\"thank you\\" this comes across more as a \\"yes, thank me\\" from Christina.  Some girl thanks Christina for saving her life.  The girl did not kill herself.  \\"F.U.S.S.,\\"which stands for F*** U Scott Storch(who worked on Stripped) is an irritating tirade and frankly I and (I'm sure) most listeners do not care about her woes over some past cd.  Grow up.  Although the other songs on this cd are certainly not as bad, 1/3 of the songs lack substance.  If instead of making this a \\"concept\\" album, Christina had instead perhaps simply removed the annoying intro track, \\"Enter the Circus,\\" \\"Thank You,\\" \\"F.U.S.S,\\" and a few of the last tracks on Disc 2, I would be giving this cd 5 stars.   <br /> <br />A good editing job would have been nice.  However, now I will have to skip through the crap tracks and have to switch cds when one disc with great songs would have been sufficient.  This cd did not require any filler.  Most of the songs on the cd are amazing.  I'm not exactly disappointed, but I wish for example someone in her entourage had told her look Christina, your audience does not appreciate you worshipping yourself as a goddess on \\"Thank You\\" and does not care about your petty problems like in \\"F.U.S.S.\\"  Christina comes off as a bimbo, unfortunately.  Fortunately, she has an amazing voice and I'm going to bet that her next cd (Spanish-influence) will sound much better.
0312965788|4.0|I love these type of memoirs. A person who is not boasting about their skill or having an attitude. Simply shares the love of his work and love of his county. All of James Herriot's books are wonderfull. I was introduced to the children's books a few years ago and just recently started reading his memoirs. Love it, some parts were a bit dry but the books still flowed well and drew you back. Love the depth of scenery and anicdotes about the area. Recommend any book of his.
B000301YY8|5.0|What a great singer!  Did he step out of the 60's.  So heartfelt and intense in his lyrics.  Beautiful songs, wonderful writing.  James Blunt has something really fresh.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This CD, while quieter than it's predecessor, is a true musical masterpiece.  Once again, LaMontagne lets his voice and lyrics tell the stories while the music serves as only a back drop...never over-powering or stealing the show.  Ray's lyrics again touch to the heart and leave you picking up new meanings and new words with each listen.  Each song is well crafted and the production is high quality.  Everything from acoustic instrumental to bluesy jazz...this offering has it all.  Great brass accompniment, piano and guitar match his voice perfectly.  Sit back and relax, kick your feet up and drift off as this CD, the more you listen to it, will take you where ever it is you're mood wants you to go.  Highly recommend...already want more!
0891349553|5.0|This book, by Katherine Dewey, is a terrific resource book for those wishing to make animals from polymer clay - either to enhance their other sculptures or as a stand alone product.  Numerous pictures and examples, with detailed instruction guide you step by step through the process.  Animals included are deer, in two poses, frog, wolf, seal, bear and more.  She also includes examples of bases, such as a leave for a sleeping mouse.   <br /> <br />The book is well organized and transitions beautifully from one point to another.  Graphics are included along with tips and tricks on making armatures and painting the final product.  This book has it all and I highly recommend it as a necessary part of your crafting library.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|I heard the track \\"put your records on\\" on the radio and loved it. I listened to the snippets on Amazon and decided to purchase the CD rather than just buy the track on iTunes.

I highly recommend this delicious album!
0385474547|5.0|&#34;Things Fall Apart&#34; is a book that is likely to be enjoyed right away by somebody with a curious mind out to become familiar with the way of life or culture of a people and of an era that is long gone. It is for a soul seeking to understand American cultures, traditions, cultures and history. Through the complex character of Okonkwo, Chinua Achebe provides us with insights of how the Igbos. Nigeria and the rest of Africa were pacified by the colonial powers that carved up Africa into colonies in the 1880s. Other works like &#34;The Usurper: and Other Stories&#34;, &#34;Houseboy&#34;, and &#34;Weep Not, Child&#34; take us even deeper into the metamorphosis of the continent. These are books one does not get bored reading over and over.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This is the bands second release in the new Millenium, and in their mid 20's, this band is still putting out pleasent and very technical metal that can honor the lable of Iron Maiden, unlike a lot of 80's and 90's band can claim.  I own all of the singles and the Vinyl Version of this album, so I admit, my review may be a little biased since I'm a huge fan.   <br /> <br />Again on this album, they are a six piece, with Janik Gears, Adriean Smith, and Dave Murray playing dueling guitars, Steve Harris on Bass, Nikko McBrain on Drums, and Bruce Dickinson back on vocals.  All but two songs on this album clock in under 5 minutes, and those are the lead off tracks/singles Rainmaker and Wildest Dreams. The rest of the songs are Epic type songs with slow and fast parts, winding tales and tempo changes.  The sound is very reminiscent of old maiden, and does get repetative during repeated listening, but still a very worthy album, not one to be trashed.  It is not just an attempt to milk the Maiden name for more money, but an honest attempt to continue their legacy.  One of the top 10 albums by this band, and one of the best metal albums of 2003.
0316174483|5.0|Love this little book! My 3 year old son has  made pictures with his fingerprints at his preschool. This is  a great way for children to express themselves by making their fingerprints into any number of little animal or other creatures. I bought this book for us to make projects with at home. I thought it would be great for his little thank you notes to relatives. My son loves this book. If you decide to buy this book, you will not be dissapointed. I also enjoyed using this myself as an adult.
B0000AOWLW|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theater, where the film benefited well from the wide screen and huge sound of a large theater. Naturally I had to have the movie when it came out on video; my children would never have forgiven me otherwise. The question was whether we should also get the DVD. Well, we now have the DVD and the answer in retrospect seems to be obvious: ABSOLUTELY!<br /><br />Our version of the VHS tape included an Elton John video as an extra, which was nice, but the extras in the DVD version are excellent and far more numerous. As Disney has re-released \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\\" \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" and now \\"The Lion King,\\" they seem to be getting better and better at value-added extras; more on the extras later. The principal value is in the movie itself, of course, which benefits from a phenomenal cleanup in both the video and the audio. As you compare the condition of the film in some of the extra features with the digital version you can readily see the improvement in video quality. The DVD sound benefits from the greater quantity of information available on the DVD versus tape, and the elimination of hiss and pop is noticeable. Movies such as these are the main reason that everyone should have a DVD player.<br /><br />The movie itself likely skirts the borderline of its G rating. There are several very intense and scary scenes, some involving blood. The murder of Simba's father is particularly intense, and may be frightening to very young members of the audience. However, I believe that with appropriate parental guidance the movie can be an excellent teaching tool as well as good entertainment.<br /><br />The story broke new ground for Disney, which has typically relied on western European and North American mythology and legend for the majority of their full-length animated features. This movie incorporates a central theme embodied by the Elton John and Tim Rice song \\"The Circle of Life,\\" which has significant ecological meaning as well as explaining life and death. A scary thought for the very young, but the movie introduces the concept that those who have lived before live on, and as long as you remember them, they can never truly be gone, a beautiful and wonderful thought, and but a fraction of the wonderful philosophy lived by the animals in the movie.<br /><br />The story itself is a story of maturing and realizing responsibilities, and telling the truth. Simba is the future king of the pride, and it will be his responsibility to lead the pride and to guard the pride lands, keeping the balance of all things. Simba's father Mufasa (James Earl Jones) is the wise king trying to teach Simba to always do the right thing. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) has always felt that he should be king, and uses Simba to put Mufasa in a position to be killed. Mufasa then tells Simba that it's all his fault. Simba runs away in guilt and shame.<br /><br />The next portion of the story shows Simba as he meets new friends and grows up, but has yet to take responsibility for anything. A female cub Simba knew before he ran away, Nala (Moira Kelly), comes seeking help for the pride, as the pride lands have become desolate. She finds Simba (as an adult voiced by Matthew Broderick). At first she is unable to convince Simba that he needs to do anything, but after talking to his father (an excellent scene), Simba realizes that it is his responsibility as Mufasa's son to help the pride.<br /><br />The next portion of the movie involves the confrontation between Scar, his henchmen, the hyenas, and the lionesses and Simba. The ending has another somewhat frightening moment for the younger members of the audience, but of course we know what the outcome must be.<br /><br />The extras deserve description, because several are among the best I've yet seen on a Disney DVD. Both Elton John's videos are included for \\"The Circle of Life\\" and \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\\" Elton's performance in both videos is nothing less than phenomenal. There is one place in the extras where Elton is shown with a full-grown lion. That image alone was worth viewing the voluminous extras. There is another section on the African influence to the movie, particularly the contribution of Lebo M.<br /><br />Another section of the extras talk about the animals themselves, and their actual behavior versus their behavior in the movie. We also see scenes of actual animals to compare to the animated animals.<br /><br />There are a couple of video games, one of which was interesting; the other would perhaps appeal to children. One was a personality test, to see which of the characters you are most like; enjoyable.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|The film effectively captures 1960's single seater racing when the circuits looked real and not like video arcade games. <br />I saw the movie in its original cinerama format and the DVD is a wonderful trip down memory lane. <br />The extras include a visit to Brands Hatch, but AI Grand Prix cars are used to show the correct line through the various corners. This would have been far more effective if period cars had been used. <br />Nevertheless still a good buy for the enthusiast.
B0007KIFGE|4.0|I was concerned that this movie would either be influenced by the continued backlash from Viet Nam or would be so incredibly over-the-top as to be completely unbelievable. I was pleased that the movie combined a bit of political intrigue with generally realistic military action to yield a very enjoyable movie. There are a few moments where the movie is unbelievable, but those moments are few enough to get you to the end.<br /><br />Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) and his friend and partner Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are flying a routine mission over Bosnia. They fly into territory into which they are not permitted. During their flight they see something on the ground that causes them to take a closer look. Using their new digital image recording system they take high-speed pictures of an area that incriminates Serbians in aggression towards Bosnians. The Serbians shoot down the F-18 with SAMs, later blaming the incident on rebel Bosnians.<br /><br />Once the plane is shot down the two vulnerable pilots are quickly found by Serbian forces. Stackhouse is quickly executed, causing Burnett to yell in anguish and anger, which of course was a serious mistake because Stackhouse's executioner hears Burnett, and the chase is on.<br /><br />This movie is all about the chase. Burnett runs for his life, trying to reach an extraction point. The Serbian executioner that murdered Stackhouse chases Burnett almost to the end of the film. During the chase there are several incidents that were very creative, though incredible in their coincidence. One example happens when Burnett has a large group of Serbians on his heels. The chase is being watched from Burnett's aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson. When Burnett trips and falls according to the infrared image, the anxious crew of the Carl Vinson are sure he is dead, yet the chasing Serbians miraculously do not find him. You'll have to watch the movie to see why.<br /><br />Burnett tries continually to make his way to the rendezvous point for extraction, and is continuously stymied. Eventually the Serbians convince NATO that Burnett has been killed by the rebels, and the Carl Vinson prepares to head for home. But, as we all know, Burnett is still trying to get out. I'll not spoil the ending, which is the one portion of the movie that is really over-the-top, reminiscent of James Bond.<br /><br />While the movie contains flaws in how the action is portrayed, for entertainment and patriotism it is a good bet, particularly if you enjoy military action movies.vous point for extraction, and is continuously stymied.

B000067FYG|4.0|I had heard so many negative things about this movie that it took me a long time to gain the courage to watch it. I am glad I did. While Freddie Prinze, Jr., and Sarah Michelle Gellar appear initially miscast as Fred Jones and Daphne Blake, by the end of the movie you can sort of see them as those characters. The real winners here are Matthew Lillard in his best role ever as Shaggy and a digital Scooby-Doo.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie finds the team of ghost hunters split up due principally due to the personalities of Daphne and Fred. Scooby and Shaggy are, as usual, interested in food, surfing, and food, remaining true to themselves. The owner of an island amusement park invites all of them, separately, to the island to help solve a mystery. After the not-quite-together team realizes there is a real mystery, the five some slowly grow together into the best team they have ever been.<br /><br />The plot of movie is relatively unimportant. We have seen plots similar to these in dozens of animated Scooby Doo cartoons. We loved them. You will recognize the essence of those plots in this movie.<br /><br />I was initially uncomfortable with how Daphne and Fred were played. I was expecting both characters to act more as they were in the cartoons. However, as the movie progressed I saw the method to the director's madness. While I am unable to say I was thrilled by what I saw as a significant deviation from the cartoon characters, I tried not to get hung up on it. I suppose I should have been uncomfortable with Scrappy Doo whizzing on Daphne, but I was never a big fan of Scrappy anyway.<br /><br />I have yet to mention much about Linda Cardellini as Velma. After Matthew Lillard's Shaggy, Linda's Velma was the next best portrayal of the Mystery, Inc., team. Just as Matthew Lillard was Shaggy, Linda Cardellini was Velma. Interestingly, Velma, always played as the brainy, somewhat geeky, type, is the same here, yet Linda Cardellini somehow brings a beauty to Velma that was never in the animated shorts.<br /><br />The real charm of this movie comes from Matthew Lillard. I have seen him in so many movies, including others with Freddie Prinze, Jr., and while his characters were often done well, he is outstanding as Shaggy. I think the true star of this film is Matthew Lillard, followed by the digital Scooby. Every time I watched Matthew, it was as though Shaggy had come to life. Matthew talked like Shaggy, walked like Shaggy, he even LOOKED like Shaggy. He was perfect. Matthew and his best friend Scooby were cartoons come to life.<br /><br />Without Shaggy, Scooby and Velma, this movie would have been a disaster, perhaps not even making two stars. The three of them save the day and create the real humor and chemistry of the live version of the Mystery, Inc., team.Velma that was never in the animated shorts. <br /> <br />The real charm of this movie comes from Matthew Lillard.

B0001XLXNE|5.0|In 1975 \\"Jaws\\" was a phenomenon. The one theater in Colorado Springs that was playing \\"Jaws\\" had lines for every showing for weeks and the movie was in the theater for months.<br /><br />The opening moments of this movie became the standard for hosts of low-budget gore-fests to follow, completely missing the style and drama of this movie. Our introductory characters are doing what all young adults do, partying and having fun, never imagining the menace lurking...just...below...the water. The music begins, with the characteristic sequence used by millions to enhance completely unrelated water-cooler conversations; menacing, sending chills up your spine, it's that SHARK MUSIC! Dozens of cheap horror movies have tried without success to copy the opening, yearning to set the stage for the supposed horror to come.<br /><br />In its own way, this movie combines the drama of \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" with far more action, and the thrill of a well-done monster movie. This movie, while involving a host of protagonists, is ultimately a battle between Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and a great white shark, which represents not only itself, but all Brody's personal demons.<br /><br />It is amazing that a mechanical shark could generate such terror. Watching how the movie was made, it's relatively easy to see that the shark was mechanical. Stephen Spielberg used clever camera work in combination with the intensity of each shark appearance to keep your focus on the story and being held in suspense, completely ignoring whatever flaws there may have been in his excellent mechanical monster. Furthermore, the shark inspires fear not by crude use of blood and entrails being swallowed or floating in the water, but by frothy water and its sudden, yet anticipated, appearances, with a bit of red-coloring to bring out your worst fears.<br /><br />What enhances the terror of the shark attacks is that they occur at a public beach where millions journey each year. Shark experts Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) provide all sorts of true information regarding sharks to give you the picture that they are mindless killing machines (though that is an extreme exaggeration). The audience knows what is coming and yet the innocents on the beach insist on throwing themselves into harm's way.<br /><br />The final sequence in the movie is excellent and provides an inexorable buildup to the climax, fast yet slow. This sequence also provides what is probably the goriest portion of the movie. In the end, as in many dramas, the battle is between Chief Brody and the antagonist, the shark. Can Chief Brody conquer his fears? How will he do it? The suspense is just killing me! Here comes the SHARK!!! LOOK OUT!!!<br /><br />This movie is still suspenseful and well worth watching more than 30 years after its release. One of the best monster movies ever, and just enough basis in reality to be considered a drama as well. Five stars for a movie you can watch over and over again.erts Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) provide all sorts of true information regarding sharks to give you the picture that they are mindless killing machines (though that is an extreme exaggeration).

B000929992|4.0|My daughter and my wife forced me to watch this movie. Truthfully, I actually did want to watch it because I thought it might be funny and it looked similar to \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" which I also enjoyed. I was pleased that the movie turned out to be watchable and fun.<br /><br />Daphne Reynolds is a young woman in New York who yearns to know her father. As she grows up, she becomes more and more distressed by the possibility that she will never have a chance to know her father. After watching a father-daughter dance at a wedding one day, she decides it is time to act.  Off she goes to find him.<br /><br />Daphne was the result of a romance between her free-spirited mother, Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston), and Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), who once was as free-spirited as Libby, but ultimately succumbed to the prim and proper expectations of the British upper class.  Libby was left behind. Unbeknownst to Henry, he left Libby with a gift: Daphne. In case you were wondering, Libby and Henry were legally married in Morocco, though various characters attempt to obscure the legality of that marriage.<br /><br />Daphne has entered the scene at a very critical point in Henry Dashwood's life. He has given up his hereditary position in the House of Lords to run for elected office. Most especially interested in his success are Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce), Glynnis Payne, his fiance, and Clarissa Payne. Naturally all three of these characters want what is best for them and not what is best for Henry. Dahne's free-wheeling ways do not sit well with any of these three characters and they impress upon Henry that to win the election he needs to bring Daphne back under control.<br /><br />Daphne falls to the pressure of being the daughter of British royalty and becomes the beautiful, dutiful daughter, and adopts a type-B personality demeanor. We all know that Daphne's irrepressible energy and type-A personality will have to win out; remaining the meek, dutiful daughter is not her path.<br /><br />As with a recent, similar movie, \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" this movie has a fair amount of predictability, cliche and stereotype. However, as with the earlier movie, this movie too is a winner. The real success in this case is from Amanda Bynes and her interaction with Colin Firth. Colin sees in Amanda the person he truly is, and he sees that he similarly stifled his true character to fit into an expected mold. Amanda has virtually no interest in Colin's position or wealth. She is who she is; her real goal has always been to gain a father, not money or status.<br /><br />We love Daphne because she is a bit eccentric, but she is all-American, and engagingly normal. We find by the end of the movie that being pretentious should not be a cover for whom or what we want to be. Sure, the plot is contrived, but who cares? It's way too much fun to worry about such trivialities. Enjoy!s not her path. <br /> <br />As with a recent, similar movie, \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" this movie has a fair amount of predictability, cliche and stereotype.

He has certainly found his mojo these last ten years.The highlight of the set is a truly beautuful track- Workinman Blues #2. which will make you melt with a fine vocal performance and a great lyric. This is album that will go over well in concert. No reservations with this album at all! <br /> <br />The DVD could have be packed a bit more footage - a tad short for the extra amount.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character.<br /><br />Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so \\"out there\\" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually.<br /><br />You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of \\"I'll Cover You\\", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie.<br /><br />Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse is no longer with us, because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material.lso, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of \\"I'll Cover You\\", all I can say is that you have no soul.

I bought on a recommendation by Amazon, and several reviews.  You must own this cd!  Great rock songs, great slower songs, Cheap Tequila is worth the price of this cd alone.  This is like finding that great, lost 70's rock album you missed.  If you have never heard this or if you listened to this in the 70's and not since, Buy This!  As another reviewer said, a Desert Island cd, it is that good.
B000046PVN|5.0|After over a year of trying to find a seller of this fine soundtrack, I finally found it! It is high time that the full score was released on CD.<br /><br />The original soundtrack release from 1978, while still an excellent collection, was sadly lacking in several of the best cues from the film. Most important of these was Track 12 (Disc 1) in which the helicopter crashes on the Daily Planet's roof and dangles precariously above the street. Williams builds on it, introducing Superman's theme into it as Clark Kent runs across the street, then rips open his shirt to reveal the 'S' - the symbol of the House of El - then enters the revolving door & exits as Superman. At the end of this is one of my favorite cues; the Superman theme is played as the Man of Steel appears above Metropolis, flying over the city on the hunt for criminals. 'Crime of the Century' (Track 6, Disc 2) was one of my favorite cues; this one portrayed the missile convoy as it made its way along the freeway, where Luthor staged the accident to get his cronies close enough to sabotage the missiles. There are too many new tracks to list here that should have been included the first time around, just a lack of space precluded this from happening.

0143037757|2.0|See what happens when the author's friends write the reviews? After all the glowing raves given \\"Postwar,\\" I spent fancy money on it, and in the end, I came to agree with the only negative review of it I saw, in The Economist. You are misled at first by the acuity of the opening chapter, in which Judt explains how much the current peace of Europe derives from the severe ethnic cleansing that took place there during and just after World War II--a fascinating point quite new to me. But after that, over 830 pages, Judt tries to explain everything and gets to the bottom of nothing. What did Margaret Thatcher really accomplish for England? I still don't know, though I learned a lot on my way to not knowing. This was the failing cited by The Economist reviewer, too. If you want a history of the war's aftermath in Europe (though only up to the mid-fifties) try \\"1945\\" by Gregor Dallas: distilled, acute, clear, concrete, fresh, and compelling. Maybe Dallas needs to hustle academic insiders as well as Judt does, for unlike Judt, Dallas actually delivers the goods and deserves the credit wasted on Judt.

1563890119|4.0|This is, for all intents and purposes, Neil Gaiman's first real piece of work.  Granted, he'd been a journalist, and he'd written a couple of other graphic novels, but nothing on this scale, nothing with this distribution, and nothing as significant. <br /> <br />And frankly, it shows. <br /> <br />There are some faults that Neil Gaiman suffers from that most of his fans are willing to forgive, and all are in evidence here.  He relies heavily on preexisting characters (though in this case, it's not only mythological characters, but also a couple of moderately obscure stock DC Comics characters), but provides little exposition as to who these people are.  His general style is somewhat detached and off-putting.  If you don't like Gaiman for whatever reason, this book won't make you like him any better. <br /> <br />All that said, this is still a decent story in its own right, and a necessary step toward getting the best out of the rest of the Sandman cycle (which gets better very quickly).  While the first story or two happen to be awkward and clunky, by the time the book gets to the last chapter Gaiman is firmly in control of his subject matter, though he's still feeling his way around.  In particular, the last story of the collection is a favorite for most, being the introduction of perhaps Gaiman's most popular (and one of his few original) characters--Death. <br /> <br />As an isolated story arc, the first seven stories are roughly on par with most average comic books.  Nothing to write home about, but interesting treatments all the same.  I'm personally not nearly as blown away by 24 Hours as the majority of the reading public (though it does have one of the greatest humor panels of the entire series), but it's still solid.  Most of the material that you encounter here will become critical in later story lines as well, so skipping it isn't the greatest option. <br /> <br />In short, you're probably not going to get the internal references to the hosts of the oldDC horror series (Eve, Cain, Abel, and Destiny all appeared in that aspect, and were salvaged from those stories), you may not recognize the primary DC villain, but you can probably still appreciate the story for what it is, and it sets you up for much better things to come.

Anyone who complains about the setlist, don't forget that DT are huge Yes fan's, and they know what it's like to get live album after live album with the same freaking eight songs on them year after year.  I think the variety is awesome.  Besides, 'Greatest Hits' concerts are boring.  The orchestra was a nice touch.  \\"Vacant\\" gave me chills... wow.  The final run of \\"epics\\" is unbelievable.  The band is in top form, and in a totally different element than \\"Budokan\\".  This is an amazing counterpiece to that awesome show (besides the 6DOIT songs, there are absolutely no crossover songs).

B000AP04FG|4.0|Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in this action-packed thriller about a rather unorthodox married couple who have very unique occupations. <br /> <br />Pitt and Jolie star as John and Jane Smith.  Both are attending marriage counseling to work out the problems in their marriage.  Jane works with computers, while John works as an architect with his friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn).  They have dinner each night at 7 pm, and neither has much to say.  They live in a nice neighborhood and have friendly neighbors.  But in reality, there is much more than meets the eye.   <br /> <br />Unbeknownst to each other, both are cooly lethal, highly-paid assassins working for rival organizations.  They are both assigned the same target, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody).  Both John and Jane show up at the intercept point, but in reality, Benjamin was being used as bait to draw out both John and Jane.  The organizations have found out that the two are married, and there are orders to kill both of them. <br /> <br />Jane soon discovers that John was the one who foiled her attempt to get Benjamin, now she has set her sights on taking out her husband.  What happens now is a battle among husband and wife to see who will survive. Will John manage to escape from his wife?  Will they both realize that they are being used as bait in a much larger inter-organizational battle?  Will John and Jane join forces to save each other? <br /> <br />I thought this was a very good movie.  The story is very well-conceived.  There are lots of action scenes, along with guns, knives, explosives, and narrow escapes.  There's even an elevator that crashes to the ground from the top of a building. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are perfect together, and the film will keep you on your toes throughout.  I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  This movie gives new meaning to \\"till death do us part\\".

B000GRTQSE|5.0|This is a great album - although probably not as fascinating as 'Time Out of Mind' (his dark, late-period masterpiece), or as varied as the brilliant and comical 'Love and Theft'.  <br /> <br />That being said, there is not a weak song on this record. (Immediate stand outs for potential masterpiece status include \\"Aint' Talkin\\", \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" and When the Deal Goes Down\\".) <br /> <br />Although the sound is more laid back then the previous two discs - and one could argue that the uptempo boogie numbers are kind of similar musically - the songwriting and musicianship are excellent. Bob sounds fully engaged, and presents some of his loveliest melodies and thoughtful lyrics. (Yes, his voice is shot, and his style is different than his 60s persona. So what. The music is still first rate.) <br /> <br />If you enjoy quality music regardless of genre, this album will not disappoint -- particularly if you've enjoyed Bob's records and live shows from the last decade. It's still early, but I suspect this will hold up as one of Bob's ten great masterworks in his career. Buy this disc, and see Dylan live, where his art and performing really shine. The guy is really amazing.
1932100660|5.0|An extraordinary book, with startling revelations about how our health and wellness are so intricately related to the food we eat, and how little the medical industry does in this country to actually cure people. If you only ever read one more book in your life - make it this one!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Our popular culture demands the use of superlatives, but the truth is that Brian Wilson's gorgeous \\"Pet Sounds\\" is by far the finest Beach Boys album ever produced. Heart-wrenching and intense, breath-taking and affecting  -  this masterwork quite honestly lives up to its own mythology. The precious harmonies and beautifully sculpted arrangements are unequaled. Brian's sweet melodies coupled with Tony Asher's lyrics have a simple yet timeless quality about them. <br /> <br />This record documents the zenith of Brian's career as composer and, as a result, many assertions have been put forth on its behalf: \\"Best Pop Album Ever\\" \\"Most Infuential Pop Record\\" \\"First Concept Album\\"  -  but this wonderful sonic experience needn't be all or any of these to inspire me to raise my glass. <br /> <br />After \\"Pet Sounds,\\" Brian composed many more tracks reflecting his genius for his next project - \\"SMiLE.\\" But succumbing to the pressures within the band and the growing tensions with Capitol Records put an end to this landmark period. Much of the \\"SMiLE\\" legend is therefore built upon the artistic success of \\"Pet Sounds.\\"
B000F0UUIM|5.0|Orson Welles said he learned from the Old Masters: John Ford, John Ford, John Ford. The Searchers is Ford at his best, a film of enormous beauty and narrative complexity. Moreover, anyone who thinks John Wayne was a cardboard cutout should see this film. He deserved an Oscar for his portrayal of the emotionally tormented Ethan Edwards.
B00065MDS6|5.0|After Gordon Haskell sang on \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" for King Crimson's \\"In the Wake of Poseidon,\\" Robert Fripp asked him to become an official member of the band for the recording of \\"Lizard.\\" Also asked to join the new line-up were saxophonist/flautist Mel Collins and drummer Andy McCulloch. This group was then augmented with some interesting supporting players, including another \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" alumnus - the noted jazz pianist Keith Tippett - together with Yes vocalist Jon Anderson, and the brass/woodwind players Robin Miller, Mark Charig, and Nick Evans (who also supported Soft Machine). <br /> <br />As a result, \\"Lizard\\" is arguably King Crimson's most jazz-inflected album, developing further the direction suggested by the track \\"Cat Food\\" on \\"In the Wake of Poseidon.\\" The powerful opening track, \\"Cirkus\\", is the most reknowned track on the album, begining with a hushed verse from Haskell before launching into the menacing theme played by Fripp on the mellotron. The track boasts some of Fripp's most impressive acoustic guitar playing, not to mention a soaring saxophone solo by Collins. With memorable lyrics by Sinfield rich in theatrical imagery, the track builds to a cacophonous climax. <br /> <br />The next two tracks, \\"Indoor Games\\" and \\"Happy Family\\", are simultaneously offbeat and humorously full of mischief - the former with lyrics evoking disparate forms of hedonism, and the latter with lyrics concerning the dissolution of the Beatles. Haskell's vocals are distorted on both \\"Indoor Games\\" and \\"Happy Family\\", the two tracks being separated by the sound of Haskell laughing in a strange, uncontrollable manner. <br /> <br />\\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" is a more tranquil piece, whose lyrics and instrumentation have a medieval feel, reminiscent of \\"Moonchild\\" on \\"In the Court of the Crimson King,\\" or \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" on \\"In the Wake of Poseidon.\\" Mel Collins' atmospheric flute playing provides much of the beauty on this track. <br /> <br />Concluding the album is the bombastic title track, \\"Lizard\\" (though divided into several sections, there is a narrative running through its entirety concerning a prince who takes part in an epic battle), the first fully-composed \\"side-long\\" piece to be recorded in rock history.
0783226063|1.0|So awful you have to laugh to keep from crying.  The dialogue is almost impossible to listen to, the acting is wooden and at times ridiculous, and the special effects are very, very dated.  It reminded me of the old \\"Lost in Space\\" TV program, and that isn't good.
B000F2C8Y4|5.0|This latest offering by Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris is wonderful! The fact that  these two even got together at all is amazing! Mark's voice  mixed with Emmylou's breathtaking harmonies is just grand! There is not a bad song on this disc. Beach Combing, I Dug Up a Diamond. and This is US are my favorites. But personally, every song captures something special. Like for example Red Staggerwing and Belle Star. If you want thought provoking music, that is beautifully sung and orchestrated, buy this album. You won't be disappointed.
B000FVQYYK|2.0|I was a huge fan of Muse.  That is up until this album came out.  To keep this short, I was bored to the point of turning it off.  It was repetitive and obviously lacked creativity.  If you liked any of the previous ones, don't buy this one. <br />
B000GFLAI0|5.0|For what it's worth, this new Dylan album is the greatest thing this side of the world and I pity the fool who claims Dylans best work is behind him. I would rank this in the top four greatest Dylan albums of all time, and no, Im not what you call a \\"fanboy\\". If you like Blood on the tracks, Desire, Blonde on Blonde, and even Freewheelin', your in for a treat!!!!! I wouldn't be suprised if this moves him towards superstar status (again) cause even the MTV crowd would have to try hard to not dig it....BUY it now!!!!!!!!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Don't get me wrong here. I'm very much a fan of Iron Maiden. It just seems to me that they arent writing songs the way they used to...its more of the same but not of the same quality. I still put Fear of the Dark, Hallowed be Thy Name, etc on on a weekly basis, I havent listened to this album in a few months right now and have no desire to. Paschendale is pretty cool, as is Montsegur, but that's about it for me. One of the main things that I think make a good album great or classic is that it makes you wanna listen to it over and over again through the years. Appetite for Destruction, Kill em All, Powerslave, Dark Side of the Moon...all albums that have been in regular circulation on my playlist for the past 4 years. Dance of Death will not be remembered, so hence I rate it as an average yet disappointing release from a band capable of much more.
B000FZETIO|4.0|I certainly understand everyone's frustration about the original ending not appearing.  I too have been waiting YEARS to see this, and thought that we were finally going to actually see the footage with this DVD.  Alas, we get 12 minutes of Molly Ringwald, Jon Cryer and Andrew McCarthy talking about the ending, why it didn't work, etc.  The only one who sticks up for the Duckman is Annie Potts!  Even Jon Cryer tells us all to move on!  <br /> <br />Who knows - maybe one day we'll see it.  But while I'm disapponted in not seeing that original ending, I'm very excited about this DVD.  The featurettes are great, and are very informative.  I haven't listened to the whole commentary yet, but it was a little dull (what I heard so far), BUT I'll take that over no commentary at all.  And while a trailer would have been nice, as someone else said, for $10, you really shouldn't complain TOO much about this.  If there is one thing we've learned with DVDs, there never seems to be a \\"definitive\\" version - there is always another version lurking around the corner.  So maybe one day we'll see the original ending, but for now, I'm enjoying this DVD.  <br /> <br />Plus, it's got MOLLY RINGWALD people!!  C'mon!  It's awesome!!
B00003Q43A|5.0|I know many films with stronger plots, better writing, more balance. However, for sheer spectacle and fun, it's hard to top this one. Many stars appear here, and several give top-notch performances. Judd Hirsch gives a great turn as Jeff Goldblum's dad, and Will Smith gives a star-making turn as the air corp pilot who heroically helps save the human race. Jeff Goldblum gives his usual intense performance as the lead scientist who happens upon the code the aliens are using and also helps save the human race. I know this sounds VERY hokey, but it's all part of the special charm of the film. All this is secondary to the special effects here. This film won the Academy Awards for best visual effects and best sound, and believe me, it richly deserved them. The destruction of New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. are as awe-inspiring now as when the film came out in 1996. So many Sci-Fi movies seem to disappoint in one way or another, most of them take themselves way too seriously to be enjoyed. Believe me, this film is a fun ride from start to finish. Never mind the glaring ridiculousness of some of the plot lines, the movie just scoots along happily, and you just need some suspension of disbelief to thoroughly enjoy this. The tranfer to DVD is flawless, the picture is razer-sharp, and the sound is staggering. Several bonus features are here, and all are your basic bonus stuff. Check out the original biplane ending feature, it's so great to see that something so outrageous as an old biplane taking out a huge alien ship was actually considered at all! Anyway, this film is nonstop fun, and should make a great addition your collection.
B000002H97|5.0|Heard \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" on NY's Q104.3 FM station and became an instant fan.  I LOVE this CD -- the rhythmic nuances, the vocal quality, the production, and the intelligent lyrics totally won me over.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I recommend this movie.  I've watched it lots of times.  And everytime I watch it, I notice something I didn't see before.  It's an awesome movie!!!
068987474X|5.0|This book will have you laughing while realizing just how ignorant us women can be. It gives you an outside view as to how dumb we all sound when we make poor excuses for the guy who really isn't worth our time. Greg hits the nail on the head! Its about time there was someone out there who isn't afraid to tell how it really is.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|I am not a blindly patriotic american. But this film crossed the line. To criticize the US is nothing new, and I welcome everyones viewpoint. But in the end, it made the terrorists look like heros. It made them look almost like angels! The suicide bombers who have been killing inocents for over half a century now with no remorse, and we are meant to be proud of them. Having a movie critical of the US is one thing. I am fine with that and agree with several of the points, but having a movie that actually promotes mass murder and terrorism, is just disgusting.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Excellent.  Was exactly what I expected, and as I'd hoped it would be.
0316172324|3.0|As some other reviewers mentioned before, this book doesn't really explain how to \\"train\\" your brain for intuition-based \\"thinking without thinking\\". In my opinion the reason for this is that the author is so entrench in his believe that intuition always tramps statistical analysis that he does not realize that the only way your brain can use intuition productively is by collecting enormous amount of statistical data. You will never develop right \\"hunches\\" by looking at the chess board for 5 seconds like grand masters do UNLESS you play as many games as an average grand master. And then you would have trained your brain for hunches in chess, but it will not help you to have intuition about authenticity of greek statues. I belive book's premise that somehow you can \\"train\\" your brain to be intuitive in general and not in a specific field is false. <br /> <br />Also the book fails to mention that while some types of problems lend themselves to hunch-based solutions (simple and static like chess or whether to cross a busy street) others do not (stock market or insurance).  <br /> <br />Much more comprehensive (AND consize) analysis of this subject can be found in Michael Mauboussin's \\"Mauboussin on strategy\\" letters that he publishes for free on the web on the regular basis.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Excellent quality Widescreen DVD.  Very good audio.  Very funny story that Ohara played to the T. The indians were shafted again- though at least one \\"pale face\\" (Wayne) was in thier corner to help deliver them some dignity (Thank You).  <br /> <br />I want to know how did those old gun belts stay waist high anyway?
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I am a lifelong Star Wars fan.  I saw the original movie at the local cinema when I was 6 years old, and the SW universe is still a huge part of my life.<br /><br />That said, one of the disadvantages -- maybe the biggest disadvantage -- of being a Star Wars fan is that we are, by and large, fiercely loyal.  Often, that loyalty is taken advantage of, and this is a prime example.<br /><br />Like most other fans, I was ecstatic that the original trilogy was finally being released on DVD, albeit with the special editions.  George Lucas had a grand opportunity to please ALL Star Wars fans by offering both the SE and original theatrical versions on DVD, and allowing the fans to decide which they would like to own.  Why he passed that chance, I will never know, but I don't pretend to know and understand the ins-and-outs of DVD distribution.<br /><br />If (no...WHEN) Lucas decides to remaster both the audio and the video for Eps IV-VI, and leave them as the original theatrical versions, I will consider purchasing them.  However, this is a disgraceful attempt to squeeze a few more dollars out of the fans who helped put Lucas in the position he is today.  This fan, no matter how loyal, will not be purchasing this edition of the films he loves.<br /><br />See you in 2-3 years, when the next and latest \\"limited edition/special release\\" hits the streets.
B0000009SG|4.0|It's totally agreed that you'll never know what to expect with Frank Zappa, be it with the Mothers of Invention or his solo stuff. Over-Nite Sensation was basically the third version of the Mothers, which by this time pretty much exists in name only. The only connection you have with the original Mothers of Invention from the 1960s, other than Zappa himself was Ian Underwood, and he didn't join the band until 1967. Ralph Humphries, Ruth Underwood, Ricky Lancelotti, Jean-Luc Ponty, Tom Fowler, and George Duke are some of the other members helping out. Tina Turner, uncredited, even provided some backing vocals, especially on \\"Zomby Woof\\". Jean-Luc Ponty is obviously a well-known figure in jazz and fusion circles, having played with the likes of Elton John, Zappa's earlier album Hot Rats (1969), as well as a string of album under his own name, including one called King Kong (named after a composition from Uncle Meat, of course) which was obviously a collection of Zappa songs done by Ponty. Tom Fowler was one a member of the San Francisco band It's a Beautiful Day, he wasn't on their 1969 debut that had the hit \\"White Bird\\", but their 1971 album Choice Quality Stuff/Anytime (their third album).    Over-Nite Sensation found Zappa and the Mothers doing more song-based material, which obviously helped album sales. Unfortunately this album did not endear to many older fans, because of this new song-based approach, not to mention Zappa started resorting to eigth-grade locker room humor for many of the lyrics. But what can't be denied is this is a solid collection of songs, many have since became staples of the Dr. Demento Show. Perhaps the one song most worth mentioning is \\"I'm the Slime\\" which features lyrics that are totally valid to this day: a harsh criticism of television and the mindless content of too many movies and television programs being aired (I, myself am not anti-television, although television could benefit greatly if they aired something with much more substance). The song ends with an extended guitar solo that wouldn't be out of place on Hot Rats. \\"Dirty Love\\" is basically a song about a lady and her poodle, and what goes on between them. \\"Fifty-Fifty\\" features the vocals of Ricky Lancelotti, who has a unique, raspy voice you won't mistake for any other member of the Mothers, Zappa included. And let's not forget the extended electric violin solo from Ponty himself, and some nice use of pipe organ. All the other cuts features vocals from Zappa himself. \\"Montana\\" is just plain silly about a guy moving to Montana to become a dental floss tycoon. \\"Dinah-Moe Humm\\" features some really explicit lyrics, but the music really gets funky, especially with George Duke giving some nice use of clavinet.    I can understand why this album gets criticized by some, but I think this is an excellent and solid collection of songs. Might not be as challenging as the 1960s version of the Mothers, but as long as the music is excellent, I have no problems. This is another excellent Zappa album to have.
B000ERU9S2|5.0|When your heart races, when you sweat, when a movie envelopes you in a sea of intensity where you feel you are in the thing...the director has done his/her job. <br /> <br />I first noted Frankenheimer's work in the movie \\"Grand Prix,\\" just released on DVD.  I had never seen the movie prior, but it has aged well and I heartly recommend it.  I mention this because A) it is how I found this one, (a Blockbuster reccommendation based on Grand Prix), and B) because Frankenheimer notes his experience in Grand Prix being so integral to this one (lots for the car guys...).   <br /> <br />This move starts slowly, but increasingly builds it's intensity all the way through to the end.  The extras provide an alternate ending, which is worth the view in my opinion, and settled some of my angst remaining upon completion.  Frankenheimer takes advantage of principles of information sufficency - he tells you enough to understand without (ever) revealing some of the fundamental mystery.  And he succeeds - the contents of the case will remain a mystery, as will the relationship between Deidre and Sam.  From that perspective, it's more like a book; you have to use your imagination to construct a satisfactory  synthesis, and in the end, that is more than enough.  -Alan
B000301YY8|5.0|I heard \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" a couple years ago but never really listened to it's full content and shoved it off as junk. Then I heard \\"You're Beautiful\\" several months ago and realized this was the same artist I shoved off as having no talent. So I decided to listen to some tracks and give the guy a chance. I ended up buying the entire thing and highly recommend it. He does have talent! Most musicians don't have a drop of talent. This guys writes all his songs and music and sings it himself. It's well composed and you should give it a chance!
B000002LQR|2.0|upon reading a hateful review of their new album, I decided to chime in on thier older stuff.  Apparently \\"real\\" RHCP fans like only their 80's funk and BSSM.  I however loathe that stuff and embrace what they have evolved into.  Stadium Arcadium is fast becoming my favorite album (though, I say that about every new album I like)  while I still can't figure out why BSSM remaines in my collection, I listen to it every now and then but can't make myself like it, aside from the singles.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|i saw the other final fantasy movie- spirits within and for some reason i didn't like that movie at all. i've heard of final fantasy games but i never played any of them. recently i saw the final fantasy VII movie and i thought that it was a brilliant movie. i never played any of the final fantasy VII games but i think that anybody who had never played the games before would be able to understand the movie...i did at least. i thought the cg thing was really cool. they went beyond what other company were afraid to do.  they didn't care if it was impossible for people to stay airborne for that long or if it was possible that a 5ft8 120 lb male could hold a 5ft sword or not. they wanted the movie to look cool and the more impossible things looked, the better it was. i'm sick of seeing movies that look so real and everything has to be so real..movies and games have no room for reality. i think more companies need to let their creative imagination take over. overall the movie was really great! i loved it!
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Ray is the MAN!!!!!!!  No current singer/songwriter gives me the feeling I get when I listen to this man.  His music truly changed my life and opened up a whole new world of emotion.  That being said, the change came about from his previous release Trouble.  So, needless to say, I was ecstatic to hear he had plans to release a follow-up.  Ray shot the moon with this one.  While Trouble had many many great songs (Shelter, Jolene, Forever My Friend, Trouble), this new album has just as many (if not more) great/good songs (favorites are Be Here Now, Empty, Lesson Learned, Till the Sun Turns Black & Within You).  I cannot wait to see these performed live as Ray's live show is one of the best experiences of my life.  If you haven't seen him, you just gotta!!!!!!!  If you are new to Ray, this CD would be a fine introduction.  If you are already a fan, you undoubtedly already have this CD.  Great CD, best of 2006 (so far), go get it today!!!!!!!!
B00005OM5L|5.0|If you are a EC fan or a Blues fan, you need to get this DVD. Slowhand's guitar playing is at its sublime and ferocious best. Badge, Hoochie Coochie Man, WHite Room and the acoustic Layla prove that Clapton is undoubtedly the best axe man alive...

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|The movie is good.  It is not as great as I was hoping it to be.  But after watching it a couple of times, I enjoyed it.  It is much better than the first Final Fantasy movie though. <br /> <br />I have been a Final Fantasy fan ever since I played the first one on NES.  This one brought back many nostalgic moments for me from the video game.  It is NOT required for you to have played the FF7 game to enjoy the movie.  However, some extras will be in there that you won't really understand or laugh at but I see it as the same way as adult humor in the Pixar kids movies.  It goes right past the kiddies, but they still enjoy the movie. <br /> <br />I'm glad that they added in the little summary of the actual video game.  I was amazed at how much I forgot or missed after playing that game a few times.  I was happy for the recap.  Although, I'm still worried that if you did not play the game, you may still not get it even after watching that recap.  They did their best to sum up it up in a Cliffs Notes version. <br /> <br />As for the movie, the story was pretty light.  I thought it was very similar to the Star Trek, Next Generation movies where they did not advance the characters that much except for the main ones (in FF7 - Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Sephiroth, in STTNG, Captain Piccard and Data).  All of the other characters in there were just for nostalgia.  I liked to see them all again in their graphical glory.  I thought I had a tear develop every now and then... ;-) <br /> <br />As for the action and wonderful, beautiful, CG that this movie had - absolutely awesome!  I would recommend spending the $15 just for that.  The movie truly is an art piece in the computer animation realm.  The leather, the hair, the facial expressions (although Cloud still didn't have that many... he might have smiled at the end...), the city architecture - bravo to Square-Enix for their attention to detail.  Sure, the action may be way too unbelievable, but it still was an absolute rush. <br /><br />In summary, I must say that this one was for the fans.  It still is light enough for others to enjoy, but it was meant for the legions of fans that this game has.  I must thank Square for bringing these characters and this story back (along with more games).  Sure, they may have done it for the money, but I'm glad that they took another chance after how the first movie did not do well.  I honestly think they did it for the fans, and being one of them, I'm glad they did! <br /> <br />And it was good to see Aerith and Zack again.  Thanks for the memories.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Bob Dylan may not be changing the world the way he did 40 years ago but he is still making great music. This is as good as any of his classic recordings.  <br /> <br />In his autobiography he has a chapter on reinventing his performances. This CD is the peak of a process that began with his Tom Petty and Grateful Dead performances almost 20 years ago.
B000002MZ6|4.0|Concept albums are something that is inextricably linked to that genre of rock music known as progressive. But it has been noted that although a major exponent of that form, Mike Oldfield very rarely composes concept albums. He himself has admitted that \\"Tubular Bells\\" is not a concept album, but just a continuous suite of music. I would argue that \\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\" is in fact his first out and out concept album. Based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name, Oldfield forgoes the direct narration that the other famous concept album based on a novel \\"War of the Worlds\\" utilised and instead chooses to tell the story almost entirely with music. The form and shape of Oldfield's album is a creation myth and what better way to start than with a track called \\"Let there be Light\\". Naturally for an album dealing with the forces of nature, creation, technology and science Oldfield produces an epic and epochal grandeur too an album that could in other less talented hands turned out flat and uninspired. It was only logical that Oldfield (a musician always wanting to forge into new frontiers and technologies) should embrace dance and ambient music. At the time of the albums release this was a market cornered by Enigma and at times, especially on the lead single \\"Hibernaculum\\" Oldfield comes perilously close to sounding a little too like them. But amid the programmed and heavily sequenced music, Oldfield's soaring and lamenting lead guitar shines, imperious and saying so much more than mere words can. This album was also one of the first to have CD Rom material contained within it, Oldfield proves some twenty-one years after his first album that innovation still comes naturally to him. This is a definite highlight for Oldfield in the 1990's and probably the best album he did for Warners.

0684833395|3.0|I realize that Catch-22 is one of those landmark novels that people feel passionate about and that any criticism of it on my part is going to be met with some modem of outrage by everyone who feels it is one of the ten best novels of the 20th Century -but as much as wanted to love this book (and I did want to love it), I have to say, the best I can give it is 3 stars.<br /><br />The novel is well written and is full of amusing moments, poking fun at the insanity of war, with its best ammunition saved for the absurdly convoluted and twisted logic of the military bureaucracy, but these bright moments were not enough for me to consider this a truly great novel.<br /><br />Catch-22 doesn't follow a conventional story line, jumping back and forth in time. While this didn't cause me distress or confusion (in fact I've found this technique appealing in many other novels - including pretty much everything Kurt Vonnegut has ever written) but in this case I found the story moved aimlessly, consisting of little more than a series of loosely bound (albeit, amusing) antidotes. Amusing anecdotes are not a bad thing, but for me, there was no sense that the chapters were building toward anything. The story didn't feel like it was moving forward. As a result, my interest waned (despite the fact that the individual chapters were often entertaining) and it took some measure of discipline for me not to put this book down and move on.<br /><br />My complaint about the lack of forward-moving plot is the primary reason for my middling review(a mere 3 stars for this highly acclaimed novel), but it isn't my only complaint. Another is the lack of likeable characters. While Catch-22 features no shortage of entertaining, self absorbed characters complete with a dizzying array of quirky personality traits, after spending 500 pages with these characters, I have to say, I didn't really care much if they lived, died, deserted, or were sent home to the safety of the good ol' USA. Admittedly many of the most memorable characters in modern fiction aren't likable, in fact some are pure evil, but in the case of Catch-22 I think the novel needed at least one character we could care about.<br /><br />Is this a great novel? In my opinion it isn't. But it's certainly a good novel. It's definitely worth a read, but it won't make my list of the top 100 novels of the 20th Centuryy many of the most memorable characters in modern fiction aren't likable, in fact some are pure evil, but in the case of Catch-22 I think the novel needed at least one character we could care about.  <br /> <br />Is this a great novel?

0446310786|4.0|Modern literature has a polarizing effect. For every person who declares Catcher in the Rye a classic, there is someone else who will tell you it is a waste of paper and that it's teenaged protagonist is a whiney little brat (okay they might use a harsher term - but I'm trying to keep this family-friendly). For every fan of Faulkner, there are a few (maybe a few hundred) who will say the Sound and the Fury is incompressible rubbish.<br /><br />And then there is \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".<br /><br />Readers fall into two camps: those that will tell you this is a great American novel and those who say that not only is this a great American novel - it is the best novel ever written. I fall into the first camp. This is a splendid novel, one of the best 100 of all time, but not the best novel ever written.<br /><br />Over 1,550 people have reviewed it so far on this website so there isn't much more I can add. It is a complex, richly rewarding novel. Without becoming overwrought and sentimental it addresses difficult issues of family, racism, and standing up for what you believe in.<br /><br />A novel everyone should read.
B00005JOYM|5.0|<br />Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER is a powerful and disturbing masterpiece that left me proud to be an American.  Working with a brilliant screenplay by Andrea Berloff, Stone is free of political agendas and cooking on four burners here.  We are about to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the tragic 9/11/01 terrorism events.  So Stone and Berloff could not be more timely with a movie about one aspect of those events. <br /> <br />There must be a hundred stories about 9/11 that could be told, including Paul Greengrass' gut-wrenching UNITED 93 earlier this year and a documentary by Frenchmen on one fire brigade inside the twin towers five years ago.  The writer and director here focus on two real-life Port Authority policemen, the rookie Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) and Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage).  They remain trapped under tons of rubble inside the ruins of the twin towers, while their sympathetic and complex wives Donna and Allison (Maria Bello and Maggie Gylenhaal) watch TV reports and await phone calls.  Stone and his editors cut back and forth, both dramatically and visually, between the darkness with the two trapped officers and the sunny brightness of the anxious wives.  All four main actors give magnificent performances.  And many extras are played by the real-life survivors of 9/11, who just play themselves. <br /> <br />Stone told NEWSWEEK, in an August 7th cover story,  that WORLD TRADE CENTER was more a film about heroism than about terrorism.  I  have not seen the critically-acclaimed UNITED 93 yet, but the two movies should make a good double bill, if Stone's movie were not (an engrossing) 130 minutes.  He does show the aftermath of the twin tower attack and debris all over downtown Manhattan, without ever showing any terrorists.  Rather, Stone and Berloff (with an original screenplay refreshingly free of both gratuitous profanity and smoking) want to tell the exhilarating true story of two Port Authority policemen and their families on that fateful day--exhilarating because they come home to their wives with hugs, albeit long hospital recoveries.  People fearing a bleak ending, like UNITED 93 surely has, should know that Stone ends with a \\"two years later\\" picnic epilogue.  But there is also an eloquent roll call of the fallen on that tragic day.  This is a story I was glad to see told, and told by a master filmmaker at his best. <br /> <br />The sets and visual effects, the falling debris and fires inside the towers where the two men are trapped, along with a lot of makeup blood, are awesome and deserve Oscars.  Clearly, a sizeable amount of WORLD TRADE CENTER was filmed on location.  But the set designers have built the twin tower ruins convincingly on a huge vacant lot in Marina Del Rey, south of Los Angeles.  It looks like the real thing to me as a film scholar who has been to NYC once long ago. <br /> <br />Oliver Stone is the perfect filmmaker to make a 9/11 movie.  Working with real main characters, he is restricted in telling their dramatic stories faithfully and honestly.  Critics of him from, say, the underrated masterpiece JFK (1991), because of political agendas and polemics getting in the way of the storytelling, should be pleased to know that he just wants to tell a great story in WORLD TRADE CENTER; one about ordinary men and women as heroes.  It should make most moviegoers proud to be Americans.  I do hope it does well at the box office and on home video--incidentally, it was sensibly shot \\"flat\\" and not in \\"scope\\", so it should translate to pan/scan cable nicely.  Maybe for DVD, Stone can also lighten the twin tower rubble scenes a little; they were underlit in my tiny suburban multiplex screening room.  Unless he wants that much darkness for the scenes with McLoughlin and Jimeno.  Maybe they and the very gifted Berloff could all be interviewed on DVD. <br /> <br />

B0000062GE|5.0|This CD is awesome, by far Stabbing Westward's best CD.  I'm very happy to have it back in my collection.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I'm compelled to write because if you were actually wanting to decide about \\"Stadium\\" then you probably couldn't tell from some of these reveiws. There is SOO MUCH MUSIC in this CD (i'll be stating that a lot) and then come to find there is an entire OTHER CD! It was pleasant to find this for the price of just one disc too. JUPITER has the single you probably heard that brought about the decision, and there is much to love about JUPITER but there is just as much, if not more, awaiting in MARS.<br /><br />  FIRST, the bad. There are times you might find the song dragging out a little and wanting to skip to the next track, but there is SOO Much music and this can be cured by just not trying to absorb the entire epic in one sitting.<br /><br />  NOW, the good. There is some GREAT ear candy in this 2-Disc set. There are so many highs that it could be a greatest hits collection.<br /><br />  The Peppers have had a hell of a run and show NO sign of slowing down, although maturity is defiantley present. These albums can go from rock out points of dizziness, to slow relaxing melodies, and back again so that \\"greatest hits\\" starts to form in the mind again.<br /><br /> Anthony's lyrics are in top form, From smooth, to funky, to adrenaline pumping, to a marriage proposal, an sisters making babies with B&D blowtorches. His words alone deserve the Album multiple listenes. Frusciante has comeback with so much force it's still spinnin heads with that dynamite packed riff on \\"readymade\\".<br /><br />  I could go on but in short, this is a truley valuable Album with a small price, the band is in top form, there are definite toe-tapping, head-banging, love making songs to be heard and is really a milestone for a band in a class of it's own. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. It's so much music, in the best way.

B00006F7S4|5.0|OK, for just a minute or two of your time, you'll see these seemingly pointless 5 stars, but they REALLY mean something. This album is not one to just dismiss. It is not for the casual \\"Loser\\" or \\"Where It's At\\" fan, but for those who can find something besides the singles and the surface of Beck's music. This is defiantly for someone who understands that music is an experience, and in this particular journey it has changed the artist, and can easily be felt by someone who's a Beck fan or not.       A 'sad' album it may be, but never depressing. There is something that can't just be described as 'sad' inside the album. There's a voice that is calling out and heeding warnings to an empty room. It sings, and wails, and drifts in and out while it reminisces over the stains and tracks of the past that it wants to leave. It is a glance into human emotions that has rarely been captured, it takes you to an atmosphere so clearly painted by the artist and it is easy to get lost in. Everything in the CD starts to flow together, and it is done so effortlessly that it starts to pull you farther and farther out into its own world until you are isolated with the voice in the surrounding sea.    \\"Sea Change\\" glows with a haunting beauty that drips off of every verse and chord. Lyrics have so much power and imagery behind them to the point where they could become entire stories by themselves. There are countless verses that stay with you long after the music is over including  'Round the Bend' in its dark entirety and \\"In a sea change nothing is safe.\\" gives me chills every time. Musically, every song is effective whether it be an entire orchestra that plays a building climax or an acoustic guitar that directs you to the end with some advice before you go. After listening to \\"Sea Change\\" I often feel relaxed and have to drift back into the world like I was in some compelling dream.    Essential Recording. Hands Down.

0140187650|2.0|In writing her book, \\"Thinking,\\" Arendt claims that it was Eichmann's absence of thought that underlay his evil deeds; and that her conclusion drew her to write the book (\\"Thinking\\").   <br /> <br />Her conclusion was wrong.  It was the absence of feeling: the lack of feeling experience; the lack of awareness of feeling; and the lack of expression of it -- in all combinations.       <br /> <br />Despite Arendt's courageous reporting in \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem,\\" she demonstrates her own absence of thought - in drawing faulty conclusions, a sin of which we are all guilty from time to time, and one that is far less grievous than Eichmann's and those like him.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Hardly any Trouble here meaning this album for the most part is in a differnt direction than his debut album. This album is more atmospherical, personal, and subtle than \\"Trouble\\" with Ray's voice at times barely reaching over a whisper. In all, this is one of the most beautiful albums I have heard since 2003, when Damien Rice released his debut \\"O\\". Unless I count Nick Drakes ablbum's who I recently discoverd nearly six months ago dateing back to the late 60's and early 70's in which Ray somewhat alikely resembles in his aspiring subtle songcraft wich seems to extract magic. The producer Ethan Johns who also plays multiple instruments thoughout and arranges all the strings, has to be one of the best in the business right now because his doings are flawless. Very much reconmended indeed.
B000F3AAUW|1.0|I turned on Conan one night to see a band starting a song. They were dressed in towels and bathrobes, as if to show they're quirky and fun, but they played with all the enthusiasm of a chain gang picking up trash on the side of the road. As someone who plays both bass and drums I found the rhythm section painfully stiff. The bass the line plodded along just behind the beat and the bass drum sounded like someone whacking a rug with a broom. Just awful. The lyrics sounded like a work in progress. Can't think of a phrase? Just repeat one over and over! \\"I remember...\\" \\"Who do you...\\" When Conan came out to thank them I was sure I heard the band name wrong.  <br /> <br />I'm mystified when I discover that this is the trendy new band. Music aside, they should be banned from the airwaves forever for having the stupidest band name of all time. But the music, once you get through the hype, just plain sucks.  <br /> <br />
1400032717|3.0|We found it very frustrating that the kid was smarter than us, but we identified with his lack of emotion and inability to bond with people.  However, we sympathize with the mother for hating the father for putting her letters to the son she abandoned in a size 11 shoe box when she was really a size 7 (see proof in Appendix).   <br /> <br />The strongest character, in our opinion, was the grocer.  <br /> <br />We enjoyed coloring the pictures in the book. <br /> <br />Signed, <br />The Ribbons and Rifles Book Club...tune in for next month's book review.
B000FGGE68|2.0|While based on a comic book, the opening lines explain all you will know.  This is a word unfamiliar to you.  A disease had been adapted to make better soldiers.  It should have made them faster and stronger.  But it also made them short-lived.  Then the disease got out into the population and a war began between the infected, who were disappeared, and normals.  Violet was one of the infected.  She died.  She was revived.  She is now an almost unstoppable killing machine. <br /> <br />Violet has been assigned to capture a new weapon that could wipe out all of the infected.  The weapon is not what it seems and Violet finds herself the protector of a young boy.  For the rest of the movie Violet kills huge numbers of people while trying to find out the truth about the boy. <br /> <br />I have not read the comics so I don't know how accurate the movie is.  But without reading the comics I found myself completely lost.  Almost nothing in the movie has any explanation.  As the movie says, this is a world unfamiliar to us.  Unfortunately by the end of the movie we are still unfamiliar with it.  All we really have is characters, factions and other unknowns moving about through lots of action.  The viewer is left with many questions like why is Violet so much better than the others?  During the movie Violet seems to have two personalities.  One is the warrior strong and true.  The other is meek and unsure.  Again, no explanation and the transitions are almost jarring.  If you are familiar with the comic you will probably get a lot more out of this than I did, otherwise there seems very little point to the movie.

0446613444|4.0|I am a Michael Connelly fan and found The Black Ice not as satisfying as his other works to some degree, but still way ahead of his competition.  There was the usual brilliant writing I'm accustomed to with Connelly, but the story dragged a little more than usual in some spots. My big wish for this novel was that it skipped the romance (two different women in one week?) Still, being a Connelly apologist, they only took a couple of pages.  All in all I did enjoy this mystery that took Bosch to Calexico (a California border town) and Mexacali south of the border. Recommend.

B000005JH5|5.0|Kate Bush attracts too many eccentics and over passionate fans. She is a true talent but some of material is too self indulgent. She is a \\"hit or miss\\" artist.<br /><br />This cd, her debut, is her best. She was being mentored by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, she was young and the work is far more organic than the annoying wall of sound apparent from other works.<br /><br />The album is great b/c of the intimacy of Kate's voice. It is haunting yet innocent,  strong in power but at the same time quite delicate. She's no rock star but rather a beautiful voice conveying feelings.<br /><br />\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is the best song. It is much better than the re-mix from her greatest hits cd. Other notable songs are \\"Them Heavy People\\" (she performed that on Saturday Night Live in the 1970's), \\"Moving\\" \\"Feel It\\" and \\"Saxophone Song\\".<br /><br />You see, when she made this, she was a nobody and the work was sincere. As her celebrity status grew, the songs became more weird, less accessible.<br /><br />I would love to hear Kate bush with just her voice and an accoustic guitar!
B0001FUHV6|5.0|The music is a delight to the ears and soulfully touching. Listening to this, it's hard to not have mental images floating around.  I love all the songs.  There are few cds I can listen to that I love all the songs but To the Edge of the Earth, Heart Asks Pleasure First, Here to There, and Promise are some of my favorites on this cds. I highly recommend this soundtrack and watching the movie.
B000002U82|5.0|I am not a Pink Floyd fan. I bought this b/c I felt obliged to have this classic work. I am in my 40s and have heard all the songs infinite times.<br /><br />However, when I put it in a cd player at work, and listened to it all the way through over and over again, I realized the majesty of this album.<br /><br />This is not a singles work, it is like a show, a project that needs to be listened to in its entirety from start to finish. When you start at the beinning and play through the end, you will be hit with the brilliance of this work.<br /><br />Like I said, I am not a Pink Floyd, would not turn this stuff up if I heard it on the radio, but playing the cd though and through, this is a masterpiece, well deserving of its reputation

B0009IOR6Q|4.0|John Waters who likes to be called the \\"Pope of Trash\\" has done a lot of films that are outrageous in style such as \\"Cecil B. Demented,\\" \\"Pecker,\\" & \\"Hairspray.\\" \\"Cry Baby\\" is a 1990 musical that is utterly silly and frothy, but works nevertheless. Johnny Depp, now a big box office draw and critical success with Oscar nominations for \\"Finding Neverland\\" & \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\\" can be proud of the rockabilly Elvis-type singer he plays named Wade \\"Cry Baby\\" Walker. Depp performs his \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" type number with great energy and rebellion. Having him run through sewage pipes in his underwear is enough to set many a teenage girl's hearts aflutter. The female lead is Allison played by Amy Locane who worked in other films like \\"Airhead,\\" \\"The Mummy\\" & \\"Bongwater.\\" She does a good Olivia Newton John-like \\"Grease\\" character of the square girl who has a crush on Depp's bad boy. Stephen E. Miller who was recently seen in \\"RV\\" with Robin Williams and previously in \\"The Accused\\" with Jody Foster does a good job as the square boyfriend Baldwin who loses his girl to Cry Baby.<br /><br />The supporting cast also frolics and froths with Ricki Lake as sister Pepper who is intensely pregnant. Iggy Pop plays the daddy Belevedere and takes a scrub bath in a tub sudsing up favorite parts of his anatomy with gusto. Traci Lords who was an adult film star plays Wanda to the hilt. The deleted scene where she sits in an oversized champagne glass while other hotties romp nearby is way over the top. Kim McGuire plays the character Hatchet Face with a permanent mug. Susan Tyrell who actually was nominated for an Oscar in 1972 for \\"Fat City\\" plays the biker matriarch Ramona. She recently appeared with Bob Dylan in the film \\"Masked & Anonymous.\\" Polly Bergen does a nice job as Mrs. Vernon Williams, Allison's grandmother, who emphasizes propriety but encourages her granddaughter to follow her heart. Patricia Hearst (the same I think) who also worked with Waters on \\"Pecker\\" & \\"Cecil B. Demented\\" does a nice job as the naive mother who uses the \\"F\\" word in the courtroom. \\"Cry Baby\\" is meant for pure entertainment; and that it does! Enjoy!Waters on \\"Pecker\\" & \\"Cecil B.

1582403589|5.0|Since there have been a huge amount of reviews already done, I won't regurgitate the same exact points made already.  Bottom line is that this is an excellent saga that goes well beyond the normal apocalyptic tale.  I don't get the sense that things will or need to end anytime soon for our group of people just trying to survive in a horrible situation.<br /><br />Zombies are tools to be used to get at the heart of the characters in those stories.  A zombie tale can just be scary and bloody, but often they can demostrate some real skill on the part of the author to give us a really indepth character study beyond a lot of other types of stories.  Throw people into a real blender of utter hopelessness and destruction and see what they turn into.<br /><br />I typically do not read graphic novels but this is outstanding work by all involved.  I continue to enjoy the series through the fourth installment and wait anxiously for part 5 to finally come out.
B000GTJT0M|5.0|Just loved the HD on my big screen.
B000000YIQ|5.0|It's Sonny Rollins trio. Can somebody play better in late 50's ? And perfect production too. Like band's playing in my living room. I love similar productions, it's the best in jazz. Only two songs are composed by Rollins, but no problem in his music is essantial his solo playing. No highlights, whole album is perfect with beautiful resourceful playing. Must for any true jazz fan.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|In his latest Rolling Stone interview, Bob Dylan was quoted as saying \\"This is the best band I've ever been in, I've ever had, man for man.\\"  Quite a compliment coming from someone who's been backed by not only the best session men of the sixties, but The Grateful Dead, The Heartbreakers, and of course The Band.   However, after listening to `Modern Times' and `Love and Theft' it really is hard to argue with him.  He not only has found a band that can lay down an interesting backdrop to his at times epic poem-like lyrics, but create such good music that it stands up against Dylan's brilliant lyrics as an almost equal competitor for your attention.   <br />Instantly the high level of musicianship is evident on \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\".  It opens with short punctuated drum fills that bring to mind Cream's \\"White Room\\"  but instead of Clapton's psychedelic phase, the guitar sound throughout is more in the style of someone like Chet Atkins playing twelve bar blues.  Dylan's first line is introduced with a brilliant cymbal wash that sounds like it could be the rock n' roll equivalent of  a gong being banged before Confucius speaks.  But that first line \\"Thunder on the mountain and a fire in the moon/the river's in the alley and the sun will be consumed\\" sounds more like John the Revelator.   <br />\\"Rollin' and Tumblin' is basically a really great cover of the Muddy Waters classic from 1950.  Dylan leaves the chorus as is, but writes completely new verses all his own (certainly the original didn't contain the line about how \\"some young, lazy slut has charmed away my brains\\").  The subject matter of the original does remain the same however, with Dylan rattling off lines that sound like they were pulled directly off any classic Delta blues tune (\\"warm weather's coming in/the bug's are on the vine/ain't nothing more depressing than trying to satisfy this woman of mine\\").  In fact, this really just exemplifies how Dylan has reinvented himself once again as a bluesman over the last three albums.  The entire subject matter of his last three albums has been the subject matter of the Delta blues: religion and women.   <br />Every one of the hard blues songs on `Modern Times' contains the best soloing on a Bob Dylan studio album since \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" - and by soloing I don't mean just one solo stuck in between the words somewhere, but splattered throughout the songs naturally, never once sounding forced.  On \\"Someday Baby\\" is where it peaks.  The fuzzy guitar tone just glows, making you want to kill for whatever vintage tube amp the guitarist had to have been be using, and the rhythm just cooks.  This is one of the rare Dylan tunes where the music just slightly edges out the words in terms of pure listening pleasure.  Even Dylan`s singing is way above par here, especially listen to the line \\"So many good things in life/that I've overlooked/I don`t know what to do/baby you got me soooo hooked\\" and try and say that Dylan's voice isn't just improving with age.   <br />\\"The Levee`s Gonna Break\\" is another cover of a classic blues song, this time Memphis Minnie's classic \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\"  The verses are completely Dylan's own, but again the chorus is the same as the original made so famous by Led Zeppelin.  Of course before even listening to the song people are going to try and say it has to do with Katrina, but the lyrics have more to do with love and the apocalypse than anything as simple as a natural disaster.  Take for instance the line \\"Put on your camp clothes mama/put on your evening dress/few more years of hard work then there'll be a thousand years of happiness.\\"  Even an atheist like myself knows what he's talking about.  And then there's the final line \\"some people still sin and some are wide awake.\\"   <br />The subtle apocalyptic messages of \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" perfectly set up for the eight minute plus epic closer, \\"Ain't Talkin.\\"  The feel is the same as `Time Out of Mind's \\"Highlands\\", but Dylan's lyrical flow never gets disrupted for a six minute retelling of a conversation with a waitress.  The imagery in the song is dark, dangerous, and not very hopeful.  Picture Dylan walking down a lonely path through the Mystic Garden, in the cities of the plague.  His sick mule and blind horse are walking by his side.  At one point he is hit from behind by an unknown stranger.  Bad idea - the Dylan here is no one to mess with, he waits for his opponents to be caught sleeping and then slaughter's them where they lie.  Dylan also manages to fit in some of his usual subtle sarcastic wit, this time directed at his disillusion with the trappings of fame - \\"well the whole world is filled with speculation/the whole wide world which people say is round/they will tear your mind away from contemplation/they will jump on your misfortune when you're down...someday you'll be glad to have me around.\\"  Later he returns to religion, reaffirming his status as a diehard Christian, but still distancing himself from any organized view of  it - \\"ain't no altars on this lonesome road\\"  Really I could go on and on about this song, which is the crown jewel of the set, with every new verse being a revelation.  Musically the song is even more menacing than \\"Highlands\\" with the addition of a perfectly minimalist use of lurking viola, even though it ends with a happy crescendo, it only adds to the feel of apocalypse like it was a musical representation of Jesus returning.  <br />`Modern Times' is Dylan's third straight masterpiece in a row and only cements the fact that his current period can only be compared to his inspired 1964-66 run.  Certainly you could argue that with 4-5 years between albums it's nowhere near as prolific, but when the albums are this shockingly and consistently brilliant song after song who cares?  To quote the review in Rolling Stone, \\"there is no precedent for the territory Dylan is now opening with albums that stand alongside the accomplishments of his wild youth.\\"  The onlyperson to even come close is (as always) Neil Young.  Dylan himself, in the same interview, when asked about this being the third part of a trilogy beginning with 'Time Out of Mind' gives the best description of how great `Modern Times' really is:  \\"'Time Out of Mind' was me getting back in and fighting my way out of the corner [referring to his second infamous \\"dry period\\" after 1989's `Oh, Mercy' where he didn't release any original material]...on this record, I ain't nowhere, you can't find me anywhere, because I'm WAY gone from the corner

B000GRTQSE|5.0|I made the mistake of listening to this first on my computer on the XM debut the day before the official release and was a little disappointed.  That soon changed after listening in my car.  The CD has beautiful sound.  The band is perfect and Dylan's voice is as good as it's been in a long time.  There are a couple of filler songs but I tell myself that it's not right to expect every Dylan song to be a masterpiece.  Hasn't he done enough?  There are some songs here that rank up at the top...When the Deal Goes Down, Thunder on the Mountain, Ain't Talkin' to name a few.  These are songs from a man who has done and seen it all and rather than become bitter and disenchanted, he is content.  He's not trying to prove anything or live up to his past.  He's just doing what he wants to do.  I thank God everyday for giving us Bob Dylan.  And I'm grateful every time Bob gives us another record because it gets us a little closer to understanding and knowing this amazing man.  Get this CD.  Buy his whole catalog and study him.  Your life will be better for it.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Anyone who's played Final Fantasy 7 (a PSX rpg) should watch this movie.  It's the ultimate fan service, letting us once again share in the adventures of, quite possibly, the greatest cast of FF characters in the history of the series.  Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Barret, Red X, Cath Sith, Vincent, Yuffie, Cid. <br /> <br />The movie itself showcases the talents of SquareEnix CG artists, and shows you why they are still the CG kings (IMO).  The characters are beautifully rendered with vivid detail - this is the ultimate eye candy. <br /> <br />Many will not understand the story (especially if you never played the game), but you can still enjoy some of the best fight scenes ever (the Tifa fight scene in particular).   <br /> <br />Maybe someday, SquareEnix will remake FF7 with graphics like these....one can always dream, can't they? <br />
B00003CXBH|5.0|This film is as close as it gets to perfection in the genre of historical fiction. DeNiro and Irons turn in two of the best peformances of their careers. The story, by Robert Bolt, is both complex and compelling. Few films engage the viewer on such a deep level and ask them to make a choice between the characters and their convictions. Is it right to take up arms to defend the innocent or is pacificism the only path for followers of Christ? Best film to ever take on this question. The scenery is majestic and the film's score is haunting. This is a sad, beautiful film that will rarely be equaled.

B000050XEI|5.0|I hesistated to buy this album since I have so much of her music all ready; however, I was not disappointed in the least. I expected some repetitious sound, and there are examples of her signature sounds but that doesn't bother me. She has a way of making something similar sound new and different. It's so relaxing and that's what I need after a busy day. I don't know how anyone could rate this lovely album poorly. I have almost every CD Enya has ever done and this is one of my favorites.I like it better than 'Amarantine.' I love quiet calm music with a hint of celtic. Enya is definitely my favorite musician/singer of all time. I used to love Yanni but he has become too commercial for me. I can even tolerate Enya made to elevator music. She is who she is and I love her music.

Despite how horrific that day was for those invovlved and the entire nation, the movie not only reminds you of the devestation and the emotional toll; but it highlights some of the good that came out of that horrible day.<br /><br />I am glad that they were able to make and release this movie. It serves as a reminder for those especially so far away not to forget. Not to forget that America is forever changed as a result. Overall I found the story to be awesome and well done and presented for such a sensitive and tough subject matter.
0618477942|5.0|I've read quite a few books which combine illustrations and text and are called various things from \\"comic books for adults\\" to \\"comic book novels\\"<br /><br />  Whatever you call them, book which combine illustrations and text are not necessarily more accessable or engaging than \\"traditional\\" (text-based) novels or short stories. In fact, I'd argue that it is harder to combine images and dialogue effectively, to create a work that is truly riveting. When it fails, the images may be more memorable than the words - or vice versa.<br /><br />  But in THIS case, Allison Bechdel balances both the graphics and the text, creating a memorable, wonderful portrayal of a quirky, eccentric and downright odd family. I couldn't put it down. I loved it! Take a look at a sample excerpt, as Amazon allows you to do, and I think you'll be intrigued...as I was...and feel compelled to order the book. If you do, I hope you like it as much as I did.
B000A59PMO|5.0|The first thing that'll draw your attention to this show is its lead actress, Kristen Bell.  Boy, does she have some charisma...the way she portrays this spunky sleuth is gold.  Her force of personality alone would be enough to keep me watching.   <br /> <br />Luckily, the show itself contains some of the best writing on television, coupled with complex mysteries, plot twists, and an arcing storyline, making it a must-see show in my book. <br /> <br />As the season progresses, you'll get pulled deeper and deeper into the show, and pretty soon, you'll realize that you've watched an entire season in a day.  This show is too good to pass up, so buy it, enjoy it, and thank me later. <br /> <br />
076790592X|4.0|The book is an effective way to remind ourselves of what is important in lives. It might be depressing at times when it tells us in its own unique way (through short lessons) of how we have lost ourselves in pursuing things that really dont matter in the end.<br /><br />Take some time off and read this book. It will bring back to remembrance the things we have taken for granted and havent been nurturing due to the hectic pace in our lives.
B000AP2ZLC|2.0|I have yet to see why people rave about this band.  Sure, the drummer is really good, but that doesnt make Cryptopsy as a whole a good band.<br /><br />You want something different, go listen to Obscura by Gorguts.  It'll blow your mind and it sure blows away anything that crapsloppy has done.
6301557824|3.0|Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I thought this movie was decent. Not a real gripping story, I like putting this one on before taking a nap. The scenery and soundtrack are relaxing. If you are new to Clint Eastwood movies, I would go with pale rider or magnum force before buying this one.
0061015725|5.0|A fast moving and exciting story about the dangers of technology. I really couldn't read it fast enough. The characters were 'real' and the plot had just the right amount of technology (not being a technical kind of girl)<br /><br />However...if you are a technophobe then stay well clear...the plot will terrify you!! :-o
0684824906|5.0|As I was reading book, I traveled back to the times of Lincoln, understood what it meant to be a leader at that time, and how fractured the America as a country was. Attention to the minute details of the time showed how intensive the research was. This book not only showed the times of Lincoln, who he was but also brought some sense of bewilderment at the state of our country today. I sincerely feel that this book educates and evokes new sense of understanding of our nation today. This book also demonstrates how Lincoln's values and his understanding of our country is very much valid even today.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus just knows how to make good music. Even though Morning View is not another SCIENCE, its a great album. And I don't know how you can call this album soft. Sure its not has hard or fast as old incubus, but its not soft. Morning View is a more upbeat uplifting album, but it does have some heavy and hard rifts in it. The lyrics sound great as well, and it has some addictive hooks in it.<br /><br />I hate when people get stuck on a certain style a band might have had at one point. All bands go though different phases in their music, and Incubus is no different. I'll be the first too admitt that the old incubus albums rocked, I loved the funk style that made SCIENCE so great. But I also appreciate the new incubus, Make Yourself and now Morning View are both great albums.<br /><br />This is a more mature sounding Incubus, and it is something different from Brandon and the guys. I personally am glad Morning View is not a retread of SCIENCE or Make Yourself. Fortunatly for us, Incubus is not a band that continues to pump out the same album over and over again. They do what they should, and thats make a different soundng album every time, and they are great at it. I'd rank this as one of my top 3 Incubus albums, the other two being SCIENCE and Make Yourself.<br /><br />Anyways, I find this to be a really well made album. Many of the songs could be singles, and it's very diverse album that can appeal to alot of different people. I bought this album when it came out in 2001, and I'm still listening to it today, in 2006. I think that speaks for itself as to how good it is. Bottom line is that morning view is a great album and has alot to offer.
0060254920|5.0|Maurice Sendak won the Caldecott Award for the illustrations for  this book, and it is a well-deserved award!  Children have fertile imaginations, and this book allows them to visualize the imagination of Max in his trip to the land of The Wild Things. A good book for story time, and for later reading alone.
0316172324|4.0|The intention of this book was never to teach the reader a new way of thinking or to revolutionize the way decisions are made, but rather to teach us about something most of us do everyday without realizing it.  <br /> <br />The analysis he offers through the perspectives of research experts, recent current events, and even our perceptions on our most popular beverages/food is eye opening! There are simple decisions being made by our mind far in advance of the rest of our consciousness, yet it shapes how we think food tastes, whether we will like a person or not, or even our thoughts on racism.  <br /> <br />I reccomend this book to anyone willing to read a simplified analysis of a very complicated decision making machine (the mind). Even with no prior interest in psychology or social sciences I was intrigued the entire way through, and have been made an instant fan of Malcolm Gladwell!
0451169514|5.0|A book that enables you to travel back in time...back to 1958, back to a time when there was Stan, Mike, Richie, Bev, Eddie, Ben and Big Bill and some others...back when some kids' main concern was avoiding Henry Bowers!<br /><br />A story that, although long...over a thousand pages and in 'IT' years probably much longer, kept my attention throughout. Maybe you'll remember what it was like to cycle so fast that your feet lose contact with the pedals...the determination and camaraderie of building a clubhouse, the friendship and love that can overwhelm you when you least expect it to and the fear...fear of the unknown...and fear of the known.<br /><br />A chilling yet absorbing novel that takes time to aquaint you with the characters and their experiences, so that you really care what happens to them - good AND bad!
B0000TB01Y|4.0|If you want to hear the music from Wicked, this is currently about the only way to do it short of buying another theater ticket.  And most of Stephen Schwartz's music is worth hearing: \\"Popular\\" is cleverly catchy; \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" is poignantly simple; \\"Defying Gravity\\" is a worthy showstopper; and \\"For Good\\" is destined to be heard at high school graduations for years to come.  Some of the other songs are forgettable at best and annoying at worst, but at least they serve to move the story along.  Winnie Holzman's book may not be as intriguing as Gregory Maguire's novel, but it's a lot more enjoyable--especially as family fare.  The main problem with this recording is that while Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth may have looked like complete opposites onstage, without the green makeup and blonde wig, their voices are difficult to distinguish.  Joel Grey would have been a better wizard with better material, and Carole Shelley might have been a more magical Madame Morrible had she done more than conjure memories of Hermione Gingold.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Cut from the same cloth as TOOM and L&T, Modern Times demonstrates classy professional musicianship from start to finish. As other reviewers have noted Bob's back-up band for this recording is the same lineup as his touring band. Man these cats are tight! If you've ever had the pleasure of seeing them perform live you can see the telepathic interplay so the same song never sounds the same twice...<br /><br />  But it's the videos on the \\"deluxe\\" edition that I come here to review. I ordered the deluxe edition because I've always believed that there is no such thing as having \\"too many Dylan videos\\". Maybe I was wrong about that. I'll grant that the vids are excellent. But none of them are new, none are contemporary with this album. None were \\"specially produced\\". BLOOD IN MY EYES is a beautiful, artsy, B&W promo for the \\"World Gone Wrong\\" album. It actually got airplay on VH-1. The Oscar winning THINGS HAVE CHANGED can be found in the special features for the DVD release of \\"The Wonder Boys\\". The Grammy winning LOVE SICK has been available on the net for years (as have the other vids). What makes LOVE SICK interesting is that idiot geek \\"Soy Bomb\\" who disrupted the performance has been edited out via cgi...! Finally COLD IRONS BOUND can claim some degree of uniqueness as those few of us who actually watched \\"Masked and Anonymous\\" were teased with only portions of the performance.<br /><br />  Mind you, I'm not knocking this album. I gave it 5 stars and would give it 7 stars if I could. The packaging is lovely, appealing to the eye and is somewhat durable. The music is nothing less than inspired and proves \\"that he not busy being born is busy dying\\". My only regret, vids aside, is that I had to wait 5 years to get it!<br /><br />  Enough other reviewers have provided track-by-track reviews of each song so I shan't waste any more of your time (\\"as if time were worth it's weight in gold\\"). Thanks for taking the time to read this.
B00006CXSS|5.0|When I first watched this series, on HBO, I found myself comparing it to Saving Private Ryan (also outstanding).  In doing so, B.O.B., at first viewing didn't compare, in my opinion.  However, upon watching B.O.B. a second and third time, my opinion did an, 'about face' (no pun intended).  I now condsider B.O.B. to be on of the all time great WW-II epics. While it didn't unseat my all time favorite, \\"12 O-Clock High\\" it now runs a close second.
B00005AQF7|2.0|I don't think the music on this disc does a very good job mixing rap with funk.  I think it's more along the lines of straight up rap.  I could be wrong, and I probably am seeing as how everyone would disagree with me (that's usually a good sign I'm wrong).  I have to stand by what I think, though.
0099450259|5.0|I really liked that it was 'Christopher's book' we were reading. It made me view things I do naturally as part of social communication, such as laughing to put someone at ease, in a totally different way. Actions like that or touching someone in a friendly manner has a completely different effect on Christopher.<br /><br />Christopher is a really likable character and you can sympathise with his confusion in this mixed up, top speed world we live in and understand his actions totally, yet at the same time we could understand the thoughts and reactions that strangers showed.<br /><br />He's such a thinker too and I loved his thoughts on metaphors being lies \\"...a pig is not like a day and people do not have skeletons in their cupboards.\\" and different facial expressions and how they can mean so many different things...I found myself trying them out! :D<br /><br />Although I don't have a family member with Asperger's, I do have a brother who is special like Christopher and I could certainly relate to the need for organisation and routine in his life and there were many points in the book that made me smile.<br /><br />Haddon helps us view situations from all points of view and it was refreshing.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love Pride and Prejudice (the novel and the A&E miniseries) most ardently. Joe Wright's adaptation will likely disturb Austenites, so consider yourselves warned and need not watch :) I believe it is also pointless to compare a 2-hr adaptation to any of the 4 1/2 hr versions. So, if you get over that and you would like  a movie to entertain you with breathtaking cinematography, adorable updated dialogues, deft acting, and a musical score that inspires without being overwhelming, then this is for you.  <br /> <br />The central cast is younger than previous adaptations but equally brilliant. Knightley truly has Elizabeth's  \\"fine eyes,\\" but not distractingly beautiful, expressive but not deliberate. MacFadyen unfolded Darcy's in a compelling manner; proud but endearingly awkward, confident yet reticent, elegant yet subtly sexy (and I love, love, love his eyes). <br /> <br />Cons: 1. the heavy reliance of the film to imagery and nuances (in the novel and in other adaptations, most of the P and P elements are presented as dialogues; follow the camera's movement and be very observant!) <br />3. use of the napoleonic era timeline, as oppose to the more aesthetic victorian era backdrop that P and P fans have gotten used to <br /> <br />Pros: 1. use of the napoleonic era timeline; makes the film less stodgy, less pompous, more grounded <br />2. fresh take on the classic but most romantic; the display of emotions are more intense  (a more spirited Elizabeth, a less elegant Darcy-in-love; Jane is less sedate and a fleeting scene that shows Bingley reaching for Jane's dress, desperate for any form of physical contact) <br />3. a sense of urgency was captured without the abuse of a nattering Mrs. Bennet <br />4. my favorite: unusual for his countenance, Mr. Darcy comes out disheveled in his night clothes and desperately seeks Elizabeth through the mist. It is a powerful show of yearning that romantics will find gratifying <br /> <br />I find most happy endings in romantic films to be contrived, but this is one romantic film where I found myself hoping and staying for the kiss. <br />
B000FQJAIW|2.0|This is not a review of the the Star Wars films. I thought the original trilogy was quite good entertainment, The Empire Strikes Back stands out as a very well made film from a dramatic standpoint. The prequel trilogy is much maligned but should not be so hated. Yes, The Phantom Menace is garbage, but the other two are passable, even fun genre-films.  <br /> <br />The point of the matter is that we all know that George Lucas is not primarily a filmmaker, he is instead a businessman. He put together a business model for success, milking his beloved Star Wars for all it's worth for three decades now! His children will continue his revolting capitalist legacy and so will their children. It's up to you, dear consumer, to put an end to his diabolical, imperialistic machinations that have sucked money from your pocket for years on end. Be wise like Yoda, don't buy anymore George Lucas product until he realizes that consumers should be treated with some respect at the very least. It's true that humanity is made up of not people, but \\"sheeple\\" and that the stupid masses will continually be enslaved if they do not think for themselves. Wasn't that one of the primary ideas behind the Star Wars films? George Lucas will forever play tricks on the minds of the weak, using his \\"force\\" to extract a few dollars from their pockets. <br /> <br />I say forget Star Wars! You love movies? Type in Criterion Collection into the amazon search engine and see the wide world of cinema available at your fingertips. Go rent some of those films and stop sending big paychecks to the Sith Lord Lucas. <br /> <br />This latest ploy of releasing the originals on DVD in their original versions is another in the long line of schemes that Lucas has been slowly plotting. Soon there will be more and more DVDs, HD-DVDs, Blu-Ray discs, 3D cinematic releases and special, special, special editions. Come on George, make a new film for godsakes, in the manner of THX-1138, do something artsy again! When did youlose your vision and become a capitalist pig? It's not too late to make amends and change! <br /> <br />I have never bought a Star Wars film on DVD or VHS, never bought a happy meal, action figure, video game, comic book, pillow case, article of clothing or any other merchandise associated with Star Wars. I prefer to keep the films in my memory, untainted by frivolous, sickening consumerism which will never end since it is the lifeblood that sustains George Lucas.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out and have not listened to anything else since. I have heard it compared to Love and Theft and Time out of Mind. However, this album also reminded me a great deal of Oh, Mercy.  <br />One of my favorite songs is Thunder on the Mountain. If you like Political World you will like this song. Another favorite is Ain't Talkin'. This is the the most haunting, unflinching, stark, and unappologetic song I have heard. Over the Horizon is souds a lot like Bye and Bye, and Workin' Man Blues sounds a lot like Mississippi.  <br />    There are a few songs that I am not fond of...yet. However, the strong ones are STRONG. This album is worth buying. Get the one with the DVD if you can, it is well worth it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Wow, people are stupid. Out of boredom I decide to rate the best collection by The Beatles out there, and some stupid reviewers compare them, or rather, attempt to compare them to bands such as Metallica? What is that crap? The Beatles pretty much own all other music from the mid-60's onward, and are in some way responsible for all music that spawned after their breakup due to their incredible influence. They are the most influential group of all time. Now, some teeny bopper has enough nerve to compare them to Metallica? Metallica is a good band, don't get me wrong, but The Beatles own them. Period, no questions asked. John Lennon and Paul McCartney are among the brightest lyricists of all time. Lets see Hetfield top Happiness is a Warm Gun. Bottom line: people like GIRL OF THE WORLD are just stupid. If they are going to go out of their way to insult a band such as The Beatles in favor of a much inferior one such as Metallica, then they don't even deserve to listen to The Beatles. I'm 15 years old. I've got a big poster of John Lennon on my wall, I ask him for advice sometimes, haha. I own every Beatles studio album and there isn't a day that goes by where I don't listen to at least one of them. I'm speaking for my generation, my friends. Every song on Beatles 1 is excellent. There is a reason they topped the charts, so if you're thinking about listening to the negative reviews, don't. Everyone likes The Beatles. Most people just don't know it yet.
038572179X|5.0|I just can't say enough how much I loved this book. I can without a doubt say it is one of the best I've ever read. The story is engrossing, and the prose is incredibly evocative. The beginning does start a bit slowly, but I found that the prose was so smooth that I had no problem continuing reading. But if you are feeling that it is a bit slow, stay with it for at least 100 pages. By that point I was not even aware of myself flipping pages, I was so wrapped up in the story and the characters' fates. This is best read without knowing anything about the plot. I'll just say that there are plenty of plot turns that were completely unpredictable to me, right up until the last page of the book.  The conclusion left me totally satisfied and I couldn't get this book out of my head for long after I finished it. There are many layers to this novel.  This was the first book I've read by this author. I am eagerly anticipating reading more of his works.
0930289234|5.0|This is really a great graphic novel, with quite a payoff of an ending.  I wont make this wordy because most of the reviews on here say all that needs to be said.  Its great, if you like comics buy it.  I will say this though, I really loved the character of Rorschach! He was such an intriquing character...I dont know hw to explain it so you'll just have to read it and see for yourself.  Anyways I thought about this story for days after I read it, if that tells you how good it is.
B000002KHH|2.0|Will everyone stop acting like they started metal and that the're a bunch of geniuses. LED ZEPPELIN IS THE KING OF IT ALL. The only reason people act like Sabbath is so good is because they hear other people say so and hop on the bandwagon instead of judging for themselves. I'm not saying that they're the worst band in the world but can we please stop worshipping them. DAMN YOU MTV!!! <br /> <br />As for the album, it's kinda decent but certainly not the work of geniuses.
0440539811|5.0|A damned good book for those who likes to test their mind. It is like a psykological hallucinogetic trip within ones mind. <br />  This is the second time i read this book and I am still amazed by all their knowledge(shea and wilson) and their great imagination. The Illuminatus is a compilation of all \\"the great thinkers\\" theories and all religions and beliefs. In short: It is a mind expantion pack. <br />  Read it, and think for yourself!
B00005ATQM|5.0|I'm reviewing the DVD-A, to which this listing refers. Given the 5 stars above, it's already clear that I like it. <br /> <br />So here's the specifics: I've had a fairly high-end sound system installed in my home so that the room in which I watch movies, television, music videos, etc., has the best possible audio effect. Because we all know that Jurassic Park just isn't Jurassic Park without the amazing sound design, and at full blast. <br /> <br />Believe me, this is why Metallica released a DVD-A of the Black Album. <br /> <br />When anyone comes over to check out the sound system, you can bet that this is the DVD-A that goes on in my media room. And the opening of \\"Enter Sandman\\" absoultely rips the paint off the wall. <br /> <br />Frankly, if you don't have a 5.1 surround sound system (or better) then there is no reason to purchase this version of the Black Album. But if you do, you can't not own this. It's so big, so thunderous, so absolutely monstrous in sound that you just can't believe your ears. It's revelatory in the difference between this version and all prior versions. Frankly, when they mastered the original 1991 release, I doubt they imagined it sounding this good.  <br /> <br />Seriously, it's so good that if you don't have a 5.1 system set up this DVD-A is good enough to justify buying one- plus an official DVD-A player to go with it. Then you can get on with purchasing other brilliant remasters by Fleetwood Mac, REM, the Steve Miller Band and the like. But really this is ground zero.
0782008119|4.0|This film is very important to understand the Seattle Sound and the musical movement in the last decade. PEARL JAM sounds very good playing \\"Not For you\\". There a a lot of great performances of Mudhoney, Fastbacks, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, etc.Also There are interviews with Eddie Vedder, Charles Peterson (ex subpop photographer), Mark Arm, etc.<br /><br />I recomend this film for everyone.
0060527978|4.0|I read this soon after I was touched by The Alchemist. <br /> <br />First of all, I don't think we could make direct comparison with the Alchemist. The writing style is totally different. Those looking for an inspiring \\"story\\" like Alchemist will be disappointed. Rather, think of WotL as collection of a wise uncle/mentor advices. If you are familiar with Mahabharata, think of it like Bhagavad Gita episode of the epic, where Krishna passed down his wisdom to the doubting Arjuna. <br /> <br />Carl Jung suggested that there are universal \\"archetypes\\" that all mankind can relate to create meaning of their life. This is exactly how to read WotL: see yourself in the shoes of a \\"warrior\\" on the quest to his dream, plunge yourself in the archetype, then it will make sense. If you still put on that urban city slicker hat and look for instant enlightment, you won't get it. You should read Dr. Phil or Anthony Robbins instead.
B00006CXSS|5.0|One of the best movie series I've seen. Very detail oriented <br />Great job by everyone - especially when you listen to the original survivors
B000BYRCH4|4.0|3 stars for the movie, plus a bonus star to the director for being a genius.  How you ask?  It's all about Paul Walker.  Man do I love that guy.  Absolute worst actor in Hollywood, but still gets part after part.  His acting style is like a piece of wood with constipation.  But he's just bad enough to be lovable.  People still like him despite his failing, not like Hayden Christenson (Anakin from Star Wars), who just needs to die. <br /> <br />Anyways, so the director is sitting and thinking: \\"Hmmm... Paul Walker's in this movie.  How do I distract people from his god awful acting enough so they'll still like it?\\"  Then the answer hits him like a sledge hammer to the head.  Get a super ridiculously hot woman to play along side him!  Enter Jessica Alba.  In a bikini.  Think any guy is watching Paul Walker any more?  And that handles half the audience at least. <br /> <br />Now if that isn't enough, we also have pirates, sharks, mantas, and other sea creatures who consequently get addicted to cocaine, and lots of underwater shots of our illustrious stars diving for treasure / drugs.  Also, putting Paul Walker underwater for much of the film erases the need for him to talk.  Bonus!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|There are probably too many reviews of Modern Times out there already. If you read them you will learn that Modern Times is the sequel to Love and Theft, or the last part of a trilogy beginning with Time Out of Mind. Or maybe it's the prequel to Slow Train Coming, which itself was a rehearsal for Nashville Skyline. Modern Times really deserves to be met on its own terms. The record crackles with energy and passion, it leaps with new twists on old formulas, it's very funny when it's funny, and its poetry is unforced and plainspoken. And the title isn't a conundrum or a joke. Dylan has read a bit of philosophy and knows when \\"modern times\\" began, and that all recorded music is modern. According to Chronicles, Voltaire and Rousseau were once so close to him it was as if they lived in his back yard. On this album he sings a few blues for them, just for the road.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|He's still putting us on, of course -- the Grisled, Broken-Hearted Cowpoke Drifter routine is about as authentic as Ziggy Stardust. So it's a good thing his Muse is speaking to him again (albeit through her lawyer, but hey -- at least there's some sort of dialogue taking place.)  You'd be forgiven for wondering why Bob didn't just cut the oh-so-cryptic Chaplin subplot monkeyshines and just go ahead and title this tasty platter \\"Love and Theft II\\".  And you'd also be forgiven for feeling maybe just the slightest nuance of disappointment at that notion.
038533348X|4.0|Didn't know what to expect.  Thought it might be difficult reading for some reason.  Turns out it was pretty easy.  I guess it just gives you a lot to think about instead of looking up words and things like that.  I think it could have been a 4.5-5 star book if the story would have been expanded upon to at least 500pp, or at least long enough to develop the characters.
B00000JNNY|4.0|What an amazing collection of songs, sung with richness and clarity by one of the most distingushable voices.  I used \\"At Last\\" at my recent wedding and the title song was what played <br />as I walked down the aisle to meet my husband.  Everyone complimented my choice of music.  The rest of the cd played at  <br />our reception and everybody just loved it.
0452270073|5.0|Upon first examination, the book Regeneration by Pat Barker appears to be completely about the war poet and hero, Siegfried Sassoon. It was more or less a logical conclusion, considering that the \\"brilliant\\" Dr. William Rivers is only mentioned in a single sentence on the back page, almost as if he is the antagonist. I was very surprised, then, to find that the book was not exclusively about Sassoon. It wasn't even mostly about Sassoon - it's not even told from his point of view the majority of the time. Rather, the story follows a certain period of Dr. Rivers' life, the period in which Sassoon is involved. It starts with his reading Sassoon's Declaration, and ends with him writing his conclusions about Sassoon's stay.  <br /> <br />With Dr. Rivers as its protagonist, then, the story follows him as he treats his patients, officers who have been rendered \\"mentally unsound\\" (as Sassoon was classified) by the brutal effects of the war, young men with stutters, who suffer from horrible nightmares, who believe they are paralyzed when there's nothing wrong with them, who are mute. Using his unique method of encouraging his patients to remember and cope with their war experience in order to eventually heal - rather than helping them to repress the ideas, as the men have often been taught - Dr. Rivers slowly but steadily progresses with his patients so that they are soon ready to enter life again and return to the front, or get a job doing war paperwork, or occasionally return to their families. <br /> <br />But the difference of Sassoon's case forces Dr. Rivers to really think once more about the justness of continuing the war, of all those questions which, as a doctor treating daily the patients that he does, he must consider, but as a citizen, he must file away in order to continue his job. Throughout the course of the book, he deals not only with his own opinions about the war, but with his own health, ailing from the stressful lifestyle he lives, with his desires to pursue the research profession he held before the war, and with the ethics of his own methodology and those of other respected doctors, who, for the sake of a faster cure and a voracious ego, might pay less attention to the pain or feelings of the patient while performing a \\"miraculous\\" cure. <br /> <br />Regeneration, then, is much more than a war novel. It is a study in human nature, an examination of those things which we use to define ourselves and the people around us, and of how an event like WWI can change all that dramatically. <br />
0670824399|5.0|I'm 26 years old, and this story is still dear to my heart. I read it every now and then, and it makes me feel so good inside. Matilda is such a sweet child and I adore reading her story.
B00005JLWN|5.0|When action leaped up in mid air and dance like fighting sequences splattered on my screen, the first question I asked myself was \\"How come I have never heard of this movie before?\\"  It came and went into the movie theaters like a hushed shadow, yet hundreds of outstanding five star reviews prove it was well received and it did not slip by silently. <br /> <br />One can easily assume that Equilibrium is just another action movie, but this hybrid of marital art styles, refined weaponry and stunning fight scenes reached deeper than many movies I've seen of serious topics and non frills entertainment. This movie reminded me of movies such as Kill Bill, V for Vendetta, Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet,  yet the story and theme touched on the rawest foundations of humanity.  <br /> <br />In the future as wars threatened mankind , drugs replaced all feeling and emotions. There was no art, no books, no fancy clothes, only sterile solemn looking houses and no individuality whatsoever, people looked like they stepped out of an assembly line at a factory. A totalitarian society ruled by a man called Father and his high officials distributed a drug which upon injection sustained the feeling of nothingness. Amongst that society there were real people, those who hid or ran away and tired to keep some of their possessions with them, but they were at risk of an instant and brutal death if found by the Grammaton Clerics, a breed of super cops who sniff out the fugitives. It is amazing what they did in the name of peace, how many people they killed and murdered, makes on think about what is right and what is wrong but carries a good name. <br /> <br />One day John Preston (Christian Bale) skips a dose and notices undesirable to him effects taking place. He uses his excellent combat skills to trace reasons of why he should not take it and of what the truth really holds. The story as far fetches as it was, was fun and witty and did not take a trilogy to portray it's message. It was a scary glimpse into the world where all feeling and emotions were suppressed, and when I left my boyfriends house after watching it I thought that the air never smelled so good and the world never looked so fresh before. It made me value the kind of freedom I complain about daily, as non perfect as it is, it sure is better than the life Preston had. <br /> <br />There were many twists and turns to the story, secret traitors and hidden agendas and I loved solving it with Preston.  The icing on the cake was the fighting, especially when he used his guns as swords, I real treat to watch! This is a must have movie in anyone's library, especially for action buffs! <br /> <br />- Kasia S.
B000GIXLO8|1.0|This is an awful attempt at nothing but to try and squeeze more money from fans who just flock to the words \\"limited edition\\". Save your money. There is no reason to buy these. At all. No DTS, no commentaries. Capitalism at it finest.
B000FZETIO|4.0|The big deal about this disc is we were supposed to see the original, lost ending, at least as a deleted scene.  I was under that impression anyway.  Ummm, we never see it.  We see a picture of it.  We see it being filmed (for a couple seconds), from a behind the scenes camera.  But do we see the original ending.  No.  Unless I'm missing something, it isn't here. <br /> <br />Still no trailer either.  :( <br /> <br />The documentary is fairly decent.  I was concerned when I saw the word \\"featurettes\\" on the box.  But these are basically individual chapters of a 5-6 part making-of.  Matter of fact, the actual \\"Making of\\" chapter isn't as good as some of the others. <br /> <br />I have yet to watch the commentary.  I read it's a little slow at times but ... most are. <br /> <br />At $10, I can't complain.
B0009X7664|5.0|The Legacy Series Edition of To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent DVD set.  In addition to the classic movie (which we never tire of), the special features are very interesting, including interviews with \\"Scout\\" (Mary Badham), and \\"Atticus Finch\\".  It is easy to understand why Gregory Peck is so revered and respected as an actor. <br /> <br />To Kill a Mockingbird is an enduring classic, a moral lesson, as well as an entertaining story.  We highly recommend this DVD set.
B000FZETIO|1.0|SHAME ON PARAMOUNT! The Everything's Duckie Edition totally fails to deliver on the hype. We were cheated for the sake of false marketing! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE if you think your 20 year wait to see Duckie get the girl is about to pay off because it's not! They talk about \\"the original ending\\" but never show it. The richies got richer and I'm still lost looking for \\"The Lost Dance\\"!  I'm so mad I could puke on my duck shoes!
B00005JOVH|1.0|It seems this movie was pieced together with a bunch of unfinished scenes, a botch job that ruined all the major characters. Character development? More like character destruction... <br /> <br />It made me angry as I watched it. What a joke...
B0000DC14V|4.0|Marlon Brando wrote and produced this western epic filmed on the California coast, most notably in Pebble Beach and Monterey before much of the current development.  Brando and his co-star, Carl Malden, are in their prime in this film about two bandits on the run from the law.  Rio (Brando) ends up getting caught and going to prison in Sonora.  Dad (Malden) escapes and betrays Rio.  He ultimately turns respectable and becomes the sherrif of a small town.  When Rio escapes from prison, he sets out for revenge.<br /><br />Malden is particularly good in this film.  His homely intensity plays well against the Brando's concentrated sensuality.  The chemistry between the two men is mesmerizing.  Ultimately it is a tale of redemption, since Brando must leave his wicked ways in order to be worthy of a respectable woman's love.  This is a terrific western that is now classic but must have been very unusual for its time.

B000G7PMD2|5.0|I'm sure there will be many complaints with the setlist (no \\"hits\\") but how many live versions of \\"Pull Me Under\\" and \\"Take The Time\\" do we need? Instead Dream Theater deliver a history lesson of mostly deep album cuts and 2 unreleased cuts. As other reviewers have noted James Labrie is spot on for the entire performance (and let's face it he usually is hit and miss).  The musicianship, as always, is top notch and Jordan Rudess continues to prove he's the best keyboardist DT has ever had. I recommend picking up the DVD as well with the \\"Score So Far\\" documentary.
0156012197|5.0|This is one of those books that you have to read during your lifetime.  And re-read, as often as needed.  The beauty of this story is its truth, and vice versa.  I treasure this book so much, that although I recommend it often, I will never lend it out.  Don't go through life with reading it!!
0743201140|4.0|Great insights to your strengths, but somewhat complex with the descriptors of the 32 possibilities.  At least you don't have to read through them all...just your own 5 dominant strengths.

Her other books cover mostly one type, this is packed.<br /><br />I can't give you any more details because I didn't purchase this to learn her technique; I am a watercolorist and was looking to see if she had any interesting movements of the brush that I haven't seen yet.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|What more could a romantic at heart ask for? I love to laugh and love, so I thoroughly enjoyed the movie the whole way through! If you are trying to decide if this movie is worth watching, it is a must see! Especially for the price!
0345350499|1.0|<br />After seeing this book receive a 4 1/2 star rating with some 840 reviews I decided to give this review to try to even things out.   <br /> <br />Where to begin? <br /> <br />First off, what are these people thinking?  This book didn't have the semblance of being anything close to good!  The prose was at best dull, at worst laborious -  I wasn't even able to finish the book!  I wasn't interested!  The women are freakin' evil.  When I heard about the book, I thought that it was such a great idea I couldn't wait to read it.  After the initial story of Igraine wherein they're obsessed about sex (which is really throughout the entire book) and she neglects her children to spend all her time with some big jock guy who she purportedly spent her past life with in Atlantis (!) the story just plummets.  The women are constantly conscious of stupid crap like the perkiness of their breasts when the men are around are how Morgause's hair is still red after all these years.  Ah, but they sell henna, says Morgaine, whose character *Sucks*!  She is incessantly obsessed over how small and dark she is (supposedly she is of the lineage of the original inhabitants of the British Isles) and lusts after her cousin her whole life.  There is so much about this book that is bad, it's hard to even remember it all.  And the ONLY part of the book that was any good was when Morgaine gets lost in Fairy Land, which she doesn't even like!  So when she gets knocked up by her brother and the Fairy Queen offers to take the child to fairyland where it will have a happy and productive life, she refuses only to forsake the child herself and let her sister raise him.  This is all not to mention Gwenhyfar.  Oh my god, can these characters get any worse?!  Just when I thought it had got really bad, Zimmerman introduces Gwenhyfar.  Something of an agoraphobe, (not to mention christian zealot) we finally find out after hundreds of pages and many years in the book that after all this time of her beingafraid to go outside she's actually nearsighted!!  Nearsighted!!  She couldn't even stand the curtains being up she was so terrified of open spaces because of some nearsightedness??!  Awful story!  Just terrible.  The only character with any sense was Morgause but she is secretly despised by the other weakling female characters.  This is an awful retelling of the Arthurian legends.  Zimmerman should be ashamed and fired by her publisher but instead people apparently like, I mean *really* like crap like this so she went on to write even more of this junk! <br /> <br />I am appalled.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I received the item on time and in excellent condition.
B00007AJF8|3.0|Over the weekend I watched this movie. 10 mins into the movie and I was reminded of 'I heart Huckabees' and somewhat of 'Garden State'. Abstract, Comic in a different way, not in ur face kinda humour and quite insightful too content wise and full marks to the fresh treatment of the film as a whole. No rules here for a typical mainstream cinema.    Craig Schwartz (John Cusak) has such an unusual career of a struggling puppeteer. He getting a job as a filer based on his fast fingers skill in an office, which is on a 7-1/2 floor and everyone inside that office, walks with a crouch (no option there) and all this in the name of 'lower heads'. Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) is an overly-animal friendly (is visible in her appearance too) person and they've quite a few different kinds of animals in their house who freely move about in their bedrooms, kitchen, watch tv together etc. Craig's colleague (Catherine Keener) is a sassy woman with prevalent opportunist traits and John Malkovich playing himself.    All of the above is on surface, a little deeper and all its quirkiness starts making sense.  The puppeteer theme had to do with manipulation, both with puppets and with real people. Everyone was manipulated in this film, and different people pulled the strings at different times. It also had to do with what it means to be a celebrity and about their real `identity'. Also tackles the hidden desires, be it sex or be it wanting to be someone else. Never satisfied with what we are and what we get is right described when Craig says, \\"Consciousness is a terrible curse - I think; I feel; I suffer.\\"    There is no great start and end here or for that matter middle too, but it does have a strong central point to make and once you see through this point with an open mind, then it's a smooth enjoyable ride!    The director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman (Oscar for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) both bring a certain quirkiness to the table by their past work and when combined can only give more quirky results. After this they worked together for Adaptation and currently working on Synecdoche, New York (future release).     Now do I see myself running for a copy of `Adaptation' in my nearby blockbuster shop?!

1592402038|5.0|If you've been wanting to brush up on your grammar, but you just can't make it through a chapter of Hodges' Harbrace, this is the perfect book. However, if you already know your grammar, you may disagree with some of Truss's more controversial stances on the nuances of grammar (such as saying Truss' instead of Truss's). If you are required to adhere to a specific style guide, then by all means, consult it and not this book. The APA Publican Manual disagrees with Truss on the subject of hyphens, apostrophes, and other matters of great grammatical importance.  <br /> <br />The bottom line: you will learn or re-learn some things, but not all of grammar is set in stone. But whatever your reasons for picking up this book, you are sure to be entertained!
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|Sounds like Zeppelin? Sabbath? Deep Purple? Dear God, not at all. These guys couldn't hold a candle to those legendary talents. The lyrics for these songs have got to be the WORST I've heard in a long time, and sound like they were written by some immature 14-year old boy without a vocabulary. \\"She's a woman, you know what I mean/You better listen, listen to me.\\" What? You gotta be kidding me. All the songs are like this. Total cheese. So many corny, cliche lines. Ugh... <br /> <br />However, the music itself is this album's saving grace. It's catchy and played well. But please, stop comparing the songs to classic rock greats. Overall, if the band's lyricist was even half-way creative, this would be a good, solid album, because the music itself is fun to listen to. But the lyrics just kill it for me. However, if you're looking for good, driving, cheese rock to tap your foot to, then this album is for you. <br /> <br />PS -- Even the opening scream on the song is horrible. I think even the singer knows it...if you listen closely it sounds like he's laughing at the end.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Lucas's \\"special edition\\" of the orgignal Star Wars (A New Hope) was a mixed bag. On the one hand, it did a great job of making the special effects better. The attack on the Death Star, for example, is much more impressive in the updated film. But at the same time, Lucas did a number of dumb things: Greedo shooting first, the Jabba scene, etc.<br /><br />What I would really like is a vesion of the original film, without the changes and additional scenes (or maybe just the Biggs scene, though that's not a big deal), but with the cleaned-up effects.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I like this show, its a blend of horror, action, thrills, chills, and sometimes its wickedly funny. I have watched every episode of the first season on The WB(soon to be called The CW). Its about two brothers named Sam and Dean. They have lost contact with their father and they go and search for him, one day when Sam comes home after a long weekend with his brother he feels that something is just not right, he goes into his room and realizes that his girlfriend, Jessica is dead. He gets so freaked out and he wants to know what happened to his girlfriend. So Sam and Dean go on a very long road trip stopping in various towns with strange things going on and stop it. In the end they always win.  <br /> <br />The shows writers have used classic urban legends like Mary, Bloody Mary and The Scarecrow as well as a bunch of their own. Its really cool. I'm glad to know that they have renewed the show for another season and I just cant wait to watch the season premiere, last season left a big cliffhanger. This show is really cool for horror buffs. Catch \\"Supernatural\\" on The CW network on Thursday nights starting in September at nine o'clock.

B000GRTQSE|4.0|I picked this cd up last night and I wasn't sure if I was going to get the scratchy vocals that I've come to expect and loved.To my surprise I received a collection of smooth old town blues,much like his older stuff.Every track is a pleasure with maybe one or two that was trance inducing but thats bound to happen sometimes.With songs like The Levee's Gonna Break and Working Mans Blues to glide things along.When the Deal Goes Down is an easy piece that sways into your head. Over all Bob Dylan continues to show no sign of putting down the guitar any time soon......And thats a good sign! A great album!
B000GFLKF8|3.0|I watched this movie through twice, and then a third time with director Spike Lee's commentary. And I still don't quite get it. It seems to be a table full of pieces that just don't fit together. <br /> <br />For example, what was Jodi Foster doing in this movie? What did her character accomplish? What did Christopher Plummer get, or think he had gotten, when he handed that check over to her? She doesn't seem to perform any function here, other than to cut a fine female figure. <br /> <br />It seems we have a lot of A-List stars strutting their stuff, in search of a logical script. Denzel Washington basically reprises his role as Malcolm X. Well, he's a hostage negotiator here rather than a civil rights leader. But he stands and delivers with the same quick, snappy patter. He strides down the street with the same confident air, right down to the way he shears the brim of his hat jauntily into place.  <br /> <br />Jodi Foster may uncharacteristically play a character of dubious morality in this film. But she tackles her assignment with characteristic intelligence and command. In the same way, most of the actors are playing to type, and do not stretch beyond their usual projections. They all meet in the arena of this bank hesit in the personas we have come to associate with them. But these good actors don't form an ensemble. They aren't given a logical reason for occupying the same screen space. <br /> <br />I said that this movie was like a jigsaw puzzle with some pieces missing. Actually, it's worse. The pieces we have are colorful shards that form some interesting patterns as they twist and turn. But they ultimately seem to come from several different pictures altogether. <br /> <br />The whole movie is like its concluding music. As the closing credits roll, we hear a rap song juxtaposed against a Bollywood ditty that I guarantee you won't be able to get out of your head. They are both good pieces of music. But they have no logical reason for being stuck together here - other than the fact that they both must have struck Spike Lee's fancy. <br /> <br />So ultimately this is a pack rat's nest of shiny baubles drawn from different places. Still, it's good to look at. <br />  <br />

0140157352|4.0|First, a testimonial.  When I was three-quarters of the way through, I had a whammy of a week.  On Monday I negotiated in a job interview, Tuesday I negotiated with my landlady, and Wednesday I negotiated with my manager over new job routines (the cause of my activities on Monday). I found the methods, strategies, approaches and techniques in the book IMMEDIATELY helpful in these situations.<br /><br />This is a helpful book, and groundbreaking. I say groundbreaking, because after the ground is broken, it needs to harrowed, hoed, watered, and planted. There is much work to do in this field.<br /><br />The book is wisely divided into two halves.  The first half (parts I and II) is negotiation with friendlies, the second half (III-V) is for adversaries and potential friendlies.  In some way, it may be better to read the second half first, where you have the techniques that break ground for the \\"real\\" negotiation.<br /><br />The content of this book is sound; however, there are deeper issues with prose and organization.  I think the worst offender is this one paragraph:<br /><br />\\"Any method of negotiation may be fairly judged by three criteria: It should produce a wise agreement if agreement is possible. It should be efficient. And it should improve or at least not damage the relationship between the parties. (A wise agreement can be defined as one that meets the legitimate interests of each side to the extent possible, resolves conflicting interests fairly, is durable, and takes community interests into account.)\\" (p. 4)<br /><br />This 72-word paragraph is awkward.  In reality, it is two run-on paragraphs.  A better rewrite, using 43 words, could be:<br /><br />\\"Any method of negotiation may be fairly judged by six criteria:<br /><br />* Meets the legitimate interests of each side<br /><br />* Resolves conflicting interests fairly<br /><br />* Is durable<br /><br />* Takes community interests into account.<br /><br />* Is efficient.<br /><br />* Improves the relationship between the parties.\\"<br /><br />The problem is that the phrase \\"wise agreement\\" is too big for a bullet point and too small to get the job done.  Furthermore I dropped the qualifiers--it is understood that no agreement will be platonically perfect. \\"A living dog is better than a dead lion.\\" (Ecclesiastes 9:4).  Since discussion about wise agreements comes later on (83-85), the paragraph could also be rewritten with 39 words:<br /><br />\\"Negotiations should be wise. This involves meeting the legitimate interests of each side, resolving interests fairly, being durable, and considering community interests. Additionally, it should be efficient and it should improve (or at least not damage) the parties' relationship.\\"<br /><br />Another drawback is repetition.  Chapter 2 focuses on the people problem in negation, but in chapter 3, which deals with redefining interests, the authors say be hard on problem, soft on people. This material was already covered in the previous chapter, and is redundant.<br /><br />I don't think this is an editorial problem. Rather, it is one of conceptualization.  I think it would be helpful to have a theoretician, logician, or a philosopher to go over the book, with the objective of reconstructing the book.  The problem is in organizing the parts into a coherent whole. Right now, it is a semi-coherent hole.e parties.\\" <br /> <br />The problem is that the phrase \\"wise agreement\\" is too big for a bullet point and too small to get the job done.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|We had rented this movie.  It set for a week before we decided to watch it; then we watched it again and realized it was a \\"keeper\\".  Great entertainment!
006056251X|4.0|However the WORST inside cover art I have seen in ages. Who are those people? They have nothing to do with the characters in the book.  And what's with describing the heroine as having \\"Glassy doll-like\\" eyes?? Gave me the creeps.
B000E5N62U|4.0|first of all, I should state that I am the number one Steely Dan fan in the world and yeah I know, this is a Fagen work. <br />when I first listened to this CD I was unimpressed.  same old same old.  But listen again (and again) and it will grow on you.  it will remind you of the days when you said to yourself \\"this band is *$%#@ good - i'm glad so-and-so (kathy) turned me on to them\\".  favorite track is \\"mary shut the garden door\\" - not because of the lyrics but because of the jazz. <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|when i first heard about this movie i was skeptical at best.  The fact that VII had been milked so hard for so many years led me to believe that this was just some poor excuse to beat the dead horse but i was quickly proven wrong.  Within the first half hour of the movie i was calling friends to tell them to buy it.  The action sequences are so intense that i found myself rewinding and slow-motioning every 5 seconds in order to see every single detail of what was happening. <br /> <br />as far as the story goes, I was impressed that it actually tied together what happened to Cloud after VII.  VII left me with a feeling of \\"wtf happened to the character that a just spent 50 hours playing as?\\"  but Advent CHildren closes the huge hole and explains how Cloud dealt with Aeris's death.   <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants closure for their time spent playing VII because it will be well worth the couple dollars you spend.  And by the way, the ending credits are the coolest of any movie i have ever seen in my 20+ years of watching movies
B000062YAZ|5.0|It is by far the best metal record of all time.  The music is timeless and is just as good today as it was released.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Okay, I have to admit, I bought this CD because of their hit \\"The Kill.\\"  (Awesome video!) That and the fact Jared Leto happens to be the front man, intrigued me.  I have to say, not only was I pleasantly surprised with their vibe, gift for music and variety of the songs, but I loved them all!<br /><br />This is a huge feat in today's \\"one-hit wonder\\" phenomenon.  I swear, every time I love a song and rush out and buy the cd, that one song I liked is the only good one on the entire album.  It's enough to make one go to downloading!<br /><br />However, this is not the case with 30 Seconds To Mars.  They have are a talented band, with a unique sound and great lyrics.  An overall winner, whose songs I find myself humming to myself all throughout the day.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.  As for me, I'm hoping they come out with a LIVE album soon...they rock on stage.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|A magnificent reproduction of a gone world.Not only a wonderful ambientation and marvelous scenes reflecting the english countryside of the 19th century but also a profound study of that period's moral and way of living with a very rigid society where women were condemned to stay alone if they hadn't a dought to offer, or at least stay poor if they didn't find a rich groom.We are lucky to live in a world with social mobility. <br />Very good actors
B00005JNRZ|4.0|The greatest thing about `Cars,' the latest film coming from Pixar, is its rich and beautiful colors of the picture. Even those who points out the weakness of the story (which resembles that of Michael J. Fox film `Doc Hollywood') would admit the merit. After all, you just cannot keep telling good stories with originality forever, and Pixar is no exception. In `Cars' the respected company has decided on seeking the originality in another direction, that is, the setting of the film, in which all the characters are really cars, trucks, or any vehicle you can see on the road. <br /> <br />That means you don't see any humans here. The hero of the film is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), hot shot race car who is stranded in the middle of nowhere, a sleepy town called Radiator Springs, after a series of incredible but funny misadventures. After damaging the town's main road, he is sentenced to community service in the court by Doc Hudson (voice by Paul Newman) while Lightning has to be in the next big race in California. <br /> <br />The town's `people' or cars are mostly misfits and rejects - the motif frequently used in Pixar films - and corky Lightning finds the life there miserable and hellish, but you know, people, no, cars change. <br /> <br />The film's idea about the cars and other vehicles is stretched to the point of some bizarre scenes - such as groupie cars, public restroom for cars, or car bugs that really fly - and you may not be impressed by all of them. Unlike `The Incredibles' or `Monster's Inc' the script of `Cars' is not the most original one in the marvelous history of Pixar, and the film's length (about 2 hours) makes us wish for the year 1995 when Pixar managed to make `Toy Story' that runs only 81 minutes and still is as good and enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Still brilliant images full of striking colors and wonderful designs would appeal to everyone. The speedy car race sequences are brilliantly done, and the designs of the deserted town of Radiator Springs are often astonishingly real. And in spite of the weak story, the characters themselves are all well-written and likable, as those in the previous Pixar films are. Maybe `Cars' failed to reach the high standard of recent animations that Pixar has been pushing higher and higher, but it is still entertaining with a bit of sentimental and nostalgic feeling.
B00005JOQT|5.0|I've been a great fan of Superman since i was a kid. Superman Returns is by far the best Superman Movie of all-time. <br /> <br />The action and special affects are very good. Ther story line is great. The movie was produced and directed with the up-most respect to the Superman legend. <br /> <br />I loved the acting and the story flow. Brandon did a great job playing Superman.  <br /> <br />Lois Lane is the great surprise of the movie. Kate Bodsworth you are beautiful. What a great Lois you played. <br /> <br />The best part of the movie was the love story behind Lois and Superman. This was a totally special treat for me. I think the director took some advise from his friend James Cameron (Titanic)while the script was being written. <br /> <br />Superman Returns is  #96 today, on the all-time worldwide money making films list. I think that says a lot about how good this movie really is. <br /> <br />I took my 10 year old granddaughter with me to see it and she said by far it was the best movie she had ever seen. <br /> <br />Thanks for making such and enjoyable film!!!!!!!

0064440346|5.0|My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves Lobel books and when I moved \\"up\\" from the ones in the Easy Fiction area of the library to the Easy - Reader ones I was very pleased as was she.  Very short, simple stories with a very clever and imaginative storyline.  Like Mousesoup and Mousetails, the stories are just simply good reading stories that my daughter loves hearing over and over and I dont tire of reading.
B0009UC810|4.0|\\"The Blues Brothers\\" is a film that has grown on me with repeated viewings. Even the first time I saw it I was enthralled by the opening and closing sections of the movie, and nearly punched the air at the perfection of the ending, but the middle seemed to sag. I still feel that the middle two quarters of the film do not have enough plot to carry their length, but that scarcely seems to matter in the face of the affection I feel for this movie.<br /><br />This is the only film in which John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd had the chance to play friends and allies.  They don't interact at all in \\"1941\\"; in \\"Neighbors\\" they play antagonists; and \\"Ghostbusters\\" and \\"Spies Like Us\\" were made too late for John to be in them. Their real-life friendship does not come across as clearly as in some of their SNL work due to the long shots in which they were often filmed, the sunglasses which restrict the expressive effectiveness of their acting, and the emotional reserve of their tough-guy characters.  But in the musical scenes that bond is readily apparent, and it becomes quite poignant to consider that one of these people will lose the other too soon, in both fiction (as revealed in the sequel, \\"Blues Brothers 2000\\") and reality.<br /><br />\\"The Blues Brothers\\" has held up better to an extremely high number of DVD viewings than some of my other favorite comedies. I think the reason for this is the extremely dry, restrained comedic tone of the film. (\\"Car's got a lot of pickup.\\") Some comedies are like fluffy chocolates that melt quickly in the mouth. \\"The Blues Brothers\\" is like a slightly sour hard candy that lasts a long, long time.<br /><br />Blu-Ray addendum, 11/12/2013: Appropriately enough, \\"The Blues Brothers\\" comes to Blu-Ray with excellent picture and sound quality. Whereas the DVD edition was a two-sided disc with the theatrical edition on one side and the extended edition on the other, the increased storage capacity of Blu-Ray allows both versions of the movie and the special features to appear on a single disc. Universal demonstrates a commendable attention to detail by adding a disclaimer to the extended edition pointing out that the added scenes come from a different source and may have different picture quality. (I actually noticed the difference even on DVD -- in general, the added scenes look more washed-out -- but Universal apparently felt the disclaimer was more necessary for Blu-Ray.)<br /><br />The movie's subtitles have been revised from the DVD edition. In the DVD era I always liked the fact that Universal's DVD subtitles, unlike those from some other studios, included all the song lyrics in the movies, but the new \\"Blues Brothers\\" subtitles only include lyrics sung on screen and not those of recordings played by the characters (e.g. \\"She Caught the Katy\\", \\"Soothe Me\\" and \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\"). Despite this slight disappointment, this is an excellent disc.
0393327345|5.0|A nice commentary on the twisted-yuppy-Ikea loving culture of today. Where people are so starved for attention that they attend these groups in hopes of filling a need for recognition.
B000002URV|4.0|I bought this because it's very relaxing to me. I really enjoy this cd.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I have never seen the band in person, but this DVD made me feel like I was there. Amazing sound and visuals. The huge glitter ball at the end of Comfortably Numb is hot...did Madonna borrow that for her Confessions Tour? LOL
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I am so excited that this movie is finally out on dvd!!!  I was worried that my VHS copy was going to die on me from being watched so many times.  Gregory Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov are both incredible dancers to watch and Isabella Rosellini is fantastic too!  Very much a Cold War themed movie, and it's interesting to see how two men can have the same feelings about two very different countries.  Making it even more dramatic is how true to life the situation must have been for Baryshnikov to play.  It's a combination dance/adventure/drama movie...and yes that is possible!  Something for everyone! I highly recommend it
B0007VCZ50|5.0|I was ecstatic when I heard this was coming to DVD. I remember attending a screening of this film when it came out in the mid-80's. I have always loved this movie. Sting is an incredible person; charming, funny, extremely talented. His persona as being the \\"deep\\", \\"tortured\\", arrogant rock star is so far from the truth. Having met and conversed with him a few times, I can say he is truly the reverse. He's kind and attentive. This film shows some of that certainly. And of course, for his first post-Police venture, the music and live performances are what you would expect from a man like Sting: incredible.
0440241588|3.0|JG is just a plain old good storyteller.  I felt he went on a vacation to  Brail when he wrote The Testament and that he needed to write everything off and make it a business trip too.<br /><br />I felt the same way reading this book, he wanted to go to Italy so he decided to kill two birds with one stone.<br /><br />I never felt like I was really getting into a  character here, if you want good characters, one you really feel like you are getting to know as a person, read Turow.<br /><br />Anyway the story is over the top, a bit predictable and I never really felt like the character was in any real danger, even though he was being hunted by the worlds best killers.  The romance was almost dull.<br /><br />All that said, the story is strong enough to be interesting and I keep at it till the end.  It was entertaining.<br /><br />My hope in future stories is that Grisham would try and write with the feeling and insight he did in the novel The Painted House, while that one isn't The Grapes of Wrath or anything, it was a compelling tale of a boy that put the reader into his world.  There is no reason that same energy couldn't be put into a story about a lawyer of some sort.<br /><br />I find it amazing that of all the novels he has written since; A Time to Kill is still the best.
B000EGDC14|4.0|I was just recently turned on to this band by a friend. I lose myself in another dimension with the sparse arrangements and catchy lyrics. I had heard that Madonna was listening to this band while recording her Confessions disc, and the influence is obvious. Good stuff.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|\\"Modern Times\\" is a very pleasant, mellow, and enjoyable set of 10 songs. His songwriting and singing are spirited and accessible, and his back-up band sound very comfortable with the materials and arrangements. Critics and reviewers can argue until the cows come home whether this is one of his greatest albums or not, though certainly it will stand the test of time as well as previous efforts such as \\"New Morning\\" or \\"Planet Waves.\\" Initially I bought the regular CD edition but came across this delux version, which looks great. So i'm buying it again, and will give the extra CD to an amigo. Dylan's worth it.
B000002KAT|5.0|If you're wondering why Astral Weeks is widely considered one of the greatest albums ever, chances are you've never heard it. Astral Weeks sounds even less like anything like it than those other \\"sounds-nothing-like-anything-like-it\\" records. It's not even a thing like a traditional soul or folk album - in fact, more often than not it sounds like a Medieval record. But Van gets a LOT of mileage out of the harpsichord/strings/flute/acoustic guitar arrangements, as well as his Bellfast reminiscening.<br />The meat of Astral Weeks lies in tracks three through six. First off is the brilliant love song Sweet Thing. Van's lyrics are excellent, and the swooping strings and flute add another layer. Next off is the harpsichord-happy Cypress Avenue, a coming-of-age story about a boy from the wrong side of the tracks in love with a rich girl. Third, The Way Young Lovers Do starts off sounding like a Celtic folk song, until the soul-influenced horn part enters. And, of course, we have the ten-minute character sketch Madame George, which may or may not be about a transvestite. But that doesn't matter, because it's pure poetry.<br />But that's not all that's good about the album - the title track, in spite of meandering slightly, is an excellent meditation on death. Beside You is an underrated song, and Slim Slow Slider has a great soprano sax part near the end. Even the semi-filler Ballerina, which wanders for seven minutes without saying much, has a great arrangement.<br />This was Van before he polished his sound. Even its follow-up, Moondance, is much more of a pop effort than Astral Weeks. Don't get me wrong, I like Moondance, but it's missing something. Astral Weeks, on the other hand, has that something: a layer of mystique that nearly forty years have not diminished.
0670034711|5.0|This is an extremely entertaining, fun and thought provoking read. I have given 3-4 copies as gifts to women friends in the last six months, not to mention my mother and sisters. The themes are universal, the stories are personal and easy to relate to. I look forward to her next book!
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Why in all the Star Wars Universe can I not have the original Star Wars Trilogy.  You know 1977, \\"Star Wars\\", 1980 \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", and 1983 \\"Return Of The Jedi\\".  Not the \\"kookie\\" cartoon versions, but the real thing.<br /><br />I recieved the so called updated versions as a gift and I was beyond disappointed.  They remain on my shelf only viewed once, and looked upon with disdain over how three very good movies were so butchered.<br /><br />With the number of fans begging for the \\"Real Thing\\", it would seem no one was indeed listening.  So I will say this one more time \\"May we please have the original version only in a Trilogy, not spread out the way they are now being marketed\\".<br /><br />I guess in a few years we will see the genuine article when someone needs more cash.  Shame on you George.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|The word on the e-street that this is the third in a trilogy with Time Out of Mind and Love and Theft is misleading. The only thing all three have in common is excellence. Time Out of Mind was a stark, brooding record, whereas the latest two have a playful, rollicking and nostalgic quality that better characterizes the current phase in Dylan's career. Time Out of Mind was the poetic capstone to a dark period; Love and Theft represented a rebirth that now finds its mature stride in Modern Times.
B000055XMF|4.0|What a movie...like it or not this movie tells it how it was in the 60's in England. The clashes of police with mods and rockers, scooters versus motorbikes and the effects of alcohol and sex in finding oneself. The music of The Who brings it altogether. Buy it...you will feel yourself singing 'My Generation' for days after...Enjoy!
B00005AQE8|3.0|The Production was good. Much Respect their. Lyrically though? LOL!!! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE read the haters who gave this like 1 or 2 stars. These cats actually like REAL MC's. They're just fustrated much like I am that people call this a CLASSIC. It sold millions and continues to do so. Big ups and so do these rappers now-a-days who have no skills. That doesn't mean it should be mentioned with the greats. Seriously PAC wasn't a THUG that was all a gimmic. Do your homework!!! He was from NEW YORK! HE HIMSELF LOVED HIP HOP REAL HIP HOP! If you are a PAC fan LISTEN TO REPRESENTIN 93. LISTEN to Old school. Any of his earlier material. You will see for yourself. This is just as good as the garbage floodin the market today. If you like what is coming out now, chances are you consider this a classic. LOL!!! Oh Yeah.... Jackson I appreciate all your remarks/coments. You must know what you're talkin about since all you do is bag on reviewers reviews. For all that want to read JACKSON'S reviews go check out 50 cent, Snoop, NWA, & of course Pac.
1878424319|5.0|It was a great help with certain people at work. I plan on buying it for them, in hopes it will help others.
B0009F2C34|5.0|I recommend this for Turntablists and up and coming DJ's. It never gets old and has an unforgetable, unique sound. I have the original copy with just the one disc, but I am sure that the second disc doesn't dissapoint. He is one of the illest! Peace
B000929AJQ|5.0|Let me get this straight: I love NIN, but this is the first CD I've gotten by them. Almost all the songs I've heard from them are great, but I'm not an avid fan. I heard that Nine Inch Nails were coming out with a new album, so I listened to the first single, \\"The Hand That Feeds.\\" Loved it. The song is bass-driven, which, speaking as a bassist myself, is awesome. Plus, Dave Grohl drums on that song, adding to the fantastic-ness of it. Later, I heard the next single, \\"Only,\\" great song, but not as good as \\"The Hand That Feeds.\\" I finally decided to get the album after that. <br /> <br />When listening to the album, I started loving their bassist more and more. I recently got the \\"All that Could Have Been: Live\\" VHS, and I was surprised: no bass player. I like the older songs more, but I prefer a bass player. Back to the album, most of the songs are bass-driven, or have a prominent bass line. <br /> <br />This album will disappoint fans who love their harder songs, although it has a few. The album is more melodic songs, with Trent screaming sometimes. On a side note, all of the instruments are superb, but especially the drums. <br /> <br />1. All The Love In The World: 10/10 It takes a while to speed up, but it's well worth the wait. My favorite song on the CD, by far. <br />2. You Know What You Are?: 8/10 The chorus is just about as hard as \\"March of the Pigs,\\" but isn't as good. <br />3. The Collector: 9/10 The drums are great in this song. Just wow. <br />4. The Hand That Feeds: 9.5/10 Another harder song that doesn't disappoint. <br />5. Love Is Not Enough: 8/10 This song kinda reminds me of Tool, but I don't think it's that great. <br />6. Every Day Is Exactly The Same: 8.5/10 Lyrics are good, but not much else. <br />7. With Teeth: 9.5/10 Wow. Awesome. The bass and the drums work so well together, plus the chorus is sweet. <br />8. Only: 9/10 It's amazing how long this song will be stuuck in your head. Not joking. <br />9. Getting Smaller: 9/10 Again, a hard, fast song. <br />10. Sunspots: 8.5/10 Doesn't work up to much, but when it gets there, it's good. <br />11. The Line Begins To Blur: 8/10 Great drums, but the rest of the song could've been better. <br />12. Beside You In Time: 9/10 Strange. All I can say, really. <br />13. Right Where It Belongs:  9.5/10 One hell of a track, one hell of a way to end the album.
B000G759LW|2.0|I'm not sure why this album needed 2 discs - and why if it did there is not actually two-disc's worth of material. <br /> <br />BACK TO BASICS contains 22 tracks (13 on disc one, 9 on disc two) consisting of 19 songs, 2 intros, and one 2-minute 21-second self-indulgent thinly-veiled lyrical middle-finger to her former collaborator and \\"Stripped\\" producer (\\"F.U.S.S.\\" - F**k U Scott Storch).  The extra-glossy booklet includes many retro-themed photos of Ms. Aguilera and song lyrics. <br /> <br />The first disc has 5 songs produced by DJ Premier.  The rest are produced by lesser-known (unknown) producers.  There are no collaborations with rappers; the only guest artist is Steve Winwood on \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" (where - as she far too often does - sings with a choir and channels a pre-divorce Mariah Carey).  The disc's final track, \\"Thank You (Dedication to the Fans...)\\", is a song, not an interlude or outro, but it does have \\"shout-out\\" messages from fans to Christina Aguilera mixed thru-out the track.  There are ballads, mid-tempo and up-tempo songs.   <br /> <br />The second disc is another mix of ballads, mid-tempo, and up-tempo tracks.  All nine songs are produced by Linda Perry.  Many of them do have a 20s/30s/40s/50s vibe.  This, the \\"Enhanced CD\\" disc, also contains the \\"bonus video\\" of \\"Back to Basics\\".  It is not accessible to all computers, including mine.  I have surmised that it is a \\"making of the album\\" documentary.   <br />
B000B8TOH6|3.0|I bought this at Strawberries Records for $28.00.  I bought it mainly for CD 2 of \\"rarities & B-sides\\".  It contains some great songs but there are 4 songs that are not rare at all.  In fact, 3 of these songs are from their biggest selling album so to say they are rare is crazy.  \\"Wild in the Streets\\", \\"Diamond Ring\\", \\"Let it Rock\\" and \\"Raise Your Hands\\" are all studio versions found on the original releases.  Why not put some more live songs for us?!  CD 1 is the same as the one released in 1994 except \\"Prayer 94\\" is replaced by \\"In These Arms\\" and \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" is added making 15 tracks.  Adding \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" makes total sense to me but I miss \\"Prayer 94\\", I thought it was a great version.  Lastly, the DVD from Wembley seems a bit week, the sound is muddy (on my system anyway) and you have to really turn up the volume.  I don't have the original release so I don't know if it's the same.  Overall for the price I paid, I think it's good but improving on the above mentioned would have made it great.
B00002R0MC|5.0|It's not much I can say because this box set will NOT disappoint!  From beginning to end, it captures your ears!  With a 95-page booklet which includes insight into Bob's life, song origins and wonderful photos, whether you are a huge fan or a beginning fan, you will not get enough of each of the tracks!  The 12\\" mixes of JAMMIN', EXODUS, RIDE NATTY RIDE, COMING IN FROM THE COLD, COULD YOU BE LOVED, and ONE LOVE/PEOPLE GET READY are the highlights for me as well as the first disc, which includes early mixes of ONE LOVE/PEOPLE GET READY, MELLOW MOOD, STIR IT UP, & THANK YOU LORD!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|This indeed appears to be the third and last album of a cycle that began with Time Out Of Mind and \\"Love And Theft\\". Anyone whose seen the live act lately knows how good the music has been during this current incarnation of Bob Dylan as the lead singer of a cowboy band.  <br />     Modern Times gives the cycle's preceeding albums more lyrical context, most strikingly with aspects of his personal life. With a jester's mask in hands as skillfull as Dylan's, any such statement is quite perilous you understand. Kind of like saying Blood On The Tracks is about, and only about, his divorce from Sara. There is, however, an overt linkage of thematic imagery and symbolism regarding the artist's relationship with his muse found in previous work. Here I'm refering to the muse as psychic phenomena and not any person or people. <br />     Dylan song's are usually so textured and layered, at times positively cryptic, that analysis tends to lead the critic wherever he wants to go. Even so, in several of the new tracks there remains an intriguing relationship between the symbols of woman and rain and the way they may be considered on the Blonde On Blonde album, assuredly a zenithal candidate and arguably the peak of his career as a performer. Some people in New York and England booed and the Rolling Thunder Revue is also very important, but few, I think, would argue that the Hawks-backed tours and the earlier three-album cycle or period beginning with Bringing it All Back Home and the famous Newport show with Bloomfield, Highway 61 Revisited, and culminating in Blonde On Blonde, didn't revolve around an artist at the height of his powers.  <br />     In a fairly recent interview with Ed Bradley on 60 minutes, Dylan seemed to confess as much. He recited the opening lines of Its Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding- Darkness at the break of noon/Shadows even the silver spoon/The handmade blade, the child's balloon/Eclipses both the sun and moon- and then said to Bradley, \\"I mean, how do you write something like that?\\" If Dylan indeed sees this as the high-water mark, then pursuing the muse-symbology in Modern Times becomes an exercise of added importance in studying the entire body of work. <br />     In Visions of Johana, for example, the woman Louise \\"holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to deny it.\\" She and her \\"lover\\", presumably the speaker, lie \\"entwined\\" together \\"stranded\\" in a room though they don't want to admit this (\\"though we all do our best to deny it\\").  As \\"these visions of Johanna...conquer (the speaker's) mind.\\" Louise, who \\"seems like the mirror\\", too is absorbed by the visions which have \\"now taken my (spkr) place.\\" Moreover, Louise has assured him \\"that Johanna's not here.\\" In the end only her visions remained. Either these are visions of Johanna herself, or, more likely, these are her visions; she had them, she made them, she brought them to the speaker and Louise, who may herself be a part of the speaker, maybe the part that tempts him. The images in the song, the ladies' game of blindman's bluff in the empty lot, the allnight girl's, the nightwatchman, Mona Lisa, the peddler and fiddler, all that which make up the song, make it such a good and original song, all of these ideas and creative flourishes are attributed by the speaker to Johanna. Thus the woman Johanna, is the muse herself or, more accurately I think, the muse's conduit.  <br />     The speaker in Nettie Moore, a track from Modern Times, tells the listener about one \\"Lost John\\", perplexed as he feels \\"...somethins out of whack/Blues is fallin' down like hail/Gonna leave a greasy trail\\", spurring Lost John, himself a singer \\"in a cowboy band\\" to perform this blues (\\"I'm gonna travel the world, that's what I'm gonna do\\"), this material that came to him in the hailstorm. The hail doesn't appear to be merely a frozen form of the \\"rain\\" that Louise tempts the VOJ speaker, it's something different, as Lost John tells us, although \\"the rain is gone, the river's on the rise.\\"  <br />    The sense here is that what usually motivates Lost John, the \\"She\\" of the song, ostensibly the Nettie Moore of the title, didn't do it this time. Lost John decides he will tour the world with this music and \\"then come back to you\\" after he's finished playing the blues that came in the hail. If \\"you\\" is Nettie Moore to Lost John and/or the speaker, than perhaps she is, like Johanna, a symbol of the conduit of Dylan's muse and, thus, the inspiration Dylan is using for the current album cycle and performaces is also differently-sourced from earlier in his career. This prior muse is dear to Dylan, but a blissful burden, a sacrifice of some kind is made if it is to be channeled- \\"A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day.\\" <br />     In any case, Modern Times is the latest in what will prove to be yet another period of importance in the life of a living, breathing, Major American Artist. Kind of in short supply these days. <br />      <br />
0689859414|5.0|I was not familiar with Holly Black's prose or Tony DiTerlizzi's artwork before purchasing this book. I am familiar with quality, however, and acting on a suggestion from a trusted source (a Nixie, if you must know), I got a copy of the FIELD GUIDE as a gift to some youngsters (who are also of the highest quality).<br /><br />Leafing through it (okay, poring), I experienced a sense of grief that I was giving the book away. It's that good. In fact, I'm idly contemplating getting a second volume of this FIELD GUIDE for myself, though it may look curious next to Brautigan's TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|It's not always easy pulling off a great 2 disc album, but RHCP did so at relative ease.It's not as hard or punk as the other albums, but it still is as good as the others. If you're a RHCP fan, than you def should buy this cd.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|If like myself, you heard all of the hoopla and jokes pointed at this movie, (not the least of which, was the line from Jack to Ennis, \\"I wish I knew how to quit you\\") avoiding seeing it might have seemed like a good decision.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is not the \\"Gay Cowboy\\" movie, but a devastatingly beautiful story about love between two men.  The intimate scenes are tastefully filmed and poignant.  For ranch hand Ennis Delmar, being gay is beyond his scope of understanding in 1963 Wyoming.  While he and the only slightly more aware, Jack Twist find themselves herding sheep together for a summer job in Wyoming, the truly unexpected happens.  They become friends and suddenly much more.  While both men go on to try and live the conventional married with children lifestyle with women, meeting up with each other again four years later only proves to each other that theirs, is the real love.  For nearly twenty years they meet a few times a year in the safe confines of Brokeback Mountain.  The marriages of both men deteriorate under the strain of an all consuming love that has to be kept a secret from the world, at least as far as Ennis is concerned.  The viewer is made painfully aware of the suffering due to separation and longing, of lifelong love and passion.  All of this is done with stellar performances by Ledger and Gyllenhall, who can say more with a look than any words might convey.  Ang Lee directs with a sensitive but no holds barred approach.  The cinematography is so good as to give this movie an epic feel.  The windy, Wyoming plains pound home the feelings of loneliness and desolation this movie evokes. The bottom line is, love is love.  One walks away from this movie profoundly moved.  An interesting little twist near the end shows Ennis viewing the contents of Jack's closet.  This is when love and heartbreak transcends any type of sexual orientation to become the language we all know and speak.  A must see movie, maybe twice!
0060899190|3.0|Love the website, but just thought the book was OK. Some of it began to annoy me. Bought \\"Found\\" at the same time, and it completely overshadowed PostSecret for me.
6304039506|5.0|Brutal Brando, I love Marlon Brando. but he was too mean in this movie. No heart or feelings for poor Blanche. Blanche was an outcast. The subject of her rejection was an indication of her being the way that she was. What Blanche did was by all means  wrong and it couldn't be excused. You could see the beauty in her despite her heavy burden. Blanche was too hard on herself. She was always wanting approval from others. Not knowing how graceful, refined, and beautiful she was. I agree she was a little frayed around the edges and she took refinement to another level. But still she showed signs of the proper up bringing and breeding. Blanche had fallen from grace.    The cast was outstanding. Wright King one of my favorite actors never quite made the grade in movies. Kim hunter made some progress on the screen. Kim's movie acting was limited to a certain degree. Perhaps these people were stage actors. Mitch who was to be Blache's savior was excellent as well. Karl Maulden was a fine actor.    They tell me John Garfield was up for the part of Stanley. I think Marlon Brando was the best choice. John Garfield could be rough. He had a tough guy attitude. But I don't believe he could be as brutal as Brando.    I could not handle the last part in the movie. It was hard to see Blanche reduced to what seemed like a fleeing animal. The way she ran and fell to the floor. The matron perhaps envious of this delicate women; wanted to put her in a straight jacket and have her nails cut. Poor Blache, but the doctor an older gentlemen understood Blanche's personality. He knew what would work for Blanche. She was a lady and well mannered at that. So he treated her like a lady. To see him tip his hat, take her arm  and escort her out to the waiting car was touching.    My favorite part in this movie was the first scene. The sight of the train making it's way to New Orleans. The cabs pulling up just in time to load pasengers. This reminded me of days gone by. Then out of the smokey steamcame Blanche.    This is a very sensitive movie. A study of the lost and lonely with no where to turn.
B000084T18|5.0|After 12 million sold and countless unrelased material including his Columbia \\"Power of a Dollar\\" this is almost a classic.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|JAWS (1975). Released by Universal. Widescreen. Rated \\"PG\\". Running Time: 2 hours, 03 mins.<br /> Directed by Steven Spielberg. Written by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb.<br />The first movie in the series.<br /><br />  This film must be seen in a movie theater.  It was made for the big screen.  On television, it looks quite tame.  The people of today just don't get it.<br />I saw this film twice in a theater and the last time I saw it then, I was sitting in the very front row because of a (now-former) friend demanded to see it up front.  I was so scared.  I was young.  I had nightmares and couldn't sleep. I had to sleep in the living room with the lights on.  Now that I'm around the same age as Roy Scheider in \\"JAWS\\", I can sit and watch this film every time I see it on.<br />  Tom (Jonathan Filley) and Chrissie (Susan Backlinie) just met each other at the beach campfire.  They decide to go for a moon light swim, skinny dipping.  Chrissie already has her clothes off as she runs to the water.  Tom is having a bit of trouble undressing because he is drunk.  Chrissie, naked, enjoys the  water, but suddenly something tries to pull her under and then violently moves her around.  She is terrified, screaming to God. Then she is pulled down to her death.  Tom has heard nothing.  He has passed out.<br /> Later, when a shark kills a boy (Jeffrey Voorhees) in the beach water, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) realizes he really has a problem on his hands.  With the help of Quint (Robert Shaw) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), Brody must find and destroy the biggest, most dangerous shark he has ever seen.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Lorraine Gray, Murray Hamilton, Jeffrey C. Kramer, Chris Rebello, Jay Mello, Lee Fierro, Fritzi Jane Courtney,Alfred White, Cyprian R. Dube, Dorothy Fielding, Beverly Powers.<br />  Writer Carl Gottlieb is \\"Meadows\\".<br />  Writer of the \\"JAWS\\" novel, Peter Benchley is an interviewer on the beach.<br /><br />Denise Cheshire also play \\"Chrissie\\" swimming.<br />Susan Backlinie would re-do her famous scene from JAWS, in the movie [[ASIN:B00TF7KY96 1941 [Blu-ray]]] (1979) but with a comedic twist.<br /><br />Robert Shaw died the next year, August 28, 1978 from a heart attack at the age of 51. he was born in Lancashire, England, United Kingdom.  See him in [[ASIN:B011MHCLJC From Russia With Love]] (1963).<br /><br />Look closely: After Richard Dreyfuss cuts open the shark, he pulls out a license plate with \\"007\\" on it.<br />  To return the favor, EON Productions and Pinewood Studios name the Richard Kiel's character, \\"Jaws\\" for The Spy Who Loved Me (1963) and Moonraker (1979).<br /><br />Amity is actually Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Sound.<br />  What this film started was a mass hysteria, if you will, of people afraid of going to the beach and being in the water.  Yes, tiger sharks can bite a chunk out of you.  Surfboards can look like a seal to eat to a shark.  Blood and meat attracts sharks too.<br /><br />In-film advertising: Coca-Cola and Old Spice.<br /><br />JAWS was nominated for Best Picture and won the Academy Award for Best Sound, Original Music Score--John Williams and Film Editing.<br /><br />The falling star you see in this film is a trademark of Spielberg's.  You can find it in other Spielberg films.<br /><br />The tv version, edited down, has a longer running time of 2 hours, 10 minutes.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|Outstanding! Well worth the wait. <br /> <br />I have been a major motor racing fan since the mid-fifties (as a youngster, I attended the first US Grand Prix, Sebring 59, as well as several of the Sebring 24 hours where I got to meet Phil Hill). I saw the original movie, in Cinerama, multiple times, back when it first came out; it thrilled me every time and I practically memorized it.  <br /> <br />It was with much trepidation that I started watching the DVD, hoping to not be too disappointed. I needn't have worried; it met/exceeded my expectations of it and did justice to my memories of the original in theaters. <br /> <br />I can't wait until we complete a major refurbishing of our Condo's Recreation Building to see it again; it will include a media room with a 60 inch Hi-Def television and a Bose Lifestyle 48 surround sound system. In our apartment (because of sheer size/space constraints in our older entertainment wall unit) we only have a 32 inch Hi-Def LCD with a Bose Lifestyle 35; yet even at 32 inch, the movie was most impressive...and the sound was awesome. <br /> <br />Sergei Kowalchik <br />Key Biscayne, FL <br />
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Great media. The actors performed their parts well. However, <br />of all the comments that I have seen no one has mentioned that once again native American history is ignored. At least one reference to \\"Ira Hayes\\" or other songs from the Bitter Tears album would have been appropriate.
0679882820|4.0|This was for my daughter who is 11 months old. I liked it because it is a board book and she cant rip the pages.
0792839730|2.0|This movie, which I viewed 25 years ago, does not age well. While the tension between the generals is effectively portrayed, there are too many hokey elements to the actual sets. Perhaps I am wrong and some European reader could correct me, but I find it hard, in the middle of the war, with prior bombing raids, to believe that the streets of the Holland town were immaculately clean. There is too much waiting around in this movie and not enough actual portrayal of action. Too many of the officers trapped in the town escape for me to regard the movie as realistic. And would a British general have gone that far forward--I know the real Sean Connery would have but a real British general?????????
B000FZETIO|3.0|Just like another reviewer, I too was VERY disappointed in the much-hyped original ending of Pretty in Pink. I was among those who felt that Andie should have ended up with Duckie, so I was eagerly awaiting the chance to finally see it happen. Well, the last 20 years were spent waiting in vain! Although the original Andie/Duckie ending was shown in theaters (and rejected by test audiences), it was not reproduced for this DVD. All we see is the cast talking about the ending and why \\"it just didn't work.\\" How about letting the fans see it and decide for themselves? As for the \\"Volcanic Ensembles\\" extra that talks about Andie's and Duckie's costumes, it would have been worth mentioning why Andrew McCarthy's character wears the same white pants and blue shirt throughout the whole film! <br /> <br />While I love this movie, the \\"Everything's Duckie Edition\\" was really a letdown, which is why I am only giving it three stars. About the only worthwhile part of the so-called original ending is Andrew McCarthy's explanation as to why Blane's hair (which was so impeccable throughout the movie) looks like an overgrown mushroom during the prom scene. Maybe the last 20 years haven't been spent waiting in vain, after all ....
B000FIMG68|4.0|I downloaded te show from iTunes. So I know  nothing about the extra features. <br />~IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT PROCEED READING AT YOUR OWN RISK~ <br />Although, when Michael shot those two women, I no longer cared if he got his son back, & no longer cared about what happened to his character...(hint, hint, writers & producers of the show). I'm sure the choice was probably made to kill them off because they were expensive character actresses, but DAMN, what a shameful waste!  <br />On a more positive note, Evangeline Lilly plays up the damsel in distress role quite charmingly.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Play it safe and buy the OT on VHS...  That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard! <br /> <br />If you don't want to buy these because of the PQ, fine but if you do?  Don't waist your money on VHS tapes!!!  These new DVD's may not have the greatest quality but at the very least, they will be equal to the \\"Laser Discs\\" which is better than VHS any day of the week!   <br /> <br />Besides, VHS is a dead format, they won't keep making VCR's for much longer...  What will you do with your OT on VHS when there are no more players?  At least on DVD, you will be able to watch them for years to come...  And the quality won't be any worse than VHS.  In fact, it will be better!

B00004YYDI|5.0|I originally seen this when it first came out on video but it was the \\"American version\\" still was entertaining but it had some holes in it.Just around a year or 2 ago I bought this version and it s much better.If you enjoy movies that have action but also show some depth, this is the movie.Also every character is perfect, Gary Oldman is the highlight as a completely out of control DEA cop who doesn't listen to anyone.Danny Aiello is good too, playing a \\"Italian restaurant owner/ bank\\" .Other than that please just see it, then buy it.
0743243315|5.0|What a magnificent study of a repressed woman realizing the power of her own singular identity!  <br /> <br />\\"Brick Lane\\" is a novel that gives abundant rewards to the PATIENT reader.  It seems that almost every reader review that dismisses this novel as BORING has stopped reading at 100 pages. But this novel gains incredible momentum as it goes along, Monica Ali's structure is so clearly one of a building intensity, that to dismiss it after only reading a third of the novel is a shame.   <br />  <br />The heroine of \\"Brick Lane\\", the newly betrothed Bangladeshi wife Nazneen, begins this story as a fundamentaly simple Muslim woman -- but the gradual development of her awareness and commitment to her limited world as an immigrant in London provides a deeply involving character study, and it is presented in a context that is so immediate to the state of the world today.   <br /> <br />The story is deceptively slow in the beginning, but any perceptive reader will understand that the claustrophobic and mundane treatment of the life of Nazneen is a true depiction of her life, as a devout Muslim immigrant in London.  <br /> <br /> Ali's steady and perceptive development of Nazneem's experience is a fascinating window into the very real identities of these immigrants, and the gradually unfolding emotions of that experience will come to bear on Nazneen's life in a way that makes her a much richer character than could have been expected.  Her journey has been richly imagined by Monica Ali, and her story only becomes more exciting as the novel progresses.   <br /> <br />This is a novel that truly BUILDS to its conclusion, a closure to Nazneen's story that is so wonderfully satisfying.  Monica Ali is able to deliver a profound conclusion to her story of Nazneen, because she has carefully controlled the detailed journey that brings the immigrant bride to a place of un-hoped for independence and strength.  <br /> <br />And along the way, Monica Ali creates secondary charactersthat are a as much a part of the social fabric of Immigrant London as the central character of Nazneen.  It is a cliche to say that a novel set in London is Dickensian, but the friends and family of Nazneen are presented in a way that only hints at the depth of their humanity, each could be the subject of their own novel.   <br /> <br />That a novel presenting a simple character such as Nazneen could grow into a complex story that is so rewarding to the reader, surely speaks to the artistry of Monical Ali, and she has written a profoundly moving story.  <br /> <br />Trust this novel to involve you, and you will be rewarded with an unforgettable experience.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000GLKLCK|5.0|This new remastered edition gives this the best sound quality ever for these classic recordings . A must have at a resonable price. <br />Enjoy!
B000F7CMRM|5.0|No one tries to penetrate the Mideast like Clooney and his director here. I've watched twice and will continue to watch until I 'get' it. But given the lousy movies made everywhere, I salute this cast for giving us real insight, or potentially real insight into this odd but real world. We know so little. I think this film derserved an academy award for ensemble casting and for opening a complex subject few undertand. George C. : I applaud you and all the others in the cast. Sorry you were injured but you went after a difficult and important story, here, and I THANK YOU. 5 stars
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is a very very impressive release. I think the top song here is Workingmans Blues #2 because its so haunting and honest. The musician ship is top notch. The songwriting is amazing with lyrics only Bob Dylan can bring. I dont think its his best release ever but its one of the top best. Probably 4th or 5th or something. (he has like 1000 albums) And for those of you who dont like this kind of music, just go back and listen to your \\"cool\\" Jessica Simpson crap and all that disgusting, brain dead, corporate noise. Because DYLAN LIVES. <br />
B00065GX64|5.0|what makes a man kill young children?    even he himself doesn't know!    we look with hatred at the killer when he lures young children. but when he's chased down and caught by a vengeful mob, his terror makes us pity him. even more his helplessness against his own perversion.    he knows that what he is doing is wrong. but he can't help it.    similar to drug addicts who can't help themselves from getting deeper into their addiction.    beautifully done movie which brings out the enigma of human nature. brilliant performance by the lead actor.
B00003OSSL|1.0|I thought this movie was a big disappointment. Harrison Ford plays a widow who finds out his wife was on a plane with her lover when they both die in the crash. He wants to know why his wife had an affair and how could she have lied to him and how long and how serious...blah, blah. All he did was whine the entire movie. Also, he plays a police officer and not a very good one. This movie lacked substance and character.
0792837614|5.0|It's a 60's remake of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Maria and Tony come from two different ethnic backgrounds, but what they do share is the love and passion they have for one other. However, their already fueding families would never accept such a union and blood will be shed.  <br />What I love about this movie is the dancing, it's perfect and flawless. The whole movie is like a dance. The natural flow of the movie is timeless.
B000005RTG|3.0|THE BAND: David Coverdale (vocals), Tommy Bolan (guitars), Jon Lord (keyboards, organ), Glenn Hughes (bass & vocals), Ian Paice (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1975) 9 songs (listed as 10 tracks on the disc) clocking in at just under 37 minutes. Included with the disc is a 4-page booklet containing assorted black & white band photos, song titles/credits, song lyrics, and thank you's. Recorded at Musicland Studios, Munich, West Germany. Originally released on Warner Bros' label, this digitally remastered edition re-released by Metal Blade.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I'll first say that \\"Come Taste The Band\\" is a decent album. There are a few great songs here in \\"Love Child\\", \\"You Keep On Moving\\", \\"Drifter\\" and the instrumental \\"Ode To G\\". The rest of the album has kind of a bluesy-funky-groovy feel to it... as opposed to in your face rock & roll. The remaining 5 songs are decent, but simply not memorable. Coverdale was a good replacement singer for Ian Gillan, though his best albums with Deep Purple were easily behind him - \\"Burn\\" followed by \\"Stormbringer\\". Hughes was a decent replacement for Roger Glover on bass, but make no mistake, his lead vocals on \\"Getting' Tighter\\" and \\"This Time Around\\" are like fingernails running down a chalkboard for me... good backing vocals, but he is no lead singer. Tommy Bolin (Zephyr, James Gang, solo artist) is/was a decent guitarist... though his drug addiction took center stage as often as his guitar playing. Bolin is no Ritchie Blackmore... not even close (not in the this century or the next). Many of the songs feature Lord's keyboards and a heavy bass line... and Bolin's guitar is simply in the background... give the disc a few spins and you'll see. Accompanied with a replacement singer and bassist from two years prior, and a new stand-in guitarist... Deep Purple was a mere shell of its former self. Imagine Led Zeppelin without Page and Plant, the Rolling Stones without Richards and Jagger, or Aerosmith without Perry and Tyler and I bet you'd probably be thinking along the same lines. \\"Come Taste The Band\\" can stand on it's own, but there's simply no comparing it to other DP rock classics like \\"Machine Head\\", \\"Fireball\\", or \\"Burn\\"... or tier-2 releases like \\"In Rock\\", \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\" or \\"Perfect Strangers\\", etc. I can't help but also mention that the band split up after \\"Come Taste The Band\\" and didn't get back together (all original members) until 1984's aptly titled \\"Perfect Strangers\\". Some good tunes here, but overall just a satisfactory album (3.5 stars).ou'd probably be thinking along the same lines. \\"Come Taste The Band\\" can stand on it's own, but there's simply no comparing it to other DP rock classics like \\"Machine Head\\", \\"Fireball\\", or \\"Burn\\"... or tier-2 releases like \\"In Rock\\", \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\" or \\"Perfect Strangers\\", etc. I can't help but also mention that the band split up after \\"Come Taste The Band\\" and didn't get back together (all original members) until 1984's aptly titled \\"Perfect Strangers\\".

6304117752|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest musicals ever. It's about a nun named Maria, who is sent away from a convent to find out the will of God for her life. She is sent to be a governess to a captain with seven children, and she brings joy and laughter in the house, where there was coldness and harshness and in the process she steals a man's heart and falls in love. This movie will take you through the journey of Maria's personal life as a nun and her new life as a part of the captain's family, all the while, with an incredible blend and sound of music.
0618001905|5.0|Adam Hochschild has written a spellbinding account of Belgian's King Leopold and his late-19th/early-20th century reign of terror in Africa's Congo. 16th and 17th America may have had in place the most visible system of slavery, if only because of its size and power, but \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" is a sobering rejoinder that almost all of the major European countries have played a sickening role in the devastation of Africa and its people.  Hochschild skillfully weaves the story of Leopold's plunder of the region's natural resources (chiefly, rubber)-- which facilitated the grisly exploitation of the natives, including mutilation and forced labor--with that of human rights advocates like Belgian-born E.D. Morel, a shipping clerk-turned-investigative journalist who almost singlehandedly mounted and sustained a worldwide campaign to end the wanton slaughter of millions of Congolese.  The sheer monstrosity of this holocaust--which brought Leopold untold riches and vastly expanded his world influence--coupled with the king's megalomania, his abominable duplicity and utter lack of morality, firmly places Leopold among the ranks of Stalin and Hitler!   <br /> <br />At the same time, Hochschild does not shy away from African complicity in its own devastation.  He writes of Africa's centuries-old practice of slavery, which has obviously proven quite perilous for the continent.  Hochschild describes a system of plunder by European-sanctioned African chiefs and despots, who gleefully enriched themselves while continuing the system of Leopold-inspired repression and brutality.  Indeed, Hochschild makes clear that these factors are among the most powerful culprits for the many social, economic and political problems that continually plague Africa to this day.  In short, this wonderful book makes for jaw-dropping--and ultimately dismaying--reading!

B000GIWS7E|4.0|OK, so when I saw the set-list I was actually excited (especially the thought of the complete 6DoIT). On my initial listen to the DVD though (admitting it was really a quick scan as I didn't have time to go all the way thru it) I found it to be rather boring. Part 2 is mostly slow, mellow stuff. I feel the Budakon DVD is much more energetic and exciting. As to LaBries' vocals, I find the guy to be mostly annoying (in fact I think the band does nicely without him) but he actually has moments on the DVD where I LIKE his singing. In general the performance by the band is not as good as Budakon. But I admit, the 2nd more thorough listen was better. So I say- buy the DVD if you like DT. Don't have high expectations and you won't be disappointed. But for 14 bucks- its worth it. If you don't have Budakon- start there instead.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is an amazing collection of covers by a man at a minute to the midnight of his life, and is just heartbreakingly beautiful. It's like he understands exactly where he's been, and where he's going, and he's made peace with that journey. Listening to Johnny Cash, you get the feeling that he understands every bit of pain you're experiencing - he's like an older brother who you can go to when you've been dumped by your girlfriend, and he'll tell you everything's going to be all right, even though she did go off with another bloke, after telling you she loved you so many times. But it's fine. Johnny Cash has been my older brother these past few days. I'm glad he's there for me. He's someone I can actually trust. His advice had kept me going. God bless you, Johnny.

B000AV2G3I|5.0|John Lennon was the first musician in modern times to have a keen understanding of his own iconic status and he used it to build an international political community for world peace. Even those who have political differences will Lennon, agree that his intellect, political savvy had tremendous impact on an entire generation of young people. Lennon told us that the movement we need for international peace was on our shoulders and came up with the audacious idea that war is over, if we want it.<br /><br />Even in hindsight, I don't even think most of us who lived through Beatles era completely appreciate the impact that John Lennon had on their own lives. Richard Nixon understood Lennon's impact on the peace movement. Nixon lived in fear of Lennon and fought a long battle in court to have him deported as an undesirable alien.<br /><br />After the breakup of the Beatles, Paul, and Ringo retreated into the cocoon of domestic bliss and the bland irrelevance of by-the-numbers rock stardom. George became a devotee of Krishna Consciousness and had a fleeting moment of social consciousness when he put together two benefit concerts for the refugees of war torn Bangladesh in 1971.<br /><br />John was the keeper of the flame and the unapologetic activist, and despite all of his personal flaws John was indeed the \\"brilliant Beatle.\\"<br /><br /> The two CD, 38 song anthology, \\"Working Class Hero\\" demonstrates how profoundly relevant Lennon's music remains to our own lives in 2006, three decades after his death.<br /><br />John was the visionary and the dreamer, even as he told us that \\"the dream was over.\\" John's music embraced existential ambiguity and contradiction. Lennon's exploration of the human condition was uncharted  territory for a pop musician to explore the \\"boggie down\\" climate of the American music business in the early Seventies. Not even Dylan was writting songs that were as emotionally resonant and flat-out honest as John's \\"Mother\\", \\"Imagine\\", or \\"God.\\"<br /><br />No other musician has significantly changed the lives of those who heard his message, as John Lennon has.  John's message was simple: no matter how long you live, or how dire the world appears to be, never give up on your dreams. To his critics who called him naieve John said, \\"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.\\" John was right. Without our dreams we might as well be dead.<br /><br />\\"Working Class Hero\\" is sole anthology of Lennon's work that defines Lennon the artist, the man, the philosopher and charismatic leader of a movement for world peace. Lennon's magnificent story is embedded in the content of the 38 songs in \\"Working Class Hero.\\"<br /><br />Pay no attention to the naysayers who have various hairs-splitting complaints about \\"Working Class Hero.\\" One reviewer complains the album has been \\"remixed\\" but it's a specious claim because the pristine digital sound quality is actually far better than the early 1970s state of the art studio mixes. The biggest improvements are on the Phil Specter produced tracks in which Mr. Specter, for the first time in his career, seemed oddly disengaged from the artist he was producing.<br /><br />As far selection of the 38 songs that comprise this anthology, they couldn't be better. If there was an important song from Lennon's legacy left out of this collection, nobody has pointed it out to me. These are the exact songs I would select if I were burning my own CD of John Lennon's songs. All previous Lennon collections have significant omissions of some of John's best songs. This anthology does justice to the complete trajectory of John Lennon's solo career from \\"Live Peace in Toronto 1969\\" to \\"Live in New York City\\" his posthumous live release in 1986. There isn't a single song that is filler here.<br /><br />The presentation of the songs isn't in any rigid chronological order but there is a pattern of presenting the songs in reverse chronology. It benins with \\"Starting Over\\" in a journey backwards in time end up with John's earliest Plastic Ono Band recordings, like \\"Cold Turkey\\" and \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". The reason why some songs are presented out of order is, perhaps, an effort to equitably distribute Lennon's best music over the run length of both CDs.<br /><br />If you are a causal fan of John Lennon's the only other way you'll get a more complete profile of John's career is to purchase the 4 CD box set \\"Anthology\\" (1998) which is grossly overpriced at $67.49. \\"Anthology\\" is more complete but not better than \\"Working Class Hero\\", because \\"Anthology degrades the quality of selections by including outtakes, alternative takes, studio chatter, home recording sessions and rarities that weren't good enough to be included in any of John's catalog of releases.<br /><br />By contrast, \\"Working Class Hero\\" is Lennon's top-shelf material and you don't have to suffer through the 2 hours of filler cuts to harvest the bounty of these essential 38 songs that defined Lennon as an artist. The price of \\"Working Class Hero\\" is $22.99, which is a steal by comparisonand \\"Give Peace a Chance\\".

B00006J9OT|5.0|I should start this review by saying that I am not a jazz fan.  I like a little bit every now and then, but I could never build a huge jazz collection.  I listen to rock and other popular music-- everything from the Beatles to the Clash to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Tori Amos.  However, I came across this Diana Krall CD when I became interested in jazz music thanks to Joni Mitchell.  Joni's albums of the '70s are heavily influenced by jazz.  I loved them all, so I began looking for other female vocal jazz performers.  It was in this way that I stumbled upon Diana Krall's \\"Live in Paris.\\" <br /> <br />I love this album.  For a long time, I only listened to it occasionally and as background music (as other reviewers have described it.)  However, one evening I sat down to really listen to the album and discovered that it is a veritable treasure trove of excellent music.  I was captured by Diana's unique vocal style.  It was beautiful, plaintive and very different from many other female vocalists I have come across.  Her band was absolutely wonderful--full of energy during songs like \\"I Love Being Here with You\\" and slinking with sexuality and grit during songs like \\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\"  I'm not typically a fan of \\"standards\\" such as these, but this album has enchanted me.  I listen to it often in a wide variety of moods.  It has become something of a security blanket for me.  I encourage everyone, from jazz purists to rock fans like myself, to pick up a copy and listen to it as MUSIC and not as background noise.  You will not be disappointed.
B000AADYRQ|1.0|Ah, Death Cab For Cutie.  These dream weavers conjure up images of summer breezes, spending time one on one with the one that you love while you sip pina coladas, telling her that she's still the one, and that she's all (you) need - not only that, but she's the inspiration.  Whether she's smooth like honey or a sister with golden hair, whether her name is Shannon, Mandy or Sara, it doesn't matter.  It's obvious you can't fight this feeling anymore - you'd really love to see her tonight, and she's waiting for you with open arms.  You wanna know what love is, and you want her to show you. <br /> <br />Do these images take you anywhere else?  Maybe you are thinking of your significant other?  Perhaps.  But there's something else that I am reminded of, and it just isn't coming to me... <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />Oh, yes.  FM Radio circa 1981.  The airwaves were dominated by the sounds of sensitive, sentimental soft rock.  Apparently, it was a time that Ben Gibbard remembers fondly, as that influence is stamped all over Death Cab For Cutie's latest album (and major label debut), Plans. <br /> <br />Make no mistake about it - soft rock circa 2006 isn't very different from what you might have heard in 1981.  Perhaps the percussive elements lends a modern air to it, but the little synth sound that kicks in just before Gibbard starts singing on \\"Soul Meets Body\\" informs you - we might as well talk about how great these newfangled VCRs are since we were able to tape \\"One Day At A Time\\" while we were out. <br /> <br />As is the case with all late '70s / early '80s soft rock, the music is never too distracting, and the vocalist is always front and center - so you know that this is clearly Gibbard's show.  What, if anything, have we learned from Plans?  Gibbard LOVES you.  That's right, YOU - the person I'm pointing at right now.  And you, too.  And you three.  What can I say - Gibbard is a man of love.  I could say that he wears his heart on his sleeve, but obviously that would be an understatement. <br /> <br />The whole album is basically one long paean to love.  Songs like \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" need no explanation, as Gibbard pledges his eternal devotion to YOU.  The songs are all so sweet that listening to them gave me a mouth full of cavities - and I'm hitting you with the dental bill, Mr. Gibbard!  It's perfect music for falling asleep to, especially with someone next to you to help you feel all warm and cozy.  Heck, I'm feeling warm just typing this ... or maybe it's just the humidity. <br /> <br />Death Cab For Cutie are the house band on teenybopper soap opera The OC, and have put love in many teenage hearts.  Fans of the show have become Death Cab For Cutie fans, and they long for Ben Gibbard like he longs for them.  Love, Love, LOVE ... I'M ON A LOVE BUZZ RIGHT NOW!!! <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />Now I've come down.  Uh ... where am I?  Um ... love?  Love?  Soft rock?  Major label?  The OC?  Death Cab For Cutie?  See where this is leading?  Corporate pop schlockmeisters, that's what these guys are! <br /> <br />In summary: Death Cab For Cutie proudly carries the soft rock torch into the 21st Century with Plans.  But is that something to be proud of?  Only if selling albums and making money is more important to you than artistic integrity and creativity.  Plans is doing the former but completely lacks the latter.  The only people I can recommend this to are female teenage MTV fanatics who think The OC is \\"like, totally the best show in, like, forever!\\".  Everyone else: Pass on it.
B000001EUN|3.0|A very interesting album from the Scorps. . .The cover was polarizing enough, stretching the boundaries of 1980's good taste with its' exotic, animalistic, sexually provocative imagery, not to mention the bizarre inner sleeve photo(for those of you who have an original LP pressing).     Although song lyrics and structure clearly suggests the Scorps are trying to ascend the same sexually charged thematic heights reached on Lovedrive, this album in comparison tends to fall short.    My major complaint about this album has always been the production. Klaus Meine's vocals seem tinny and buried in each song. Perhaps Meine was already experiencing some major problems with his voice with the final mix adjusted to compensate for it? \\"Make it Real\\" has lead guitar buried at the center of the mix. Whose idea was that? It seems only to achieved giving the mix a mushy quality, which can also be said of the bass sound in many songs.     Secondly, a certain little brother's writing, and specifically solo work, are missing here and leave a demonstrable void when compared to \\"Lovedrive\\". It is interesting to consider what might have been were Michael still on board as writing is so similar on each album.    Despite these problems, the album does manage to come to its' feet and put up a good fight. Tunes such as \\"Don't Make No Promises your Body Can't Keep\\", (a rare writing credit to Matthias Jabs), \\"The Zoo\\", \\"make it Real\\" and \\"Only a Man\\" keep the swaggering sexuality moving forward. Then there is my personal favorite, \\"Falling in Love\\", whose simple guitar line understates a very straightforward theme every young rocker can relate to: lust. It's another example of the Scorp's ability to meld clever lyrics with a sharp rhythmic hook at just the right moment.     The Scorps toyed with themes of misogyny/objectification of women in their lyrics, and pointedly displayed them in their album artwork. I think this album is arguably the zenith of that sexual energy, and despite some obvious production flaws, shows this band in a very interesting period of their career: standing on their own in the lineup that would lead to world wide fame. Highly Recommended despite my technical criticisms. 3.5 stars.
B0000025ZF|5.0|Awesome album!! For those of you who don't know too much about Pink Floyd, this is from the mastermind behind the \\"stories\\" of Floyd's songs. Roger wrote great lyrics while David supplied the awesome guitar riffs. This solo album of Waters is a must have of any Pink Floyd fan. I strongly recommend it!
B00005MKA3|5.0|I would rank Bob Marley's best albums as Exodus, Rastaman Vibration and this one, Survival. Exodus includes in number the most well known songs, whereas Rastaman Vibration and Survival contain some of his best lesser known songs. Survival is popularly known as his most \\"politically charged\\" album. This is probably a fair appraisal. I believe it was released in 1979 when he was at his peak in my opinion. The song Survival is probably my favorite track on the album, and probably my favorite Bob Marley track overall.
0767811070|5.0|Boyz n the Hood was one of the most important movies of the 1990's. It is both an excellent movie about life in the mean streets of the inner city as well as a reinforcer of the moral values needed to turn around the situation in Urban America where youth gangs run rampant. During the course of the story, it offers much needed commentary on the <br />situation that young people find themselves in and how they can get out of it. <br /> <br />At the start of the movie there is a subtitle that says \\"One out of every 21 black males will be murdered in his lifetime, most will be killed at the hands of another black male.\\" If anything, that fact is even worse today. Most flicks today that are about the inner city crime scene have taken many of their concepts from this film, but many of these <br />films today are all shoot `em up movies that have no morality, strong plot or serious social message. <br /> <br />The setting of this flick is South Central L.A.: Where murder rates are five times the nationwide average, or in absolute figures, double the entire U.S.'s death rate for breast cancer. Over the past two decades the Los Angeles Police Department has accumulated a backlog of 4,400 unsolved homicides - roughly 3/4ths of the city's total. <br /> <br />This gripping tale evolves around a single black father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), raising his one and only son, Tré Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and installing in him the values to help him become a man. This is an important point that director John Singleton took time to illustrate since the majority of men in the black community are often raised by their single mothers. The values that Furious Styles instills in Tre are generally not portrayed in most movies today. <br /> <br />Essentially, Boyz n the Hood is a movie about peace. Its message is that violence isn't the answer, and this movie shows the effects of violence being what residents of the inner city all too frequently resorts to when there are otheralternatives available.  <br /> <br />The movie starts when Tre's mother sends him <br />to live with his father Jason, a/k/a \\"Furious\\", who <br />is much better equipped to raise a son in a neighborhood like this. The movie quickly moves forward seven years when seventeen year old Tre and his best friend Ricky about to graduate from high school, while <br />another friend Doughboy has already graduated - from <br />shoplifting to guns and small-time drug deals. And while Furious guides Tre towards moral choices, responsibility and self-respect, Doughboy and Ricky are raised by a mother who lacks the capacity to instill proper values and morals in her offspring.  <br /> <br />The basic plot to Boyz n the Hood is can Tre avoid the crime and drug scene and live a normal, decent life? This is all the more challenging given all the crime and violence around him. Boyz n the Hoodis an excellent film that is a drama based on real human beings. It shows the <br />dire straits that folks in the South Central are in without being conscending or exploitative. Boyz n the Hood is a flick that is well written, acted and directed. The cinematography is stunning.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|The editing is cryptic to the point of making the film unwatchable. Every scene buries whatever pertinent, relevent piece of information it conveys in static. You'll still be waiting for the ultimate point of most scenes to be releaved when they end. After the 20th scene that seemed to have no relevence to any previous scene I pretty much stopped paying attention. Despite writing and direction being credited to Stephen Gaghan the film bears so much similarity the tv series K Street produced by Soderbergh and Clooney that I'd assume they were calling the shots in the editing room if not restructuring the script to fit their cryptic style. I assume even those who were dedicated enough to work out what the film is actually about would have to admit that the statement could have been driven home better with a more coherent narrative.
0440238609|1.0|I have had these books on my shelf for a number of years, having never gotten around to them.  They should have stayed on the shelf, as I now know.   <br /> <br />I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so I recognized many of the tropes that Pullman tries to pull off.  I must say that Holly Lisle pulls off the multiverse much better than he does, and that's not saying a whole lot. <br /> <br />Like most people here, I found myself drawn in by the first book.  That one was well written, if a bit heavy handed in how good Lyra was, how brave she was, how she could do anything even if it was previously impossible for anyone else to do - like break her father out of his Svalbard prison.  However, the books declined in quality from the first page of the second book.  Will takes it much too easily when he finds that he has committed his first murder, especially for a boy of 12.  As a reader, I am willing to suspend belief quite a bit, but this particular plot point snapped that thread for me.  Once that was lost, it was extremely difficult for me to engage myself with the text once again. <br /> <br />As far as the ending goes, what a disappointment.  It seems as if the third book was trying to tell three vastly different stories.  Frankly, if Pullman had created a novel entirely about Mary Malone slipping into the world that she did and studying it in a scientific capacity with no way to return, that would have kept my interest much more than his rabid defamation of Christianity.  Also, Pullman fails to deliver on the cohesion of comparing Mary to the serpent, Lyra to Eve, and Will to Adam.  There was no offering there by Mary of something to tempt Lyra with as happened in the Garden of Eden.  Without this crucial component, there is no way that Lyra can be Eve reincarnate.  <br /> <br />The propaganda that Pullman purports as truth would be all right if he was claiming it as his own, and that if others believed it, that would be okay.  However, he very cleverly lulls the uncareful reader into believing that what he is saying is a universal truth.  I had no idea that atheism was so nihilistic, yet that is the view I came away with when I finished this trilogy.  <br /> <br />I would never recommend these books to anyone.  Rather, I would steer them towards better fantasy novels - like Rowling, Tolkein, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip, and Ursula K le Guin.
B000GRTQSE|1.0|This is the most uninteresting album I've bought all year. 4 Twelve bar blues songs on a 10 track CD shows us where Bob's musical creativity is at. As for his lyrical creativity, these songs do not stimulate me. And some of the more memorable lines seem to be taken from other songs:  <br /> <br />\\"Ain't talkin', just walkin'  <br />Up the road, around the bend.  <br />Heart burnin', still yearnin'  <br />In the last outback at the world's end.\\"   <br /> <br />This is rather similar to the Stanley Brothers' song \\"Highway of Regret\\": <br /> <br />   Ain't talking, just walking <br />   Down that highway of regret <br />   Heart's burning, still yearning <br />   For the best girl this poor boy's ever met  <br /> <br />Bob often lifts lines from old poems and reworks old classic songs that everyone has forgotten. Nothing wrong with that I suppose, as long as it sounds good and interesting (this album doesn't). Plus I don't think littering your songs with bible references make you a literary genius.   <br /> <br />As to the musical side, the musicians on Modern Times are so uninspired that the music itself is not enjoyable enough to bother paying attention to the words. In the end it is annoying, with Bob singing the same melody again and again without variation, in his whiny croak.  <br />
B000GFLAI0|4.0|>   Track 1: Bob kicks in with a boogie beat and his best   swallow-his-nose voice. Honky-tonk piano leads a   clap along rock'n'roll shuffle. Lyrically Bob mixes   natural elements (wind, thunder, rain with personal   insights: \\"I forget about myself, and see to what others   want.\\" You grab his elbows and dance him across   the floor, it's that jaunty.     Track 2: It's an unassuming barroom band atmosphere.   But a shady afternoon bar under palm leaf shadow   giving laid-back Mediterranean warm summer night melody.   Sounds like he's telling some kind of love story.     Track 3: The classic rollin' and tumblin' track. Which   shows that Bob never strays far from his blues roots.   Slide guitar.     Track 4: Bob and his band are supremely relaxed in   the studio and let a long story unravel...   moonlight ballad - Bob is never anything but American -   we're out on the prairie here feeling the wind on our   faces.        Track 5: A shuffle beat filler. You can see how Bob   works here: he takes an everyday situation - a falling   out with a fellow musician in the studio - meditates on   it (as we all mull over our grievances) moves it from the   immediate person and situation and works it out in \\"one   day you ain't gonna work for me no more.\\"     Track 6: Ponderous, building ballad, this orchestral   filler - is it a take-off of Bruce Springsteen?    Actually they're pushing this as one of the outstanding   tracks of the album.  With 99% of his audience in   low paid, exploited work, Bob has to make some   kind of comment on it, to hold his street cred'.    It's interesting, Bob takes a detached outsiders view   of the working man's plight here.  He sympathises   with him and sees his dilemma yet can offer no   real answers, other than -to the Western worker -   `count your blessings', something my father said   forty years before him.   Bob sounds tired and resigned, rather than   angry (as maybe he would have in the `sixties),   `come down to the river anddrink with me to   the working man's blues'.  Little excuses here   that you can't find in the tabloid press.       Track 7: `Beyond the Horizon' You can sway along   with Bob on this one. A tongue in cheek nod to 1930's   country ballads. Love lyric.     Track 8: Punching beat - at last an original format,   Indian drum beat with wise lyrics plus a great   middle eight. THE stand out track!!!     (This ironically titled CD: `Modern Times' - the cover   sleeve gives it away with it's over flashy city car   flashing between myriad skyscrapers. Instead here   Bob takes us away from the stresses and cares of   Modern life to a supposedly more sedate intimate   time - so that when he sings of Washington Ladies   you feel he's talking of 1890's crinolined opera   singers stepping down from a stagecoach rather   than post 9/11 trouser suited starched aides   standing to the left of and slightly back from   the president. Bob's saying don't get to upset and   confused there's always the eternal truths.     Whether this is what his fans want to hear is   another matter.)     Track 9: A direct reference to the Hurricane   Katrina disaster but it becomes a kaleidoscope   of references and observances. This is where   the genius of his poet-self takes over. It's as   if in his flight from the flood the narrator's   life flashes before his eyes.     Track 10: A lament. First of all I think some of   his lyrics her are contrived, but it's a semi-   religious kind of song. He returns to his nineteen-   sixties imagery - who's the gardener?     Bob takes a lot of the `feelings' you've had about   life & the world in the last four years and pots   them (without being specific) into an album.     In the meantime, musically and psychologically,   Dylan's the nearest thing we've got to heaven.
B000001DQG|3.0|I have owned CARIBOU since it was released in 1974 and it is one of Elton's most difficult classic-period studio albums.  No other classic-period album contains musical brilliance mixed with so much material that is average at best.   *Grimsby*, *Solar Prestige a Gammon*, *You're So Static*, *I've Seen the Saucers* and *Stinker* are all okay.  Some of these songs have their moments, the horns on *Stinker* and *You're So Static* for example, but they fail to move me even after repeated listening.  *Grimsby* is the best of the lot.  The rest of the original album is much better.  *Pinky* and *Dixie Lily* are enjoyable, fun songs that lift my spirits.  *The Bitch Is Back* and *Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me* were both hits and each song is great.  *The Bitch Is Back* is an energetic rocker with a great riff, catchy melody and chorus and features great playing from the band.  *Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me* is a beautiful, soaring ballad.  This albums shinning moment is *Ticking*, a song that rivals *Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding* as my all-time favorite Elton John song.  Except for some minimal synthesizer backing, *Ticking* is simply Elton and his piano.  When provided with a platform to display his talents, Elton does not disappoint.  His piano playing is electrifying and breathtaking; his vocals intense and moving.  The lyrics, about a young man who snaps, are disturbing and gripping.  *Ticking* thrills me, moves me deeply and takes me to heights few songs can.  The first time I heard it I thought it shear brilliance.  My opinion has not changed over the years; *Ticking* remains one of my all-time favorite songs.  The bonus tracks *Pinball Wizard* and *Sick City* are welcome additions.  Elton's version of *Pinball Wizard* is fantastic.  Despite the inconsistency,  this is better than just about anything Elton put out after BLUE MOVES until he released SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST.
B000060P79|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. There's no songs on here that I don't like. All of them are great. Especially I'm Just a Kid, I'd Do Anything, and Perfect. I reccomend this to anyone who likes bands such as Yellowcard, The All-American Rejects, and blink-182 or anyone who is looking for some good music to listen too.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|I'm as big a Pearl Jam fan as there is, and out of everything they've ever recorded (all albums and B-sides NOT found on Lost Dogs), this is definitely my least favorite collection of songs save the last track, \\"Inside Job.\\"  Vedder's voice, once on-par with the all-time greats in terms of power, soul, and uniqueness, is now extremely raspy after years of touring and smoking.   <br /> <br />But the bigger problem, I'm afraid, lies in the style of song-writing. I suppose it's a matter of taste, though.  Ever since \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" was released in the Vitalogy era, the band has depended on a punkier, Ramones influenced brand of \\"hard rock\\" that features rapidfire vocals and some fast, monotone drumming, and this just style just isn't for me.  Granted, they HAVE been able to produce a ton of excellent songs that were more experimental (You Are on Riot Act) and folksy (half of the No Code album)and just plain easy to like (Betterman, Indifference, I Am Mine) that really showcased their versatility and talent as musicians. However, saying that the hard rock  songs on this album mark a return to their Ten-era songs (which were darker, edgier, and more inspired by classic rock) would be wholly inaccurate. Go listen to songs like \\"Breath\\", \\"Wash,\\" or \\"State of Love and Trust\\" and tell me that they sound ANYTHING like what's on the new self-titled album. And the softer stuff on the new album just doesn't do it for me--songs like \\"Marker in the Sand\\" and \\"Parachutes\\" seem to chug along without the feeling and creativity of older soft songs like \\"Who We Are\\" and \\"Hard to Imagine.\\" <br /> <br />That being said, a lot of people praise the album, and to each his own.  I do think that the PJ culture (the ones who follow the band around and feel proud that they can sing and clap to every song played =))may try a little too hard to like this album or anything they put out perhaps in an endeavor of unconscious loyalty. I'm guilty of the same thing to a degree, but upon repeated listenings, I had to step back and acknowledge that the new album just isn't as good as their previous work.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This cd is really good! Almost every song on here should be a single. My favorites on the cd are Shut Up!, Welcome To My Life, Crazy, Thank You, Jump, Everytime, and Promise. Notice that I put half of the songs on there. This is one cd that anyone will have a favorite song on.
B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is the first cd I have bought in years that I truly enjoyed every track. So many you buy today, 2 , 3 songs tops and the rest are garbage just thrown in. <br />Not this CD. He grabs you with the first track and keeps you in his hand for the entire CD , mesmerized. <br />Best CD I have heard in years. I look forward to hearing more from this artist.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Just Adam's Song makes this cd worth getting. It is the best song I have ever heard. Besides from it, there are other good ones on the album. All The Small Things was the first blink-182 song I ever heard. I don't understand what it's about, but it is really good. What's My Age Again? has hilarious lyrics, but it is still a great song. blink-182 may be gone, but this cd is still one of the best ones ever.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|On the positive side, nearly every song on this CD is at least good. Some songs are excellent. On the negative side, Rush's in your face progressive rock sound is an influence rather than a focus of the music. I suppose that Rush may have felt the need to try different things and this album is the result. The music on this CD is well-produced and slick, but in its production it does lose some of what has appealed to many Rush fans. In places the music sounds like it was influenced by Foreigner, which is a bit strange given Rush's longevity.<br /><br />'Animate' kicks the CD off with a solid rock beat. The song is solid, but portions of the lyrics are poetry. Strangely, the very interesting portions of the music are balanced by simplistic lyrics modeled a bit after the the Moody Blues' song 'One More Time to Live' from 'Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.' While the lyrics of the latter worked well at the time, I think the 'polarize me, sensitize me, etc.' lyrics of the former could have been approached differently.<br /><br />'Stick It Out' kicks out with power, with better balance between the music and the lyrics. Some of the lyrics are poetic, but the music is pure power to drive the poetry into your brain.<br /><br />'Cut to the Chase' has a strong flavor of the Rush of old and is one of my favorite tracks on this CD. There are a couple of changes in tempo in the music that match the lyrics really well.  The plaintive notes in the instruments complement the vocals nicely; a solid and interesting song all around.<br /><br />I struggle somewhat with 'Nobody's Hero.' The music here is interesting, but the lyrics seem to struggle, either in their fit to the music, or the topic, which seems a bit confused from the outset. While I want to like this song, I suspect the lyrics needed different music and vice versa.<br /><br />Then we come to 'Between Sun and Moon,' a fantasy song in the spirit of progressive rock. One of my favorite songs that combines the power for which Rush is known so well with wonderfully smoky lyrics that are obscure enough to make you feel versus think; a great song to listen to the spell-binding combination of lyrics and music.<br /><br />The next song has a title that makes you think it might be a science fiction song, but 'Alien Shore' is about the difference between male and female. The bass rumble could almost be threatening, but really is trying to hammer the point that we need to understand each other; we need to reach each other; we need to reach the alien shore. This song is solid rock with a modest flavor of blues, and more than a touch of progressive elements.<br /><br />'The Speed of Love' follows. However, the speed seems to be something you would achieve when mired in molasses. The lyrics are too mellow and never break out the way they seem as though they should. The music matches the lyrics, but the change in tempo that you keep expecting just never happens.<br /><br />We change structure and style with 'Double Agent,' which has received mixed reviews. I like this song. I didn't like it at first, but after listening to it numerous times, and reading the lyrics, I believe this song verges on the border of nu-metal or thrash. The hard-driving drums and bass combine with the dark lyrics to yield a surrealistic vision of the land between wake and sleep, between right and wrong, and between darkness and light. A song worth making the attempt to understand in its musical and lyrical entirety.<br /><br />The instrumental 'Leave that Thing Alone' is solid rock. There are moments when you capture a flavor of the Rush from the days of 'Moving Pictures.'<br /><br />The CD closes with 'Cold Fire' and 'Everyday Glory.' The two songs bear some similarity in that they have a certain consistency to them, though the topics are quite different. The songs are decent, but once again they seem a bit tame for Rush, and perhaps a bit on the commercial side.<br /><br />One difficulty with a group such as Rush is that wecontinually expect them to top themselves and when they create acceptable rock, we can be disappointed; we probably should not be. After all, not every work of an artist will be a masterpiece. This album is a worthy addition to your Rush collection; generally good, occasionally excellent, and very accessible throughout.ch as Rush is that we continually expect them to top themselves and when they create acceptable rock, we can be disappointed; we probably should not be.

0060922583|5.0|This is an extraordinary study. To begin with, the author not just has done an extensive study within the vast realm of psychic phenomena, he also, similar to Fritjof Capra, has consulted personally a number of researchers he mentions in his book. Myself a researcher, I know well that there is a difference between knowing a given research from a book, or to be able to interview the author, and thus gain insight into the human experience that is behind the book or research. I have seldom read a study that was both so well-researched and well-written as this book. As Talbot reveals in a few notes, and rather modestly, he has himself strong psychic abilities and was a psychic already as a child. This may explain in part his 'participatory' experience as a scientist and his fundamental comprehension of the topics at stake. Talbot makes a strong point for the holographic nature of the universe and of psychic experiences in general, and I can virtually not see how his theory can be refuted, so well-founded it appears. It just makes sense of so much material that at first sight seems scattered or even completely inconsistent, such as, for example, UFO sightings and alien abduction experiences. Under the header of the holographic view of the universe, not only such experiences, but also so apparently different subjects as Jewish Cabala and Bohm's implicate order interpretation of quantum physics perfectly and intelligently correspond to each other. While I recommend this book without hesitation for the general reader, it should be an advantage to have read previously some kind of fundamental introduction in the new paradigms in science, such as, for example, Fritjof Capra's 'The Turning Point'.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|A remarkable achievement. Intelligent writing and great acting--Hugo in the mask is mesmerizing; Natalie is wonderful to watch; all the other supporting actors are first-rate. A lucidly insightful glimpse at both a potential future AND too-close-to-home  elements of our present time. First-time Director James McTeigue does an excellent job balancing action with wisdom and a touch of irony.<br /><br />Highly enjoyable and thought-provoking, this is a film you will remember long after it's over. Dares to explore--via an action-packed story--what's really behind the BS propaganda that's passed off as \\"truth\\" in our overly distracted times. Question to consider: How can V be called a \\"terrorist\\" when his targets are specific people guilty of terrible crimes and ongoing terror themselves--along with symbolic yet empty buidlings--as opposed to \\"innocent bystanders\\" and/or noble leaders? For example, had he been around in Germany in the early 1940's and taken out Hitler, Himmler and Goebbles while also blowing up the Reichstag and the Nazi judicial court headquarters, wouldn't most everyone cheer him on? Makes you think, especially when viewing current world events with an eye for the truth behind the facade...
0393061310|5.0|We all know the story of the origin of man in Africa, the spreading of mankind throughout the world, the rise of agriculture in the fertile crescent and then the growth of civilization in the Middle East, China, Europe and America with Europe conquering the New World and then somewhat (though this may be changing now) dominating the Far East.<br /><br />What Diamond strives to answer is why did culture and power evolve this way?<br /><br />His answers revolve around:<br /><br />Available crops for domestication<br /><br />Available animals for domestication<br /><br />Ease Of Technology transfer (east/west is easier than north/south and mountains and oceans are a problem)<br /><br />Diamond painstakingly goes through the diffences between various areas of the world.  Focusing mainly on non-Western societies, he points out how they were handicapped by lack of resources (fewer available plants and animals) and also in the case of America, by time.<br /><br />Taking issue with the spotlight reviews, Diamond is not a 100% determinist.  Regarding the New World, he describes several of the bad decisions those societies made when interacting with the Europeans, clearly causing their societal collase to accelerate.  In the sections dealing with China, he details various human factirs that drove the Chinese to abandon their navies and much of their technology in the 1400s, stagnating for a precious few centuries when Europe moved forward.<br /><br />This synthesis of geographical determinism ALONG WITH choice is continued in Collapse. taking the two together should give you a good understanding of Diamond.<br /><br />Both books are excellent and must read for any serious student of history.  5 stars
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Excellent film.  Excellent cast.   <br /> <br />From the opening of the film to the close of the film, the characters ring true.  We all knew people like this in high school and some of us were these people.  <br /> <br />Quoteable up one wall and down the other, this film is painfully real at the dance.  SO well shot, looking over the shoulders of Napoleon, Deb and Pedro as they watch the popular crowd enjoy the frivolity of their youth while these 3 trudge through their days.   <br /> <br />However, Napoleon refuses to give up the fight and makes a stand for Pedro and makes his dreams come true.
B000002GY9|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this.  The blues, Waits.  This is my favorite.  Smoke-filled.  Poetry.  The mood of this CD reminds me of old Long Beach, California, when the Pike was there.  An amusement park where the amusements have turned seedy and whiskey-soaked.  I have this CD set on my alarm clock.  I wake up to it every morning.  It reminds me of worlds and people I've known.  And every day, it makes me fall in love with Tom Waits.  Sure is nice waking up with you, baby.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Best film of my entire life.  I am an avid fan of Peter Pan, both the play, the musical and the Disney version.   <br /> <br />This film blends sweetness, sadness and virtual brilliance.  Johnny Depp plays a perfect JM Barrie, a man torn between childhood and adult responsibilites.  Barrie himself, mirror Peter Pan a bit of course. <br /> <br />If one reads \\"Inventing Wonderland\\" by Jackie Wullschlager, it is clear that there can be severl interpretations of the creation of Peter Pan, Winnie the Pooh, The Owl and the Pussycat and Through the Looking Glass.  The problem is one of paradigm shifts.   <br /> <br />In Victorian England, children were seen as the epitomy of society and romanticized.  For a grown man to use children as a muse was not seen as something odd or strange.   <br /> <br />Johnny Depp shows the perfect balance of reservation and release when he is with the children through his imagination.  His relationship with his wife is shown beautifully.   <br /> <br />I too would have to disagree with the writer that stated that the \\"real story\\" of the creation of Peter Pan would diminish the love of this film.  Knowing the \\"true story\\" simply allowed me to fill in blanks that the film glossed over or changed.   <br /> <br />Biggest change in my opinion was the change of JM Barrie's childhood muses' mother to a widow from a married woman (which was the true story).   <br /> <br />The small boy that played Peter was so good, Johnny Depp recommended him by name for Charlie in Tim Burton's amazing remake of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" which was closer to the book than the wonderful but flawed Gene Wilder version that painted Willy Wonka as an eccentric rather than a sadistic character.   <br /> <br />JM Barrie was Peter Pan and this film boasts a deeply moving  performance from both Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp.  The film will move you to tears many times.  It is remnicent of Tim Burton's \\"Big Fish\\" in its ultimate goal, to always have a zest for life and live life to its fullest. <br /> <br />The best scene in the film to me was Johnny Depp in his writers chair staring out the window and his wife's longing for him to let her into his world.   <br /> <br />Bottom line, Finding Neverland may be a \\"fudge\\" on some facts but the story breaks down the creation well and gives us an insight into a timeframe and a man.  The man that was Peter Pan.
B00005JP87|3.0|\\"The Illusionist\\", written by Neil Burger and Steven Millhauser; directed by Neil Burger.<br /><br />A gentle boy with a knack for trickery falls in love with a beautiful girl named Sophie.  Unfortunately, she is of noble birth, so she is taken away, their love is impossible.  Shattered, the boy immerses himself ever deeper in the world of illusion, transforming himself into Eisenheim (Edward Norton), master magician.  One day at a performance in Vienna, Sophie (Jessica Biel) appears in the audience.  Now she is the intended of the Crown Prince, who is cruel.  His power is great, and his rivals are watched by Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), who trades information for influence.  Eisenheim and Sophie still love one another, but what power does magic have in the real world?  Is Eisenheim simply a magician, or something more?<br /><br />It's as simple as a fairy tale, and for most of its running time, \\"The Illusionist\\" is a lovely, compelling, surprising one.<br /><br />The production is supported well on all sides.  Philip Glass produces one of the most varied scores of his career. Ondrej Nekvasil's production design is darkly beautiful, and Dick Pope's photography and adoption of silent film grammar are thoughtfully done.  Paul Giamatti, while a bit compressed in a husky growl, is still fine.  Rufus Sewell's prince is solid and threatening without becoming cartoonish.<br /><br />While the love story is not as strong as it could be - Norton is a bit cool to the touch, and Biel, while not exactly miscast, isn't the ideal choice for the role - it still works.  I was drawn into the struggle for love, and the illusions are portrayed with the proper tone of wonder, even if we know that film allows for much trickery of its own.  The digital work is suitably understated, and reinforces the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after being draped in cloaks of ambiguity and possibility, the film flings them back in a reasonable, predictable conclusion.  The disappointment is underscored by the fact the filmmakers are convinced they've surprised you, and spool off plot point after plot point that they've carefully (and rather obviously) set up earlier.  Like many recent films, it would be much improved by a loss of about fifteen minutes, and a little more open-endedness.tment is underscored by the fact the filmmakers are convinced they've surprised you, and spool off plot point after plot point that they've carefully (and rather obviously) set up earlier.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This film is one of my favorites.  I am a self-proclaimed Tim Burton fanatic but this one is really up there for me.      Ewan McGregor does a fantastic job as the main character but the crux of this film is the relationship between he and his son.  Through his father's stories, one thread remained true, family was always family.  As the witch in the town Edward Bloom tried to save said, \\"It was always your mother\\".  Every woman always came back to Jessica Lange's character for Edward Bloom.      Like most of us, Ewan McGregor was a mix of fact and fiction.  His life was made better because he made it that way.  His son found this at his death, before most of us really meet our father.  Most of us really get to know our dad's after they are gone when it is too late.  OK, I'm siging \\"Mike and the Mechanics\\", \\"In the Living Years\\" right now.  We usually cannot accept them as they are when they are here.    Jessica Lange was an awesome addition to the cast as Ewan McGregor's wife.  As we find in the end of the film, many of the \\"characters\\" from the \\"tall tales\\" were real people that knew and loved Billy Crudup's father.      A life well lived can be quiet and uneventful but a life well lived can also be told in technicolor.  We are called to dream the dreams and make our imaginations color our worlds.  How many really do that in their mundane lives?    This film reminded me of James Blunt's CD \\"Back to Bedlam\\".  It makes you believe in true love standing the test of time again.  It is not syrupy and it is not fake.  Time really does stand still when you first see your true love, that may be the enduring legacy of this film, that life is what you make it, even if you make it up as you go along!
B00005O5UA|5.0|this cd hasn't left my cd player since i got it.  it's just plain good music and reminds me of what we lost when freddy mercury died.  one of my favorite tunes is \\"a winter's tale.\\"  it just touches my heart every time ever time hear it...  the remaining members definitely did a fantastic job of releasing a posthumous cd.  This is definitely a must cd for any serious queen fan.
B00005JP0A|4.0|Cute story about a young college graduate seeking to become a journalist and takes a job working for a fashion magazine under Miranda Priestly, the demanding high-powered executive whose connections extend across the globe.  <br /> <br />Although the movie center's wound Anne Hathaway's character, Meryl Streep steals the show.  Her represntation of the dragon lady boss was dead on!  Not the high-octane-greedy-loud-mouthed CEO so typical of Hollywood films, but a very realistic view of Bosses at the top and the manner in which their subordinates react to meet their demands. She's controlled, soft spoken, unyielding and very firm...and she knows the business better than anyone else.   It's funny to watch people scramble to meet her impossible demands.  <br /> <br />Amazing clothes!  I have a new appreciation for the fashion industry.  I didn't realize so much went into it. Enjoyable chick flick with amazing couture.
B00005JOX6|5.0|I'm so surprised when I read someone's scathing review of this movie.  I laughed so hard SOOOO many times, and CRIED at the poignant scenes when he finds out his father passed away *AND* at the scene with his \\"final\\" moments with his family (his parting gesture to Bill was great!).  I'm not usually a slapstick movie fan, and in general I think Adam Sandler's movies are a little crude for my liking.  BUT... This movie had so many clever scenes and was so easy to relate to (who these days doesn't have an overworked husband??), I LOVED it.  The first time (of a total of SIX times) my son and I saw this movie, we both said, \\"We are SO getting this movie when it comes out on DVD!\\"  It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it really makes you THINK.  And the bratty kid next door...  Who hasn't known a kid like that?  And Adam Sandler's character gets him back every time! <br /> <br />Bottom line?  It's a hilarious movie.  BUY IT!!!  It's definitely a keeper worth watching multiple times!
0393327655|5.0|Excellent book.  Interesting parallels with religion and reason.  Great citations for more reading on specific topics and clarification.  What is truly incredible, is that in history, we have seen this type of behavior (ideologies) numerous times as Sam Harris states and really makes some great conclusions.  The sad problem, however, is there really may not ever be a solution to a person's belief system and therefore their reasoning for actions in life.

0375703861|5.0|White Teeth fully qualifies as a refreshing novel. The characters are lively, identifiable and rich. I also found the dialogue to be rich, one of the reasons that kept the book interesting throughout the read. I was entranced as to what is coming next and kept on reading and reading until the last page.I also recommend Disciples of Fortune, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, The Line of Beauty,The Usurper and others for their depth among other things.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Ray LaMontagne's music is beyond anything I have experienced before. Each song slowly enters you and each time you hear it, you feel it more. All of Mr. LaMontagne's songs have become part of me. I feel each song and love them all. Everytime I listen to his music, I am still moved and shocked that someone is so talented. I feel sorry for the people who will never hear his songs, but I thank God everyday that I found Ray LaMontagne's music. Thank you Mr. LaMontagne for sharing part of yourself with the world.
0761119752|5.0|We've checked out a number of Boynton books from our library, and Pajama Time is the first one my daughter has really loved.  She just turned two, and she is always asking for \\"Jammie Time\\" to be read to her, especially when we are getting her ready for bed.  I like how the book can be sung, which always brings a smile to my daughter's face.  The pictures and words are silly and seem to be very appealing to toddlers.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|An interesting film that came out a few years ago, sky captain and the world of tommorrow was a film I had wrote off as something that would be rediculous.  Now that i took the chance to watch it, I am actually suprised, It was kind of entertaining. This movie is based on the concept of what people may have thought future technologies would have looked like in the late 1930's .  It reminds me of a flash gordon tale, or of some of the old Superman cartoons.  Sky captain Joe and his former reporter girlfriend Polly find themselves in the middle of the doomsday plan, and they are the only ones that can stop it. Right from the begining, the effects and cinemetograph is unique, seeming similar to what was used in the recent King Kong movie of last winter.  The effects are what you would expect, many computer generated blue screen shots, but I enjoyed that many of the ships,planes and machines where thing that a kid might dream of, and seemed like a elaborate old comic book. Just cool. Take a look at this film, it may be a far fetched plot like flash gordon of that era, but take it in the text of fantasyt of a comic book, like superman, batman, the hulk etc, and I think you might enjoy it.
B00005JP5L|5.0|This very funny comedy concerns old Olive, a sweet little seven-year old who wants to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.  She lives with her eccentric family in New Mexico, so the whole brood piles into the old VW bus for a road trip, and there's never a dull moment.  Her father (played by Greg Kinnear) is a failed motivational speaker, her grandfather (Alan Arkin) is a trouble-making curmudgeon, her uncle (Steve Carell) is suicidal, her mother (Toni Collette) is always screaming, and her alienated fifteen-year old brother refuses to speak.  They all go through a lot on the trip, are deeply affected by changes, and leave California stronger than ever.<br /><br />The excellent ensemble cast and surprisingly clever script make this a genuinely funny comedy with many laugh-out-loud moments and just the right blend of serious and touching and manically silly.  Except for the constant use of foul language, it's a movie everyone could enjoy.  The script gives each member of the family plenty of time to shine, and each part was perfectly-cast.  I left the theatre with a smile on my face, glad that I saw this movie, and that's something that doesn't happen often these days.
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|I got this DVD hoping for more actual documentary on the Titanic. Instead it's all behind-the-scenes and about the movie itself. Not worth the extra $$. Just get the regular DVD single.<br /><br />It has nothing but the movie (and trailer). And it's cheaper.

0694013889|5.0|At my house, we read this with a silly British accent. It's a cute book that introduces the basic terminology of the potty with a little girl who demonstrates its use. I do think it helped my daughter be inspired to use the potty just like the girl in the book. My sister was embarrassed to read it to her because it shows (with a non-detailed illustration) what goes into the potty and where it comes out. I'm all for telling my child the truth and this does it.
B000002UTY|5.0|\\"Happy Trails\\" is hands-down the best album Quicksilver ever recorded.  The \\"Who Do You Love\\" medley is one of the best, if not the best, extended West Coast \\"psychedelia\\" jams ever recorded.  They take another Bo Diddley song, \\"Mona\\", and make it their own.  The sound quality of this CD is first rate.  The only downside is the lack of liner notes.
B000002IGV|5.0|While many people know Twisted Sister best, for \\"We're Got Gonna Take it\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\", they had more to offer than just those two songs. Stay Hungry is a very solid metal album. This is one of those albums that demands to be played loud. From the opener \\"Stay Hungry\\" through \\"S.M.F.\\" the album never gets dull. Besides the obivious hits other highlights include the title track, The Price, Horror Teria, Don't Let Me Down, but the album as a whole is very enjoyable. It's to bad that they couldn't maintain their popularity after Stay Hungry, cause Twisted Sister was actually a pretty good band. This album deserves a spot in any reall rock n roll collection.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written, that is how strongly I feel about this movie.  I first watched this movie in the theater when I was 15.  I must have watched it 5 times alltogether.  I was mesmorized by the dance sequences.  I didn't know how mere mortals could soar and spin even though \\"this is not ice skating\\".  The story was also gripping and compelling.  I have waited for so long for this to come out on DVD and it's finally here.  I also thought it had an incredible soundtrack.  A must see.
068817776X|5.0|Normally I am not a fan of non-fiction, in fact I normally avoid it completely, but a friend of mine suggested this book and I am very glad I gave in and read it.  This book is wonderful and provides an interesting view into the sociology and psycology of Germany before and during WWII.  It is hard to believe that this amazing story is about a real person and not a fictional one.  I highly recommend this book to not only people who love history, but also those who are interested in stories about life changing events and triumph over adversity.

B000HCO840|1.0|After X2, my expectations were high for the 3rd.  Then Bryan Singer left to make Superman (and took writers with him) and my expectations dropped, not sharply, but dropped nonetheless.  When  Brett Ratner got the job as director, my expectations dropped again.  Granted, the only films of his I've seen are the Rush Hour movies, but I just couldn't see how a guy who directed action/comedy was going to capture the drama necessary to make an X-men film good.<br /><br />Well, he certainly did not manage it.  The action was alright, but not particularly interesting.  The comic moments WERE often fabulous, but the dramatic moments were just painful.  You do not, for one moment, believe anything that is happening on the screen.  I'd compare the dramatic scenes to the Star Wars prequels.  Yes, THAT painful, and that disappointing when compared to the prior films in the series.<br /><br />If you like mindless action and some amusing dialogue, go ahead and watch it.  Oh, also if you're a Beast fan, rent it, if just to watch his scenes, because Kelsey Grammer was perfect in the role, but aside from that, just don't have any expectations.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|When I found out that they were releasing a special edition for SEX AND THE CITY, I simply had to have it. This show has been the mantra and inspiration for so many women like me, but when I found out the price the only thing I could think was OUCH!... The truth is that if you haven't seen the package in person, any of the pictures doesn't do justice. All the disks come in a sort of diary kind of presentation, with all the episodes taglines and reviews, plus amazing extras. The pink velvety cover has embeded the sillouette of New York City and the title, and it looks ohhhh so Carrie-like... and on top of that, the book comes inside of an acrilic crystal-like box, that makes it look just like a jewel. <br />As you can imagine I ended up buying the thing, and it even decorates beautifully my room. Its a great buy for any fan of the show, and for those that already bought the separete seasons on those godawful packages, you better start selling those at marketplace cause you want to have this edition before it runs out!
B00005NWLO|4.0|This is excellent. The only drag and reason it's not 5 stars is the bonus tracks don't give you any real variety. It may just have been the set's they were playing at the time. But it's top notch quality white hot <br />Skynyrd.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|The times, they are a stayin' the same.<br /><br />Not that I'm complaining, mind you. Bob Dylan's had an incomparable musical career, re-inventing himself more often and more successfully than most artists ever dare, writing great songs at an age when most artists are content to just write their name on the back of their royalty checks. \\"Modern Times\\" feels like marking time, though. It's not exactly another side of Bob Dylan--more like a co-mingling of the world-weary lovesick troubador from \\"Time Out of Mind\\"  and the travelling minstrel that stole the show on \\"Love and Theft,\\" with a little of the religious Bob thrown in to keep things interesting.<br /><br />To Dylan's great credit, he makes these old roads feel somewhat new. \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" is a rousing rockabilly number with lyrics that remind us what the music already did--Dylan's willing to undo Neil Young's false dichotomy by neither burning out nor fading away. \\"You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away. The writing on the wall, come see it, come see what it say,\\" he intones in a raspy growl. Is he reverting to his post-conversion Bob-the-Baptist fervor, or just reminding us he's still going? Either way, it works.<br /><br />\\"Spirit on the Water\\" gives us a mellow lounge-y track with lyrics as lovesick as \\"Lovesick Blues.\\" Only now he feels serene, at peace with these tangled emotions at last. \\"You think I'm over the hill. You think I'm past my prime. Let me see what you got. We can have a whoppin' good time,\\" he says, perhaps to a younger lover about to leave, perhaps to us. He's staying true even if we aren't; \\"When the Deal Goes Down\\" is a stately reflection on fidelity in the twilight years.<br /><br />There may be no way for Dylan to top the monuments he's already erected along the way. But he does save the best for last on this album, with \\"Ain't Talkin',\\" a lovely song with weepy strings that amplify his end-of-the-road aches and pains. \\"I'm tryin' to love my neighbor and do good to others, but, mother, things ain't been well,\\" he sings.<br /><br />Of course, what ain't well for him is still well for us. \\"And you sat behind a million pair of eyes and told them how they saw,\\" David Bowie sang about Dylan way back in 1971. Lately, he's moved on from poet to prophet, telling us what we will see, rather than what we do see. And thanks to this album, we have another compelling glimpse of the lonely road ahead.and do good to others, but, mother, things ain't been well,\\" he sings. <br /> <br />Of course, what ain't well for him is still well for us. \\"And you sat behind a million pair of eyes and told them how they saw,\\" David Bowie sang about Dylan way back in 1971.

B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna's first album, here nicely remastered with a few extra remixes tossed in, remains a modern day classic. <br />Listening to this record will immediately transport you back to those heady days in the mid-80's where this music was inescapable. You could spend your Saturday night in a dance club and hear most of these songs played once...most twice. <br />The songs are true classics of their genre. <br />\\"Lucky Star\\", \\"Borderline\\" and \\"Holiday\\" are dance songs that have been embraced by a generation. Say what you want about Madonna's limited range, but she uses it in it's entirety, and uses it as good as anyone.  <br />You KNOW these songs. You'll be singing along, and you won't be able to help yourself. <br />The songs have strong melodies, not that common amongst club songs. The production is similarly strong, and remember, she wasn't anybody yet. She was great out of the box. Now you expect polished production...but she got it from square one. <br />Other songs, like \\"Burning Up\\" (a terrific, up-tempo \\"rock\\" screamer), \\"Physical Attraction\\" and \\"Everybody\\" (two ubiquitous club songs that were played as alternatives to the big hits) make this an impressive debut. For many, \\"Burning Up\\" is the highlight of the album. <br />It's hard to think of it now, being that she's one of the biggest pop stars we've had in the last twenty years, but at the time, she was the underdog pop princess who came out of nowhere. <br />I was surprised how much I still like this album...
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I never heard of Ray LaMontagne before - and once I listened to it I was hooked.  It may be the record of the year for me.  Although this music is unique, it reminds me of John Lennon and Bap Kennedy blended together... every cut on this CD is great!! Although the vocals are wonderful, I long for more instrumental cuts -listen to \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\" and you will know why.
B000062X90|5.0|Finally; and what a pleasant surprise.  30 years ago I was introduced to this great album while living in England. Heard it in pubs, on university student stereos - was never really aware of the sound quality issues. <br /> <br />A few years later, bought the LP here in the States.  Still a great album, obviously, but the sound quality was mung.  Muddy, rolled-off treble, boomy bass.....First time I was playing it on good equipment, and - well, it was disappointing. <br /> <br />The original CD release did not, of course, improve the situation at all. <br /> <br />BUT, now, finally, on this Remaster, the sound quality has really been vastly improved.  And the 3 bonus tracks (live) at the end are excellent additions - not just filler. <br /> <br />If you've liked or loved or heard great things about this terrific album, invest a few bucks to get this new Remaster.  It's MUCH better than any previous release, INCLUDING the vinyl. <br /> <br />Enjoy.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I bought the cd and dvd yesterday. First of all the dvd is very good it is something that will stay with you and so will this cd. I love Bob Dylan. I have heard all of his cds and this is his best. Every song has a good beat it also reminds you of blues too. His writing is outstanding. I would say go out and buy this set the dvd and cd it is well worth your money. This is one cd you will love. I will listen to it many times. I like every song on the cd but my favs are Thunder On The Mountain, Spirit On The Water, Rollin' And Tumblin', The Levee's Gonna Break. Please buy this cd you won't regret it.
0060594888|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  I wish every single person in America would pick up this book and learn the number one principle to success.

To discover this in one book is such a treasure!<br /><br />The teaching tool E + R = O (Event + Response = Outcome) is nothing short of brilliant.  This formula has taught me that every outcome I experience in life (success, failure, wealth, illness, and loss of job) was a result of how I responded to an earlier event or events in my life.  Taking 100% and nothing less, has taught me that if I do not like the results that I am currently getting, I have basically two choices.  I can blame the event (E) or my lack of results (O) or I can change my responses (R) to the events (E) until I get the outcome (O) I want.  I now see that all my blaming, complaining and criticizing has done but cause myself pain and suffering.<br /><br />Taking 100% Responsibility is about my ability to choose how I respond to events in my life.  It sounds so simple, but it is extremely powerful.  But only if one desires success.<br /><br />Warning:  This book can and will change your life!<br /><br />Scott Whitelaw
0452270073|5.0|Regeneration, though told mainly from Sigfried Sassoon's perspective, has a variety of different perspectives that, through their common time at the Craiglockhart Hospital and their separate experiences and changes, are shared. Despite the fact that the patients are not children, Regeneration leaves the reader with the feeling that whatever innocence each of the characters had is now lost, and their lives forever changed. Being told from Sassoon's perspective, who was opposed to the war, is interesting and definitely de-romanticizes it, thus creating a more realistic experience for the reader. Sassoon's encounters with Dr. Rivers are interesting as well because Rivers' attachment to each of his patients creates an ongoing internal debate about his work and its effects on its patients. These 'episodes' of interal debate, reflection and nostalgia provide realistic insight to the struggles and concerns of doctors during that era. Pat Barker's accurate descriptions and distinct writing style MAKES the reader live through and understand the atrocities that the soldiers from WWI did.
B000G03Q2S|4.0|First of all, this review has nothing to do with the quality of the album. We all know how great this album is. Just a couple of thoughts about this specific product. This is why I'm giving 4 stars.<br /><br />First,all of the content on the CD is exactly the same as on the previous mono/stereo release. But, that's to be expected, right?.<br /><br />You're probably saying to yourself that the real value is in the DVD. Well, all of the DVD material has been released before, except the \\"Good Vibrations\\" promo and a short featurette from the BBC where George Martin visits Brian and they discuss songwriting and arrangement. The \\"documentaries\\" are edited together from the Endless Harmony DVD and the promo material found on the DVD Audio version of the album. Also, some of the interview footage found on Brian's Pet Sounds Live DVD is also included.  You also get the hi-res stereo and 5.1 mixes of the album that were included on the above mentioned DVD-A.<br /><br />So basically, if you already own the original album, the DVD-A version, and the Endless Harmony and Pet Sounds Live DVDS, you already have everything on this set except for a brief George Martin interview and a \\"Good Vibrations\\" video.<br /><br />I was kind of disappointed with the limited edition packaging, as well. The two discs are housed in a velvet-type covered case with the original CD booklet with all of the production and mixing notes stapled in the middle. This booklet appears to be the same old one that was used with the mono/stereo combo disc, save for the DVD credits. The actual liner notes appear the same.<br /><br />You know, I feel like Capitol has wasted two great Beach Boys opportunites with the products they released for the anniversaries of Good Vibrations and Pet Sounds. It seems that they just throw previously released material together in one package and tack on one unreleased item for each and put it out for the fans to buy (again, for the most part). You would think that they would have more respect for the legacy of these recordings.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm through ranting. If you already have Pet Sounds but you want something extra, pick up the Pet Sounds Sessions box set and skip this CD/DVD. The box is pricey, but you get a better sense of what went into the album.they would have more respect for the legacy of these recordings.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm through ranting.

1401301010|5.0|I'm sure that there are many musicians/actors who would like to think they had a rough upbringing or caught some tough breaks in life.  I have a difficult time imagining that many of their autobiographies can even come close to that of Anthony Kiedis.  I was taken aback by the completely honest, naked telling of his life up until a few years ago.  Unlike many other musicians, he has managed to maintain a high level of privacy to his love life and addiction.  Most people would cherish that image and refuse to open themselves up for the whole world to see/read but Kiedis shares his personal trials and professional triumphs with mutual detail.  I didn't want it to end and hope he'll write another one in 10 more years.
B000001GYC|5.0|Bach's 48 preludes and fugues seem to me to be to some extent a diary of the composer's feelings, and I get much the same impression from Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words, which are also 48 in number. To me, they are beautiful and touching minor masterpieces and when I hear them I am not disturbed, or even visited, by the thought that they are not masterpieces to rank with Bach's. However I am not as exacting in evaluating a performance of them as I would be with Bach either, and when I willingly award this set 5 stars I know that I'm setting the bar lower. There are limits to what any interpreter, even the greatest, of the Songs Without Words can find in them, but for all that some interpreters are greater than others, and I happen to know even better accounts of some of these pieces than you will find on these two discs from Barenboim.<br /><br />It was high time in any case that I had a complete set of these lovely works. My collection up to now had only stretched to 14 of them, but - I have to say it again - those 14 are enough to teach me the difference between fine performances and great ones. Barenboim's accounts should be easily good enough for most of us most of the time, and in addition to the Songs he throws in the Children's Pieces plus a few other short numbers that Mendelssohn, for reasons known principally to himself, chose not to publish. With one solitary exception, Barenboim's touch is affectionate, warm and beautiful, and is well served by the 1974 recording. Speeds adopted sound about right to me in general, and the interpretations offered are full of insight and loving care, and free from eccentricity or egotism. Barenboim can be powerful when he needs to be, but the requirement for power is very limited in what we have here, and the overall impression that the set leaves is rightly one of tact, sympathy and enthusiasm. My single regret concerns my own favourite of all the Songs - the Duetto op 38/6. Something goes quite unaccountably wrong here. I'd call the speed too fast in the first place, and I would have liked the pseudo-voices brought out more strongly against the arpeggio accompaniment, but the real affront to my sensibilities comes when the two voices sing forte in octaves, and Barenboim bangs out the melody in a bad-tempered and cacophonous way that reminds me of one of Kissin's off-days.<br /><br />One botched effort out of 58 is not a bad ratio nevertheless. I can play the Duetto to my own satisfaction anyway, or I can listen to it on my old Turnabout LP played by Guiomar Novaes. Novaes seems to be all but forgotten these days, but she was a great player, recognised as such by no less than Debussy when she was a teenager. Her idea of the Duetto is slower than mine, indeed for an amateur like me the piece, which lies beautifully and naturally under the hands, seems practically to dictate its own speed. However it's not the tempo that makes the impression. In this piece as in many others starting with the very first of all the Songs, what transfixes me is the haughty and highlighted clarity of Novaes's melodic line and the magnificence of her left-hand tone. It also happens that in the disc that accompanies the biography of Serkin by Stephen Lehmann and Marion Faber there are two of the Songs in Novaes's selection - a solemn and gripping op 62/1 and a coruscating Spinning Song worthy of Horowitz or Cziffra for virtuosity. The point is simply this - there is an aura of greatness that surrounds the playing of Serkin and Novaes in practically anything they do. Admirable as he is, Barenboim is not quite in that league, although I don't consider the balance of advantage to be totally one-sided, and it may be that Barenboim actually makes a more appealing job of the Spring Song.<br /><br />Nevertheless I have only 14 of the Songs from Novaes, and all of two from Serkin, in somewhat antiquated sound at that. Barenboim gives me all 48 plus some bonus extras, played with love and appreciation of the soulof this beautiful and affecting music. This is a set I am going to be returning to for solace and balm to the spirit, I can tell already. The recorded sound is not wondrous, but it's good 1974 quality. The liner note is from the distinguished pen of Joan Chissell, but I can't say it seems to me to amount to much. Moreover she nails her colours to the mast with the ringing challenge `No 19th-century composer exceeded Mendelssohn in respect for Classical tradition, and such ordered modes of expression as fugue...' I dispute this strenuously. Not only are Mendelssohn's fugues not his best or most professional work, as Tovey makes very clear, they are inferior in respect for classical precedent and thoroughness of workmanship to Schumann's, as the same sage also points out. Besides which Brahms was a musical scholar of minute and profound learning, particularly steeped in the great German musical tradition, to an extent that Mendelssohn never rivalled. What Mendelssohn can claim is to be sui generis, what he does best he does better than anyone, and some of his most intimate musical thoughts are to be found in the Songs Without Words.  For the pleasure and comfort they bring me I thank Mendelssohn's shade and the loving and expert guidance of Barenboim.the soul of this beautiful and affecting music.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I've been waiting for the return of the Doctor Who series to America for sometime now. And I guess last year's incarnation really had me surprised. I really thought they were going to mess this one up royally like the last attempt with a bad two hour teevee film that stunk, but it would seem like they are on the right track now. The first season seemed upbeat and current, no campy special effects and really no emphasis on special effects but great to decent stories ripe with dry British humor. I hope the Scifi Channel gets with the program and shows the second season with a new Doctor. I am tired of seeing awful SciFi Channel movies about giant insects.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|It is quite possible that \\"Veronica Mars\\" is the greatest show on television. It is the rare show that is infinitly watchable but rewards you if you watch it every week. It can be alternatingly funny and heartbreaking, clever and straight. The writting is consistantly the strongest on any television show currently on the air, and the show has a style all its own. <br />For those who have yet to watch this second season when it was on the air on the UPN last year(I have actually met a few people who refused to watch it just so they could get this DVD and take it all in in one compacted week), let me just say that you are in for a treat. Multiple mysteries unravel each week, with at least three season long arcs and plethora of multiple episode arcs competing for attention. It is too the credit of the writers that the show never feels convuluted or complicated, probably because the writers always keep the focus of every story exactly where it should be, on the principal charactors. It also doesn't hurt that this season features the three best episodes of the show thus far: \\"Donut Run\\", the postively brilliant \\"Plan B\\" and the flawless, twisty finale \\"Not Pictured\\", where even a few lingering doubts are answered once and for all from season one. Where are the Emmy nods for this writting staff? <br />Speaking of non-existant award nominations, \\"Mars\\" has, now that \\"Arrested Development\\" has gone the way of the buffalo, the best ensemble cast of any show currently on the air, anywhere. Not enough praise can be given to Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantino, who belong in a \\"Thin Man\\" movie thanks to their flawless delivery and timing, but the rest of the cast is equally good and underrated to the point of confusion. Francis Capra, who plays biker Weevil on the show, emits cool from his every pore, while Percy Daggs III, as Veronica's best friend Wallace, is the shows secret weapon, for lack of a better phrase. His cool, easy going charisma is the perfect counterpart to Bell'squickwitted charactor. The show wouldn't be half as good without the amazing Jason Dohring, as poor little rich boy Logan Echolls, an actor who never feels forced and seems to be having a great time playing the questionable Logan. Newcomer to the show Kyle Secor is also excellent in a key role. Only Teddy Dunn as Duncan fails to impress on the level of his co-stars, though playing a charactor who is on anti-depressants as a straight laced, slightly monotone cat may just be the greatest acting job ever. I have yet to make up my mind. And the litay of supporting charactors, most notably Harry Hamlin, who fans will recognize as Aaron Echolls from season one, Charisma Carpenter and the Gute himself, Steve Guttenberg(you read that right), are all excellent in important recurring roles. <br />\\"Veronica Mars\\" is a rare treat on television, a show that rewards you for paying attention and demands you have an attention span greater then that of a two year old. With two flawless seasons behind it, I can hardly wait until \\"Mars\\" is back this fall on the CW. Bring it on.

B00004RD54|5.0|The intricate, extensive and sublimely rocking introduction to \\"Sweet Jane\\" which opens ROCK & ROLL ANIMAL must have made many of this album's earliest buyers think they'd fallen victim to a record company foul-up. Surely the soaring guitars, thundering bass and tight, swirling drums with which they were confronted couldn't have had anything to do with Lou Reed, legendarily laconic purveyor of atonal drones and decadent, rambling anecdotes. But sure enough, after three and a half minutes all that virtuosic showboating somehow morphed into the beloved Velvet Underground classic, with Reed tossing off his lines in a voice by turns sardonic, indifferent and haunted. The result was, and still is, an album both the hardcore Reed fan and the Reed-hating hard rocker can dig, an eminently successful experiment in classic seventies metal from a man whose prior recordings had firmly established him at the opposite pole of the sonic spectrum.     In truth, however, ANIMAL is less a Lou Reed album than an album of Lou Reed songs as (stunningly) interpreted by what was then Alice Cooper's touring band. The leader's presence here, while significant in establishing the requisite dark, dissipated and druggy ambience, is ultimately more counterpoint than fulcrum. Instead, it's the beautiful picking of guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, Ray Colcord's nightmarish organ runs and the stop-on-a-dime interplay of bassist Prakash John and drummer Pentti Glan that are the real story, offering up post-Allman Brothers reinventions of Velvets nuggets like \\"Heroin,\\" \\"White Light, White Heat\\" and \\"Rock & Roll\\" as well as several tracks from Reed's outrageously underrated BERLIN LP. What starts out looking like the most awkward of musical marriages ends up being one of rock's all-time greatest live albums, its dynamism literally unflagging from one end to the other. Recommended for...well, you.

The man who gave us \\"the ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face\\" 40 years ago continues to amaze.<br /><br />Modern Times is Dylan's best work since Infidels, and that's saying a lot. This is a great band, producing a new version of \\"that thin, that wild mercury sound\\" that is characteristic of Dylan at his best. Here it is polished, tracing a razor's edge, at times seductive, at times raising the hair on the back of your neck.<br /><br />It is remarkable what Dylan, at age 65, is able to do with his voice. To me it never sounded better. Yeah, I know his range is shot and that it's raspy and raw. But the phrasing is complex and precise, it hits every time, and the range of emotion that's conveyed is without compare. Nobody ever said that Dylan is an operatic singer, but he's an incredible vocalist, and Modern Times sets a new standard for this greatness.<br /><br />The songs flow together, contrast with, and build off one another. This is an \\"album\\" in the classic sense; buying individual songs or shuffling them will lose a lot.<br /><br />So for instance when the funky twelve bar rhythm of The Levee's Gonna Break transitions into the stark, haunting, slow chords of Ain't Talkin', you almost get weak in the knees, and the hair really does stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />And Dylan sings,<br /><br />\\"Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />Up the road, around the bend.<br />Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />In the last outback at the world's end.\\"<br /><br />Who else but Dylan does stuff like this?<br /><br />Highly recommended.

I enjoyed her debut novel so much that I read the second half of it very slowly, so as to savor the uncanny occurrences and outrageously funny scenarios for as long as I could. White Teeth gave me a better history lesson on places like Jamaica, Pakistan, and England than any world history class I'd ever taken. But the seed of this novel is just the plain insanity of human nature.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|I've never been a Dylan fan.  But the last three CDs have really blown me away.   What he is doing is melding the whole core of American folk music into a series of songs that together, I would say, work extremely well.   And of course, he has the lyrics that transcend time and culture.   You get tragedy hit with comedy, and in the same line.   He is singing at the height of his power, too. <br /> <br />This is a great CD.   Oh, and for the record, there is no lounge music here.   Lounge music is strictly soft jazz, derived from the 50s.  There are some parlor songs, as there were on Love and Theft, but that's a completely different genre from lounge, though one could make the argument that some people adapted parlor into lounge....but it's pretty distant and really a weak argument.  Here, Dylan's referencing Stephen Foster, not Esquibel.  And  parlor goes back to Northern Europe, via Apalachia, mixed with African music, via Louisiana Creole.   No more lounge references are permitted! <br /> <br />At any rate, the band is crack.   I love those guys.  Never seen them, but the playing is a miracle.  Not one note out of place.   Nothing not needed.   I've recommended this to people who don't like Dylan, they think.   Made some converts.   Might make some more.  Never know.  We're just watching the river flow.

B000001Y16|5.0|This album is unbelievably untouchable.  You will never ever get tired of this album because the lyrics are so deep that you'll wonder why you listen to all the fake rappers today.  Tupac clearly exhibits his intelligence and amazing talent on this album.  Ratings of tracks: <br />1) Bomb First 9/10-   Excellent intro.  Tupac destroys his enemies lyrically with a killer beat.  I would be scared if I was Biggie!  This track would be a 10 but the Outlaw's weak talent weaken the song just a bit as usual. <br />2)Haily Mary 10/10 - One word:CLASSIC even if the outlaws don't complement pac well. <br />3) Toss it Up 7/10- Possibly the weakest song on the album.  If you want a good club song to listen to by Pac, listen to How Do You Want It. <br />4) To Live and Die in L.A. 8/10- Awesome dedication to L.A.  I like the lyrics but the background vocals and beat of the chorus keep me from giving this song a 10. <br />5)Blasphemy 10/10- Amazing song.  So many biblical allusions that   aren't readily understood.  Very deep song.  Its incredible that Pac came up with a song like this. <br />6)Life of an Outlaw 9/10-  Excellent song with an excellent beat.  I won't give it a 10 because of the Outlaws.  However, I love Napoleon's verse since it complement's Pac's style.   <br />7) Just like Daddy 8/10-  The Outlaws do a decent job in this one.  Pac shines as usual. <br />8) Krazy 10/10 - Amazing beat with amazing lyrics.  Very emotional song that will touch anyone who hears it.  Bad Azz does a great job in this song.  I can listen to this song all day. <br />9) White Man'z World 10/10- The socially and politically aware Pac is back and once again reaches the emotional depths of people's hearts.  Another classic. <br />10) Me and My Girlfriend 9/10- Excellent song with a very clever metaphor.  The background phrases of the woman were very annoying.  Still a great song. <br />11) Hold ya Head 10/10 - Excellent song that is underrated by many due to the widespread airtime of Keep YaHead Up.  This song is different because it addresses all people and not just black women. <br />12) Against All Odds 8/10- Biggie probably peed in his parents when he heard this one.  Another amazing assault on Pac's enemies.  Beat could have been better. <br />Overall:  Get this album.  You will never, ever get tired of it.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|First off, I have to admit that I never finished Silent Hill or Silent Hill 2 on the PS2 simply because it freaked me out too much.  I had decent hopes for the movie, no matter what the critics said.  Unfortunately, the critics were right.  The movie has its good and bad but sometimes the bad isn't so bad that the movie is ok.  This is different than going in w/ low expectations and being content with it.  This movie just doesn't do it for me.<br /><br />Scary and horror movies have many different ways of being effective.  Graphics can be scary, sure, but if they aren't backed up properly, it can be viewed as a joke or weird.  The concepts behind the horror has to be sound. If they can mess with your mind, even better.  Sometimes the action can be horrific.  Shock value doesn't go that far.<br /><br />Alien for example, was a good horror movie.  It wasn't necessarily the concept, but the atmosphere.<br /><br />Event Horizon had a creepy concept.  The concept of an evil, horrific force that can span across the galaxy had me creeped out more than the movie itself.<br /><br />Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw, etc.  It was all about the concepts.  Silent Hill doesn't do it conceptually or storywise.  Confusing, cryptic storylines work (Ju-On) but not in Silent Hill.  The basic story that Rose's daughter, Sharon, is a bit of a nutcase.  Rose believes that the only way to get her `fixed' is to visit the town of Silent Hill which Sharon tends to babble about in her sleep.  She also sleepwalks which really doesn't help matters much.  Sound enough premise, right?<br /><br />Nope.  By the time they get into a town that nobody wants to remember and strange things start happening, it SHOULD be time to pack up and go.  There wasn't really a sense of Rose being trapped (even though there were 2 scenes of the road being cut off) and all the viewer can think is, \\"Just leave.  The kid's a psycho.\\"  I don't agree with the director and writers showing the monsters off so early in the game.  The suspense disappeared very quickly in that regard.<br /><br />Due to the rather lame story, it's hard to feel for these characters.  I have no problem with using a female cast; I think it's great.  The connection between mother and daughter are there but it's not strong enough for us to want the mother to really find the daughter.  Because of both the early showing of monsters and the story, the REST of the monsters that are shown aren't scary.  Triangle head, creeping roach dude and the nurses, it just doesn't work.  Even the funky motions of the creatures can't save it.  House on Haunted Hill was creepier, y'know?<br /><br />The rest of the story, the whole witch hunt thing, was really lame.  Come on...  Survival horror is far more interesting than a contrived Hollywood-like story.  Demons?  ACTUAL demons???  Evil taking the form of a little girl that looks like a female Ju-On???<br /><br />The effects were ok.  The motion of the monsters sucked (probably because we've seen it too much now), but I loved the fog and falling ash effects.  The changing of Silent Hill world to HELL world was very cool.  The siren was ultra creepy.  All I can say in the end is that this movie would have done just fine w/o the Silent Hill name.  Sure, it's remotely based off the 1st game but the suspense and action just don't last long enough.  A casual viewer might be remotely entertained but any real fan of the games won't like it.

B000001F2X|5.0|The original vinyl take of this album was, at its time, one of the best sounding piece of plastic that I've ever listened to. And I'm talking both about music and the quality of the recording. It is one of Cale's musical turn points and somewhat a rupture from his early country/ ballad days although one can easily recognize his style. However this album features a premiere including one of the first Cale's attempts in instrumental improvisation (see \\"The Sensitive Kind\\"), which has been masterfully achieved in a more elaborated manner on album \\"Okie\\" (\\"Okie\\"). and more blues-like on album \\"Shades\\" (\\"Pack My Jack\\").<br /><br />Wonder if you should buy it ? Do it. You'll be more than pleased. The CD is a good remastered version of the LP and the analogic feel can be tested on \\"Boilin' Pot\\" (though the guitar doesn't sound exactly as on the vinyl version, I mean as best).
B000000I3O|5.0|This is not your Pop-Punk stuff. No sad little Emo kids are jamming to this one , either.<br /><br />They are everything punk should be- 3 chords, loud , fast , and indecihpherable at times.  However, The Misfits are still a unique experience blending 50's B Movie references with a Ted Bundy mentality and lyrics about Jackie Kennedy giving special favors.<br /><br />They have had several resurgences and line up changes but this collection is the real deal. It truly covers the spectrum of the band and is basically all A+ material.<br /><br />They are great for the teen angst phase of life and still always sound good in heavy traffic. A band that gets you moving in the morning.<br /><br />This album is the best possible way to reclaim a piece of your youth, fuel the fires of teen or middle age, or you can just drop it in to decipher the spooky lyrics. Great for the true fan or the novice.<br /><br />On a side note- I am always saddened by their lack of coverage in most punk documentaries and biographies.
B000001FK3|5.0|I have trouble deciding my favourite Cale's album but this one is a strong candidate for the first place (the other ones are \\"Okie\\" and \\"Shades\\" and, to some extent, his latest Live recordings).<br /><br />\\"Naturally\\" features the original \\"After Midnight\\" that many Clapton fans will recognize, though they are unaware of being Cale's composition. Actually few people know that Clapton himself declared that Cale's music was  like mentorship to him.<br /><br />This is a very misty album. Due to the recording, all tunes have a shadow of damping of the hi-key dynamics which make them more fit for the general atmosphere of the music. I've always wondered if it's not a trick of the recording engineer because the vinyl is exactly the same. The music is absolutely marvelous. I have it also on the vinyl but I order it on CD because I listen it VERY often. \\"Magnolia\\" and \\"After Midnight\\" are may favourites. Listening these tunes I feel the same as being awakened from a beautiful dream in a warm summer morning. Very mellow but not sweet, exactly as they should be. The cover of the CD says it all: it is like Alice in Wonderland.
B000001ESP|5.0|In 1981, Rush put out the best album they ever had in their career. Moving Pictures is very outstanding and musical. The big hit Tom Sawyer is their biggest hit or at least I think it is. Red Barchetta is about a fast car that a boy or guy had found in his relations barn and he goes for a ride in it and as you hear the song you can picture yourself in this car and driving it. It really gets your blood pumping. Limelight is also a good song that Peart, Lifeson and Lee had performed on. YYZ is very fine instrumental material. My friend and I used to listen to Witch Hunt and Vital Signs in the dark. WOW what a rush that was. Now I know why they called themselves Rush. All in all this is a very good CD that any Rush fan should have in their collection.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Get your decades right, pal. Beck is the white version of Prince. First came Prince in 1978, influenced from Rick James, James Brown, and P-Funk (in that order). Beck came almost 15 years later, influenced by Prince, Zappa, and a host of small-release art rockers (roughly in that order).<br /><br />Now to the album. Yes, this is the return of Prince at his very best. He's managed to take his old guitar funk sound and bring it completely up to date. \\"Black Sweat\\" is every bit as sexy and stylish as his best early 90's work (before he stopped using his name).<br /><br />I agree with other reviewer when they say that Prince isn't really \\"back in form\\". He really hasn't changed so much as pulled out all the stops, and it's good to see him really working again. \\"Musicology\\" was good, but this is an altogether stronger album. Whereas \\"Musicology\\" was a tribute to the roots of modern R&B and funk, this album is decidedly more informed by current hip-hop style than any of his previous work.
B000G1T3GU|4.0|Hard to believe but we've had 30 years of \\"More Than A Feeling\\" already!  And to commemorate this occasion, we now have a \\"remastered\\" mini-lp sleeve replica version of Boston's best album which should also rank among the best ever debut albums of the 70s as well.<br /><br />The packaging is a work of art as it very faithfully follows the original vinyl packaging down to the last detail but that's not where the fun stops; in addition to the insert with the lyrics in both English and Japanese, we also get 12-page colour booklet with very amusing liner notes written by none other than Tom Scholz himself!<br /><br />And now the not-so-good points: the album has been remastered but the sound quality is still not that great.  Many of the tracks sound pretty muddy and way below what you'd expect from remastered cds given today's technology.  Still, I've heard worse and I guess if you don't already have this and if you are a fan of mid-70s classic rock, this is probably the best version of the album that's out there right now.
B00005JOQT|5.0|\\"Superman Returns\\", the long-awaited NEW chapter of the Superman Saga, rewrites Superman's cinema history, occurring after the events of \\"Superman II\\" (III and IV have been thankfully discarded), and a 5-year absence of the Man of Steel, as he explored the remains of Krypton, searching for something tangible from his past. The film introduces Brandon Routh (1979- ) as the latest incarnation of Krypton's Last Son, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Christopher Reeve while in the Kent identity, and an aloof, almost Christ-like benevolence as Superman.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (\\"X-Men\\" I and II) wanted to create not only an original new chapter in the Saga, but a sincere homage to Richard Donner's definitive first \\"Superman\\", as well, digitally inserting clips of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, utilizing John Williams' famous theme (for the fifth time in the franchise), showing pictures of 'Pa Kent' Glenn Ford on the the Kent Farm's mantle, and repeating key dialog from the first film (Superman's well-known advice about flying brought laughter and applause from theater audiences). While \\"Superman II\\" and \\"Superman III\\" composer Ken Thorne, and \\"Superman IV\\" composer Alexander Courage (who wrote the original \\"Star Trek\\" TV theme), had been hamstrung, creatively, by being forced to simply 'adapt' John Williams' soaring music into the sequels' storylines (with decreasing success, in each film), frequent Singer composer John Ottman actually expanded upon Williams' vision, adding his own themes and motifs, creating a score even more vaulting, heroic, and spiritual.<br /><br />To those critics who would claim \\"Superman Returns\\" followed the first Superman film too slavishly, there was a major change, barely noticed when the film debuted; the 'take' on the Man of Steel's superpowers came from the mid-eighties' comic book revamp of the character...No longer did Kal-El come to Earth already possessing \\"Powers and Abilities Far Beyond Mortal Men\\"; he, instead, was a Kryptonian solar \\"battery\\", powered by Earth's yellow sun, who would not manifest his abilities until sufficiently 'charged' (which was why young Clark would be seen in the film wearing glasses; he actually needed them, as he was quite frail...as would any child be, of Kryptonian heritage...baby Kal-El could never have lifted Pa Kent's truck, saving his life, in this version!)<br /><br />Superman would soon find that things had changed dramatically in his absence. Lois Lane (portrayed by Kate Bosworth as much calmer and more level-headed than Margot Kidder, though incongruously younger-looking), feeling betrayed by his never having said goodbye, has won a Pulitzer Prize for her editorial \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\", now shares her life with Perry White's nephew, Richard (\\"X-Men\\" star James Marsden), and has a frail five-year-old son (portrayed by young Tristan Lake Leabu, who is a pivotal character in the plotline). Lex Luthor (a very engaging if sinister Kevin Spacey), long released from custody (since key witness Superman never appeared at his trial to testify), bilks an aged millionairess (legendary 'Lois Lane' Noel Neill) on her deathbed, and uses his new fortune to return to the Fortress of Solitude and steal the Krypton crystals in the 'ultimate' land scheme. The only friendly faces around are his stepmother, Martha Kent (the always wonderful Eva Marie Saint), Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), who, in a nostalgic scene, takes Clark to a bar run by Jack (TV's original 'Jimmy Olsen') Larson, and Perry White (played with rumpled charm and a twinkle in his eye, by Frank Langella).<br /><br />After a truly spectacular rescue sequence, involving a space shuttle, a disintegrating airplane, and a stadium full of people, Superman regains the public's confidence (another scene that brought cheers from the theater audience, the night I viewed the film)...but Lois would require far more time...and Luthor plans to kill billions, beginning with Superman.<br /><br />\\"Superman Returns\\" is a stunning, brilliantly conceived achievement, offering not only the expected (and superbly created) 'super heroics', but a deeply satisfying, uplifting 'morality tale', of life, death, and redemption, as well. Brandon Routh, while not as charismatic as Christopher Reeve, proves himself more than capable as the Man of Steel (although I DO prefer the old Superman uniform over the Speedo-inspired new look!)<br /><br />While I believe the first Christopher Reeve \\"Superman\\" movie is still the best film of the series, thus far, this newest production runs a very close second, in my opinion...<br /><br />With generally enthusiastic reviews, and a world-wide box office gross well over $350,000,000, there is definitely life in the Superman franchise, yet!\\"Superman Returns\\" is a stunning, brilliantly conceived achievement, offering not only the expected (and superbly created) 'super heroics', but a deeply satisfying, uplifting 'morality tale', of life, death, and redemption, as well.

B000002U94|5.0|I just got the CD delivered this morning.  I am listening to it right now and I am totally impressed.  I originally bought it for the #2 cut \\"Tryin' to Live My Life Without You\\" thinking the rest of it will be just OK.  WRONG.  I can't get over how great the whole CD turned out to be.  It comes highly recommended by this listener. Rock 'n Roll is alive and well on this CD!
0151008116|5.0|This is a fantastic book. It is one I think everyone should read. It also makes a great discussion/book club selection. <br /> <br />Life of Pi is the story of a Hindu/Christian/Islam boy whose father owns a zoo. They sell the zoo and plan on moving to Canada. While in route, their ship sinks and Pi ends up on a lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, and a Bengal tiger. The expected soon happens to the other animals and Pi is left alone with the tiger, named Richard Parker. The rest of the book focuses on how they survive-the ocean and each other. <br /> <br />The book is divided into three parts: Toronto and Pondicherry, The Pacific Ocean, and Tomatlan, Mexico. The first part I moved slowly for me, but it does add depth and understanding to the story. I'm glad I plugged through it. The second part is the most engaging-the story of how Pi survives Richard Parker and the ocean. I found the account of how Pi trained the tiger fascinating. Also, what Pi has to endure to survive is truly gut wrenching. The third part of the book is the most important. Everything you thought and believed is suddenly turned on its head. You will dwell on the last 30 pages for days, and be itching to talk with someone who has read the book.  <br /> <br />This book is so many things: funny, horrific, dramatic, touching, ridiculous, brilliant, light, and deep. Fantastic! <br />
0893860220|4.0|I'm not sure this guy deserves the title of \\"Sri\\".  I think of him more as a successful swami or guru.  He didn't get very far in the biz, and maybe he'd have gotten nowhere if somebody hadn't started tape recorded these question and answer sessions at his so called tenement in Bombay.  I've seen pictures of the tenement, and though the digs are not as high a quality as Rev Ike's, it's not quite a tenement either.   <br />After selling cigarettes all his life, Nisargadatta got around to enlightening who he could--and that was not many.  While most enlightened ones are calm, cool, and collected, Nisargadatta occasionally blows a fuse.  Sometimes you can't blame him for that as many of his so called disciples aren't exactly Harvard Business School material. <br />The discussions are entertaining and well worth reading if you ask me.  I'd give this book a higher rating, but I think you should throw in a little dogma into the mix, and Nisargadatta is minimalist on that, and he doesn't have too much to say about God either. <br />If you're somebody who's looking for a guru but looking to avoid too much God talk, I highly recommend Nisargadatta.  I don't much mind the God talk myself, but if you're looking to avoid it, you'll give this book 5 stars.   <br />Personally, I think he's a great guy, and if he were alive today, I'd most certainly make a trip to Bombay if I could get a back row seat and listen to this stuff.  It beats TV and most TV preachers, that's for sure.
0670033049|5.0|No other author shows you the human spirit during America's Great Depression era like John Steinbeck. Eden's characters are simply amazing; each possessing subconscious energies guiding them toward the turmoil and passions which ultimately shape their lives. The character of Lee affected me beyond my own realization, until I reached the very last chapter. I read this book, believing I had figured each character's fate, but found instead a continuous and renewed bewilderment as the tale unfolded.  <br /> <br />You won't be able to put it down!! <br />
B0006FFRVQ|3.0|I have several DVD-Audio and SACD discs.  On this one, the DVD-Audio tracks have no sound.  They show to be playing, but I get no audio from multichannel or stereo playback.  The Dolby Digital tracks play just fine, as do the music videos.  My player is a Pioneer DV-563A and I have never had this problem before.  Really a disappointment since I was so glad to see a Dualdisc with DVD-Audio content.    UPDATE:  Took the disc up to Best Buy and tried to play it on several DVD-Audio players.  The disc played fine on all of the Denon units, but refused to correctly play back on any Pioneer machine.    UPDATE 2: Pioneer has a firmware upgrade that resolves all playback issues with this disc, and their newer players don't have the issue mentioned above.
1405206691|3.0|The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig has been a favorite story in our household for many years.  We love it!  I can't recommend this story enough!!!!  The big bad pig is a tyrant and the wolves are such ingenious engineers, it makes the Big Bad Pig look even more formidable with his sledgehammer and dynamite. I recently purchased the pop-up version for a friend, but can honestly say I enjoyed reading the ordinary book more than the pop-up version.  The pop-ups were very distracting and I think it takes away the energy from the story and the reader becomes disengaged, trying to fiddle with all the contraptions.  I vote for the good old-fashioned book version any time!!
B000002L5I|1.0|The music wasn't bad, however the vocals are a MAJOR disappointment.  I kept expecting something better with each song.  Then I realized the problem; there was no raw feelings conveyed, no personality, no life.  You can't sing blues songs with a polished pop voice.

0452270073|5.0|\\"Remember, you must behave as becomes the hero I expect you to be.\\" <br /> <br /> In Regeneration, by Pat Barker, Dr. Rivers, a brilliant psychologist is given the task of \\"curing\\" the soldiers sent to his mental institute so they can return to service. Ironically, these mental problems are caused by their service in WWI. The story tells of a brilliant psychologist, Rivers, and his treatment of several patients, the most important of which is Siegfried Sassoon, the published War poet who was taken to the Craiglockart Mental Institution for his written protest against the War. Rivers is forced to treat Sassoon, who is not remotely insane, but possibly saner in recognizing the evil of the War, which is evident in all the patients he treats. Sassoon forces Rivers to come to terms with his own work and mission at Craiglockart. Rivers' analysis of Sassoon's attitude towards the War shows Rivers the futility of Sassoon's protest. By refusing to participate in the War, Sassoon is not only breaking the oath he took when he entered the service, but because he is not serving, he is similar to the leaders and generals prolonging the War from afar.  <br /> <br />Pat Barker expertly illustrates the horrors of the War through its victims. Regeneration is so blunt, open, and horrific that it forces us to square with the terror and outrage of this tragedy, and discover our real feelings on the conflict in the world today. WWI is the perfect setting for this dramatic anti-war book. The author uses the destructive weapons, real people, and extreme mental breakdowns to emphasize what these men went through. <br /> <br />There is a poem by Wilfred Owens, a character in the book and friend to Siegfried Sassoon, which mirrors the brutal horror and futility of the War.   <br /> <br />So Abram rose, and clave the wood, and went,  <br />And took the fire with him, and a knife. <br />And as they sojourned both of them together, <br />Isaac the first-born spake and said, My Father,  <br />Behold the preparations, fire and iron, <br />But where the lamb, for this burnt-offering? <br />Then Abram bound the youth with belts and straps,  <br />And builded parapets and trenches there,  <br />And stretched forth the knife to slay his son.  <br />When lo! an Angel called him out of heaven;  <br />Saying, Lay not thy hand upon the lad,  <br />Neither do anything to him, thy son.  <br />Behold! Caught in a thicket by its horns,  <br />A Ram. Offer the Ram of Pride instead. <br />But the old man would not so, but slew his son, <br />And half the seed of Europe, one by one. <br />
B000001ED1|3.0|This record mostly grates on me. Often Osborne is pushing and straining her voice, which is good for expression when used moderately, but a lot of the songs plug along at the same intensity for 5 minutes, and it is just tiring, even on a pretty good song like Right Hand Man.  <br /> <br />Lumina is also probably a fine song, but it sounds like a demo, with a poorly recorded vocal and a lone unadorned electric guitar. This composition never has a chance to get off the ground.  <br /> <br />Let's Just Get Naked also seems like it could be a fine song. Joan affects a different character in this vocal, evoking a ditzy, drugged-out groupie type of girl. But the tempo is too slow, the dynamics never change much, and the whole mess grinds on for five minutes without anything to break the monotony. <br /> <br />Man In The Long Black Coat is one of the few classic Dylan compositions of the last 20 or 30 years. Joan's version doesn't even begin to touch the creepiness of the original. Pointless. <br /> <br />The song that drew most people to this album, One of Us, is really a very amusing song, and raises some interesting questions. As the theme song to TV's Joan of Arcadia, I didn't even know Joan Osborne sang it -- she sings so sweetly, with none of the strain and grit in her voice that she so often uses. She sings it sweetly on this album version too. Obviously much care was taken in production to get this signature tune just right. I like it.  <br /> <br />This record shows potential, but her album Righteous Love was a greater success musically. The song Running Out Of Time from the Righteous Love CD is more exciting than anything on Relish. There is enough material here for a decent EP, but it could have been so much more. There isn't enough for a main course, just some relish on the side.
B000002J09|5.0|\\"Hey hey mama, said the way you move, Gonna make you sweat gonna mak you groove...\\" is the opening line to an epic album if there ever was one.  <br />I can not imagine how to sit down and write a song like a Led Zepplin song. To create a song with the charge of \\"Rock and Roll\\", or the lyrics to \\"Battle of Evermore\\", to create something like these epic songs is something that beyond me; and as for \\"Stairway\\" I think that's beyond any of us mortals. The popular \\"Stairway\\" had a seemingly unreal start when one day Robert Plant had a pencil and paper and Jimmy Page was just strumming when Plant described it as \\"my hand just started writing out the words. I just sat there and looked at them and almost leapt out of my seat.\\" The song has gone on to capture immortality in the music world and is the most frequently played song in American history, which is pretty good seeing how it was never released as an actual single. But it is not just a Zepplin CD with \\"stairway\\" on it. It is has so much to offer in every track.  <br />I have grown up with these songs, and if you've ever seen a Ford commercial or just listened to the radio, chances are that you have had these songs in your head one way or another even if you don't know who Led Zepplin is. But the one song that has always unrightfully gone in the shadows of \\"Stairway\\" is \\"When the Levee Breaks\\". I always personally found \\"Levee\\" as the strongest song in Zoso; but i dare not compare two songs of their caliber. But \\"Levee\\" brings this epic Album to an extraordinary close. After every listen, I find it hard to believe that there is only Eight tracks, because it sucks you into a world of enormous sound and mystery, and after you have listened to ZOSO whether it be the first time or if it's been too many to count, it leaves you with a sense that you have heard something special, done by a band with a sound that is larger than life.  <br /> <br />Essential Recording. No exceptions.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I purchased this because of the ads on TV and a local TV station who did a bit called \\"But, does it really do that?\\"  They said it did, but it really does not.  To give an upside, it is easy and quick to use and does work on carpet.  However, on my hardwood floors all it did was blow away the crumbs and dust so that I had to go over the area again and again at different angles.  Plus, if you accidentally turn it over all of the debris inside spills out all over the floor.  Last week I got so irritated with it that I threw it out the door over the deck and it crashed in the yard in pieces and that really did feel good!!
B00005JP4U|5.0|99 out of 100 scientists who studied global warming have NO doubt it is occurring, speeding up and largely caused by human activities. The few remaining doubters are usually paid by the Oil/Energy lobby or known to clamour for publicity by causing controversy rather than bothering with the facts. The only way to stop this issue from being distorted and misrepresented until it is too late (which it may already be, we are definitely at the brink of no return) is to beat the polluters by their own game - scream as loud and as much as you can and keep repeating the (inconvenient) truth over and over and over. At least it's the truth, as opposed to most other codswallop that is shoved down our throats by the pundits.  <br /> <br />This movie (and book) is a great way to bring the message to the masses. I never much liked Al Gore but on this topic he is a true hero. Heed the call, spread the word, make everyone you know watch it, lobby your schools to show it to the kids, don't get drawn into meaningless arguments with non-informed dimwits and bought naysayers. Just give them the DVD/book and then argue about how you can fix it.  <br /> <br />This really isn't a topic where we can wait and see and keep collecting data until every angle is proven 100% fact (which is impossible in natural science). I rather be proven wrong but doing everything to avert disaster now than proven right when I find myself 6 feet under water!
B000002BPS|5.0|Each Offspring album is a bit different in its own small way. Although, this is the one probably most like their breakthrough masterpiece Smash. If you enjoyed Smash a lot, like I did, then this should be the next in line for you to try out. Not saying that their newer stuff is somehow not as good, they just have a slightly different sound that the earlier two. This follow up just shows how The Offspring are keeping their punk rock style sound strong with each release. It's also a really good follow up album. My favorite tracks are probably \\"Gone Away\\", \\"I Choose\\", \\"Amazed\\", and \\"Me & My Old Lady\\". Here's everything else rated...<br /><br />2. The Meaning Of Life - 9.5/10<br />3. Mota - 9/10<br />4. Me & My Old Lady - 10/10<br />5. Cool To Hate - 10/10<br />6. Leave It Behind - 8.5/10<br />7. Gone Away - 10/10<br />8. I Choose - 10/10<br />10. All I Want - 9/10<br />11.

Change The World - 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 93% A-<br /><br />It's just another solid release from The Offspring. If you enjoyed Smash you will probably enjoy this as well. It's just another good release by a pretty awesome punk rock band.
B00005JOYM|4.0|MOVIE: \\"It's too soon! Too soon!\\" Those have been the outcries from almost everybody about Oliver Stone's World Trade Center. It was accussed of trying to exploit the event of profits, and basically people were just being people and were just speaking off the tip of their tongues. Well, the movie was really good. It's what you would expect from a historical picture, unfortunetly for us this event is pretty recent in our history. We watch WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan, Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now, and all other war movies and the difference is that most people did not experience it first hand. Everyone here in the United States watched the towers fall, live, on their televisons. We watched them replay the footage over and over. So, a film of this nature is not too soon, it just has to be handled carefully. Oliver Stone made a great film, a film that celebrated the courage and will to survive rather than the actual terror of the situation. United 93 was a raw and very frightening experience, unlike this film. The only problem with the film is that in telling the tale you'll have to resort to old fashioned cliches. We know what happens at the end, and the story itself is no different than any other survival story. Just the fact that these people experienced it 5 years ago makes the difference and makes it unique. This movie is more of a tribute film rather than a piece of entertainment, no extraordinary cinematography or score, just a heartfelt and emotional story.<br /><br />ACTING: Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena display some fine acting as they take on the roles of two port authority police officers trapped in the rubble. It's hard to convey raw emotion when for the majority of the film has you trapped under concrete, but they really get in the state of mind. The acting is very excellent.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A decent tribute that unfortunetly just doesn't exceed as a film.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|In the reviews for the HP 12c Platinum, one reviewer commented on many things.  ALL BUT ONE are fixed in the new HP 12c Platinum 25th Anniversary calculator.<br /><br />The one thing:  The display \\"flash\\" when you input a figure into a financial register.  I miss that.  Probably the ONLY reason I'll keep my HP 12c \\"gold\\".  That helps to \\"know\\" that the number was input into that register.<br /><br />It doesn't \\"wobble\\" on the desk (unlike my \\"gold).  You can see the orange/red text on the BLACK background (versus the silver).  When you shake the calculator, the keys don't rattle as well (versus the gold).  Oh, and I prefer the \\"matte\\" plastic keys over the somewhat shinier keys of the gold.<br /><br />It's a great looking calculator.  REAL black with nice-looking silver accents.  It's got a nice \\"Star Wars\\" look.<br /><br />What I don't understand is why the different case?  This new case is not slim and not able to fit into certain pockets of my briefcase.  And what's up with the clear ID pocket on the back side of it?  I know the 12c was originally touted as a \\"financial powerhouse in a pocket-size unit\\", but I don't think people actually carry them in their pockets???  Purses and briefcases, sure, but it's not a substitute wallet.  It's a good thing I still have the case to my \\"gold\\".  It's a better fit.<br /><br />At least HP seems to be committed to good product research and the input of their product reviewers.<br /><br />BTW, those extra 10 \\"functions\\" over the Gold must be the way to calculate things using ALGEBRAIC notation versus RPN; because I don't see any real differences between the functionality of either calculator.<br /><br />*****UPDATE 08/03/2007*****<br /><br />Since I reviewed the Platinum Anniversary edition of the HP 12c, I had acquired a \\"classic\\" HP12c made in 1984 made in USA.  In comparison to the \\"Made in USA\\" 12c, the anniversary one feels cheaper somehow.  The keys sound hollow compared to the tank of the older 12c.  The slightest touch to the USA-12c will turn on the calculator, while the same touch to the Anniversary 12c is spotty at best.  The display on the Anniversary 12c has a \\"greener\\" tint to it compared to the original.  And I STILL love seeing the display \\"flash\\" with each input.  The keys are \\"injection molded\\", but my USA-12c keys were actually HP15c keys painted over for the 12c.

020530902X|4.0|In 1998, while attempting to learn the writing craft, I received this little book as a gift. I found it useful, both as a refresher, and for the many examples of the conventions that underlie good grammar.<br />I've since acquired and read other texts on the subject, but The Elements of Style is still in the bookstand on my desk and I use it as my \\"go to\\" source - exactly as the authors intended. If you know someone who's writing, why not do them the same favor my friend did me?<br />Art Tirrell - author of The Secret Ever Keeps, coming Spring 2007 ISBN 978-1-60164-004-8.
0743454537|3.0|This book reminded me strongly of Alice Hoffman's \\"At Risk\\" about a terminally ill preteen girl with cancer. But unlike the Hoffman book, the metaphors and the whimsy here was too forced to work and the subplots strongly detracted from the central story of the girl and her family. <br /> <br />The technique of having six or so narrators also weakened the book. If it is going to be effective, in my view, the viewpoints have to alternate in a consistent pattern or have everyone get their own prolonged section (as opposed to just a few pages here and there). No one really needed to know about the lawyer's ex-prep school girlfriend's inner life, especially as she barely did anything to contribute to the trial scenes. The son also seemed like an afterthought. As a writer myself, I know how tempting it is to bounce from viewpoint to viewpoint rather than staying on course and struggling to make just one the centerpoint. But the ADD approach just makes the narrative flow scattered. Adding different fonts to cue the reader in as to a change in narration is something a young person would do, in my opinion. <br /> <br />The story itself, as over 600 reviewers have mentioned is about a preteen who decides to sue her parents so she can decide whether or not to donate a kidney to her sister. Or that's the reason she gives at the start. On the way there, there are a lot more hugs and kisses and understandings of the opposing side's feelings than there would be in real life. This book would make an outstanding Lifetime movie. During the scene where the mom and the two daughters shave their head, I could just see them bopping around the kitchen to the strains of \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough.\\" That's not necessarily a bad thing. Some books are just beg to be adapted for the screen (see The Devil Wears Prada). <br /> <br />Oh, and the terminally ill girl is called Kate. Has anyone ever noticed that all young characters called Kate seem to have an identical personality type: spunky,plucky, slightly sarcastic, etc.? (Recent example; History Lesson for Girls.) I've never met a Kate in literature that was passive and shy and dreamy. Do authors do this on purpose? <br /> <br />At the end, the characters start behaving in ways totally inconsistent with how they've been portrayed for the majority of the book, in fact, things get really Hollywoodish. If you are the kind of reader that can swallow a wholesale personality change for drama's sake at the last minute, you will love this book. If you want a novel with a radically different and much less sensational approach to the ethics of organ donation, try \\"Never Let Me Go\\" by Kazuo Ishiguro. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001IPL|5.0|The Offspring has always been a fairly unique band. Even today they still are able to produce good sounding punk style music even with all of the mainstream radio and emo punk taking over the airwaves. Back then, in 1994, Instead of going up against bands like Nickelback or Fall Out Boy they were up against Alice n' Chains and Nirvana and still managed to sell a great deal of albums. Smash is probably the best album they have ever put out. The overall sound of everything on the album is just great. It's its own masterpiece. Just one big energetic, angsty, skate punk attitude album. I love the whole thing. Although, my favorite tracks would have to be \\"Gotta Get Away\\", \\"Come Out and Play\\", \\"Self Esteem\\", and \\"Smash\\". Pretty much everythings amazing though. Here's what I think of each track...<br /><br />2. Nitro (Youth Energy) - 10/10<br /><br />3. Bad Habit - 10/10<br /><br />4. Gotta Get Away - 10/10<br /><br />5. Genocide - 10/10<br /><br />6. Something To Believe In - 9.5/10<br /><br />7. Come Out And Play - 10/10<br /><br />8. Self Esteem - 10/10<br /><br />9. It'll Be A Long Time - 10/10<br /><br />10. Killboy Powerhead - 10/10<br /><br />11. What Happened To You? - 10/10<br /><br />12. So Alone - 9.5/10<br /><br />13. Not The One - 10/10<br /><br />14. Smash - 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 99% A<br /><br />Seriously, every track on this album is likeable. It's an exceptional release of the 90s that even if you have just heard or do like some of these songs should probably own the album. It's just a really good listen all the way through with many tracks that have also made it to radio.
B00005JP5J|5.0|MOVIE: There has been a lot of garbage out in the theaters so far this year. The only movies I can list that I truly found to be great were United 93, DaVinci Code, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, and now Little Miss Sunshine. This is one of the best films of the year, and the first movie that deserves some attention from Oscar voters. The story is about a family who takes a road trip to enter their daughter into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. We start the story and our ensamble cast is introduced one by one. We have Richard the overcontroling father, Sheryl the loving mother, their foul mouthed grandpa, the rebel son, Frank the suicidal homosexual genius uncle, and little Olive. I could spend a long time just describing the brilliance of each character and what they all mean to the plot, but that would take awhile. So, now this dysfunctional family goes on a roadtrip to California so that their daughter can enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. What follows is a heartwarming, emotional, and hilarious journey. Each character finds their own personal journey through Olive. Olive is the center of the film that holds the family together. The film isn't called Little Miss Sunshine beacause of the beauty pageant, it's because of Olive. This sweet innocent girl has no idea of the world around her, and no idea that she is the center of the family. A great scene in the film has Dwayne, the rebel son, refusing to get off the side of the road and continue with the trip even though everyone else is trying to comfort him into getting back in the car. Then his sister comes and rests her hand on his shoulder, he looks up at her, gets up and carries her back to the car. The film addresses many of life's problems and basically shows how it's all one big beauty pageant, but of course beauty doesn't matter at all. The only complaint I had about the film, which constitutes it's 3.5 stars, was the ending. I can't really say anything without ruining it, but let's just say it left a lot to be desired. I felt like the story deserved a more complete resolution versus what we were given.<br /><br />ACTING: The film is filled with an incredible cast, and I mean incredible. Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, and Abigail Breslin all give outstanding performances. Steve Carell is an amazing actor and I really feel like he's going to get nominated for his role here. The film is truly something special and the script definately calls for an ensamble, which they deliver.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Right now I am calling nominations for Steve Carell and Michael Arndt's amazing screenplay. Who new that this first time screenwriter would produce such a rich script. You also have to acknowledge the superb directing from real life married couple, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. We may just be looking at the Best Picture of the year, what a suprise if it did go on to win.just say it left a lot to be desired.

B00005JP87|4.0|I admit, I am very partial to period pieces.  So, when I saw an ad on the Internet for the illusionist, I said, this is my kind of movie.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed at all.  The Illusionist is about a 19th-century practitioner of the art of illusion, whose name is Eisenheim, played by Edward Norton (the guy behind the mask in Kingdom of Heaven.)<br /><br />His love interest in this atmospheric romantic drama is played by Jessica Biel (7th Heaven), and she is quite good in a role here.<br /><br />This is also the first role that I had actually liked Paul Giamatti in.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell once again plays royalty gone bad quite capably.<br /><br />So in conclusion, if you like atmospheric romantic drama, or magic and illusion, or perhaps something to remind you of the life of  A Conan Doyle, see this movie.  I don't think you will be disappointed.<br /><br />I feel The Illusionist DVD is one of the best releases of 2006.  If you like period movies, and you like magic, then you will like the illusionist.<br /><br />If you like movies about the 19th century, you also like The Illusionist.  With Prague Czechoslovakia doubling for Vienna.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is that was produced independently on a relatively limited budget in 45 days.  The commentary on the DVD explains how the magic tricks were done.  Although, it doesn't take you through them step-by-step.<br /><br />The cast is fine Edward Norton, and Jessica Biel do a fine job with the roles.  Paul Giamatti is also great.  The DVD commentary reveals that Jessica Biel had to campaign for even an audition to get the role of Sophie, because the producers felt that she looked too modern.<br /><br />This film will be compared to The Prestige because they are both movies about magic, and meet and magicians.  However I feel that The Illusionist, is a much better movie, because it had a much smaller budget to work with, and more constraints on its time.<br /><br />So I say, get The Illusionist DVD, and The Prestige DVD when it becomes available, and judge for yourself.  If you like magic you can go wrong.like magic you can go wrong.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I didn't think it could get any better than the first but this is a great album.  The more you listen to it the better it gets. I am proud to be a transplanted Mainer as Ray is.  Way to go Ray.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Make no mistake, this album is nothing short than amazing.  It is a haunting and atmospheric blend of southern country and blues. It transports you to another place and time.  Listening to this album makes you feel like you are in Mississippi in about 1945 in a motel lobby with ceiling fans and a great band performing. Dylan's writing and performance is unsurpassed on this latest effort. The track \\"Aint Talking\\" is an eerie and haunting song that bleeds anguish and torment. In 1997 Dylan delivered to us the morose \\"Time out of Mind\\" and in 2001 He followed up with \\"Love and Theft\\". I believe that this is Bob's second wave of classic albums followed only by his milestones from the 1960's. This is (In my opinion) Dylan's best album since \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and is probably in his top five best albums. This will always be one of Bob Dylan's milestones and it is well worth the wait. Bob Dylan is still the man!!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|The Offspring has so far yet to put out an album that really disappoints me. I haven't heard Ignition so I can't really say much about that but I have heard everything they've released since Smash and most are at least good. This release however is better than good, its very good. No it may not be as amazing as Smash but it does have a lot of great tracks. My favorites are \\"Staring at the Sun\\", \\"The Kids aren't alright\\", \\"She's Got Issues\\", and \\"Pay The Man\\". Here's ratings for the rest of the album... <br /> <br />2. Have You Ever - 9/10 <br />3. Staring At The Sun - 10/10  <br />4. Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) - 10/10 <br />5. The Kids Aren't Alright - 10/10 <br />6. Feelings - 9.5/10 <br />7. She's Got Issues - 10/10  <br />8. Walla Walla - 8/10 <br />9. The End Of The Line - 9/10  <br />10. No Brakes - 7.5/10 <br />11. Why Don't You Get A Job? - 9.5/10  <br />12. Americana - 8.5/10 <br />13. Pay The Man - 10/10  <br /> <br />Overall: 92% A- <br /> <br />Overall, It isn't the best by the band but it still is an accomplished release. I'm a big fan of this band but from what I've seen it may not please some of the fans who enjoy their earlier stuff like Smash. I think Smash is their best but I do enjoy their newer stuff as well even though its just slightly different in sound. I guess that slight change is enough to tick people off. Anyway, get this if your a fan of some of the tracks or just the band itself.
0553801503|2.0|This book was a lesson in what good writers do wrong.  Before this tome there hadn't been anything I'd read by George R R Martin that I hadn't liked.  This book, however, I didn't like.  It took several aerial rides across the room - a reader frustration outlet I like to use.<br /><br />Three very long books leading to this one had me hooked into the lives of the main characters, good and evil.  He wove a tale that had me believing that good characters did bad things and the most corrupted could find redemption in good actions.  Then he threw that all out the window and marched along on a new pace - one of inaction, tensionless drolling, and monotonous diaries.  All this while ignoring the characters we most wanted to hear about.<br /><br />I wanted to know about Bran Stark, the crippled boy on a mission.  I wanted to learn of Jon Snow, the bastard son forging a position of leadership and diplomacy in the North.  I wanted to learn of Tyrion Lannister, the imp, the dwarf who killed his father and terrifies everyone who knows him ally or enemy.  These are characters not even touched in this story.<br /><br />Martin needs an editor who'll bravely tell him to cut and cut and cut and cut . . . one that will strengthen the story instead of lengthening it.

0553381407|1.0|As someone who has a toxic mother, you know how everyday feels like an eternity when you feel so much pain inside.  Half of the book is about other people's experiences with her in therapy and the other half is about how we can change our situation ourselves.  I gave her 1 star because of this very important point that she misses:  If you have a truly toxic parent, confrontation is not the answer (as she says).  I agree with the other reviewer who gave one star because it doesn't seem like she has truly been in this kind of a situation.  The REALITY of LIVING WITH TOXIC PARENTS is that THEY DO NOT CHANGE.  I am a grounded and fair minded person, but I think her advice is baloney.  And she spent chapters on bits of advice that you could outline on one page.  I felt so bad after reading it.  Thanks for letting me share my thoughts with all of you.
B000FS9FCG|3.0|A man strolls the streets of London at night, a white mask upon his face and a chest strapped with bombs. He is Great Britain's last hope against a tyranny that has smoothily eased its way into the lives of England's citizens.<br /><br />Of course, revolution is forthcoming, thanks to the acts of our masked hero and his unlikely apprentice. But what about the political bone that is humerously picked throughout the film? Didn't see that one coming, eh?<br /><br />Our persecuted consist of anyone who is not standard, particularly homosexuals and Muslims. And wouldn't you know it, the persecuters are \\"deeply religios\\" individuals led by their Adolph Hitler lookalike leader.<br /><br />Smell an agenda? Oooooh, but it smells oh so sweet. I have to admit, I laughed at these contrived segments of martyr-mentality propaganda. Islam is under attack. Gays are under attack. I'm sorry, but I don't see this happening in the future. Call me naive, but the world seems quite cozy with both of these groups.  Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and Europe is currently leading the world into the new gay-friendly political scope.<br /><br />I think the overall premise of the film could be a distinct possibility, but the persecuted will be different when that day does arrives. The secondary underlying message of the film is that we should be weary of those who have an anti-gay, anti-Islam agenda. Which religious group could they be referring to exactly? hmmmmmmm...
B00005JNQA|4.0|I think in many directors' hands, \\"The Interpreter\\" would be run-of-the-mill stuff.  Thankfully, Sydney Pollack isn't run-of-the-mill quality.  He's crafted a really suspenseful and - in my mind - realistic thriller that keeps you fully engaged throughout the entire film.  [And, I might add, Pollack - as usual - acts here as well and he's as engaging on camera as he is talented behind it.]<br /><br />Now, I've never been a big Nicole Kidman fan (\\"To Die For\\" aside), and the coquettish whisper in which she delivers every line in this film is certainly distracting. Thankfully, Pollack gets solid performances from Catherine Keener, Sean Pean, George Harris (on a roll after \\"Layer Cake\\") and the Danish actor Jesper Christensen.  Christensen, in particular, makes the film in my estimation.  Is he a good guy or a bad guy, you're never quite sure.  [In fact, in the 'Deleted Scenes' on the DVD, you can see Pollack stripped out a couple of scenes that give away some of Christensen's character and motivations too early.  That's a master touch because the end product keeps you guessing without losing any of the narrative drive.]<br /><br />At the heart of tale woven by Pollack is the story of African dictator 'Zuwanie,' as portrayed by the regal (and then-88-year-old!!) Earl Cameron, a dictator in the Mobutu mold (colonial liberator slowly morphing to repressive, gun-toting dictator).  Will he be killed on an upcoming trip to the UN (as Kidman's character has overheard) or will a staged and failed assassination attempt consolidate and strengthen his hand back home (as Harris' 'Kuman-Kuman' suggests)?  Again, Pollack's editing is what keeps the balls in the air on this question and it'll keep you hooked until the end.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I was blown away by this film. It's so powerful and full of raw emotions that I can't shake it even several days later. I like it better and better. <br /> <br />The story develops slowly and I started out thinking that the characters were pretty unsympathetic, but all of a sudden I was 110% emotionally invested in the story which then seemed so much more powerful exactly because no idealisation had been done. <br /> <br />The film is tricky to read in several places and the ambiguity and the unsaid speak louder than the dialog. The attention you can feel has been paid to minute details forces you to pay attention and think both while and after you've seen the it. There's a lot to admire and notice, even on subsequent viewings. <br /> <br />Outstanding camera work and scenery, jaw dropping performances and a truly complex yet gripping story line.
0307277674|5.0|I have never actually read a book from back to front, but my sister advised me to read this one and stick with it. I did this and was totally amazed how it gripped me. I could not put the book down, which at times cause a little friction in the household as everything was put on hold until i finished it. Having finished the book it inspired me to read on and i have since purchased other Dan Brown titles which i am currently fighting to read. I am not a religious person but still found this book very interesting and i think this was mainly to do with the non stop twists which seemes to be on every page.<br /><br />I recommend anyone to read this book..!!<br /><br />J.P.
1592400876|5.0|While other grammar books have made me yawn in the past, this one actually gave me several \\"laugh out loud\\" moments. If you cringe at poorly punctuated text, you have found a comrade in Lynne Truss. If poor writing doesn't bother you at all (but you know you need to brush up on good grammar), then you'll love this book, too. The title alone lets you know that the entire book is funny.<br /><br />From noting that a person who used too many semi colons needed to have a \\"semi-colonic irrigation,\\" to describing the differences between British punctuation (which Lynne uses) and American (because she knew Americans would buy the book), this is one grammar book you will finish reading.<br /><br />Lynne Truss states, \\"...despair was the initial impetus for this book. I saw a sign for 'Book's' with an apostrophe in it, and something deep inside me snapped....\\"  She also writes about \\"people who don't know the difference between who's and whose, and whose bloody automatic 'grammar checker' can't tell the difference either.\\"<br /><br />I'm telling you: it's a good, funny read.

1567184855|5.0|This book does more than any other book I have read to ensure peace of mind for those contemplating their own death or the death of a loved one. It gives detailed histories of soul progress from the time of death up to the choice of the next birth. The detail is convincing, and it fits with my extensive study of metaphysical literature on spiritual development and reincarnation. The stories carry more credibility because they come from a skeptical hypnotherapist who got into regression therapy to help people with behavior problems, and developed techniques for regressing the client to the cause of the problem. At first he was getting mainly childhood events, then he got a case involving a past life. In following his own curiosity, he learned to take clients through their death scene and into the various phases of life between lives. Thus far I have bought about 8 copies to share with friends, and have told many more about it. Don't miss it! <br />SS Front Royal, Va.
B000CBSHK2|5.0|Really puzzled by so many bad reviews of this great batch of <br />songs.  My expectations were so low, and these songs are so <br />incredibly likeable.  And the \\"bad sound\\" is really just a very <br />nice, very informal, very fresh recording.  I'm not even a fan <br />of Beth Orton's, and I think this is just one of the most <br />wonderful and rewarding efforts I've heard in years.
B000002UAU|5.0|I feel like a monumental jackass reviewing this album:  should I review the Q'uran and Coka Cola Classic next?  Is there any more fundamentally unassailable album in the history of music?  Is anything more impervious to criticism?<br /><br />I just feel like recording the joy [I am not exagerating] I'm feeling right now as my 11-year-old daughter is discovering this album.  She is spurning Christina Aguilera and I don't know what other one-dimensional rot for the complex, multi-layered, polyphonic wonders of the peak album of the most musical foursome of all time.  This feels like a great victory for me.  Parenthood hath its rewards.<br /><br />Just had to type that out.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|\\"I'm in a cowboy band,\\" goes one of the lyrics on this most interesting of albums. This is a cowboy band album, a la Bob Wills, albeit fused with Dylan's quirky lyricism. It's a mix of boogie/shuffle/railroad blues with some drum-brushed, waltzy lilts that cry out for a megaphone and ukelele. It's a little early to tell if there are any masterpieces on it; certainly nothing approaching \\"Things Have Changed\\" or \\"Love Sick\\" from the recent past. There are some missed opportunities for signature guitar solos, though the early 60's guitar punctuation is enjoyable and refreshing.  The opening track, \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" is probably the best rocker, and \\"Nettie Moore\\" the most soulful. I'd like to be drunk in some roadhouse, punching these tunes up on the jukebox.
B000GPIPSS|4.0|The first thing to remember here is that this film was made in 1931. We've all become spoiled with restorations from the 40s and 50s showing more noticeable improvements. But consider what advances were made in film from the 30s to the 40s, and then from the 40s to the 50s when CinemaScope was introduced. It therefore only becomes easier to improve those older films that benefitted from better technology at the time. Being 75, \\"Dracula\\" is at an automatic disadvantage. There's only so much you can do.<br /><br />As for what Universal was able to accomplish with the 75th Anniversary DVD, I was very pleased on a couple fronts. First, the picture is crisp and clear. No distortions or no smudgy frames. That's a HUGE improvement over the Legacy release a few years ago and worth the price alone. Second, they reinstated the film to its original form, including all those moans and screams other reviewers have already mentioned before me. I'm not so interested in those moans and screams by themselves as I am in simply leaving the film-- especially a landmark classic such as this-- as it was filmed 75 years ago.<br /><br />My one complaint is the sound, again, as others have said. The ubiquitous hiss is not a big deal. Rather, it's the sometimes muffled words that are an annoyance. Better than the first Legacy DVD, but still not as clear as the original DVD release from the mid-90s. Like I said, there's only so much you can do with a film that's this old, but the back-and-forth sound quality we've seen from three releases is evidence enough that perhaps they still didn't tinker with it enough.
B0009A40ES|5.0|This has to be one of the best book to movie transfers I've ever seen. The screenwriter managed to capture all the horror, insanity, confusion and greed of the book, while still keeping the movie interesting. Much of the movie dialogue is straight from the pages of the book.<br /><br />Christian Bale pulls off the character of Patrick Bateman impeccably. He is completely empty and devoid of emotion, though trying to... fit... in...<br /><br />The scene where Bateman confesses all his crimes over the phone is where you truly get to see the brilliance of Christian Bale and why he's risen to the star status he has today.<br /><br />For this movie to be a low-budget film is even more amazing, and shows that it's not money that makes a movie great, but acting, directing, and a good script.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie, as you will miss out on a lot of the deeper meanings of certain situations or Bateman's inner monologues, but it's not necessary. Think of the movie as the abridged version of the book.
B000GRU6XS|5.0|Well, this is definitely not an \\"easy\\" Maiden album, like The Number of the Beast or, more properly, Brave New World. But, on the other hand, it is rich in experimentalism (for a pure metal album) and subtileness. You won't like it in the first time you play it, but in the 5th or 6th, you'll get caught. <br />Despite of what the band members said themselves, this can be considered, in my point of view, a concept album, just like 7th Son of a 7th Son - the concept being, as the title says, life and death (and, logically, war - mother of the last one). <br />This album reminds me, as well, the X-Factor one, with its VERY dark and heavy atmosphere. But the songs, taken individually, relate, one way or another, to classic Maiden tunes -  except for, I'd say, The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg and Lord of Light, brand new ideas. <br />Different World is a true Adrian song; <br />These Colours Don't Run, strange as it could be, reminds me of The Assassin, of the No Prayer for the Dying album; <br />Brighter than a Thousand Suns has all the elements of a classic: great lyrics, slow parts interpolated with grinding riffs and solos, performance. Reminds me some song I just can't recall;  <br />The Pilgrim has an eastern mood with a very Mother Russia-like riff; <br />Longest Day could be in the X-Factor; <br />Out of the Shadows is sort of a heavier Wasting Love; <br />Reincarnation is fresh, very good song; <br />For the Greater Good of God is Fear of the Dark revisited; <br />Lord of Light is the heaviest track of the album and, probably, one of the best Maiden songs ever; <br />The Legacy is like Sign of the Cross and, as this one, asks for a full orchestra and choir. Great tune. <br />Definitely, the last 3 years weren't in vain. Maiden worked hard and well. Enjoy.
B000G759LW|5.0|So,  I only listened to music by Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Bjork. But, I enjoy Christina Aguilera's music. I recieved Stripped as a joke present (because I just never listened to that much pop music) heard it, and liked it, thought it was ok.... but then left it alone. Now, I'm listening to Back to Basics, and I'm in love. Every song is great. I love the concept, I love how she split it into two discs. Its making me go back and listen to Stripped. So, I don't know that if in my age I'm finally opening up to fun music, or she's just really that breathtaking. I do think that this could open her up to a whole slew of new fans though.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This CD is forgettable, except for \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Brave New Girl\\", but still, a CD with 2 'Ok' songs doesn't make a good CD.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|The Wachowski brothers screen adaptation of the comic book cum graphic novel is masterful. The film's longer title should be \\"'The Phantom of the Opera' meets '1984' meets 'The Count of Monte Cristo'meets 'Point Blank'\\", since many elements from those marvelous stories/films are contained therein; e.g., revenge, political ideas/comment, action, humor, and (yes) a little romance. But don't read too much into it...accept it as riveting entertainment.
0684824906|5.0|Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Dorris Kearns Goodwin, does it again.  Just when one thinks that there is virtually nothing more to be said about Lincoln, she proves us wrong.<br /><br />This book is not so much a biography, far more a character study of a team of cabinet members and their unequaled President, who not only oversaw them all, but of all persons in history, had probably the most perfect character disposition to see the country through it's darkest days.<br /><br />While Washington still looms large as the \\"father of the country\\", Lincoln is the peerless leader who saw the country on the brink of death, and revived it, giving it new life.  He managed people with the skill of a master neurosurgeon.  To this day, he reminds us to act from the \\"better angels of our nature.\\"  Ms. Goodwin adeptly shows how Lincoln, more than any other leader before or since, lived that ideal.<br /><br />Perhaps even unintentionally, Ms. Goodwin's book shows how character matters in trying times more than any other.  I, for one, am very gratefull to her for giving the world this wonderful work.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Most songs created for commercial purposes are in the two to three minute range. The first thing I noticed on \\"Modern Times\\" is that not a single song is in this range. They are all long. Once again, the quality of the music and the band here is outstanding. The album starts off with the rock number \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" with a great beat, interesting lyrics and Dylan doin' pretty well on vocals. I really like the guitar work. \\"Spirit on the Water\\" is a mellow, upbeat number with a country feel and nice melody. \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" is a bluesy rock song and cooks. This album is on par with \\"Love and Theft\\" and \\"Time Out of Mind\\" with the three seeming like a trilogy. The steel guitars kick off \\"When the Deal Goes Down\\" and Dylan's voice almost seems like a \\"Lay, Lady, Lay\\" copy. Very nice song! Another driven rock tune in \\"Someday Baby\\". It appears that Dylan is having a lot of fun on this record. I really like the piano intro on \\"Workingman's Blues # 2\\". Here Dylan seems to be in a bar talking to us. \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" has the steel guitar and that Nashville Skyline feel. Some think \\"Nettie Moore\\" is the best song on \\"Modern Times\\" although my favorite is the opening track. \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" is a blues number making me wonder if Katrina was in Bob's thoughts. This is my second favorite song on the record. I really like the guitar solo. \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" with it's minor key and violins makes this quite different than the other songs on \\"Modern Times\\". This album is excellent and is quite an addition to his life's work.
1573228737|5.0|I don't quite know where to begin to review this novel. First, although I haven't read all the reviews so there may be a mention of it in one of them I missed, I was surprised that not more connections were drawn to Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story - \\"The Yellow Wallpaper.\\" It is one of my favorite stories and I saw so many allusions and interesting ties to that story. I also found the novel to be slightly reminiscent of Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace - especially in terms of questions of guilt and the seduction of one character by another - though the seduction in Alias Grace is less sexually based.  <br /> <br />The more important thing to discuss here however is that Sarah Waters is an excellent and talented writer. She brought this dark and complex story to life with such grace and subtlety. I was so impressed by her ability to bring the reader so closely into Margaret Prior's mind and experience without making her seem an extreme or unrelatable character. I found myself sympathisizing with her, worrying with her, rejoicing with her, and understanding the various emotional twists and turns she went through as if I was experiencing it for myself. <br />I was also so impressed with the way that she handled both Margaret's and the readers doubts or uncertainty about spiritualism and Selina's powers. Ultimately, I found Ms. Waters writing to be just as seductive as Selina. <br />This is the first of her books that I had read and I can't wait to read more.  <br />

1416905014|5.0|I found this book for my little girl, after discovering a Dinosaur and Shark book for my son. It is so beautiful I sat in awe for about 30 minutes looking at it when I first received it. It's not Disney's Cinderella, so don't look for any comparisons. Instead, it is a beautiful story full of imaginative pop-ups that allow little girls to pretend they are in the story as Cinderella herself. My little girl (2 years) just loves to sit with me and my husband and flip through the story. Even my 3 year old boy loves to look at it!
B00004D3C1|1.0|What's up with the mix?  The drums are way so out front they drown everything.  Maybe they were supposed to be \\"lead drums\\", which in theory would have not been a bad idea because Fu Manchu had Brandt Bjork, one of the greatest drummers, ever...except he doesn't do anything on this release except play a basic back beat with little else.  A major disappointed if you're expecting Brandt's type of explosive anything goes work with Kyuss.  The only other excuse to have made the drums louder than everything else would have been to mask the weak unexceptional tunes on this disk.  Even the guitar playing is lame.  This was obviously the beginning of the end.  If your new to Fu Manchu, start with the \\"The Action is Go\\" then work backwards through the great Eddy Glass/Ruben Romano era Fu Manchu.

B00005JP4U|1.0|Al Gore and company need to get their facts straight before setting image to celluloid, but that's never stopped them before.  \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is junk science promoted by the loony liberal left and is just another scare tactic that they will embrace as their cause du jour.  A better use of time and brainpower would be to read the book \\"Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media\\" by Patrick J. Michaels....but then Mr. Micheals didn't invent the Internet.
038572179X|1.0|I found the pacing of this novel to be very slow and the characters  were stereotypical.  There is so much detail that little is left to the imagination.   <br />The elaborate descriptions are distracting. There are way too many scenes where nothing of interest is happening.
B00005JP4U|5.0|I have some observations, some positive and some negative:<br /><br />1) The film is an appeal to viewers' intellect.  A film like this is rare.  We live in anti-intellectual times, where sound-bites rule the day, violence is glorified in the media, concentrated greed trumps civility and common sense, and steroid-fueled atheletes are considered \\"heroes.\\"  The popular movie that appeals to the altruistic thinking person, with an analytic, fact-finding mind, is a rarity, so this is indeed welcome.  More of this sort of thing, please!<br /><br />2) The movie is clearly a self-aggrandizing, self-indulgent attempt by Gore to improve his image and consolidate his power.  It may not be partisan (in the Republican vs. Democrat sense) but the people who say this isn't partisan need to unclog their carotid arteries a little.  Well, that sounds more negative than I intended because I like Gore and I love the fact he's dedicated to increasing public awareness of an important topic.  There's no doubt that Gore has emphasized environmental issues for many years. But notice that the focus is on Gore.  The key scientists are rarely actually named, especially if they are living, though they are the real heroes.  Sure, Gore names a few but not the ones I would have expected.  Long standing activists and writers are also omitted, such as Paul and Anne Erlich, Barry Commoner, Amory Lovins, etc., etc.  Many of you left the movie enamored of Gore.  But please take a deeper look at the science, the issue and the politician.  The science and the issue are hugely important.  I'm more interested in seeing politicians use their power to address environmental issues than in seeing environmental issues co-opted to increase the power of specific lobbies and individuals.<br /><br />3) It is a nice layman's intro to global warming.  It is much deeper than the sound-bite garbage that you see on TV.  If you are the rare person who is really interested in the science underlying the issue, then learn more about the topic, minus the agendas of Al Gore and Hollywood.  Become familiar, for instance, with the work of Ralph Cicerone, one of the founders of atmospheric chemistry and current president of the National Academy of Science.  He's a great scientist, and a good guy (and add points for the fact he's married to a great sensory scientist... ok, that's my issue).  Take 5 minutes online to find and read Cicerone's (July 21, 2005) CURRENT STATE OF CLIMATE SCIENCE: RECENT STUDIES FROM THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES. Then, take half an hour or so to listen to an interview with Cicerone from NASonline (using RealPlayer).  You'll hear one of America's greatest scientists outlining the facts, the scientific debates, and the remaining questions.  You can find a few right-wing crackpots who take pot shots at Cicerone, but he's the real deal.<br /><br />4) It is pro-science.  This is a key point in this time of anti-scientific thinking. The film has the potential to increase viewers' interest in science and scientific thinking.  Whether or not you accept the science as it is presented in the film, this is an important point.  Don't stop here, as this film is the finger pointing at science, not science per se.  If you don't believe the theories and facts presented here, then you can bring your own science and facts to the table.  Putting an emphasis on theory, facts, and data is pro science.  If you can't handle this, go back to watching football, getting fat on your couch, and voting for Bush, or whatever.  You won't be alone, so smile.<br /><br />5) It is a beautiful film with striking graphics.  If, like me, you love a good graph or informative picture, take a look at Kosslyn's new book on making graphs.  Kosslyn is the world's greatest expert on imagery, and is a cognitive and neural scientist extraordinaire.  Telling a story in graphs and pictures is hugely important.  Kudos to the filmmakers for the quality of their graphics.<br /><br />6) The movie is an advertisement for Apple computer and Apple products. Perhaps this is not obvious. But Apple technology is everywhere in the film, and also the accompanying book. The computers are displayed prominently, and the Keynote program is at the heart of Gore's presentation. Gore is on Apple's board of directors. You can learn more about Apple's link to the film/book/Gore at Apple's website. I'm a big fan of Apple and its innovative technologies, so I'm not complaining. But don't miss the fact that you are being lulled into buying Apple products.<br /><br />7) It is strong motivation do something important in life; to make changes that contribute to the greater good.  And the film is strong motivation to commit yourself to the future, but to live your life as if there will be no tomorrow.  Want to read a great book on conscious, effective activism?  Read Andrew Beath's \\"Consciousness in Action: The Power of Beauty, Love and Courage in a Violent Time\\"<br /><br />8) The Bush adminsitration is a noteworthy part of the global warming story, but this is not emphasized by Gore.  Sure, there are some allusions to Bush's shortsightedness.  But the disturbing fact is that the Bush administration has been attempting to silence the global warming story. Gore didn't mention this, for political reasons, I'm sure. The administration has been doing more to silence scientists than any previous administration, apparently. Don't believe me? NASAs top climate scientist, Jim Hansen, is but one person who discusses this fact. For instance, watch Revkin's interview with Hansen available online at the New York Times website. When pressured by the NYT, Bush admitted to forcing scientists to shift their public positions on global warming. Bush publicly denies the importance of the issue. His link to fossil fuel dollars is one reason for this, to be sure. Bush is the enemy. That's a fact.  The book that seems to clarify the political issues is the one I'm reading at the moment: \\"The Republican War on Science\\", by Chris Mooney.<br /><br />9) There's a book and website that accompany the movie.

B0000024W3|4.0|Greil Marcus may have trashed this album, but it's not that bad.  In fact, if you ignore the horrendous press it has gotten over the years, it's pretty good.  It's incoherent and sloppily constructed, but there are some wonderful gems here.  This CD/album is, to me, an extension of Dylan's Nashville Skyline period.  His voice sounds like it did on that album, warm, sweet, and kind.  And the album definitely has a low fi, countryish, mellow mood to it.  It's not a masterpiece, but there's something here for everyone, especially Dylan fans.<br /><br />All the Tired Horses is a really cool way to start the album (Dylan doesn't even sing on this track, it's just a chorus and orchestration).  Living the Blues is a great song.  Dylan's cover of I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know is beautiful, and his version of Blue Moon is charming.  The instrumental Woogie Boogie is cool, better than the similarly title Wiggle Wiggle from the wretched Under the Red Sky (which is worse than this album).  The Mighty Quinn is great, too.<br /><br />The live version of Like a Rolling Stone is OK.  Dylan's voice isn't as angry as it is in the original, and he flubs the lyrics a few times.  It's a very mellow, comparitively quiet rendition.  The crowd is appreciative, though.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a Dylan fan, pick this up.  There are enough great Dylan songs here for Dylan fans.  This is far better than Greil Marcus infamous \\"what is this $##$%\\" line.<br /><br />If Dylan should have taken a little more care assembling this album, he might have had a minor masterpiece.
B0007GAERG|5.0|And it's not \\"We Belong Together\\" even though for most this song defines where she is now musically. Personally I felt \\"Its Like That\\" was her best work so far (yes...over her ballads which made her a vocal force to be reckoned with). The lyrics are clever, tongue-in-cheek, fun and you can tell she had fun just to sing it. The song also changes at certain points with good results like when she goes: \\"It's my night. No stress. No fights.\\"- she starts to harmonize with the piano playing in the background (showing her classy side) and then goes back into the chorus featuring the club-banging beats. And the fact that it was the first single from this album showed how much faith Mariah had in the song. The whole album is good. Especially with consistent quality on tracks like \\"Stay the Night\\", \\"Shake it Off\\", \\"Mine Again\\", Mariah displays her abilities to still make catchy good mainstream music. Oh and it's also her best produced album since \\"Butterfly\\".
B00006JKOL|4.0|I don't think there are three better consecutive songs on any Tull album than \\"Ministrel in the Gallery\\", \\"Cold Wind to Valhalla\\", and \\"Black Satin Dancer.\\" They all rock and have moments of subtle beauty as well. The flute and guitar performances are some of Martin's and Ian's all-time best. I think the extra tracks compliment the orginal album very nicely, especially \\"Summerday Sands\\", a real gem, and Pan Dance, a very interesting instrumental piece. This is one of my very favorite Tull albums, (I love them all!), and if you let the \\"Minstrels\\" into your home, I'm sure you'll love this one too.
B000099T2L|4.0|I don't know why but Beyonce reminds me of Diana Ross (career-wise). Think about it! - Girl groups. Standout performer. Solo productions. Movies (Dreamgirls may become Beyonce's Lady Sing the Blues). The only thing that Beyonce has done so far in her career that Diana couldn't was win some Grammys (But the Grammys are hardly known to award artistic merit over \\"who's hot now\\" or \\"What veterans haven't we awarded recently\\" or \\"Who just died\\"- Hey it's true most of the time!)And Diana and Beyonce both represent to many people past and present (not me personally) the definitive \\"Diva\\". <br />Ok- back to talking about this album. The first half was great! \\"Crazy in Love\\" was the best released single of 2003! I mean the horns and go-go beat(thank you Rich Harrison), Jay-Z's verse, catchy chorus, and the vocals made that song become the reason why Beyonce is R&B's leading lady today (soon to release B'Day 9/4). \\"Baby Boy\\" \\"Me Myself, and I\\" and \\"Be With You\\" are other highlights. For some reason at first I hated \\"Hip Hop Star\\" but now I think that song is great. It's not as catchy as the singles but I love the creativeness put into the track with the rock sound mixed with a hip-hop beat and B's weird vocals. I hope Beyonce displays this creativeness in future projects. I'll admit the second half is too full of ballads. The last two tracks can be easily skipped. And was that second song featuring Jay-Z necessary? We got the full effect with the first two collaborations! (Bonnie and Clyde and Crazy in Love being the first two, with \\"Deja-Vu\\" now we got a fourth one to add.) And was the duet with Luther really necessary? Nowhere near as beautiful as the Roberta and Donny version. But other than that I must say B released a well done debut.
B000065AI3|5.0|Here are the beginnings of one the greatest songwriters and bands in rock and roll history. This album has some really great tunes that have largely remained ignored by classic rock radio.\\"The Wild One, Forever\\" is a song that really moved me the first time I heard it and still does. \\"Luna\\" is an intriguing song that reminds me of \\"Supernatural Radio\\" that was recorded on the \\"Yellow Album\\" some 20 years later in 1996. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Tom and Heartbreakers live this year in June, and they played a real lost classic, \\"Fooled Again (I don't like it)\\" which has a great riff. \\"Mystery Man\\" features some incredible slide guitar work by Mike Campbell that you can still hear today 30 years later. If you want to understand how Tom Petty got his start, you must have this cd!
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|I don't really feel like writing a lot but I do want to say that I love this album. I was very skeptical about a Rihanna album. I didn't buy her first one because I figured all her songs would sound like \\"Mr. DJ\\". I wasn't going to buy this one because i assumed all her songs would sound like SOS (I liked SOS, but I don't want to hear it over and over again). Unfaithful, Girl Like Me, this album is hot! Rihanna did her thing!
B000GFRJ58|5.0|When I bought this disc I was skeptical as to how good the 5.1 mix would be.  First, of all of Townshend's solo albums, this one seemed to me to be the least best candidate for a surround sound mix.  Second, the 5.1 mix that Townshend had done for the Who's classic Tommy had not impressed me.  Within one minute of putting this dual disc into my dvd player though, I realized that this was exactly the sort of surround sound mix I always hope I will be getting.  There are enough unique, specific events going on in the rear speakers so that you know they're there, but not so much as to be overwhelming.  The 5.1 mix was done by long-time Who soundman Bob Pridden who should be given high praise.  Hopefully Pridden will be in charge of any future surround sound mixes that are to be done for the Who/Townshend catalog.  The interview section of the disc could have had some more talk from Pete, but that's the only minor complaint I can think of.
1594200106|5.0|What Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera do for magic realism, Carlos Ruiz Zafon's brilliant novel does for psychological realism--weaving us into a spell so compelling that we don't want to leave the world he creates no matter how complex it becomes, no matter how dark its exploration of human nature with all its tenderness and savagery. This is a book about the power of books, and you will want to read it again the moment you've come to the last page--truly a masterpiece.
0440203856|5.0|Wonderfully written! <br />I have never been as emotional with any book as I was with this one. I felt the pain that Zoya felt all through my entire body. And her happiness made my heart flutter! <br />This is a wonderful story, a little too much tragedy and heartache for my taste, but nevertheless, I could not put this book down. It was my first Danielle Steel book, and it had such an impact on me, that I have yet to read another one of her books. Not because I don't like her or her style, but because the story felt so real, that I need time to get over the heartache and tragedy. <br />I admire Zoya and her strength, you fall in love with her family and her friends, and her husbands. After reading this story, you feel like you can face anything.  <br />You will not be disappointed with this book. Read it!!

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|When I heard people talk about this film I thought, \\"Oh no, not another art-house snooze-fest! Where's my beret?\\". But I was wrong. This is a great film, very entertaining. Any fan of film noir will get a kick out of this mixture of \\"Dawson's Creek\\" and \\"The Big Sleep\\". <br /> <br /> Brick is one amazing film due to its heavy use of tough-guy/gal talk and typical film noirish characters juxtaposed against a suburban Californian teen environment. But it simply works - you laugh at the funny parts and are on the edge of your seat at the tense parts. <br /> <br />I give high praise to the director and the cast of Brick. I can't wait to see this director's next film.
B000301YY8|1.0|I saw a concert of James Blunt on TV.  Well 15 minutes of it, the most I could stand.  I tried to understand the hype.  His single \\"You're beautiful\\" is god-awful.  I think it became a hit just because chicks like to hear these words in songs.  During his show he sang a song with a terrible chorus that goes like \\"I'm shallow, yeah yeah\\" something like that.  Just thinking about those horrible sounds and stupid lyrics makes me angry. Don't ever play this music in an anger management class or you will provoke a city-wide rampage! <br /> <br />Another I don't understand, Norah Jones.  What a boring repetitive lifeless sleep-inducing singer. <br /> <br />
B000G73UEU|5.0|I am a great fan of Cohen's music and voice (less so of the man) and have many of his albums.  Despite that fact, after seeing the movie \\"I'm Your Man,\\" I had to have this album as well.  Consisting of Cohen's songs sung by others, including several members of the Wainwright/McGarrigle family, the soundtrack was superb.  I'd never heard of Antony before but am hooked on his version of \\"If It Be Your Will.\\" The only disappointment was that the album did not include the soul-melting rendition of \\"1000 Kisses Deep\\" that was in the movie. The least appealing song was \\"Tower of Song,\\" the only song sung by Cohen (w/ U2), but it is one of my least favorites.    <br /> <br />

I have always loved Godzilla, and I mean the real Godzilla.  The sad part is, I can see that this movie was trying to give a modern view of the old Godzilla films, but to no effect.  A budget does not make a movie.  It was not the actors, it was the plot!  Nothing else needs to be said.

This movie, however, is not about a hit man, but the illegal arms trade in the Middle East, Synergy, and the cruelty of the Arab subculture.  These were vignettes in the Persian Gulf, Washington, D.C., Houston (the 5th largest oil producing city), and other California sites and desert scenes with no continuity.  It was back and forth with no explanation, jerky conversations with the Arabic language sounding like they were talking to a cow perhaps, not to other Arabs.  Even their language sounded like they were spouting profanities.  There was absolutely (I hate that word!) too much jabbering, too fast to keep up with trying to read the quick subtitles.  It was frustrating as too much of the meetings and action took place in the dark.  Not enough articulation in English and it was filmed primarily for the American public.    I was disappointed that George Clooney had to use that artificial beard to cover his beautiful face.  I hope he sees himself in this movie and stays on a fitness routine, as he does not a good-looking fat man make.  The lighting and his makeup make him appear as foreign.    It was pure dullsville, like \\"Good Night and Good Luck\\" with low-key conversations and expresssionless acting.  I already knew, but you may have missed the comment in the beginning that John Rockefeller founded the University of Chicago as a subversive college; my son, Geoff, was married in the Rockefeller Chapel on campus.  I was there!    In this vastly different documentary-type movie with a big star, some were told to learn the language.  It had no explanations as to what was happening, just shortcuts.  The Iranians were portrayed as being rational, but we know different.  Such a strange culture, back in the ancient ages with their type of punishment and violence.  I watched the video twice and, as you can see, I really did not get much out of it.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Yup....fans asked for the original versions seen in theaters....so Lucas has now released the original theatrical versions UNEDITED (wich means NO anamorphic WS). Fans got what they asked for its that simple. <br /> <br />Then, after the announcment of these DVDs I hear all over SW message boards that fans now DONT want the original theatrical versions....they want anamprphic WS versions with upgraded picture qaulity. So wich is it? If you want the anamorphic and upgraded picture qaulity and sound qaulity versions then WATCH THE VERSIONS RELEASED IN 2004! The changes Lucas made are NOTHING...they are still amazing movies and are even better than before.  <br /> <br />Lets see....I have seen people say they want a certain version and others say they want a different one.... <br /> <br />New versions <br />Theatrical versions Unedited (including no anamprphic enhancement, picture or sound enhancements) <br />Theatrical versions WITH all of the picture and sound enhancements. <br />Theatrical versions with only a few of the re-edited stuff from the new versions <br /> <br />UGH. Lucas cannot please EVERYONE. People asked for the Theatrical un-edited versions and that is EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE GETTING! And people still complain. <br /> <br />I love the movies no matter what changes have been made and know that Lucas thinks his movies are not yet finished so I say let him finish and stop complaining.  <br /> <br />If you dont like the changes then dont watch Star Wars anymore.  <br /> <br />Also, people also complain about them releasing yet another set of the trilogy and think the company is just squeezing money out of us. That is true. But look at the companies view....all of the movie companies are running out of movies to put on DvD so they have to do this kind of stuff to still make money. <br /> <br />HD-DVD or Blu-Ray will bring new life to the movie studios but remember this....eventually they will start to run out of movies to put on HD-DVD or Blu-Ray and they will use these same stratigies seen on DVD to make money.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Reflecting on the spectrum of Children of Bodom's ever-intensifying progression of heaviness, any Bodom-ite would classify their debut \\"Something Wild\\" as a relatively light, slightly more neoclassical album as well as a foreboding testament to their future legacy when compared to their later works. Its successors, \\"Hatebreeder,\\" \\"Follow The Reaper,\\" \\"Hate Crew Deathroll,\\" and \\"Are You Dead Yet?\\" only grew heavier with each release, resulting in a sound far deviated from their original roots and endulged in a Saint-Anger-esque level of metal conformity and compositional lethargy present in 80% of all heavy bands today. However, the only way to find fault with a group with such a great magnitude as Bodom is to hold them to the extremely high standards they had set themselves. Whether they embraced the darker side of metal coincidentally consistent with mainstream artists to gain a larger fanbase or because they felt musically inclined to is not for me to say, nor is it the point to this review. <br /> <br />\\"Hatebreeder\\", Bodom's second effort, not only lacks the weighted breakdowns and oversimplified melodies of their latest, but also showcases their unbound speed, harmony, and musical diversity that is present in only one other album--\\"Something Wild\\". The difference between the two is Hatebreeder's apparent refinement in production and riff-writing though Something Wild arguably retained a larger bulk of instrumental technicalities. All in all, Children of Bodom's two frontmen--Alexi Laiho and Janne Warman (guitar/vocals and keyboard, respectively)--far transcended the boundaries of mundane musicianship to a level of previously unmatched talent not only limited to black metal, but also including the entire history of rock music. Both men are some of the best of what they do, all expressionistic niceties aside, and this is apparent throughout the album. If you've never experienced Children of Bodom before, there is no better album to start on than Hatebreeder; if you have already heard Bodom's work before, than you can't afford to form any opinion--good or bad--before listening to this, the pinnacle of their career thus far.
B000002C2E|5.0|Before \\"Time Out of Mind\\" appeared in 1997 Bob Dylan had not released any newly written material in seven years. Many cynical detractors thought, and hoped, that he had finally deflated to mush. Yes, they seemed to say, we knew he'd burn out and begin farting dust sooner or later! Now pay the fiddler! Truth is, following two albums of folk classics and an MTV \\"Unplugged\\" album even some fans began to wonder whether Bob had put his muse eternally out to pasture. Not to mention that, as the mortal sun sets, many artists eventually do run out of steam. And by that time Dylan had more than traversed his semicentennial. Who can blame a man for getting old? Time happens. But then suddenly a miracle. Like a Daniel Lanois theme to a resurrection film, \\"Time Out of Mind\\" magically condensed onto the half-full glass. No, onto the overflowing and deluging glass. And zowie what an album. And what a comeback (one of the most earth-shattering in a career of \\"comebacks\\"). The incredulous masses just couldn't believe that he still had it; that he hadn't rusted; that he kept re-inventing himself with such freshness. No rock star of Dylan's age has ever come back with such fervent Lazarus gusto. Some even rank \\"Time Out of Mind\\" on par with \\"Blood On the Tracks\\".<br /><br />Much like that 1975 classic, \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" showcases the broken hearted hoping to die Dylan pining for lost love. He even sobs \\"like a fool\\". Most of the songs find him helplesly drowning in total anguish. \\"Love Sick\\" wags its tongue at the very notion of love. We've all done it. Fess up. But this puerile waggling covers a scorching truth: he's really sick of unrequited love. After all, when love works it revives completely. But when it doesn't it's worse than an enema. Some take succor from denial, as Dylan demonstrates here. This song open the album with a huge bang.<br /><br />A vagabound theme runs through many of the songs. Classic folkies and bluesies hit the road as a lifestyle, too. Here Dylan \\"goes down the road feeling bad\\", he walks down dirt roads until his eyes bleed, he goes to Missouri, to New Orleans, Sugar Town, London, \\"gay Paree\\", the \\"lonesome valley\\", and \\"Boston Town\\". Dylan really does a lot of traveling on this album. But he confesses \\"I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still\\". The neverending tour? Throughout eleven songs Dylan paints life as a journey to nowhere. For well over an hour he mourns lost love and lost life. Well, no one claimed that \\"Time Out of Mind\\" makes a good bedtime story.<br /><br />The sprawling \\"Highlands\\" finds Dylan openly envying youth and spitting on the \\"same rat race life in the same ol' cage\\". But some badly needed comedic relief comes to the rescue when he runs into the waitress in Boston town. At over fourteen minutes, it belongs in the rare category of epic Dylan songs (with \\"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\" and \\"Joey\\"). The song closes, after more rambling an ruminating on the inexorable passage of time, with the line \\"And that's good enough for now\\". This line also closes the album. Well, \\"Time Out of Mind\\" is more than good enough for now. But in reality, and maybe in love, that's usually the attainable standard. That's how we often get by. With \\"good enough\\".<br /><br />The murky themes reach their peak on Dylan's naked perusal of death \\"Not Dark Yet\\". The unforgettable line \\"I was born here and I'll die here against my will\\" applies to every one of us. Here Dylan fully examines the autumn of life that's \\"Not dark yet, but it's getting there.\\" The song has an eerie feel to it that Lanois later used on Emmylou Harris' \\"Red Dirt Girl\\". This song, and \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" belong on the list of Dylan classics.<br /><br />With this album Dylan again proves that he doesn't wear his solemn past on his sleeve. Musically, he even seems to have forgotten about this \\"glorious\\" past. Which arguably provides the key to his power of reinvention: he doesn't dwell on his musical past; he constantly looks forward. That's how revelations like \\"Time Out of Mind\\" happen. Unfortunately, his method also leads to the occasional clunker. But those few clunkers remain a small price to pay for albums like \\"Time Out of Mind\\". To make things more astonishing, the 2001 follow up \\"Love and Theft\\" was just as acclaimed by critics and fans. And now, in 2006, \\"Modern Times\\" has many kowtowing once again to the aging but forever young shaper of twentieth century music. It will take more than an army to stop this neverending tour.forward. That's how revelations like \\"Time Out of Mind\\" happen. Unfortunately, his method also leads to the occasional clunker.

B000002C2E|4.0|Okay, I like this one, Love & Theft is good, and I have yet to hear Modern Times though it's on my wishlist. Are we looking at a new golden age for Dylan here?<br /><br />Anyhoo, Time out of Mind is certainly a sobering record, containing meditations on mortality, lost love, all that good stuff. But it's not a dreary, depressing record. Why? Dylan's deadpan sense of humor holds through, a fact some people tend to overlook. Key songs include Love Sick, Standing in the Doorway, Not Dark Yet, Cold Irons Bound and the mini-novel Highlands.<br /><br />A few downsides? Dylan's voice is a big one - I actually didn't mind it on his 60's records, because it was appropriate for what he was singing (come on, can you imagine Marvin Gaye singing Subterranean Homesick Blues or Like a Rolling Stone?). But years of smoking have caught up to him, and it's extremely gravelly. Granted, it fits what he's singing, but it can get on the nerves.  His backing musicians are nowhere near what they used to be - why can't he revive the Highway Sixty-One Revisited group? - but that's about it.<br /><br />Also recommended Dylan:<br /><br />Blood on the Tracks<br /><br />Highway Sixty-One Revisited<br /><br />Bringing It All Back Home<br /><br />Blonde on Blonde<br /><br />Another Side of<br /><br />Freewheelin'<br /><br />Love & Theft<br /><br />And, just for fun, Dylan to steer clear of:<br /><br />New Morning<br /><br />John Wesley Harding<br /><br />The crappy Born-Again Christian Records<br /><br />Knocked Out Loaded<br /><br />Down in the Groove
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Bob is back, with a compilation of some fabulous tunes. Thunder on the Mountain and Workingman's Blues #2 are instant classics. Nobody is making music anymore, except maybe U2 and a few others. Someday Baby and Rollin' and Tumblin' are also quite good. His band is one of the best out there. Just go see them live if you do not believe. This CD will be in the CD changer for quite some time.
B000001FS3|5.0|While I myself like U2, I can understand why there are those who do not. Much like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin, their music is essentially unavoidable - hell, even I got burnt out on Where the Streets Have No Name back in the '90s and early '00s, though it's a lot easier to enjoy now that I don't have to hear it on the radio every day. Then again, I don't listen to the radio that much anymore.<br />Anyway, overplayed as they may be, I consider myself a U2 fan, or should I say an '80s U2 fan. Most of the '80s was a musical wasteland (at least according to my experience - I wasn't alive back then, so I probably don't know the half of it), but U2 brought a ton of sincerity and a will to experiment that made so many of their albums - Boy, War, The Unforgettable Fire - so good. This great Eno production is pretty experimental too, but that's not all I like about it. This one's a triumph of songwriting as much as it is experimentation.<br />It's tough to pick a favorite on this album when so many songs qualify. The massive hit Where the Streets Have No Name is one competitor - a great build-up, charging verses, soaring choruses. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For (another one I heard way too many times, though again I love it now) probably is the weakest of the album's three inescapable hits, but it also has the best hook, and to call it \\"weakest\\" isn't exactly an insult to it or anything. Now, With or Without You is the strongest of the three inescapable hits (Where the Streets Have No Name being the third) - forget what I said earlier, I think this is my favorite song on the album, maybe my favorite U2 song period. Some people see Bono as pompous. and while sometimes that's true (the entire October album, for instance), he's as earnest as he ever got. \\"I can't live... with or without you...\\" is a lyric with an edge, that's for sure. My favorite part of the song (and maybe album) is when the whole band suddenly kicks in, Bono screams, \\"Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa...\\", and the song unexpectedly becomes a rocker. Then again, the whole song is just perfection. I'm serious. You think Twisted Sister or the Eurhythmics could've dome something that good? I don't. Bullet the Blue Sky and the almost frightening Exit are two of the most intense, compelling songs U2 has ever done; Running to Stand Still is a chilling drug protest - like Bad, but introspective rather than epic. And the propulsive One Tree Hill is yet another personal favorite of mine.<br />Those are just the top songs, though: it's hard to deny the power of the cathartic Red Hill Mining Town, the fun bluesy stomp Trip Through Your Wires has a great harmonica part; and In God's Country is actually kind of funky, believe it or not.<br />It's tempting to call this U2's indisputable best album. I can't, though. One song keeps it from that title. Remember all those ambient songs on The Unforgettable Fire, like Promenade/4th of July and Indian Summer Sky? Remember how boring they were? Well, Mothers of the Disappeared is also ambient, and it's also boring. Sure, its intentions are good, but it's just a dull song. The only one on the album, if you ask me. So there's a massively intense smackdown between this and War as U2's best album, but this secured U2's status as a great band - much better than most of their '80s (and most of their '90s and '00s ones - I'd much rather hear U2 than Green Day, Good Charlotte, Limp Bizkit or any of those stupid commercial rock bands today). If you hate U2 with a passion, this probably won't do anything to stop that hatred - indeed, I'm pretty sure its massive success is what brought a lot of people to an anti-U2 stance in the first place. But if you like the group, it's really a hard album to go wrong with. Most fans probably have it in the first place.unexpectedly becomes a rocker. Then again, the whole song is just perfection.

0767834739|1.0|After seeing the first Resident Evil movie and liking it, I was expecting a whole lot more from this film, which I had been anticipating as soon as I found out they were going to make a sequel. Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn't have any of the things that made the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game, with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles, did a fantastic job. <br /> <br />RE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you're expecting a horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and action genres. There's no character development, the plot is shallow and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one. <br /> <br />I found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they'd improved upon the first movie's many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses. <br /> <br />In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released next year. Somebody would literally have to pay me to see it!  <br />
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Anyone who is interested in heavy music should know about Van Halen.  Not everyone has to like them, but their influence on rock and metal music is undeniable.  The band's two most famous members are David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen, who are both incredibly talented and charismatic.  Roth's vocal style is showy and extravagant, commanding attention with every sultry phrase.  Eddie's guitar playing is wildly original, blending classic rock and blues ingredients with his own finger-tapping techniques and glitzy effects.  Not only can Eddie play incredibly fast, but he can also write amazing riffs and craft solos which are memorable and melodic.   <br /> <br />The rhythm section, made up of drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony, is solid, unrelenting and groovy.  Neither of them is as talented a musician as DLR or EVH, but they contribute excellently to the band and fill their respective positions nicely.   <br /> <br />Like all of Van Halen's albums during David Lee Roth's era (their first six), Van Halen I is short.  In my opinion, this is the album's greatest flaw, as it's only 35 minutes in length, which, surprisingly, makes it the longest DLR-era VH album.  Nevertheless, there isn't enough material on the album, but what is here is excellent. <br /> <br />There are 11 tracks in all--9 originals and 2 covers.  None of the tracks reaches the 4 minute mark, which isn't at all surprising, as Van Halen were a very listener, radio-friendly band with brief, catchy songs that just about anyone could enjoy.  This isn't at all a bad thing, and is part of what makes Van Halen so appealing and timeless. <br /> <br />The album works very well as a compilation of party songs, with every track being catchy and rollicking in a different way.  This is an upbeat, energetic and mostly cheerful album, a formulat which Van Halen continued to use on subsequent albums.  They established themselves as a fun-loving band with a straightforward, celebratory, hard-rocking-yet-poppy sound.  <br /> <br />While every song on the album is of a high quality, the following are the true standouts and deserve special recognition: <br /> <br />Runnin' with the Devil - One of Van Halen's most celebrated and well-known songs, it's endlessly catchy and has an appealing, sing-along chorus.  It's almost entirely free of EVH's usual flashy soloing, making it a relatively modest piece. <br /> <br />Eruption - As if to make up for his lack of presence on Runnin' with the Devil, Eddie is given an entire track just as a guitar solo.  The song is literally a guitar solo, with a brief drum introduction by Alex, followed by nothing but Eddie's hypnotic, electrifying solo.  It's one of the most famous solos of all time, with a level of flashiness, virtuosity, melodicism and originalityy that had arguably never been seen before.  Eddie went on to perform live versions of the song which were sometimes three or four times as long as this original recording.  The famous finger-tapped \\"theme\\" is a favorite among guitar players and fans alike.  Simply incredible.  <br /> <br />Feel Your Love Tonight - a catchy, poppy, radio-friendly hit if there ever was one.  Of course, there's a healthy does of EVH flash thrown in for good measure.  An infectious, satisfying, feel-good song which any fan will appreciate.   <br /> <br />As for the rest of the material--it's all great.  Eddie Van Halen and Roth are consistently entertaining.  Some say EVH is overrated, though I would defend his talent with every ounce of credibility and persuasion I can muster.  He truly was far ahead of his time, and I can only imagine how he would have fit into a band in modern day.  His guitar playing was revoultionary and inspired countless musicians and guitar legends in the years to follow the release of this album.   <br /> <br />Though you could argue about whether this is VH's best album, it still stands that it was a landmark release with some of the band's most important pieces.  Absolutely essential.  Don't miss out on this.    <br /> <br />
B000EHRVP6|5.0|(Note: This review is specifically for the unrated version of Hostel.) <br /> <br />First of all, let me say that Lion's Gate, responsible for the film's distribution, has come a long way from the days when it was almost exclusively synonymous with bad B-movies. It has become one of the major distributors of good horror movies that push the envelope, such as the Saw franchise and High Tension, and it could now be said that it's a patron of the genre. <br /> <br />Hostel develops an interesting premise and is better seen in ignorance of any plot summaries/background information on the movie. In the style of Asian horror, there is plenty of over-the-top gore, and in the style of campy American horror, there's plenty of nudity, but this doesn't detract from the ability of the director, Eli Roth, to take us to new and ever darker places as the plot thickens, building suspense right up to the gratifying finale. <br /> <br />Unlike many horror movies nowadays, it has an ending that provides some closure and does not leave you thinking that a sequel sometime in the near future is inevitable, although IMO this concept could be taken further and the movie ended too soon for me. Then again I'm somewhat jaded when it comes to horror fiction in general, so maybe it's just the right length to not overwhelm non-targeted audiences. <br /> <br />Because of the level of entertainment, I have to give this movie a 10 within the genre. It has everything the modern horror fan could want, like good direction, great makeup and special effects, an atmosphere all its own. and a main character that is believable because he's not making the cliché, inane mistakes that most horror leads are scripted to make with the inexplicable notion that this somehow adds to the scare factor. <br /> <br />If you are not easily grossed out or offended, I recommend renting or, better yet, buying Hostel. Who knows? You may want to revisit it... <br />
B000002ADT|5.0|Enjoying my purchase a lot; takes me \\"back to the day.\\"  Arrived timely, in good repair.  Would order from you again.
0792164903|5.0|The movie, Sleepy Hollow, embodies Tim Burton's unique take on one of the most well-known horror tales of all time, with a few new plot twists and greater character development, including a dark past for Ichabod Crane and a \\"story behind the story\\" of what's going on in the haunted town, which is beautifully rendered, dark and foggy for an eerie atmosphere. <br /> <br />The dream cast puts in great performances, but obviously it's Johnny Depp who steals the show with his intuitive and sometimes over-the-top portrayal of the anti-hero, Ichabod Crane, who displays admirable bravery while at the same time often succumbing to fear. <br /> <br />The lavish production, masterful acting, background music, beautiful periodic sets and costumes and the careful attention to detail, most notable in the special effects used to bring the headless horseman \\"to life\\", if you will, all come together to tell the tale of Sleepy Hollow's plight and deliverance as it's never been told before. It's unlikely that this cinematic version will ever be surpassed. Superb!  <br /> <br />

B000301YY8|1.0|I had the...misfortune...of hearing Goodbye My Lover while listening to James' CD yesterday at a friend's house.  I was drawn to the song, much like you are drawn to the window when you hear the sounds of felines caterwauling outside.   Do people buy his stuff? Are they the same people who forward those emails about the sick kids asking for puppies or the ones with poems written from the grave, saying if you don't forward it to nine people, a large Acme safe will fall on your head?  <br /> <br />I don't have ice water in my veins, but his lyrics were the most maudlin I've heard in a long time....that, along with his feigned teary-eyed expression he gets while he sings....I was nearly heaving by the end. I just don't get it...  <br />
1400032717|2.0|I bought the book based on the recommendations of friends and family. After reading the many positive reviews, I decided to finaly start reading it. I honestly have to say I was very disappointed. While I rarely disagree with Amazon's readers, I have to say this book barely ranks a 2 star. Its an excellent window into an autistic mind if thats what you're looking for, but as a causual read, the author goes off on too many tangents unrelated to the plot. The characters are shallow, and the events that transpire are hardly exciting. It left me exhausted from the constant shifting of subjects, and irrelevant paragraphs. I am utterly surprised at the significant positive feedback this book has received. I dont recommend this book unless you have a vested interest in autism.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|As is not unusual with a Dylan album, I had to listen to Modern Times twice through before the greatness of it began to sink in. That might be because on the first listen, I could hardly wait for the next song (I hadn't allowed myself to hear so much as a clip before I bought the record). So songs like Thunder on the Mountain, Someday Baby, Rollin' and Tumblin', and When the Deal Goes Down, and Beyond the Horizon seemed long and not particularly inventive. My view of these songs changed as I gave myself the time to absorb them. While these songs are obviously not his best, they are still very strong material and help prop up the absolute genius of the other songs. <br /> <br />Workingman's Blues #2, like Mississippi, is a moving latter-years Dylan lament. It is beautiful and sincere, perfectly phrased. Dylan's voice has in my opinion never been as expressive and emotive as it is in this song. <br /> <br />With its descending bass line, Spirit on the Water has the kind of light touch that I would almost expect from Van Morrison. It sounds to me like the most personal song on the record. <br /> <br />Nettie Moore is a strange song that never lets you get too comfortable. The melody line takes a few unexpected turns and the lyrics are perfectly honed. I really think Dylan's lyrics have gotten better, not worse with age. In the mid-60's, when Dylan invented rock music as we know it now, Dylan's lyrics were brilliant and unfocused. Since Oh Mercy, Dylan has used words more sparingly, and to my mind, greater effect. Every word has a purpose and a place. Nothing's wasted here. <br /> <br />Ain't Talkin' is for me the greatest song on the album, and the greatest Dylan song since the 70's. It gave me goosebumps in a way I haven't had since first hearing Foot of Pride. It was the kind of epiphany I had when I first heard Like a Rolling Stone.  <br /> <br />Musically, the arrangments are more austere than Love and Theft, but the band is fantastic.  <br /> <br />I recognize that this album is not the equal of Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde, and a few others perhaps. But I judge a record against contemporary records. If those Dylan albums came out today, they'd break the 5 star ceiling. Modern Times is one of the best records of the millenium and is yet another high point in the career of an American legend. I don't think 5 stars is inappropriate; the current music culture is many times richer today than it was on August 28 because of Modern Times.
0316152196|4.0|Bosch is back. A high-profile, black, civil right attorney is slain and Harry Bosch is given the assignment to find the murderer. To those unfamiliar with Detective Bosch, he is not a \\"go along to get along\\" guy. He tells it like he sees it even if it rankles the Chief of Police, the FBI or other police officers. That is much of the fun in reading a Harry Bosch novel. And I use the word \\"novel\\" in its literary sense; Mr. Connelly has written a novel in ANGEL'S FLIGHT, not a police procedural, although it is a wonderful example of that as well. ANGEL's FLIGHT is really about race relations in Los Angeles and about police-minority relations in particular. The murder mystery in ANGEL'S FLIGHT is just the hat tree on which to hang the fedora of political and racial insights. This is the sixth in the Bosch series and the best-written so far (I am reading them in the order published); Mr. Connelly keeps growing as a writer. For me, the ending was just a little two pat in terms of poetic as well as legal justice being served to make this a five-star book, but one reads Mr. Connelly to learn about Harry Bosch and see him in action more than anything else. At least I do.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I have been listening to DT since about '92 when I received an advance copy of Images & Words while working at the college radio station.  Anyway, that album blew me away and I've enjoyed most of what they have released ever since. <br /> <br />I just cannot get into this album.  I'm not sure if it's me or them but I find it impossibly boring.  I'm sure many fans are pleased by the return of \\"melodic content\\" or whatever they found lacking with Train of Thought but...wow.  This is like boring old man prog.  It makes me itchy to try and sit through it. <br /> <br />2 stars because it's DT and I need to leave room for all the talent-free true garbage out there.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Right off the bat, let me make myself clear - I'm a huge Firefly fan, so I guess this won't be the most objective review in the 'verse, but it's from the heart. <br /> <br />I was deeply saddened when the superb FIREFLY series was cancelled and was keen for the new Serenity film as a chance to enjoy another adventure with the crew and ship I'd come to love. <br />I wasn't disappointed. It's a great film - Sci-fi that's cleverly written, has a real heart to it, a great cast of characters with real chemistry between them, and a wonderful story (works better if you've seen Firefly in my mind, but not essential). <br /> <br />Sure, this won't be everyone's cup of tea - if we all liked the same stuff this would be a boring world - but I'd urge people to try it - more people seem to like Serenity than don't, and you could be missing out on something you really enjoy. See it for yourself and make your own minds up. <br /> <br />As a FIREFLY fan however - I really enjoyed the film and it was great that (should it be the last) it does serve well as a valedictory piece whilst still leaving ample room for more. And though there were moments I disliked (no spoilers here though) on the whole I came out feeling a buzz and excitement I've not felt from a film in a long time. And sure, the movie didn't do that well in the cinemas, but I think poor marketing is to blame, and it now appears to be enjoying the success it deserves on DVD. <br /> <br />Here's hoping we'll get SERENITY II someday soon! <br />
0671027387|3.0|Deception Point is a typical Dan Brown novel, with decent characters and a decent, albeit far-fetched, plot.  One of the more implausible elements of his plot is the presidential debate between the challenging party's presidential candidate and the incumbent party's presidential chief of staff.  This novel also features Mr. Brown's bland writing style.  This author does not know how to write clever similes, or any other figures of speech.
B00005ATQD|4.0|Eyes Wide Shut is a very disturbing, intense film.  Well, I should say the last hour and a half are that way.  The first hour of the film is really slow, and if it weren't Kubrick, I would say it's even pointless.  The problem is, at the end of the movie, I look back on the first hour and all the conversations that took place, and ultimately I think that they make the movie what it is.  A disturbing, contemplative look at the human sexual psyche.<br /><br />Dr. Bill Hartford (Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Kidman) are a seemingly happy married couple.  One night as they are smoking some pot, they get into a substantial argument about Bill's view of women, specifically Alice.  This argument leads Alice to reveal to her husband that she almost had (or would have had, given the opportunity) an affair the last time they were on vacation in Cape Cod.  This upsets Bill and ultimately it is this story of desire that sets Dr. Bill off on his journey.  Obviously, the most famous scene is the orgy where Bill ultimately finds himself late one night.  While the American version has been censored substantially, the scene still does not lose its effect.<br /><br />Rather than go more in-depth in the story, I would just recommend giving the film a chance if you haven't seen it yet.  Cruise and Kidman give great performances, and Sydney Pollack has a good role as a friend of the Hartfords'.  The film is Kubrick in so many ways.  It relies on dialogue, music, and atmosphere to create tension, and it does an amazing job.  If anything, just make yourself get through the first hour, because from there the film takes off and you won't want to leave until you find out what in the world is going on.<br /><br />It really is a shame that this was Kubrick's last movie.  It makes you wish that he had made movies more frequently throughout his career, rather than just one every 6 or 8 years.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|Thought that YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967) was Sean Connery's last \\"Bond\\" film?  Well after they tried George Lazenby in the \\"James Bond\\" role in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969), they brought Sean Connery back for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (1971).<br />  However, 12 years later, Sean Connery returned to be \\"James Bond\\" one last time in NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.  This film is a rarity to see and is not part of the \\"official\\" James Bond package.  It is declared \\"Unofficial\\" because it was made by a different production company, not EON Productions.  You will notice how different the film is by the style it is filmed in and the original cast members were not included.<br />  M (Edward Fox) believes that James Bond (Sean Connery) has slowed down with age and has been put on a strict diet.  Bond reminds M that he now teaches and hasn't been used as a double 00.  Don't worry.  Bond will be right back in action as soon as he finishes his \\"therapy\\" with Miss Fearing (Prunella Gee).<br />  Blofeld (Max Von Sydow) is back in action and will use Largo (Klaus Marie Brandauer) and Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) to avenge James Bond.<br />  Bond's mission is to go to the Bahama's and get closer to Fatima Blush and in Nice he gets to massage Domino (Kim Basinger).  All in a day's work for James Bond.<br />  Sean Connery was 52 at the time of filming and proved he was still in vigorous form.<br />  This film was the longest \\"James Bond\\" film ever made at 2 hours, 17 minutes. Rated PG.<br />  DVD includes spoken languages of English, Spanish.  Subtitles: French, Spanish or choose none.<br />  Movie Trailer for \\"Never Say Never Again\\".<br /><br />  [[ASIN:B000RPCK1K Octopussy]] was released in the same year of 1983 with Roger Moore as \\"James Bond\\".<br /><br /> The next movie is [[ASIN:B00004W9CD A View to a Kill (Special Edition)]] (1985).
B000EGDB10|4.0|Brian De Palma's Mission: Impossible is definitely the most plot- and character-driven M:I movie that there has been so far and probably ever will be.  Considering that this was back before Tom Cruise was publicly insane, his performance in this film is actually very good, as are most of the other actors.  Jon Voight is good, if maybe only adequate, as Jim Phelps, and Henry Czerny has a great supporting role as Kittridge, the agent who is heading up the mole hunt.<br /><br />Even though this is, at heart, a big-budget, summer blockbuster, Brian De Palma definitely puts his stamp on the film.  His stylistic sense of directing and story-telling makes the film much better than it potentially would have been if an average filmmaker had been chosen to helm.  In fact, De Palma even \\"tones it down\\" with his tendency to overemphasize technical wizardry.  About the only trademark we get is a few, spaced out double focus/split screen shots that, as always, work well.  There are no long takes, or no 10 to 20 minute scenes without dialogue.  No over-the-top sex or violence.  But yet somehow, De Palma still puts his stamp on the film.  His Hitchcockian method of storytelling fits this type of film perfectly.  With all the twists near the end, De Palma flashbacks fit in perfectly to help explain everything to the viewer.  And, as always, the music in the film is done perfectly.  The score by Danny Elfman fits in completely with De Palma's handiwork behind the camera.<br /><br />Mission: Impossible was quite a departure for Brian De Palma when he signed on to direct it, but he ended up making a great spy film that still stands up a decade later.
0767827791|5.0|the quality of the dvd was very good considering the age of the movie. to watch it again was great and we enjoyed it as much as the first time back in the fiftys. thank tou.
0312330529|5.0|I truly enjoyed this novel, David Gregory Roberts is a novelist with warmth, integrity and a sense of magic!<br /><br />His personal story, which is compelling and at times heartbreaking, unravels in this novel.  I am captivated by his insight, sensitivity and love of India.  I myself lived in India for many years, and had a very different experience there.  This story opened my eyes to a whole new layer of existence in the city of Bombay, and it's people and what wasn't new to me, it's heart!<br /><br />I look forward to more nail biting, intense intrigue, romance and spiritual transformation as David Gregory Roberts continues to unravel, weave and create through his storytelling.
B00005M91K|4.0|I think that Baraka is wonderfully filmed and the images and soundtrack blend together seamlessly. That said, though the images of people's inhumanity to each other are disturbing, what I did not care for is that most of the strongly positive images are of people praying, meditating or involved in some other religious activity, though it goes to the trouble to include all belief systems. Thus, the movie, not so subtly implies that faith is the answer to people's troubles, which a more secular viewer might tend to disagree with. It would have been more interesting if the images were more random and not put together to make a statement and able to let each viewer take away something else from it, as many of the classic experimental films did. Also the score tends to be somewhat new agey. Koyanaqaatsi, though certainly a message movie as well, had a driving electronic score by Philip Glass that held up on its own. However, for the imagery and cinematic experience that can be reproduced in your own living room I would reccomend this film
B0007OY2P8|1.0|This production was very disappointing. I can never figure out why directors & screenwriters think they can improve on the work of literary masters--they almost always come up with something more or less like this.  <br /> <br />Anyone who has read Jane Austen knows the delight of her dialogue. This version pretty much just throws it out altogether. It's more a trashing of \\"Northanger Abbey\\" than a dramatization.  <br /> <br />Here are some of the ways in which it fails: <br /> <br />- It concentrates on the gothic horror aspect of the novel, which was really a secondary plot.  <br />- The REAL theme of NA is about how Catherine, naive & genuine, gains maturity by learning from her social blunders. This was essentially lost in this production. <br />- Catherine's cute and funny personality, so strong in the book, doesn't appear here. <br />- Henry's humor is also lost. <br />- In fact, most of the humor is lost. (It IS a very funny book--really.) <br />- Isabella and John Thorpe are depicted as cunning, calculating plotters. In the novel, they are opportunists, but just aren't that smart. They only succeed because the Morlands are so naive.) <br />- Robert Hardy is made to play a ridiculous General Tilney. I resent the indignity to Robert Hardy. <br /> <br />WHY, WHY, WHY can't the producers, directors, etc. just follow the novel and use what Jane Austen wrote? If I could understand it at age 13, don't you think most adults could? <br /> <br />A true dramatization of the novel would be a delight. NA has the same light, bright, sparkling quality of Pride & Prejudice, and a loveable heroine both comic and nervy, for her time. It's a shame that there is nothing out there to represent NA but this disrespectful, unenjoyable production.  <br /> <br />The only thing I can praise about it is the fact that the story and costumes are set in the 1790s, when Jane Austen originally wrote its ur version, \\"Susan\\". There are several subtle points in the novel that make more sense in the context of 1790s Bath.  <br /> <br />(Please, BBC, do another version of this great novel, and do it more like the 1985 \\"Mansfield Park\\", where most of the language was Miss Austen's own.)
B000002BHE|5.0|One of the most stunning cd's I own, is Falling Into You.  It's so fantastic and has so many great songs on it.  You know how sometimes you have a great cd but you don't like all the songs on it?  Well for me, this isn't the case.  I love them all.  And considering this has 16 songs on it, it's a great testament on how great Celine is.  Maybe she doesn't write her own music, but she sings so incredibly well.   <br />If I had to pick my usual three best songs, I'd say they are If That's What It Takes, I Don't Know and Call The Man.  It's hard to narrow it down to only three good songs because they are all good.  There are her usual powerful ballads (Seduces Me, Because You Loved Me to name a few) and some more upbeat songs like Declaration Of Love and River Deep, Mountain High.  A really classy song is It's All Coming Back To Me Now.  It's 7.37 minutes long but it's amazing.  Yes I know some people can't appreciate her talent, but if you are someone how enjoys a powerful singer with a good range and ability, then this is for you.  It's so good and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|Given the trailers I'd seen and the creepy radio commercials I'd heard for this movie, I was expecting a fairly freaky viewing experience, yet I was also expecting to be let down, somewhat. Most times I'm expecting a movie to be disturbing, it turns out that the hype is highly overstated.     Silent Hill starts out and it feels as though they are forcing the storyline a bit.. It has a deliberate and unexplained feeling to it, which isn't necessarily bad- so I gave it a chance, but I wasn't hopeful. The daughter, Sharon, talks about Silent Hill while sleepwalking and the husband doesn't think to research it until after the mother, Rose, has already taken Sharon to find the mysterious town. Along the way, Rose ditches a cop who is attempting to pull her over - another plot point that seems unnecessary.     Ok, so Rose crashes the car and awakens to learn that Sharon is missing. It snows ashes in Silent Hill- and it appears to be uninhabited... or so it would seem... dun dun dunnnn.    Rose seems to be a bit too calm and collected while underground, looking for Sharon beneath the streets of Silent Hill. Finally, a freaky scene... Rose stumbles upon a man that has been disemboweled, but remains alive, hanging on a fence. Then, we finally see the \\"ghouls\\" of the mysterious town, as they close in and swarm Rose. They seem to be people made of ashes, if that makes any sense. The CGI is very apparent for these characters and I didn't find them to be particularly creepy or disturbing. Pretty cheesy.    The father follows, now a day behind Rose and Sharon, to Silent Hill. The movie gets stranger, but not too much more interesting. The pace is very slow. I realize that this was done deliberately, but it does drag along. The next good scene occurs outside of the church, as the townspeople who suddenly appear out of nowhere flee for refuge from the \\"darkness\\". The demon of darkness is a bad mofo, and this scene is gruesome, although brief.     Here, inside the church, is where the ridiculous story begins to unfold. A story of religious fanatics and claims of witchery. The story is eventually fed to you (done in replay style, where you're shown grainy footage of what happened in the town's \\"dark\\" past). This feels like a copout, as I was hoping this revelation would be far more dramatic.     The climax of the movie is gory and I would say it's pretty decent. The effects are also noteable, but I was honestly not impressed with the movie. I had a difficult time feeping my interest focused, even though this movie, I thought, would be right up my alley.
B000002AH7|2.0|I love Miles Davis, from his early days to most of his work towards the end of his career. But this album is really hard to like. The feel is orchestral; it doesn't swing. The compositions are forgettable and Miles' soloing is eclipsed by the weight of the accompanying orchestra. It's not that this type of effort couldn't succeed, but this one doesn't. Disappointing.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Bob Dylan's remarkable new album Modern Times is set against an apocalyptic backdrop of broken levees, broken dreams, and a \\"world that has gone black before my eyes,\\" according to at least one of this album's brilliant ten new songs. But if Dylan's got doomsday on his mind, the impending apocalypse he foresees seems to be as personal as it is biblical. <br /> <br />Bob Dylan has employed religious imagery in his lyrics at various points throughout his illustrious career. But unless I am wildly misreading the lyrics here (and I honestly don't think I am), the Modern Times Dylan refers to on this album mean nothing less than the End Of Days itself.  <br /> <br />This in itself should surprise no one. Dylan has always been a rather astute commentator on our times since at least his \\"spokesman of a generation\\" heyday in the sixties. And whether it's because of a Christian president fighting a \\"war on terror\\" against what are largely Islamic enemies (let's be honest here), or the biblical level disasters like Katrina we've seen in recent years, or any and all of the above, make no mistake. Apocalyptic thought has become a deeply ingrained part of the national, if not the global psyche. That someone like Bob Dylan would take note of this on his new record is again, hardly a surprise. <br /> <br />Still, this album contains some of the darkest, most overtly religious imagery Dylan has used since the Slow Train Coming days. But there is a distinct difference between then and now. While Dylan himself seems to be acutely aware of the impending doom of songs like the opening \\"Thunder On The Mountain,\\" the man we find here is not really so much the zealous fire and brimstone preacher of the infamous \\"Born Again\\" years.  <br /> <br />Well okay, there is the occasional biblical chastisement. Such as found in the line \\"Well I got up this mornin', see the rising sun return, Sooner or later you too shall burn\\" from Dylan's modern uptake of the blues standard \\"Rollin And Tumblin.\\"<br /> <br />Dylan similarly brings another blues standard into his Modern Times vision of doomsday with \\"The Levees Gonna Break.\\" Here Dylan sounds for all the world like a cross between Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker, as he implores his baby to \\"put on your cat clothes Mama, put on your evening dress, few more years of hard work, then there'll be 1,000 years of happiness,\\" in a line that seems to reference the future millennial kingdom of biblical prophecy. <br /> <br />More often though, what we find here is a broken down traveler who's made all of the usual mistakes such men make and is seeking redemption pretty much wherever he can find it. In this case, it means walking the usual tightrope between devotion and desire.  <br /> <br />On \\"Thunder On The Mountain,\\" Dylan's world weary traveler of the apocalypse's thoughts go from \\"wonderin where in the world Alicia Keys could be\\" to yearning for \\"some sweet day I'll stand beside my King\\" in pretty much an instant of time. Then, even as he seeks refuge from the \\"mean old twister bearing down on me,\\" the band puts a fine shine on the fact with a swagger that recalls \\"Highway 61\\" or that great forgotten Shot Of Love B-side \\"The Grooms Still Waiting At the Altar.\\" <br /> <br />In another of Modern Times best tracks, \\"Nettie Moore,\\" Dylan brilliantly puts into lyrics the delicate balancing act between the carnal and the spiritual within the very same song.  <br /> <br />On the one hand the traveler admits to \\"a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got no time to hide,\\" and then in the very next line declares \\"I'd walk through a blazing fire baby, if I knew you was on the other side.\\" Dylan's traveler then laments about \\"these bad luck women that stick like glue, it's either one or the other or neither of the two.\\" Clearly, this is a conflicted guy.  <br /> <br />Making matters worse is without his beloved Nettie Moore, \\"there's no one left here to tell, the world has gone black before my eyes.\\" Musically the song is instantly familiar sounding as Dylan wraps his words around a simply strummed guitar punctuated by an ominously metronomic bass drum. <br /> <br />With the apocalypse raging outside, the final track, the eight minute opus \\"Aint Walkin,\\" finds Dylan's beaten down traveler, \\"Walkin through the cities of the plague,\\" and that there \\"ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road.\\" Nothing is resolved as he confesses that \\"I am a tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others, but oh mother, things ain't going well.\\" The album itself likewise fades into the black of \\"the last outback at the worlds end.\\" <br /> <br />I don't know about you, but personally I'm game for a sequel.  <br /> <br />While Modern Times is being promoted as the final album of the trilogy that began with Time Out Of Mind and continued through 2001's Love & Theft this album not only stands completely out on it's own, but for my money is the best of the three. <br /> <br />Musically, the vibe is very similar to the other two albums in the so-called trilogy. Still, I personally find the mix here to be far more varied in terms of styles. Dylan's vocals here are also not only a lot smoother around the edges (though still carrying the bluesy croak of the other two), the phrasing here is just way sharper, perhaps reflecting the more thematic focus of the lyrics. <br /> <br />As for the lyrics themselves? I downloaded sixteen pages worth just to properly decipher them before writing this review. Dylan hasn't written stuff this darkly fascinating and evocative in years. Modern Times is a masterpiece that is right now easily the best record I've heard this year. Five Stars? Not to put too fine a point on it, but oh hell yeah. <br /> <br />Incidentally the bonus version includes a DVD which includes nifty live footage of \\"Love Sick\\" from the Grammy Awards (sadly with the infamous Soy Bomb footage edited out) and videos for \\"Cold Irons Bound,\\" \\"Things Have Changed,\\" and \\"Blood In My Eyes.\\"
B00005JNS0|1.0|Maybe this film is good for older kids, but my two kids (ages 4 and under) were bored to death. When I watched this film I could not help being turned off by it un-original concept. Cars stole just about every story\plot idea from the Michael J Fox film Doc Hollywood. So much so that I cant really see the point in watching Cars when Doc Hollywood was so much better. Personally for me and my kids this film was a major disappointment.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|The old man's still making good records every five years or so.  This set has similar themes to Dylan records of the last quarter century:  lost love, mortality and immortality, corruption, and (of course) revenge.  And it has the kind of rockabilly blooze and boogie that Dylan started recording in the mid-sixties.      After a couple listens I thought it was his best vocal effort since Oh Mercy! in the late eighties.  Dylan has eased back from that grating rasp he adopted on the last couple albums.  It's still pretty rough stuff, but if you're reading this you probably already know.  The record is rhythmically driven by Dylan's strange piano playing, which I really enjoy.  One small complaint is that Dylan fails to acknowledge borrowing a couple old blues songs, chorus and all (he sings beautifully on Rollin' and Tumblin' but changes almost nothing).  He's always borrowed tunes but at one time he would at least change the words!    Lyrics are plentiful but candid and careful, a genuine artistic effort.  Probably the mental landscape those lyrics project has become exotic in 2006, much like the old time music on \\"Modern Times.\\"  My early favorites are the opener, Beyond the HOrizon, and Nettie Moore.
B000C65Z20|5.0|This movie is a thought provoking exercise in conspiracy and reality drenched fiction.  It is a story that could well have been headlines all over the world.  The journey of an activist in Africa can easily be frought with danger.  Exposing a far-reaching conspicacy that compromises public health is a powerful subject.  One mans quest to uncover the truth and honor his dearly departed partner is a moving trip through the twists and turns of a complicated crime.  The coverup is something that could easily happen in real life.  It wouldn't be the first time that corporate greed compromised the public good.  While there is heartfelt vindication in the movies conclusion it is still sad.  There is no happy ending or lasting satisfaction.  But it is a grim reminder that courage no matter how worthwhile can get you killed in the modern world.  The value of human life is something that powerful people denigrate on a daily basis.  It is hoepful that this movie will strike a chord in the minds of the public opinion.  Question all motives at all times.  Keep a vigil out for the sick and helpless.  Sometimes a crisis in underdeveloped countries will go on festering for years.  It is on our watch that people everywhere should have someone to count on when there is a crisis.  The world owes those less fortunate to have a helping hand extended towards them.  This one man teaches a lesson we should never forget.  Always question those in power and hold them accountable.  Activism is a altruistic crusade that is much needed and deeply appreciated.  This movie makes you remember that and is must see viewing.  It is a sad reminder of what can go wrong in the modern world.  If only there was retribution more often in the real world.  For those who live in well-developed countries they have much to be thankful for and much to be expected of them.  Only when widespread disease and hunger are eradicated can we call this a civilized world.  Always be suspicious of those that profit from the plight of the poor man.  And never give up in the quest for truth and justice.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|\\"I got the porkchops, she got the pie<br />She ain't no angel and neither am I<br />Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes<br />I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams\\"<br /><br />Who else but Dylan can write stuff like this? The man who gave us \\"the ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face\\" 40 years ago continues to amaze.<br /><br />Modern Times is Dylan's best work since Infidels, and that's saying a lot. This is a great band, producing a new version of \\"that thin, that wild mercury sound\\" that is characteristic of Dylan at his best. Here it is polished, tracing a razor's edge, at times seductive, at times raising the hair on the back of your neck.<br /><br />It is remarkable what Dylan, at age 65, is able to do with his voice. To me it never sounded better. Yeah, I know his range is shot and that it's raspy and raw. But the phrasing is complex and precise, it hits every time, and the range of emotion that's conveyed is without compare. Nobody ever said that Dylan is an operatic singer, but he's an incredible vocalist, and Modern Times sets a new standard for this greatness.<br /><br />The songs flow together, contrast with, and build off one another. This is an \\"album\\" in the classic sense; buying individual songs or shuffling them will lose a lot.<br /><br />So for instance when the funky twelve bar rhythm of The Levee's Gonna Break transitions into the stark, haunting, slow chords of Ain't Talkin', you almost get weak in the knees, and the hair really does stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />And Dylan sings,<br /><br />\\"Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />Up the road, around the bend.<br />Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />In the last outback at the world's end.\\"<br /><br />Who else but Dylan does stuff like this?<br /><br />Just one thing. For the money more substance to the bonus DVD would be in order.<br /><br />Otherwise, highly recommended.
0060507772|4.0|I am a great fan of Terry Pratchet , especially of his Discworld series. That is to say that my opinion is a touch biased in his favour. However, I found 'The Last Hero\\" to be the ultimate beach side reading, especially when one contemplates about the \\"follies' of her/his youth.<br /><br />Mind you that I enjoyed the book sprawled in the sands of Antiparos ( a tiny Cyclades island next to Paros - just google it)and even if someone considers it \\"mass written- just another one Discworld novel\\" , it makes you take a good look at your potentials. Because gods , any gods, are nothing but our conceptions and therefore they are liable to regular updated versions of their  faiths.<br /><br />I hore that you will enjoy it.
B00005JP5J|1.0|Don't believe the hype, and don't believe all of these schmaltzy reviews. Little Miss Sunshine, which has been bolstered recently by ridiculous praise, is nothing more than a vacuous exercise in creating quirky characters. It is an ultimately meaningless film that relies heavily on \\"humanistic\\" humor that seems more reflective of films for teenage audiences. Toni Collette looks like she didn't sleep for a week. (Will she ever again generate the kind of performance she had in Muriel's Wedding?) Alan Arkin, as the coke-snorting grandfather who has been kicked out of a nursing home, is the only glimmer of light in this mess of murkiness. But, of course, his character dies mid-way through the film in order to go for the dead-body jokes. Juvenile humor--yea! Good grief! Oh, and the end is just awful. Let's throw in Rick James's \\"Super Freak\\" to have our Little Miss Sunshine dance to in the talent portion of the beauty pageant competition. It's not the acting that kills this film; it's the script: unoriginal, recycled, and puerile. You've been warned.
B000FUF6QS|5.0|THE WICKER MAN IS ONE OF THE TRULY GREAT CULT CLASSICS OF ALL TIME IT WAS FILMED IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES WHILE I WAS GROWING UP IN MY LOCAL DISTRICT OF WIGTOWNSHIRE IN DUMFRIES AND GALLOWAY IN THE SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND.IT TELLS OF A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN POLICEMAN LURED TO A REMOTE SCOTTISH ISLAND TO INVESTIGATE A SCOOLGIRLS DISAPPEARANCE ONLY TO BE DRAGGED IN THE END TO THE GREAT WICKER MAN ALREADY PREPARED FOR HIS SACRIFICE.THE WHOLE FILM IS WONDERFUL FROM BEGINNING TO END  BUT THE THE LAST SCENE WHEN EDWARD WOODWARD SEES WHAT HIS FATE IS AND THE FLAMES MERGING INTO THE DYING SCOTTISH SUN IS NOTHING LESS THAT PURE MAGIC.IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO VISIT THE DISTRICT WHERE THE WICKER MAN WAS MADE YOU WILL FEEL THE MAGIC AND WONDER THERE THAT IS CAPTURED FOREVER IN THIS WONDERFUL FILM. BY THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT ONE OF THE ABOVE REVIEWS THE FILM'S MAIN CHARACTER IS A SCOTTISH POLICEMAN NOT ENGLISH AND THE STORY IS SET IN SCOTLAND NOT ENGLAND THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES COMPLETELY.BUT ANYWAY PLEASE SEE THIS FILM FOR IT CAPTURES COMPLETELY THE PAGAN ATMOSPHERE AND WILL STICK WITH YOU THROUGH THE AGES.   <br />
B000GIWS7E|5.0|My wife and I just finished watching the entire video + documentary last night, in one sitting.  That should say something in itself.  I have been listening to DT since 1994, have all their studio CDs, and consider myself to be a moderately avid fan.  However, my wife of 6 years has only been a big DT fan for the last year.  I tried to introduce her to DT when we married, but she didn't \\"understand\\" the music and considered them to be not much more than noise.  What caused the change?  When did she start to understand and appreciate DT? .... It was when she watched the Budokan Video for the first time.  There is something about watching DT live, that helps you understand and appreciate them.  I consider the The Budokan and Score DVDs to be complimentary, with few overlapping tracks.  Video and sound in both are excellent, with Score being slightly higher quality.  Performances in both are excellent, with JLB's voice sounding consistently best on Score.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|That's because you don't need him. Dylan really needs no one but himself to write good songs and deliver them. And yes, having the touring band makes it that much better. \\"Only ten songs?\\" I thought. Ah, but these songs are lovely loose gooses that are just here to play a bit, and that can take, you know, five, six minutes apiece. So relax. So don't be afraid to jump on the railroad tracks and let your hair trail a bit in the salty breeze. Bob just ain't gonna let anyone get cynical on his buttocks -- uh-uh, not yet, or probably never again. He's still our prophet. Don't muzzle the ox that treads out the corn... Yeah, go ahead and buy this one and let it take you from an irresistable shufflin' dance-step energy all the way down to that loungy stuff when your poor old feet are tired. Four and a half stars is about right: no, not the stunner LOVE AND THEFT was, but almost anywhere \\"short\\" of that classic means the man is still the miracle we kinda hoped he was.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Simply the best . After decades or rockin' , the Eagles still preserve their signature tones and voices . If you're a fan if the classic Eagles , you're definitely gonna love this 3 hours combination of their greatest classic hits and brand new songs . i give it FIVE .
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't know what they're singing about most of the time, but Radiohead seem to take everything that's frustrating and unfair and wrong with the world and express it for the rest of us. Maybe that's the whole point. That whatever's going on in your life, whether you've been dumped by a woman you thought you loved because she's gone off with some other bloke, or whatever, you can find someone who gets it and can express it here. It's like a universal language of suffering. And when you find something else that understands, it makes that suffering easier to see, and put in perspective, and you know you're stronger for it, and that she's not going to win, that she's not going to have the last laugh, even if she is with someone else now, and she's happy and you're not. I don't need her anyway. I'm stronger than that. And one day, she's going to look back and think, why did I do that, why did I throw it all away? And she's going to be the one who's not happy. And I'll just smile and say, I'm sorry, but I've moved on now, and maybe I'll give her a copy of this album. And I can do that because of music like this. Thom Yorke is my wingman.
B00005JP87|2.0|The Illusionist presents the story of a magician's love affair with a duchess that has been promised to a crown prince in turn-of-the-century Vienna. The cast includes Edward Norton (Fight Club, Red Dragon) as title character Eisenheim, Jessica Biel (7th Heaven, Summer Catch) as love interest Sophie, Rufus Sewell (A Kight's Tale, Tristan & Isolde) as prince Leopold and Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Cinderella Man) as the city's chief investigator.<br /><br />In general, movies ask their audience to suspend belief for the short hours they spend in the viewer's chair. For the most part, when a movie is well made, it does not matter what the content as long as it is able to draw its audience into the world it has created and keep them there for the duration of the story. In this movie there is one major flaw: it cannot hold its audience captive. The words that the actors say, the clothes they wear, even the places they go all seem right but they fail in that one particular way. They fail to be real.<br /><br />Sadly, the female lead, and virtually only female character, is the worst of it all. Biel's acting comes across as mechanical and lacking true emotions. Maybe it is because she and Norton have no chemistry, or maybe it is because she should stick to fun but flimsy teen movie roles. Also, though it is quite obvious that both Norton and Giamatti are confident in their acting chops, and rightly so, it is hard to take either one too seriously when they are given such clich&eacute;d moments to portray. Even Sewell, usually the excellent bad guy, becomes slightly ridiculous toward the end when he rages over his crumbling world.<br /><br />The idea for this film is ingenious. A sort of displaced Romeo and Juliet, almost the love story of Titanic but with a little magic thrown in could have been a brilliant hit had it been properly executed. Unfortunately, despite the lavish costumes and dreamy camera work, nothing could keep this movie from being just not good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There is a reason this DVD boxed set gets a 5 star (perfect) rating! Everybody who sees it absolutely loves it!  Me included, and I'm not a fan of hardly anything on TV these days.  I was thoroughly amazed when I watched the series on DVD; amazed that someone actually dreamed up and created such a compelling, deep story, with such wonderful characters, actors, music, dialogue, everything! Then amazed that FOX cancelled it before giving it a chance to find its audience. Even though there are only 14 episodes and a movie (so far), you'll be amazed at how much detail, originality, depth, humor, adventure, warmth, love, family they packed into this story. This is the best entertainment deal ever because I am sure you'll love it too and watch these episodes over and over and over and over.  It will never get old...
B000GCFO0I|2.0|At the time of this writing the average rating on Silent Hill at Amazon was 4 stars. What a gip. If Silent Hill is a 4 star movie then something is broken. Either that or there are a lot of Horror movie fans with very low standards.<br /><br />Silent Hill isn't scary. There's no suspense. It's based on a cool video game, but it's about as believable as Donkey Kong (a stupid 80s video game about a gorilla that wears a tie).<br /><br />If you like good Horror [like Wolf Creek (2005) or the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead (2004)], or if you like good sci-fi [like Aliens (1986) or Terminator (1984, 1991, 2003)], you'll be bored silly by Silent Hill.<br /><br />Silent Hill is a dumb The Ring meets witches in the Twilight Zone kind of story that is not up to par with either of the media in my analogy.<br /><br />Paul S. Anderson [Resident Evil (2002, 2004), Alien vs. Predator (2004)] needs to write a book that aspiring video-game-to-film directors need to read that explains how to turn a good video game into a good movie. Because other than Anderson's films, I can't think of another movie that's been a good film adaptation of a video game.<br /><br />Pass on Silent Hill.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I was just turned on to this show through recent re-runs and am completely hooked. I bought the first season and watched all 9 episodes the first day it arrived and have preordered the 2nd season. The characters are great, I love the humor, and the plots are believable but defititely keep your attention.
0679735909|5.0|not the type of books I usually read (poetry and all) and it took me quite a while to \\"get into it\\" but it was worth it. the story is multi-layered and interesting and the whole book is wonderfully written. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />
B000002G6J|5.0|This is Jobim's finest album, although Stone Flower and Tide are certainly worth checking out.  The songwriting on this album is sublime, the arrangements are brilliant and the execution is flawless.  The melodies are minimal, yet strikingly elegant: they are small but very effective, impressionistic tone poems, each exquisite in its own right.    There doesn't seem to be a single misplaced or extraneous note on this entire album--it is as close to perfection as anything I've heard. Wave is really a beautifully crafted album in every detail.  I can't praise this album enough.  Listen to this.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Having been a Dylan fan for the past thirty years or so, I am amazed how creative and tireless Bob continues to be. Modern Times continues this tradition. It's a fascinating synthesis of American song-forms fused with Dylan's always-lyrical musings. The preoccupations that were first evident in World Gone Wrong (in which he described modern times as \\"the New Dark Ages\\") are prominent again: corruption and decay, the treachery of women, the dread of impending judgment, world-weariness and loneliness. Dylan borrows liberally from the blues and folk traditions to capture the moods perfectly. \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", for instance, echoes Robert Johnson's \\"If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day\\" and Muddy Waters \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", but bears Dylan's own distinctive twist. Bob Dylan is the Ezekiel of American music: a wandering exile proclaiming his prophetic--and sometimes quirky--visions to peoples who have lost their way.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|This is a pretty classic torch singer, with great pipes, singing Christmas songs.  Put it on your CD with a few other Christmas albums you love, hit random and you'll never be disappointed when Krall's songs come up.

B0006GAOBI|4.0|I watched the director's cut version twice and still couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie. Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't \\"get it\\" by watching the movie alone, I  say it is a failure on the film maker's part.     That said, I was intrigued by it. I guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks (I consider myself one) everywhere to this movie. When you finally \\"get it\\", it becomes a wonderful movie. Just one thing that still doesn't make sense though, when the jet engine (the Artifact) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie, doesn't it make it a Tangent universe? Doesn't the clock start ticking again, only this time, it wouldn't be Donnie who saves it.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Just got the new \\"Score\\" DVD and it is awesome. The camera work, lights, 5.1 sound is the clearest and best in any DVD by Dream Theater to date. I loved \\"Live at Buddokan\\" but this one is clearly the one to have. Every song features each member upclose & shows their truly god-given talent. This DVD covers the last 20 years of their music and proves that they are the Master of Progressive Rock. Get it, sit down & turn up the volume \\"Loudly\\" and ENJOY..!  <br /> <br />Michael Reynolds <br />Oakhurst, CA.
B000007R1M|5.0|This is probably Kraftwerk's best album ever. Every song was a superhit. Especially, the songs 'Robots' and 'Spacelab' - they used to play these everyday on TV in the morning news and aerobics programs. And this was in the mid 80s when I lived in rural India! Wow, I am engulfed in nostalgia now...
B000G759LW|4.0|Finally, some inspiration to walk into a record store again!  For so long listening to the same type of music on the radio, Pop, overproduced, commercial music.  At long last a little music with some soul, old-soul. Try this track \\"Hurt\\".  This album shows off what truly makes this artist shine, her raw talent, her amazing voice.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|From the very beginning, there is a problem with the film -- we are never shown a \\"normal\\" world so we never really have the shock of the new -- or abnormal. A little girl sleep walks to the edge of a cliff -- very close to her home. She murmers \\"Silent Hill\\" so of course any good parent would drive off to the town --- but WHY? We're never told. <br /> <br />After the child disappears in the town, you spent the next 45 minutes with the mother calling for her daughter. Yep. 45 minutes. \\"Sharon!\\" \\"Sharon!\\" \\"Sharon!\\" <br /> <br />Some \\"real\\" and computer monsters chase her (for no reason, no explanation). It gets dark for some reason every 10 minutes. Lots of yelling and running around, <br /> <br />Then the horrible and silly ending -- more screaming, barbed wire, \\"Burn the child! Keep the innocence!\\"  <br /> <br />Worst thing is we never care about any of the characters -- the mark of a lame film, horror or otherwise. <br /> <br />If they would have made this a QUIET horror film -- like the game -- and cut out all the running around (that's in the game, but this is a movie) it could have been a terrific and scary horror/mystery. <br /> <br />Stick with the game -- or rent SESSION 9!
0783116934|4.0|Just another comment that this is a much-better-than-usual made-for-TV movie. Quality acting by Rea.
B0002GTWQA|1.0|I saw this film, but didn't watch it; I was too busy marking the wild and incomprehensible mangling of the book's ideas and characters. <br />I should've been clued in to the direction the movie was taking when Brooks displays Jim's romanticism early on by showing the equivalent of a cinematic thought balloon: O'Toole grinning idiotically as a scene of him rescuing some shipwrecked vixen on a raft plays in the background. <br /> <br />Conrad's robust existentialism is probably impossible to convey in film, and the disclaimer, \\"Apapted From\\", while caveat enough, perhaps to some, should've read \\"Title Borrowed From\\" <br />since therein lies the only similarity. After the inquest scene the movie, already clumbsy, is a free and badly written improvisation. Think of an adaptation of 'Moby Dick' showing Ahab having a shoot-out with pirates in a saloon and then getting the girl. If the novel's ideas are like fully formed sentences, they are presented here as inarticulate half-words. <br />   <br />I know, the never was a movie made from a book that will please. <br />But this movie was not made from Conrad's novel, which really needs no defence as it, even with all its flaws, stands unassailable above this quotidian slander. So do yourself a favor and either don't read the book or don't watch the movie. <br />Apologies to Mr. Brooks, but this wasn't one of his better moments.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Starring Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, John Hurt, Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry  <br /> <br />It's the near future and the United States is destroyed by its own greed and all the wars it started. Our focus England has become a fascist state headed by a religious maniac. Gays are hunted and killed - and the Koran is outlawed. One poor gay television producer/host had a secret stash of outlawed art and he also had a Koran. Bad news for him. He's beaten to death by the not-so-secret police. You mustn't have a Koran. The symbol of the new regime is the double-cross.  <br /> <br />The powerful men in the country all made their money from drug companies. Where else? The drug companies are the great villains of the left - as if they don't hunger for drugs to cure them of their various diseases as do right wingers.  <br /> <br />Now this is a very good movie about revolutionary zeal in the face of oppression and I recommend it but I have strong intellectual reservations. We don't need to create a Christian, double-crossed, wacko fanatic madman leader of England when the Muslim fascistic movement is in full steam right now across the globe and they are the ones who already have these types of oppressive religio-manic societies. Gays? Where do you think a gay is safer? In a Margaret Thatcher England or in (pick one): Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iran, Iraq or in the communist states of North Korea, Cuba or the dictatorship of China? Where would you rather be gay?  <br /> <br />The movie suffers in my view with being way too knee-jerk leftist - as if blowing up England's Parliament, the movie's spectacular climax, means that \\"we the people\\" will have more power when in fact without the parliaments of the world, \\"we the people\\" usually get our buttocks kicked. And the drug companies! Are they villains again? Are drug companies the enemy of the people? I take drugs created by drug companies that have saved my life. They aren't villains to me or millions like me who arealive thanks to their research and development.  <br /> <br />Do we really have to fear the right wings of London politics when the true thugs are plotting explosions on subways and airplanes. The fascists who are about to take over don't use the double-cross as their symbol.  <br /> <br />In spite of all my objections, this is a stirring movie.  <br />
B00005GL0Q|5.0|The Beatles have their share of masterpieces (at least 5, by my count), but this is certainly their best on many levels -- quite possibly the best rock album made by anyone to date.  <br /> <br />The first thing that jumps out at you is the songwriting -- the briliance and variety are amazing. Lennon and Harrison particularly present some of their greatest ever compositions - ('She Said, She Said'; 'Taxman'; 'Dr. Robert'; 'I Want To Tell You') even though these aren't usually the ones you hear on the radio or greatest hit compilations. McCartney is no slouch here either, with some of his finest songwriting (the lovely 'For No One' and 'Here There and Everywhere').  <br /> <br />The second thing that grabs you is the brilliant production and band unity. \\"Sgt Pepper\\" and \\"The Beatles (White Album)\\" have these elements too, but \\"Pepper\\" doesn't rock like \\"Revolver\\", and the Beatles fragmented during \\"The White Album\\", morphing into great singer/songwriters using the other band members as backing musicians. Here the majesty of the Beatles is fully intact.  <br /> <br />Anyone who is discovering the Beatles for the first time and wants to dig deeper than the excellent Red (62-66) and Blue (67-70) albums should start here. An essential disc for any fan of great music.
0399208534|5.0|I normally do not care all that much for \\"pop-up\\" type books, as they tend to sort of come apart at the seams with constant use.  This one is differnt though.  It is well made and is able to stand a lot of use and abuse.  The story is great, tellin the life cycle of a butterfly.  The illustrations are quite colorful and very easy to follow and understand.  The text goes perfectly with the pictures and it is amazing how how the little one cannot keep thier fingers out of the many holes the caterpillar chews through on his way to becoming a butterfly.  This explains the life cycle of the butterfly.  I found, with my grandchildren, that after reading the book (time and time again) that when we captured a live caterpillar, gave it plenty to eat, and let it go through the entire process as shown in the book, they, the grandchildern were absolutely fascinated.  Recommend this one highly.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The summer of 1999, aged 15, was the day I felt my innocence shattered. I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to find out that it was a piece of garbage full of bad/flat, lifeless acting, a story full of plotholes and inconsistencies with the original trilogy and enough CGI to make your eyes bleed. <br /> <br />The actors, including heavy weights like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson, up and comers Natalie Portman, and gradually progressing into leading man status Ewan McGregor, are all wasted here. Neeson, McGregor and Jackson are OK but OK is all they are, but they don't stand out at all, nor does Portman. All I can say of Jake Lloyd is that he looks like he's having fun. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, ARGH. What was Lucas thinking? And poor Darth Maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him. <br /> <br />But what's most offensive of all, aside from the lifeless/passionless acting, are the continuity errors. All these years we were led to believe that Obi-Wan (McGregor) risked a lot to make Anakin a Jedi Knight, but here Obi-Wan's little more than a 2nd banana lurking in the background, while Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) is at the front line doing what he can to get Anakin ahead, and it's just wrong. That was what hurt me the most, the fact that the film wasn't about Obi-Wan, that it didn't adhere to previous Star Wars history. <br /> <br />And Episode 2, alas, isn't that big of an improvement.
0930289528|4.0|One of the latest gritty, dark graphic novels to be adapted to film was \\"V for Vendetta,\\" based on Alan Moore's futuristic comic of the same name. But as usual, the source is the most compelling.<br /><br />First published in the early 1980s, Moore painted a frightening future where there is only one man who can challenge the fascist system. Is he an anarchic madman, or a freedom-loving visionary? Readers will have to decide for themselves, but the story is a fascinating action story that raises quite a few questions.<br /><br />The year is 1998 (okay, pretend it's an alternate reality), and Britain is ruled by a fascist regime, and dominated by a shadowy figure. Order is the law. Blacks, gays, Muslims and Jews are relegated to concentration camps, where they are tortured with medical experiments and evil priests. The one exception is a horribly scarred man, who blew his way out with a homemade bomb. He donned a Guy Fawkes mask, and calls himself V, for he \\"has no name.\\"<br /><br />One night he rescues a young prostitute, Evey, from a bunch of thuggish policemen, whisks her down into his hidden base, and involves her in a trap-and-murder plot. Evey is both repulsed and fascinated by V's plots, especially when she is interrogated. And when an order-obsessed policeman closes in on V, both he and Evey must accept their fates.<br /><br />\\"V For Vendetta\\" is a thinking-reader's comic. Fascism and anarchy -- both concepts that Moore clearly understands -- are timeless concepts that pop up periodically throughout human history. So even though 1998 came and went long ago, \\"V For Vendetta\\" is an intelligent, deeply compelling story that still resonates in its readers.<br /><br />Moore's London is a rather dank, dismal place, apparently reflecting the government. He knows how to chill his readers with a diversity-free England that seems a lot like Nazi Germany. Even nonessential scenes like Evey's interrogation are absolutely harrowing. But he can also tug at the heartstrings, such as when Evey reads Valerie's letters.<br /><br />And Dave Lloyd's artwork is rather flat and a bit faded-looking, though this is not very distracting. But despite the ordinary art, the novel is brought to life by the solid characters and surreal illustrations, with V as the most surreal of all -- just look at that creepy smiling mask.<br /><br />At first glance, V is a vigilante hero in the tradition of Zorro -- the government is oppressive, and he's trying to take it down. But V is not a plaster hero, and his actions can be very morally ambiguous. Is he a hero or a madman? Did those experiments make him psychotic, or did they just give him courage? Moore leaves it up to our imaginations what he is. By the end, V has become less a person than an ideal.<br /><br />\\"V For Vendetta\\" is a memorable, somewhat frightening graphic novel, which will leave you thinking about what you might do in such a world.

B00005QB42|4.0|I found the music to be healing. You will feel more connected with humanity as it has a multicultural beauty. Enchanting use of voice and unique musical instruments.
B000GPIPVU|4.0|This album is most certainly of equal quality with his previous release, \\"Trouble.\\" Ray seems to be evolving a little with his sound. Not expanding outward with it, as many breakout artists often do, Ray flourishes inward on this beautiful sophmore album. And with wonderful results, as nothing of his artistic vision has gone astray.    Not outside of Mark Eitzel (and American Music Club) has such a warm and capable voice trembled seemingly on the verge of an emotional breakdown. Yet Ray is not as straightforward with his wounded and crooning rasp, he redirects his emotional energy into music supremely. Low key though the album may be, the music is somehow very accessible and darkly pleasant. This no doubt comes form Ray's smooth, captivating voice. It is as though he is hoarse with his love of music-- breathing life over his gentle strumming and instrumentation.    Ray also has an overall glitter, a pleasing aesthetic. The melodramatic effect every one of his songs posesses may be a bit much for some. It also might be easy to mistake this for his sole musical talent, or that perhaps he is predictable. Do not be surprised if critics point out this quality of his sound- the observation is passive at best.     Whatever your musical preferences may be, don't be afraid to let Ray's music touch you. He is a rare songwriting talent, and an amazing new voice. His rising popularity reflects an ability to connect so fully with the listener- as much as he himself is immersed in his own music.    Key tracks: \\"Empty,\\" \\"Three More Days,\\" \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\"
B000F7CMRM|3.0|George Clooney seems intent on educating us with films that aren't accurate enough to be documentaries or dramatic enough to be truthful.  In Good Night, And Good Luck he made one of the most truly horrifying chapters in American history, the McCarthy era, tepid and drab.  In Syriana, (star and executive producer), he blows the whistle on corruption in the oil biz.  (Who knew?)  Can a searing indictment of shady Hollywood accounting practices be far behind?<br /><br />Syriana is long and plotless, instead of structure or character development there's a maelstrom of plot-ettes which occasionally bump into each other and say, \\"Excuse me.\\"  The cinematography is excellent, and it's fun to bounce from Langley to Beirut, Switzerland to luxury yachts in the Mediterranean.  But it doesn't add up to anything.  The net result is a feeling of being lost in a terribly intricate web, a network of people who have only one thing in common, they're all despicable.<br /><br />If nothing else, Syriana vividly reminds us that myopic greed is an equal opportunity employer that does not discriminate by race, religion, culture, gender, nationality, or any other artificial parameter people use to separate themselves from one another, and in so doing, sew the seeds of destruction for one and all.  Those who imagine our own country as somehow especially virtuous - and the sand dune strewn nation states we exhaust to propel our bloated SUVs as merely a necessary evil morally inferior to us - will have to look elsewhere to perpetuate their ludicrous prejudices.  In this respect Syriana is pretty compelling propaganda, and certainly needed.  However, propaganda is never art.<br /><br />The film is something of a cameo-fest, one gets the sense that lots of Hollywood liberals jumped on the bandwagon to lend support, but no character is developed fully enough to allow for a real performance.  Jeffrey Wright as Bennett Holiday comes closest, but even Clooney, hidden behind a nasty beard, offers no depth or feeling.  Matt Damon, true to form, gives yet another impression of a loaf of Wonderbread that has learned to talk, while William Hurt's obligatory stroll through the scenery is so lackluster that anything - finger puppets, PowerPoint slides, even a mime - would have been preferable.<br /><br />Watch it, then go fill up your Hummer.fers no depth or feeling.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|These comments refer to the Two-Disc Special Edition (DVD): <br /> <br />In 1966, John Frankenheimer set out to make a racing movie unlike any racing movie made before [or since in my opinion] - and succeeded magnificently... He sent the actors to race driving schools, so when you see a close-up of James Garner in a formula car with the streets of Monaco receding behind him at speed, it's not on a sound stage with a projected background, it's taken with a camera mounted ON the car, and that IS James Garner, and it IS Monaco, and they're going pretty damn fast.  <br /> <br />I originally saw it in Cinerama in Los Angeles, and about the only things that don't survive \\"shrinking\\" very well are the opening scene (where you realized you were looking down an exhaust - just as the engine started) and Frankenheimer's many-image mosaics - they're just too small to have the same effects.  <br /> <br />Frankenheimer's racing scenes were taken during the 1966 Formula 1 season, in the two days following each race, so the backgrounds are completely authentic (except the 1966 Italian Grand Prix didn't use the Monza high banking...) He had his own fleet of F3 cars - each modified to look like a specific F1 prototype, so that the \\"Ferraris\\" LOOK like Ferraris, the \\"BRMs\\" LOOK like BRMs, and the \\"Yamuras\\" look an awful lot like F1 Hondas. <br /> <br />It's fun to see *real* F1 drivers (Phil Hill, Graham Hill, Ritchie Ginther, Dan Gurney, (all credited - and I thought I saw John Surtees) appearing in the background, some with a few lines  <br /> <br />On top of automotive competition (winning, losing, accidents, mechanical failures, injuries, recovery) there are two or three sub-plots - basically \\"who's sleeping with who\\" - which pretty much can be be ignored.  <br /> <br />The sound track and DVD transfer are excellent, with a bit of *faint* light vertical striping appearing in a few scenes.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I can't believe this movie is not already out on DVD!  There are so many bad movies that come out on DVD and this one is so good, makes me wonder who makes the decision to print or not print them.  Like I find myself saying about many other things in life, \\"If it was up to ME....!\\".
032147404X|5.0|I have never written a book review before but after reading almost the whole book in one day I had no choice but to give my opinion. I just received this book today 01 Sep 2006 and I can't put it down.  It covers so many aspects of shooting in various modes and makes it simple enough for me to understand. I use a Canon 5D and 20D and have been into photography for about 6 months.  All I can say is that I have looked at several books and read several online forums and tutorials...etc.  This book covers everything I need to know to get that WOW factor out of my shots.  Scott Kelby you are the best and this book is more than GREAT.  When does \\"BOOK 2\\" get released....Anyway, I hope others that get this book enjoy it as much as I do.
0812550757|4.0|This was a fascinating, generational story of life on Lusitania, where humans have come into contact with the second sentient beings--the piggies--since the xenocide of the buggers in Ender's Game.  Feeling guilty, the Starways Congress decides to allow xenologers to study these aliens and live among the Catholic colony on Lusitania.  When two xenologers die at the hands of the piggies, the old calls for war ring again but instead of an armada, the Speaker of the Dead is summoned.  Andrew Wiggin, Speaker of the Dead, sets off for Lusitania where he hopes to repair the lives of two of families on Lusitania and solve the mystery of the piggies.  <br /> <br />This story is VERY different from Ender's Game, and yet it succeeds in many ways.  The very idea of a Speaker for the Dead is incredibly moving and to have Ender, the slayer of the buggers, fill this role proves even more powerful.  The dramatic effect he has on Lusitania is enough to declare the book a triumph.  However, the culture of the piggies is at the heart of the story, and the gripping mystery of the xenologer's deaths, when resolved, will not disappoint.  Card really doesn't need to continue this series; I can't image a more fitting ending.

0307276902|5.0|I read A Million Little Pieces before the big Smoking Gun controversy.  I always assumed that Frey's story had been fictionalized (at least a little) to raise the intensity of the story (although not to the extent it actually was).<br /><br />If you haven't read A Million Little Pieces because it isn't a an actual memoir, I suggest that you disregard the controversy.  The hype around this book was well founded, regardless of whether it is a true memoir or not.  Frey draws heavily on his own experiences as an addict but obviously realized that the `real story' of his rehab lacked the necessary drama.  Frey punches things up with a dentistry torture scene, a forbidden romance, and a daring rescue from a crack house.  The fictional Frey has an edgy darkness: he's misunderstood - he's a bad-boy. The real Frey, on the other hand, appears to be something of a screw-up with a weak character and low self esteem (and yet, a talented writer).<br /><br />The bottom line is; Frey has written a great novel.  Despite the liberties taken with the truth, Frey understands what it feels like to be an addict.  His unusual writing style, with its lack of punctuation, repetition, and free flowing narrative are well suited to the story.  I found it to be powerful, compelling, and raw when I first read it (and thought it was mostly true).  Knowing now that A Million Little Pieces is mostly fiction hasn't changed my opinion of the book.  James Frey has written a great first novel. Forget the controversy, believe the hype, and read this novel.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Slayer may not be a bunch of certified musical geniuses, but that's to their credit: the certification process blunts the edge that makes this band great.  This album obliterates at high volume.  It takes no prisoners, with simple but perfect riffs and expert solos amidst a relentless force.  A bunch of \\"old men\\" show the rash of over-educated guitar heroes that the important thing in metal is to keep the raw sound despite sophisticated composition and production. <br /> <br />This album probably violates European blasphemy laws, showing at least one way that America does better than the rest of the world.

B0009H1CK6|5.0|Excellent! This is a very well produced, slick, and entertaining DVD. Great audio, great camera work, and Nile Rodgers at his best. The girls are very talented, and Sylver Logan Sharp can be a star in her own right. Aside from a somewhat lengthy bandmember intro, there are no \\"low-lights.\\" This DVD should be the standard that all music DVDs are modelled after. So get this DVD and... \\"Leave your cares behind...\\"
B00005J6T0|5.0|\\"True Blue\\" makes it three-for-three for Madonna, now residing at the forefront of the public awareness as if she'd been there forever. <br />Honestly...isn't it now difficult to remember a time BEFORE Madonna? You sort of automatically jump back to either disco or Led Zeppelin. <br />Anyways, she continues to grow as an artist and singer, while trying some new pop flavors on for size. <br />\\"Papa Don't Preach\\" is one of her typical, awesome pop songs, but in what has become sort of cliche for her, intentionally provocative. Seeing the furor caused by \\"Virgin\\", she found it necessary to tweak our sensibilities with each subsequent record...at least once. (Think \\"Like A Prayer\\", the \\"Justify My Love\\" video, the whole \\"Erotica/Sex\\" thing...) <br />But the song has a killer melody, great drums and keyboards, and she sings so enthusiastically...you're hooked. <br />\\"Open Your Heart\\" is even better. This is a great song, backwards and forwards. The synth lines and chord washes back up her soaring vocals. <br />\\"White Heat\\" is a sort-of failed attempt at melding the whole Jimmy Cagney thing to a pop song. <br />Ah...but with \\"Live To Tell\\", first heard in the great flick, \\"At Close Range\\", Madonna nails her first epic ballad. Man does this still sound good. Mysterious, moody... <br />\\"Where's The Party\\" is yet another dance club anthem guaranteed to get people on the floor at any party. Most great pop songs are fairly simple and direct, as is this. Lots of fun. <br />\\"True Blue\\" goes a bit further than \\"Shoo-Be-Doo\\" in showing off her fondness for the girl groups of yesteryear. You can't deny it sounds sweet on the radio though. Again, simple and fun, with a catchy melody and bouncy tempo...what more should you ask for? <br />\\"La Isla Bonita\\" adds an exquisite Latin flavor to a \\"Madonna\\" song, and it fits like a glove...for many, the highlight of the album. <br />\\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" is the one forgettable, skippable tune on the set. I can instantly hum every melody of every song on this album, but I can never recall this one. <br />My personal fave is \\"Love Makes The World Go Round\\". It's not deep. It's not particularly original in lyric, but it has this little Caribbean flavor to it's uptempo sequences, and the chorus just destroys me every time...and Madonna sings her butt off during the bridges... <br /> <br />The nice remaster includes two additional but unnecessary remixes. <br /> <br />If you have either of the first two albums, you'll need this one.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I've always loved this film. I remember watching it at Christmas time every year since I was a little kid. You would think I would get sick of it. Far from it. The scenery, the settings, the charaters, but most of all the MUSIC. Watch this and you'll be humming certain songs for days. The casting here is spot-on. Julie Andrews will forevermore be remembered as Maria, the troublesome nun who attempts to be a nanny to seven children. Christopher Plummer is great as Captain VonTrapp, the aristocratic ex-navy captain, who rediscovers the importance of music and love in life. The children are wonderful. Each of them does just the right job with their roles, and of course they sing beautifully. The cinematography is beautiful here, as the background setting of Austria is so vividly captured on film. This film transferred beautifully to DVD, with wonderful clarity and sharpness, and the film has never sounded better. I've reviewed many classic films, and I've enjoyed them all, but this one has a special place in my heart. Get this for your collection, it's truly worth it.
B000002LGQ|4.0|I'm in the minority, but \\"Like A Prayer\\" isn't the top-to-bottom masterpiece suggested by other reviewers. <br />Not to say there isn't a lot here to like...there is...and some of it ranks amongst her best recordings ever. Shoot, \\"Express Yourself\\" is one of the great singles ever, by anyone. <br />But there's a few things that go wrong here. <br />First off, is that for the first time, she takes her voice to places she's not ready for yet. Listen to this, then \\"I'm Breathless\\", then \\"Evita\\" and then \\"Ray of Light.\\" Her voice, during certain passages in \\"Like A Prayer\\", gets wobbly. There's a range of notes she tries to hold and can't. It's the same octave she can't hold in \\"Promise To Try\\". And she's shrill in \\"Spanish Eyes.\\" <br />Second, is that some of the songs aren't the knock-it-out-of-the-park pop classics we've come to expect. <br /> <br />But those are relatively minor points. <br />\\"Like A Prayer\\" is a justifiably lauded pop anthem, but it stills pales in comparison to the epic \\"Express Yourself.\\" This song sounded awesome the first and five-hundredth time you hear it. <br />But \\"Love Song\\"...a Mount Rushmore meeting of two of the decade's...nay, the century's...music icons, Prince and Madonna, results in a ho-hum, minimally melodic time waster. <br />On the other hand, as confessionals go, it's hard to expose yourself any more than \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\". Man, if this ISN'T about Sean Penn...then Madonna is a way better actress than we ever expected. <br />\\"Promise To Try\\" is a weak \\"Live To Tell.\\" Nuff said. <br />\\"Cherish\\" is another magnificent pop achievement...easy on the ears, simple and fun...and the video just plays in your head forever. <br />I love \\"Dear Jessie\\". I think it's cute. It's almost a kids' song...with pink elephants and lemonade, \\"la-la-la's\\" in the background, and calliope-like synthesizers. <br />\\"Oh Father' is another tease; how autobiographical is she getting here? As a song, strictly speaking, it's not much...but it sure is interesting to listen to and armchair analyze. <br />\\"Keep It Together\\" sounds like an outtake from the first two Madonna albums, and that's a compliment. <br />\\"Spanish Eyes' is kinda awful, and \\"Act of Contrition\\" is an added-on, edited-together sound collage. You'll never listen to more than once, I guarantee. <br /> <br />The CD is desperately in need of a remaster. <br /> <br />But by the sheer number of songs that are unavailable on her compilations, you're gonna need to get this one too...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It seems uncanny that one of the best sci-fi television serials since Star Trek would also be the downfall of sci-fi television which even ended up with Star Trek being cancelled.  The reason why we don't have anything new these past few years is apparently because of the low-ratings sci-fi television has been receiving. With 14 episodes produced, and only 11 aired, Firefly was cancelled by FOX in December 2002. However cult DVD box set followings (yeah this one) caused FOX to produce a movie version of the Firefly series called Serenity. Firefly is a cross between Star Wars and The Magnificent Seven. The shows creator, Josh Whedon (of Buffy the Vampire fame) had finished reading books about the Battle of Gettysburg and the American Civil War, combined the immigrant colonization elements with space pirates, a spice of Whedon whit in the script and a renegade crew on the ship Serenity with some state of the art special effects (Lucas could be forgiven for believing that his beloved ILM had been working early mornings without his knowledge) delivering on some cool stories for a show that deserves all the hype it has been receiving. In short if you own a DVD player, got the price for any box set, you will be getting value for content and then some more. This is like 10 hours worth of some of the best sci-fi you will ever see along with some of most hip characters to grace the television screen. The stories are all downright fab.

B00005J6SZ|5.0|With her second album, Madonna exploded into the popular stratosphere, and deservedly so. Expertly produced by Nile Rodgers, with the best session musicians on the planet, Madonna here staked her claim as being the number one music star on the planet with staggering confidence.<br /><br />Yes, her \\"boy toy\\" image and slinky, lingerie-clad cover shot may not have aged well, but there is no denying the genuine pop thrill of that kick-drum explosive opening to \\"Material Girl\\". That song's terrific video will still probably play in your head, but this remains one of the great singles of that era. And as much as you would NOT like to admit it, it was one of those pop songs that kids and their parents could both like.<br /><br />The album continues with \\"Angel\\", a song that seems so much better now than it did back then...beautiful strings, an irresistible beat and vibrant vocals by Madonna. Most impressive.<br /><br />Not much more can or should be said about the song, \\"Like A Virgin\\", but listening to it after all these years with fresh ears...it's a monster song with only one goal: to top the charts and dominate radio/MTV. Which it did. Handily.<br /><br />\\"Over and Over\\" is the overlooked gem of the collection. An awesome uptempo track that'll have you dancing in your seat as you head down the highway. The melody sticks with you like a virus. Check out that sweet guitar threaded throughout the tune.<br /><br />\\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" is her first, and almost successful, stab at an epic ballad. She'd nail it later in her career with other songs.<br /><br />\\"Dress You Up\\", for me, is a junior version of \\"Over and Over\\", but it is yet another nearly perfect pop song on an album nearly made up of nothing but.<br /><br />What's worth mentioning here is that Madonna still has a limited range, but she's consciously expanding it, and never pushes it needlessly. She knows her vocal limits, and finds settings to best show it off.<br /><br />\\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\\" shows her interest in \\"retro\\"-style tunes, something she'd master with \\"True Blue\\" and in another sense, the entire \\"I'm Breathless\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Pretender\\" and \\"Stay\\" still sound like filler to this day, but pretty tasty filler nonetheless.<br /><br />This excellent remaster adds two dance mixes of the biggest hits, but they're just an additional bonus. The real treat here is getting a chance to listen to one of the decade's highlights in exquisite fashion.<br /><br />A necessary addition to any serious pop fan's collection.
0790731452|4.0|This movie is extremely funny all the way through with only a few dud jokes along the way. The aliens look really cool and they're mannerisms and vocalizations are nicely done. Jack Nickolson makes a great crazy, wacked-out, off-the-wall president. (This, however, was more funny back when the movie first came out since now, with Bush Jr. in office, this might be a little too close to reality for comfort.) Much of the special effects are quite nice also. A guest appearance by Tom Jones is also a nice treat. If you like quirky spoofs along the lines of the Scary Movie series or the Airplane Series, then chances are that this movie will work for you.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|First off, I will try to avoid Floyd politicking for either Gilmour or Waters, or comparison to David's work with Floyd, by himself, or any other solo works by the Floyd. David has said that this is his most personal work, and therefore I will attempt to review it on its own merits. <br /> <br />This album has a significant number of strengths, and I will try to give each of them their due. First, of course, David's abilities with a guitar are completely undiminished, and the riff on the title track, as well as that on \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" rank right up there with \\"Comfortably Numb\\". Also, David does not limit his virtuosity to the guitar; he shows off his skills with a variety of other instruments such as saxophone and Hammond organ. He is complemented by an excellent array of guest musicians, among them one Richard Wright. To cap it off, \\"Island\\" is excellently produced and one feels transported to the island Dave's voice and guitar creates. <br /> <br />However, for every great feature of this album, there is an even greater flaw. The first and foremost of these is the lyrics, most of which are credited to David's wife Polly Samson. They suffer from a lack of imagination (Take a breath/Take a deep breath now), pretentious romanticism (One day he'll slip away/Cool water flowing all around/In the river and on the ground) and sheer awkwardness (Let the night surround you...) <br /> <br />Although the guitar, which is after all David's forte, flows smoothly, towards the end of the album it one gets the feeling that they've already heard that riff before. Also, one does not notice much the work of Wright and other session musicians, as their pieces tend to get processed into oblivion, possibly out of fear by David that he will be upstaged. Instead, he deprives the listener of great complements to what he calls his best work. <br /> <br />The music itself is very soothing. Songs such as \\"The Blue\\" and \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" are sooooooothing to the point that they make one want to close their eyes for quite a long time. This aural, New-Age sound David has embraced makes rockers such as \\"Take A Breath\\" forced and out of place. I wish I had more experience with New Age music, so I could take a stab at comparing it to its own genre. <br /> <br />Now for the obligatory run-through of the different songs on the album. \\"Castellorizon\\" is a child of Dark Side of the Moon's \\"Speak To Me\\"; it samples all the upcoming songs, and does a quite good job of it at that. It merges flawlessly into the title track, which features an excellent melody and even more: some halfway decent lyrics. However, all the momentum Gilmour has built up is lost on \\"The Blue\\", which features the worst lyrics on the album (and that's saying a lot) as well as tiresome instrumentation that makes one drift off until woken up by the simply awful beat of \\"Take A Breath\\", which almost made this reviewer turn off the album in disgust. David slightly redeems himself on \\"Red Sky At Night\\", whose simple, pleasing sax lick is not ruined by Samson's lyrics. \\"This Heaven\\" has David expressing joy in the simple pleasures of life, yet he somehow makes it sound forced and overbearing. \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" is another instrumental which features Gilmour using whatever doot-dooing is left over from live performances of \\"Wish You Were Here\\", although it doesn't keep the listener grooving quite like \\"Red Sky\\". Then it segues into \\"Smile\\" an acoustic song, which depending on the listener is either a simple love song or an over-sweet, unimaginative ballad. \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" features some nifty guitar, yet the lyrics manage to sound like a positive spin put on a critique of Gilmor's personality by his rival Waters. \\"Where We Start\\" finishes the album with abysmal lyrics and guitar parts stolen from the title track. <br /> <br />Overall, I found this album rather disappointing and unsatisfying. Whether you will like it depends on a few things: first of all, just how relaxed youlike your music; those who rely on music to keep their blood pumping would be well advised to stay away. Floyd fans looking to this as the Next Best Thing to a reunion will be sorely disappointed as well. It's best if you lose all expectations you have before you get this album. I say give it a chance, whether you like it or not depends on just what kind of person you are.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|They've completely ruined the trilogy by making this film. The Phoenix kills 3 of the most important X-men and adds a bunch of fake ones? Great idea.  Let's alienate the fan base that made the first two films a hit and go for that Barb Wire demographic. Um, no.  Bad idea. They made Juggernaut a mutant and he goes along with the program... have the producers/writers/director ever read an X-men comic? People that have seen the movie that didn't know about the story seemed to enjoy it.  I hope this kind of crap doesn't happen to the Spiderman series or the next of the Batman Begins films.  Hollywood always seems to ruin what we love... just give them time. The original Batman movie was good... then a few movies later the biggest piece of crap ever made, Batman Forever, arrives.  Will you guys ever learn?
B00007FOMP|5.0|More than any musical record I know of, this one shows what popular music can do.  It stretches and pulls listeners to imagine a better world, and it does it through an aching admission of weakness and self-doubt, and yet a series of visions of what just might be possible.  And the amazing thing: Gaye does this through a series of songs, poetics, calls, wishes, that melt and groove into one another, sometimes like honey, sometimes like hot asphalt.  There may be other musical moments equal to this, but there are none better, and certainly none more completely humane.
6305558167|5.0|Bernard Cornwell is one of that rare breed of authors who are able to write convincingly on a broad range of subjects. Present day thrillers, the Sharpe novels about riflemen in the days of the Duke of Wellington, even an  ancient historical novel about Stonehenge and it doesn't come much more ancient than that. His more recent novels have been about the Saxons and very good they are too. But I think that the trilogy he has written about the Arthurian legends are certainly among the best, if not the best of his novels. Having visited the authors website he also believes they are the best books he has written. <br /> <br />The legends of King Arthur hold a magical attraction for many people, myself included and I enjoy reading about them very much. The tales of Arthur and his knights of the round table riding about in full and shining armour are of course a total nonsense and a more or less modern day depiction of Arthur. Suits of armour were not even invented until several hundred years after Arthur's death, if indeed he existed at all. But if he did it would be more around the time in which the Winter King is set. <br /> <br />Mr. Cornwell puts a more realistic slant on the existence of Arthur in or around the sixth century, and the author himself believes that Arthur was some sort of war chief rather than a king. <br /> <br />The last book of the trilogy is the continuing story of war. It begins with the failure of Lancelot's rebellion and the ruination of Arthur's marriage to Guinevere. The Saxon hordes, although subdued have never been completely defeated and sensing unrest  they gather their war bands together for one final assault on Arthur and all he stands for. However, Arthur gains victory at Mount Badon, but all of the promises he made are coming back to haunt him, after many years of peace and contentment.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|If you are looking for deep thinking Science Fiction this is not the film for you. Go read a Heinlein, Card or Cherryh book, you will be happier. If you want to turn your brain off for a few minutes, this movie is a lot better than I imagined it would be. Charlize is beautiful. The action isn't half bad, and the special effects are really quite good. The story is... well it's not exactly literature, but as I said if that's what you are in the mood for, there are lots of great books out there.<br /><br />If you are standing at the video store asking yourself, Aeon Flux or UltraViolet? Rest assured Aeon Flux is your better choice. This film is not \\"Aliens\\" by a long shot, but it isn't half bad. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!
B00004WIDQ|5.0|JURASSIC PARK is one of the best, if not the best, movies made about dinosaurs ever.  It's also one of only a handful of movies ever made based on a novel that was already in preproduction before the novel ever was released.  It's also one of the first movies to use CGI in significant scenes throughout the film.  It's also the movie that gave Sam Neill a break and reinvigorated the career of Jeff Goldblum.  The movie (promoted by the release of the novel about a year earlier) got the general public (and not just kids) excited about dinosaurs again and did to paleontology as a major what RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK did to archaeology.<br /><br />The premise, seeped in pop science, is that a multi-billionaire, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) brings dinosaurs back to life by cloning the dino-DNA taken from mosquitoes trapped in amber.  He builds a zoological theme-park he calls Jurassic Park.  However, in order to call off a bunch of lawyers after an accident with one of the park's workers, Hammond has to get a group of scientific experts to endorse that the park is safe and viable.  Thus, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) arrive to tour the facilities.  Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello), are also along for the ride as test subjects.  Due to a hurricane and the shenanigans of a greedy employee, the park experiences a major breakdown and the dinosaurs get loose.<br /><br />JURASSIC PARK set records upon its initial release in 1993 and it isn't difficult to see why.  The CGI effects that have become common in just about every movie since then were in their infancy then, yet the creatures appear completely lifelike.  Of course, Spielberg not only used CGI but he had some live action dinos and models involved as well.  It was a massive undertaking, but one that had a huge payoff.<br /><br />There's not much to complain about with JURASSIC PARK.  Sam Neill is great as Dr. Grant (the role was originally offered to Harrison Ford and I'm actually glad he turned it down) and Jeff Goldblum is almost always a delight to watch on screen.

B000BBOUU4|5.0|The ultimate storyteller of current postmodern society does it again. Tim Burton does it again. \\"Charlie and the chocolate factory\\" a film written by John August and Burton himself, is the 2005 adaptation of the legendary Roald Dahl's tale.  <br /> <br />Faithful to the traditional \\"bizarro\\" aura that has become his film trademark, Burton manages to deliver a moving and beautiful story with a strong ethic & value-oriented message that will be the joy of kids (all ages) and adults (all ages too). A feast for the eyes, and the soul. Exhausted and somewhat bored of his own success, Willie Wonka, the obscure owner of a world-class chocolate factory decides that the time has come for him to find an heir to his creamy empire. In doing so, he decides to temporarily leave his usual secludeness and issue a worldwide contest by way of which five lucky golden tickets, hidden in an equal number of chocolate bars, will in turn allow five lucky kids to tour his mistery factory, and get the chance of winning an all-star prize \\"beyond their imagination\\". After a series of unthinkable and (at times) very dark situations inside the factory, four pitiful kids fail the test. Each of them consumed by gluttony, greed, arrogance and despise. Only one child, the pristine and humble Charlie Bucket, manages to complete the journey, earning the coveted prize, and ultimately giving Willy Wonka the lesson of his life.  <br /> <br />I have to say that I loved this film so much that I even forgave Tim Burton for making his Willy Wonka a Wacko-Jacko look-alike....but hey Tim, don't push it!
0743454537|3.0|I wouldn't call Picoult a great writer but the book kept my interest and was a fast read. I read it because my two teen-aged daughters did and they loved it. The question of whether is is moral and fair to have a child for the sole purpose of saving another is surely a topic worthy of exploring and this book might open up that topic for a book group. The book seemed a little too simple to me (such as the predictable character of the older brother, Jesse)and it did not develop the character of Kate (the ill child) very well. The relationship between the attorney, Campbell, and the guardian ad litem, Julia, seemed forced, predictable and trite. There were two surprises in the end. The mother was the most tragic figure of all; even the ultimate solution would surely haunt her the rest of her days.
0684800713|3.0|The only thing that saves this overrated plotless story is its description of the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain towards the end of the book.  Otherwise, it is racist, deeply anti-Semitic, and sexist.  The words nig-er and ki-e are used, while the female protagonist sleeps with anyone she chooses.  The male protagonist, Jake Barnes, is apparently impotent and thus, is left to taking care of Lady Brett Ashley without any of the pleasurable rewards.  Don't look for a plot, there isn't one.  The book is simply a recitation on what expatriates did in Paris and Spain after World War I.  Hemingway's style is clear and succinct, but definitely overrated.  Robert Cohn, the Jewish character in the book, is continually degraded and disdained.  And what about the 30ish Brett, Lady Ashley, the female hero?  She's so beautiful all the guys want to sleep with her, including a 19-year-old bullfighter.  Although I admit some of the descriptions of the bullfighting are valuable, I really don't understand why this is considered a respected literary work.  When I read a book, I want a story and memorable characters.  This has neither.  Needless to say, I find Hemingway one of the most overrated writers of the past century.  Hey, I'm sure many of you will disagree, but if you want my opinion, don't waste your time on this twaddle.
B000001FS3|5.0|'The Joshua Tree' has to be one of the top three classics by U2.  At the time critics needed to catch up to this incredible masterpiece.  (Perhaps their reputation as a Christian rock band made them too easily dismissed.)  It covers many themes related to the struggle of man in his most desperate circumstances.  Musically, it is transcending like 'The Unforgettable Fire' before it, but the crystal clear production taken on again to more pleasing effect by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno shot this album and the band to superstardom.  All players are more accomplished, and the music is more varied.      Passion is rock's hallmark, and U2 harnessed passion like few bands have.  That's why the throbbing \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" is one of their most enduring classics.  Throbbing with troubadour musicianship and sincere, longing lyrics, this song became to the summer of '87, what \\"A Little Help from My Friends\\" was in the summer of '67.  \\"With or Without You\\" also hits the mark with almost as much passion and all the universality.  Then, humankind is sung for on \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" and the angst of \\"Red Hill Town\\".  They cover the agony of South America torn by the superpowers with the Led Zepplin influenced \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\".  Then, U2 manages to slow it down on \\"Running to Stand Still,\\" a brilliant portrait of drug addiction and desperation with tight musicianship that expertly proves you don't have to be loud to be passionate.  The second half, if anything, is even more brilliant.  \\"In God's Country\\" is a more lively and succinct diagnosis of the desperation of modern people than \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" is.  \\"One Tree Hill\\" is a beautifully eloquent elegy for a fellow slain musician.  Then, \\"Exit\\" is a remarkably frenetic and disturbing portrait of struggling despair.  They end the album as they began with \\"Mothers of the Disappeared,\\" another portrait of human right's victims.  The quiet angst of that song is somber, yet disturbing.  Oddly, as uncompromising as the subject matter was on 'The Joshua Tree,' they managed to get hordes of new followers.    'The Joshua Tree' is still a great album.  It is passionate and showcases a variety that scotches any blueprinting that can be found to a minor degree on their other albums.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|I didn't go into this movie with high hopes.  Too many \\"video game to movie\\" movies out there suck.  In saying that I was actually pretty suprised with Silent Hill.  I tryed playing the game but found the only time I had to play it was at night alone and that wasn't happening so I never finished.  However the atmosphere that I found in the game definitely made it to the movie.  I won't bore everyone with a run down of what happened, instead I'll tell you why it was a decent, yet not great horror movie. <br /> <br />Why it was decent: <br />+ Very very creepy atmosphere at all times, whether the \\"darkness\\" had come on the town or it was just seeing the town in the fog, or even in the real world <br />+ The monsters were definitely unique and scary(mainly due to the fact of how disturbing they were) <br />+ Plenty of disturbing backdrops with bodies wrapped in barbed wire etc. etc. <br />+ Decent acting <br />+ Interesting camera angles and lighting effects that seem to have come straight from the game. <br />+ A lot of emotion tied in which you don't see in horror movies.  It wasn't just screaming and being scared, it was also being sad and brave(which would have been better if we got to really know the characters) <br />+ At parts it was almost pyschological in the way it'd scare you.   <br /> <br />What keeps this from being a great movie: <br />- There's WAY WAY too much yelling of \\"Sharon! Sharon!\\" throughout the movie.  It got very very old.  I know she's looking for her daughter, but come on!   <br />- They made the evil girl look too much like the girl from The Ring meets The Grudge.  I would have liked to have seen a bit of originality <br />- Not enough characterization at all.  You never really get to know any of the characters.  We couldn't really sympathize with the mtoher because we didn't know her, we didn't know her daughter.  Couldn't sympathize with the husband because we were never allowed to get to know him.  We were never able to TRULY hate the towns people because they were never TRULY introduced to us.  IF there's going to be a sequel then they should have done a better job letting us know who the characters were, that is the job of a first film by the way, not the second. <br />- And the ABSOLUTE main reason that the movie falls into the three star catagory.  Lots, and I do mean LOTS of unanswered questions.  How did she find her self in this dream world?  Who exactly are the monsters?  Where did they come from?  Why are they after her?  What exactly is the darkness?  How is she supposed to get out of this dream world?  And the list goes on and on and on and on.  I hate when a movie ends and there's so many questions left open.  That's a true sign of poor writing in my book.  Can't think of how to bring everything together?  Just leave it like it is and let the audience imagine what happened.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Like so many others writting a review here for Dylan's latest, I have been touched on the heart from his music that has left a lasting print. You get no different from this album with \\"Modern Times\\" exceeding expectations. On this album you have fun with Bob, you laugh with Bob, you cry with Bob. And this is simpily because this man shares his soul. Enough said.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This trilogy is great. I wished I got this when it first came out. This trilogy DVD box set is worth every penny you put in to it. It's like watching the todays Star Wars movies!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Anamorphic refers to a technical process for mastering a widescreen film to DVD. It has NOTHING to do with the age of a film or with digitally altering a film. Google it and read up so you understand why people are upset. The VIDEO TRANSFER is the issue, not the actual content of the film.  <br /> <br />People don't understand about film to video transfers. Films (even films that are 75 years old) have a higher resolution than even HD video. That is just the way it is no matter the age of the film. That's why a good transfer of the Wizard of Oz can  look stunning 67 years later. Video has been trying to catch up to film resolution for years, that is what HD is all about.  <br /> <br />A film to video transfer done in 1993 used 1993 video technology, which was not nearly as good as current HD technology and WAY below the resolution of film. Films to video transfers today are very close to capturing the full resolution of film.  <br /> <br />Because they are shot on film, the Star Wars films have ALWAYS had full film resolution, even in 1977. Fans want to see them as they were in the theater, in high resolution and which a 1993, non-anamorphic video transfer CANNOT provide.  <br /> <br />So this release DOES NOT reflect how the films really looked when they were released. It reflects how home video looked in 1993, not film. Couple that with non-anamorphic transfers (which results in a 15-20% LOSS of picture detail to the black bars) and you have a VERY substandard release.  <br /> <br />A new transfer of the original films (with NO digital tweaking, just a direct film to video transfer) could EASILY have been done to provide a crystal clear, HD level DVD release. This is what is done with even the most mediocre DVD releases. You can get an anamorphic, HD level transfer of Gigli for crying out loud. <br /> <br />As for the sound issue, all 3 films were originally released with 6 track Dolby Surround, which can easily be transferred to a Dolby Digital 5.1 track. It's done all the time. <br /> <br />So before you judge, understand the real technical issues here. Lucasfilm is purposely releasing low quality, sub standard video transfers of these classic films. I can't tell you WHY, but they are. <br />
B000001FA4|5.0|'Unforgettable Fire' is a shimmering and passionate masterpiece.  Perhaps it is only slightly less brilliant lyrically as 'The Joshua Tree' and at times uneven, but the propulsive energy, the celestial production, and the flowing imagery make this C.D. one of U2's very best.    The familiar ground deserves mention.  \\"Pride,\\" a remarkable tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King is majestic with the Edge's guitar ringing out sonorously and Bono's vocals and Larry's drumming meeting and surpassing the demands of the challenge.  \\"Bad\\" is another great anthem.  It works into a throbbing crescendo, then leaves us satisfied.  The title track is mesmerizing in a way that hardly is muzak to our ears.  Existential and sociological in its implications to spirituality and nuclear annhilation, it provides food and music for thought.  The unheralded songs are accomplished, too.  \\"Wire\\" is as frenetic and tense as they get.  It is simply one of their greatest songs, driven to bring home a first-person drama--a subject from \\"Amnesty International,\\" whom they support.  They bring home more sublime spirituality with \\"Indian Summer Sky\\" and the meandering, but excellent \\"Elvis Presley and America\\".  The opener \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" is an excellent diagnosis and another worthy anthem regarding the \\"quiet desperation\\"* of modern life.  Then, the album needs some tenderness to avoid overdrive.  \\"Serenade\\" is beautiful masterpiece as is the reprise-like closer \\"MLK\\".  \\"Fourth of July\\" is evocative of Bono's statement that \\"America both fascinates and frightens me.\\"  It is a short intermission on the threshold of \\"Bad\\".  On the previous 'War' U2 looked at the world, but specifically at Ireland.  On 'The Unforgettable Fire'they look at the world especially at--or through--the eyes of America.    The energy of their early years was matched and surpassed on \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\".  The lyrics are nuanced, yet direct.  Bono was certainly reaching maturity vocally and lyrically on this album.  The Edge reaches playing heights and intricacies found no where previous, and Adams bass is more expert, throbbing ably through the mix.  Larry's athletic drumming is one of the most idiosyncratic accomplishments one can think of.  Then, the perfectionistic production of Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, newly at the helm, provide a beautiful synthesis of the music.  Perhaps 'The Joshua Tree' represents more variety and maturity, but the propulsiveness of 'The Unforgettable Fire' is a hallmark achievement.    *Henry David Thoreau
B000002I99|3.0|Historically this is a better Alice Cooper cd b/c (I think) he made worse and worse stuff as time went on. After 1978, he was a parody of the once great artist that he was in the mid 1970's.<br /><br />\\"Only Women Bleed\\" \\"Some Folks\\" and \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" are all good songs but, they are not even close to the quality that he did when Alice Cooper... the band was together. When compared to \\"Love it to Death\\" \\"Killer\\" \\"Schools Out\\" and \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" this is a very lesser, embarassing work.<br /><br />Remember, this was originally a raucous Detroit act compareable to The Stooges, Amboy Dukes and MC5. This was a Vegas lounge act by now. He would have been an MTV darling with this packaged  lame excuse for rock music.
0671027387|4.0|After reading The Da Vinci Code I found Dan Brown to be an intelligent and note-worthy author. I enjoyed his fast pace and on-edge style of writing. After The Da Vinci Code, I read Angels & Demons which I thought was just as good if not better. Deception Point, being the third I've read of Dan Brown's novels has by far been my favorite of the three. This book was hard to put down, I wanted to keep reading more to see what unfolded next. Although, I pretty much already had a good idea how the story would end about three quarters into the book. Dan Brown writes wonderful books, but I have found it quite simple to predict the endings of Deception Point, Angels & Demons, and The Da Vinci Code nearly half-way through the novels. I still rate this book 4 stars because it was a very exciting read, but I wish the author would make it a little more difficult for the reader to unfold the conspiracy before the main characters.

It's incredible that someone can so intimately know the dog's mind.<br /><br />Read this book and you'll have a greater appreciation for your dog!<br /><br />She uncovers how we ignorantly misread and mislead our canine companions.<br /><br />An enjoyable and easy read.

B0000024UX|5.0|How exquisite are the two most celebrated songs from 'Bridge Over Troubled Water,' Simon and Garfunkel's greatest album and worthy of a top ten list of pop/rock music.  \\"The Boxer\\" and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" deserve their reputation for their hair-raising excellence.  The build up, the beautiful vocals, and the orchestration are magnificent.  Less heralded is the album's versatality.  The exotic rhythms of \\"El Condor Pasa\\" and \\"Cecilia\\" are expert.  Then, there are the quieter gems, like \\"Farewell to Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" the tender \\"The Only Living Boy in New York,\\" and the closer \\"Song for the Asking\\".  Simon and Garfunkel aren't simply substantial, they are playful masters.  They ably incorporate jazz with \\"Keep the Customer Satisfied,\\" complete with excellent lyrics that concicely evoke themes from 'Death of a Salesman'.  They even have the irreverence to poke fun by wearily blurting out \\"Enough, already!\\" after their tribute to Frank Lloyd Wright.  (Maybe it was all allegory and tongue-in-cheek anyway, but it works well in any case.)  Not only are they playful with \\"Cecilia,\\" but with the lively \\"Baby Driver\\" and \\"Why Don't You Write Me\\".  They even have a super live version of \\"Bye Bye Love,\\" as if they were lacking any confidence.      'Bridge Over Troubled Water' is easily a top ten pop/rock classic of all time.  It isn't just filled with ethereal classics; it has all the components of a remarkably varied masterpiece.
B000002JSN|5.0|This was a critically panned album when it first came out. Led Zep fans showed disappointment b/c this was much more diverse and challenging then the previously revved up blues and folk songs. Over time, the brilliance to this challenging album has fully emerged.<br /><br />There were no immediate fan favorites. This album took patience to get used to and sink in. \\"Kashmir\\", the darling, classic radio song of today was not that prevalent in the 1970's.<br /><br />In hindsight you can see how the masses improperly categorized this band as a \\"hard rock\\" band. This band left other similarly LOOKING bands like Deep Purple & Black Sabbath in their dust. Led Zep was so much more complicated, diverse and daring then the others.<br /><br />Over the years, most of the songs found themselves and therefore there are no obvious standouts. \\"The Rover\\" is the most like a typical tune off of Led Zep I or II. \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and \\"Custard Pie\\" grooves as good as anything on Stax records. \\"In My Time of Dying\\" has the majesty of an extended \\"Stairway\\" song. \\"Boogie with Stu\\" actually has a perfect title to describe it's sound.<br /><br />Unlike their other works, you can get lost in the creativity and diversity of all the different songs. This could be put in your cd player and 2 weeks later your still discovering hidden melodies, rythms and drum patterns.<br /><br />I liken this to to a Stanley Kubrick movie where you do not quite \\"get it\\" at first but then it grows and develops on you for a richer affinity.<br /><br />There are some flaws for some of the songs but that is what makes the album all the more better. The un-evenness is more artful and adventurous then a bunch of 3 minute radio friendly songs.<br /><br />A big giant thumbs up!
B00000DC10|5.0|The aptly titled, The Shape of Punk to Come is a amazing cd. Its fast, furious, creative, and a true lesson in what makes punk music good. This album really was ahead of its time, and years later it's still incredibly addictive. I didn't hear this album untill last year, but even now it still sounds fresh and as good as it was back then.<br /><br />I think The Shape of Punk to come is one of the most creative albums I've ever heard. This is punk done perfect. Catchy lyrics, rife with what you would probably expect from a punk band. Its unfortuante that these guys broke up shortly after this album, because I would love to have heard what they might have come with next. Even tho the lead singer went onto the band, International Noise Conspiracy, while good, they don't match the intensity or have quite the same magic that made Refused so special. If your a fan of punk music, go get this now if you don't already have it. Its that good.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|The bottom line is that this is another great Dylan album.  I'd agree with what most have said, which is that it fits nicely with Time Out of Mind and Love and Theft.  If you like his newer stuff you'll definitely be pleased.  His vocals still sound good, and there are some great melodies here.   <br /> <br />My personal favorite so far is Workin Man's Blues #2, which is beautiful and well written. Buy It!
B000FS9FCG|4.0|This review is written for those that have already seen the movie, with the intention that they may consider reseeing it. This story was a just the retelling of the Matrix, the story about control. Here however the a fascist government took the place of the machines. The themes of choice, integrity, and causality were the driving force of the characters. No action is without a consequence. Hence it would be prudent to consider the consequence of our actions rather than our feeling towards them, because are feeling can be manipulated. The Wachowski brothers do an excellent job of showing how every character in movie including V struggles with doing what they wish rather that which they know to be right. We can see how easily characters such Creedy are tricked by V because they are driven by their anger. The most powerful part of the movie for me was V coming to realization with the consequences of his own actions, and giving up control for what he had worked so hard for to Evey, since she represented the people who have to live with consequence of his actions.  <br />My only problem with movie and why I gave it 4 stars was that V forced the Evey the transformation process by torturing her. Yes she may have suggested in an attempt to win her trust that she wanted to be free of her fear, but that should have been her choice no V's. It would have been nice if their was more of a genuine desire expressed by her to free of her fear. Perhaps it was by forcing the process on Evey that V discovered that he was forcing this revolution on the people, rather than giving them a choice in the matter.  <br />At the end this movie is not just about governments. It is about all those who which to control people, how ever noble their intentions are or pure their believes are. It is that warning that such action is not without consequence, and that universe will eventually break through and will not be stopped no matter how much energy you generate. I hope you will take the time to see this movie again.  <br />
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is a perfect album...and I am not even a big Bowie fan! Sonically, production wise, musically, the arrangements, the pacing as well as the strength of the songs...this is a brilliant work.<br /><br />Every song is famous so I cannot give you a highlight. Every song is different yet great. \\"Five years Ago\\" is a great opening number and \\"Rock and Roll Suicide is a perfect closer to the album<br /><br />This is not a singles cd but rather should be listened to from start to finish. This is on par with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" or any other great album from the era.
B000G759LW|5.0|I don't know if I would say I've actually been a real Christina fan. When I was younger, I liked her first album. Of course after the whole bubblegum pop era faded, so did my liking for her. I purchased her \\"Stripped\\" album, & kind of enjoyed it. But it wasn't on repeat in my stereo, on the top of my 'album-of-the-year' list or anything.    Then I heard all the hype about her new album, and her newly found maturity. I previewed it for myself & couldn't believe what I heard. I instantly fell in LOVE with this CD, with its genius and creativity. I love the way she combined R&B, some pop, rap, but mainly 20's, 30's, and 40's type of music.     There is so much to be said about \\"Back To Basics.\\" The production is incredible. I love just about every song, and even the ones that were alittle too pop for my liking, which weren't that many, grew on me. She pours her heart into every song with that beautiful voice of hers, and you can tell theres a story behind each one. I can say that this is her BEST album to date, I just LOVE IT.    MY personal favorites are:     Save Me From Myself - (I love the way she almost whispers it while she sings)   Hurt - (very emotional...love it)  I got trouble - (I love the way they made it sound old-fasioned)  Mercy On Me - (soulful)  Oh Mother - (love it...)  Understand - (love the beat, and the lyrics)  Without you - (LOVE the lyrics)  The Right Man - (THIS IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD, WHAT A GREAT WAY TO END THE ALBUM. I LOVE THE INSTRUMENTS USED, THE BEAT AS A WHOLE, THE LYRICS AND THE EMOTIONS THAT STREAM FROM IT...IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND I GET ALITTLE EMOTIONAL MY SELF!)    I like all the other ones too, these songs just came to the top of my head the quickest.     Point is, get this album. And yeah, this is going to be on repeat in my stereo for a loooong time to come.
B0002IRY0O|5.0|If you are used to thinking of Celibidache as an enigmatic, glacially slow conductor, this box of Bruckner performances from DG will be an eye-opener. It dates from the Seventies, before the maestro's more eccentric inclinations set in completely--his tempos are anywhere from 2 to almost 10 min. faster in various movements. (In some places, such as the finael of Sym. #7, the tempo may actually be faster than the norm.) Here are a few comparisons with the Bruckner box set released by EMI, all with the Munich Phil. --  No 7 - Stuttgart 67', Munich 79'; No 8 - Stuttgart 84', Munich 102'; No 9 - Stuttgart 59', Munich 77'. The Stockholm and Stuttgart orchestras aren't as proficient as his own Munich ensemble, but they sound fine, as does DG's good FM radio sound, despite the fact that overall textures can be a bit thin and the treble a bit harsh.<br /><br />The Gramophone reviewer speculates that Celibidache adopted such uncharacteristically fast tempos in Stuttgart because the orchestra had learned Bruckner under their previous conductor, Hans Rosbaud, a dedicated modernist whose style was swift, lean, and unsentimental. Be that as it may, measuring Celi by the metronome isn't fair. The real question is what he offers musically, and there's no doubt that he is closely attuned to Bruckner. Long passages are carved like marble; the atomosphere is often full of mystery and poetry; sonorities are built on a massive scale and then give way to intervals of lovely serenity. This is music made alive on the page. Compared to Karajan, another great Brucknerian, Celibidache is more organic and relaxed. One can quibble with things here and there, but then an entire stretch of music, such as the opening of Sym. #3, will emerge as a magnificent whole.<br /><br />The only listeners who might be displeased are those who have bought into the Celi mystique during his later years; for them, if the pace isn't agonizingly slow, the true magic isn't happening. I'm not sure I can erect an altar to Celibidache's entire career, but these Bruckner recordings seem great to me, even if they are shockingly normal.<br /><br />P.S. - I have a twinge of guilt that I may have oversold the virtues of \\"normal.\\" Every interested listener should hear Celi's late Bruckner from Munich at its best, as in a sublime Sixth on EMI, before deciding which style is preferable.ar to Celibidache's entire career, but these Bruckner recordings seem great to me, even if they are shockingly normal.<br /><br />P.S. - I have a twinge of guilt that I may have oversold the virtues of \\"normal.\\" Every interested listener should hear Celi's late Bruckner from Munich at its best, as in a sublime Sixth on EMI, before deciding which style is preferable.
B00005JMXX|5.0|This is the kind of movie that is perfect to watch with the whole family. Pop the popcorn and get ready for an adventure! I watch this movie over and over again and I'm never bored with it. It has all the makings of a classic disaster film: you care about the characters, it's just predictable enough to draw you in and keep you watching. The cinematogaphy is awesome and the special effects keep you on the edge of your seat. The cast was excellent and I can hardly wait to pop this movie into the dvd player and watch it again...Loved it!
B000002C2E|5.0|This album was no \\"shocker\\" to those of us who have continued to appreciate Bob Dylan as the most relevant cultural voice in America...since the early-sixties, enduring periods of directionlessness and bemusement--but always with at least one eye on integrity and eros. The two albums of recrafted standards and obsurities that preceded TOOM were superb (with World Gone Wrong a masterpiece). The hysterical response to TOOM was from those who hadn't been paying attention--and it was embarrasing.The transparent hyperbole was obviously to compensate for the audiences own failures. And, alas, they compounded it with a new failure: blind to the pain and alienation that permeates TOOM and to the inconsistency of the result. TOOM certainly contains three masterpieces--Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway, and Trying to Get to Heaven (and maybe a fourth, the epic Highlands). But, it also includes three very bad songs/performances: Million Miles, Dirt Road Blues and the absolutely dreadful (and out-of-place to boot) Make You Feel My Love. While TOOM's two successors, \\"Love and Theft\\" and Modern Times may not have a singular masterpiece between them, they are both superior records. \\"Love and Theft\\" particularly, with it's pastiche of American life from the Civil War to the Present is a unique creation in the history of American Music, the work of a man who is making a committed effort to come to terms with his lifetime of experiences and his status as an elder among us. TOOM resists and laments, Modern Times boasts and poses,nearly frozen in time and place; \\"Love and Theft\\" is the record that embraces age and the ages, that celebrates the ways in which culture, geography and tradition sustain us as they rob us of our freedom and wild nature. Time Out of Mind brings us to the mirror and shatters it. It's successor repairs that mirror. As it does so it drags us through to the other side and encourages us to look back without fear, but with creativity and courage--Lot's wife's fate not withstanding. Buy 'em all.

B000094P4U|5.0|This movie has it all, great screenplay, actors, set, costumes, extras, direction and cinematography. Everything appears to be set in the correct time period. And does a very vivid job portraying of the Eighteenth Centaury in the Amazon Jungle.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons plays a Spanish Jesuit who goes into the South American wilderness to build a mission in the hope of converting the Indians of the region to the Catholic Religion. He professes Christ's love and does not believe in violence. Robert DeNiro plays a slave hunter who is converted and joins Irons in his mission.<br /><br />The Jesuits are successful in getting the natives out of the jungles and into what become very successfully ran Missions. At this time Spain does not allow slavery, but Portugal does. And a Cardinal is sent to the region to determine whether or not the Jesuit Missions should stay under the protection of the Church or be given over to the Portuguese; which would men slavery or death for the natives.<br /><br />Of course we see what great work has been accomplished in these missions as the Cardinal tours them. And he knows that these missions are not only God's work. But an exemplary model of what we should all strive for. There is a great moment in the movie when the cardinal is in the Mission Church deciding if he should follow God's will or do that which would be best for the Church in Europe.<br /><br />We will be shown both those who follow God's will and those who follow the desire and greed of men. As another reviewer has said here, the themes of this film are universal, but particularly pertinent to Catholics and others of faith who are called to evangelize the world and succor the poor and disenfranchised. Questions of the meaning of authority, obedience, justice, mercy, the morality of violence, true faith and charity are all raised and plumbed here, and anyone watching this film will be enlarged for it, I think.<br /><br />This is a must watch film...and you will want to see it more then once. So I recommend you buy it.t to see it more then once. So I recommend you buy it. <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|if you just want hard, riveting simple expressions of music, don't delve into any tool at all. however, if you truly like listening to each layer of each song and nonsong track and enjoy breaking a sonicular code to truly understand the often complex meanings of each track, buy it. it'll be treasured for years.
B00005R1N3|5.0|Count me as in on the bandwagon with the glowing reviews below.<br /><br />This criminally overlooked horror gem is one of the scariest movies I've seen, up there with Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA and at least as scary as movies that borrowed from it, including WHEN A STRANGER CALLS and HALLOWEEN.<br /><br />In fact, I'm surprised I've gone as long as I have without seeing it. Don't read any plot spoilers. A great film for the Halloween season. All the actors are good in their roles, the pacing is tight, and the viewer is drawn in immediatewly (unlike with many 70s flicks). The movie wastes no time getting down to business. Great stuff.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|This album is pretty wack. Music of the Sun was a much better album and was more directly connected with her roots. This album was more of her trying to crossover in the pop world, but she sucks when it comes to ballads. \\" Unfaithful\\" was the only decent ballad on the CD. \\"We Ride\\", S.O.S.\\", and \\"Dem Hatas\\" are the best tracks. \\"Break it Off\\" should have been on Sean Paul's album because its basically his track all she does is sing the bridge and hook. Rihanna, if you want to keep your \\"colored\\" audience, use the formula for Music of the Sun and stick to it.
B00004YW6I|5.0|This is one of the best albums in Polly Jean's oeuvre. For the first and only time, she reveals the happiness and hearbreak of a relationship, which is the main concept behind the song cycle. As a result, the production is unusually polished with soothing guitar textures and more relaxed vocals. Her next album, \\"Uh Huh Her,\\" goes back to the stripped down indie rock from her earlier works. She begins with the brilliant high-voltage assault of \\"Big Exit\\" and quiets down in the gorgeous \\"One Line.\\" PJ Harvey ends the album on an ambiguous note, signaling an end to her reverie in New York. Overall, I recommend this album as the most accessible and second only to \\"To Bring You My Love.\\"
B000GFLKF8|3.0|First off, the plot is REALLY good! <br /> <br />BUT WHY WHY WHY must Spike Lee make racism a part of everything he does? All this movie is really trying to state to the viewer is that highly successfull White Collar workers are the \\"real criminals\\" and their criminal actions are what got them their power. <br /> <br />It is just mind boggling to me how Spike Lee can't make 10 minutes worth of film without adding simple forms of anti-white or \\"feel sorry for the minority\\" sentiment.  Every successfull person in this movie was white (ie bank owner, Jodie Foster's character etc) but they were all \\"real criminals\\". <br /> <br />Had a normal director made this movie and removed or edited the unnecessary Arab parts, the white cop saying \\"spic\\" and being intimidated by Denzel to say \\"African American\\" instead of black it would have been much more enjoyable. When have you EVER heard an African American refer to another person as an African American. If it accepted, and only accepted for African American's to call each other \\"blacks\\" or \\"Nig**s) then that is simply a form of racism in it self.    <br /> <br />When will people finally realize the only way to put racism behind us is to forget the past and stop modern segragation such as BET, Asian Channel, African American only Universities and Fraternities, African American only scholarships, etc. When you make race an issue, it becomes a deciding factor. <br /> <br />I just don't like to pay $7 to be fed some racial propaganda.
B000002B2X|5.0|If you're an Alice in Chains fan this short EP is essencial for you. There are some pretty good tracks on this. Even the hidden track is pretty \\"interesting\\".

Got Me Wrong - 10/10<br /><br />3. Right Turn - 8.5/10<br /><br />4. Am I Inside - 9.5/10<br /><br />5. Bonus Track 1  - 8.5/10<br /><br />Overall: 91% A-<br /><br />This is pretty much just a nice album to own if you enjoy the bands music or find it for real cheap somewhere as I did. It's good for what its worth being a short but sweet EP.
0399208534|5.0|This book is one of my childrens' favorites.  From the time they were both too little to know their days of the week they still chimed in when the caterpillar ate and ate and was \\"Still Hungry\\" until they could say the days of the week with no problem, this book will forever be a staple among my families' collections.  The illustrations are Eric Carle's usual terrific array of colors and creatures. This book is also great for nursery school teachers to read and explain to their children the beautiful transformation from caterpillar to butterfly by using live caterpillars as an educational tool.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is probably one of the best albums the 90s has to offer. The entire album is a masterpiece from start to finish. There isn't a single track from the record that I don't enjoy. No, not every song is amazing but there isn't one time I want to switch tracks while listening. When I picked this up a while back, not sure what to expect, and only going off what I heard on the radio I was skeptical. My skepticism was quickly changed to joy after hearing this. My favorite tracks from this album are probably \\"Rain When I Die\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\", \\"Hate To Feel\\", and \\"Would?\\". Here's the ratings for everything...<br /><br />1. Them Bones - 10/10<br /><br />2. Dam That River - 10/10<br /><br />3. Rain When I Die - 10/10<br /><br />4. Down In A Hole - 10/10<br /><br />5. Sickman - 8.5/10<br /><br />6. Rooster - 9.5/10<br /><br />7. Junkhead - 10/10<br /><br />8. Dirt - 9.5/10<br /><br />9. God Smack - 8/10<br /><br />11. Hate To Feel - 10/10<br /><br />12. Angry Chair - 9.5/10<br /><br />13. Would? - 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 95% A<br /><br />Dirt is a strong, powerful, grunge album of the 90s. If you're into Soundgarden or Nirvana you will probably end up liking much of what's on here.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I was SO glad I didn't see this dreadful movie in the cinemas.  I don't understand is why on earth anyone would try to improve on an already masterful adaptation (even with it's flaws) of this beloved novel.  The A & E version is the very best do date. <br /> <br />Keira Knightly was about as believable as I would be in this role. Her acting is stiff and her facial features (what is up with her mouth?) are too distracting. Matthew Macfadyen is so wooden and doesn't betray any feeling towards Knightly.  There isn't any real tension or chemistry between them. <br /> <br />You can skip this movie.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I've been reading about how George Lucas is getting so much money from us. I guess he is and I guess he will make a lot more, I have to say that I will buy this year's version even knowing that next year there might be a new version (may be on HD DVD), it has always been like this and many other films bring out new art, new features, new cuts every single year... is not just George Lucas, we talk about Lucas because we, the people who write here, care about Star Wars.  We asked for this changes so -- the current version is a consecuence and it takes the older version off the market. Besides, this films are not only out there for us, the ones who already own the last year's version... but also for people who has just started his film collection and also for the people who see the original release of Star Wars as an art form and would like to keep it as it was originally achived.  I think this version is a MUST HAVE.
B000GDH9J6|5.0|'Kekelixi' ('Mountain Patrol') is one of those quiet, quasi-documentary films that now and then rises out of nowhere and has such an impact on the viewer that it has the potential for creating some global change action.  Written and directed by Chuan Lu from China and sponsored in part by National Geographic the film was distributed as 'travel/foreign places/environmental issues' product, and while it satisfies those designations, it resonates as a story that is not only based on fact, but one that opens our eyes to another way of life in a very remote area. The effect is stunning.<br /><br />A journalist from Beijing - Ga Yu (Zhang Lei) - travels to Tibet to investigate the poaching of Tibetan antelope and the group of unpaid citizens committed to eradicating the poachers and saving their beloved antelope. The leader of the mountain patrol is Ri Tai (Duobuji) and he has gathered devoted men who spend their lives selflessly searching for the elusive poachers.  Ga Yu goes along for the search, camera in hand, capturing the magnificence of the mountains of Tibet, the men's camaraderie and commitment to their mission, and the fields of antelope carcasses left behind by the poachers whose only concern is to skin the antelope for their pelts of luxurious wool for the world market.  The patrol encounters endless problems with their equipment, food supplies, loss of men to the poachers' guns, and finally capture a group of men (a family) who serve as skinners for the pelts.  Ri Tai attempts to remain fair and non-violent, but his attempts are constantly thwarted. Ga Yu changes from a journalist role to a committed hunter and his relationship with Ri Tai and the other patrolmen is exceedingly touching.  The ending of the film is as quiet as the Tibetan landscape and equally as impactful.<br /><br />The cast is not known to this viewer, but it is difficult to imagine that Duobuji and Zhang Lei are amateur actors, so profoundly moving are their performances.  The haunting music by Lao Zai and the breathtaking cinematography by Yu Cao support Chuan Lu's film.  This art piece is excellent on many levels and is one that deserves a large audience.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, September 06music by Lao Zai and the breathtaking cinematography by Yu Cao support Chuan Lu's film.

B000002KLP|5.0|Prince's 1980 album DIRTY MIND is one of his best albums from his decades long career. The album features a more stripped back production, but the music is still pure soul/funk. There are some really memorable, classic Prince jams here such as \\"When You Were Mine\\", \\"Head\\", \\"Uptown\\" and the title track. It's a brisk album at 8 songs, but all are integral to this album. Prince produced, arranged and composed the whole album. He found success starting with this cd, his third. Deservingly so, this is a classic album that may be his best album.
0807014273|5.0|Frankl, who survived the concentration camps, writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile. Rather, one should be worthy of one's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism, bitterness and despair. He uses poetic, moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth-clenched self-preservation. Though not specifically religious, this masterpiece has a religious purpose--to help us find meaning. This book succeeds immeasurably.<br /><br />*** Why no voting buttons? We do
B000G75AE8|3.0|there was no Christ, no sacrifice? Way to go Slayer. Still pumpin' out records. Your doing a fine job. I chose 666. Tough stuff. If there was not a scrifice then why depict a soldier crucified on a cross wearing a Slayer helmet? I had your poster on my wall when my father said \\"Slayer didn't die on the cross jesus did\\" and right there the truth hit. God is the creator of all evil and the devil is a tool see Isaiah 45:7, Job 2:4. The devil knows the word of God and uses it against God (Matthew 4:6). Why don't you pick it up (the word) and know it your self so you can start making some better sense with your lyrics.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Well drawn characters involved in a continuing storyline plus excellent episodic, stand-alone stories about ghosts and ghouls. This is the best TV series about the occult since X-Files. Some of the stories (\\"Bloody Mary\\" comes to mind) will make you want to sleep with the lights on. Urban legends, monsters, ghosts and ghouls. Great series.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|\\"Brick\\" uses a familiar style to tell a convential story, but it all unfolds in an unconventional way.  It provides an involving story with rich characters, but in a strange way, those aren't the aspects we pay attention to.  Instead, we're focused ont he way it all unfolds. <br /> <br />For those familar with the 1930's crime novels, or even current and well known Films Noir, this style may not be clear right away.  And for those not familiar with either of the previously stated, it will never be clear, but you'll have fun watching it anyway.  \\"Brick\\" tells it's narrative in the Film Noir style and the result is somewhere between 'Memento' and 'L.A Confidential.'   <br /> <br />To provide the details of the plot would be unfair to the audience who has nto yet seen the picture.  But I will say that it involves a loner high school student named Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Emilie' de Ravin).  When she truns up dead in a sewage drain, he takes it upon himself to investigate the murder.  Although a loner, Brendan is on the up and up with each of the high schools' social classes and it quickly becomes clear that his lack of friends is by choice.   <br /> <br />As he questions, figths and sacrifices his way to the truth, he encounters several characters that will either help him or hurt him, sometimes both, and more than once.  But the details of the plto aren't as much fun as the unique dialogue or the film's gritty look.  \\"Brick\\" has been directed by Rian Johnson, a first time director who clearly shows a talent for evoking mood and energy on the screen.  If the plot doesn't totally mesh, it doesn't matter, as often it would with traditional films noir.  This one takes place at a modern urban High School and all the evidence doesn't have to add up; because while they are speaking and acting like they are good at scheming or investigating, they are still students in high school afterall.  There is a scene that demonstrates this perfectly when a character named \\"The Pin\\" has cookies and juice served to him by his mother as he has a meeting with Brendan about 'the brick' of the film's title.   <br /> <br />There are shocking moments in the film that surprised me.  The movie has twists and turns that should be apparent early on, because the film uses the traditional cliches of the crime novel, but I was easily distracted from this by the fact that these are teenagers.  Brendan occupies every moment of screen time and we know just what he knows when he knows it.  We want him to solve the crime and bring justice to those responsible.  Does justice come?  I will not say, but finding out sure is fun.
B00006LLNU|5.0|On my review of Takk, I said that it was probably Sigur Ros's best album. Now that I've listened to ( ) a few more times I'm having second thoughts. <br /> <br />As the title and lack of track titles suggest, most of the music on ( ) is highly minimalistic. The first time I listened to it I thought it was too sparse. But after I listned to it a few more times I picked up on melodies that were so subtle that they were almost implied. <br /> <br />The music here has a strange way of sounding meloncholy and blissful at the same time.  <br /> <br />If you don't have a Sigur Ros album yet, I'd recommend the more accessable Takk first. Come back to this one when you're ready.  <br /> <br />
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|When approaching this Director's Cut of 'Kingdom of Heaven,' it is important to note that is a completely new experience from the theatrical version.  The 144 minute theatrical release was a flawed masterpiece, with large plto holes and a worthy performance by Bloom.  This 194-minute Director's Cut is an epic masterpiece with extraordinary thematic content and a magnificent perfromance by Bloom.   <br /> <br />In the theatrical release, the main plot points were jammed together to provide a forward moving momentum and it seemed as though Balian's motivations and feelings changed on a whim from moment to moment.  But with further development, often slowly paced, and deeper looks into the plot, these motivations and feelings take on a whole new demention.   <br /> <br />The Director's Cut is presented as a 3-act production complete with an orchestral overture, intermission and enteracte.  Some of the deeper plot developments include the fact that the Priest Balian murders at the start of the film is his very own brother.  This adds a new level to their tension and starts off Balian's character in a much more defined way.  Other significant definitions are Balian's reason for not killing Gui and becoming King, and Sybila's son becoming King before discovering that he is also a lepar.   <br /> <br />To give away all the new material in this version would take away fromt he experience of watching it.  It's a shame that studios want such short running times for films of this magnitude.  If this had been the version released in theatres, there is no doubt in my mind that it would have been a front runner for Best Picture at Oscar time.  Scott truly got ripped off by being forced into such dramatic cuts.  But either way you look at it, he knows just what he is doing.   <br /> <br />
0385336691|5.0|If you have never read a Jack Reacher novel, it is time to start!  And once you read one of them, you will have to find all of them.  It isn't often I run into an author that totally holds my interest.  There are never any boring parts and it doesn't take long to read one of Lee Childs books as it is difficult to find a stopping place...My only complaint would be that I find it hard to get anything else done once I start on the next Jack Reacher adventure.
B00005JP0R|4.0|I couldn't help but like The Ant Bully!  The visuals were amazing, a plus if seen in Imax.   <br /> <br />I liked the characters and the people sent to voice them.  The talent they found for this movie is amazing!   <br /> <br />The story isn't bad.  It was a bit disappointing though.  They could have fleshed out their plot a bit more.  88 minutes didn't give enough time to cover any more than the absolute basics. <br /> <br />The message given out was helpful.  Empathy and helping each other.  Use your differences to make your world a better place.  That's something most adults haven't learned to do! <br /> <br />All in all, I liked The Ant Bully.  I'll probably buy it on DVD when it comes out and watch it a few more times!   <br /> <br />Not that it didn't come with a few disappointments.  Still, it's certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen.  Not by far. <br /> <br />I'd recommend that you see it and make up your own mind. <br /> <br />As a side note, I really liked the scores!  I'm a sucker for anything remotely beautiful when it comes to movie scores!

B00020HEG6|4.0|I falled in love with the Children's Choir \\"Double Trouble\\". The first time I heard, I didn't like it but after I heard again and again, I started to like it. The song grews in me and always came in my head. The combinations of the music and song are superb. The rest are also good such as Hagrid the Profesor, A Window to the past,Buckbeak Flight, Aunt Marge's Waltz and Mischief Managed. Like the other 2 of Harry Potter soundtrack which I also owned, this one is another great job from John William that I really impressed and saluted. Now I think I am going to add Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire Soundtrack as another one of my collections.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I was an innocent babe of \\"6\\" when this movie came out and only just discovered it, ironically when I was 30 back in 2000.  Ha!  Asside from the appearence of people(plasti-face surgury done right,) most LESS intelligent people, in particular a real life plasti-face on some Fox show that had so much \\"stuff\\" on her face and body she could barely speak(though had nothing to say) is the reality of it.  You cannot be someone you aren't and if you do you run the risk of being Frankenstien's monster.  She was(in real life).  My brother's college classmate wanted a big chin over his mousey face and so now has a  plastic pile-o-crapola under his neck Ha!  for being so stupid, I say.  this movie is actually a walk in the park compared to what is happening today and shows the \\"future\\" is sooner than one realises.  The nasty nineties(which I adored) became the neat-n-spiffy 21st century.  Sharply ascending zippers and high-strung people who struggle to hide thier uggly character(el demon).  That is New York City(git u rope!)  Of course this movie-show(a coloaklial 70's term) is in a \\"Ultra\\" modern environment(nowadays that is an obsolete term replaced with \\"Post\\" Modern). with a method of escape in the rural countryside of hell.  The domes(remenscent of Dr. Who's Genisis of the Daleks, Kalide Citedel) is a beautifully done symbol of the future that is not the Earth we know today(or America we knew in 1970+)  Typical 60's/70's mentality of actually HAVING a place to escape from the hum-drum pretty boiez school but what evah!  Farienhieght 451 playes out exactly the same. In reality, their will be no escape from a totalitarian scociety, those in charge are too cleaver and the rest of us too stupid.<br /><br />Duh End.
6304936303|4.0|I generally don't like Tony Scott's work, but I did like this film.  Bruce Willis plays another smart a** character here, but Bruce's schtick was still fresh at the time, so it still works.  Damon Wayans is very good as his sidekick.  Aside from a grueling, cringe inducing opening scene (a takeoff on Hank Williams, Jr.'s Monday Night Football song, which is also cringe inducing), the film is filled with very violent action, great one liners, a good sense of humour, a decent story, and a great scene where you see a wide receiver pull a gun (NFL players, don't get any ideas).  The film has no depth or substance, but I have to admit I liked it.  This is the only Tony Scott film I really like.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|What more can I add?<br /><br />Cecilia Bartoli just \\"does it\\" for me almost every time. She is just fantastic in my books. I love her dearly. She can give one an adrenalin rush with her bravura singing and then break one's heart with her pathos.<br /><br />This is a superb collection of Baroque arias from \\"almost\\" operas! ;-))<br />I also liked the cheeky and none-too-subtle references to La Dolce Vita on<br />cover and the images inside the disc. Nice to see an opera singer with a playful sense of humour!<br /><br />I am listening to this disc as I write this review and all I can say is that I love this disc and it is clearly one of the best Signorina Bartoli has released, although I like all of her recordings. Listen to track 12 and you will buy this disc.<br /><br />More, please!<br /><br />PS: How about DECCA getting Cecilia Bartoli and Andreas Scholl together for a musical project? I'd love to see two of my favourite singers together on the one disc.<br />PSPS: If you like Opera Proibita, buy Andreas Scholl's Arcadia and Arias for Senesino, too!

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Sure this film is full of implausibilities and self-conscious stylism, but overall it's quite entertaining without insulting your intelligence.<br /><br />There are some film noir conventions, but also a fair bit of \\"Rushmore\\" type geek-cool stuff, mainly in the form of the central character who is kind of like the unlikely Nerd-Hero of the century, a skinny bespectacled and shabbily dressed guy who somehow possesses the steely nerves, determination, and capacity for punishment of a samurai warrior.  The Count-Dracula resembling dope dealer is hilarious, as is his pumped up bodyguard---\\"camp\\" a la David Lynch's old work, would be a good description of much of this film.  The only quasi-letdown was the ending, in which all the loose ends suddenly get wrapped up neatly in a GREAT EXPLANATION/VINDICATION type of conclusion.<br /><br />I went into it with low expectations and found myself very pleasantly surprised.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I'm not going to compare this to other films. This one like every other movie, stands on its own. I can't stand the need of reviewers to compare films and make each new one an amalgamation of past films. They go on and on about how great they thought those were. I take each movie individually as it comes along. I don't care about who directed it, and what they directed in the past. I believe it does actors and directors an injustice to pull up roles that have nothing to do with the current piece under discussion.  <br /> <br />I am purely and simply looking for entertainment. Take me away from the worries of modern life and show me something else, escapist entertainment. I should think most people are. I want impossible feats of heroism. I don't care if they're believable or not. I want fantastic heroes that can do things that I can never hope to do. The strong men or women that can ride to the rescue and right the wrongs of modern day life, from the bullies on the playground to the corrupt politicians. I want to see people who fly, and fight, and great car chases, wonderful illogical romances, magic and ESP. That's what entertainment is. It's fiction. Every bit of it is made up in the mind of someone, whether it's a book, play, or movie. The interpretation of that idea is what we see as a final product. Good acting is a must. A good script and good direction are also a requirements.  <br /> <br /> <br />This movie succeeds briliantly in that aim. I was drawn into the story , it took my breath, and my attention until the end credits rolled. V is the mysterious vengeful antihero. I call him that because he's definitely not too sweet. I thought the girl's name Eve, to be telling. The acting was good without being over dramatic. The people that played the roles seemed to fit the roles well. No, I am not going to spoil the movie with a blow by blow account. I believe it's important to view a movie without any prior seeds planted by someone else who liked it or dislikedit.  <br /> <br />If entertainment is your aim then this is a great film. I was absolutely amazed. This was great after all the other garbage that Hollywood has produced, tried to dress up as entertainment, and shove down our throats in the last five years or so. They keep slinging it out despite the steadily declining theater audiences. <br /> <br /> <br />The plot is not too twisted to grasp easily, even though there are some surprises. There is plenty of action for the action buffs. There is a moral message for the conscientous. There is a very scary political message not even thinly disguised. \\"The people should not be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of the people.\\" There isn't any sex, this movie doesn't need it. There are however a lot of emotions.  <br /> <br /> <br />I cannot for the life of me get over all these arm chair critics. Even though for the most part they've been positive. I don't care what they have to say. I want to see it for myself. That is always my advice. Rent it. Watch it. Like it. Buy it. Don't take my word for it, or that of anyone else. Don't let someone's idea of what a great movie, of what great entertainment should be, make you miss something you might enjoy, or influence you to buy something you will hate. I learned that a long time ago, it remains my practice today. I've never regretted it. I have loved movies that others wouldn't give one star. I have hated with a passion movies that others gave five stars. So rent it and make up your own mind. I've bought my copy of \\",V for Vendetta,\\" and I've watched it several times already. I don't own any DVD's that I don't watch again and again.
B00005JP4U|5.0|This production documents the scientific evidence that clearly indicates indicates and tracks the highly significant correlation between the increased levels of greenhouse gases (particularly CO2) and an extremely abnormal warming trend globally.  While correlationships do not necessarily imply causation, in the case of the increasing levels of CO2 and global warming data correlates imply clear and significant inter-relationships than any other normal or abnormal factors.  This means that their \\"inter-twinedness\\" is almost certainly causative on the part of CO2. <br /> <br />The presenter, Al Gore is highly informative and balanced in his reporting of the data.   This man clearly knows of what he is talking.   This documentary is a MUST-SEE.
B00007E8O5|5.0|At first I thought this album were bonus tracks. Only after reading the liner notes did I realize this is the album Jerry intended to put out. What a great album. It goes to show you Layne and Cantrell were equal song writing partners in Alice In Chains.
B00005R62N|5.0|I got the vinyl album when I was 16. I ve now this REMASTERED CD. It s better than the original, for sure. I cannot believe Rob did an amazing performance like this! This is a Classic. If you don t like this album, I m not sure you really like Metal. My Playlist includes bands like Vile, Mayhem, Iron Maiden, Helloween, Old Sepultura s*it, Napalm Death, etc But THIS album is necessary, is an essential. The first Heavy Metal Live album. It s in the same (and above)level of Rust in Peace (Megadeth), And Justice for All (Metallica), Reign in Blood (Slayer), The Number of the Beast (Maiden). You cannot be a Metalhead withou this one. You don t have it? What s going on with You?? Get it!! Now!!!!! ;)

Every track on the C.D has it's own unique quality.    I certainly don't understand how someone could be disappointed with this album.     All I can say is find out for yourself. You won't regret it .It's a gr8 album. Any doubts? Give it time to grow on you.     It \\"won't  let you down, No It won't leave you falling\\".
B00005JKL8|5.0|Behind Enemy's Line is one of the greatest patriotic movies. It's about a disillusioned Navy fighter pilot who got more than he bargained for after getting shot down. Unlike many other war movies which has a lot of shooting, and not much else, this one has great character development, awesome scenes, and a hilarious stunt the aircraft crew pulled off using a football. The super-slow motion shots are simply incredible, and the pictures are rich with numerous imageries, some containing messages for the audience, others complimenting the plot. You can watch this over and over again.
B0000042MY|4.0|Jerry McCulley's Amazon.com review is surely a joke. This movie and this soundtrack are the most stirring to come down the pike in a very long time. \\"Promentory\\" is, to me, the most moving of all the tracks--dark, poignant, and uplifting all at the same time--and can stand on its own as a magnificent work. But, of course, the whole CD is well worth having. Several years after its release I'm still enjoying the grandeur of it all.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can watch this film again and again.  The casting is superb (except Fanny, the leading man's sister).  The beginning is a little slow going, but the characters are so fully developed and their relationships are sparkling.  The ending is well worth waiting for!

0380807343|5.0|Coraline is bored in her new apartment. But one day,she notices a strange door in her new home. Her mother tells her it's where they boarded up the end of the flat,although Coraline is not so sure. She opens it to find a surreal parallel world created by her ''other parents''.The world is also inhabitad by singing rats, soulless children,and a mysterious black cat. Coraline can stay on one condition,her new ''parents'' can sew black buttons on her face and steal her soul. Dave Mckean's black and white illustrations add a creepy touch to the story (I found the one on page 68 the spookiest). When Coraline questions the Other Mother's power, her world flattens and resembles a bad drawing. It seems to me that the Other Mother is another aspect of Coaraline, who she has to overcome.      Gaiman's imagery is cleverly concieved, with phrases such as ''in tones as smooth as oiled silk'' or ''her hand jumped off Coraline's shoulder like a frightended spider''.     CORALINE is an imaginative, highly entertaining read that will delight children from eight to eighty. Highly recommended.
0553573403|5.0|It is difficult to offer this book praise that hasn't already been offered, but I would feel remiss not to chime in as this is without question one book among the best I've ever read.  The book is structured so that within the main story, there are a large number of other stories, each reliant upon a specific character.  What the book amounts to is a collection of stories about a large cast of specific and very deeply developed characters that, when taken as a whole, begin to paint a picture of the larger \\"story-behind-the-story.\\"  Each individual chapter of the book rises into climax and resolution, giving it the feel of constant action and tension, while continuously setting up future conflicts.  The main story doesn't resolve, and in fact deepens just as the book concludes, paving the way for what promises to be an explosive second volume.  I'll wrap up with a few comments to respond to some of the reviews I read before starting this book:<br /><br />1. There is a good bit of sex, and some profanity, but only as seems necessary to establish traits and personalities of the main characters.  Although at times graphic, these parts are not drawn out or dwelt upon and are not typically made to be focal points of the story.  They are accessories for the sake of characterization, doing their job well, driving the reader to deeper love/hate of the character involved.<br /><br />2.  Anyone who says that the plots don't resolve doesn't understand the structure of the book.  This isn't one story.  It is many that are interwoven.<br /><br />3. There are indeed ALOT of major characters, and at first it seems daunting to try to get to know them all and keep track of who is doing what.  Trust me when I say this resolves very quickly as you get to know the characters and their houses and involve yourself with their lives.  This is what makes this book rich.  It is a depth I've not seen in any other novel I've read.<br /><br />4. The book leaves much to interpretation.  Being character driven, you will love some characters, and you will hate some.  The beauty is that, much as in real life, the choices are left up to you.  There is no real \\"good guy/bad guy\\" here.  I find that within the same houses there are family members that I truly love, and those that so anger me I can almost experience them tangibly.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this book.  It is the most deeply developed, emotionally moving, heart stirring, adrenalin pumping, vastly entertaining, beautifully and classicly written piece of modern literate art I have read in a very, very long time.  Just wow.eing character driven, you will love some characters, and you will hate some.  The beauty is that, much as in real life, the choices are left up to you.

B00005JP0A|5.0|Whoever's idea to buy the rights to Lauren Weisberger's novel is a genius. Despite a rather abysmal novel, The Devil Wears Prada shines on screen. Indeed, The Devil Wears Prada is an example of how some storylines work much better on the big screen than in print.<br /><br />The film's stylish success is due largely to the over-the-top character Miranda Priestly played by Meryl Streep, the incredible  actress who has wowed us with many impeccable performances. Streep revealed a well-kept secret - her gene for comedy which has so far been demonstrated only in Death Becomes Her (1992) and  to some degrees in last year's Prime. Anyone else might have turned Miranda into a noisy empty vessel but Streep gives Miranda life and great stature.<br /><br />Miranda is the go-getting and ridiculously demanding-cum-bitchy editor-in-chief of Runway magazine. And incidentally, the matron of this acclaimed magazine house is the head of many like-minded employees including an overzealous first assistant (Emily Hunt) and second-in-command (Stancy Tucci). So when the just graduated wide-eyed Andy Sachs played by Anne Hathaway assumes her position as the second assistant to Miranda, Streep's deadpan no-nonsense stance combined with her ultra-acerbic tongue make Sachs life indeterminately difficult. Not willing to give up, the young lass transforms herself from a dowdy girl to a glamorpuss who satisfies every of Miranda's whim and fancies. Intertwined with this are also a love story and another of finding who you really are and want to be.<br /><br />Streep's comic brilliance makes the character of Miranda Priestly so illuminating and unpologetic while complementing the innoncence of Hathaway's Andy Sachs whose only aspiration is to be a proper journalist rather than a fashion junkie. Stanley Tucci's performance also adds more zest to the film. Last of all, the dazzling couture pieces that appear so frequently is bound to make Devil an ultimate fashion feast.<br /><br />In the end, The Devil Wears Prada is highly entertaining with an Oscar-worthy performance from Streep whose artistry is undeniably and undisputedly ace.

B000001E3L|2.0|I like this version of Tupelo Honey but other than that, it sounds like Van's is trying to reinvent himself as a lounge singer. Don't get me wrong, he truly deserves to be called \\"The Man\\", but this is the soft-rock crap that most of his detractors despise. Elsewhere he makes good songs, both his own (Moondance, Gloria) and others (T-Bone Walker's Stormy Monday, Freddie King's Have You Ever Loved a Woman?, Sly Stone's Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), James Brown's It's a Man's Man's Man's World) bad. I hate it when people do that. Loyal sidekick Georgie Fame is about as good as his name suggests (in other words, not at all), and it lacks the haunting mystique of Astral Weeks or the joy of Moondance. I listened to it once, and never played anything but Tupelo Honey again.
B000E6UWE4|4.0|I find myself wondering what's got me so much into this story.  I like George R R Martin...fantasy very much grounded on Earth.  I like Ricardo Pinto...very original fantasy but still much rooted on Earth and with no \\"fantasy-like\\" magic to speak of.  <br />As Fantasy goes, my tastes are not Tolkieniske.  I'm not into moving, talking trees or elves and dwarves and talking animals. <br /> <br />It took me a long while to start reading Erikon's series.  I passed by it many times, mainly because certain reviews compared the work to Tolkien like universe.  Paradoxically, it was the negative reviews that got me seriously wondering.  Because... even the negative reviews talked about how gifted the writing was.  Well, considering the number of all published copies in the Chapters local store, I figured it was worth the $10.99 (cad). <br /> <br />I read Gardens of the Moon and immediately I went out and got all available sequels.  I'm about to embark on Deadhouse Gates. <br />Yet, I'm still not sure how to review Gardens.  All I can say is (and believe me, for ME this is big), I never even felt the compulsion to skip even a single word, sentence, chapter or page to get to the good parts. <br /> <br />There is the kind of magic I like, subtle and powerful.  There are talking birds with a sense of humour (Crone), a great Hound (Gear) that momentarily you want to adopt and a being/god that is tall, dark and handsome...and DARK (Anomander Rake).  In the midst of chaos, I can't help but follow the story and wonder/live with amazing charecters like Tattersail, Paran, Whiskeyjack and Sorry...even Hairlock. <br /> <br />It's dark, it's bloody, it's at times confusing,  but you can't help wondering where it's taking you.  Pretty amazing... <br />

The journey from Gotham to Metropolis is exciting and seeing the battle between Batman and Superman may be a sign of things to come.

B00005JPBP|5.0|This film will blow you away. Why ? <br />Well, just look at the cast. Then think about the director. You've seen these fine actors in great films before. You've probably seen Nolan's 'Momento' and 'Batman Begins'. <br />If you were intrigued by the tricks of plot and perception in 'Momento' and the adventure and dark excitement of 'Batman Begins', you'll find that both are combined in 'The Prestige', as it is based on the World Fantasy Award Winning novel (the books 'Perfume' and 'Replay'-the source of the basic idea behind 'Groundhog Day' - won this award also) by Christopher Priest, one of the finest authors in the world today, whose books defy categorisation. <br />I suggest you read his works now, or as Neil Gaiman says 'all the cool people will laugh at you,'.
B00000ILDE|4.0|Aliens *is* one of the better sequel efforts, since we all know most sequels (with the notable exception of The Godfather Part II) are just awful, cynical dreck. But the Amazon review by Marshall Fine says it's better than the original, Alien, and I'm not sure even James Cameron, megalomaniacal director that he is, would dis Ridley Scott like that. Note that Ridley made another of the 10 or 15 best sci-fi movies ever made, Blade Runner. Cameron did made the first two Terminator movies, but just try and tell me the second one was better than the first. I dare you.
0784011176|3.0|The star of this film is a grand piano which Ada brought from Scotland to New Zealand, along with her young daughter, Flora, as she arrives for an arranged marriage.  Ada is mute, having stopped speaking aloud at the age of six, but she could talk clearly in her mind.  She speaks through her musical talent as she makes that piano speak as no classical pianist could do any better.  When Stewart and his entourage arrived on the seaside to carry them back to the village out in the forest, the piano is left behind because it is too heavy.  We bought an old \\"Baldwin\\" piano upright for my sons to learn to play; got gypped at the second hand shop as the \\"Baldwin\\" sing was glued on it and in parenthesis on the receipt.  We paid much too much for something which took six men to move. <br /> <br />Ada and Flora would walk to the seashore where they made beautiful music, the mother on the piano and Flora dancing around like a fairy.  It could have been Yanni there playing by the sea, it was so beautiful.  Little Flora loved to make up stories about her absent father, that he had been a great German composer and died after being struck by lightning.  Children have vivid imaginations, but a basic sense of propriety.  Getting the piano moved to the home of George Baines, who was illiterate but bought the piano at a price which changed all of their lives.  Stewart had told Ada, \\"You will teach him.\\"  Instead, George taught Ada what it felt like to be loved by a real man.  It proved to be quite a challenge to get that piano over the hills to the settlement.  It arrived slightly out of tune, but not injured.  George made a deal with Ada about how she could get it back, one visit for every black key.   <br /> <br />Stewart is a frustrated husband who spends his time bartering with the Indians and had no idea of what was happening, though Flora had seen it firsthand.  Ada was torn between two lovers and thoroughly miserable.  Was it worth the price?  I'm unhappy; I can think of nothing else -- don't sleep, can't eat; she went to him voluntarily.  Stewart was told by Flora what was happening and he looked in at their indiscretion.  When she heard that George was leaving the island, she send her \\"thank you\\" for the piano, the \\"C\\" note out of the piano.  Flora, silly girl, caused her mother to suffer another trauma worse than her lack of speech.  She expressed her hurts, needs, desires through music, but now she had lost her music, her reason to live. <br /> <br />Silence is golden sometimes, as she heard a weird lullaby in her disturbed mind.  Stewart sets her free because he loved her.  She became demented without the man she loved after Stewart had taken an ignorant man's revenge.  It ended like the 'Scarlet Letter' had Poe penned it with shades of \\"Barbara Allen\\" mixed in with \\"The Long Black Veil\\" as she walks these hills.  She admitted that \\"it was my fault.\\"  He felt like it had been one bad dream.  She was one hard-headed determined woman who lost her reason to live, let the past go and reconfigured her future with the man she loved.  This movie won an Academy Award.  Holly Hunter did a fantastic acting job, though I could have done without the nude scenes.
B000F4MLZ8|2.0|Joshua Radin's We Were Here is a pleasant but not flawless major label debut. The album gained a large following as an iTunes exclusive quickly becoming the number one selling folk album on the download service, last month it was released to stores by Columbia Records and its popularity continues to grow.<br /><br />Radin makes predominately acoustic music that houses a wide array of influences. The album opens with the track Sundrenched World that has Radin whispering his lovelorn poetry on top of a lovely cello arrangement. The track is well done musically however the lovelorn poetry I mentioned isn't something you haven't heard countless times before. The cellos come back in to play on and off throughout the album but not nearly enough to my liking.Star Mile, the following track, is one of my favorites on the album. It hearkens back to the days of Simon And Garfunkel or Crosby, Stills and Nash with great harmonies and fret work. The harmonies between Radin and Priscilla Hartranft are one of the brightest points of the release. However, multi-tracked recordings of his own vocals are used in place of Hartranft many times that would have been more effective with another human voice singing.<br /><br />Radin would benefit from taking more chances with his work. Trying something different lyrically and changing his vocal tone occasionally would have helped this album a great deal. The vocals become a bit monotonous by albums end. In spite of all the negative points I have illustrated this album will appeal to some. If you are a fan of Elliot Smith, Duncan Shiek or older folk-rock acts such as the aforementioned Crosby, Stills and Nash odds are you'll find something to like here.<br /><br />BUZZGRINDER.COM

Lauren Childs does a wonderful job as usual.

B0008KLVG4|4.0|'Jaws', directed by Steven Spielberg was released in '75 and still stands as one of the biggest box office money makers of all-time. Now, some thirty-one years later it probably looks a little hokey compared to modern high action state-of-the-art special effects. Fortunately this film has much more to offer than sweaty palms or an occassional gasp and scream. The real strength of this film lies in the teaming together Richard Dryfuss, Roy Scheider and the ever elusive Rober Shaw as the three valiant souls willing to way anchor and search for the great white killer shark terrorizing the little seaside resort community of Amity. Watching their transformation from initial hostilities slowly evole into deep mutual respect is the best part of the film. Their constant banter is hilarious, insightful and packed with great quotable dialogue.<br /><br />If you don't like scary films just pretend the shark isn't there and watch for the great acting!<br /><br />Also a wonderful performance by Murray Hamiliton as Amity's Mayor.

B00006CXXU|5.0|In celebration of Christina Aguilera's latest #1 album, \\"Back To Basics\\", I decided to take a look at \\"Stripped\\", her multi-platinum 2002 sophomore effort that I never thought I'd ever consider listening to. Thankfully, there's more to this album than the madly infectious rebelliousness of lyrically empty Rock'n'Roll sleaze-fest/lead hit single \\"Dirrty\\" (featuring rapper Redman). Her naked album cover art is like that of most others...a bold, sexually appealing way of making an artistic statement. And indeed, Christina Aguilera has grown a lot more as an artist.    For example, she's a powerhouse vocalist with pipes that any sane female pop singer would envy. She was already a strong singer in the first place, but it's nice to remind listeners that her vocals are still running strong. What surprises me more than her vocal pipes, however, is her helping hand in most of the album's 20 tracks (including interludes) AND her genre-hopping abilities. Ok, so she's nothing like Nelly Furtado (and there's little chance that she ever will be), nor does she take as many risks as Pink or Shakira, but it's still nice to know that she's willing to step out of her comfort zone and take risks.    Whether she's inhabiting the role of rebellious Rock'n'Roll party girl  (\\"Dirrty\\"), the wailing Gospel-Soul woman (the inspirational \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\"), the helpless lover (the smooth, seductive Latin groove \\"Infatuation\\"), the female-empowering feminist (the powerful guitar-driven \\"Fighter\\" & the Lil' Kim-assisted ladies anthem \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\"), the troubled soul sista (the soulful, emotional ballad \\"Impossible\\", featuring the one-and-only prodigious Alicia Keys on piano) or the broken-hearted daughter of an abusive father (\\"I'm OK\\"), Christina Aguilera pulls off every role with breathtaking results that startlingly differentiate from one another. \\"Soar\\", \\"The Voice Within\\" & the subtle \\"Beautiful\\" also serves their purpose as inspirational, uplifting ballads designed to motivate listeners to save themselves from the troubles around them. The latter one is especially refreshing because it gives listeners (and Christina herself) a break from her occasional over-singing.    Then again, can you really hold that against her? With so many individuals relying on filters, synthesizers, vocoders & studios to perfect their thin, wispy vocals (Paris Hilton, Hilary Duff, etc.), you people should be thankful that artists like Christina Aguilera know how to captivatingly sing from the soul. Another album that most haters seem to have unjustly rejected...5 STARS!    5 Best Tracks:  \\"Beautiful\\"  \\"Can't Hold Us Down (feat. Lil' Kim)\\"  \\"Impossible (feat. Alicia Keys\\"  \\"Dirrty (feat. Redman)\\"  \\"Fighter\\"
0446310786|5.0|Just reread this book for the umpteenth time and love it all over again.  I first read it as a young teenager and knew even then that it was an important, near-perfect book.  I understand that we all have different tastes, but I'm amazed that some few reviewers actually found the book boring.  I can't help but doubt that it was really read and digested by them.  If you haven't read it, do so.  It's an absolutely wonderful book--a classic to be treasured.  Thank heaven Harper Lee wrote it!
B000FGGE68|2.0|Milla Jovovich appeared in one of my all-time favorite sci-fi action comedies (The Fifth Element), but she also holds the title of \\"Most Overused Female Actress\\" in some really shoddy flicks (Resident Evil, Dummy, and Return to the Blue Lagoon just to touch on a few). So I hesitate whenever I see her name attached to a title. Perhaps her agent needs to be a bit more selective when handing her manuscripts.<br /><br />So it is with a heavy heart that I have to say her unfortunate role selections seem to have no end in sight with the addition of ULTRAVIOLET to her sagging film repertoire.<br /><br />Vampires (aka Hemophages) have been done to death, but I don't mind that. If a story is interesting and contains vampires, hey, that's fine by me. But shoving Milla into a body-fitting, white leather outfit and having her kick [...] in almost every scene makes me think that much more could've been made out of this film rather than just a vampiric female ruffian who's deadly with a blade. Swinging swords and Matrix-like action sequences were all one gets to see here ...that and some really bad CGI (harkening back to the days of TRON).<br /><br />The story of vampires and humans battling for supremacy is nothing new to film, too, and it would've been nice to see more character development surrounding Milla's Violet character and that of the main antagonist, Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus played by Nick Chinlund. But we just are led to believe that the two hate each other because they're on opposite sides of the human/vampire equation. Or are they? It seems the scriptwriters/filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about that either. What a mess.<br /><br />The story tries to pull a sympathetic chord with the audience by explaining that Violet lost a child in-utero, so when she starts feeling empathy for Six (Cameron Blight), a young boy who carries a virus that can wipe out all vampires (or can he?), we (the audience) are supposed to support her decision not to kill the very child who could kill her. But the emotional impact is nil, again, since almost all of the film time is dedicated to swordplay, killing, and showing us how nice Milla looks in her leathers while decapitating a few hundred bad guys at a time.<br /><br />There have been comparisons made between Ultraviolet and AEON FLUX. I've seen and rated both of these films and found the latter much more entertaining than the former. Although both films had deadly women as their prime protagonists, Aeon Flux actually had a story behind it with some intriguing concepts, while Ultraviolet simply put a futuristic bent on a worn-out theme.he emotional impact is nil, again, since almost all of the film time is dedicated to swordplay, killing, and showing us how nice Milla looks in her leathers while decapitating a few hundred bad guys at a time.

B000A3VTT8|5.0|I finally received my long-awaited copy of the Ponelle/Abbado/von Stade DVD  <br />and I can tell you the thing is pure wow!  I truly believe this effort is  <br />one of the most perfect attempts at committing opera to film, drawing as  <br />close a relationship as possible between actual opera house performance and  <br />studio film. The balance is nothing less than remarkable resulting in a  <br />very special work all on its own.  <br /> <br />Ponnelle gets his wonderful cast to truly work as a team and the result is  <br />never less than magical. von Stade, for me, is the most radiant Cenerentola  <br />of all time and I have to wonder; has there ever been a more willowy,  <br />beautiful heroine? Her subtle facial expressions are more numerous than  <br />many other mezzos in this role yet she never once comes close to becoming  <br />cloying or hammy - each is just right and feels perfectly natural. Her  <br />singing throughout is exciting.  <br /> <br />Abbado sometimes (in my opinion) pushes things along at breakneck pace, but  <br />this still feels Rossinian in spirit and makes the thing crackle with a  <br />vivaciousness that is not impossible to get caught up in, ever bubbly and  <br />buoyant. The La Scala forces all seem caught up in it as well and it makes  <br />for a very special presentation of a very special work.  <br /> <br />From \\"Una volta c'era un re\\" the entire role is stamped with that  <br />unmistakable von Stade magic. I don't know of a singer who has a  <br />better \\"melancholy\\" quality built right into her instrument and in this  <br />role it works like magic. This quality makes the contrasts stand out more  <br />than usual and are so effective, noticeably in the first great ensemble,  <br />the Act I quintet, where her melancholia transforms into a sparkling, put- <br />upon quality.  Here, Rossini shows his hand as one of the greatest, most  <br />inspired \\"technicians\\" ever to put pen a score. This ensemble (one of my  <br />favorites in all of opera) also includes one of my favorite musical  <br />moments; during Cenerentola's patter-commentary (spat out with amazing  <br />clarity) - \\"Cenerentola vien qua, Cenerentola va la, Cenerentola va' su,  <br />Cenerentola vien giu\\" then the amazing little four note scale repeated over  <br />and over \\"Questo e proprio uno strapazzo! Mi volete far crepar\\" is mind  <br />boggling in its simplicity and effectiveness at portraying the moment. (Can  <br />you tell yet this is one of my very favorite operas, too?)   In the  <br />first \\"go\\" at the \\"Questo...\\" von Stade (with her back to the camera) throws  <br />herself like a rag doll being pulled in separate directions - and it is a  <br />wonderful effect that is the perfect visualization of Rossini's breathless  <br />music.   <br /> <br />Francisco Araiza is a thoroughly charming prince, although his aspirate- <br />tackling of the coloratura work is sometimes a bit too much (for my own  <br />taste) which is odd, as when in duetto with von Stade he seems able to  <br />smooth out the passage work. But these two make as handsome a couple as  <br />ever seen in opera and their first sighting of each other and their ensuing  <br />duet is charm personified.  <br /> <br />The rest of the cast includes Paolo Montarsolo as an over-the top Don  <br />Magnifico who really seems intent on burning his bridges in his treatment  <br />of his stepdaughter; the comic book sisters of Clorinda and Tisbe of  <br />Margherita Guglilmi and Laura Zannini - who manage to make the girls into a  <br />hilarious Lucy and Ethel act.  <br /> <br />Forgive me if I'd forgotten just how amazing a singer was Paul Plishka. The  <br />voice is huge, robust, commanding and warm. His Alidoro - Rossini coming to  <br />life, made my heart just swell to almost bursting. There is a spiritual  <br />quality here that looks forward to Parsifal (another of my favorites). The  <br />sense of wide-eyed wonderment von Stade's heroinewears has an honesty that  <br />is hypnotic. She, like Parsifal, at the end of the first Grail scene, is  <br />rendered speechless. Here, Rossini raises his heroine, changing the  <br />simplicity of a fairy tale into a miracle, a lesson about the power of  <br />faith and goodness. It's impossible not love her. Plishka's performance is  <br />complete in every way.  <br /> <br />Claudio Desderi is hilarious - strongly recalling Dom Delouise (which I'm  <br />guessing was not intentional on his part) and, like everyone else, having  <br />the time of his life here.  Like Araiza, Desderi ascribes to the aspirate- <br />ridden method of coloratura, but in this comical role it works to his  <br />advantage. <br /> <br />Ponnelle's staging of the Act II Sextet is perhaps my very favorite staging  <br />of any operatic ensemble on video. Back lighting throws the entire scene  <br />into silhouette with the singer's robotic movements resembling the  <br />intricate motions of a great Bavarian Cuckoo Clock. Remarkably, each singer  <br />retains their individuality by becoming part of something larger. Musically  <br />and cinematically it's amazing, and at it's conclusion, with all of the  <br />intricate movements, Ponelle somehow - as by magic - has each character  <br />returned to their starting positions. Awesome.  <br /> <br />Flicka gets to shine like a genuine diamond in the final scene, once again  <br />imbuing that heartfelt melancholia into \\"Nacqui all' affanno...\\" and then  <br />blazing triumphantly through \\"Non piu mesta.\\"  <br /> <br />Ponnelle's control of everything (including costumes), attention to the  <br />smallest of details, shows just how much he loved this work and we are  <br />indebted to him for bringing this gem to a different level.  <br /> <br />One midnight five years ago, I got out of bed after tossing and turning for  <br />hours, and put on the VHS copy of this. I watched the entire thing and all  <br />my worries seemed to disappear. Later that day I found out it was the  <br />anniversary of the first performance of La Cenerentola. I'm still convinced  <br />Angelina woke me up on purpose!  <br /> <br />I really do believe Rossini's girl is one of the most perfect creations in  <br />all of opera and Ponnelle's film version is a vision and just about one of  <br />the most perfect ways to spend a couple of joyous hours.  <br /> <br />p. <br /> <br />
B000000H66|3.0|The 1st Album was Scream ,the 2ed Leprocy, 3ed Spiritual, 4th Human ,5th Individual ,6th Symbolic , 7th Sound of ,then 8 Live.<br /><br />1 through 3 are the rawer Brutal stuff the Fate  compilation was taken from. After this Human was made and the band started it's new era where Chucks voice is different a little more screaming gutteral and less low gutteral .<br /><br />  Old Death is great to me because the riffs show up in other bands songs every now and then .They wrote the book
B000AYQLX6|5.0|Jerry McCulley has not listened to this album well... first of all.. this an extremely polished album... this album was not a lull in Lennon's musical career.. it is an exceptional album.. what a terrible misrepresentation of a Lennon masterpiece.. Jerry McCulley ought to be ashamed of himself.
068484267X|5.0|McCourt opens a world of poverty and neglect with the hindsight of many years and the perspective of the young boy he was.   <br />Although, in some respects, he was a failure through many of his teaching years, and a lousy husband--his third book, Teacher Man--the plan he executed to get to America from the time he was 16 was awesome and awe inspiring.  It was put perfectly when he described the second bank account (a secret account) he had with money that wasn't for supporting his mother and brothers; \\"...even if we were all going to starve to death I'd never touch a penny of it.\\"
B00005JL0I|3.0|the movie starts off well with it's humor, but you eventually find yourself lost as the plot branches out. there were plenty of scenes that really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. what i really got out of the film was that peter sellers was the only one keep ing the movie together. there's too much humor that is just dated now. atleast rent to see peter sellers.
B00097A5I6|5.0|This is the first Oasis since (What's the Story) Morning Glory? that I can call brilliant with confidence.  Be Here Now has filler problems, SOTSOG lacks accessibility, and Heathen Chemistry is just unoriginal, but 05's dark horse Don't Believe The Truth combines the best elements of all three albums:  Both DBTT and Be Here Now are known for their anthems (`D'You Know What I Mean?,' `Stand By Me,' `All Around the World' matched by `Turn Up the Sun,' `Lyla,' `The Importance of Being Idle'), both DBTT and SOTSOG flow elegantly like easy listening albums are meant to, yet DBTT still rocks away when it needs to like H. Chemistry does during its brightest points.  So what's this mean?  Is this a return to the old days? To Morning Glory? To Definitely Maybe when the band could do no wrong even with on their B-Sides?  Or does it mean that the band is simply lucky enough to find the right combination of songs, something they've tried since 1995?  It depends on your attitude, and the attitude of this fan remains positive; although not quite Morning Glory?, DBTT may be a sign that Oasis is returning to their old ways in a new style. Noel Gallagher has loosened his stranglehold on the band to the point where he doesn't even write the majority of the material.  A good move because all of Liam tracks ring with quality (especially the 1:44 `Meaning of Soul') and Andy Bell's `Turn Up the Sun' competes for the best Oasis track in almost ten years.  It's hard to say if he band will make a complete 180 and become what they once were, but if a follow up matches DBTT's quality, then look out.  Coldplay, Radiohead, Strokes, White Stripes, heads up because the boys are back in town and they've got a lot to prove.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|\\"This Darkened Heart\\" used to be my favorite metal album. Somehow ATR haave outdone themselves on \\"The fall of Ideals\\". This album is simply incredible with no \\"skip through\\" tracks at all. There are much more clean vocals in this album but they do not detract from the devastating heaviness at all. If you are a metalcore fan at all u will love this album.
B000059Z8J|5.0|After taking my 15 year old son to see the new Superman Returns movie, I decided to purchase this one and Superman II to show him.  He really enjoyed both.  Christopher Reeve is my second favorite Superman because no one can beat George Reeves in the original Superman TV Show (which my son also loves to watch)but both of these movies are worth watching.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|Beauty is born! Listen to this cool, refreshing album on any day or night. From the very first song (Like a Star) Corinne makes it clear what she's all about. She doesn't waste time on fussy intros but immediatedly graces us with her easy, honest voice. I still haven't decided what my fave song is; they each carry loveable material within. While I do listen to this album without skipping a beat, I must say that Choux Pastry Heart is my least fave song. I'm not fond of the chorus but verses save it. All in all, an amazing debut. Authentic enough for true music lovers and approachable enough for casual listeners. Corinne is for everyone on any day, at any time.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I found this to be an outstanding miniseries and it's a shame that westerns like this are few and far between... Westerns are such a great format for showing our country and its heritage. Frankly, Lonesome Dove it is Americana.<br /><br />The character interaction between Duvall and Jones makes this film the masterpiece that it is. As viewers, we are drawn into the lives of two lifelong fiends that are entering the twilight years of their lives. Former Rangers, they tamed the SW Border Territory together. Then disillusioned, spent their best years in the personal purgatory of Lonesome Dove...where their only source of amusement is getting drunk, getting laid by the town's only prostitute or stealing horses from across the border. Feats of valor forgotten, their self-respect diminished, they realize that life and opportunity have passed them bye. Both become determined to confront death one last time.<br /><br />What occurs in this film is a keen examination of the love between two aging men, both agreeing to make a cattle drive to Montana and setup a ranch.....a perilous feat worth of recapturing their youth and self respect....but in reality, a journey from which they both hope not to return.<br /><br />Many of us follow the same path, with friendships so old and close that one cannot easily discards one's obligation to the other. This is the common thread that rivets us to the screen .We are brought into the relationship of Call and McCrea to garner what the meaning of friendship is between two men who have known each other for so long. I cannot think of any film that has adequately exposed this quality among men so well except for Lonesome Dove
B000G8NXZK|3.0|Well it seems for the past two years Criterion Collection has been rummaging through their early spine releases and presenting them with new anormorphic transfers, improved sound, and worthy abundant supplements some of these include re-releases such as Fritz Lang \\"M\\", \\"Amarcord\\", \\"playtime\\", \\"Seven Samurai\\". These re-issues are deff. worth putting out again because there totally superior in every aspect to their previous release or the re-issues simply force various Criterion titles to be put back in print such as \\"playtime\\" or \\"wages of fear\\" . Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\" although an excellent film was released in an elaborate three disc box set in 1999 and at what a price but nonetheless it was worth every penny because thats what Criterion specializes in, but to my dismay there re-releasing this massive box set in a new transfer with upgraded sound. At one point I would like to say that The Criterion Collection totally seperated itself from money hungry mainstream studios condemning ubiquitous re issues with an extra \\"deleted scene\\" or 2 minutes of extra footage. Now   I'm having seconds thoughts... It seems The Criterion Collection is jumpig on the band wagon with everyone else and double dipping to milk Criterion afficianado's like myself and you know what they did a good job too because to my unforunate chagrin I have already ordered this new re-release and dropped 50 dollars again why? simply because I cherish my Criterion Collection and I am all about quality when it comes to presentation. But this re-release is not at all necessary infact   I would much rather prefer the Criterion Collection to touch this three disc box set at all it doesn't need a new release. They should try focusin on obtaining rights to movies like \\"Salo\\" or \\"spinal Tap\\" and re-releaseing those instead. I am not totally against double dips as I stated the earlier superior Criterion titles before but the truth of the matter is that we Criterion fans pay top dollar for our dvds and we don'tmind either because we know exactly what we are getting, at 40 bucks a title exceeding any other mainstream studio retail price we are adding a piece of artwork to our collection with superior picture and sound with exclusive and over the top bonus material and not too mention innovative and elegant artwork. I just hope Criterion Doesn't start digging into more spine #'s that have substantial bonus material and adding a new transfer or a new 5.1 dolby sound    its tedious and redundant and Criterion is far more superior in delivering superb titles and differentiating themselves from mainstream studios.
B000AARKOO|3.0|I am a student of history and have read extensively in this period so I was looking forward to this film.  Unfortunately this is a terribly flawed film and this begins with Orlando Bloom who is terribly miscast. Dirt and grit does not make you either masculine or heroic.  Bloom is alleged to be a \\"blacksmith\\" but he is probably about 50 pounds too light to be convincing in that role.  We are expected to believe that in a matter of hours / days he becomes a skilled warrior capable of ending off some well armed and mounted men-at-arms.  Mastering the broadsword requires a great deal more practice.<br /><br />The villains in the film are based on actual characters and come across pretty much like I think they were.  The Muslims are portrayed in a rather sympathetic light which isn't too far from the historical record.  I thought the film was relatively slow, Bloom was miscast, but the photography was good as were the costumes.  I thought the storyline was a little too politically correct and the ending was simply not believable.  A little more action might have helped.  Overall a so-so film but one that could have been better.
B000G759LW|5.0|This album is great. It firmly cements Christina Aguilera as the best voice around. Come grammy time Christina will be walkin away a winner. While most people think she has an entirely new sound and is all jazz, thats not true. Some of her songs are INFLUENCED by jazz and blues and its not in a huge way. Its still the same Christina we all love. <br /> <br />1. Into (Back to Basics) 6/10 This song has a bunch of sample and adlibs in it. Christina get a little vain in it though! <br /> <br />2. Makes me Wanna Pray 7/10 This song is very bluesy and has a choir in the background, Does not have a very good chorus, but a very feel good song. <br /> <br />3. Back In The Day 8/10 I think would have been a better song to introduce the song than makes me wanna pray. It has some neat lyrics and some adlibs in the begining. <br /> <br />4. Ain't No Other Man 9/10 the First single. For me i havent listened to it once cause its very overplayed, but still a great song. <br /> <br />5.Understand 6/10 one of my least favorite song on the album. It just doesnt hook you in. But still a fairly good song <br /> <br />6.Slow Down Baby 9/10 A pretty r&b hip hop influenced song. really good. <br /> <br />7. Oh Mother 10/10 A good ballad with a great beat. Its about thanking her mother for taking her and her sister away from thier abusive father. A highlight of the Album. <br /> <br />8 F.U.S.S. 9/10 a short song that was written for Scott Storch who produced songs on Stripped. He decided to write for Paris hilton's album instead of this BIG MISTAKE. Has a great beat and she sounds great on it. <br /> <br />9. On OUr Way 9/10 A great song about always being on your way to something better <br /> <br />10.Wihtout You 9/10 a vey good beat song. different from other songs, almost has a latin feel, almost. <br />  <br />11. Still Dirty 10/10 While most people think this is part 2 of Dirrty, it doesnt sound at all like it and isnt about anything Dirrty was. This is about how people arealways critisising her for being sexy. She call people \\"uncomftorable in your own skin\\". Very jazz influenced. A gem on this album. <br /> <br />12. Here To Stay 10/10 Another pretty Jazzy song. It about her not goign to fade away like other singer and how she's Here To Stay no matter what people say. <br /> <br />13. Thank You 8/10 A great thank you. It sample a little of Genie in a Bottle at the benging. Taking clips of the song that apply to her now. Its hard to listen to it a lot cause off all the fans in it. <br /> <br />14. Enter The Circus 10/10 An introduction to the second CD. Its (along with welcome) are about being in the publics eye and being a celebrity. The Circus is like Hollywood. Its inspired by a Tim Burton Film. It has no vocals by CHristina. <br /> <br />15. Welcome 10/10 this song allaborates on Enetr the circus. It talks about people who only like her cause shes a singer and what will happen when the linligth fades. <br /> <br />16. Candyman 8/10 This song was originally ment to be the second single but hurt was decided instead. A very sexual song and very jazzy. <br /> <br />17. Nast Naughty Boy 6/10 My least favorite song. it very sexual and doesnt have a great beat. <br /> <br />18. I got trouble 7/10 Probaly the jazziest song on the album. Recorded with a vintage microphone it sounds like it is really from the 40's. <br /> <br />19. Hurt 11/10 The standout of the album. it will be the second single. she preformed it at the VMA's. Its about someone close to you dying and how you have to deal with it. THe best Ballad. <br /> <br />20. Mercy on Me 8/10 not a standout ballad but still very good, has choir wich is a nice touch. <br /> <br />21. Save Me From Myself 9/10 she talks about how her husband saves her from being sad and always puts her in a happy place. <br /> <br />22.The right Man 9/10 She wrot this song about her wedding day and how her dad wasnt there to walk her down the aisle and how she is happy to have found the right man so her childrenwont have to go throught what she did. <br /> <br />Overall a great album, the second cd is a little betetr but this is AWESOME!
B000EHSVQE|5.0|I don't know  the intentions of the writers of Napoleon Dynamite.  Perhaps they just meant for it to be a comedy.  The first time I saw this movie, I only watched maybe the first 20 minutes  of it then got bored.  Then my Husband made me watch it again..claiming that I would like it if I gave it a chance.  I am glad that he gave me that chance because now we watch it over and over!! <br /> <br />I think that most of us can relate to the pressures of wanting to fit in when we were in high school.  I also think that most of us could probably relate to the scenarios that involved the typical \\"popular girl\\" and the \\"bully\\".   <br /> <br />To back up a minute to where I started this review... I did think this movie was very funny  but if you look just a little bit deeper..and open your mind...I think that there is something more there. Another message, if you will, to those who could relate to being different.  If you aren't able to do that, then maybe YOU were the \\"popular girl\\" or the \\"bully\\" during your high school years and maybe you lack the ability to \\"think outside of the box\\".
B000GFLAI0|1.0|This is boring music and the lyrics are 80 percent filler. In fact, I hate this CD. It's pathetic. The songs are too long. They're boring. Take a look around at how many people despise this album. The rest are just idol worshippers trying desparately to find something to like about it. Bob could have released any rubbish and you idol worshippers would give it five stars.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|Let  me say this as a huge comic book collector, X-men 3 got more right than wrong and was freakin awesome.  After hearingthe troubled past to how this third film was made, I think Bret Ratner did a amzing job of making this film. I This movie really did blow me away. This movie works. Its far better than Superman Returns.  ANyway buy this if your looking for some cool comic book action and fun.
0393317552|3.0|Diamond went on a search to explain why whites (Europeans) conquered nonwhites. Diamond's interesting thesis posits that geography is all. Diamond is no historian and he seems to think that if his thesis fails then the 'explanation' must be some sort of inherent racial differences. Diamond argues that the differences in geography allow different plants and animals to flourish so that some areas are better for agriculture, the basis of civilization.<br /><br />Diamond avoids discussion of religion's role in exploration and expansion, likewise capitalism. He also does not explain the differences between the successes of certain European countries, say England compared to Spain.<br /><br />Humans are apparently mere carriers of the inevitable results of geographic benefits. Ignore the grand theorizing, but learn from the facts he presents.
0553573403|1.0|The title's intriguing, the cover's exciting, the reviews give you high hopes. I opened this book, excitement pouring all over me.........and guess what I got for 50 pages (that's all I read): Boring diolague, no action, super-long pages, to much swearing and sexual innuedo, no action and, worst of all, the characters were idiots. For one part, none of the women were strong, and the men were plain dull as well. No excitement. It's almost as if GRRM read 'Assassin Apprentice', loved it, and said 'I'm gonna write a book that's as boring as this one, but even more so, with even worse things: I'm gonna make everyone buy it cause there's a cool cover, and then they'll be so excited, when they find out they hate it, they won't bring it back.'<br /><br />Overall, this is the worst book on Earth, and, unless you thought Tolkien was exciting the entire way (I do like LotR, but at some times it's boring), you SHOULD'NT Read this book. Don't waste your money. Please!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I love this disc by Tool.  Personally, I feel like the artwork alone is worth the price of the disc.<br /><br />I finally convinced one of my son's into getting off his copy for a few days.  Now I'm going to have to support the band (again) and buy this disc.  I have to say, I'm completely diggin' this record.  You'll find it contains groovy riffs so heavy I can see where it might require a back hoe to pick the disc up out of the music store rack.<br /><br />Tool crunches right into things with the opening song Vicarious.  This is a great song with heavy riffs.  I think it's placed perfectly on the disc (at the beginning) and leads to desiring further explorations.  It's catchy without being simplistic, and lays down some heavy grooves.<br /><br />However, it's much, much more than that. Each song is an adventure. They manage to keep the songs interesting and fresh by moving through different time changes but staying true to finding a massive groove and punching it through the speakers.<br /><br />Just when you think this new Tool disc is going to be heavier than the current water being brewed up in Tehran, they switch to a Native American sounding song (Lipan Conjuring) that flows gently and sets you up for the next dose of heaviness. I've heard a few complaints from Tool purists about this song (and the other ethereal songs on the disc), but I'm always up for a new adventure in prog-metal.<br /><br />I can't really describe this disc. It moves through so many different progessions of sound that I'm just gonna have to settle for prog/groove/crunch/metal.  Tool has effectively incorporated the sitar, tabla, and other effects that put them firmly in the prog-metal camp.<br /><br />And the bass work. Man. Justin Chancellor just freaking nails down some thick, juicy, lubricious bass lines that are at once massively heavy, yet slide all over you like warm Crisco.  Some interesting effects are applied to the lead guitar work, and I dig it.  The leads fit the songs and are not at all predictable.<br /><br />I don't pay attention to folks that call some of the songs \\"filler\\" when it comes to this record.  They're entitled to their opinion, but I prefer to let the artist be the artist and do what they want.  Sure, some artists are just ripping you off and filling the disc to get it into production, but Tool has had years to work this disc.  I rather prefer to think they put out a product they're proud of, and it's exactly the way they wanted it.  I'll take it!<br /><br />In my last novel I credited Rush and Opeth in the acknowledgements for inspiration and helping to drive me towards excellence.  Tool will make the acknowledgements in my next novel.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but you get the picture: Recommended!he songs and are not at all predictable.   <br /> <br />I don't pay attention to folks that call some of the songs \\"filler\\" when it comes to this record.

B00004W3L3|4.0|As a fan of all kinds of music stretching from groups like Genesis and Yes to metal bands like Queensryche and Judas Priest to more soft rock like Journey and Madonna I find Misplaced Childhood to be one of the best and definitely one of the most melodic albums that came out in the eighties. Linking the record's beautiful painted cover with the music it creates a colourful journey through melodic guitar riffs and solo, a deep and saga-like keyboard sound and Fish's catchy and beautiful singing. With its mix of symphonic rock and progressive rhythms it inspired bands like Dream Theater and also became one of Mike Portnoy's (drummer of DT) favourite albums of all time. But while many of modern day's progressive groups have more of a edge and aggressiveness to their sound Misplaced Childhood, and Marillion as a whole during this era, was more melodic and clear sounded with a relaxing tone.       The first long track of the album, Kayleigh, has a very memorable, melodic and original guitar riff filled with Fish's melodic singing and a high and memorable chorus, followed by one of the most beautiful and melodic guitar solo in rock history; a five star song that almost holds up the entire album on its own. I would have given the record five stars if it had the same spectacular sound and melodies on the second part of the CD and if they managed to end the record in the same perfect way as they started it. But as I said, it' still a very good record and definitely worth a buy for anyone who likes melodic progressive rock or good and intelligent music in general.
B000CBO04E|4.0|it's not a terrible remaster, nor is it a great one, but it's perfectly fine and conveys the music quite well. The Hoffmanites are like little Tom Cruises in the Church Of Steve, following nujobs like the guy who buys endless remasterings of the same title so he can rip waveforms and compare on his $99 JVC CD player abomination. Don't get caught into that groupthink, find out for yourself.
0307165485|5.0|I am 28 years old and still remember how much I LOVED this book as a child.  I read it until it fell apart, and my parents constantly tried to hide it on top of the refrigerator because they were tired of reading it to me over and over.  Buy this book for your kids!  I'm now an English teacher and, of course, an avid reader.  When my students ask me what is my favorite book, I name this one, because it was my first loved book.
0060751967|5.0|Roman Draganesti is a vampire with a problem - he has bitten off more than he can chew and has lost a fang. Shanna is a dentist with a problem - after witnessing a shooting she's become afraid of blood and now she has some people trying to kill her. Roman needs his tooth fixed, Shanna needs her life fixed.<br /><br />This book is a lot of fun as Roman and Shanna discover each other and get involved. Shanna seems rather dense not to realise he's a vampire and his household of Scottish bodyguards and their inept attempts to cover up Roman's (and their) deep dark secret. When Shanna finally discovers the truth, along with Roman's harem of 10 women, it takes some getting used to. The former monk is an expert in vampire mind sex and also a colossally rich inventor of such things as artificial blood (so that vampires no longer need to bite humans) and is working on a potion to enable vampires to stay up during the daytime. Shanna's life is down the toilet and she somehow seems to fit in rather well to Roman's bizarre household and takes a lot in her stride.<br /><br />This is not a deep book in any way, but it takes a fun look at the problems and opportunities in a relationship between a vampire and a human. Roman is stuck in a mediaeval monk's mindset about many things and Shanna works to help him to understand that he isn't the evil demon he believes himself to be.<br /><br />The baddies, led by a Russian vampire, get their comeuppance and hero and heroine come to terms with their differences, but there are pitfalls ahead (Shanna's family) which may link to another book Sparks has written that I believe has the same cast of characters to this one. Overall, though, it was really good fun and enjoyable and I recommend it.
0596007124|5.0|So far i bought about 30 computer books from amazon. This is the BEST!!!!!! First book that explains something real good but doesn't assume that you (the reader) actualy understood it so they re-explain it and attack the problem from a deferent point of view. I bought steven mezger's design patterns with c# book and read it cover to cover. It doesn't even come close to this piece of art although this is wrriten for java programers. I read \\"decorator\\" pattern in mezger's book more than 5 times and didn't actualy understand it. First time i read it in this book and i feel like a design patterns master! I'm thinking a lot about their teaching style. Its briliant!  If you realy want to understand design patterns even if you are a c# or c++ programmer, By this book! <br />Cheers! <br />Adi Barda
0307263118|1.0|I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book, but was sorely disappointed. Granted, the language was challenging at times (I kept a dictionary close by), but I just couldn't empathize with the  main character, Max. The story dragged on. I couldn't wait to finish it (I swore I would). What a waste of time. I'll be giving this book away at the next yard sale.
B00005JP5J|5.0|Oh MY Gosh, we LOVED this movie!<br /><br />Even my dear Norman, who doesn't like much - he said this is now on his top 5 list of all time.<br /><br />I must buy the DVD.  We just saw it in the theater, and I want to see it again.<br /><br />The characters were all stunning. Believable to where I could take one of them home and they'd fit right in with our crazy household.<br /><br />The dad, has his thing - hilarious. The little girl, Olive, has her thing - endearing, sweet, funny. The brother of the mom - funny. The mom - Toni Colette, love her! The grandpa - a hoot. The big brother - WOW did they find my son and copy him? follow him around for a day and steal all his expressions, eye rolling, clothes? his anger, his emotion? Brilliantly done.<br /><br />There were places of laugh out loud funny, that were so amazingly brilliant - Norman said he had a side-ache. One funny scene after another, but never slap-stick or silly. That is the genius of the writing. Not \\"look at me - I'm so funny!\\" never, but, \\"this is life - and it is a wonderful funny hoot!\\" very very well done. bravo.<br /><br />I never want to give anything away, in my reviews. I don't like to know anything about a movie before I see it, except maybe is it a horror flick or a comedy, but, I don't ever read the box at the video store - I really don't want to know anything that might take away from the surprise and delight of seeing it for myself. That said - I am tempted to tell you cute funny tid-bits from Sunshine - but, nope, I will not. Do see it for yourself.<br /><br />A must see for adults and kids over 15. (kids only if w/ a parent) Some swearing, some subjects not for kids. Do talk to your kids after, if they see it.<br /><br />What makes this so endearing, is how this family all love each other so much. Yes, stinking funny - but deeper than that is the relationships. The way the brother loves his little sister, and she loves him. How he looks after her, and when she put her head on his shoulder, when he was sad - I could cry, so sweet.<br /><br />The funniest, most endearing film in a long long long time. 10 Stars!!her head on his shoulder, when he was sad - I could cry, so sweet.  <br /> <br />The funniest, most endearing film in a long long long time. 10 Stars!!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season two begins where the first left off, and that's as straight as the continuity gets with flashbacks, false-starts, intro to the others along with some classic twists leading us all directions including a retelling of sorts of the pilot. Season 2 answers questions, while posing more. It reveals new \\"possible\\" regulars, while reworking old ones. Great!<br /><br />I really enjoyed my boxed set of the first season and I have been counting down until the release of this boxed set. The series really deserves to be watched in one or two marathons rather than shuffled network dates laced with reruns that distort the \\"confusing enough natural order\\" of the series.
B000H5U832|5.0|I loved CARS, it has amazing animation, good story, even though it is a bit slow in the middle, I think the pace could have been tightened up a bit. Not as good as PIXARS best film THE INCREDIBLES. BUt I realy enjoyed this film.<br /><br />So many CGI film today can't come close to story and quality of animation of a PIXAR film. Disneys first try, Chicken little fell short, just not a good complex story, not saying it isn't fun, just not good enough.<br /><br />And finally, why do they continue to release movies in FOOL-SCREEN (fullscreen). It destroys the movie and what the director wanted you to see.<br /><br />Do people actually realize they cut off the side of the movie to make it fit your square tv. I work for a national retailer, who's log is made of big red circles. I love when someone comes in to get a movie and it is ONLY in widescreen and they have to buy a widescreen movie. When I tell then that a 2:35 aspect ratio movie cuts off HALF the movie and I show them it on a TV. Alot of people are switching to widescreen now.<br /><br />If people quit buying fullscreen they will stop making them,

0937381888|5.0|After reading both \\"The New Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\" and \\"How to Brew\\" How to Brew wins hands down. This book just feels much more up to date than Papazian's book. As a pretty new homebrewer (only 1 year experience) I found this book answered alot of the lingering questions and concerns I had. It also has a good habit of presenting more than one approach to doing things and gives the pros and cons for each. This book also has a good amount of more technical information too, so really think this is a good buy for novice and experienced homebrewers alike!

B000007U6V|4.0|One of the things that strikes me about this 1974 release is that at times, it sounds a little bit like early eighties music even though it was released in the mid-1970's.  To my ears, this has a lot to do with the synthetic rhythmic element along with the (rarely occurring) mechanical and monochromatic vocal parts (in German).  There is also the selection of tone colors too - Kraftwerk seems to favor the colder synth textures instead of the warmer tones of (for example) the mellotron as used by Berlin School electronic composers such as Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze.<br /><br />The compositions on this album include the massive 22'42\\" Autobahn, along with the 12+ minute Kometenmelodie, and two shorter pieces in the 3-4 minute range.  The title track really is pretty good although there is very little of an \\"outer space\\" feel to the piece - a property that got me into electronic music in the first place.<br /><br />There are however a few moments on the album where the spaciness of Berlin School electronica turns up (as on Kometenmelodie 1).  The effect of this moment is diminished pretty rapidly however, with the bouncy rhythms and bright, cheery melodies of Kometenmelodie 2.  Hands down, my favorite track on the album is the short and gloomy Mitternacht.  I especially appreciate the experimental approach of this track and it is certainly the most interesting too.<br /><br />Given my complaining about the mechanical textures, the album closes on a surprisingly pastoral note with the track Morgenspaziergang.  This track does feature bubbling synth textures but disproportionately more in the way of acoustic textures including piano and woodwinds.<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty good album of electronic music and is worth adding to the electronic collection.

9707704667|3.0|If Mario Vargas Llosa wanted his latest novel \\"Mischiefs of the Bad Girl\\" to make an impression, lasting or not, on the minds of his readers, I have to say that he succeeded. First: his excessive efforts to give veracity to the story can end up disappointing those who are just starting to familiarized themselves with his great literary legacy. Second: his obvious insistence on getting so specific about the historical context in which this novel's characters move, can disappoint more than one of those readers who do pay attention to the details. Yes, both could end up remembering it, not like his best, but like a novel that lacks the creative height that is expected of this perennial candidate for the Nobel Prize of Literature.<br /><br />The numerous touches of realism, impregnated with actual past events, with which he tries to infuse elements of credibility to this story, can be, to say the least, overwhelming. The political and social information is excessive, doesn't seem to contribute much to the plot's flow and, if anything, restrains the progress of the narrative linearity. This abundance of marginal passages can lead to the boredom of those new readers of Vargas Llosa, who are not necessarily familiarized with such a bonanza of historical and sociological erudition thrown into a novel.<br /><br />In the course of reading any book, finding a pair of badly placed paragraphs or identifying details of mistaken time and places, are, often, powerful enough to discouraged some readers, who may decide to throw it aside. Sometimes, the opposite is true: the reader's critical eye, when noticing the incongruences of facts that he/she is familiar with, will try to find out if the writer is playing the reader a deliberate trick that, perhaps, will lead to a rational explanation when finishing reading the last page.<br /><br />And at the end,  if the credibility collapses, it is possible that the reader, as it happened to me with \\"Mischiefs of the Bad Girl\\", could end up unsatisfied, even if the author is considered by many, like Vargas Llosa is, one of the most prominent literary figures of the world.<br /><br />The amount of historically wrong details contained in a published narrative depends on the degree of eagerness for veracity that the author wants to bring to the plot. This novel is not the exception, and here is an example:<br /><br />Ricardo, the narrator and main character, affirms in Chapter III that Juan Barreto, his friend, passed away of AIDS in the early Seventies. Nevertheless, according to the history of the disease, the very first cases associated with HIV were not reported until the early Eighties, one decade after the death of this fictional character. Perhaps the author would like to associate this chronological error in this linear narrative with a not so much grave medical condition that the protagonist suffered and that is not revealed until the last pages of the novel. If that's the case, how would Vargas Llosa explain the mental acuteness he manages to give Ricardo in the multiple following passages where his brain shines with very specific dates and situations that go along with the historical realities of the more than three decades in which he moves his characters?<br /><br />Nevertheless, this incredulous detail that forced me to read this chapter in disbelieved, time and time again, doesn't have to be a reason for you not to read the novel. From Chapter V on, I found passages in which the main characters assumed very elevated human characteristics and feelings, with which Vargas Llosa, perhaps a little late in the book for some of his potential readers, manages to offer the best of his creative genius, the one that most of his prolific literary production, with some exceptions, including this one, has been associated with.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Si el escritor Mario Vargas Llosa pretend&iacute;a que su novela \\"Travesuras de la ni&ntilde;a mala\\" perdurara en la mente de los lectores, lo ha logrado por partida doble. Primero: su poder de convencimiento puede terminar desganando a quienes apenas se adentran en su gran producci&oacute;n literaria.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|First off, I should probably mention that I possessed absolutely no prior knowledge of the \\"Silent Hill\\" video games before sitting through this particular movie. Having said that, I must also point out that I followed the flow of the story perfectly from start to finish. So many had previously warned me that Director Christophe Gans had no feel for the narrative and that no portion of this overall amazing motion picture made any logical sense. If, however, like me, one is prone to utilizing their brain cells throughout certain cinematic fare like \\"Silent Hill,\\" these claims do not hold true.    Radha Mitchell assumes the starring role of a young mother who drives her daughter, Sharon, to the creepy town of Silent Hill to find answers behind the mysterious sleepwalking ailment she's been afflicted with. A violent crash precipitates Sharon's abrupt disappearance and leaves Rose, the mother, in dire need of tracking her down and ensuring her safety. She soon discovers that Silent Hill is not what it seems. A perpetual fog of smoldering ash envelops her surroundings, while freakishly twisted mutations straight out of H.P. Lovecraft's worst nightmare threaten and mill around every corner. We, the viewers, soon learn of a mass tragedy that befell the local citizenry, forcing those who were left in its wake to endure a ceaseless purgatory inside the town church. Evil, unknown to Rose and her daughter, has secretly summoned them to the borders of this formerly thriving town so that it may use their oblivious presence to infiltrate the forbidden barrier of the church and access these people who somehow escaped its cruel punishment.    I was thoroughly enraptured by every last reel of this production. Gans elicits a visual style that is both grotesque and undeniably beautiful. An unrelenting sense of dread resonates throughout the entire film. And when the much-debated ending rolls around, one finds that specific dread has not yet abated.     Yes, the door is left open for asecond installment. But, this represents one instance where I actually find myself welcoming that notion with open arms. \\"Silent Hill\\" left me hungry for more, much more, and I can only hope that any sequel we do eventually get will carry on the rare breed of quality that this film bleeds in abundance. It may not be for everybody, in all honesty. But it is exceedingly well made and is guaranteed to spellbind you with imagery you're not likely to forget anytime soon.

B000002AP1|5.0|Unfortunately, the only people who listen to the Stooges are the type of people who are concerned with the history of rock music more than music itself.  The type of people who've spent more time reading about rock music than actually listening to it.  The kind of people who organize their record collections by relevance.  In other words, rock snobs.  First, I'll get the rock history surrounding this album out of the way before talking about why this is such a great rock and roll record while attempting to not confuse the two subjects.    The proto-punk category is tough to define since nobody knew what punk rock music was going to be.  To further confuse matters, punk doesn't really have a universal definition.  For the purpose of this review, I'll define punk as loud, raw and nihilistic rock music.  The Velvet Underground is largely recognized as the beginning of punk rock.  The lyrics were dark and hateful and the music had some raw moments.  If you listen very closely, you may be able to hear those elements.  However, on the surface they sound much closer to Bob Dylan than the Sex Pistols.   The MC5 was definitely loud, aggressive and raw enough musically to qualify as punk, but lyrically weren't nihilistic.  They preached left-wing politics which certainly had shock value to most people at the time.  People who feel the Clash were the definitive punk band should check out the MC5 since the Clash owes quite a bit to the MC5 both lyrically and musically.  The New York Dolls had the shock factor that most people equate punk with and they played sloppier than most `77 punk bands.  The lyrics were trashy and sleazy enough to be considered nihilistic.  The only thing that held them back was the annoying piano that made their sound too large.  The Stooges had every element in place to fuel the perfect punk rock fire on \\"Raw Power.\\"  To describe their music as loud and raw just doesn't do it justice.  It sounds like the destruction of their instruments through overdrive.  Nihilistic lyrics?  It's not possible to get much more nihilistic than the lyrical content on this album.  On top of that, Iggy Pop delivered it all with absolute sincerity and disturbing emotion.  It's actually much more raw and hard than many `77 punk albums.  Punk unquestionably began with this album.  It preceded the New York Dolls 1973 debut album by a few months.  The punk bands of 1976 - `77 were almost universally influenced by \\"Raw Power.\\"  When the Ramones kick started the punk movement with their debut album, the only other things they added to the punk sound created by the Stooges was a faster tempo and they eliminated all other instruments besides the guitar, bass, and drums.    As for the remixing and remastering of the album in the `90's, it depends whether you value the actual sound of the instruments or the history.  Most people realize that you listen to music to hear the instruments like you can on the remix.  It's really tough to hear the history unless you've read or heard about it, which is completely unnecessary to the enjoyment of the music in reality.  There isn't any re-recording or anything else new mixed in here, so don't fear the \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" type of tampering.    Most record reviews of this album include the word \\"primal.\\"  That's accurate, but it goes even further than that.  Rock and roll had yet to achieve a such physical experience that this album provides in 1973 and few albums have been able to since.  Tapping into the human drive for sex and violence provides enjoyment for all parties involved.  It's entertainment and a sense of power for the instigator and a euphoric experience for the recipient.  The stimulation of those instincts leads to a break with the false reality of materialistic society.  In other words, living by instinct leads to true freedom.     The over-driven guitar certainly dominates the sound of the record which accounts for the violence people associate with this music.  \\"Search and Destroy,\\"\\"Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell,\\" and \\"Raw Power\\" have riffs with qualities that slash, burn, and rip with every touch.  The rhythm section does more than keep the time and a rhythm.  It gives the music a heartbeat and keeps it breathing heavy.  The bass lays down sweaty grooves and throbs along which demands as much attention as the guitar on songs like \\"Penetration,\\" and \\"I Need Somebody.\\"  To say the drumming drives the whole thing is an understatement.  Songs like \\"Shake Appeal\\" all but take control of everything in the song feeling like the rest of the musicians had no choice but to play.  Through the whole album the drums pound and snap like a stampede of wild bores.  Iggy's vocals style and lyrics compliment everything perfectly.  Sleazy, sick, hateful, strange, wild, and insane.  Whether if he sounds subdued or frenzied, he always feels menacing. The fear incited through the vocals heightens this experience beyond audio stimulation.    \\"Raw Power\\" is rock and roll at its peak potential.  It's just as essential as all other rock and roll greats ranging from Hendrix to Led Zeppelin to AC/DC.  It's too bad the album is only known about to underground music fans, but it's hard to imagine any of these songs on any radio station.

B000GFLAI0|1.0|I grew up listening to and singing (over the objections of my friends) Dylan, the single greatest songwriter of his generation -possibly of all time, and it pains me to see this sad day; Bob, under the spell of his Stetson, seems oblivious to the fact that it's all over. Someone please take him home.....
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I am certainly \\"running hot\\" in terms of documentary selection as it seems like every time I find one which is superlative another comes along and outperforms it. No Direction Home makes one contemplate a great many things. Perhaps the most immediate is the idea that there is nothing in this world that Martin Scorsese cannot do better than his peers. We don't think of the eminent director's name being associated with documentary, but he advances this genre in the same fashion he did short film with his forty-some-minute work, Life Lessons, within New York Stories. Here he accomplishes the impossible as viewers finally are exposed to the man Bob Dylan as opposed to the idol. Unfortunately, the results are fairly jarring. I'm always worshipped Bob but my opinion of him was definitely lowered by this portrait comprised of interviews with the artist and those who knew him \\"back in the day.\\" On the positive side, we again, just as in Don't Look Back, see firsthand evidence of his genius and how so much of what he did could not have been done by anyone else. His production during this brief moment of time was amazing. As a person though, we find him to be ruthlessly ambitious and opportunistic. Bob Zimmerman was on a mission to make it one way or another and nothing was going to stop him...and nothing did. The most disheartening element in this depiction is the lack of honor he showcased. He appears to have stolen a few hundred records from an old friend, and, even when confronted, refused to give them back. It is implied that he never, even when worth tens of millions, made good on this debt. This is unfortunate but probably reflective of the way in which young Dylan used and discarded others. Relationships seemed to be a means to end and never an end in them self. Joan Baez's observations support this as well. To please her, he merely had to invite her upon stage with him in London, but this was asking too much from a man about to become king. Yet, in the final analysis, he is a king and the person of the artist is always subsidiary to the works produced--at least in the minds of fans like this reviewer who will always love Dylan no matter what he does or says., he is a king and the person of the artist is always subsidiary to the works produced--at least in the minds of fans like this reviewer who will always love Dylan no matter what he does or says.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|\\"hostel\\" is a brutal, disturbing examination of human beings most perverse and illicit desires. i loved it. this is the first film i have seen in the theater in 2006, and if every film this year is as good as \\"hostel\\", we're in for one helluva year.<br /><br />the film was written and directed by eli roth. roth was a protege of director david lynch who recently decided to strike out on his own. his first film, 'cabin fever\\", was an ambitious but ultimately mediocre effort. while it had genuinely great moments in it, the film was all over the place tone-wise and felt like a talented guy's attmepts to get his bearings. still, i had hope that roth could make good movies because he was included in bravo channel's special \\"100 scariest movie moments of all time\\", and roth was so knowledgeable of horror that he had a comment about almost every film on the list. someone with that much love and know-how with the genre was bound to make a great horror film eventually. now he has. he has found a better way to mix horror and comedy (which is done by alot of filmmakers even though it rarely works; for every film that mixes horror and comedy well, like a \\"re-animator\\", we have hundreds of films which end up sucking, like \\"scream 3\\". roth has solved the problem by having \\"hostel\\" start out as a comedy (the premise of the film is very similar to the film \\"eurotrip\\", with both films having action take palce ina country called bratislava, which i am not too proud to admit that i have no idea if it actually exists in real life or not) and then descend into drama and horror as it goes on.<br /><br />the commercials for \\"hostel\\" make a big deal about quentin tarantino \\"presenting\\" the film, but really all tarantino did was raise some money for the film and co-executive produce. his involvement was minimal, except as a great marketing tool (and it seemed to work; this weekend \\"hostel\\" was #1 and grossed $20.1 million, a figure which indicates that the film attracted a wider audience than hard core horror fans like myself and the types of people who saw \\"high tension\\" in the theaters, lol).<br /><br />the plot is as follows : two american kids (college-age) and an icelandic man they pick up on the way, are touring europe with the goal of smoking as much pot, taking as many drugs, and sleeping with as many hot women as possible. one night they end up staying with a guy who tells them that a poor country in the former soviet bloc has the hottest and easiest girls in europe, and our three protagonists travel there in the hopes of getting laid by really hot girls. little do they know that this is all a trap for a business in the poor country called 'elite hunting\\", a service that kidnaps young people and, for a price, allows you to lock a person they have kidnapped up in a room and let you do whatever you want with them, supplying them with various weapons and surgical instruments. our protagonists start to disappear one by one, which is all the more scary because these characters are trapped in a foreign land where they know no one, and are truly alone to try and survive.<br /><br />i can't go further without mentioning the nudity. this film has more nudity than soft core cinemax erotica. in a day and age where films are gradually becoming more puritanical under the neoconservative cultural movement afoot, it's nice to see a film push the limits of R-rated nudity like the films in the 1970s did. the beginning and middle of this film, before the real horror sets in, is a veritable boob-o-rama, a feast for the eyes for a perv like, well, like me, lol.<br /><br />as for the violence and gore, well, let me just say that the film is not as groy or as depraved as you might imagine from the previews. the film IS very violent and has plenty of gore to satisfy the horror fans, but the violence is safely within the boundaries of the r-rating. basically, the violence is more graphic than the recent 'wolf creek\\", but not as violent as \\"high tension\\". what makes \\"hostel\\" so effective isn't just the gore, but the fact that most of the torture scenes take place in dark, wet, dripping, moldy, concrete rooms lit with a green tint as if we are watching a nine inch nails video gone horribly wrong.<br /><br />when we do get gore, it is not the usually enjoyable gore which looks obviously like a make-up effect. no matter how many horror filsm i see, the violnce rarely effects me. but you know what does effect me? surgery on tv. seeing surgery performed on TV makes me queasy (though i always end up watching it anyway). the biggest compliment i can pay the violence of \\"hostel\\" is that the gore feels less like a horror movie's and more like surgery.<br /><br />what made this film great rather than just 'good\\" or \\"scary\\" are the deeper messages of the film. as the film starts off in amsterdam we get our characters going to a prostitute in amsterdam, where one character comments on how \\"paying to go into a room with a woman and do anything you want with her is wrong\\" (that's actually a paraphrase and not a direct quote...i wasn't taking notes during the film to know the exact line of dialogue). this is the film drawing attention to the fact that sex and violence are both illicit desires harbored by humans, each individual harboring them to varying degrees. what the film is doing by showing the protagonists paying for sex and the villains paying to kill is that sex, violence, and all of human's most immoral desires are fast becoming commodities in our heavily capitialist world (the fact that the movie largely takes place in a former soviet country, one which is still fairly new in being capitalist after the pseudo-communist rule of the soviets, is no accident). we have put a price tag on our most illicit fantasies, desires which probably shouldn't be acted out, because when you have two people, and one is allowed to do whatever they want to the second person, that's not fair to that second person, even if you pay them. in part i disagree with this message (i support the legalization of heavily regulated and taxed prostitution), but i see the point, and the film is offering a nightmare version of the slippery slope we are going down. if we continue to insist that our basest desires be fulfilled, at any cost, we are not too far from \\"elite hunting\\". we have to keep oursleves in check, think morally and not just our hedonistic nature to feel good, or else the human race is doomed.<br /><br />too deep for a horror film? i don't think so. i think ti is this depth that separates the great horror films, like this and the first two \\"saw\\" films, from the crappy PG-13 horror films, or even the good-yet-unspectacular horror films like the recent 'wolf creek\\". even though we are only in january, i have a feeling that come this time next year this film will make it on my 10 best list (not the least of which ebcause horror movies hold a special place in my heart, and thus i am more partial to them than real film critics are).<br /><br />needless to say, i am recommending the film. if you don't like horror movies, or blood makes you queasy, or you don't want to walk out of the movie theaters disturbed and needing to discuss the film in conversation with your pals, this isn't the movie for you. you know who you are, people. \\"hostel\\" is a horror film for people who like horror films. if you are only a casual fan of horror, stick with mre mainstream, pedestrain fair. this is a haunting, deep, provacative, and intelligent horror film that still does it's job in titillating and scaring you...and it's one helluva way to kick off 2006.<br /><br />GRADE: Aat makes \\"hostel\\" so effective isn't just the gore, but the fact that most of the torture scenes take place in dark, wet, dripping, moldy, concrete rooms lit with a green tint as if we are watching a nine inch nails video gone horribly wrong. <br /> <br />when we do get gore, it is not the usually enjoyable gore which looks obviously like a make-up effect. no matter how many horror filsm i see, the violnce rarely effects me. but you know what does effect me?

0618551050|4.0|Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist, writing about the struggles of theoretical physicists.  The horrific troubles that theoretical physicists are having today, Lee reports, is due to one thing: the irreconcilable nature of a quantum reality and a continuum reality.  While the theoretical work on the quantum reality culminates in the very successful standard model of particle physics, built on the ideas of quantum mechanics in the form of theories of quantum fields and quantum colors, its particle approach, based on a classification of elementary particles, according to forces of interaction, is severely marred by a glaring failure to account for the most familiar force of interaction, gravity. This is where string theory enters the picture.      Before the completion of the quantum color theory, the concept of string theory was invented by physicists to do what the concept of asymptotic freedom now does more successfully.  However, it was soon discovered that string theory  unexpectedly offers a way to account for gravity, and this is where the troubles of the physicists really begin to take on unprecedented proportions.     The essence of this trouble, according to Smolin, is not just that the approach of replacing the theoretical concept of elementary particles with a concept of elementary strings has had mixed results, but that many of the physicists who continue to advocate it, seek to justify changes in the long accepted principles of science, in order to do so.      Moreover, given the early success of string theory, as a quantum theory of gravity, and its subsequent success in certain mathematical aspects that indicate that it is clearly self-consistent, and also consistent with the established physics of the past, it has not only engendered the greatest enthusiasm of the most promising young physicists just entering the field, but it has even captured the imagination of the general public, thanks to the efforts of its proponents to make it more accessible.    Consequently, according to Smolin, the effect of the rise of string theory, as an advocated approach to the \\"unfinished\\" quantum revolution, embodied in the standard model of particle physics, is to threaten the science of theoretical physics with its social and economic clout. Smolin feels that modern physics is becoming the victim of the phenomenon of \\"group think\\" behavior, where the popularity of string theory is more important than its substance, and he warns us of the serious implications of this situation.     In the end, this book is a very well informed, insider's, account of the trouble with physicists, more than an account of the trouble with physics itself, but it's a must read for anyone who cares about this fascinating drama.

0143034901|2.0|All the positive reviews of this book strike me as peculiar. Many suggest that The Shadow of the Wind will remind readers of other books. That is true, but only to the detriment of this effort. Zafon seems to know the ingredients that are supposed to go into a gothic literary mystery (there is a tragic back story, a mano a mano fight to the death at the climax) but he can't seem to actually produce them in a compelling fashion. The best he can do is make references to better novels. For example, the book opens: \\"I still remember the day my father took me to the Cemetary of Forgotten Books for the first time.\\" It seems like a risky proposition to echo one of the greatest opening sentences in world literature (Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude: \\"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.\\") A \\"Catalonian homage\\" or just a rip-off? It is the latter. Aside from getting the book started with this excursion to this mysterious Spanish Library of Congress, there isn't much in the way of magical realism in the novel. The plot of The Shadow of the Wind is convoluted in a way that is supposed to remind readers of a clever mystery with dead ends and surprises, but by the conclusion it seems ridiculous. The plot rotates around the hero's attempt to save the works of an obscure novelist from destruction. Every character in the novel loves these books--they can't get enough of them--but for some reason no one else in Spain or France actually wants to read them. The attempt by a mystery man to destroy every last copy and wipe away the memory of the author seems a little odd when there are only a few hundred copies floating around and they are hidden in mysterious libraries. The \\"reason\\" they are being destroyed turns out not to make any sense at all. The characters in The Shadow of the Wind tend to be one dimensional and cartoonish. The young hero is plucky and determined, his \\"Watson\\" is flamboyant, the girlfriend is beautiful, the villain is ignorantly violent. These one word descriptions tell you just about everything about them. There really isn't anything in the way of character development. Since the story takes place during the period of the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism one would think that there would be more thoughtful use of the period and context. The only way that is addressed is by making one of the characters a police commander, the face of fascist authority. The Shadow of the Wind is in the end a formulaic shadow of other compelling novels.ucky and determined, his \\"Watson\\" is flamboyant, the girlfriend is beautiful, the villain is ignorantly violent.

B000G2YD3C|5.0|Pure Reason Revolution has created a work of progressive beauty.  The challenge of taking progressive music to another place succeeds so well here.  Many folks have this one very high on the best releases of the year so far and it is easy to see why.  Not as dark as Riverside's great \\"Second Life Syndrome\\", \\"The Dark Third\\" contains beautiful music for those who love gorgeous female vocals in a progressive context. The vocals and harmonies are thrilling and fit very well with each song's textures and layers. The counterplay of the vocalist also works so well. The playing is stellar. With each listen you hear some wonderfully placed slide guitar, violin and piano within the cleverly crafted musical themes.  No weak links here.  \\"The Dark Third\\" is thrilling.  PPR has made a major statement with this recording.  Outstanding.

B000FQJAIW|4.0|I just finished watching the original version DVD's of the first STAR WARS film (and about half of EMPIRE), and I have to say that it looks better then any of the bootlegs that I've collected over the years of the original cut of STAR WARS, but unfortunately, it still doesn't hold a tea cup to the picture quality of the newly remastered mess of a revisionist version that Lucas keeps trying to shove down our throats (coincidence, I think not...)<br /><br />The picture, for the original version, has a slight, but almost ever present, veil of grain to it (probably the result of trying to up convert the Laserdisc masters, that is supposedly the source being used, to the DVD format) as well, the colour balance is tilted slightly to the red spectrum, making people look like they have bad sunburns at times.<br /><br />Also, STAR WARS and EMPIRE original version disc's cover art seem to have been conceived by a different person then that of JEDI, because you get these crappy art montages for STAR WARS and EMPIRE, but for JEDI, they use an alternate poster art, which is what they should have done with all of the discs, seeing as the original poster art is saved for the newer recut version discs (which is the same tired disc that Lucas has been trying to cram down our throats for years now, ever since his newer trilogy made it necessary to go back to the original films, and change things to reflect his newer version of events from the past... Confused yet?)<br /><br />Is it worth the money to buy these new discs, well that depends on just what kind of STAR WARS fan you are, if you can stomach the changes to the films that Lucas has made, and already own the first incarnate of the DVD's, then probably not, but if you're tired of bootlegs with questionable picture quality, and can get past the grainy picture of the new, original version DVD's, then it's a no brainer...
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I remember standing in line that hot summer to see \\"Star Wars\\" (no version numbers, thank you) in the theater, being C3PO that Halloween and seeing it released on television for the first time. <br /> <br />I too have the widescreen 'enhanced' version that was only available initially on DVD.  I have ALWAYS longed for the 'original' version that I experienced in the 70s & 80s - boxes around the tie fighters during the death star scene and all.   <br /> <br />As for 3 stars, I would still like to see 'Star Wars' alone without the enhanced version and with the \\"Making of...\\" instead. <br /> <br />While I thoroughly enjoyed Lucas' enhancements due to technology, It's NOSTALGIA we're talking here.  There WAS NO dolby 5.1 back then.  You guys born during Bush the First - get over it.
B000G759LW|3.0|Christina Aguilera has a amazing voice and a whole lot of range.  She also is a great song writer that tackles social issues in her songs such as the battle of the sexes.  I have always respected her as a artist.  The thing is, I don't like her material.  The songs all lack something.  Aint No Other Man and Still Dirrty are the only songs I listen to on this CD.  I really hate how she has abandoned her female power theme.  She has traded it in for a relationship heavy CD.  Most of the songs on here are not bad, but she never really goes crazy with this genera but rather holds back on most of the songs.  Only about half this CD can be called an ode to her idols.  The other half is just typical Christina.  Hopefully if she sticks with this genera, next time she will let loose.
0385510454|4.0|Too many people judge books based on an author's previous and best works, when they should be judged on on each book as its own entity. <br />If one does this than \\"the Broker\\" qualifies as an entertaining read, full of intrigue, great backdrop, likeable protagonist, and just a plain old fun read. <br />Will it pose moral questions after finished?  No, but it will give you pleasure for enjoying a story with an interesting plot, characters, and a satisfying ending, and that is what matters the most in the end.
B000HEYVD6|2.0|I stuck with the Camel Club, reading it to the end, but it took some measure of disipline to do it.<br /><br />Baldacci bogs this novel down with tiresome, preachy, rhetoric.  I wasn't bothered by his apparently left-leaning world view (after all, I'm Canadian) but the novel's endless preaching bogs down an already mediocre novel.  Much of the sermonizing about the state of the world comes in the form of dialogue that feels forced and unnatural.<br /><br />The plot itself is so bizarrely complicated that it's impossible to believe that anyone would ever devise such a convoluted plan or that it could ever work.  The ending ties up so neatly that it defies common sense.  Of course a far fetched plot and an implausible ending can be forgiven if the author provides the reader with a entertaining ride.  Unfortunately Baldacci's writing is so earnest and the novel is so tedious that by the time you get to the far-fetched, action packed conclusion, you aren't in a forgiving mood.<br /><br />If your politics lean to the far right you'll want to avoid the Camel Club because it will only infuriate you.  If your politics lean to the left you'll still want to avoid the Camel Club, unless you like suspense novels that are slow paced and far fetched.
B00005AREQ|5.0|This is one amazing fusion album that shouldn't go ignored by anyone claiming to appreciate guitar technique. I've heard faster guitarists 'shred' their way through song after song and CD after CD with the same blistering speed but this album puts Beck in a different catagory. One where technique and style take center stage. There isn't a single note on this album that doesn't show Jeff Beck to be an absolute virtuoso with the guitar. Cuz We've Ended as Lovers is so well done you can easily identify the guitar as being two people breaking up complete with all the emotional baggage that goes along with that scene. Easily one of the most overlooked guitar masterpieces of all time.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I saw my first Alias episode near the end of Season 2 and I then immediately holed up in my apartment playing catchup with rented Season 1 DVDs.  This show is completely addictive and you will not be disappointed.      The intricate storyline has so many layers that you will appreciate it more each time that you watch it.  Without giving away any details...you have Jennifer Garner as the leading lady playing Sydney Bristow a CIA agent.  There is nonstop action with secret CIA missions, romance, and a dark, mysterious Davincicodesque subplot based on the prophecies of \\"Rambaldi\\".  The acting is fantastic and there are so many characters on the show that I adore.      This is an excellent gift for people who like this genre.  There are some great tv shows that I would hesitate to purchase the DVDs of for fear that they would not be watched more than once but this show is NOT one of them.
B0000026KQ|4.0|You can't go wrong with a trio as versatile and talented as Beck, Bozzio and Hymas. \\"Behind the veil\\" is worth the price of admission alone. Also \\"Savoy\\" and \\"Two Rivers\\". Let's face it. This guy is the best. Noel Redding (Hendrix's late bassist) confessed in an interview that Beck was his favorite. Heck, you needn't interview me for me to say the same. My favorite album of his is \\"You had it coming\\". If you're in doubt, go with that CD. And do consider \\"Who else\\". In my opinion \\"You had it coming\\" is his best. Oops, did I neglect to mention \\"Blow by blow\\" and \\"Beck-Ola\\"? Excellent illustrations of his outstanding talent.
6304698623|5.0|My daughters (4 & 10) wanted to do SOMETHING today... but baking cookies or sewing was too much hassle for ME.  They began digging in the DVD cabinet and found this movie unopened.  We popped it in the player and spent a wonderful afternoon together watching it.  The cinematography was beautiful, the actress playing Sara was just perfect and my girls sat upright watching every moment.  The brief scene with her father in war was a bit frightening - so they hid their heads.   <br /> <br />They loved all the imaginative stories Sara told and they were disappointed when the movie ended because they wanted MORE. Funny that we have the movie \\"Annie\\" in the cabinet too - but I just can't sit through it with all the over-acting by the kids.  The Little Princess however was enjoyable even for mom.  My 10 year old would have loved this movie as a birthday gift.  She already said she wants to watch it again tomorrow.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|It is poignantly fitting that the man who directed Schindler's List should book-end that tale of Jewish pain with MUNICH, a film that tells another side of this people's struggle to survive in a period when the Jews have a state and the ability to answer with something more than simple suffering.<br /><br />Spielberg claims that the good storyteller exercises 'empathy in every single direction', a project that raises howls whenever it is applied to the Israel-Arab conflict. Or, as this film styles it with historical accuracy, the Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the same dry grove of the fathers' olive trees.<br /><br />Supported by star turns  from Eric Bana, Moshe Ivgy, and Michael Lonsdale and a haunting sequence in which Lynn Cohen plays an anguished Golda Meir - forced to the conclusion that 'every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values' - Spielberg's MUNICH manages to focus on the human drama played out by the soul of avengers everywhere. In the wake of the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, Bana's Avner is drafted as the unlikely lead agent of Meir's decision to prove that Israel must 'forget peace for now ... we have to show them that we are strong.'<br /><br />Avner carries out his role with taciturn determination, yet his eyes go moister and home calls the more compellingly as he scratches names off the list of eleven Palestinians who must be eliminated in order to show just how costly it is to mess with Israel.<br /><br />That 'family matters' is an affirmation of relative priorities kept by all parties in this film is a theme that Spielberg returns to at measured intervals. In the meantime, Avner and his team of avengers find themselves increasingly struggling with 'the mice inside your skull'. Resolution comes in the end through family itself. But it is a resolution that leaves stained, limping men, not the 'neat, durable men' whom Prime Minister Meir confesses to admiring in the film's early minutes.<br /><br />This is a film that must be seen by those who care about those conflicts that are fought in memory of the fathers, not least the one that still rages and promises to rage on in a small slice of land just to the east of the Mediterranean Sea.<br /><br />Spielberg has told the tale with astonishing evenness, though it is possible that this conclusion can only be reached from the more or less comfortable distance of this reviewer.  Empathy - even that which the director claims to have exercised 'from ever single angle' - hardly seems a virtue to the true-to-life antagonists of this particular conflict. For some considerable time more, blood will continue to flow in the name of the fathers. Avengers who rise up to even the score will themselves come to know the salt of their own tears, and trudge home to find comfort in family.lm that must be seen by those who care about those conflicts that are fought in memory of the fathers, not least the one that still rages and promises to rage on in a small slice of land just to the east of the Mediterranean Sea.

0316926345|4.0|Told mostly in a long continuous flashback by Captain Charles Ryder during WWII, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a novel about sin and grace and the fall of the English aristocracy. The novel is divided into two parts. The first section deals with Ryder and his friendship with Sebastian Flyte. At the beginning of the novel, Capt. Ryder and his troops arrive at Brideshead, an English manor and estate that Ryder stayed in throughout his college days and youth after WWI. Brideshead was Sebastian's former home. This part of the novel deals with Charles relationship with Sebastian and how Sebastian's family came to &#34;adopt&#34; Charles into their strange little world.<br /><br />The second section of the novel begins years later and deals with the romantic relationship between Charles and Sebastian's sister, Julia. At this point, Charles is a semi-famous artist who is married with children. During a chance encounter aboard a ship returning to England, Charles and Julia meet again. Married to people that neither loves, they soon begin an affair and contemplate divorcing their spouses and starting a new life. What follows is an emotional and spiritual struggle as Charles and Julia wrestle to find temperance between their love for each other and Truth.<br /><br />BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is the first Evelyn Waugh story that I have ever read. I have been told that it is one of his best, if not his finest work. The novel is full of wit, local colour, and passion. It contains beautiful descriptive passages that at times I read several times over just because it was written so well.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Waugh has a very unique style. At times the reading is demanding at other times it was frustrating because I could sense condescension emitting from the pages. At times this tone caught me off guard and caused me to distance myself from the piece. There are many readers who just can't read a novel like this very well or if they can, they won't enjoy. Even though I wouldn't say it's one of the best books I've ever read, I did, however, enjoy the book. It is a novel filled with tragedies and triumphs. It is a novel about life, love, and loss. It is a novel about sin and grace and ultimately understanding and redemption. &#34;No one is ever holy without suffering.&#34;ne of the best books I've ever read, I did, however, enjoy the book.

0780622650|4.0|Ok, I grew up on this series from its black & white debut to its final cut, so read on for a review of it if you're a true fan of nostalgia. <br /> <br />While Hollywood may indeed be grasping at straws for material these days, occasionally they find an old serial that deserved better than its camp beginning.  If you ever watched the original, you won't mind the slow beginning or the slightly off plot, but you'll love the special effects and wonder WOW!  If they had only done that in the 60's.  William Hurt just simply doesn't measure up though as the old John Robinson, but the  rest of the cast if almost perfect.  Mimi Rogers is just spectacular in any form, let alone in that tight fighting suit they give her.  Trust me, she would have been banned in the 60's for that outfit! <br /> <br />If you can get past Hurt's poor portrayal you'll enjoy the rest of it as a found memory of the original and get a real kick from spotting the cameo appearences by the surviving cast members.  I still enjoy this DVD now after several years as a good reminder of my childhood made anew. I would have liked to have seen a series revival here if they would have recast William Hurt as John Robinson and wrote a few descent scripts. <br /> <br />In all honesty it's pretty hard to image anyone taking up Guy Williams' spot as John Robinson.  His years as Zorro just gave him a commanding presence on the screen that's almost impossible to follow up IMO.  Mimi Rogers though really brings  spice to role of Maureen Robinson the way many of us would have loved to have seen in the 60's from a Mom and that June Lockhart just never delivered past that clean cut \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" Mom image of that day.  Heather Graham and Gary Oldman are outstanding within the roles they were given, but Matt LeBlanc coming off of the \\"Friends\\" comedy thing is the real star here for me and he passes the test to transition into a more serious role with excellence here. <br /> <br />All in all, this a great Saturday night flick if you're bored and anyone knows it's better than what the networks are showing now.  If you know the original, you'll get a kick from it. <br />
6304342160|4.0|Action and intrigue in this sexy movie underline the power of love to overcome the greatest fear- betrayal.  Corky is the jaded jailbird just trying to live in the world again who meets and is seduced by the voluptuous Victoria - much smarter than her glamour girl visage would suggest.  As they plot together the opening scene sets the tone for someone getting caught but all guesses are off as to who turns on whom with a surprise ending for the jaded set who believe that trust is the last element of the underworld.  Ultimate greed and evil shine through a high level mobster Caesar, Victoria's very dangerous boyfriend.  It is a clever plot with a redeeming ending to a sometimes gory mobster film with tense moments throughout and few expected outcomes.  Great plot, great acting, great ending!
B00005JP5J|3.0|Little Miss Sunshine is an earnest and amusing little movie. There are some nice moments, a wonderful performance by Alan Arkin, and a \\"slice of life\\" feel that reinforces that gut feeling (which turns out to be correct) that all of us are pretty screwed up -- which is  at least half the reason that human beings are endearing.<br /><br />This isn't a great film by any means. The dialogue is extremely variable. The characters are, too, veering from stereotypical to very interesting.  The acting ranges from okay (Toni Collette, who channels the exact same character, down to the facial expressions, she played in The Sixth Sense) to very good (Greg Kinnear) to Oscar-nomination worthy (Alan Arkin). The story isn't as tight as it could be either, but that's part of its charm. It's a loose travelogue rather than a Hero's Journey, and a gentle, poigant pleasure.
0451196716|5.0|Originally released under King's alter-ego, Richard Bachman, THE LONG WALK is one of the most haunting and enduring novels that King has ever written.  Apparently, King wrote the book when he was a freshman in college.  He had attempted to get the book published, but after several rejection letters, gave up until he was able to release the novel under the Bachman name.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of \\"Maine's Own\\" Walker, Ray Garraty, the story is set in a fascist America not all that different from our own.  Baseball is no longer the American pastime and has been surpassed by an annual event known as The Long Walk.  Each year 100 young men are selected from thousands of applicants to participate in the Walk.  The Walk is a walkathon where each Walker must maintain a walking speed of four-miles-per-hour.  If they fall below that speed or commit any other infraction (such as leaving the route) they are given a warning.  Each Walker is allowed three warnings.  If a Walker maintains the required speed, he can walk off a warning after an hour from the time the warning was given.  After three warnings and not walking any of the warnings off, a Walker is given a ticket.  When you get ticketed, you aren't allowed a potty break, a chance to eat a snack, or to take a nap. When you are given your ticket, you are shot dead on the spot.  Once you begin the Walk the only way to get out is if you get your ticket or outlast everyone else and win The Prize.  And what exactly is The Prize?  It's anything and everything you want for the rest of your life.<br /><br />THE LONG WALK is a brilliant novel that explores the depths of the human condition.  Most of the Walkers have no idea what they have gotten themselves into once they begin the walk.  It isn't until the first shot is fired that most of the walkers realize exactly what is going on: that they are walking towards their deaths.  As the Walk progresses the Walkers learn a lifetime of knowledge about themselves, about each other, and about humanity.  How should a person live?  What makes life living for?  How is it that a group of strangers can become closer than brothers in a few hours?  Is life just a game or is it a journey? The novel illustrates that even those who have the best odds and the most to live for in life can be felled by the same diseases, illnesses, and temptations as everyone else.  The novel also is full of social commentary, through the observations about the ever-present and ever-growing Crowd that surrounds the Walkers.  How can people become so hardened that they cheer people on to get \\"ticketed\\" right before their eyes?  This is just one of the issues that THE LONG WALK examines through the engaging tale it tells.<br /><br />The LONG WALK is easy to read and after the first few chapters of exposition and set-up becomes a page-turner.

B000A7Q2DM|4.0|Being an actor probably hurts this band as people are so quick to judge \\"actors trying to be musicians\\".<br /><br />It's a shame.<br /><br />I'm one of those naysayers who judged this band before really listening to them. Granted, thier first album isn't as strong in my opinion, but the singes from this album really aren't bad at all.<br /><br />And what sealed my enthusiasm are the recordings of some live tracks that, I believe, are exclusive to the URGE music download service (not sure though).<br /><br />Despite being fronted by a Hollywood actor this band doesn't come accross pretentious or fake. I'm pretty sure 30STM would have made it without Leto's name carrying them. It's better than most [STUFF] on the radio these days.
B000001DQI|5.0|This was my first Elton John album I ever bought in '74 and it remains a true power house.  From end to end it's just pure listening pleasure across a multidude of styles for anyone that's even remotely interested in EJ.  The only thing missing here is the slight \\"funk\\" twist found on Tumbleweed Connection in a few songs like \\"Amoreena\\".  But still today after 30 years \\"Harmony\\" still involkes me to tears for its shear beauty and I still laugh out loud at \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\". <br /> <br />There's just simply not a bad song on this album that I can see and why it never made it as a blockbuster I'll never know.  The double ablum set is must have for anyone wanting anything about Elton John and even for most \\"classic rock\\" afficionados it should be likewise. <br /> <br />Only bad thing about the CD release is that it doesn't have the gatefold pics that were on the original release in vinyl.
0099470438|4.0|I was given a list of books to read over the summer.  We only had to pick one from the list and this is the one I chose.  I went to the library and showded the librarian the list, this is the first one she selected.  So i checked it out and i started reading it.  I read the back and saw it was about a boy with autism.  While reading the book i felt like i was inside Christophers head.  It showed his thought process his fears and his happiness.  Each chapter has it's own personality too.  He draws pictures of how he feels and what he is doing.  Christopher loves math so instead of putting the chapters in sequential order (1..2..3.ect) he makes them prime numbers! (2..3..5..7..11) The Story begings when Christopher is blamed for the murder of the neighbords dog.  He feels bad about the dogs death and decideds he wants to be a dictective and find the real murderer. By doing this Christopher ventures outside of his comfort zone; he talks to strange people gets on a train and doesn't have a planed schedule.  Christoper has always had a truthful relationship with his father, his mother died in a car crash. <br />     Soon Christopher learns that this is not true. He sets off to find his mom and the truth about who killed the dog.  The end of the story is shocking but it keeps you wanting more.  To find out what adventures Christopher takes read this book! It's worth it! :)
B000002VCU|4.0|The Turn of a Friendly Card proved to be a very successful album, going Platinum and spending over a year on the Charts.

0060090383|3.0|I am a big Marian Keyes fan. I've read all of her books out of order and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I started out reading Rachel's Holiday and was instantly drawn back into the Walsh world. I loved how at the beginning of the book, Keyes has the reader believing that Rachel is not an addict and that everything is blown out of proportion. As the book progresses along with Rachel's treatment, more and more about Rachel's life in New York is revealed. The book got a bit dull with all the psychotherapy in the Cloisters, but as I got closer to the end, I couldn't stop reading and I found that I enjoyed the ending of the book.
B000005JU3|4.0|For years my brother and sisters were telling me this was the worst band in the world.  They didn't like more than a few songs by the band because they didn't like their raunchy, rowdy bar sound.  As years went by, my siblings left the house, and I began to listen to everything they told me they hated.  Now, the Stones aren't my favorite band, but I think I was sorely mislead.  Though not still my favorite band, I really get into the Stones now and then, and now is one of those times.  What fun, and what versatility! What incredible sense of style and musicianship that they have that deliberately wild sound!<br /><br />Definite highlights from their 70s and 80s career?  The pure classic rock bombast of \\"Brown Sugar,\\" a fantastically funky remake of the \\"Harlem Shuffle,\\" and the still overplayed but superior \\"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll.\\"<br /><br />My personal faves?  The beautiful soul of \\"Fool to Cry,\\" the epic rocker \\"Rock and a Hard Place,\\"  the disco-yet undeniably cool-swagger of \\"Miss You,\\"  and my absolute fave Stones ballad of all with Keith's perfect trademark guitar riff, \\"Waiting on a Friend.\\"<br /><br />There are a few songs on here that aren't so hot, but most of them really show the staying power of this electrifyingly rough, sensual, and entertaining band.  If you're not a diehard fan, this is a great collection to go with both volumes of Hot Rocks.  The Stones:  Like 'em or love 'em, you have to have some in your cd collection.
B00006RU5B|4.0|It is a long-held belief of mine that music today [...] All the new bands are either whiny and emo or just plain bad, and the older bands have this nasty habit of completely selling out. I've listened to both Audioslave albums, and some songs off of the new one, and I have to say this one is definitely the best and showcases most of their (remaining) talent. While Audioslave could never hold a candle to RATM or Soundgarden, it's above Velvet Revolver (which is a crying shame, 'cause Slash is a deity of guitar) and most other rock bands out today. Cornell's voice is obviously strained and weaker than it was in the '90s, but I have to say it's still pretty damn good. The boys from RATM do a good job of making some crunchy, loud riffs and sprinkling in some of Morello's crazy guitar magic. Not that I'm saying it's better than RATM's first album or anything... Before I liked RATM or Audioslave I was a Soundgarden fan, and when I listened to this album I noticed it was completely different from the creepy, driving guitars of Badmotorfinger coupled with Cornell's soaring wail. But replace Kim Thayil with Tom Morello, and it's actually very good. Different, but good. The rhythm section is loud and great for blasting in your car while driving (Commerford and Wilk were always good for that).       Cochise is good, although I can hear the straining in Cornell's voice while he's singing. Show me How to Live, Gasoline, Set it Off, and Exploder are the heaviest and probably the best songs. However, Like a Stone and I am the Highway are actually pretty good, and I was surprised I enjoyed them. All in all, Audioslave is different than the two bands it was spawned from, but compared to today's music it is high on the scale of rock.        As a sidenote, this only applies to their first album...Out of Exile was far more mainstream....and Revelations looks to be even more so, although Original Fire is pretty good.
B000002J0B|4.0|Houses of the holy follows the same path as Led Zeppelin 4, however the approach is looser and much more relaxed.<br />Folky riffs as much as thundering Blues-Rock, giving the album a lighter and more open atmosphere than its 3 predecessors.<br /><br />This is a must in every Led Zeppelin or Classic Rock collector. As a matter of fact the first 6 Led Zeppelin albums are all a MUST.
B000002UAR|5.0|\\"Revolver\\" meant a real breakthrough respect the previous works released by this fantastic band. This album is a full outburst of innovativeness and overpowering creativity.<br /><br />Measure by measure, we should include Here, there and everywhere among the most romantic ballads ever recorded by any single band all the way through; Yellow submarine became practically, a hymn around the world, which coincided with their psychedelic film of that year; Eleanor Rigby is one of the most original themes recorded by this ensemble,. as a matter of fact,  the overall lyric structure is supported by violins, blended  with a terrific arrangement for four voices; Taxman has worked out as inspiration' s device for many soloists (as the vanished guitarist Steve RAY Vaughan, for instance) ; Love you to accuses the Indian influence, that smartly was too, employed by the Rolling Stones in Lady Jane; And your bird can sing was another ballade loaded with cheerful inspiration.<br /><br />In sum, a rewarding album that never, but never will get old, because of the fact the whole inspiration that hovered this work was far beyond its own historical time.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|We awaited this movie with anticipation only to be VERY dissapointed.<br /><br />Hollywood......PAY ATTENTION..... $50 Million in special effects and $10 dollars of plot, screenplay and acting do NOT make a good memorable movie!<br /><br />This film is a textbook example of wasted potential..<br /><br />The set designs were great.. the atmosphere building was great.... the general premise was great........ after that it all falls apart.<br /><br />What we get is 2 hours of a woman running around in a maze of CGI and set designs trying to act scared and frantic.<br /><br />The actual images of what are supposed to be horrible are choppy, brief and incohesive.<br /><br />Never is a feeling of dread or actual horror created..... a simple scene of a blood-soaked (ex-family member) now-turned Zombie walking slowly towards a lone person trapped in the corner of a basement evokes infinitely more tension and suspense than anything in this film.<br /><br />MILD SPOILER ALERT......<br /><br />The plot here is basically a mish-mash of elements tossed together ranging from vengeful spirits, old West Virginia relegious fanatisicm, overgrown cockroachs, super powerful humanoids, etc....<br /><br />Basically it all become comical after awhile.<br /><br />If the plot had stayed focused along the line of a \\"ghost town\\" destroyed by fire and a \\"crossover\\" visit, then that would have been cool.<br /><br />But what we get here instead is \\"fiery ghost town meets videogame DOOM with some Deliverance tossed in\\".... it all erodes into forgetability.<br /><br />A real shame.... based on previews (which are misleading as to storyline).... we thought this was going to be a winner.
031286504X|3.0|This is actually the original novel (170 pages) and some additional short stories written over the next thirty five years (the last in 1989).<br /><br />As to \\"I am Legend\\", maybe I've read to much other horror or have been overwhelmed by \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", \\"Omega Man\\",\\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" and \\"Twilight Zones\\" up the wazoo.  Maybe all those mentioned above are the result of 'Legend', but I don't think so.<br /><br />What is different about the novel is Matheson's treatment of the cause, turning it into a plague like organism that had been around for a long  time and had suddenly gotten out of hand.  What he didn't explain was how they all survived without blood. Or maybe he did and I missed it in one of the medico-jumble explanations.  A couple of things were interesting like a cross only affects a christian, and that mirrors don't seem to matter.  He seems to take an inordinate time among some very minor ideas.<br /><br />But I won't bore you, you can do that by reading the other stories.  The additions are a hodge-podge, some good some bad.  Reminds me of Vonneguts 'Welcome to the Monkey House'; throw in all the stuff you wrote for Ladies Home Journal and Readers Digest.<br /><br />You have to read these fifties books with an eye on what pre-TV writting was like.  Much of it was of 'B Movie' quality and was only meant to be filler, as a result by quantity over quality, some of it has to be great just by the law of averages.
B000FIMG68|3.0|In the beginning I was as crazy as everyone still is about Lost. Lost is a good show but season 2 makes me question if I still want to watch the show at all. Some things this season dose makes me ether board or crazy. What makes me crazy is the story, I love the story because of the others, darma, the numbers, the hatch, and the MONSTER!!!! What bores me is the fact that theirs no more survival. The survivors now have a shower, food, tolit paper, beds, and more food. And that annoys me a lot!! But the story and the mystery still makes me want more of that life sucking show!
B00000IWVS|5.0|If I had to pick a single CD to win awed admiration for Martha Argerich, this Chopin recital would be it. Only 24 when she made these long-suppressed recordings, Argerich's musicality and dazzling technqiue defy belief. Every ounce of praise for her Third Sonata is deserved--it's spontaneous, flexible, intense, by turns tender and declamatory.  The most blessed quality is that she doesn't bang or harangue us--not always the case in later years. Her sense of urgency doesn't become eckless; the bursts of excitment aren't oerly explosive.<br /><br />My only caveat would be for audiophiles. Although an Abbey  Road studio recording, you get the feeling somewhat that Argerich is performing in a boomy hall. Also, in the loudest fortes there's mircophone shatter. For many listeners these drawbacks won't matter a whit, not in the face of an undisputed keyboard genius.

If age and sickness could wear down a voice of such power, a voice that sounded, in its prime, like it was a thousand years old, what does it hold in store for the rest of us? And you can't help but think that Cash's decline mirrors the decline so many of us have seen around us in our own families, strong men and women cut low with astonishing speed.\\" Andrew Gilstrap<br /><br />All of us understand that Johnny Cash was singing to keep himself alive. It has been told that the only time he felt alive after his wife, June Carter Cash's death, was when he was recording.

0783240236|1.0|I haven't seen the dvd version but I rented the vhs a while back and thought it was a real bore of a movie. Like a 2 hour soap opera with a semi gruesome last half hour. Nothing happens for the first 3 quarters or so of the movie but boreing dialog.  It seemed  so much better when I was a kid when a little went a long way.

In both movies they did not think things through. Yah you can say the special effects are good, and they are. But effects don't make a movie good unless the story is good. If I could I would give this movie a half star, and that's genoris onl because people say the effects rock, but I could not care less about special effects.

B000002UVZ|5.0|'Life's Rich Pageant' is the fourth R.E.M. full-length album, and like the predecessors, is accomplished.  This album, like the others, has a trademark.  Here it contains their most unconventionally conventional pop and rock songs.  \\"...Pageant\\" contains propulsive anthems and some of their most pop-pleasing songs of any album. Their accomplishments were enough to propel them to the top ten next time around.    The anthems are positive pieces of power pop.  \\"Begin the Begin,\\" \\"These Days,\\" and \\"I Believe\\" are uplifting.  Some of the songwriting improved, and Michael Stipe can hardly be accused of mumbling the songs this time.  \\"Cuyahoga\\" and \\"Fall on Me\\" are terrific lyrically and musically.  They showcase how insightful R.E.M really is.  The other songs are excellent as well, like the energetic and entertaining \\"Hyena\\" and \\"Superman\\"  and the thoughtful and hypnotic \\"Why Don't We Give It Away\\" and \\"Swan, Swan H-\\".  Song for song, 'Life's Rich Pageant' lives up to its title and delivers a C.D. just as worthy as most of R.E.M.'s best work.

It is really well done and characters are good. We are now up to episode 12 and looking forward to the rest. <br /> <br />Definately recommended.
B0002EXH4K|4.0|There are a couple of good things about the remix, namely the sound is more pronounced, the guitars are clearer, and overall you get more 'Deth in your ears. HOWEVER, why Dave Mustaine made some of the choices he did, I can't explain. For instance, Symphony Of Destruction is missing the harmonized guitars found in the chorus, one of my favorite aspects of the original. What was wrong with the way it was?  <br /> <br />If you've never heard the original, then better for you. Its still a great album. Fans of the original with fond memories, be warned.
B000GIXLO8|5.0|...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score. <br />In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better. The only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc, you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie--which is really not a big deal. I highly recommend getting these to those that don't own them yet.  <br />
B000CNFC76|5.0|I'm going to sound like a broken record, but I too am not a golfer....but I absolutely love this movie!!!!!
B000FUF6QS|5.0|This review is for the 88 minute version of the film. It is not patched together from outtakes, but the film as it appeared in its U.S. theatrical release. I have also seen the longer version on an ancient VHS tape, the additional 12 minutes or so do provide additional background regarding Sgt. Howie, plus the events of the film are added to and reordered so as to cover one more day and evening on the island, plus there are some extra verses in some of the songs. Having seen both I feel that this version of the film stands on its own. Admittedly, I'm not sure why those 12 minutes were trimmed for the U.S. theatrical release, but I don't feel it is worth the price of the box set to view them. The Wicker Man is less a horror film, regardless of the claims on the packaging, and more of a suspenseful mystery.<br /><br /> Summoned to a remote Scottish island to investigate the reported disappearance of a young girl, Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) becomes convinced that something is not right, but cannot at first determine exactly what it is. As he questions the villagers, every answer seems contradictory, which only makes him more curious and more determined to get to the bottom of the situation. The villagers are led by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who is quite cheerful and upfront, while still being evasive.<br /><br /> As the story develops, we see two belief systems contrasted, conservative Christianity as practiced by Sgt Howie, and the pagan \\"Old Religion\\" of the islanders. It eventually becomes apparant that several generations previously, the island had completely abandoned the Christian religion, and gone back to the practice of the worship of nature spirits and gods of the elements, etc. As part of their worship of nature, the islanders have a very unrestrained view of sexuality, which Sgt Howie views as simply scandalous, and causes him some tension when Willow (Britt Ekland), the daughter of the local innkeeper tries to seduce him. Her completely naked singing and dancing may cause tension of a sort in some viewers as well. There was admittedly a body double used for some parts of this sequence, but a great deal of it is Britt herself, and she looks wonderful. This sequence alone could have been responsible for the film receiving an R rating. Ingrid Pitt appears as the local librarian and she also has a brief nude scene in a bathtub.<br /><br /> In conversations between Sgt Howie, Lord Summerisle and others, some very interesting similarities between the the religion of the islanders and traditional Christianity are highlighted. On his way to Lord Summerisles estate, Sgt Howie witnesses some local girls jumping over a Beltane fire. Lord Summerisle explaines that the ritual is to insure fertility and appease the god of fire, by whom the girls hope to conceive a child. When Sgt Howie protests that this is blasphemy and poor biology, Lord Summerisle reminds him of the Christian account of Jesus as being \\"born of a virgin, who was herself impregnated by a ghost\\". In another scene, when Sgt Howie attempts to council the schoolteacher Miss Rose (Diane Cilento) that her education of her female pupils is improper, the Pagan and Christian views regarding death and rebirth are compared, and shown to be largely different words for the same thing.<br /><br /> The ending of the movie finally reveals the \\"Wicker Man\\" of the title, and once more, depicts a ritual which is the very foundation of the Christian belief system, but which Christians view as abhorrent outside of the Christian context. In this ritual, it is made apparant that Sgt Howie has become an alternative Jesus figure, chosen by the islanders because he is a virgin, because, as an officer of the law, he represents the King, and because he came of his free will (he flew the seaplane which brought him to the island himself). In a similar manner, Jesus was said to be a virgin, to represent the King of Heaven, and to have gone willingly to his sacrifice.<br /><br /> Overall, the islanders seemed very happy and comfortable with their life style and sexuality. There appeared to be no guilt or shame associated with their practices, they just appeared to be healthy and happy people who enjoyed their bodies in a natural manner. Society in general would probably benefit by adopting such an honest and healthy attitude toward their sexuality, instead of claiming that sex was \\"original sin\\", thereby attaching shame and guilt to what should be joyful positive experiences.<br /><br /> Generally, the movie painted a reasonable and for the most part, accurate picture of many pagan beliefs, especially regarding reincarnation and related matters.<br /><br /> However, I am not aware of any modern pagan group which practices human sacrifice as shown in this film, even though in much earlier times this had been the case. Two centuries before Jesus, the Romans passed laws forbidding the practice anywhere within the Empire. It is plausible that the practice of human sacrifice continued outside the Empire, and Scotland was never under Roman rule.<br /><br />Of course, sacrifice of one particular human IS the foundation of the Christian faith as it is practiced today, although from the Roman perspective, Jesus was not sacrificed as atonement for sin, but executed as a criminal accused of stirring up people against the Roman government in Judea.<br /><br /> Although human sacrifice had been outlawed 200 years previously, Christians of Jesus time were certainly familiar with animal sacrifice to Yahweh, held annually at the Temple in Jerusalem, and followers of Jesus continued the practice at least until the time of his death, if not longer.<br /><br /> Taken as a whole, the Wicker Man is rather reminiscent of the better episodes of \\"The Twilight Zone\\" in that it is puzzling at first, with a growing sense of ominous dread which builds as the story unfolds. In addition, the film causes viewers to think about their beliefs, and ask questions such as:<br /><br />What makes a religion \\"true\\"?<br /><br />Why is human sacrifice, even one time, to the Christian god acceptable, but not to other gods?<br /><br />How does the viewer feel about a god who is appeased by sacrifice?<br /><br />What if the situation were reversed, that is, what if the primary religion of our culture was the pagan nature religion, and the movie was about a small cult on an island who sacrificied a man on a cross to make things right with their god?<br /><br />Would we then view that ceremony in the same way as we now view the ritual involving the wicker man?<br /><br />Would a small \\"wicker man\\" made of precious metal adorn the necklaces or hang from the rearview mirrors of hundreds of millions of people?<br /><br />Would the title of this film then have been \\"The Crucifix\\"?<br /><br /> I found this to be a thought-provoking and completely absorbing film, well worth seeing.ry happy and comfortable with their life style and sexuality.

B000E97Y6K|3.0|It seems to me that the remakes today are far too serious and dark. This is the case with King Kong remake In the beginning,<br /><br />Carl Denam is a tongue in cheek film maker starts out the film with humor, a sheister who is very ambitious. He is one step ahead of prison, but has visions of success, and is very driven by his ambitions. This leads to a remarkable trip to an unknown island in the Pacific where  a horrible tribe and a horrible large monster gorilla live. After a tremendous fight with the horrible local villagers the film maker's boat crew manage to capture King Kong and take him back to New York where the film maker will be hailed as a hero. Only one problem: Kong escapes, and raises mayhem in New York, stealing the heroine while climbing the Empire State building and swatting off airplanes. The end is sad and the whole movie never rises much beyond its serious dark nature.<br /><br />Everything is WAY TOO BIG and grand, like your typical 21st century epic, with grand special effects and big, large scenes.  As I said earlier, the film has much too dark a personality and is much too serious. And it's waaaaaaaaay too long. Naomi Watts is beautiful and athletic, and is more adept in action than acting. The scenes of 1930's New York are excellent, the film maker does a good job on capturing that bygone era.<br /><br />There are times, when watching some of the scenes, that the picture looks more like an Xbox game than an actual scene, the computer generated backgrounds to my eye need to come along a bit more to look more realistic.<br /><br />This is a good movie to watch now that it's hit the bargain rack. Well made, with good acting, I just believe the whole thing could have used a bit more schtick and slapstick humor. It took itself far too serious.

0440418569|3.0|I loved the first two books in the trilogy. I was expecting to love this one. I did not. What happened?<br /><br />Mostly what happened is that Pullman shifted from a strong character focus to a book that is nearly entirely convoluted and complicated plot. So many elements are pulled in that he seemingly does not have time for the wonderful character work from the other books. Only Lyra and Will continue to be developed, but sadly that development is not enough to sustain the plot.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, and I enjoyed its message about not accepting authority at face value. It was just disappointing given how strongly the first two books affected me.
6301697707|5.0|TREMORS is arguably the best science-fiction/monster movie of at least the past quarter-century -- only ALIENS, a different sort of beast altogether, comes close.  Avoid the sequels (you have been warned), but don't miss the perfectly written, mounted, directed, and acted original.
B00005ATQF|3.0|I do not wish to compare this movie to other films about the Vietnam War -- I'll leave that to others who have seen a number of these films or have themselves been war veterans.  What I do want to talk about is the horrendously psychological brutal and vicious treatment of the soldiers, acted out in the first half of the film, as they begin their training, prior to being sent off to war.  Its no big secret that young recruits are put through intense training and perhaps this is necessary to a certain point in order to properly prepare them for eventual battle.  That said, the drill sgt in this film was more than brutal -- he was unnecessarily sadistic in his treatment of these young men, and this was of course most prominent with his treatment of Private Gomer Pyle. <br /> <br />It is with reference to the above, though, that I would still probably recommend this film to students studying psychology, sociology and even criminal justice.  The intense character study that we witness, involving the psychological breakdown of a young, non-intellectual-type soldier and the sadistically abusive treatment he endures at the hands (or mouth, I suppose) of his drill sgt can be a learning experience.  I have a Masters degree in Psychology and one in Counseling as well so that might explain the angle I'm approaching all of this from.  Motivating these young men is one thing, but psychologically and sadistically abusing them is something else altogether.  We've all heard stories about sports dads, coaches, stage moms, and other authoritarian-type figures abusing their power.  Seems that every movie involving a coach or authoritative military figure has to have that character constantly referring to his men as \\"ladies\\" or \\"girls.\\"  I'm not saying this is a ridiculous thing to do because I am a female, but rather because it IS a ridiculous and childish approach to motivating anyone.  No one, including young soldiers, needs to be abused in this manner and what can happen as a result of this type of unnecessary abuse is clearly depicted in Full Metal Jacket.  In fact, all one has to do is turn to the nightly news to find real life circumstances of a similar nature.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />

B000GFLAI0|4.0|Bob Dylan, one of rock music biggest icons now aged 65, continues to blaze the trail after his 1997 \\"Times Out of Mind\\" and 2001 \\"Love & Theft\\" albums. After a 5 year hiatus (his longest between studio albums ever), now comes the long-awaited new album.<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" (10 tracks, 62 min.) continues the trail of \\"Love and Theft\\", bringing early-Americana and even jazzy tracks, to great effect. The opener \\"Thunder on the Mountains\\" sets the table. Other outstainding tracks include \\"Rollin' and Thumblin'\\", similar in sound to \\"Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum\\", \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" (with earily similar lines to the Led Zep song \\"When The Levee Breaks\\") and the 9 min. closer \\"Ain't Talkin'\\". This is a great album, if a bit overlong at 62 min., but lacking the element of surprise of \\"Love and Theft\\", which was one of 2001's top albums of the year in my book. Dylan has gladly shaken the burden of being \\"the consciesness of the 60s era\\" (which he has made clear since then he never wanted to be in the first place) and he has gone on and do his own thing, regardless of public opinion. This great album simply reinforces that point. This is Dylan doing his thing, at age 65, and bringing us great music, his way.<br /><br />Dylan continues to tour the \\"Never Ending Tour\\", and we caught him a few weeks ago on his annual summer tour of minor league baseball parks. Even though this was very close to the release of \\"Modern Times\\", I was very surprised he did not play a single song from the upcoming album. But it was a great show, and it was my 16 yr. old daughter's first time seeing him in concert (and she liked it), and it just brings the point home that Dylan is timeless and his art will skip from generation to generation.

This full length version is the one to hear. \\"Private Joy\\" is another funky song which is another favorite on the album. \\"Ronnie, Talk To Russia\\" is a short protest kind of song. Same goes for \\"Annie Christian\\", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders. Not as effective as \\"Ronnie, Talk To Russia\\" but a decent track nonetheless. Overall a highlight in Prince's career.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|The consensus of critical opinion is that Chan-wook Park's  \\"Oldboy\\" is one of the true cinematic masterpieces of the past decade. In both plot and technique, it is, indeed, incredibly brilliant; on those points alone it deserves four stars out of five. I understand why \\"Oldboy\\" has so many ardent admirers (chief among them Quentin Tarantino, for whom Park could be suspected of tailoring this film). Yet, though I have a reasonably strong stomach for cinematic gore, I found \\"Oldboy\\" to be a little TOO sadistic. When you compare \\"Oldboy\\" with Tarantino's own work--\\"Pulp Fiction\\" and the \\"Kill Bill\\" movies--you realize that Tarantino's movies have a cartoonishness about them, a hip and ironic remove, that reminds audiences they're just watching a movie after all. There is no such remove in \\"Oldboy.\\" I have nothing but praise for the performance of Min-sik Choi as Oh Dae-su, the heedless, obnoxious but not really so bad guy who is imprisoned, tortured and toyed with for 15 years. I have never seen such a realistic, heartrending cinematic portrayal of abject grief as Choi's at the end of this film, when Oh Dae-su discovers both his torturer's identity and the full extent of his treachery. And this is precisely my problem: the film's emotions are too real. Obviously I'm in a tiny minority about this, but I simply felt too sorry for Oh Dae-su to get the requisite thrills from this thriller. Vincent Vega and Beatrix Kiddo are, as Tarantino intended, pulp fiction; Oh Dae-su is flesh and blood--and BOY, do we get to see that demonstrated, very graphically indeed. Reviewers have equally high praise for the other films in Park's trilogy, \\"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\\" and \\"Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.\\" I think I'm going to wait a while before I check them out, however. The DVD transfer of \\"Oldboy\\" is sharp and excellent, but the film has been dubbed rather than subtitled (not really a problem, except for the annoyingly chirpy voice of the actress who dubs the character of Miko). A bigger disappointment is that the deleted scenes and the bonus interview with Chan-wook Park are in undubbed, unsubtitled Korean.A bigger disappointment is that the deleted scenes and the bonus interview with Chan-wook Park are in undubbed, unsubtitled Korean.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|The 1976 Rolling Stone writer who summed this album and AC/DC up as \\"calculated stupidity\\" was definitely in the wrong side of the univiverse when he reviewed this album, and he will forever burn in the annals of Rock n' Roll history. AC/DC instead went on to define Rock in the biggest way possible--as I remember, even the 80's punks, who revolted against most commercial heavy metal, including Led Zeppelin, still liked AC/DC, or at least some of their songs. Looking back on that era, I remember  hardcore fans of The Smiths even getting off to AC/DC at selected moments! <br />Today, the influence of the group is unquestionable, and I think all the recognition, critical and otherwise, is warranted.  <br />\\"High Voltage,\\" in short, is one of those albums that, as you grow up, and if you are in a place in your life in those tender years to be touched by music, that you kind of live by. I never questioned its greatness too much, and still don't. These days, you'd call it \\"classic,\\" in every respect--the look, the sounds, the approach, the attitude, the virtuosity, etc. This is the first chapter in the \\"Testament\\" of AC/DC. There is no bad song on this album. Where Back in Black was a triumph of and over the shadows of life and death--and is almost a spiritual experience in that regard--High Voltage is like clear, springtime jubilation. Ultimately, \\"Jubilant\\" is the one word that I use to describe this album. This is the glorious birthing of AC/DC, and it will continute to captivate and capture the spirit of all youth hence. <br /> <br />

In this season we find why Jack is so reluctant to trust Kate, why Hurley was in the mental instituition, why Rose doesnt want to leave the island at, how Jin and Sun first met, why the nigerian plane is in the middle of the island, and much much more.  If you are a fan of Lost, this purchase is a no brainer.  Save your money by buying this over the internet.

B00005JMXX|3.0|THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW has widely been ridiculed as one of the silliest movies of recent years and was the recipient of utterly awful reviews when it was released.  Having heard all of this, I was hardly tempted to watch it for some time.  But recently I was in the mood for a disaster movie, and having recently watched the Val Guest British classic THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE, I was interested in seeing it destroyed by ice as well.  Although this is one of the most thoroughly panned films of recent years by critics, I thought it was, in fact, a very entertaining film.<br /><br />Yes, the plot is silly.  Rather, it is impossible precisely as presented.  I am not an authority on the subject, but I have read that the central scenario is not impossible, but that it would take place over a much longer time frame than seen in the film.  An ecological disaster is not impossible, but it won't occur in a week.<br /><br />The film has a decent cast, but honestly, who cares?  A film like this is not driven by the cast but by the special effects.  The effects found in this film are among the most memorable one will find, with one exception.  The exception is the CGI for the wolves that attack Jake Gyllenhaal and his friends.  They look absurdly artificial and computer generated, which is made worse by the fact that so many other things in the movie look so great.  There is a great deal of silliness:  the ship that floats up Fifth Avenue and comes to a halt in front of the New York Public Library.  It is absolutely impossible to plot a feasible path for a ship to take to reach the library.<br /><br />Still, once one gets past the silliness, the film is unquestionably quite entertaining.  The tornadoes hitting Los Angeles are amazingly well done and fun to watch while one scene after another is a delight to watch.  We all enjoy movies in which the world comes to an end or at least comes to an end as we know it.  As a kid I loved reading J. G. Ballard's novels that imaginatively bring the world to a close in one way or another, whether by wind, drought, or water.<br /><br />Unless you are completely unable to get past an initial absurd premise, I definitely thing most people will enjoy this.  Besides, much has occurred the past two years to make the idea of ecological disaster more plausible.  Numerous books detailing global warming have appeared, an official in the Bush administration has finally acknowledged that global warming is real, there have been numerous fractures in the Religious Right over global warming, and even Pat Robertson has stated that he was wrong on global warming and now acknowledges that it is caused by humans and requires that we dramatically reduce greenhouse emissions.  And Al Gore released his superb documentary.  So while we won't get any ecological disasters precisely as found in this film, it isn't as unthinkable as it used to be.natively bring the world to a close in one way or another, whether by wind, drought, or water.   <br /> <br />Unless you are completely unable to get past an initial absurd premise, I definitely thing most people will enjoy this.

6305433909|4.0|I love this movie. Both Sister Acts are good family films. <br />SA1 has good music. But SA2 has Great music! The arrangements of <br />old standards like \\"Joyful, Joyful\\", \\"Oh Happy Day\\", \\"His Eye is on the Sparrow\\" by Roger Emerson are sheer genius. Remakes of Temptations, Supremes, and James Brown songs are great fun, <br />too. There are even some new numbers- and a little Aretha. But the assemblage of talent in the choir is first class-their enthusiam is absolutely contagious! The story line has been criticized by some reviewers, but I thought it was pretty good (different strokes, I guess). OK, so it's not Les Miserables- so what? It's great fun! Give it a try- bet you'll like it, too!  <br />
B000FVBLEI|4.0|I first caught All That Remains when the group opened up for Arch Enemy in late 2005, and I have to say that for a band that had escaped me for some reason until that night that I was glad to be able to correct the error of my ways. The group recently ended a string of successful touring spots and has just unleashed \\"The Fall Of Ideals\\" on an unsuspecting Metal world. It's a killer release by the Massachusetts based \\"Metal core\\" labeled band, and it is so good and heavy that they actually transcend that aspect of the genre and should be referred to more as a Melodic Death Metal act. When I listened to the album for the first time I immediately thought along the lines of music that is found in bands like Scar Symmetry, Soilwork and Mercenary for those in need of an example. It is a great transition if you think about it, for there are too many Metal/Grind core bands around right now and most are less than stellar at what they do. Instead of bold experiment they simply choose to remain the same. As a listener, this makes them harder to differentiate and overall boring once you hear too much of the same old thing. Musically, All That Remains will show that they are not strictly a \\"core\\" level band either as each member of the band shows a level of musicality that will impress fans of heavy music and also those that lean more toward the Progressive end. It's a change that the band has consciously aimed for; citing that \\"this is a new way to look at an old friend\\". I truly believe that we need more friends like this in Metal. The use of melody should not make you think that there is no punch to them for opener \\"This Calling\\" begins with a double bass run that will knock your teeth out. Drummer Shannon Lucas should be complimented for his skills on the album.<br /><br />The band is made up of Phil Labonte (vocals), Mike Martin (guitars), Oli Herbert (guitars), Shannon Lucas (drums) and Jeanne Sagan (bass). Labonte is known to many already, as he fronted the Metal band Shadows Fall before Brian Fair took the spot and progressed the band into their future. It was a side project with Oli Herbert but like many good things became something entirely different. While Labonte does the required growls to perfection, the standout part for his voice to me would be his strong melodic vocal input all over this album. It takes the material to a different level, because I feel many listeners are getting worn on the growling as the whole song. Thankfully there is an even mix in almost every track along with shredding that will peal the skin off your bones. I liked too much of the album to sit and denote track for track but a couple of more impressive ones were \\"It Dwells In Me\\" and \\"We Stand\\". All That Remains is on a great path with this album and I think going forward I would like to see more of the melodic vocals and have the Black style compliment them instead of vice-versa. Its time for a new wave of American Metal to begin and All That Remains seems very ready to lead this charge.hadows Fall before Brian Fair took the spot and progressed the band into their future.

B000067FP7|5.0|Great film, the makers knew what they were doing when they made this. I won't spoil it for you if you have not seen it. I will conclude this review by saying you should go and buy this Special Edition DVD of the film.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|I don't play video games and knew nothing about the game, Silent Hill. So I watched this film with very few expectations other than what I saw in the commercials. I'm a sucker for mysteries and horror films so when Silent Hill became available on DVD, I rented it.<br /><br />There are elements of the plot that make this film interesting and intriguing. A mining town abandoned for 30-years because of a coal fire still burning underground sounds like an excellent setting for creepy things to occur. Plus it takes place in West Virginia in the US of A. There aren't a lot of haunted locations in the U.S.--too much money to be made by sanitizing and developing them--so this interested me.<br /><br />For the first 40-minutes or so, I really wanted to understand what was going on. What had happended to the town? What was so horrible. Was Rose really experiencing these things and why.<br /><br />Then there was about 30 minutes too long basically showing us Rose and the leather motorcycle lady cop running away from various demons. Creepy, grotesque demons to be sure. But after awhile, it got old, at least for me. It was like, \\"Oh here's another scary, mutant creature making Rose scream. Whatever.\\"<br /><br />Finally, FINALLY, we find out what's going on and it's really unsatisfying. Another Japanese-style ghost/demon taking revenge on those that wronged her. In the Ring, the vengeful spirit was interesting and cool. But it's been done way too many times, not particularly well, and the novelty has worn off. It's not a bad plot device but it doesn't make up for an unoriginal story.<br /><br />The film gets 3-stars for kick-butt creepy atmosphere and effects. They did an amazing job making Silent Hill the setting of your worst nightmares. But the slow pacing, redundant scenes, and dirivative story line keep the movie from truly satisfying.
B00004Z4SD|2.0|With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a \\"blind date\\" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.<br /><br />What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the clich&eacute; use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.<br /><br />Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' \\"Looking at America\\" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just \\"played it safe\\".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****gonist for the feature.

B0006J28MI|4.0|This is what you might call as Macaulay Culkin's farewell to childhood, or his life as a child actor, by making this movie, and then not appearing in another movie for 9 long years, and even in that period of time, there might have been plenty of fans that forgotten him until he made and released Party Monster in 2003, but that movie really doesn't have much to do this movie, and I bet even at the end of 1994, that people where saying and thinking that this would be Macaulay Culkin's last ever movie or even as a child actor, even through he reached the age of 14 on August 26th, 1994. The movie is Richie Rich, where you might also see two cent signs in place of the two c's in the title. At the beginning of the movie Ritchie Rich is born to Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Regina Rich (Christine Ebersole) , and then 12 years later it looks like he has everything, he has his own butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde), and is the richiest kid in the world, but where are his friends? Oh yeah, he doesn't have any, not like he is mean, his father saved a company from going out of busines, but can't be at the grand re-openning so he sends Richie who even spends time playing baseball, and spots local kids playing baseball, but because of his busy schedule he is not allowed to even join in the game. So he decicees that this is the missing part of his life. And along being the heir to his family riches, he even has a cool satellite-driven Dadlink, that is acomputer system, that tracks down Richard from wherever he is, so Richie can chat with him as he wishes too, when his Dad is out on the road. And there is family inventor Professor Keenbean (Michael McShane), who is apart of Richie's life, and is his teacher in chemistory class. But then his whole family including Richie is invited to tea and crimpits with the queen of England, and his Dad's own presonal advisor (John Larroquette), has had enough of his employer's philanthropic investments and charitable contributions, and he wants to get to thier hidden vault, so he decides to kill the family by placing a gift in thier airplane with a bomb, but when Richie looks upset, about his lastest go round trying to make friends, Cadbury asks his Mom's premisson to keep him home from the trip, so he can keep his busy with a schedule and she agrees, and then they take off, unaware of wait is waitng for them on the plane. Cadbury even manges to convince a kids that they saw play basbeall, and tried to make friends, but they turned him down the day before, to play with Richie, and well you should get where the movie is going from here, but please if oyu want to watch the movie, watch it to find out what happens next, and if you like any of the cast member,s that is good enough reason to watch this film.
0141301104|4.0|Dahl delivers again with the story that will capture your imagination within the first chapter. He effectively creates a fantastic, yet believable world in which your discomfort compels you to read on. Dahl's description of witches and their perception of children is just plain disturbing, but in a good way!  <br /> <br />The reason for four stars is that I thought the ending was a bit rushed. He should either have dropped that one plot element he introduced at the very end, or explored it a bit further. Given that he introduced it so late in the book, it felt awkward. Some would say he intimated at the beginning of the book and that perhaps would be a fair rebuttal.
B00005JOML|2.0|The film is titled `Miami Vice.' and the story goes like this;  <br /> <br />The two \\"buddies\\" who don't really look like working together in the police suddenly go undercover to reveal the `story' of the drug dealers. Those `bad' guys all speak English with heavy accent, live in a luxurious house with a beautiful woman who is also his lover. And ... but wait. Isn't this familiar? <br /> <br />Because of the acute shortage of good script, Hollywood decided to call this clichéd story `Miami Vice,' not knowing that what they are doing has been done repeatedly.  <br /> <br />[SONNY AND RICO] And Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as Sonny and Rico? And Gong Li as Sonny's lover? I'm ready to admit they are all gifted actors, but there is nothing between Farrell and Foxx that makes me believe their friendship, nor chemistry between Li and Farrell. It is terribly embarrassing to see Gong Li, internationally acclaimed actress, doing these obligatory `love scene' that should be more suitable for cheesy melodramas.  <br /> <br />If director Michael Mann intended to create a melodrama (which should not be necessarily cheesy, however), his new `Miami Vice' is a total failure, because melodramas usually have a much more interesting story. Mann's stylish images barely hide the fact, but the film is really a standard cop thriller with formulaic set-pieces. In his previous `Collateral' it worked thanks to the exceptional acting from the leads, but without the tension between the characters, you just cannot expect another success.  <br /> <br />Feature film version `Miami Vice' based on the hugely popular 80s TV series should be seen as a completely independent project, Even as such it lacks originality, and is short of actions. The film is beautifully shot (by Dion Beebe, `Chicago'), but I don't see the reason this film version had to be made, let alone to be called `Miami Vice.'
B00030590I|4.0|After reading a few reviews for this movie I thought it was gonna be huge, epic battles.  Wrong.  There are some great battle scenes and the colors and images are breathtaking.  But, this movie is more of a love story than a war story.  I liked the way it was told, although it will probably confuse some people.  Jet Li is a great actor/martial artist/stunt coordinater/producer.  The other actors are good too.   <br /> <br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is probably the hype.  While all the battle scenes are great, for me, they ended up ending too soon.  I also wasn't expecting the complex story, which I liked, but there were just a few too many twists and turns thrown in.   <br /> <br />Overall if you want to see a good martial arts/romance/historical   <br />piece then you should see this.  Its a good movie to be sure, a bit confusing, but a good film none the less...
B000GFLKF8|4.0|This was a pretty good movie.  I enjoyed the story line.  It had many twists and turns that forced the viewer to pay attention. <br /> <br />Defintely worth watching.
0780622553|5.0|Incredibly imaginative, ground-breaking visual effects, terrific acting, heavily atmospheric, crisply paced and written... it just works on every single level and it works brilliantly. Seeing this in the cinema the first time, my mouth was agape for a goodly portion of the film, particularly the \\"tuning\\" of the city sequences and the very memorable climax. This simply in one of the great Sci-Fi films of all time, and also goes into history with films like DARKMAN and THE MATRIX as the best comic-book films that weren't comic books, which is mostly due to Proyas' direction and the co-writing of David Goyer, who wrote the BLADE films, co-wrote BATMAN BEGINS, and has worked on several different actual comics over the years. Great, great film.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|Pointless! since 2004 - 2006 there will be 3 verions of these films. not to mention release in 3D and release in 2007 for 30 years of star wars. i WAS a big fan but George Lucas is just milking star wars. Just stick to one set. i wont be buying these because i know if i do it will be re re re re re re released time and time again. waste of money if you have a set stick to it.
B000GNOM78|5.0|I've watched the recent HD DVD version of this movie and found the picture quality excellent. The colors are richer and the overall quality appears to make the picture jump out at times when viewed with the Toshiba A x1 player. <br /> <br />I don't think it is fair to give the movie a low rating, as one reviewer did, based on the fact that it is an older movie. Comparing any older movie to modern day production values is misleading and inaccurate. Following this comparisson, one would have to give a low rating to all movies not done in the past few years.  <br /> <br />Enter The Dragon was innovative for its time and utilized production methods that were top  quality for its time.  <br />The transfer itself is the citeria that the review should be judged on, which in this case is done quite well.  <br /> <br />As for the comparrison to the 60's James Bond movies, the HD version of You Only Live Twice is superb. Yes, the fashion, music, dialogue,... are not modern day; how can  a film escape it's own time period. However, the Connery Bond movie screenplays far outweigh the childish, comic book portrayals in the curent Bond films with only protracted stunt sequences to amuse a child like mentality. <br /> <br />It is interesting that for an \\"outdated\\" film like Enter the Dragon, it's character depictions, plot and fight choreography are most often duplicated by today's style of martial art movies. <br />Have today's \\"highly evolved\\" movies no original ideas other than replacing Lee's actual fighting skill, speed, gracefulness and charasmatic screen presence with acrobatic clowns whose abilities are enhanced with wire work.  <br /> <br />The picture and sound quality  of the HD Enter the Dragon is most striking when viewed on the Toshiba player. It is certainly more entertaining then watch a highly detailed HD version of the inane Pitch Black or recent Jackie Chan, Jet Li films whose silly plot lines and poor acting are to be ingnored just to impress friends coming over to view how amazingly life like the picture quality is!  <br /> <br />Once the novelty of watching films on the superior HD DVD passes, classic movies will always stand on their own merit.
B00005JMJG|3.0|...the plot goes nowhere! I found this movie to be extremely confusing, jumping from scene to scene and from one point in time to another and back again without having anything coherent holding it together. However, having said that, Jim Carrey is great. He looks absolutely adorable with his 5 o'clock shadow and longish hair and does none of the crazy antics that he's known for in his comedies. I thoroughly enjoyed him in a serious role and would like to see him do more, but in a movie that also has a well-told story that is understandable and more engaging for the audience. Kate Winslet also plays an off-beat part and does so with aplomb.    See it if you're a Jim Carrey fan or if you're not but would like to watch something that might change your mind about him (at least this movie goes to show that he has genuine talent and is amazingly multifaceted); see it for the way the leads play their roles, which are very different from their normal fare.
B000002GB4|5.0|This is the first Tommy Shaw album and he truly makes a difference here. You can also tell that these guys had a great time making this album. As Crystal Ball would go gold. <br /> <br />Here is my review: <br /> <br />Put Me On (12/10) A nice moderate and fun rocker to start the album out with some great guitar work. <br /> <br />Mademoiselle (22/10) A Styx classic to this day. A beautiful upbeat love song with great vocal work by all the members. <br /> <br />Jennifer (14/10) Another great moderate rocker about a girl. Great vocals by Dennis on this song. <br /> <br />Crystal Ball (20/10) Another Styx Classic Tommy sings it does a great job. The keyboard solo by Dennis is spectacular and so perfect for this song. <br /> <br />Shooz (28/10) Another Styx classic and my favorite song off this album. The guitar work and solos by both Tommy and JY are fantastic the vocals are good. But I especially like John's drums on this song. <br /> <br />This Old Man (8/10) Probably their worst song on this album but that doesn't mean its bad. A slow song and good vocals by Dennis make me give this a 8 of 10. <br /> <br />Clair De Lune/Ballerina (10/10) I nice soft song by Dennis to finsh off the album with.
B00004VVNB|5.0|This movie is enthralling from start to finish. Awesome, timeless special effects, great acting, a great plot and excellent direction and production. It really takes you to a whole different world, an innocent, young world, but also a scary one. <br /> <br />This movie can be seen by the whole family because there is no hardcore violence or bad language and the little nudity is not blatant. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves sci-fi, a great story and film as an art. <br /> <br />It is truly a masterpiece, and Peter Ustinov plays one of the most endearing roles ever seen on the silver screen.
