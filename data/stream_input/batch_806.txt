B00127RAJY|5.0|I love it! It is a great workout in 20 minutes that will definately give you results. Its definately tough, sometimes I feel like I want to puke! I do the work out about 5 days a week, but I'm not following the diet. I have definately lost weight, but most of all I feel healthy and strong!
B001AJVR5M|2.0|This offering had the same problem that the previous 2007 release \\"The Jonas Brothers\\" had. It's fun at first, but as each track progresses, it becomes a bit played out.     1. BB Good - Silly but catchy, great hooks, Joe made the Bridge and the last couple of seconds to this song work. Anybody else doing it would sound straight up silly.  8/10    2. Burnin Up - Another great track though I do not think it should have come up after BB Good because you start to notice many similarities between the songs. Their bodyguard's cameo was a great touch, he don't front. 9/10    3. Shelf - Nothing interesting about this track at all. Unmemorable chorus and I find that their vocals get drowned out in the instruments most of the time. 2/10    4. One Man Show - The beginning catches you, the chorus is good but I'm starting to notice these brothers do not possess much vocal skills. An okay filler song. 5/10    5. Lovebug - My favorite track on the album. Sweet and sincere. Would be considered one of the greatest love songs of our time if it weren't for these boys average nasally vocals. 9/10    6. Tonight - Sounds like \\"We Got the Party with Us\\", and overall I felt like I have heard this before. Did not enjoy and often skip it. I started to notice that they not only have a nasally quality to their singing voice, but also a Britney Spears \\"breathy\\" voice. 3/10    7. Can't Have You - Ehhhh. Nothing Special. Hasn't grown on me at all. Obviously a filler track. 2/10    8. Video Girl - Great lyrics, good instrumentation, hook is catchy enough, but Joe has a really annoying voice in this song.    9. Pushin' Me Away - An okay song. But again by this time I'm starting to get bored and want to listen to another album. Nothing new here with this song. 4/10    10. Sorry - Would be a really good song if they would sing the chorus without sounding so.... bad. You can tell they put emotion in to this song but that isn't enough if you have a weird whiny nasally breathy singing voice.    11. GotMe Going Crazy - Are all their songs about the same thing? Okay, but I'm getting tired of these same type of songs. Hook is catchy but not catchy enough. 6/10    12. A Little Bit Longer - I know its about Nick's diabetes, but come on! I don't want to say anything else without sounding insensitive but this is just an okay song at best. 6/10
B000MNP2KI|2.0|The other reviewers here mostly seem to applaud the new, buff, hard-core Bond (shaken not stirred, though he doesn't seem to care). But what's really happened is that 007 has been grafted onto \\"Die Hard.\\" If we really want to revivify James Bond, the challenge isn't finding the right actor -- Roger, Timothy, Pierce, Daniel -- all of them are perfectly fine. The challenge is in the formula. Why make 007 into the typical action movie, where the chase is less a chase than a physical combat?     The James Bond that the early films taught me to love was the suave hero who could vault the perimeter of an embassy and still emerge perfectly dressed for a black-tie evening, complete with the red rose in his lapel. His arrogance had to do with his intellect and his physical charm not his overbearing presence. He doesn't need to be able to leap from a toppling building or construction site; half the film needn't be devoted to the stunt men. The point of James is that he is professional; he makes do with the least amount of effort. Bond: You should never see him sweat.    I think it's in the film \\"Thunderball,\\" 007 enters his hotel room, checks the audiorecording he has made (this is HIGH TECH in 1965), and realizes based on the echo of the steps that an enemy is hiding in his shower. He proceeds into the shower area, knocks the guy out, and leaning over gently pops his gun out of his hand, by hitting just this precise spot on the back of the wrist that causes the gun to drop. No effort even slightly over what is required to achieve the result he desires.  As the intruder runs out of the room he shouts to James, \\"Aren't you going to kill me?\\" James's answer is to this effect: I'm a professional, I kill when I have to; and I don't kill the small fish if I don't need to.     When we are able to re-imagine this sort of hero, who is interesting to the extent that he is complex and not just a burly strong guy, then the makers of the James Bond films will be able to find their new James. In other words, all these choices to replace Sean Connery have been fine; it's the concept that remains lacking.    The new M, in contrast, she is the absolute bomb.
B0016B6ZKG|2.0|I had the priviledge to see Donna Summer perform @ the Hollywood Bowl this Summer for her new album, Crayons.<br /><br />I applaud Ms. Summer to record a new album after 17 years. That is a brave woman to endure the record industry at this uncertain time. You could tell her Records exec's wanted her to be sound more modern with hip hop, Ziggy Marly, etc. She thanked them continously throughout the performace. So Donna, wanting to record a new album or believing she could take on hip hop and a new sound, made Crayons.<br /><br />Yet everytime she introduced a new song during this show, you could see the audience moan and wonder how much more they could endure. We all wondered why is 60 something Donna Summer singing Hip Hop and trying to be like Gwen Stefanni? This new sound she was performing, was beneath Donna, and that stong back beat, heard predominately on most of Donna's songs, was gone.<br /><br />I understand music must progess, but what makes Donna Summer Donna Summer is her amazing sounds she captured during the 70's and 80's.<br /><br />Her set was dazzling, with amazing visual effects accompanied with video screens. But after she sung all her new hip hop songs, she returned to her standards and the audience, which seemed to holding their breath for, exhaled and savored every minute.<br /><br />On a lighter note, Diana Ross performed there a month earlier, and you didn't see Ms. Ross perform hip hop numbers or songs infused with Raggae. And her show was amazing and everyone seemed to have a good time. I think in this record industy, you must know who you are, and don't try to change yourself to reach newer fans.  They will either love you or hate you. Know what your sound is, and continue to create it...<br /><br />Let me just tell you I had a chance to to see Donna Summer 2 years ago in a smaller venue in Pomona, at the Los Angeles County Fair. Her show was amazing. This was 2 years before this new album came out, and you could tell she sorta came out of 'retirement' for this evening's performance. She joked how she just sat on the couch most of the time, and gained a couple extra pounds because of it!<br /><br />Her stage and visual effects were very limited. I remember she came out of a black and white old piano piece that looked like an old set piece from the 1970's that someone forgot to throw away!<br /><br />But her show was pure magic. The sound of her pure classics, one after another and a couple covers was amazing. The audience went wild after every song she did, showing how much they adored her.<br /><br />You could tell Donna was so thankful and appreciated to be back on stage and she said 'It was so good to be so close to Los Angeles, her home (even if Los Angeeles was 25 miles away)' and she started to cry, and paused for a moment, as the audience of mostly females and gay men treated her like the disco diva she is. And there was so much love in the air for Donna. And Donna reciprocated, telling her fans, how much she loved them and how all her songs were about love, finding it, losing it and just love in general. It was so nice to have her so candid, so naked and enjoying the night as one. A remarkable performance!!<br /><br />Donna, just be yourself. You've done it before, and you can do it again!!!ce.

B0018PH3L0|5.0|LD is probably the best western I have ever seen. If you see it once you will never forget it and will want to see it again & again. Robert Duvall is perfect for the part Gus. He is one of my most favorite actors. Tommy Lee Jones is also great. They really get into their parts. Absolutely wonderful movie.
B00005RYLE|4.0|Anyone who watches horror movies knows how creepy a simple cabin in the woods can be. Throw in some dark scenery, evil trees, buried demons and a book made of human flesh called the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis and you know that something gory is about to happen. The five innocent University students who are planned a relaxing retreat in Tennessee have no idea what they are in for as they are about to uncover the deadly dark secrets that have been haunting the area for ages. Even undisturbed the morbid forces make the cabin feel like an unpleasant and disgusting place but once the door to the cellar blasts open on it's own, the students feel intrigued to explore - big mistake!      The overall feeling of the movie is of pure dread from the very beginning. The woods are not lush and green but brown, savage and eerie, something you would not want to see through a window of any cabin. Once our friends settle in strange noises start, which is the beginning of the end. If you like zombie-like ghoulish creatures that must have been dreamt up while in delirious tempest of a fever then this movie will not disappoint, it has all that and more. This movie is not suave and thrilling; it goes through body part chopping, screaming, running, stabbing, throwing up of blood and other questionable fluids of all colors, demonic possessions and false sense of security. It's a crazy movie and its little old, well not that old, but its more old school while these days CG monsters plague the blue screen, in Evil Dead some serious plastic puppets were taking center stage in this film and that made me like the movie a whole lot more. In parts it reminded me of \\"The Thing\\" because these were some really creepy and gross transformations, so fans of that fantastic movie should get a kick out of this.    This is part one of three, and after seeing part two this weekend I bet I know what to expect for the finale, more of the same gooey goodness.    - Kasia S.
B00000ILGB|5.0|Alright, so Amon Duul II was first experienced by me last night.  It was the Yeti album, since that's the album everyone raves about (and by \\"everyone\\" I mean, 12 people living in America!)    The very first song gave me the impression these guys were similar to Can, except even *crazier*, as impossible as THAT is to believe.  Just really heavy and nasty punk rock from the early 70's.  Or so I thought...    Well, the first track (or rather, the first PART of the first track) makes me wonder if Blue Oyster Cult was influenced by these guys.  Those early BOC albums have a similar energy, and the lead singer sounds the same.  BOC didn't come out until 1972, so in the slim chance the two bands knew each other, well, let's just say they probably didn't and it's a coincidence.  It's settled then!    Anyway, is there a female singer with opera vocals in the mix back there somewhere?  I think that's what I hear.  But with the bass constantly shifting around, the heavy riffs that border punk or heavy metal, and the strange nature of the music, you can't really tell what's going on half the time.      One thing's for sure- the final two songs rule a lot.  One of them has pleasant flute jamming, and the other reminds me of a Frank Zappa guitar jam.  Also, \\"Pale Gallery\\" is the SCARIEST SONG OF ALL TIME!\\"  Wanna know why?  That guitar riff that keeps looping over and over, seemingly predicting doom for all human civilization, is just flat out awesome.  One of the coolest songs I've heard in years.      \\"Archangels Thunderbird\\" has really good female vocals... or a guy singing in a really high pitched voice, haha.  I have no idea!  Again, this is part of the charm- not knowing what you're supposed to be focusing on, so you just listen to Yeti and say to yourself \\"There's nothing else out there like it\\" and move on with your daily life.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|After seeing the movie, I just had to have the CD.  I just love it!
B001AIRUOU|4.0|So, if you already own the previous [[ASIN:6305949980 The Nightmare Before Christmas (Special Edition)]] is it worth double dipping for this new version and what is new? The good news is that with the exception of a DTS soundtrack and director Henry Selick's solo commentary track, everything from the previous edition has been included in this one.<br /><br />Disc one includes a new audio commentary by producer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick, and music designer Danny Elfman. They were recorded separately and then edited together. Burton talks about the classic animated holiday TV specials that made a huge impression on him. Elfman claims that this is his favourite collaboration with Burton and talks about how he got involved. There is a significant amount of overlap from the numerous featurettes included on this set.<br /><br />A new extra is \\"What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour,\\" which takes you through a haunted mansion ride based on the film. The attention to detail and decor is fantastic, done in Gothic fashion. You can also take the tour with a trivia subtitle track imparting all kinds of factoids. Also included is a featurette examining how they added the Nightmare Before Christmas style to the classic Haunted Mansion design.<br /><br />Also new is \\"Tim Burton's Original Poem,\\" narrated by none other than veteran genre actor Christopher Lee. This provided the original inspiration for the film. Lee's great voice narrates over evocative concept art.<br /><br />\\"The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" takes us through various stages of the production, including the music, storyboards, art direction, and animation. It provides a detailed look at all of the work that went into creating the film and the challenges of stop motion animation.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with \\"Frankenweenie,\\" a short film Burton directed in 1984. He offers a new introduction and mentions that work has begun on a feature-length stop motion animated film. Shot in gorgeous black and white, it's about a young boy named Vincent (Barret Oliver) who decides to resurrect his dead dog Sparky a la Dr. Frankenstein. Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern play his very Leave It To Beaver-esque parents.<br /><br />\\"Vincent\\" is an animated short film that Burton made early in his career about a young boy who idolizes Vincent Price, who, incidentally, narrates the story. It has a wonderful, Expressionistic look reminiscent of early silent horror films.<br /><br />Also included are three deleted storyboards and four animated sequences introduced by Selick. They feature sequences that didn't make the final cut, some were never animated. Selick explains that they were cut for reasons of time and pacing.<br /><br />\\"The World's of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" explores the characters that inhabit Christmas Town, Halloween Town, and the Real World with all sorts of character designs, animation tests and concept art. It allows you to see the various incarnations of these beloved characters.<br /><br />\\"Storyboards-to-Film Comparison\\" takes a look at a scene from the film and allows you to watch it simultaneously with the corresponding storyboards.<br /><br />Finally, there are \\"Posters and Trailers,\\" a collection of poster art, a teaser trailer and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you own the previous Special Edition, it's not really worth the double dip unless you really a devoted fan of this film. If this is your first time purchasing this film on DVD, then get Collector's Edition which has everything you could possibly want.ite, it's about a young boy named Vincent (Barret Oliver) who decides to resurrect his dead dog Sparky a la Dr. Frankenstein.

B000002VCE|5.0|By far this is one of the top 5 live albums. The Outlaws were simple the best southern rock band. Skynyrd was raw and gritty, the outlaws were precice, had \\"Eagle\\" type harmonies, and the double and triple guitar work is unbelievable. If you like rock, southern rock and a small bit of country balled up into one band, the Outlaws are for you. This live album has all of their great hits from their fantastic 1st 3 albums. The audio recording makes you feel like the you are in the 1st row of the show. The live \\"Green Grass & High Tides\\" blows any version of \\"Freebird \\" away.
0812580346|4.0|That's I felt like I was reading at certain parts of this book.  But putting that aside, it did make for a very interesting novel.  I was a little annoyed when this (French Canadian) writer took pot shots at Americans; making us look like the root of all evil or a bunch of bafoons, but still, I managed to get over that also.  Like any other \\"time travel\\" book, this novel seemed to say that what happened during the \\"flash forward\\" was all do to the knowledge everyone had that resulted from the flashforward which people remembered in the future when it actually took place 21 years earlier .....confused yet?  You won't be once you read this book.  A fine piece of writing setting aside all the quirks I mentioned previously in this review.  The ending was kind of disappointing but still an enjoyable book for any SF fan.

1582701709|1.0|The books reminds me of the Biblical saying \\"even the prince of darkness appears as the angel of light\\".  The author of this silly book proposes that we believe the Cinderella story is true--that wishing and hoping will cause desired items and events to materialize.    I learned this magical thinking was not true when I was a young child.  The baby of a neighbor died and our whole village of 100 in rural Minnesota sank into grief.  Grown men and women wept and I, a young child, believed that if I prayed, the baby would come once again to life.  I knelt on my little knees and I prayed but, of course, even the sincerity of my prayers did not yield the desired result.    Now that I am an adult, I realize that the magical thinking of fairy tales needs to be left behind and that instead of believing in magic we need to believe in principles.  Instead of magical materialization and the \\"law of attraction\\", we need to believe in love for our neighbors, justice, freedom, service and sometimes even sacrifice.      Indeed, the greatest among us have always believed in these great principles and not in the \\"law of attraction\\".  Instead of magic, the greatest among us have always believed in hard work.
B001BGTWXI|3.0|Well for starters, words cannot describe how excited I was for the new Slipknot album. I really thought it would change the metal world, a tour de force of the force that is Slipknot. Boy was I wrong. There's nothing new here, little to appreciate, and alot to dislike. There's already Stone Sour. Slipknot seems destined to become Stone Sour pt. 2.  The album isn't out and out bad. Just incredibly disappointing. I think it is easy to say that \\"Psychosocial\\" may be their most popular song to date, but it also showed alot of potential. Sadly, \\"Psychosocial\\" is the highlight of the album, when it was expected to merely be a starting point for the best Slipknot album yet.  Certainly, not everyone hates AHIG. It's receiving generally favorable reviews in both underground and mainstream media, and people seem to like the new Slipknot. This is the problem. They have now begun to make music for the masses, rather than for themselves or their loyal maggot fanbase.  Now, some of the tracks are rather quite potent. \\"Psychosocial\\" is a great single. \\"Butcher's Hook\\" may be the most coherent track on the album, sounding like good ol' '99 Slipknot. The rest sounds like a retarded love child of Iowa and Vol. 3. It's either too heavy or far too soft. Normally, heavy is better, but when it's thrown in with radio-ready songs like \\"Dead Memories\\" or \\"Sulfur\\" or the horrendous \\"Snuff\\", it begins to paint pictures of a ballerina at Metal Mayhem. Or something along those lines. The point is, too many tracks grab ahold of your attention, only to be floored by nonsensical track placing or a wrong turn instead of a step up.  There is promise for Slipknot yet, however all commendable sections of the album get buried alive by horrible parts. \\"Gehenna\\" is genuinely frightening, and Corey Taylor honestly sounds like a maniacal killer. Songs like thids remind people why they liked Slipknot to begin with. But I counted down the days until this arrived, watched Slipknot at Mayhem, and garnered moreanticipation as each day passed. Sadly, I hardly even care about Slipknot anymore after hearing this. It's proof that they are losing their fire, and maybe they should have broken up after The Subliminal Verses. And after having FOUR YEARS to come back hard, they miss all their targets. A very mediocre outing and incredibly disappointing. I'm trying very hard to recover from how bummed out I am, and I would be shocked if I found a true maggot who honestly enjoyed this album.
B000V86OKG|4.0|Spoiler alert!              The second season pulls away from the planned executions that Dexter carried out in the first season, and now that we've already seen a dozen or so episodes, it's not quite so novel anymore.  However, there is a new antagonist, in the form of a very annoying British woman who calls herself Lila; Dexter meets her while faking a drug addiction in a 12 step program.  Also, we lose a major character and source of conflict, and others end up taking credit and getting promotions because they think he was the killer they had sought (you'll see what I mean when you watch).  Deb continues to be unlucky in love, Angel and Mazuka are...well, Angel and Mazuka, and LaGuerta shows more depth this time around.  Keith Carradine makes a nice appearance as a lead investigator.  Dexter himself discovers more about Harry as well as his mother, and tries to rid the world of yet another demon.  He also goes through some growing pains in his relationship with Rita and the kids.    Often, I find myself rooting for Dexter and hoping he won't get caught.  Is that wrong?  Is he good or evil?  That's the question he leaves us with.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Thank you Mr. Lorre and thank you CBS for picking this show up for a second season! Well written, funny, and for once, a show that has grasp of what it talks about when it introduces a science topic. Only complaint is a tad too much laugh track.
B00000IQW5|4.0|This movie starring, Holly Hunter, Richard Dreyfuss and John Goodman has been one of my all time favorite love stories.  A surprise 'angelic' Audrey Hepburn lends even more class to this movie.  Seeing it on DVD makes it even better.  This bittersweet love story of the power of love before and after death, is done perfectly.  There's even enough action to keep a man interested so it's not your typical 'chick flick'.  A great add for any movie library.

B000J103PC|2.0|From the widespread raves, you'd think this fairly thin coming of age tale was Shakespeare. It's not. It's an adaptation of a book I never read, but the title was slapped onto the movie to help sell it without any true reference to it in the film. Meryl Streep is the one to watch here. Her performance is outstanding. But the rest is rather cliched slapstick. I expected something more sophisticated. Silly me.
031606792X|5.0|This book was highly anticipated by many people and did not disappoint me at all. It was totally unexpected to be this way, but the ending was perfect for me.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|From his days with [[ASIN:B0009XRZ92 Monty Python]] to his visionary epic Brazil, Terry Gilliam has never been an ordinary filmmaker. His unique sense of style and his trademark absurdist humor can be found in all of his films. In 1995, he cemented his reputation as one of the most unconventional directors in America with his brilliant science fiction film, 12 Monkeys. 12 Monkeys is an apocalyptic, romantic, time travel adventure inspired by the French film, [[ASIN:B000OPPADS La Jetée]], which was written by Chris Marker. However, Gilliam's film is entirely his own, a stunning masterpiece of contemporary cinema, and one of the most cleverly bizarre films ever made. The screenplay was written by David and Janet Peoples, who inject the story with an intimate humanistic quality, juxtaposing romance with an eerie atmosphere of impending disaster.    In the year 2035, James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner in a subterranean stronghold where the last survivors of a cataclysmic virus are held up. Their world is monitored by a panel of scientists who use the prisoners for mysterious experiments. Cole is selected to go up onto the Earth's desolate surface and collect life forms for the scientists to study. Upon his return to the underground prison, Cole is told that he's a candidate for an experiment, which if it were successful he would be given a full pardon. He is sent back in time to discover the source of the virus, but he arrives in the wrong year. After getting into a fight with police officers, Cole is sent to a rundown insane asylum where he befriends a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). He also meets a host of mentally dysfunctional patients, including a paranoid schizophrenic named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) who spends most of his time watching cartoons, harassing other patients, and ranting about government conspiracies. Jeffrey helps Cole in an escape attempt, which ends with Cole being caught by the mental hospital's guards and being put into an isolation room, heavily restrained. He mysteriously disappears from the hospital and arrives back in the future. There, the scientists tell him that despite his failure he has been exceptionally useful. They ask him if he would be willing to go back and further investigate the 12 Monkeys... and Jeffrey Goines who may be involved with their formation. However Cole is sent, not only to the wrong time but the wrong place. He lands in Southern France, in the middle of WWI. He's shot in the leg before he vanishes into time.  Meanwhile, Kathryn Railly has been giving lectures on abnormal psychology and the theoretical \\"Cassandra complex\\", which states that some people suffer a mental disorder that makes them believe that they are clairvoyant, and knowledgeable of future catastrophes. After one of her lectures, she's ambushed by a strange man who wants her to drive him to Philadelphia. It's Cole and he's traced the origin of the virus to Jeffrey Goines and his billionaire virologist father. Kathryn convinces Cole that he's delusional, but then Cole's story is proven to be true when she discovers that the bullet she removed from his leg dates back to the first quarter of the 20th century. Now she must uncover the truth and help Cole to stop the spread of the virus, but nothing is what it appears to be.    The entire cast is superb. Bruce Willis delivers one of his most nuanced performances as Cole, creating a strong yet vulnerable man who must overcome his own fears of madness in order to save humanity. Madeleine Stowe gives a fascinating performance of a sane woman, who must call into question all of her long held beliefs, and face the insanity of the world around her. But the most memorable character is Jeffrey Goines, who is brought to by Brad Pitt in one of his most remarkable performances ever. He succeeds in making Goines sympathetic, funny, and completely manic. Not only does show off his underutilized versatility as an actor, Brad Pitt also gives us, the audience, access to the off kilter world in which the entire film unfolds. As for Gilliam's direction, 12 Monkeys proves that he's capable of making films that are not only humorous, but stark and profound as well. Ironically, the film's greatest flaw is also its greatest strength. As an audience, we are never explicitly told how the story ends. Sure, there are implications within the film, but there are so many different interpretations that one single idea feels constricting and limiting. Terry Gilliam's brilliance is that he doesn't dictate his story to the viewers; rather he allows them to discover its subtleties and secrets on their own, and then draw their own conclusions. It makes the film even more interesting to watch with a group of friends and everyone's perception of the ending is contrary. It's this idea of open interpretation that makes 12 Monkeys so timeless.

0739441655|4.0|There's a place in John Grisham's heart where he yearns to tell about his South in the way that William Faulkner did. Grisham is no Faulkner, but his Ford County is an entertaining place to revisit for a nine-year story (last seen in A Time to Kill) that provides a picture of rural Mississippi at the end of the Vietnam War. Unlike Grisham's other books with legal-sounding titles, this book isn't primarily about the law and lawyers. Instead, a murder and its consequences stand as bookends to hold this story about changing Mississippi together.<br /><br />The book is filled with more stereotypes than original characters, but the exceptions make the story rise above the average. The two vivid characters who make the book work are \\"Willie\\" Traynor, the young college drop out, who buys the Ford County Times out of bankruptcy and turns it into a vital part of the community. Traynor stands in for us as non-rural Mississippians in understanding what's going on. The most interesting character is \\"Miss\\" Callie Ruffin, mother to a family of professors, who was one of the first African-Americans to register to vote in Ford County.<br /><br />In the background is a continual sense of dread as the local residents live in fear of the lawless Padgitt family which \\"owns\\" the sheriff and the county when the book opens.<br /><br />This book is considerably more delightful if you listen to the unabridged recording read by Michael Beck who is able to turn simple narratives into Southern charm.

6304698542|2.0|Cabaret, the on-stage musical, is one of the most enthralling and moving musicals to be ever found on Broadway.  It's message and theme are both important and beautiful.  The only problem is that when they attempted to adapt it to the screen, the took a beautiful show, and ripped it apart.  The plot, characters, and a few songs (Mein Herr, Money) are completely distorted and absolutely different than the original show.  This movie should have had a different title other than \\"Cabaret\\" because this is not the same as the magnificent show.  I gave it two stars only because the movie itself is not all terrible.  This movie and the show should be viewed as two completely different entities, they truly have nothing in common.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|The Best Batman EVER!!!  Forget The Dark Knight and Batman Begins... well don't forget those, they were pretty good too.<br /><br />But come on, Tim Burton in top form, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito in the best role he ever had and the best performance he has given!!!  Sure you hardly see Michael Keaton but when he's on he's on.  I wish he would return to this role or to Beetlejuice for that matter.<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theater 5 times, with different people, totally in love with Catwoman.  The only thing I wish they had kept was the batmobile from the first Batman (1989)  This one was too shinny and seemed a bit weak.  To me the Batmobile in 1989 was the best and sexiest ever.<br /><br />If they re-do movies, why not continue the vision of this one.  They should have Tim Burton create a sequel to this one with Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Keaton and continue the story line of Catwoman etc...  I enjoy the less violent versions of Batman, family friendly.<br /><br />The Dark Knight was too violent.  Anyway Rent it Buy it See it Wear it out and Buy it again.<br /><br />\\"A plan is forming eee,eee,eee!!!  I want in, the thought of Batman makes me feel all dirty, maybe I'll give myself a bath right here\\"  Great movie!
B0017MO10U|5.0|Back To The Old Orifice Again    Rick Anderson, aka MacGyver, playing his alter ego, Jack O'Neill, in his breakout Sci-Fi show \\"Stargate, SG1\\" has previously referred to the Stargate as the \\"Old Orifice\\" with great nostalgia.  Even though the \\"gate\\" never attained the same reverence as the \\"U.S.S. Enterprise\\" did in the original Star Trek Sci-Fi show, it is without a doubt the single most important artifact of the popular show.   In the \\"Stargate\\" world, the limits of the gate led to more conventional forms of transportation during story development. The SG1 teams were later able to choose to travel via spaceships or even be scrambled and beamed ala Star Trek. However, it is \\"the old orifice\\" that takes center stage in this romp back through time.    Many of the unique features of the gate are presented which lead to problems that even the Ancient builders never seemed to bother fixing. For instance, why is every gate traveller subjected to being dumped on the other side of the wormhole without so much as a cheap shield that would protected them from a hostile greeting party?  As this scenario plays out, we discover that getting there really is the only fun part. Stargate's slickest bad guy, Bal'l, is back in form as the universe's biggest pain in the gate. While the entire team doesn't operate together in the beginning of the story every one is brought together near the end...for the \\"do over\\" of a lifetime.   This is the best \\"after series\\" movie to date and captures the spirit of the early \\"gate\\" adventures.   If only B'all had brought along a personal shield the entire world would have turned out...well, you buy the movie and find out for yourself.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|It seems counterintuitive to label a movie about a pig girl as beautiful, but that is exactly what it is.  The world that you are invited to enter in Penelope is visually stunning, whimsical, and decadent.  I found myself aching to be able to walk through this magical city, even though the only thing magical is Penelope herself.  Despite the premise, the story line is believable and real.  Every frame and line of this film shows the immense care and craftsmanship that was taken, from the writing to the acting.  It is both storytelling and moviemaking at its best.  While at first glance, the lesson or moral of this fable may seem trite, it is illustrated in a new and imaginative way, and is still a lesson that so many of us have yet to mastered for ourselves.  From the first viewing, Penelope worked its way into my top ten movies.  It is one that I will watch again and again, both when I am cozily happy on a rainy day and when I am sad and need to see the brighter, more hopeful side of life.  Perfectly crafted, perfectly acted, perfect.
B0019X3YXM|5.0|This movie was excellent, very charming and entertaining with great acting and directing.      Elisha Cuthbert is PHENOMENAL in this!!!!  If you are already a fan of hers then this should be a definite dvd purchase for you.  This role is perfect for her and she plays it brilliantly.  She's hilarious and very likeable in this and her antics are incredibly amusing.  Easily, one of my favorite movie characters ever.    The guy in this was very good and had chemistry with Cuthbert which was important to this movie working.    Writing and directing, top notch.  This movie never had a dull moment.  I was constantly engaged and entertained, and there were a ton of laughs, mostly provided by Elisha Cuthbert.  This movie had an awesome visual style, very pleasing to look at, with some particularly impressive shots throughout.      This is the kind of movie that I will be able to watch over and over again, so a dvd purchase is a must in my case.  I really hope this movie catches on and more people give it a shot, because it's definitely one of my favorite films.

031606792X|3.0|I loved the first three books too and have mixed feelings about this final title in the saga.    I think the plot is still a good one and needed to stay up late to finish it.    But..    the charm and potency of the series for me and for many I'm sure is the mix of the human and the fantasaical. There is romance, pain, dramatic tension,adventure - all the stuff of human life is there. As soon as the human/werewolf/vampire tensions in the plot begin to be resolved by various plot devices - it all moves too far away from the bitter sweet appeal of the plot so far.     I think what Stephanie has done is very brave and creative on the one hand but on the other the human appeal/poignancy does shrink as a result. Too many loose ends are tied up in what, for me at least, is an unappealing way.    I really feel too for Charlie and Renee with the neat assumptions that they will deal with their newly transformed daughter.    I like many hoped that Bella's humanity would be valued and redeemed as such.  The miracle baby, Jacob's imprinting, her happy transition into vampirehood ... 'feel' too convenient by half and not that inspiring either.     That said, how to finish this story - was always going to be a challenge for the author and this was one valid way to take it.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|I have owned an original Criterion copy of this for years but this new transfer puts it to shame. They have remastered it to where it looks like it was just filmed yesterday! The colors are brighter and much more vivid. The audio has also been improved. Criterion has also included an English dubbed track, so if you are like me and don't know the Italian language, you can actually watch the movie and listen to it in English rather than having to sit through two hours of Italian jibber-jabber. There is also a disc two that is just chock full of bonus features, including an interview with the late director. Hats off to Criterion....AGAIN!  P.S. - I just bought the blu-ray edition of this movie and I have to say that the BFI blu-ray is better. The picture is much sharper and the colors more vivid. Don't get me wrong - this copy is nice, but i've compared them both and the BFI version is sharper and more detailed.
B0013HA838|5.0|I have a half dozen dvds of this operatic masterpiece, and this one is, hands down, my favorite. McVicar's production is flawless, and the singers all give fully committed performances here. Not only do they act superbly, but they can all sing! Le nozze di Figaro is a funny and at the same time deeply moving and even disturbing opera, and you will experience all of that here. Without question this dvd is one of my very, very favorites in my entire collection, which probably consists of over 200 operas on dvd. I only wish I could give this more than five stars!
B000Y7ZHCU|1.0|First of all, I am (well, was) a big big Celine Dion Fan.  The reason why I am giving this DVD a low rating is that fact (not an assumption, fact) that Celine Dion is lipsynching a significant part of her show (also on her current \\"Taking chances\\"-tour).  Lipsynched are:    - The power of love (after the first verse which is live)  - Its all coming back to me now  - The power of love  - I drove all night  - River deep mountain high  - My heart will go on    The whole issue starts to come out, a belgium newspaper had that \\"scandal\\" in their news lately, they also let some experts listen to the tapes, and they said that it is impossible for any singer to sing a song with the exact same timing (broken down to the second), exact same high notes every time, over and over again.   This is being discussed heavily on a lot of internet forums, people show \\"proof-videos\\" where they put so-called \\"live\\"-perfomances from Celine next to each other.    Though Las Vegas is considered as a big success for Celine - at least financially - I don´t think it was a good step for her artistical direction.   Singing the same songs over and over again, five times a week, in the same old arrangements, partly even playback, didn´t do Celines artistical appearance any favour.  And this direction is being continued during her current tour.    I give this DVD one star as people pay a fortune to hear Celine LIVE, not old prerecorded tracks.  If you are ready for Celine - PARTLY Live in Vegas, go and buy the DVD.
0671004107|4.0|Any author can write a story about science in the not-so-distant future, but Carl Sagan is the genius who portrays today's science and scientist in a realistic light.  These are people worried about obtaining grants, and dealing with aging parents, trying to advance up the glacial-paced science hierarchy.  The portrayal of science reminded me of Kim Stanley Robinson's Antarctica while the interpersonal relationships reminded me more of real life.<br /><br />Reading the book could be either an interesting perspective or a bit of daily drudgery continued.  Of course what keeps it moving is the story, which lays out like a mystery: find a clue and it only opens more questions.  Sagan builds this right to the end and then cleverly continues it out.  It is a fitting model of science -answers only leading to more questions, curiousity opening up whole new worlds- that is refreshing in contrast to some of the other aspects portrayed in the book.<br /><br />An excellent read.
0792842499|5.0|WOW! I've always loved this flick & this Special Edition made me appreciate it all the more. Sergio Leone took all of our American, safe, comforting & familiar Western conventions, blew them all to hell & then thrust a jarring, jagged, grotesque epic in our faces. Even the landscape itself is alien-looking to us: sun-blasted & disturbingly weird, as though its from another world. The sets are all weathered, battered & awful-looking. Most of the people are striking in the strangeness of their appearance. Characters are unshaven, filthy, wear dirty clothes & look like they smell terrible. That's all just part of the foundation of this film, the characterizations are the biggest shock. Clint's Blondie is The Good (!!!???). What the hell? He could only possibly be considered as even remotely good in comparison to the other two & even then his \\"goodness\\" is strictly a matter of degree. Towards the end, he briefly comforts two dying soldiers & those are the only acts of human kindness in the whole movie. Also, he pets a small kitten instead of making a meal out of it or something. And when he double-crosses his associate he only steals all the money from their partnership and then abandons him in the middle of the desert instead of shooting him. So goodness is strictly relative in this flick. But its hard to imagine a story where a character like Tuco is comic relief. Also, Angel Eyes is truly an all-time great villain. Clint, Eli Wallach & Lee Van Cleef are uniformly fantastic in their parts. Imagine a Brooklyn Jew making the best cinematic bandito ever!    Now for the script - almost every scene is the height of absurdity & impossible events & unbelievable coincidences are strictly routine. There's an extremely fine-tuned, bizarre, subtle sense of humor at work here & the viewer gets a constant feeling of disbelief & unreality throughout the entire film. Leone perfectly balances the sublime with the ridiculous every step of the way & creates a unique moviegoing experience. The vast themes of war & all its tragedies are mixed in with some utter craziness as he goes along.    The extras are very enjoyable. First is the added footage. It felt like a new experience to me & I've seen this flick I don't know how many times. Kudos to Eastwood & Wallach for dubbing their parts so these extra scenes could be added. I was unaware that both Lee Van Cleef & Sergio Leone had died in 1989. It'd be interesting to have their participation & hear their observations. The interviews are quite good as well. Most telling to me was Clint's observation that Leone was so extravagant & meandering while he, Clint, was more economical & direct & that this was the major difference between the two of them.     How could I forget the music? This soundtrack is just fantastic - one of the all-time greats, if not the very best ever. It fits and complements the action perfectly.    I was careful not to include any spoilers for those lucky people who haven't seen GBU yet. To see it for the first time is a wonderful experience. I can't recommend it highly enough - even those who are sure that they'll despise it just may be pleasantly surprised. Like I said, all the machismo is offset by a truly wild, intelligent & unusual sense of humor. Buy this Special Edition - its well worth it!

0062515675|4.0|Its amazing that all of these books say the same thing the Bible says but people would rather trust a human for advice than their maker. I give this book 4 stars because it does follow the Bible. It may sound off the wall to some but that would depend on their desperation.
031606792X|4.0|I was worried when I picked this one up, after all, hearing all the conflicting opinions and reviews of this book is really what brought me to read Twilight to begin with and I had invested a lot of time and energy into characters and story.  I have to say, I was not disappointed.  All the complaining people did about this story is unnecessary.  Perhaps I'm like Stephanie Meyer, I like a happy ending.  I have no problem with everyone getting everything they asked for tied up in a nice little bow.  It felt so good!<br /><br />It is true, that this book has a different feeling to it but I think there is a good reason for that.  In the first part, told by Bella as a human you still feel the Edward/Bella vampire/human relationship that we're comfortable with.  When it changes to Jacob's point of view, well, it's Jacob's point of view.  Something we haven't seen except in an epilogue or two.  BTW, for as much as I dislike Jacob and try to skip over his section when I re-read this, he does show one of my favorite scenes.  When he first sees Bella in her obviously pregnant state he describes Edward and how distraught he is and in obvious pain (this is before the icky impregnate my wife so we can get rid of this creature that's killing her scene) but I think through Edward's pain we really see how deeply he loves her.  It hits me in the gut every time I read about him moaning in anguish over what is happening to Bella. Morbid maybe, but effective since we don't really ever get to see this from his point of view.<br /><br />Once Bella becomes a vampire in the third part it is a different book which is why it had a different feel to it.  She's finally on equal footing with Edward.  He no longer is the protector and by the end that's a roll Bella fills for everyone.  We lose a lot of that vulnerability in their relationship because of this which is really what makes the series work so well.  As Stephanie Meyers says, their relationship was always defined by him being a vampire.  Now that she's a vampire, it doesn't necessarily lose it's interest but we've reached the conclusion of our story.  We don't have to go on.  I loved getting that little glimpse into her experience as a new vampire but I don't think we really need to go beyond that.  They're vampires now, the rest would just be jumping from hobby to hobby to pass eternity.<br /><br />Like I said, I like things wrapped up in a nice bow and I love a happy ending.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Well, this first album is of course an all-time classic, as it should be.  As has been said before, the Van Halen brothers are the real deal.  True classical musicians who also know how to rock!  \\"Bill and Ted\\"s Beethoven would be proud!  Both of them are classical pianists, which is ironic, since Eddie's known as a guitarist, and Alex as a drummer.  Yet I've read where Ed actually claims to be primarily a pianist, not so much a guitarist!    Yet this is not their best album.  It's more of a warm-up for what's to come.  Musically, that title may belong to either 5150 or OU812.  Or the two together could be considered their high-point musically, even vocally.    The editorial reviewer above claims that after 1984 they went into their lean years.  We are entitled to state our opinions, but of course nobody's entitled to have everyone agree with them.  My opinion is that Van Halen really took off after they dumped David Lee Roth!  After DLR they were able to spread their wings musically, and they acquired a real vocalist, one who stands with the greats of rock singers, in Sammy Hagar.  To my ears, nothing before 5150 compares musically to the \\"Van Hagar\\" era.  I seem to be in the minority there, but take a listen to \\"5150\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Mine All Mine\\", \\"Pleasure Dome\\", and \\"Human's Being\\".  Van Halen's natural melodic genius is very much in evidence here, which is probably why they've been (erroneously) called pop-rock (by the stubborn or melodically-challenged).  If they are indeed pop-rock then it's a slam to much of the rest of rock, particularly heavy metal (which label is erroneously applied to Eddie as a heavy metal guitarist), since it says that these genres are lacking in melody.  In some cases, particularly modern metal, that's very true.  There's not much today that I've heard in the way of real music, real melodic music.    But Van Halen is nothing if not melodic and musical.  Ed is a musician, a guitar player, a melody maker; not a \\"heavy-metal\\" guitarist.  I've never seen him that way, though I know many do, and that he has influence many many heavy metal guitarists.  He plays it his way, and if people like it, so be it.  If they don't, no worries because many others like myself will hear the music in his playing, and they will appreciate it as being music, not just rhythmic noise.  This last part is really what separates Van Halen from much of the heavy metal genre.  Sure, Alex expertly drives a mean drum kit, emphasis on \\"expertly\\" and \\"mean\\".  Sure, Mike drives a mean and relentless bass guitar.  Sure, Sammy screams out those vocal cords with the best of them.  And sure Ed slings an axe like no one else, faster and louder than most.  But it's their technique and musicality, their melodic sense and timing, that makes them stand out; and it's their skill, in particular Ed's ability to sling out the melody fast and smooth, with unique subtle \\"personality\\" touches throughout, which makes them great, rather than just good or noteworthy.      And those qualities shine most in the post-DLR era.  They're only just beginning with this first knock-out punch to the face of music!
B00000273P|5.0|A stunningly ambitious album, Prefab Sprout's four part \\"Jordan: The Comeback\\" is an old fashioned double album with a concept per \\"side.\\" The first looks at love and the wildness of youth, the second explores American mythology of the 50's via Elvis, Jessie James and the cold war, the third, love as an adult getting married, and lastly, an examination of God and the Devil. Sterling production from Thomas Dolby complimented Paddy McAloon's folkish lyrics, and all together, this was as flawless an album as the classics [[ASIN:B00005ATHO xtc's Skylarking]] or [[ASIN:B000005RS5 Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden]].<br /><br />In addition to the flawless flow of the songs, there is an array of classic songs to be found. The waltz-time heartbreaker \\"We Let The Stars Go\\" should have been a hit. \\"Carnival 2000\\" looked optimistically at the coming turn of the century with a Brazilian Beat and the Irish Prayer<br /><br />\\"We ask for any wrong we've done<br />the years ahead forgive us.<br />We ask for any good we've done<br />that all of it outlive us.\\"<br /><br />Then comes the chapter of Elvis and Jessie, as Elvis watches his own funeral and complains about Albert Grossman's hack biography. Jessie James is a \\"dance upon the run,\\" bemoaning that he's not portrayed as a culturally adept individual. Looking for class in his departure, he wonders \\"Don't goodbyes deserve some Bach, not Barbershop?\\" Meanwhile, Elvis plots his final comeback as the side closes with \\"Moondog.\\"<br /><br />But the best, and most ambitious, part of \\"Jordan\\" happens as God and The Devil square off in the fourth part. God wishes that his songs came to him as simple pleasures (\\"One of The Broken\\") as The Devil petitions to come back home (\\"Michael\\"). We're finally left with Paddy contemplating the afterlife, praying that he and his loved ones will meet again. After all, he sings, \\"If there ain't a Heaven that holds you tonight, then they never sang DooWop in Harlem.\\"<br /><br />\\"Jordan: The Comeback\\" is just as good as [[ASIN:B000BCE7QU Steve McQueen]] (recently reissued in a deluxe version) and was easily one of 1990's best albums. It was also one of Thomas Dolby's finest hours as a producer, matching his love for Joni Mitchell sensitivity to McAloon's complex lyricism.

B0017I1FO4|3.0|First off, I think Brent has probably the best voice for rock ever, and I absolutely loved the first two albums. Unfortunately half of the tracks on this album are TERRIBLE. Not just poor or otherwise unexciting, but flat out ridiculously horrid.     1) \\"Devour\\" has idiotic lyrics to go with it's pop-like sound. This song makes me want to swing my arms back and forth and do the \\"Happy Days\\" dance, and this dance isn't out of pleasure but mocking the song and the brain dead lyrics. It makes me want to point and laugh at wanna-be renegades. This song says \\"Look at me, I'm such a rebel!\\" ACK!  2) \\"Sound of Madness\\" - Mediocre song.   3) \\"Second Chance\\" - Pretty decent. I can kind of get into it, even though again the lyrics are kind of dumb, but who cares this is ROCK right?  4) \\"Cry For Help\\" - Would have been better without the counting (Personal pet peve: I hate when artists count in songs)  5) \\"The Crow And The Butterfly\\" - Great feel-good song. Could do with less repetition of words, as with many of the other songs. Lots of repetition. It's like hey, let's just repeat ourselves again. Repetitively.  6) \\"If You Only Knew\\" - good song.  7) \\"Sin With a Grin\\" - Finally some good lyrics to go with good rock.  8) \\"What A Shame\\" - BRILLIANT. This is an amazing song. Easily the reason enough to buy the album.  9) \\"Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide\\" - Another very good song coming from a completely different direction. I love that they've mixed it up a bit.  10) \\"Breaking Inside\\" - ehh, good lyrics but the song never quite gets to a point that I would call \\"good\\"  11) \\"Call Me\\" - A pretty EPIC ballad. Not the hard core rock that I would love to hear from Shinedown but a very good song none the less.    I had read from the band 6 months ago or so that they were going to be more hard rock on this album, which I was eagerly awaiting. I would say this album was a supreme let down. There are a few redeeming songs however. I would reccomend to only by the few songs that are good or buy the CD if you get a good deal (under $11)
1401207529|4.0|This comic was pretty good. It focuses on Batmans methods as he first becomes a crime fighter also introduces catwoman(this time she is black and she is a dominatrix hooker hmmmm) The art is maybe and acquired taste. A good read especially if you are truly a comic book fan
031606792X|1.0|The book was a disappointment to me for different reasons than the majority here.  I can get passed the 'plot holes' and the 'bad messages'.  But I just can't get passed the lack of action!  This book was so anti-climatic that it's painful.

B000F8O35U|2.0|I ordered this DVD from Netflix and we played it twice.  All in family concluded that they didn't want to watch it again.  This is from a 2 1/2 year old girl, a 4 1/2 year boy and a 10 year old girl.  My girls love many of the songs we play from YouTube, like \\"Part of Your World\\", but the evil enchantress and the sharks that \\"kill\\" make it all too scary for them.  My kids have 100's of DVDs, and preferred titles are: Angelina Ballerina, Ratatouille, Cars, Baby Enstein box set, Teletubbies, Rescue Hero, Alphabet Train, Dora the Explorer, Bob the Builder, Maisy, Kipper, Mickey Mouse (not all the old ones though), Winnie the Pooh Friendship series DVDs, Heffalump Movie, and Wiggles Big Red Car to name the favorites.  Wish there was an option to select and play \\"preschool\\" edition minus all the scary parts.  Even our 10 year old thought too scary, and said Cinderella was the only one that doesn't scare her of all the Disney movies.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this whole set when it came on the market several years ago (individually)  My husband and I LOVE it. We've watched the entire thing from start to finish several times.  My dear husband (and myself) thinks they are all a great group of women and loves the chemistry and wit of them all combined. Some of his friends don't like it but he suspects they feel threatened by these women despite them just being characters - fortunately, my husband is a LOT more secure then that! After we get the kiddos to bed for the night we sit down with a glass of wine and watch a few episodes.  I can't say enough good things about the cast and writing.  It was a ground breaking show for female characters and we've enjoyed every minute of it!

B001BGTWXI|1.0|Ok, I have been a huge Slipknot fan since I have been introduced to the band, but the direction that they went with this one really caught me off guard. Overall this album is mediocre, however my biggest problem with it is the addition to Joey's mask, I really think that mocking and disrespecting Jesus Christ like this just to sell albums is pretty pathetic and the purchase of this album was the last support that I am giving them.
0345479092|1.0|Unfortunately the author never mentions that her practices and tips aren't reasonable for newborns.  I would suggest to any parent that if you are going to use the methods outlined in this book that you wait until your baby is at least four months old when they are developed enough to have a scheduled routine and when their sleep habits are more predictable.  Until that time, forcing a routine as she suggests, interrupts sleep and is not practical.      Overall, I think there are better books out there such as \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby\\" that cover a lot of the same parenting practices (soothing a baby, etc.) but the material includes different strategies for different ages which is much easier to follow.

1881273156|5.0|my best friend recommended this book when i was still engaged, in my 20s. I am so glad I read it... my relationship with my boyfriend transformed so much! we both read it and started recommending it to all our friends, even parents and relatives. they all still thank us today!  I am not going to sum up its content, as you may already know about it, but I just want to express my deepest enthusiasm and thankfulness to the author of this book, who - perhaps without knowing it - has helped (+ still does) thousands of families.   It is a must, whether you are still single (you need to know more about love, to be prepared when it comes,right?) or just going out with him/her,  or have been married for years. Believe me, I have read quite a few books on the subject and this is The BEST.  I had a chance to read it again last week, 10 years after the first time, and I am still dazzled how insightful it is, how many things I had already forgotten, and how it can still improve the quality of my (happy) marriage!  It is never too late, when your marriage is in deep trouble, give it a try, even if you think you are OK, give it to a friend as a present and you will be amazed how it can change your/their life. All you've got to do is open your heart and be willing to listen. All the rest (and sometimes it is a Miracle indeed) will come on its own.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|With this set you get both movies, the main movie is the re-worked edition with all the silly additions, like the cartoon Jaba talking to Han; and the bonus disk is the old 1977 edition without all that crap. The \\"Special\\" Edition looks great and sounds great. The old \\"Un-Special\\" Edition looks and sounds horrible, its widescreen, but it looks like someone copied it from a vhs version. I was quite sad when I shove this in my DVD to watch just to get a really bad (I mean REALLY bad) copy of my favorite movie. So if you already have the \\"Special Edition\\" and want the original 1977 version, I can't say its worth spending money on this.  EDIT DEC 2010 - This is a great movie nevertheless, even the re-done version is worth a watch. But the quality of the original unedited version of the movie is really bad and in my opinion not worth buying yet another version of this movie. One can only hope that one day they release a remastered version of the originals without the cgi edits.

0394826817|5.0|well, as the title of the book suggests, this is a book about good manners, being polite and what not.   My 2 year old girl likes it already, although I think it would be even better for older children, they could follow more easily the stories with their favourite characters from Richard Scarry (great drawings!!!).   There are 7 short stories, each of them dealing with a particular topic: how to behave at parties, or with your parents asking for help, or in the street, or with neighbors. all of them are nice and funny. Both boys and girls will enjoy them, also thanks to the brilliant pictures!

0452289963|1.0|I picked up this book to see what Oprah was so excited about, skimmed through to get the gist, started to read more closely, and got so disgusted I couldn't finish it.  What was so frustrating was that he identified some real problems, but was way off base with his solutions.  His spirituality seemed to be mainly a blend of Christianity and Buddhism.  He rails against some Christians for thinking they have the Truth, but seems to believe that what he is writing is Truth.  Most frustrating of all was that he often wrenched scripture passages out of context and twisted their meaning.  Unless the reader already has a good grasp on the Bible, he may think that Tolle is advocating spiritual message that is consistent with Christianity and end up very confused.  My advice is to just skip this book--there are so many better ways to spend your time.

0596522347|5.0|I just destroyed this book with folded pages and ink annotations, so the perfectionists out there may want to order two copies, one for eating and one for sharing.  The price is phenomenally reasonable, especially for something that is all color and totally elegant.<br /><br />This is not about powerpoint slides.  If anything, it is a very subtle but explicit critique of how retarded they still are (e.g. no separation between bullet groups).  This is an utterly inspiring combination of wisdom, education, visual excitement, and plain fun that \\"lives\\" what it preaches.<br /><br />When I get back to the office I am going to read this book again while I create a briefing on the Earth Intelligence Network and educating the poor one cell call at a time that respects the deep knowledge being imparted by this author and her team.

For the advanced audiences, 20 slides, 20 seconds each, 6 minutes and 20 seconds total.<br /><br />I read and reread sections, and the recurring thought in my head was that this book may well be all one needs to run a semester long course on the communication of important complex ideas.  The author does not just show a correct slide, the author breaks down every aspect (e.g. fonts, color, grid layouts, use of images, creating your own art) into separate chapters with very ably-illustrated palettes covering all the options.  I have a note on this, \\"nuances are unpackaged and illustrated.\\"<br /><br />I note the author's admonition that change across the presentation is a distraction, that animation should support the message and the continuity of understanding.<br /><br />For large organizations, the author covers templates as a means of harnessing the diversity of knowledge of varied functions and employees, while maintaining a consistency of brand.  BRAND is huge within this book, and in this book BRAND is not a legal term, it is a philosophical term.  I am hugely impressed by a chart showing UK companies that treat BRAND as a design imperative being so much more competitive and profitable than those that do not.  This book is not just asserttions and demonstrations, it is fact and case based and eminently authoritative.<br /><br />I learn for the first time that powerpoint slides can be instantly made to be black and white to focus audience on the speaker, or made all white, by pressing B or W.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|This 74'er jem - along with a few other movies - has influenced a whole generation of slasher flicks. Way ahead of it's time, one can clearly point out that the makers of films like When a stranger calls (78'), Halloween (78'), Friday the 13th (80') and all the Sleepaway Camp trash that followed with another few thousand mediocre to bad productions.     Director Bob Clarke has co-started a genre, however did so marvellously without much violence or any gore. Instead he relied on a solid script, some witty film edits, obscene phone calls that will make your skin crawl, a somber, abstract soundtrack and a few pretty watchable actor performances. With Margot Kidder as a delightful chronically drunk foulmouth, 2001 Space Odissey veteran Keir Dullea as a modern classical musician and John Saxon in his usual detective role...minus his usual cheesy factor, I'm sure fans of the genre will be enjoying this treat. Needless to say that some of the imagery I shall not forget all that quickly.    I say: Two thumbs and the hair on the back of my neck UP!
B00180R06I|3.0|Danish film maker Carl Dryer (1889-1968) is considered among Europe's finest directors, the creator of innovative 1928 THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC and the legendary VAMPYR--but some cinematic legends are best left recalled instead of revisited, and such is the case with the latter film.  Produced in 1930, released in 1932, and very loosely based on the novella CARMILLA by Sheridan LeFanu, VAMPYR does indeed have moments of great poety, but on the whole the film is akin to watching paint dry.<br /><br />The plot of VAMPYR is trivial, the tale of a young man who stumbles into a mysterious estate where one of two sisters is under vampiric attack.  The appeal of the film is actually in Dyer's truly remarkable cinematic ideas, ideas that are often described as surrealistic in execution.  Shadows move independently of those who cast them--or exist without any source at all.  Fog and mist drift strangely through the landscapes.  A skull moves of its own accord.  And most spectacularly, the young man experiences an out-of-body vision in which he foresees that he himself will fall prey to the vampire unless he can destroy it.<br /><br />These moments are memorable indeed and there is no doubt the film is visually stunning.  Unfortunately, it is also very, very, very slow.  In theory, this slowness exists to intensify the poetry of the images and a crawling sense of horror; in actual fact, however, I found it simply slow, and that the extremely languid pace undercut both poetry and horror to a very significant degree.  Fans of the film--and it has many--will no doubt curse me as a Philistine and declare VAMPYR is too fine to be appreciated by the likes of me.<br /><br />As in most instances, the Criterion Collection edition offers a group of interesting bonuses.  It is worth noting, however, that the film itself is not in pristine condition (it never has been); even so, this is easily the best print in circulation.  Recommended for hardcore cinephiles, but most others should give it a miss.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerT, Amazon Reviewer

817224164X|2.0|I assigned myself this book to read because I am working on a degree in history, with the aim of teaching high school history. Now that I have finished, I'll never inflict this reading on my students. This is easily the most tedious, boring book I have ever read. I think that is partly why Hitler was able to get away with basically spelling out his plans years before he came to power, and people were still surprised when he did exactly what he said he would do. Also no one took him seriously, and were horrified when they found he actually believed all this drivel he wrote.<br />Still, it is a very important book historically, because it announced his plans 15 years before he carried them out. World leaders who wondered what Hitler was about had only to pick up Mein Kampf. As I read this book, I noted the most glaring cases of anti-Jewish remarks, as well as Hitler's views on the rest of the world. Often, the two subjects are intertwined. The quotes you read below are just some of the worst examples; this book is packed with countless other lies against the Jews and other nations.<br /><br />GERMANY VS THE WORLD:<br />P.134, \\"Unused soil exists for people with force to take it.\\"<br />P.138, \\"Don't let political boundaries obscure the boundaries of eternal justice.\\" (Borders of other nations)<br />P.139, \\"What (land) is refused by amicable methods, it is up to the fist to take.\\"<br />P.255, \\"No half-measures; gravest/most ruthless decisions to be made.\\"<br />P.398, \\"Victory lies eternally and exclusively in attack.\\"<br />P.455, \\"Terror is only broken by equal terror.\\"<br />P.610, \\"The aim of a German foreign policy of today must be the preparation for the reconquest of freedom for tomorrow.\\"<br />P.611, \\"For the oppressed territories are led back to the bosom of a common reich, not by flaming protests, but by a mighty sword.\\"<br />P.651, \\"The boundaries of 1914 mean nothing at all for the German future.\\"<br />P.651, \\"Only childish & naive minds think to correct Versailles by wheedling and begging.\\"<br />P.652, \\"We National Socialists must hold unflinchingly to our aim in foreign policy, namely, to secure for the German people the land & soil to which they are entitled on this Earth.\\"<br />P.654, \\"Germany will either be a world power or there will be no Germany.\\"<br />P.654, \\"If we speak of soil in Europe today, we have in mind only Russia and her border states.\\"<br />P.660, \\"Let no one argue that in concluding an alliance with Russia we need not immediately think of war; an alliance whose aim does not embrace a plan for war is senseless and useless.\\"<br />P.688, (conclusion) \\"A state which in this age of racial poisoning dedicates itself to the care of its best racial elements must someday become Lord of the Earth.\\"<br /><br />HITLER'S VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE:<br />P.107, \\"Broad masses can only be moved by power of speech.\\"<br />P.341, Calls voters \\"Bourgeois voting cattle.\\"<br />P.375, Refers to \\"Unshakable stupidity of the voting citizenry.\\"<br />P.465, \\"The NSDAP should not be the servant of the masses, but their master.\\"<br />P.577, \\"National Socialism must lay claim to the right to force its principles on the whole German nation.\\"<br />P.608, Calls people \\"Great stupid sheep's herd of patient lamb-like people.\\"<br />P.654, Refers to African nations as \\"Little ni***r nations.\\"<br />P.659, Openly says he appraises value of men on racial basis.<br /><br />ANTI-JEWISH REMARKS<br />P.169, Refers to Jews as \\"Poisoners of people.\\"<br />P.206, \\"There is no making pacts with the Jews.\\"<br />P.232, Refers to Jews as \\"Great masters of the lie.\\"<br />P.244, Says Jews control the press.<br />P.246, \\"A 30cm shell hisses louder than a thousand Jewish newspaper vipers, so let them hiss.\\"<br />P.255, \\"Clear away filth of civilization, ignoring screams.\\"<br />P.272, \\"Jews in the press promoted lies about Germany in WWI.\\"<br />P.308, \\"Once this book (Mein Kampf) is common property of the people, the Jewish menace may be considered broken.\\"<br />P.324, \\"The personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Jew.\\"<br />P.351, \\"The Jew is the great master in lying, and lies & deceit are his weapons in struggle.\\"<br />P.453, \\"The first task is the elimination of the existing Jewish state.\\"<br />P.556, Accuses Jews of manipulating Northern & Southern Germans against each other in WWI.<br />P.561, First uses the term \\"Jewish question.\\"<br />P.638, Refers to \\"Jewish plot to rule the world.\\"<br />P.651, \\"It is the inexorable Jew who struggles for domination over nations; no nation can remove this hand from its throat except by the sword, and such a process is and remains a bloody one.\\"<br />P.661,\\"(The Jew) goes his way, sneaking in among the nations from within; he fights with lies and slander, intensifying the struggle to the point of bloodily exterminating his hated foes.\\"<br />P.662, Says Jews are from Satan.<br />P.679, \\"If at the beginning of the war (WWI) or during the war 12,000 or 15,000 of these Hebrew corruptors of the people had been held under poison gas, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.\\"<br /><br />By now it should be crystal clear how evil this man was, and this book is. This book was dictated while Hitler was in prison in 1924, and published soon after. It would be nearly a decade before he gained power. You have to wonder why his opponents and other world leaders who read this book at the time did not take it more seriously, especially in the late 1930's leading up to war. It's all laid out here; his determination to dominate Europe, to ally with Russia and then betray her, his contempt for the common citizen, his lust to tear up the Versailles treaty, and his unending hatred of the Jews. He openly hints at his desire to destroy the Jewish people many times. These views are mixed in with endless, incomprehensible rambling that will put you to sleep faster than Nyquil. Still, we only have to read it; Hitler was notorious for putting his own generals to sleep with his hours-long tirades.<br />In any case, at the end of the book I was left with a feeling of disbelief that the rest of the world had not seen it coming, with this material available for anyone to read.

P.679, \\"If at the beginning of the war (WWI) or during the war 12,000 or 15,000 of these Hebrew corruptors of the people had been held under poison gas, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.\\"     By now it should be crystal clear how evil this man was, and this book is. This book was dictated while Hitler was in prison in 1924, and published soon after. It would be nearly a decade before he gained power. You have to wonder why his opponents and other world leaders who read this book at the time did not take it more seriously, especially in the late 1930's leading up to war. It's all laid out here; his determination to dominate Europe, to ally with Russia and then betray her, his contempt for the common citizen, his lust to tear up the Versailles treaty, and his unending hatred of the Jews. He openly hints at his desire to destroy the Jewish people many times. These views are mixed in with endless, incomprehensible rambling that will put you to sleep faster than Nyquil. Still, we only have to read it; Hitler was notorious for putting his own generals to sleep with his hours-long tirades.   In any case, at the end of the book I was left with a feeling of disbelief that the rest of the world had not seen it coming, with this material available for anyone to read. I know that hindsight is 20/20, but hopefully the next time we are confronted with this kind of insanity, we'll be a little more quick to recognize it.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|Shinedown's first album since 2005's Us And Them marks a major change in creativity for this band from Jacksonville, Florida. Combining the somewhat softer sound of that album with the slightly harder-edged style of 2003's Leave A Whisper, which spawned hits such as \\"45,\\" \\"Fly From The Inside,\\" and \\"Burning Bright\\" and amping up the \\"rawk\\" factor tenfold, The Sound of Madness truly is the best of all worlds. The band's lineup has changed quite a bit since their last release: Original bassist Brad Stewart has been replaced by Eric Bass (interesting name for a bass player, yeah?) and founding guitarist Jasin Todd has been replaced by two guys, Zach Myers (a touring guitar player for the band between 2005 and 2007) and Nick Perri. Lead vocalist Brent Smith and drummer Barry Kerch are the only two original members that remain, but that fact does nothing to negate the quality of music on this album.    From the moment you hear the opening verse of \\"Devour,\\" you can tell that this is a different band from three years ago. A lot of hubbub has been made about Shinedown going \\"political\\" with this song, but it is the only track on the album that smacks of anything anti-Bush. The lyrics are simple yet effective, and perfectly complement what has to be the band's most rocking single to date. The title-track comes next and while it isn't as fast-paced as \\"Devour\\" it's still a great song with a message for those who enjoy wallowing in self-pity. \\"Second Chance\\" is one of those ballads that only Shinedown can craft, and it's a damned good one at that. The pre-chorus is particularly touching. \\"Cry For Help\\" is another upbeat rocker in the vein of the first single. As some other reviewers have mentioned the \\"1, 2, 3!\\" lines are a tad annoying but they don't detract from the song's overall quality. \\"The Crow and The Butterfly\\" is one of the most beautiful songs Shinedown have ever written, and quite possibly one of the most beautiful songs written period. Musically and lyrically itjust flows so well and puts the listener in a light-hearted state of mind. \\"If You Only Knew\\" is a bit similar in sound to the previous track though I prefer Brent's vocals (which are among the most powerful in any genre today, in my opinion) on this one to that one.    Things take a slight turn for the worse with \\"Sin With A Grin.\\" Maybe it's just me, but I really can't find anything I like about this song. It is definitely one of the weaker tunes on the album, not unlike \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" from Leave A Whisper and \\"Begin Again\\" from Us And Them. Just very, very average. The album picks back up with \\"What A Shame,\\" however. This is one of those songs where Brent is really in his element, telling a profound story about the human condition and doing it with unrivaled vocal passion. \\"Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide\\" sounds rather different from anything else the band has done in the past, but I don't particularly care for it. The chorus is decent but lyrically the whole song just sounds too tailored for the Hot Topic audience, as it were. \\"Breaking Inside\\" is slightly reminiscent of some of their Leave A Whisper-era work and that is certainly a good thing in this case. Brent's lyrical delivery in the verses is great and the chorus is as powerful as any in the group's catalog. The album closes with \\"Call Me,\\" a spine-chilling piano ballad that ranks right up there with \\"45\\" and \\"Shed Some Light\\" from Us And Them, only I believe it's better.    As my review's title indicates, I think this is the album that Shinedown has been waiting to hit us with, and the wait was more than worth it. Even with missteps such as tracks seven and nine that could have easily been replaced by much better songs, this is a great release that all fans of the band can find something on to enjoy.
B000UNYK76|4.0|It was like I was standing in the crowd in Italy. Great made DVD and the band is better than ever.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|The zombie thing has been done to death (no pun intended) with the big action hero in attendance. Ths movies shows how 2 normally screwed up, everyday people would react to it. I think this is one of the best zombie comedies ever made.
B000GFRDN6|5.0|As I comb through my LP collection and burn CDs that then get dumped into my iPod, I run across gems that I have not played for some time.  This album is one such title.  For the most part my LPs are in great condition but some that I inherited from friends or purchased used, are a bit too beaten up to be transferred to CD.<br /><br />My personal standard for buying CDs is to avoid buying any that I have in good condition on LP.  If the LP is damaged or the recording is new, I will go for the CD.  The other exception to the \\"rule\\" is for offerings that contain substantial or in some other way \\"must have\\" content not present on the LP.<br /><br />This 30th Anniversary edition qualifies on all fronts.  My LP was too noisy and this version has a DVD with interviews and a concert, not to mention guest appearances by Joe Satriani and George Thoroughgood...<br /><br />It's always interesting to hear the story of success as told by the artist themselves.  This DVD offers the opportunity to visit in a casual art studio with Steve Miller as he shares some of the stories behind his music.  We see a relaxed character in a nice shop surrounded by painting materials.  He picks up various guitars that are laying about and whips off riffs and tells his stories.  It's a nice balance of intimacy and context.<br /><br />The album itself benefits from a few bonus tracks that are \\"nice to have\\".  It was good to hear this music again after such a long time.  I also managed to get this one at a price that made it a terrific value.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This is an old fashion love story for the decade and the main characters are not even human but machines. This is a fun-filled movie the entire family will enjoy sitting down and watch.You have all the elements lonely guy[come on folks] who meets a gal and falls in love. We all saw the movie and know what it's about and here we have two characters who share the same quality feelings for one another as we humans do and have fun watching Wall-E try and hold Eva's hand [for a lack of a better word] throughout the movie as seen on his favorite video tape.  The one thing I couldn't figure out or didn't understand is that here we have Earth with a massove garbage problem and didn't know what to do with but could make spaceships to take all of mankind into space. What...they didn't know how to make recycleing plants like we have today.So they go into space to pollute it but thats another subject.  If there's a video you need in your collection it's this one, romance, comedy and laughter throughout the movie.  I've seen the movie over a dozen times and it never gets old just more loveable.
0061537934|5.0|I shy away from books or videos in which dogs or other animals can suddenly talk or act like humans. They are generally too \\"cutesy\\" and unrealistic. I don't remember what drew me to this book but I am thankful. Garth Stein has such an insight to a dog's mind that one must wonder if he, too began the life chain as a dog some life-times ago. I laughed and cried throughout the book and I have recommended it to many others.  If you start reading, you won't put it down, you won't regret it, and you'll never look at your own dog the same way again.

0312427573|4.0|Tom Wolfe captures the essence of big-city racial and class conflict, plus greed, ambition, and self-serving hypocrites. His story concerns high-living banker Sherman McCoy, whose accidental exit from the New York freeway into the crime-plagued South Bronx leads to his mistress running over a young black man (who may have been looking to rob McCoy).  Enter a questionable black leader, an unscrupulous vote-seeking district attorney, and a sleazy tabloid reporter, each of whom seeks to manipulate and play off events for their own aggrandizement.  The story has few admirable characters at any level, not in the Park Avenue mansions, the courts, nor the tough streets.  Equally lacking are social codes of decency and honesty.  The story covers New York in the mid-1980's but one senses it applies today as well.        Wolfe provides a powerful tale, one with some parallels to the Tawana Brawley hoax that occurred not long after this book arrived.  The book drags a bit in a couple places (thus four stars and not five), but Wolfe provides a powerful message.

0756404746|5.0|This is the fantasy that we've been waiting for.  Rothfuss has created an amazing world populated by interesting cultures and deep characters.  Rothfuss's writing abilities are incredibly strong, and I don't believe it would be hyperbole to suggest that he is at/near the level of Ursula Le Guin. Frankly, I like his prose better than any other fantasy author I've ever read (but that might be a bit of hyperbole, wouldn't it?).  Like Le Guin, Rothfuss is not trying to sound high-brow, but instead uses his amazing language skills to craft clear, deliberate, and interesting sentences, telling the story of a complex hero/anti-hero.  If you've read Terry Brooks or Raymond Feist and thought that an interesting story was let down by weak writing or undeveloped characters, this is the book for you.  The story elements evade tired fantasy conventions, yet have a foundation that is intimately recognizable for readers who enjoy compelling fantasy worlds and characters.  This book will get you excited about fantasy again.
B0014127BO|3.0|What can I say...I've always rooted for Bryan Adams. A part of me always felt he had it in him to move beyond the popmeister leanings of his early hits and become one of the great storytellers of his time, ala Mellencamp, Petty, Seger and, dare I say it, Springsteen. Later albums like INTO THE FIRE, WAKING UP THE NEIGHBOURS and 18 TIL I DIE confirmed this, proving both adventureous and creative. However, I think the days of striving for greatness are behind Adams now. Instead of being compared to Petty or Mellencamp, he now almost assuredly will be lumped with B-listers like Corey Hart, Rick Springfield and Walter Egan (all of whom, I admit, I love!). Why? Because he just doesn't seem to care anymore. Yes, he still tours quite a bit, but his blossoming career as a photographer seems much more important to him...making records just seems to be an afterthought. Starting with 2005's ROOM SERVICE and continuing with this year's 11, he has just phoned in his performances, seemingly putting out new records just because he \\"has to\\" or \\"it's time.\\" Most of the material is weak and uninspired, the production amateurish at best (No doubt a major part of the reason no American label was willing to pick up and distribute this latest release). Things get off to a particularly weak start, with roughly the entire first half of the album being way below par. First up is \\"Tonight We Have The Stars\\", one of those power pop numbers Adams was so famous for in the early to mid-80's. Love the opening lines of \\"We'll save ourselves a bottle/Of California red/We'll drink it on a Tuesday/Let it go straight to our heads\\", but it's all downhill from there. The same can be said for \\"I Thought I'd Seen Everything\\"....this is nothing new. We have the mid-tempo arrangement, the urgent (but by the numbers) lead vocal and lyrics from Songwriting 101 (\\"I love your kiss me mouth ~ and your static touch\\"). Sorry, but this is NOT the work of a man nearing 50, who's been in the business 30 years! Things don't get any better with \\"I Ain't Losin' The Fight.\\" Now, I don't need everything to be \\"deep\\"...heck, I LOVED the 80's!...but I DO need a song to A) have some substance, B) be clever or C) be fun. These tracks are none of the above. These are just routine numbers, cranked out in order to fill up a CD. And that's sad. Things finally come alive with \\"Oxygen\\", a glorious blend of acoustic guitar and garage band sass. Pounding drums and blistering electric guitar provide a power and energy that has been missing thus far. Add a lead vocal that's honest, sincere and from the heart (and gut), and you have one of 11's best cuts. \\"We Found What We Were Looking For\\" has some admittedly sappy moments to it, but overall this really is a lovely song. \\"Commitment\\" is a big word, and it often doesn't get it's just dues. That all changes here with the simple lines \\"Didn't fall to pieces/Never lost our reason/Never stopped believin/Ah, never stopped ~ believin.\\" Once again, from the heart...and the gut! Things take another bad tumble with \\"Broken Wings\\", one of the most pre-fabricated songs I've heard in years. Take a uninspired arrangement, add an over-the-top lead vocal, then toss in lyrics like \\"You give me love/When love is all I need\\" and \\"When I was blind/You came and opened up my eyes\\", and you have a song anyone, but particularly someone with Adams' experience, should be ashamed of. \\"Somethin' To Believe In\\" is a mixed bag....the verses have a nice, easy-going quality to them, while the choruses are bloated and heavy-handed. It really is true....sometimes less IS more. If Adams had just stuck with the strings and acoustic guitar...! Up next is the disc's true masterpiece, the haunting \\"Mysterious Ways.\\" From the atmospheric strings to Maire Breatnach's stunning fiddle, everything comes together in perfect harmony. Add some lovely lyrics (\\"They say the heart is shaped just like a fist/Holding in it's feelings/I say the heart is like an open hand/Holding out and healing\\") and you have a real gem. Ditto \\"She's Got A Way.\\" Mark my word, if this song had been on CUTS LIKE A KNIFE or RECKLESS, it would have been a HUGE hit, played at weddings for decades to come...it's THAT infectious! Once again, simple, sincere, naked and REAL....11 could have used so much more of this! I LOVE this song! \\"Romantic\\" with a capital \\"R!\\" \\"Flower Grown Wild\\" puts an interesting spin on the whole groupie thing...before any of them got on that bus to Hollywood, they were someone's daughter, with a \\"childhood name.\\" Adams' rough, edgy lead vocal conveys the desperation of a tale that often ends with nothing more than going \\"home to nothin but a loaded gun.\\" Powerful stuff. The album ends on a strong note, with more than a hint of what \\"could have been.\\" \\"Walk On By\\" is a muted tale about following your dreams. Adams' hushed lead vocals, sweeping strings and delicate acoustic guitar and Breatnach's powerful viola all coalesce into a thing of shimmering beauty. This track deserves not only to be heard, but to be a hit as well. It's a shame that can't be said about most of the cuts off of 11. Here's hoping that, when it comes time for his next release, Bryan Adams will rededicate himself to his craft. I'd hate to think he \\"could've been a contender.\\" (As with all my reviews, I am giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).nd you have a real gem. Ditto \\"She's Got A Way.\\" Mark my word, if this song had been on CUTS LIKE A KNIFE or RECKLESS, it would have been a HUGE hit, played at weddings for decades to come...it's THAT infectious!

B00008GKEG|5.0|I purchased this documentary on VHS when it first came out (for about $100! ) so that should tell you how I feel about it! If you are a big fan (big- not \\"moderate\\" or \\"casual\\") you'll eat this up. Besides the early never before heard recordings, photos, performances, and interviews, the stories told by the Beatles and their close associates are just fascinating. And what's great (and pretty funny also) is that they don't always have the same opinions or recollections on events surrounding the band. For example, it seems apparent that George Harrison disliked Beatlemania but Ringo sounds like he really enjoyed it. Also, it's great to learn that despite the eventual acrimony they were very close to one another, something else that makes this worth watching. The last few chapters kind of bum me out because of the dissension and eventual breakup, but you'll get an insight as to why it happened and I think come to realize it was their only option. The added disc has special features about the making of the documentary and accompanying videos that will also be devoured by \\"big\\" fans. If you're near my age, 50, it will bring back great memories of a great time and answer all the questions you ever had about the Beatles, The most enjoyment a Beatle fan can have for $49.95. Highly recommended.
B000000OUE|5.0|I just listened to this in my car for the first time in a while and I was reminded of what a perfect record this is. The word that always comes to mind to describe AC2K is \\"shattering\\". Bludgeoning guitar work, slamming drum work and RZ's voice and lyrics - often deliberately incomprehensible and somehow better for it. The recorded introductions and the dark voodoo atmosphere of the songs make it almost a concept album. All the tracks are great, but I have to call out my favorite: Blood, Milk and Sky. I have no idea what its about, but the searing guitar work, bottle-rattling percussion and eerie wordless choruses never get tired.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|Bob Marley and I go way back, to the early 80s to be exact. I owned \\"Bus\\" first as a double album, then replaced them with a CD as one era was ending and another began. NOW, my first CD wore out and I had to - once again - find a replacement. You know what? it just keeps getting better and better. Call it maturity, call it leaps in technology, I love this collection of live songs, no matter the format.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this for a wedding I was standing up in. I had already been eating good and walking 2 miles a day. I just wanted to tone up and lose just a few pounds. I had 30 days till the wedding and I did this 5-6 times a wk. I read the reviews about it kicking your butt.. BOY IS THAT TRUE. I did have some choice words for Ms.Michaels during the video and after. But I stayed with it. If you have any specail accasion and you have 30 days and you want to look good BUY THIS!!! I didnt think it was realy working but my pants got losser, my shirts were not clinging to my tummy as it had before. I still sometimes dont think it is working but then I look in the mirror and see the differance. I started feeling really good when I went to go pick something up and someone said \\"WOW LOOK AT YORU ARMS!!\\" It is so great. Like I said I was already eating good. I keep my calories between 1245-1500 a day. Eat a lot of fruits and veggie, I was doing that 3 months before I bought the DVD. That w/ the cardio of walking helped some come off but not a lot fast. The only thing that I would advise anyoen that is thinking about buying this two things... One I do have Patellofemoral Pain syndrome on my right knee and cannot to a lot of the lunges fully and some of the cardio cuz its just to hard on the knee, you can still to the lower impact steps just be careful. You know yoru body and dont hurt yourself to do it fully, no shame in doing the less impact!! I would also mention that you should do some leg stretchs before the workout, with the jump rope, running in place, and plank jacks it works out your calves. STRETCH THEM OUT THEY DO NOT IN THE WARM UP. TAKE 2 MINUTES WHILE THE DVD IS STARTING AND STRETCH THEM OUT..!! You will be thankful you did. Over all great DVD my freinds and family want to get a hold of it but I wont let it go!!But I did buy one for them.. =-)
B000PGQJXG|5.0|I just wanted to clarify for future buyers- This is just the 180g pressing of What's Going On in a deluxe gatefold sleeve. The vinyl IS NOT tan or colored wax like advertised, it's just plain ol' black. It also DOES NOT contain any bonus tracks. Not that I really cared about those two things, but someone else might. That shouldn't stop you from buying this beautiful album if you don't own it already.
0930289528|5.0|If you encountered the movie first and are merely following up on the book, keep one thing in mind. This is how the story was originally intended.     Initially, when I read that Alan Moore was not happy about how the movie turned out, I was puzzled. However, after going back and reading this original Graphic Novel, I now understand why. The movie (while providing for it's intended effect) leaves a multitude of things out.    The story is much more complicated and the characters are provided much more depth herein. In fact, anarchy aside, I would say that this graphic novel is a completely different story. It's a must grab.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|I've been a fan of the band since the beginning, and this is arguably their best album even if it's not my favorite. It's disappointing to see people who call themselves fans still can't appreciate it when every single song on the album isn't a driving horror film set to music; part of the appeal of Slipknot is that they aren't- and never have been- just another one-dimensional screaming thrash band.     Their strength is in the emotional contrast during their songs, and All Hope Is Gone hits on those strengths perfectly in my opinion... they're one of the only bands still releasing quality music that puts out an entire album that you want to listen to sequentially rather than just pulling a track here and there and ditching the chaff. Lyrically their songs are as powerful without the pounding drums and power chords, and it complements the album by making it listenable without wearing you down by the end.    They've taken a bit of a new direction, and it's fresh and a good listen. There's plenty on the album for people looking for old school Slipknot (Gematria and Psychosocial for sure) and some new stuff like Gehenna and Dead Memories that will bring about and ease in new fans that may have been intimidated or turned off by the smashmouth metal  earlier on the album.       The special edition of the disc is worth the extra money, despite a lackluster Vermilion pt.2 remix. 'Til We Die is the haunting closer that's been a staple of all of Slipknot's albums, I wouldn't pass it up.

B001CNMDUO|4.0|If like most tradtional action movies, this would be good one to get. I do not care for many action films, anymore but this one is pretty good. worth the 16 dollars or so. But if wait couple of months, bet you can get for 10 dollars in no time.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I've been a Alan Parsons fan since stationed in England in the late Seventies. As always, Alan Parsons shows he's a true visionary when it comes to pushing the envelope with his differences in the music he puts out. \\"A Valid Path\\" shows he's still got it. It's an album unlike any other he's produced and it's a joy to listen to. Lot's of electronica that keeps you busy thinking where he's going next. I recommend this to any true hard core Alan Parsons fan.
B001BR5F4C|1.0|Do not purchase this! If you are buying this, I assume it is to be part of a Blu-Ray collection, considering the fact that these movies were released years ago. Save your money for the real thing, when Tarantino releases the whole film, uncut, with the special features. Patience is a virtue and revenge is a dish best served cold....
0385720920|4.0|Something really cool happens in this book: you're not too sure where it's going, but it's someplace funny and ridiculous and you're almost there when....<br /><br />But I won't give that away.  You have to find out that out for yourself.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Chuck Palahniuk and I really enjoyed it.  The choppy style really suits the absurd story and tangling thought processes of the bizarre characters.  If I had any problems with it, it would be that if Palahniuk could find something really disgusting and revolting to describe in any scene...he did.  Whether it's bodily secretions or questionable hygiene or something else smelly or crusty, he made sure to point it out during the story.<br /><br />If you can get past that--and very graphic descriptions of sex acts and elderly neglect--you'll have some really good laughs.
031606792X|1.0|I am one of the people who was sorely disappointed with Breaking Dawn largely for three reasons.    The first is that it felt like all the rules established in the previous books were discarded with little or no explanation.  There's suddenly no issues whatsoever between werewolves and vampires.  They team up once against a common enemy and they're cool.  The wolves even ignore their purpose on the planet--to protect humans from vampires--for fear that it might ruffle a few feathers.  Of the vampires.  Who are killing people.  Even though it was never explicitly stated that vampires do not produce semen, it was heavily implied by the fact that they don't produce blood, sweat, tears, or urine, and we were never given an explanation as to why vampire venom burns and hardens every part of the body but the testes.  I read an interview in which Meyer chose the questions that would be asked of her and chose that question and didn't answer it; she said to just go buy the guide in December, which makes me feel like I'm being manipulated.  Also, the implication was that imprinting was for producing stronger wolves, but in this book, she tosses around a bunch of pseudo-science that would make Renesmee infertile, so she wouldn't be producing anything.  And suddenly at the end, for absolutely no plot-furthering reason, the werewolves aren't really werewolves at all.    Second--and I think this is where a lot of the happy ending protests are coming from--it's hard to feel like Bella deserves a happy ending.  She certainly hasn't earned one.  She goes through a bunch of mental stress that is largely of her own creation, gets threatened, gets saved, lather, rinse, repeat.  She doesn't even have a hard time being a vampire.  She's magically awesome at it.  She doesn't have a power that she has to be in any way imaginative to use for things to go her way.  The only person who dies is the one who put her and her family in danger in the first place.  She marries a guy who will stay hot and rich forever.  She has a magical baby that's born pretty and potty-trained, doesn't cry, and is nearly invincible.  And--joy of all joys because this is the most important--she finally gets to be pretty!  She never has to grow as a person nor as a character.  She never changes what she wants from the beginning, never has to, and gets it all anyway.  And there's the fact that Jacob never wanted to imprint because he valued freedom too much, but we're calling that a \\"happy\\" ending because he has someone to spend his life with.  It gives the feeling that the integrity of the characters was sacrificed to allow for a pretty picture at the end.    Third, the choice that was so important in the previous two books, what I would call their most redeeming quality, is rendered meaningless.  Bella's choice of life or love, while it was never really much of a debate, was pretty big symbolically.  It was supposed to be epic that she's making this huge decision because she loves Edward so much, and this book is basically saying, \\"Well, gosh, it's a really good thing she didn't go with Jacob because then we couldn't have this super happy ending for everyone, and she didn't really have to give up her life at all anyway.\\"  Gee, all that worrying for nothing.  And it raises the question of whether Jacob and Bella ever cared for each other at all or if it was just his connection to that particular egg.    And those are just the big ones.  Never mind Bella's human friends that she never really cared about anyway, Jacob's new pack that he took responsibility for but never really wanted, Bella's mother after whom she named her child.  Why should we or the main characters be interested in seeing them ever again?  Throw in the borderline offensive descriptions of the foreign vampires (All the Africans look alike?  Really?), and parts of it just kind of rub me the wrong way.    But then, those are my issues with the story.  The main problem I found with the book is that it doesn't havethe feeling of a conclusion.  It makes no effort to tie up loose ends and feels like a story was deliberately extended to allow for a series of machinations to make it end a certain way.  As though we can have nothing but smiles in the final snapshot.
031606792X|4.0|I have to say this book was really good. Finally a happy ending. I share Stephenie's beliefs and I am so glad that the story was written the way it was. I hope that it means she will be continuing the story, maybe not Bella and Edward's story but Jacob's story. Thank you so much Stephenie Meyer for a good, clean novel!

B000002KXV|5.0|After 25 years I get the album better now than I did as a Steely Dan fan in college. It's really the voice of a 40-something remembering his adolescence and young adulthood in the 50s and 60s.     Fagan's lyrics and vocals are funny, ironic but also really heart-on-the-sleeve wistful in ways I never heard when I was a kid. The music holds up, too -- better than I would have expected, and arguably better than late Dan (certainly better than the whiny \\"Gaucho\\").     The sound is kind of a surrealistic time capsule -- some of the finest musicians on the planet (Jeff Porcaro, Valerie Simpson, Larry Carlton, the Brecker Bros. etc.) playing ultra-slick 1982 arrangements to lyrics gently poking fun at the 50s beat generation. The saxophone solo on \\"Maxine\\" (Michael Brecker I think) by itself is worth the price of admission.
B00009XITQ|4.0|Colin Firth makes any movie worth watching as far as I'm concerned, but thanks to the super cute Amanda Bynes and just a hint of angst this movie appealed to my kids as well. No, there's nothing really heavy or deep here, but there's enough conflict to keep it interesting and make the movie a great escape for the entire family...and a refreshingly clean one at that.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I was very skeptical about any series made from the Terminator films as I am a big fan.  This was a huge and happy surprise for me.  There were a few episodes I wasn't so impressed with--but \\"What He Beheld\\" toward the end of Season 1 quite literally brought me to tears in one place, took my breath away with its ending.  This is television at its finest, and after all the reality show garbage--truly refreshing to see some actual quality entertainment again.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I grew up with the Beatles, listening to \\"Something\\" when I was 9 years old, but over the years I forgot about the Beatles. Then came \\"Love,\\" a remarkable remix that I saw performed and I was stunned. It was like falling in love with the Beatles for the first time. This mix will appeal to loyal fans and newcomers. Lush, crisp, and bright, this salient remix is a classic.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I was looking for a workout video that would give me results and one I could do at home without having to buy a lot of equipment to start. I came across this one while browsing the selections and what caught my eye was the \\"lose 20lbs in 30 days\\" claim.   I had never seen the Biggest Loser program or heard of Jillian Michaels but I did some research and found she was highly praised in the workout world. I have been doing the video now for 3 weeks and have just now moved onto the 2nd level. The workouts are very tough but cohesive so they move along quickly and are very easy to follow. The only equipment you need are some hand weights, 3 & 5 lbs and a mat if you are on a tile floor.   I definitely feel a higher level of endurance and my body feels stronger.  Now for the warning part. The only complaint or disappointment I have is the weight loss issue. I have not lost any weight & so far my measurements have not altered either. I found out after the video purchase that the weight loss claim is linked to a customized \\"diet plan\\" based on how much you want to lose AFTER joining JM's Official Site. The joining fee is around $120 a yr (if I calculated it right) and if you can afford this fee then I am sure it will work out great for you. I cannot so I've resorted to  a \\"common sense\\" diet of my own design and hope to see some weight loss results soon.  Overall this video is a great home \\"workout\\" whether done alone or with other exercise. If you stay with it and do it every day as suggested you will feel a difference as I have even if you don't see one.
B000E1MTZE|4.0|For all the hype, expectation, and letdown they are three very fun science-fiction kung-fu movies that don't dissapoint now that we have had the time to stand back and digest them for what they are.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|Overall, I liked The Butterfly Effect, but it feels poorly executed. Until the movie started really getting interesting, it felt cliche, had a knack for getting under my skin, and was laughable at the same time. I never really connected with it, like 12 Monkeys. It twisted and turned all over the place too, yet becomes the exact opposite, very predictable, once it starts getting better. There is just something missing in the beginning... I don't really know what it is, but even though the movie gets much better later on, it can't make up for it. On the positive side though, the plot line and ideas were really good. I love alternate realities, time travel, and memory, and the story connects them all without being too out there or unrealistic. It reminded me of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, same with it's special effects as well. Ashton Kutcher, and many of the actors, weren't bad either, but nobody really blew me away. I'm not sure if I would recommend the movie. If you want a trip, then yes, see it. Or if you're into dark movies, I would recommend it too. It's really depressing, and of an existential manor. That is both a good and bad quality. Just seeing how everything gets rearranged with disastrous results can make anyone question their lives and \\"What if?\\". The Director's Cut ending follows suit too, but it wipes the floor with the original theatrical ending. Whether you like it or not, it fits perfectly with the overall theme of the movie.
0143036556|3.0|Jared Diamond has a gift for explaining complex phenomena to the average person in a way that is captivating and digestible.  In this book, he tackles a topic (the collapse of societies) that is depressing to some and terrifying to others (I suppose it is infuriating to those who just want to be free to build a mine with no environmental protection). He manages to keep the reader's attention for over five hundred pages and leave us with hope for the future -- if we can learn the lessons of the past.  He is well read and there is a lot of research behind the book.  These are the chief positives.  I read the book and was quite taken by it.<br /><br />The negatives take a bit more time to appreciate.  Although Diamond creates a fairly consistent picture that supports his five point framework, it seems that there are other versions of some of the stories (e.g., the fate of the Greenland Norse) that may not fit it so well.  Also, if you abstract the five point framework you get something like this: there are five factors that lead to societal collapse (self inflicted environmental damage, climate change, the presence of hostile neighbors, the absence of trading partners and finally the efficacy of societies response to the previously mentioned four factors), not all apply in all cases and of course there are other factors (not featured) that sometimes apply. At that point one is tempted to ask, why is five a magic number?  I believe the answer is because those are the factors that Diamond wants to talk about -- or because those are the five that the average person wants to hear about. They fit my agenda so I initially accepted them at face value.  It was not until I was challenged to think of other factors that lead to societal collapse that the five point framework started to collapse for me (e.g., didn't Jared Diamond write a Pulitzer Prize winning book called \\" Guns, GERMS and Steel\\" that talks about the devastating effects that pestilence had on the indigenous cultures of the New World?) .  If the five point framework has value, it is as a literary device, not a scientific theory.  If taken seriously, it is the kind of framework that finds its way into orthodoxy and creates barriers for further investigation.  To me this is a fairly big minus.<br /><br />Some may say I analyze too much: I should just read and enjoy.  But isn't that, after all, the point of scientific inquiry?  Isn't that supposed to be the basis for such a book?e New World?) .  If the five point framework has value, it is as a literary device, not a scientific theory.

0440242576|3.0|I am one of those few readers in the known universe that is not overly fond of John Grisham's legal thrillers.  I do like the way the man writes though, and thoroughly love his novel, A Painted House.  This work sort of falls into the category of \\"this is not a book I would seek out, but hey, I need something light to read.\\"<br /><br />The basic premise of this story is a wear couple, a successful couple, which has just shed their only child to a stint working for the Peace Corps in some South American Country.  Christmas is coming on, with all the usually frantic spending, party going, visiting, dinners and (I can relate to this) the pain of decorating.  In short, Luther Crank decides to skip Christmas all together, and talks his wife into taking a cruise instead; not party, not cards, not gift giving, no donations and no decorating.  Of course you know the old saying; \\"the best laid plans of mice and men....\\"  Thereby hangs the tale.<br /><br />This is a rather light read and should be read as the author intended, sort of tongue in cheek.  It is a fast read, one that you do not have to think about all that much and is amusing, although I must say, shows quite a lot of insight in to our psychic and our forced interaction with community and family.  Much of the silliness that surrounds Christmas, many of the little quirks of this holiday are rather exaggerated by the author; but this is simply good story telling.  I will do feel though, that by overly exaggerating the situation, the author makes some pretty good points and certainly will give you some food for thought.  The overall story moves along at a very nice pace.  Some of the interaction with neighbors and business associates can be pretty funny, and I must say, pretty typical.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun little read but if you choose not to take in all that seriously, then it becomes even more fun.  I like it when an author strays from his or her normal genre, even though it seems that many fans almost seem betrayed.  Give Grisham a break...at least he makes the effort to write something other than his normal fare.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkse Grisham a break...at least he makes the effort to write something other than his normal fare.

B000R7GKQE|2.0|I am trying so hard to like this show.  The actors are good, but the writing is predictable with silly dialogue.  The concept is a good one; I just wish there were more momentum and better lines for these poor actors to deliver.
B00008EY65|4.0|It is a well made movie with a good and hellish storyline. But it is too dark to be family viewable, discretion is advised.  If you like the gene, devils and monsters, it is a great movie.

0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind is one of the best new fantasy novels I've read in years, its as good as anything GRRM has written, and hopefully published in a more timely manner.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was my favorite of all the Twilight books!! I loved the different twists and the way everything came together in the end!! I was so surprised by what happened at the start of the book! I had no idea that it would turn into the main problem! I have been a Jacob lover from the stat and I really liked how part of the book was from his point of view! This is worth having for sure, but only of you have read all the others that come before it! ENJOY!!
031606792X|5.0|With all of the mixed reviews this book was getting I was starting to get a little worried, but after FINALLY finishing it I really could not have asked for a more PEREFECT Ending!!!!!     LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED!!!!! This book!!!! The best of the 4 books in my humble opinion.
031606792X|3.0|Okay so this book was awesome but there was so much going on it was hard for me to keep up. Skillfully written, just so hay wire.
031606792X|4.0|I enjoyed Breaking Dawn as much as any of the other three books. It was generally well-written and exciting, perhaps not as action-packed as Eclipse or New Moon but it served as a kind of denouement to the series. It wasn't perfect but it was still riveting. For all you diehard fans who were disappointed by the way it turned out, deal with it.
B000O179EK|5.0|A classic. Don't miss the message in the movie: Lebowski seems very party guy and laid back, but is the only guy in the story with a lot of integrity and heart. Lebowski has conscious, and comes through in the end. A Classic! It's really a fun movie, that will make your Polish-Catholic heart proud.     Some other famous non-fictional Polish-American cool dudes: Axel Rose, Huey Lewis, Johnny Rzreznik (Goo Goo Dolls), Keith Urban, Clint Eastwood (Mother) and Ray Manzarek (Doors keybooards/writer) to name a few.

B0017I1FP8|4.0|Danny Elfman is the ultimate composer of the Batman theme and after the first two movies, he was gone and all the composers since then are in his shadow - seeking to write themes that suggest his from Batman and Batman Returns. I did not think a lot of the Batman Begins soundtrack as much of it can put one to sleep; the theme was not very complex but was not bad and worked in that movie. The new film and movie happily took the very best of the themes in Batman Begins and expanded and worked off them such that the soundtrack album is worth buying and listening to. The theme fades in and out nicely and worked in the film and works on the album. If the same composers write some more for the next Batman movie we will really have something to enjoy.
B000002H2H|5.0|I have never spent a better ten dollars than on this product! every song in it deserves praise and is a must for and metal fan!  1. fight fire with fire- probably one of their most fastest and heaviest songs! Awesome  2. Ride the lightning- Probably their best song on here! has the most epic solo ever made!  3. For whom the bell tolls- Amazing riffs, Amazing lyrics, Amazing song  4. Fade to black- sad but awesome solo and great riffs  5. Trapped under ice- A great song to scream along with!  6. Escape- Don't know too much about this song but its still pretty awesome  7. Creeping death- Simply amazing also one of their best on here  8. Call of the ktulu- its all instrumental but dont underestimate it! it has some really awesome riffs and a great solo
B000VZR75K|3.0|I remember I think it was like the third grade way back in 1977 when I was in a class of kids who liked Kiss. They were blasting \\"Do You Love Me\\" from the record which was on a cheesy classroom turntable where they would play \\"kiddie records\\". (The teacher wasnt there, I dont know where she was!) All the girls got mad, and when they heard \\"Do You Love Me?\\" from that song, one of the girls named Tammy screamed \\"I Hate Your Guts!!!!\\" LOL. I'll never forget that.
0321544080|5.0|Initially I dismissed this book but its grown on me. Like other reviewers I felt the title was misleading \\"Photography secrets from one of the world's top shooters\\"   Now that I've say down and started reading it. Its now one of my favourite books.     Especially as I am into strobist blog and use Nikon speedlights. There is another Joe McNally book on the way \\"The Hot Shoe Diaries\\"  and I will certainly be pre ordering it. If its anything like as informative as Dave Hobbies DVD Set.(Honestly once you've seen this DVD everything about off camera lighting just clicks together. Its mind blowing) I'll be very pleased.
031606792X|5.0|I was a little afraid to read this book.  I thought that it would have sad ending and ruin the series for me.  At last I have finished reading it.   For sure it is a bit different from the first three books, but it is not as horrible as some people says.    I throughly enjoyed Jacob's point of view, the antagonism between him and Rosalie was quite entertaining.    I read people complaints of Bella having a baby with a Vampire,  the baby's name, Jacob imprinting on a child.  This for me was quite irrelevant, as it is a fictional story.      What we have to remember first and foremost that it is a story from the author's imagination.  Accept it for what it is and move on.
031606792X|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read. It was shockinhg, thrilling, and just freaking amazing!<br />Out of all the twilight books this has been the best. There are new suprises every page! I love it! Long live the Twilight series. Thank you Stephenie Meyer for giving all of us something to look forward to and enjoy! -Mikaela
031606792X|5.0|Okay so i wrote a review yesterday and not only did i get rude people writing to me, they Bashed the book and myself funny! Writing blogs and stuff like it i normaly don't write correctly because its no big deal, but i can see people find it is so is this enough periods for you people........................................................................................................... haha anyway! Like i said in the first review and i will say it again, i feel you guys are all narrow minded!!! ENJOY THE DAM FAIRY TALE, HOW MUCH MORE DETAIL DO YOU WANT????????(ENOUGH QUESTION MARKS????) When i bought the book i didn't read the reviews until after and i really thought i bought a horrible book until i read it myself. The only thing i said was that people need to read it for themselves and not listen to all you haters. Why is it okay for you people on here to bash SM, LB and everyone else who worte a good review for this book, but the minute people who like the book start to disagree with what you said it's a war. You being narrow minded is my opinion. what do you realy care what i think about you? i don't care what anyone thinks about me. So i get hate comments for run on sentences? okay! why don't you do say something to the people who write in ebonic's. UGH! People just read the book yourself I have a life other then sitting on amazon.com all day fighting with people who leave reviews. Have a nice day!

0123694965|5.0|The Art of Game Design is a book which provides an easy read, it has a simplistic elegance to it, yet the depth of the book is quite deep which will keep you thinking for hours upon end. For me one of the most impressive things about the book is that it pretty much covers everything that a game designer should be aware of and how their decisions will effect the real world (it even talks about the moral obligations which I have never seen covered in a book about game design!). If you really want to learn the depth of being a game designer this book is a must read.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I bought this mostly for \\"You and Your Hand\\".  However, while that's still a favorite, \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is excellent as well as the \\"Stupid Girls\\" which is being played on air.  There is also a bonus track not listed that is done by Pink and her dad about his Vietnam War experience which is very good.  The insert to the cd (the paper thing with the lyrics) is also quite interesting.  It has many pictures and her \\"insights\\" to the cd, life, etc.  I would definitely recommend it, am glad I bought it and I will NOT be putting it on eBay as I do many cds I buy and don't care for!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|The 2007 brand new beautifully color enhanced version of \\"Miracle on 34th St.\\" is not the same color version as the one made in the '90's.  It is also certainly not the same as the first color version made in the '80's.  It's a brand new 2007 color technology produced color version.  Whoever thinks this is the same color version, be it the AFT color version of the '90's or the bad '80's color version is wrong, this is an excellently color enhanced 2007 version.  I know this for a fact because I watched the '90's A.F.T. version and the new Legend color version side by side as I watched this movie Christmas time 2007.  The new version is sharp, clear, colors are nice and bright (no more brownish or dark reds, the reds are now bright and red red) and the movie now looks like it was originally shot in color.  That's the best complement you can give a colorized movie.  It's beautiful.  Even some colors of things like ties, dresses, scenery background on the wall are different colors now than they were in the '90's color version.  Watching these side by side on a split screen I could see first hand the vast improvements this 2007 version is over the past color versions.  This ain't your Daddy's colorization anymore.  So get over the snob/elitist comments.  Welcome to a big beautiful colorful world.  B/W you're thru.  Now please color ALL the rest of the drab b/w movies and TV shows then I'll be in heaven.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|This band has gone through so much and always keeping in mind their fan base, as that for themselves is the key for more than 10 years with the original 9 guys that on stage put themselves in many dangers and passion for the music they make. This album is good, anyone who knows the Slipknot concept, keep this in mind, their writing style and projection towards society and the world we live in is realist and critical, so in terms of concept and lyrical work, this album is one of their strongest/mature. As for the sound I'd say in my total opinion and with total respect for the work they have done here, is not their unique sound like Iowa, but every Slipknot album sounds different... At first I didn't seem so eager to like the whole pack of songs, then I gave it a couple listens and realized, 9 guys, musicians, many years in the making of a comeback, there has to be something here, YES!! deep in each song is a meaning and powerful message of viewing things as they are... This album for me gets better with each listen. So if you have doubt on this one, remember my last thought... They got together for the love of art and music, and yes I know they'll get back on top with this one... This is one of the few bands that stay true to their essence in music and their options for fans and their urge for more...<br /><br />truly one great album, I'll get back to listening the whole thing, won't leave my cd players in quite a while!!!!!!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Who doesn't love a good period drama?  I'm certainly not such a person, so upon hearing the idea of a cable series set on the Madison Avenue advertising scene as the nation stood on the cusp of the 1960s had enormous appeal.  Especially interesting is the HBO-style (indeed, this was originally pitched as an HBO series, and shot down; I'm grateful, if only because the DVD prices would be that much more severe) unvarnished presentation of the era.  Moralists who romanticize this period as a haven of old-fashioned morality will be disappointed when confronted by the truth (or something like it) about contemporary attitudes.    Our main character is Don Draper (Jon Hamm, in a marvelous performance; it is surprising that he doesn't do more period work, because he's absolutely perfect for the look of the 1950s), the creative director at Sterling Cooper, a moderate-sized ad agency run by Roger Sterling (John Slattery, best known to me from \\"Jack & Bobby\\") and Bertram Cooper (Robert Morse).  He and his team, most notably newcoming Peter Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser, Angel's son Connor on \\"Angel\\"), are charged with marketing such illustrious products as cigarettes (and helping the company duck restrictions imposed by federal health agencies).  Don is something of a mystery both at work and at home, where his wife Betty (January Jones, in a revelatory performance; I'd previously never thought of her as anything other than a pretty face) is living a life of quiet desperation.  Through Don we see the life of a successful male executive; he's got a beautiful wife, more than one mistress on the side (proto-hippy Midge, then department store executive Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the only woman in the show not occupying a menial position, and she owes that to her father), and is friends with his boss Roger.  Below him, Campbell and his cohorts battle for favour and advancement.    Standout performances come from Hamm in the title role, Christina Hendricks as Joan, a secretary well-versed in using her sexuality to get what she wants (she'd be running the place if she lived 40 years later), and Elisabeth Moss as Peggy, a newby secretary with professional ambitions that are well beyond what is expected of women in that era, althoug timid Peggy doesn't seem the type to overtly identify with the feminist movement.    The DVD packaging has been a point of some contention here (see many of the 1-star reviews).  The original lighter-shaped box is a nifty design, though you do indeed have to watch while you close it (although the explanatory booklet in the back seems an effective shield on my set).
B0007MAO0M|4.0|Loved the film and the return to the classic western.  It left me wanting more . . . wish they'd have made a sequel.  The talent in the film was too good to have left a second film un-produced.    If you want a film that hits all the touchstones of the classic westerns, Silverado is the film for you.    My score = 75/100

B0000C16OQ|3.0|Is there any music lovers at Universal/Polydor? Is the money so important that you have to keep releasing the same old tired disc.  Love Is A Many Splendored Thing is chopped off at the end again!  Stop the insanity and release it thy way you know it should be. The way you would want to hear it. If the segway into Grease (reprise) is so important then include both on the disc. Please!!
0123694965|5.0|It's rare to find an instructional book on any topic that takes such a broad, holistic view of it's subject matter.  Not only is it loaded with useful info on game design, but many of it's methods can easily be applied to the creative process in general.  It's depth and breadth of thought set it easily above any other game design book I've come across.
B000URDEB0|4.0|Amaranth and Bye Bye Beautiful were the tracks that first turned me on to Nightwish, and I've since become a huge fan. After listening to their entire catalogue extensively, my conclusion is that this album includes some of their very best songs ever, unfortunately sandwiched in between some of their very worst.     First, the bad: Master Passion Greed is horrible- a mindless, unsophisticated, slogging number that doesn't serve this band's talent or personality well at all. Cadence of Her Last Breath, Whoever Brings the Night, For the Heart I Once Had, Meadows of Heaven and Sahara are all just average and somewhat boring. Sahara has a killer intro with that magical energy we're used to from Nightwish, but suddenly slows down and becomes an entirely different, uninteresting track.     The remaining songs illustrate the direction in which Nightwish should continue to move, in my opinion: The Poet and the Pendulum, though 13 minutes long, is incredibly dramatic and energetic and stacks up well against their other epics (Beauty of the Beast, Ghost Love Score, etc). Amaranth and Bye Bye Beautiful, the most accessible tracks, are both solid and enjoyable- good ones to use when introducing people to the band. Eva is a pretty ballad and Anette demonstrates her ability to invoke a lot of emotion through her vocals. The Islander and Seven Days to the Wolves are owned by Marco- his contribution to Nightwish's sound is huge. And finally, Last of the Wilds continues to blow me away- who else could combine pipes and a tin whistle with a metal foundation so effectively? Absolutely unique and one I always play for people who don't know Nightwish.     I know record companies do odd things, but for the life of me I can't figure out why the song \\"Escapist\\" wasn't included on this CD. It reminds me of Dark Chest of Wonders but completely belongs to Anette, and combines the metal and symphonic elements with that magical Nightwish energy. Awesome track!     Mr. Holopainen is a musical genius and I can't wait to hear what he does with their next album, when he'll be writing the songs specifically for Anette to sing. Tarja was amazing, but this is a new chapter and Tuomas is clearly the driving force behind the band's success. I have no doubt that the next Nightwish album will continue to push the symphonic metal envelop in new and exciting directions.
B00005B1W7|5.0|[[ASIN:B000REWYQ2 Nuremberg Trials (1947)]]Excellent story about what actually happened to the Jews in WWII.  It is long, it was a TV miniseries.  Well worth it!

0316143472|1.0|This book is just all right. It seems to be a repeat of everything else he has written.... decoratively funny, but not thought provoking.
031606792X|5.0|this was the best book i've ever read in my ENTIRE life.   i am straight up OBSESSED with these books.  Stephenie Meyer is my hero.
0156034026|5.0|Best book I've read in ages. Absolutely floored me. I was so into it that I read it at my desk at work because I had to find out what happened next.<br /><br />Instantly jumps to the top of my list of books I recommend to other people.
031606792X|5.0|this was an incredible book.  I read it in nearly four days! It takes the twilight series to a whole new level; almost more of an adult novel.  I would recomend these books to anyone from 15-99.
0143036556|5.0|Not quite as good as his best-known book, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", mostly because the first 50 pages are about Montana.  Who cares about Montana?  I barely even know where it is.  But after that it gets wicked awesome.  Unfortunately you can't really skip the Montana parts - too many concepts are introduced that you'll need later - but hey, it's Diamond; you can suck it up for 50 pages.  Vikings come later.  Vikings!
1400082773|3.0|Though I am not an American citizen and therefore I do not get a vote in the Nov election, I still find Obama an inspiring and interesting person.    As for the book, it's interesting but not that engaging.  It should be noted that the book was written over ten years ago and is not about his recent public political success and more about a young black boy growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia being raised by a white mother and her white grandparents.    I found the real star of the book is Barack's mother.  What an amazing woman.  She put everything into raising him.  At the beginning of the book, Barack writes, had he known his mother would not survive her cancer illness, he may have instead written a book about her (as a great parent) and not about the absent one.    The book is about growing up, making decisions and reconciliation - going back to Africa to meet his brothers, sisters and grandparents.    Growing up in Hawaii is the first part of the book.  Going to university in California and New York is the second part of the book and the final part is Barack going home to meet his relatives.  I find the latter half was better than the first half.    Reading the book, I found it astounding the level of detail he goes into describing each scene and what everyone said.  I later learned that names of characters have been changed to protect their privacy and the story is an approximation of what happened.  Barack is quite the storyteller.    I thought the book could have been edited a bit as it was long.    Interesting read as I didn't realize how strong he feels attached to his black roots.  There is so much separation in every scene who is black who is white.  I was surprised by that.  Very strong lines drawn between blacks and whites in his opinions.    Overall, if you want to know about the man before age 25, and how he formed his views and values, I think you may find this book to be an interesting insight.  It's not a page-turner but it does provide insight intothe man and his thought processes.

B001BKXUOQ|2.0|.....then my friend, you were definitely mistaken.  If there are any true Slipknot fans over the age of 15 out there, they should be completely disappointed with this piece of utter crap.  Its gotten to a point where it seems like Clown's drunken claim of them being the heaviest band out there has gotten to every single member of the band.  This album sucks from beginning to end.  All throughout the album you can barely make out anything Corey says with the exception of the few songs where he just sings.  This isn't music, this is noise.  Best thing about this album is that I live close to an Amoeba Music store that will buy ANY album off you and resell it used.  I can guarantee you, this album will have a lot of company at that store.
159102594X|5.0|I was a little worried about ordering and reading this book because I haven't read any fantasy for about twenty years. I had gotten more than a little tired of the formulaic plotting, one-dimensional characters, and the stereotypes that drive the genre. However, when Scott Lynch released \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" a few years back, I succumbed to the hype, bought the book, and devoured it over a weekend. It was wonderful, and I found myself wanting more of the same recently. The Blade Itself looked like it might be similar in literary style, so I ordered it and away I went again.<br /><br />This was a wonderful book, with extremely well-drawn complex characters. You won't find any one-dimensional good guys or bad guys within this book. All the protagonists (you can't really call them good guys) have serious character flaws and have to struggle with a flawed, unforgiving world and some very difficult, real-world choices. Their white hats may be a little dirty, but this made them extremely interesting characters to read about it. I was rapt and knocked this book out in about a day...partially because the writing style was smooth and eminently readable, partly because I didn't put the book down at all. It was too compulsively enjoyable.<br /><br />While I loved the excellent character development, from Logen, the barbarian who has grown wise enough that he seeks to avoid fighting (unsuccessfully), to Sand van Glokta, the former dashing and heroic cavalry officer who was tortured for years, and now, as a cripple, serves his king as a torturer himself, to Bayaz, the ancient wizard who is rude, condescending and just generally pissy, there is so much more to appreciate about this book as well. It realistically creates a nasty gritty world; bureacracy, self-aggrandizement, cupidity and stupidity are the order of the day within the Union, the monarchial state these characters cluster around. In fact it is reminiscent of 19th century Russia in many ways, which was a pretty grim place. However, the Union is a shining beacon of tolerance and hope compared to the rest of the world which is ravaged by slave states, cannibals, vast incessant wars, and the Shanka, an orc-like species.<br /><br />The plotting is excellent.....there is, of course, a quest centered around a mythic object, but Abercrombie destroys the stereotypical quest conventions fairly well too. You're not even really sure what the quest is because Bayaz doesn't like to explain himself and Logen isn't really interested in knowing. That sounds like there isn't a plot, but there is indeed, and Abercrombie spins it out slowly and surely which was so much more intersting that just jamming the quest down your throat.  His plotting approach is both literary and interesting, and turns ordinary conventions on their heads.<br /><br />I liked this book so much, I immediately went to the bookstore and bought the second installment and finished that in less the 24 hours. Now I'm just waiting for the final installment to be delivered to me. I whole-heartedly recommend this book. I still would be reluctant to read fantasy in general, but anything by Scott Lynch or Joe Abercrombie I am going to scoop up immediately.er, the Union is a shining beacon of tolerance and hope compared to the rest of the world which is ravaged by slave states, cannibals, vast incessant wars, and the Shanka, an orc-like species.

B0018OAPAW|5.0|Soooo Offspring! By now, most bands would have broken up, started writing sickening love songs, or had an unfortunate suicide but this is one of the few bands that stays true to its roots.    Other reviews were on the money, none of the tracks have me pressing the >> button and that classification falls to less than 1% of the stuff in my music collection.
0060820985|5.0|No surprises here - just predictable, but very feel good story.  This was my first time with the author and I probably won't follow her closely, as I do some, but next time I want something light and comforting, I would get another of the \\"shop\\" stories.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|1 Star earned for the cinematography which is good but is unfortunately accompanied by a pointless, plotless morass of auteur garbage called the movie & screenplay.  Pointless by design, it seems to be an exercise in amusement for Mr. Anderson at his absolute theft of a movie studio's budget and waste of perfectly good actors and the viewer's time.  Having found some of his past movies (Rushmore & Royal...) to be funny, I thought I would enjoy this movie as well.  While the same snappy dialogue is present, the even thinner and frankly much more boring plotline wastes any goodwill built up by conversations that sound different from any you are used to hearing in movies or in life.  Instead, the obtuse nature of the plot and dialogue that sometimes add humor to Anderson's movies, this time only serve to anger the viewer who has invested time waiting for something, ANYTHING, to HAPPEN to move the snorefest along and generate some kind of empathy, connection or care for any of the movie's characters and what happens to them.  Overall, I would say that the number one problem with the movie is that no time is spent developing the characters (as achieved with the detached narration present in the prior Anderson movies) and with no care or investment in the characters themselves due to the complete hatred you feel towards them, the movie and play about their fate fails to generate the slightest interest.  Do yourself a favor and skip this pretentious waste of time.
B00188KD1Y|5.0|Death Race is action packed from start to finish.  It is well written, taking us through the emotions it intends.  The casting was perfect.  The stunts are fun.  The dialogue seems realistic enough.    As long as you know and like the premise of the movie, you will like this.  It's a dark revenge movie with death for nearly everyone.
1845761502|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Hollywood creature effect designers such as Stan Winston, Rick Baker, Patrick Tatopoulos, and many others. So when I have a knowledge of the existence of this book, I immediately ordered my copy. Boy, was my satisfactions all fulfilled. It's a choke load with details of Stan Winston's life, and the creations of iconic Stan Winston Studio.<br /><br />The author managed to divide the chapters in the books into periods that mark the creations of Stan's legendary creatures. Aliens, Terminators, Predators, and the Jurassic Park's Dinosaurs lead the pack with the rest of the other smaller profiled Winston characters are featured in comprehensive and glorious coverages. Great stills, conceptual designs, behind the scene materials, whatever you ask for, this books fulfills. The writing by Jody Duncan is also very informative without being tiresome.<br /><br />And I can get enough of Crash McCreery's artworks. One of Stan Winston's most prolific conceptualizers, his designs brought to life many of SWS monster charcaters. Here's hoping that one day, somebody will publish an \\"Art of Crash McCreery\\" book.
B000I0QM04|5.0|Above average comic book movie. Story was silly but so were most of the movies made in the 30s. This was along the line of the ole Buck Rogers fantacies but with the benefit of state of the art special effects.    The delivery of High Def via Blu-ray was beyond excellent!    Amazon's delivery of this product was excellent!
031606792X|5.0|I met Stephanie Meyers about 4 months ago and she seemed absolutely excited to release Breaking Dawn, and now that I've read all the HARSH comments about it, I'm honestly, well, not outraged, but close.     First of all, if you do not like it, don't trash it OR her. You love her other books and now you're saying, \\"What has she done?!\\" \\"BURN IT!\\" Are you a fan? Absolutely not. You are most likely a child and/or upset you did not get your way.     Secondly, SHE DID WHAT SHE COULD. How much thicker do you want this book to be, huh? YES she did cram a lot into it, and SO WHAT? She did it to make the fans happy! She wanted to give YOU- THE READERS- something to remember her by! I mean she honestly gave us the shocks we wanted, the surprises and the turns that books like Harry Potter also gave. Had she killed someone, would you have been upset? YES. You probably would have been more upset than you are now! Had Bella been with Jacob would you have been upset? Now some would say no, but the majority of you would have torn the book in half. The point is, YES there is a lot from pregnancies to sex, but you asked for it. WE asked for it. It was what we wanted. STOP COMPLAINING.     Thirdly, you are being truly rude. Return the book if you want, but that just makes you a fool. Re-read it and THEN decide because honestly, you have to give her some credit, SHE CAN WRITE. Of course, if you want to be a child and complain and say that it was THE WORST BOOK EVER, then go right ahead, but stop posting it because would you tell Stephanie Meyers TO HER FACE that she made the biggest mistake of her life by writing Breaking Dawn and that you're going to burn it? Probably not. So shut up.     I LOVED the book. Much more grown up, much more... more and it made you think, \\"Dang, I need to re-read that!\\" Of course she isn't JK Rowling and of course she isn't Anne Rice, but she did a dang good attempt and I rate her as the top few authors in the WORLD to get this much popularity in just a fewshort years. She's an artist, admit it.
0385721234|2.0|This book is a classic in Literature in Spanish, but please don't buy this edition from Anchor Books.  It has a lot of typos and spelling mistakes that a good editor would never allow.<br /><br />It was a very disappointing buy... but a great story regardless.  That is why it gets 2 stars and not one.

B00139W3NE|2.0|I imagine the books are actually more descriptive than the movie for I found this to be somewhat confusing at times. The premise itself lasts for a mere few moments in the film, but, while it sounded interesting, I am sure it is better and more clearly explained in the book. All this talk of Dust and Daemons and witches and prophecies, it was all just too much to fit into the span of 2 hours.     The acting is all quite good, though Daniel Craig is barely in the film. The special effects are truly wonderful and first rate and is really the only thing that keeps your interest.    The plot is all over the place and jumbled. And it is certainly not helped by the awful editing. It jumps way too quickly from scene to scene and we never really know how much time has passed. That is probably the biggest flaw of the film, next to the script.    Furthermore, the ending that pretty much leaves off in the middle of nowhere is desperately in need of a sequel. But from what I have heard, since the movie turned out to be not so profitable, no word of a second movie has been heard, which is unfortuate. Perhaps as a trilogy, as it was meant to be, it can turn out to be a perfectly watchable and possibly enjoable film. But as it stands right now, it is unimpressive and pointless.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|Renee Zellweger is absolutely charming in this lovely rendition of Beatrix Potter. I was very fortunate to have visited the Lake District and to visit Beatrix Potter's farm. This movie reminded me of how magnificent the countryside is and her efforts to preserve the beauty of this area brought back some wonderful memories. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll clap your hands as if you were reading her books for the first time.
0061122416|1.0|Maybe this book is somehow better read quietly on your own.  We heard so many good things about it that we read it as a family.  We were rolling on the ground laughing at the lame conversations with the boy, his heart, the wind, etc.  If you are seeking good life advice, read Ben Franklin's autobiography and his selected writings.  But life is far too short to waste any of it on this silly tale.

B000QFCD2W|3.0|As a devoted KD fan who has been listening to him for 17 years and has loved almost everything he and his band have ever done, it pains me to have to give this latest album only three stars. Nevertheless, along with The Spider's Lullabye, I think it's KD's weakest album. That doesn't mean it's BAD by any means, but I've been spoiled over the years by KD consistently delivering BRILLIANT albums, and this one just doesn't rise to that level. Now, the singing and musicianship are great as always, and the guitar solos are among the most amazing I've ever heard from La Rocque and Wead, which is saying a lot. But the overall songwriting just doesn't grab me the way it does on KD's older stuff. That's a matter of taste, of course, but I prefer the more complex, dissonant, and \\"progressive\\" material that can be found on nearly all of King's earlier albums: I consider every one of Fatal Portrait, Abigail, Abigail II, Them, Conspiracy, The Eye, and House Of God to be ESSENTIAL. Listen to GMYSP and (say) Conspiracy back-to-back, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about: the older album sounds much fresher, more sophisticated, and more interesting. If you already own those earlier albums, then you should go ahead and get GMYSP. It's certainly worth having, especially for the godly guitar solos. But if you're just getting into King Diamond, I'd start with one of those \\"essentials\\" first.
B00003CXTG|4.0|After watching this movie I thought it was pretty good going on great. Then after reading the bad reviews I think the problem is that some people in historic/war movies look SO far into history and the exact little details that may be a little different in the actual movie.     Bottom line is when making a movie you can't show everything totally realistic and perfect. If you do that it will be just another educational documentary about pearl harbor.     You have to have main characters and you have to show the story of the horrible attack that was made on pearl harbor at the same time. I think they accomplished that very well. They showed the fiction love story and how the characters were living before the attacks as a lead in. Then Danny dies at the end to show how the attacks must have affected people personally who were involved, or had anyone close to them involved with pearl at all. The huge 40 minute scene of the Attack is in my opinion greatly done and shows the destruction brutally and vividly. Then when they show the first attack back, they were trying to show how America would band together, grow stronger, and eventually win WWII. I also must add all the actors did a very good job in their roles.    This movie was shown very well with great acting great special effects with i must add a great tandem being Bruckheimer/Bay. Also, screenwriter Randall Wallace who wrote Braveheart. Some people also have a problem with the love story but I think it goes good with the movie especially more on a personal and touching level after the attacks. And hell if you can deal with the love story in Titanic don't attempt to diss the love story in Pearl Harbor. So people need to stop looking so much into it and watch it for what it is. A MOVIE!!
B0018BB21G|4.0|I have the first two Moody Blues albums in the new 2008 remastered format so far.  \\"In Search Of The Lost Chord\\" is the most psychedelic of all Moody releases.  The new remaster sounds really crisp and clean.  The drums sound especially good, compared to previous cd issues, on which they have a muddy sound.  Ray's flute sounds brilliant with all the other exotic instruments on this album.  There is a certain warmth that is missing on this re-issue.  I have read about the use of a \\"quad\\" version for these remasters, but the 1997 remasters, to me, hardly beat the first cd issues of these classics from the beginning of the cd era.  I always knew they could sound better.  The only complaint I have at this point is that the 2008 remaster of \\"Days Of Future Passed\\" has really obvious crackling sounds in the master tapes after the song \\"Peak Hour.\\"  But, the bonus tracks, more than anything else, have made these remasters worth their cost.  Only four songs from \\"Prelude (1966 - 1969)\\" haven't appeared on one of these '67-'68 Moody Blues remasters.  \\"Please Think About It,\\" which sounds like a '50s R&B classic, was always one of my favorites from that collection.  \\"Long Summer Days\\" was also very good, not to forget \\"Gimme A Little Somethin'\\" and \\"King & Queen.\\"  Anyway, I will probably purchase the remaining \\"Core 7\\" 2008 remastered Moody Blues cds in the near future.  So far, the two I have purchased have been worth the price.
B001ESZNPY|5.0|This album is good, if you're a knot fan its truly splendid!  I don't know why I love this crap noise style music but I just can't seem to get enough.  After listening to this album, it is \\"more\\" similar to Slipknot's first album and a touch of Stone Sour (purity-ish).  I heard it was going to be more like Iowa (personal fav) but no definitely more like the first one, with the technicality of the vol 3.  There is some slow songs and not all thrash, but its still got that Slipknot sound.  You can definitely tell Thompson and Root went from being  really good guitar players (1st album) to just down right nasty!  Musically it is brutal nasty defecation of garbage and blah!  So yah, pretty loud and pretty swell......  PHSYCOSOCIAL!!!
B0018O4YT0|5.0|The main criticism I had about the original DVD release of this movie was the opening voiceover, which I felt was unnecessary and contained major 'spoilers'. It now transpires that this was added at the insistence of the studio who did not trust the audience to have the wit or patience to follow the story as it unfolds.  Thankfully, this new version omits the voiceover and adds a few other minor edits to restore the director's original vision.  It was also irritating to learn that the restrictive 'R' rating was given for the absurd reason that the movie was 'too weird' rather than a result of any sexual or violent content.  This underrated movie deserves to become a genre classic. As a more personal creation by writer/producer Proyas than his later \\"I, Robot\\" and for several outstanding performances, particularly Kiefer Sutherland as the tortured Dr Schreber.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|This movie was really good! Lots of action, mystery and a part of history that was interesting to learn about. I understand, not everything in the movie was acurate but it was BASED around a real story - and that works for me.  It was a R-rated movie for a reason(violence and sex). I was on the edge of my seat!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Well, many thanks to the GM Olympic ad which has led me and many people to \\"discover\\" Brandi Carlile. \\"The story\\" is a great album and the title song, \\"the story\\" is still my favorite. Her voice has excellent resonance, very captivating.
160459201X|5.0|This is my favorite edition of this book. I am so much more satisfied with Dr. Murphy's words, rather than the rewritten version that the other publisher has. I don't understand why you'd want to rewrite such a wonderful and well written book. The original is almost always the best, certainly it is in this case. The power of positive thinking is alive and well!

B000RW3YYA|4.0|Stargate Atlantis is a great show!  The third season is full of surprises and ends in a classic cliffhanger.  Can't wait to get season 4!  Stargate is a little more realistic than Star Trek - you actually feel like it could be happening now.  I love that there is a nice mix of drama and humor - they're really good at poking fun at sci-fi in general.

B00006I53S|2.0|Shame on Canon. I got this lens as part of a package when I bought a Canon 40D camera. I thought it would be great with IS and all, but I was sadly mistaken. The images are soft and the IS doesn't really help much. Fortunately I still had a Sigma 17-70mm lens that I got for my Canon 350D and I use this lens most of the time because I get the IQ that I am used to getting and the Canon 28-135mm lens is just a great disappointment. I wish I had spent the extra $200 on an alternate lens. I hope someone will want to buy this Canon lens from me. It's the only Canon lens I own and I am sorely disappointed with it. It is in a box collecting dust!
6305428050|4.0|This is one of my favourite movies, yet it seemed to get lost back when it was released.     Chris (Elizabeth Shue) is stuck babysitting when her best friend decides to run away from home and then has second thoughts, only she has no money to catch a cab home. Chris with kids in tow are left to rescue her, resulting in fun and adventure.    Directed by Chris Columbus, (need I say more ??) it keeps moving at a great pace. Great for the kids, except for some course language, this should be (just about) enjoyed by everyone.     Go For It !!!

B000ZN802W|4.0|I ask this because what in the world did his sister do to him for him to treat her that way?  I completely disagree with the way he treated his parents as well, he was just a total brat, however I can and do understand his reaction IF what he was saying about his parents was true.  But I again go back to my original question, what did his sister do to him?<br /><br />***SPOILER WARNING*****<br /><br />In the end he should have just died when his car was hit with the flood.  His parent's would have mourned his loss anyway and been effected the same way without a moose having to give up its life later for absolutely nothing.<br /><br />UPDATED review July 3, 2011 - I saw this movie again last night in my pastor's house with a group and we discussed it afterward.  I must say that seeing it a second time several years later and having children of my own at that age, I have definitely softened my view of the movie and of Chris as well. My original review had everything to do with his callousness and disregard he had for his family and in particular to his sister which I still maintain.  He spoke about all of the damage people do to each other yet seemed to fail to see the damage he himself was doing.  Ultimately he was still just a kid with a lot to learn. He complained about all of the hypocrisy in the world and the hurt that people do to each other, yet other than being beat up after being taken off a train, he was treated well and shown kindness along his journey by \\"people\\". He was abused (mostly by seeing his mother physically and mentally abused) which was confirmed by his sister - so it wasn't as if he made all of that up. I never had an issue with his choice to get away from it all or to put himself in danger - he has that right and I don't think it was ever his intention to get himself killed.  He wasn't as prepared as he should have been, though his death was still more of an \\"accident\\" than anything else. From his journal and what he told others, he had every intention of getting out of the location he was in and seeing the friends he made along the way again.  Maybe even returning home at some point. There are definitely some great lessons to take from the movie and I wish that I could have set aside my initial emotions to see more of the overall story way back during my initial review.

B000XUBC5E|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic. Harlan Coben has a great writing style and this novel filled with twists right up to the very last page. This is the first of Coben's novels that I've read but it looks like they all have solid reviews. I'm definately a fan and plan to read all of his novels.
015206396X|4.0|I found this book quite enjoyable, and think it could develop into a popular series.  I'll do my best to review it without giving away any details.    The characters:  Po - I found him a bit annoying, and not always consistent.  There was an arrogance about this character that I felt would have made it hard for Katsa to be really attracted too.  In the beginning I found him rather smarmy, like a used car salesman.  Particularly when Katsa learned his true grace.    Bitterblue - Her character wasn't developed too a great degree.  As a small child that could be hard to do, and does give the author some flexibility in the future.    Leck - He was a decent villain, although a little over the top with the torture and cruelty.  I did end up wondering why with his power he didn't initially seek to expand his borders.    Katsa - Well, she is an extremely cool hero, sort of a female Wolverine from the X-men.  The fight scenes she is involved in are well written.  Her character develops nicely as she determines her actual grace.  I didn't really believe why she'd be attracted to Po.  Towards the end she did cry a bit more than I would have expected of a character with her strength.  But overall, a very fun hero for this book.    Now onto the book.  The first half of the book moves pretty slowly.  There are a couple of cool scenes, but for the most part it exists to introduce the setting, and characters.  There are  a number of characters that don't seem to have much of a role in this book, I can only assume they exist to introduce them for subsequent books.  That's not a bad thing in my opinion.    The action in the second half of the book picks up quite a bit.  The resolution of the major conflict comes fast.  Initially I didn't like that, but the more I thought about it, explosive violence is fast, so it made sense to write in that manner.  There are some twists and turns along the way to the end.  As well as one shocking twist later on.    The only real complaint I had wasthat in a couple of sections the characters take a break from logic.  In these sections the author seems to beat the decisions to death, as if trying to convince you they make sense.  I found myself thinking \\"this idea doesn't make much sense\\" suspending belief (it is a young persons book and a fantasy) and moving on.    Overall I'd say this book was quite enjoyable.  Don't give up on it early on, it progresses nicely, and is a fun read.
B0017MO10U|4.0|I still enjoyed the movie, but it could have been much better. It felt like the plot was just starting to build up then the movie was suddenly over.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Great movie. Interesting story. A fitting end to the series. I do hope that in future another film is made. Perhaps with a larger budget and theatrical release.
B0015HS5S6|5.0|I honestly thought the trend with movie companies was that when they have tremendous success with their first and second films they eventually begin to slide in quality. At least until they hit that next big pinnacle film that makes them a massive wad of cash. Pixar have done the impossible with Finding Nemo. As their 5th feature film Finding Nemo was equally as solid and original as its predecessors, and if anything it has surpassed them.<br /><br />Set deep in the coral reef of Australia, a family of clown fish are one day attacked by a Barracuda leaving the Father Marlin and one egg. Flash forward a few years and that egg is a young clown fish named Nemo who's been raised by his overprotective Father. One day while at school and becoming tired of his dads suffocating ways, Nemo ignores his dads order to come away from a human boat. Nemo goes and touches the boat, but unfortunately it leads to Nemo being kidnapped by a diver, catching fish for a small aquarium. Nemo's dad Marlin must now set on a quest towards Sydney harbour to try and Find Nemo. Along the way he becomes friends with a Regal Tang fish called Dory who suffers from short term memory loss, but is still very optimistic. She joins Marlin in his quest to find Nemo, although Marlin does have to keep reminding her why she's with him. Along the way they encounter psychotic practising vegetarian sharks, deadly jellyfish and turtles riding the waves. Nemo on the other hand is trapped inside a small fish tank in a dentists surgery, he befriends the fish locked up with him and hopes for eventual help.<br /><br />As you can see from the plot this is simply a formula of crazy success and pure hilarity. The formula works wonders and delivers a film not just beautiful to look at, but something to wet your pants with laughter. The companion Dory and the vegetarian sharks are just insanely unique and make this movie special in itself. Dory, voiced by Ellen Degeneres is just loveable and admirable with her unmeasurable optimism and her talent to speak whale. With the adventure of Marlin (Albert Brooks) & Dory on their quest the film also focuses on Nemo trying to break out of the tank before he's given to the dentists daughter as a pet. Led by the crafty Gill (Willem Defoe) and helped by the other tank fish, they hatch a plan which will allow Nemo his last chance of freedom.<br /><br />I did mention that it was beautiful to look at and I wasn't kidding. The scale of the ocean is second to none, and the animators seem to be looking to display the true scale of their quest. The beginning reef scene is something to be witnessed and I can't imagine how cool it would look on Blu-Ray. This is a film with a script and plot with confidence, Pixar do what they do best and they give us a quality film that teaches us a good lesson about letting go when the time is right while still having the entire family in stitches.<br /><br />The term family film is thrown around a lot when relating to Disney or other children's movies. I can honestly say that Finding Nemo is one of the only movies to fit that perfectly. It teaches the parents a lesson about knowing when to let their kids make their own mistakes, while showing the kids the importance of friendship and respect for our elders. It has the typical childish humour while throwing in the odd adult joke that will go straight over the kids heads.<br /><br />A great film all round and I sincerely can't wait for it to be on Blu-Ray.her talent to speak whale.

B001BGTWXI|4.0|So Vol. 3 in my opinion was weak.  Not to mention after it was released i heard slipknot was taking a long vacation, well life acting like it usually does, that seemed like yesterday, now we have all hope is gone.  In my heart when i first heard about this i thought great vol. 3 repeat, lets throw some more stone sour vocals over a weakened slipknot song.  Now if you've noticed how many stars I rated it, you'll know i was happily mistaken.  True it doesn't capture the same intensity as the first album, but every band has its progression, its very possible that they could have leaned more toward bands like Black Dahlia, or As Blood Runs Black, but at the heart of slipknot lies something more reminiscent of the nu metal days.  This album isnt the heaviest thing ever, but to enjoy it remember two things, one its slipknot, not slayer, and two its definitely better than Vol. 3.  Overall their best effort since Iowa, cohesive, violent, and good.
031606792X|2.0|I have to say I was very dissapointed with the way this last installment of the Twilight Saga was written.  Instead of sticking with pre-established parameters and character profiles, the book became a \\"fix it all\\" story, with everyone's lives tying up nice and neatly.  It aired very similar to some of the fanfiction about the very same series that I've seen on the net.    Even with Mrs. Meyer's original vampire lore and regulations (which I found interesting and refreshing from all the Stoker/Shrek standard lore), it stretched the boundaries too far from believable.  Personality traits of well establish characters seemed to be thrown out the window, rules and the very biology of the characters seemed to be dismissed and while I do enjoy a \\"happily ever after\\" ending, this one connected each and every loose end, making it even less plausible and likeable.    I applaud Mrs. Meyers for her first three books, but having read Breaking Dawn once, I am putting it on my shelf and will probably never pick it up again.  I look forward to her next venture, and hopefully will find it much better.
B0016NF06O|5.0|I really enjoyed this collaboration. I wish I could have been in the audience.  I'm guessing Wynton and Willie had a great time.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|This was a fantasy film, as with most Daniel Day-Lewis films. However, at times I nearly had to turn off the sound because I found the music score was the worst I had ever heard. That would include ALL Ed Wood films and the music of The New World. Not sure what the music director was trying to accomplish, it did NOT work.
B001BKXUOQ|3.0|Good album but sadly only half the songs are briliant.  Why not just cut the good ones and leave the mediocre ones for later on singles or b sides.    Sadly not as good as Slipknots dirst album and Iowa.  Subliminal verses was disappointing for me with only a few good songs.
031606792X|3.0|I read this book (after just recently starting the entire Twilight saga) while taking a break from studying for exams, so I enjoyed it as a fun alternative to the textbooks I was pouring over. I admit to reading the spoilers before getting my copy, but instead of that ruining the story for me, I think it sort of braced me for some very unexpected plot twists that I would not have been ready for. I have to agree with some previously mentioned reviews that some of those plot twists were...well, ridiculous to say the least. However, the story was interesting enough for me to keep reading. I also had to keep in mind that the entire saga is basically a literary soap opera of teenage romance, so I tried my best not to get too over-analytical or disappointed. Overall, besides some of the obvious lapses, I enjoyed reading this book for what it was and still lightly consider myself a fan of the series.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|While I wouldn't place this film in the highest echelon of cinematic masterpieces, it is extremely enjoyable and well written.  Though not funny in a ha-ha sense, it is consistently witty and had me and my friend chuckling at almost every line.  The Barcelona setting and the physical attributes and charisma of the cast are fully exploited to make the film a visual feast.  And, if you ever fell in love while spending a summer abroad as a student, it will pack plenty of nostalgic resonance.

B000FA5QZ4|4.0|I loved this story.  I won't go into much detail, because there are so many other reviews.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars (instead of five) was because of the low quality of the Kindle eBook.<br /><br />The proofreading was HORRIBLE. Words were missing; punctuation was missing; words wereruntogether (get it?); some word swere split and joined to the next word (get it?).<br /><br />I really love reading the eBooks on the Kindle, but this is a good example of a book where the quality control was severely lacking.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I have to admit that this movie had a slow start for me. I tried watching it twice and tired out both times. But then on one sleepless night I gave it a third time and was completely engaged until the very end. I have to confess that my attention span has been conditioned by Hollywood, where plot takes off within a few minutes. With Tokyo Godfathers, traditional storytelling takes the stage, and important character development stacks up at the beginning, making for a very fun, very eventful second half to the movie. The combination of the three characters becomes a circus as half-truths from everyone involved suddenly starts to clash. The comedy is very sophisticated, even when it is slapstick, and exceeds the standards of most hollywood humor. The ending is absolutely flawless. I'm so glad I didn't give up on this movie.

B00000G3AZ|4.0|1996's EMMA brings us a quasi-modern version of the Austen masterpiece, starring a lovable Gwyneth Paltrow as our heroine Miss. Emma Woodhouse .<br /><br />Of course there are a few things to consider upon watching this film;<br /><br />1. If you prefer a film that maintains the basis of the author's story but strays in order to entertain the majority of a movie-going audience, or a more precise visualization of the text in it's original and actual entirety.<br /><br />2. If you can enjoy a less serious approach to the tale.<br /><br />Not to mention slight character changes and so on and so forth. (You almost feel like your watching the spawn of Emma, a.k.a. 1995's Clueless.)<br /><br />With that said, in this film Emma has a brilliant joy and although I find myself frustrated with her for being so blind in her matchmaking decisions one still feels for her and sympathizes with her pains.<br /><br />If all else fails just watch the garden scene at the end, Mr.Knightley(Jeremy Northam) is almost dreamy enough to challenge Darcy.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This is a very good game of strategy.  The directions are pretty confusing for a first-timer - best to play with someone experienced the first few times.  With each game we figure out a bit more about strategy.  It requires a fair amount of brain work, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is younger than a teen or someone who doesn't like to think.  I can see becoming an addict and buying some of the add-ons.
B000VS6R26|5.0|and now have it in my dvd collection. It's been over a decade, but Titanic is a timeless masterpiece that never goes out of date. This movie has a little bit of everything in it...action, romance,...you laugh...you cry. Leo and Kate made us care about what happened to them. I think one of the reasons this movie has touched so many people is becauce, quite honestly, we are looking for a love like this...a love this deep...this profound. Am I ready to go back to Titanic?...Always. And I would recommend this to anyone.
B00005JPFH|4.0|I'd avoided watching Spider Man in the theatres because everyone told me it was too long, etc.  As a long time Marvel fan - I enjoyed this a lot.  I think this one hit the spot.  Sam Raimi has made a love story cum heroic epic.  The effects are spectacular (topping the previous two shows) and really reflect the comic book world that Spider Man comes from.  The Sandman is pure Steve Ditko, and Venom's effects are brilliantly executed.  Acting wise, Tobey Maguire and Mary Jane are the same - but this time Peter Parker has to deal with a Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde persona and a coterie of supervillains - just like the original comic.  Let's hope there's a sequel...
B0017MO10U|5.0|This is one of the best movies thus far in the Stargate movie selection.  Both encompassing to the realization of 10 years of the series, to thrilling action and characterization.  You will not want to miss the end of Baal.

0312427999|5.0|Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" weaves together the systematic oppression of South American countries, the \\"help\\" given to Poland, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the current war in Iraq. Spotting the common threads in each instance, she then holds up the tsunami victims alongside the city of New Orleans to show the same benificiaries of government spending getting rich again. In every case, the parallel is drawn between the attempt to shape the client country's future and the medical technique of \\"shock therapy\\".

0618918248|1.0|\\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by its Creator into a few forms or into one;...\\"  These are the closing lines in a Mentor, paper-back edition of the 'Origin of Species' published in 1958 that I own. Do I have a 'doctored' copy or did Richard Dawkins skip the 'Creator' part on purpose while quoting it?    I was astonished by the brilliance of the 'Selfish Gene'. That book was razor sharp in its theories and far-reaching in its conclusions. No matter how much you think, no matter how angry and frustrated you feel, you cannot find fault with its conclusions. The Selfish Gene was fantastic. This book was garbage. I do not say this because I am a religious person - in fact I am very minimally religious, who just believes that there are questions about this universe that cannot be answered. In fact, in the 'Selfish Gene' Dawkins himself says (don't have the book with me for the exact quote) that '  originally there were simple molecules, that aggregated for survival. Somewhere along the line consciousness developed. How it developed and what exactly it (consciousness) is, is beyond the scope of this book and does not affect the theories of the selfish gene'. This was a perfect disclaimer which, in fact, made me respect him. This book plunges into areas that no one has answers to.   Religion, to begin with, is ambiguous. What exactly is it? Is it what the originator uttered, or is it something that followers believe in? If theoretically there were no religions (not practical, given the human paradox of where the selfish gene wants to survive and the mind questions the futility of it because of its own inevitable end), would that solve most of the world's problems? Wouldn't politicians and people simply find other reasons to divide and dislike? What about racial discrimination? That doesn't seem to be religiously motivated.    This book in my opinion was a lost cause from page one. Whatever happened to this brilliant man and why he ever embarked on this book is beyond me.
B000AP04MO|5.0|As a callow teenager, I didn't think much of this film. Now older & married, I appreciate it more & more each time I see it, discovering something new & insightful with each new viewing. Mark & Joanna seem like old friends to me now.<br /><br />It's a fascinating piece of work, an intersection between the classic era of Hollywood filmmaking (then drawing to an end) & the fresh, experimental techniques of the 1960s. Does this make it a period piece? Well, it's certainly of its time ... but in a good way, as it embodies all the energy & vivid sense of life from that decade. And its somewhat golden, romantic glow is really timeless, since memories of the first days of love are so idealized & wondrous.<br /><br />The cross-cutting between years is especially effective here, reinforcing the sense of memories under review, one leading to another in no particular order. The repetition of certain scenes & lines of dialogue, with VERY different emotional tones over the years, conveys the changes in this marriage succinctly & sharply.<br /><br />And then there's the look of it! Audrey Hepburn & Albert Finney are both stunningly attractive, radiating beauty & sexuality with all the fire of the French sun above their heads. It's particularly good to see Hepburn playing a grown woman in all of her complexity -- while there was never a screen gamine to match hers, she was capable of so much more, and proves it here. Plus, she wears stylish clothes like a dream!<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about Albert Finney's portrayal of Mark -- self-centered, even brutal in his drive & confidence, so absolutely sure of his handsome irresistibility. But I think those are some of the qualities that attracted Joanna in the first place. She wanted someone to match her ... because of course she's just as aware of her own considerable qualities.<br /><br />Does this make them shallow, self-absorbed? I don't think so. For any couple in love, especially in the prime of youth, there's really nobody else in the world -- certainly nobody else to match themselves. But as time goes by & a little more reality sets in, we see how they struggle & often stumble, trying to adjust to so many changes. Life has a way of overtaking the first blaze of romance, and not every marriage survives it.<br /><br />And that's the question, after all. Can marriage survive the inevitabilities of growing up? \\"Two for the Road\\" explores that question in a meandering but surprisingly in-depth fashion. Along the way it provides us with a remarkable portrait of a couple, an era, and a classic style of filmmaking. The highly informative & entertaining commentary track by director Stanley Donen only adds to the pleasures of this film. Enthusiastically recommended!y nobody else to match themselves.

0061091480|5.0|I read this book as a teenager over 25 years ago as a required text in a college class called psychology of human relations. I grew up being afraid of my own shadow, I was \\"so shy.\\" This book helped me to realize the errors in my thinking that were holding me back from being the person I knew I could be. It also helped me to realize that I was responsible for my own happiness and that others could not control my thoughts and emotions, only I could. I also realized it is not fair to other people for me to depend on them to make me happy. Next to the holy scriptures, I think this book has helped me more than any other book to realize happiness and joy in life. Recently 25 years later, I found the book in a box and decided to read it again. I have bought several copies and given them to friends that I thought could benefit from reading it. It truly is  good advice!
B00139W3NE|3.0|I watched this movie with no memory or knowledge of the controversy surrounding its release.  Apparently both sides of the religion and free speech argument had plenty to say.  I'm not here to stir that pot.  Certainly the controversy precipitated a mediocre box office showing upon the film's release just before Christmas.  Yet, the box office intake quadrupled once it hit the international scene, garnering over $360 million.  Instead, I rented the DVD with only the knowledge that my wife and kids refused to watch.  No matter, there are plenty of films they have self banned to include the Harry Potter series, and I had nothing else to watch on a Sunday afternoon while they were at church.     As the plot opens we are thrust into a fantasy world where our characters exist in a parallel universe.  Their souls exist in the form of different kinds of animals called daemons and walk side by side with their human hosts throughout their lives.  The kid's daemons can change shapes into different animals, but by the time they are adults the souls become one kind of animal.  Our main character Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is an orphan who is somewhat of a leader among her peers and challenges her friends, foes, and adults to get to the bottom of a mystery.  Her child friends are being kidnapped by the \\"Gobblers\\" and taken to a far away place in the north.  Her mission is to somehow find them and save them from whatever dark fate awaits them.  At the start of her journey we meet her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) who is trying to prove the existence of \\"dust\\" which he believes exists in a parallel universe and enters a person's body through their daemon.  Lord Asriel obtains funding from the College and proceeds north to prove his theory.  Mean time Lyra his taken away from the college by Mrs. Coulter (Nichol Kidman) under the story of being her assistant.  Lyra is a little wary of her new found supporter and before she leaves the college is given an alethiometer by the master of the college.  The alethiometer, also called the Golden Compass, is an ancient device banned by the Magesterium, the ruling religious party, because it can be used to find the answer to any question as long as the user is skilled in the interpretation of the device.  Confusing yet?  Lyra escapes her would-be supporter and captor and enlists the services of many adults to include the Gyptians, a head witch, a Texan aeronaut (Sam Eliot), and an outcast armored polar bear as she heads north to solve the mystery and rescue her friends.  The pace and sequence of this trek was at a minimum confusing and downright disjointed.  I found myself wondering who edited this thing because the transitions from one plot line to the next were as if something important was left on the cutting room floor.  For example, Lord Asriel is captured by some nasty tribes of the north and for nearly an hour of the flick we don't know his fate.  Then suddenly a narrator says basically he's OK because he bribed his captors....what?  The ending seemed absolutely abrupt, and apparently the original ending was deleted in order to bring it back as the start of a planned sequel.  On the good side however, the special effects were excellent and garnered an Academy Award.  The acting OK and predictable, especially the somewhat type cast antagonist Nichol Kidman and our rustic hero Sam Eliot.  I'm thinking kids could probably follow this better than I and would be thoroughly entertained.  We have a kid hero on a mission of mercy assisted by all her new found friends and she is the only one that can read the Golden Compass to keep everyone on track.  I probably won't be buying this one, but it is certainly worth a watch...that is unless you have religious reservations.
B0015FWRHS|5.0|This album is great! I love a lot about this album from the compositions which have a little classical influence in them to the percussion which was almost never the same between tracks.  The pianist is also great from his runs to improvisation which seemed fresh when he was playing it (I hadn't heard his name before.)  What I love the most about this album though would have to be Avishai's contribution to the tracks his bass playing is so incredible it made me smile because some of it was so ridiculously good.  All in all i think this is a great addition to the modern jazz collection that Avishai is a big part of.  Some of these tracks reminded me of another innovative jazz trio \\"The Bad Plus\\" whom i also love listening to.  I highly recommend this album to any jazz listener or anyone interested in jazz.  PS sorry for my poorly constructed review
B0010ZR160|5.0|Casey Affleck's performance was huge.  Felt like I was right there with him during those life/death decisions as an anti hero.  Of particular note was the first bar scene where Casey's character is interviewing an old class mate about the case and the local hooligan bar patrons decide to start a throw down.  The suspense is immense, especially if like me you view it as the old school yard bully against the little guy with spunk.  I heard myself say \\"YES\\" as my anti-hero pulls out a Glock...sweet, take that you crap head.  My adrenalin was flowing after that exchange, which came as a surprise to me.  I don't usually get so involved in a film that my physical life sign stats peak.  The story line has the typical twists and turns with no moral right or wrong answer throughout.  Our anti-hero simply has to go with his gut and call it based on his experience growing up in the neighborhood.  No matter what his decision there is always a cost that weighs heavily on his soul.  As Gitano said, Ben Affleck's direction was excellent.  After watching the special features I find out why he did so well.  Ben and Casey grew up in this area of Boston and were quite comfortable acting and directing with the real people of the area.  Ben made sure he used the real folks in the movie.  The street dwellers, the cops, even the bar room hooligans were all locals.  They delivered their lines and acted as naturally as they would every day.  This gave the film a realistic quality that you seldom find.    This is one to purchase.  Be warned however, the Southey language is not for the faint at heart.

He abruptly discovers his gift as a high school aged kid (Max Thieriot) escaping death-by-drowning from an icy river.  At first he doesn't believe what happened, but when he escapes the rath of his drunken father in the same manner, he decides it must be real.  This is his ticket out of this broken family (his mother left when he was 5) and this small go-no-where town.  But, a teen ager on the run in New York will have a tough time living without a job.  So, David hones his skills and finances his independence by robbing (jumping) banks.  The story skips forward to find our 25-year old hero, played now by Hayden Christensen (Anikan SkyWalker/Darth Vader in Star Wars II, III), extremely skilled in his jumping ability.  He's now a world wide playboy jumping to multiple countries and playing the field.  Enter our arch enemy the \\"CIA\\" operative Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson) bent on destroying all \\"jumpers\\" on earth and you have the backdrop for any graphic novel.  Throw in David's old high school flame Millie (Rachel Bilson) and an experienced loner \\"jumper\\" Griffin (Jamie Bell), and you have some unwilling team mates set against Roland.  What follows are some 100 jumps in multiple CGI executions covering some \\"20 cities in 14 countries\\" (Wikipedia).  The action is certainly there and the directing for these rapidly moving scenes was fairly tight.  The cinematography was very good and the CGI was woven nicely into the action.  The screen play was a little lacking, so the actors didn't have much to develop or shine, save Sam Jackson who always makes the best of what he's given.  But, at least the film keeps you interested as you're taken for a ride across the globe.  Don't look for any academy awards here, but this one might wet your pallet for a weekend do-you-have-a-movie-where-things-blow-up fix.  The end might leave you wanting the sequel, yet for others it may leave you wanting to know where the return envelop is.  For me, I had fun.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|Christopher Isherwood, the author of THE BERLIN STORIES, where the character Sally Bowles came from in the first place, is quoted in the documentary \\"Chris and Don\\" as saying that Liza Minnelli wasn't right for this movie because she was far too good since Sally Bowles was an amateur performer and there was nothing that resembled an amateur about Minnelli's performance. She gives a performance here that is perfect and deserves to be seen again and again. She comes alive in every scene (her mother would have been proud of her) and won an Oscar for best actress along with Joel Grey (Best Supporting Actor) and Bob Fosse for Best Director. If you are counting, there were five more Oscars awarded to this movie on Oscar night as well. The cinematography is by Geoffrey Unsworth; the music by John Kander and Fred Ebb.<br /><br />Watching this film for the first time since I saw it in 1972, I noticed how much Michael York's character here is similar to the one he played in \\"Something for Everyone,\\" released a few years before \\"Cabaret.\\" Hal Prince, who produced this film was the director of that fine movie and Kander is responsible for the soundtrack.<br /><br />The story of course is all about the \\"divine decadence,\\" as Sally would say, in Berlin in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II. When a young blond angelic German lad sings \\"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\\" and is joined by a whole host of others as the song swells in volume, we get a chilling preview of what will take place soon in Germany and the rest of Europe.<br /><br />\\"Cabaret\\" is quite simply a perfect movie.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|Universal made my day when they finally released this set in the USA a few years ago. Indeed, I count this the most welcome box set from Deutsche Grammophon in the last 10 years!     DG intended to record all of the sonatas with Gilels, but he met with the fate of death before its completion. A little sad indeed, for every minute of the nine CDs in this collection keeps me on the edge of my seat. For years, I thought Pollini was the ultimate in the late sonatas (see [[ASIN:B000001GXB Beethoven: Die Späten Klaviersonaten]]); then I heard Gilels in op. 101 and my jaw dropped. And the same goes for just about every other sonata in this collection when I compared it to my personal \\"reference\\" recording.    But, far and away the grand prize in this set is the Eroica Variations. Brendel's Vox recording (albeit in a trashy Murray Hill LP pressing) got me hooked first back in the mid 1970s. The Arrau release kept me going. And then I bought the Gilels recording in this box (at full price when it was issued in 1982 on CD) and rediscovered the work all over. Gilels plays with a dynamic range I've never found matched for the Eroica Variations, or any other solo piano work for that matter. And the recorded sound is absolutely amazing. Indeed, before the CD age, I recall playing many favorite LPs \\"to death\\", wearing them out with even the finest equipment (which wasn't \\"supposed\\" to happen with reasonably good turntables/styli). When the CD age dawned, every one thought the age of permanence was upon us. Well, I played the Gilels Eroica CD \\"to death\\", far more than with any LP. So much so that the CD truly became \\"worn out\\", and for myself the notion of CD permanence vanished.     Enough said.     Get this at any price. Warning though. You may get hooked and use up all of your vacation time listening to it, or even lose your job. Be prepared.
039472903X|4.0|A solid book that focuses on the basic fundamentals of advertising by one of the most respected \\"admen\\" around. It's spattered with interesting stories and some history of advertising, however it is a bit dated since it was published before the Internet age.     Although it may not be the most contemporary book, it still provides great insight and retrospect into how Ogilvy became the advertising master of his time. Anyone in the ad/creative/pr industry should find this interesting. Just keep in mind that things have evolved since this was first written.
1400034779|2.0|I'm not sure why this book got such raving reviews, I certainly don't need to go on and read book 2 in the series. Perhaps it is because I listened to the audio version, but I found the tone of the writing condescending toward the culture the author is supposed to represent. Moreover, the main character is hardly compelling, and the unfolding events during the story perilously close to being simply boring.
0792843584|1.0|I had a hard time making it through the last half of this DVD even at 128X.  In the \\"film as art\\" world, there is subtle and there is nonexistent.  Heaven's Gate, as anything beyond a monument to it's own excesses, is 4+ hours of nonexistence.    Even given all of this film's glaring missteps, Cimino might still have blundered his way through like he did with The Deer Hunter, but for one fatal stroke - Kris fricking Kristopherson.  What the hell was Cimino thinking?  Were Buck Owens and Roy Clark busy that week?  And who the hell ever told Kris Kristopherson that he could act?  Repeatedly, in the midst of it's soft focus cinematic splendor, we are made to watch Kris Kristopherson mugging at the camera like a minor league ballplayer doing a commercial for a discount carpet outlet.  I'm sorry, but there's just some sh_t I will not eat...
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I bought this Blu-ray the day it came out, ran home and watched it with a smile on my face the entire time. I remember seeing this in the theater when it first came out and this time it feels the same, only better. This Blu-ray version is so much better and more detailed than dvd that it is AMAZING! This is my new favorite hi-def disc and I can't imagine this movie being any better, ever. It is truly amazing to see the amount of detail that was put into this masterpiece. A MUST OWN if there ever was one...I haven't even made it to the special features, yet...but WOW!!!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I have never watched a series this dark, complex and yet a little humorous at the same. It is brilliant to be able to dive into the inner psyche of a serial killer, to try and understand even if but a little, what goes through their cold and twisted minds. Michael C. Hall plays the character to perfection and it is mind boggling how the writers are able to deliver on each and every episode.  I had to pace myself otherwise I would have watched the whole season in one day!  I'm now waiting on the delivery of season2.
0618918248|1.0|All you need to know is: Richard Dawkins knows everything thats possible to know, he dismisses the idea of God, and you better do it, too if you know whats good for you. He especially dislikes the Judeo-Christian God, and walks meekly around the Muslims; they likely wont turn the other cheek to him.<br /><br />When you know it all, there's nothing else to discover. When youre a famous scientist like Richard Dawkins you know and can dismiss every permutation and combination of ways God might occur. You certainly know why there is something rather than nothing in our universe.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|sorry to say goodbye to the series.  i loved all four of the books.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I read about this film and the beautiful music that created the foundation of the plot. I watched the film twice and couldn't get the songs out of my head! I had to buy the soundtrack, and I have really enjoyed the songs, particularly those by Glen. Such talented songwriters, with beautiful harmonies, and so much emotion. If you like folk or singer/songwriter music, you will love this album.
B00005JMCW|5.0|To me, Disney's 2003 version of Freaky Friday is a lot better than the original. I don't hate the original, I just think this one is a lot funnier and more up-to-date! Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan were hilarious trying to be the opposite of each other. After having a big fight with each other on Thursday, Anna (Lohan) and Tess (Curtis) switch bodies on Friday morning, and throughout the entire day, you see hilarious moments as Tess acts like a rebelious teenager and Anna acts more mature. Tess is supposed to be married on Saturday, and if they don't switch back, they'll have to post-pone it. It's also awesome to see Jamie Lee jammin' down at the concert later toward the end of the movie! If you love comedy, you'll love FREAKY FRIDAY!!!<br /><br />p.s. Back in 2003, a cousin and friend of mine helped me make a movie that spoofed this movie and Freddy Vs. Jason. It's Crazy!

0312427999|5.0|Milton Friedman, the diminutive alpha male of the University of Chicago economics department for decades,  called himself a \\"neoliberal.\\" You can be sure his heart wasn't bleeding, however, for civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, abortion rights, or any rights at all except the rights of corporations to operate without government regulation or public scrutiny. None of those liberal causes had any meaning for Friedman or his disciples, who used the word in its 19th C British sense of laissez-faire and free trade. What Naomi Klein and other British journalists call \\"neoliberal\\" is identical with what Americans call \\"neo-conservatism.\\" Milton Friedman was the Apostle Paul of neo-conservatism.<br /><br />Klein describes neo-conservatism as an absolutist sort of ideology - a militant religion of unfettered capitalism, if you will - which is markedly unable to recognize any sense at all in any other religion, and equally unable to admit or learn from mistakes. The central credos of neo-conservatism are: 1) no government regulation of private enterprise, 2) no socialistic government ownership of any enterprise that can possibly be privatized, even police and defense powers, 3) no redistributive taxes; sales taxes being the preferred form if any, 4) withering of the state to what they call, in their own manifestos, a \\"hollow government\\" existing only to collect public revenue and redistribute it to private entrepreneurs, 5) above all, no labor laws, no welfare, no \\"nanny\\" state, no public education, no environmental restrictions!<br /><br />The central thesis of Klein's book is that such neoconservative unfettered capitalism has proven to be incompatible with effective democracy, since no population of voters, given honest information and not subjected to such sort of Shock Therapy, would ever vote or elect representatives to foist something so inimical to the interests upon themselves. Beginning with the historical experiences of the Southern Cone nations - Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil - in the 1970s, Klein shows in great detail how coups and putsches, with their subsequent terror, have been perceived as opportunities for radical economic takeover and restructuring by the Chicago Boys. From Latin America, Klein takes us to Indonesia and South Korea, to South Africa, to Poland, Russia, and eventually to Iraq, depicting the violence, corruption, repression and misery which accompanied every one of those \\"opportunities.\\" In fact, Klein suggests, neoconservative restructuring can ONLY occur in a situation of disaster, whether self-imposed by military traitors, by hyper-inflation cultivated by the IMF and World Bank, or by natural catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />If even half of what Klein reports is accurate, compatriots, we've been sold a bill of sordid goods! Klein is a journalist, not a historian. For that reason, I read her book with caution and resistance, checking her quotes and data whenever I felt the least doubt. Thus it took me weeks to get ready to write this review. For what it's worth, I have found her quotes verifiable in every case, and her data subject only to a few quibbles of omission.<br /><br />Don't suppose that Klein is delivering a party-line polemic. The Clinton Democrats are excoriated equally with the Republicans of the \\"Washington Consensus.\\" NAFTA Bill was at best an impure neoconservative, though for Friedmanites the slightest impurity is anathema. Madeleine Albright was as much a globalizing neo-con as Dick Cheney or Donald Rumsfeld, though a lot less unscrupulous and with far less personal greed at stake. Essentially, since the unregretted collapse of Soviet Communism, neoconservative capitalism has been, as Klein puts it, \\"the only game in town.\\" What Klein achieves in this book, even for those who disagree with her analyses, is to reveal the abuses and the terrible social costs of Friedmanite world dominion.<br /><br />You out there! You who proudly proclaim your conservatism and/or libertarianism! You need to read this book! If you're too smug, or too cowardly, in your convictions, how are you to be taken seriously ever again!read this book! If you're too smug, or too cowardly, in your convictions, how are you to be taken seriously ever again!

1563898586|5.0|It seems that each new read of Alan Moore makes me realize once again that D.C. had no idea what they had in Alan Moore.  To call him pure genius may be the most accurate way of describing his work.  It's not writing -- it's art.  In League, I found myself unable to grasp onto the characters at first -- I expected serious and grim and my mind was demanding that feel.  I had no idea Moore had such a terrific sense of humor.  He's having fun with the material while at the same time evoking the time honored idea \\"there is no good, just shades of evil\\".      In this plot a series of literary characters from the Victorian era pop on the screen.  If you had to read 20,000 Leagues you know of Jules Verne and Captain Nimo.  You might also know of the Invisible Man or Jeckle and Hyde.  In short, we have quite a spicy mixture of characters out to stop a takeover plot.  There are hints of James Bond with characters such as (James, M, and Bond).  We have a reference to Moby Dick and it goes on and on.  Moore spins a tale that on the surface seems racist but what he's really trying to show is that our own racism against others is our glass house since we are selves can be far worse through our own inability to not realize our vial flaws.    I loved the book.  It's a great read.  My only regret was that the main villain was someone far too often used and of course I won't reveal it.  Moore could have been more imaginative but so what -- he's still a genius and I stand by that statement.
B0011Z7KGK|5.0|Ok so it may not be the most intricately developed music to come along, but as far as I am concerned, Chad Kroeger, can sing to me anything, anytime, love his voice...his passion for what he and the band does comes through, from his pairing with Santana to this album. These are the type of songs I can listen to to cheer me up, get me through or just sing along with. To me that is what music is about, how it makes me feel...that's my story and I am sticking to it...<br /><br />One more thing love Michael Kroeger's bass lines, but I would cause I play too ;-)
B001CD6FKI|5.0|I admit, I was skeptical going into this movie, being a huge Speed Racer fan.  I think there are so many incredible things going on in this movie it might be hard for some to really take it all in.    It's a fabulous homage to the series, and just a lot of fun.  The Wachowski's put so many little easter eggs (and by that I mean little treats for fans) in the show: from the car jack sound being the same, to having Speed actually don the original outfit, and hiring a composer who incorporated the original theme into the soundtrack while still making it his own at the same time.  As far as sticking to the spirit of the original series, I think they hit the bullseye.    The Wachowski's are known for trying out new styles of cinematography, and were successful again with Speed Racer.  I loved the editing composition where you've got multiple shots merging together, almost like we're reading the manga (Japanese comic).    I thought the bright colors were great in contributing to the Speed Racer world and making it its own.  The actors did a great job \\"pretending\\" to drive (as the car scenes are done green screen).  It felt like they were really on those tracks doing those impossible stunts Speed Racer is famous for.    The only disappointment I have comes with the DVD and its limited amount of extras.  I guess I just expected more--like a commentary, but it's obviously being able to watch the movie again I'm looking forward to most.  Buy this DVD or at least rent the movie, it will be worth your while.  (I've got a more in-depth review on Speed at deeanimated.wordpress.com)    Your kids will love this DVD.  Not only is it lots of fun, it's one of the few movies out there where you have a family that really sticks together.  For me it's pretty much up in the top three of best films of 2008.  Get it!
B00166QJRU|5.0|This album is an absolute gem. I've never been the biggest Bowie fan, but have always been looking for a good live album from him. This production is increadible from top to bottom. The sound quality is phenomenal with just the right amount of crowd noise and quality vocal/instrumental mixing. Also, the set list cannot be beat. All the quality Bowie tunes including the best tracks that you don't hear every day on your local classic rock radio. Even the classics, with solid guitar solos, jams, and lyrical variations, are a big improvement from the original recordings. Overall, this album is a must have for any classic rock fan regardless of whether or not you're a huge Bowie enthusiast.
B0017MO10U|4.0|Stargate: Continuum is a good movie that brings together all of the SG-1 characters again... This is a funny & poignant movie, full of some surprises, that creates a dramatic to way to more or less tie up some loose ends when the series ended. I enjoyed it.
0930289234|5.0|This is the second graphic novel I've read.  The first was Heroes volume One which advertised Watchmen at the back.

From a newbie's standpoint I'd recommend it.
B000GIW43M|5.0|Mixing allegorical tale of Chinese culture with modern western Californian quirks, Amy Tan's intercontinental/intergenerational tale of four mothers and four daughters is enlightening.<br /><br />The four mothers are from well-to-do families who are displaced from their wealth and country because of the incredibly quick changes of war -- immensely powerful changes through force and might unparalleled by man-to-man or -hand-to-hand.  One woman witnesses her entire family be leveled by a single bomb; another runs away from a life of shame derived from her husband's failure to consummate the marriage; another marries evil who betrays here many times over and leaves with new wings when his death permits her to marry a British soul; and the last leaves China after a horrid life of wealth derived from her mother's ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />As each renews life in the new continent, each remains steadfastly loyal to the old country: the ultimate world for their daughters is to be Chinese true, but offered American opportunities.  The daughters love the latter, defy the former.<br /><br />But, one character is offered a wonderful glimpse of realty - she gets word of her mother's lost daughters being alive. Unfortunately, her mother predeceases the potential family reunion, but daughter and father venture to China where the daughter \\"activates her genes and becomes Chinese.\\"<br /><br />The western writing of the eastern lore is immensely entertaining.  And, sometimes the easterners self-deprecation is excitingly giddy.  One mentions the names of her children: Winston, Vincent and Waverly.  Winston is derived from phonetic concepts \\"wins\\" \\"ton\\" = wins many things.  Vincent is derived from \\"win\\"\\"Cent\\" = money earner.  And, Waverly . .. Well it was the name fo the street where they lived when she was born.<br /><br />This was a great bonding book.  It is cute and very sad.  It is mature and very childlike. It is a wonderful novel.
0123694965|4.0|The Art of Game Design is simple in its language yet intriguing in its concepts. Jesse's well written book is equivalent to a four year undergrad degree in the same subject. The bulkiness of the book might seem overwhelming, but once you start reading, you delve right into it without you even knowing it.    The book draws inspiration from a myriad of topics and fields and definitely provides life lessons on a deeper level. The philosophy and its understanding helps in knowing yourself better, first as a person and then as a designer.     The Art of Game Design will inculcate a positive design perspective to the way you observe everyday things and events. Even if you are not a designer, it certainly is an excellent addition to collectibles that broaden your horizon. A must-buy for those aspiring to be a designer.

B00005JPO1|1.0|Horrible movie.  I can't express how much I disliked this movie.  I've never left a movie feeling really angry, this one I did.  It had a lot of promise, but it was just horrible.  The story and script were terrible (aliens?  Definitely killed this franchise).  I feel bad that such a caliber actress like Cate Blanchett has a film like this on her resume.  Shia LaBeouf is an over-rated actor who was a bore to watch on the screen.  Harrison Ford just came off as an aging actor trying to hold on to his glory days.  Time to move on from Indiana.  While the older films were great, this one was nothing but a let down and it just goes to show that it's sometimes best to let things stay in the past where they belong.  I guess since Steven Spielberg and George Lucas knew that they had an audience that would come to the movie regardless of what the story is they decided to just make a film with a flimsy script and add in a horrible character (LaBeouf).

B001BKXUOQ|4.0|Slipknot's self titled album and second album, Iowa, were unrelentingly angry and heavy albums.  The latter being Slipknot's heaviest album.  Corey Taylor then went on to reform his previous band, Stone Sour, which showcased more of his melodic singing voice (which was previously presented only in small amounts on songs such as Wait and Bleed and Left Behind).  When Taylor finally made the next album with Slipknot, Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses, it was evident he had decided to incorporate his more melodic elements into Slipknot as well.  This resulted in a much less heavy Slipknot.  The band had also gone from angry, profanity laden lyrics to their first album (not counting Mate Feed Kill Repeat) to not feature a parental advisory or any profanity.  This left fans of the first two albums disappointed and confused.  Was the band who made songs such as Surfacing and Disasterpiece gone forever?  Well, not entirely.  All Hope is Gone brings back the heavier sound of Iowa, while still retaining some of the melodic elements of Volume 3.  It also brings back the profanity and parental advisory ;)  While it is not the self titled album or Iowa, it is a step in the right direction, and is much better than Volume 3.  Part of the problem with Volume 3 was not incorporating melodic parts, but that the melodic parts were not that good.  The heavier parts were also not as heavy.  All Hope is Gone takes what Volume 3 did and does it better, and also brings back the old sound.  It is the album that Volume 3 should have been.  If you hated Volume 3, this album is almost good enough to forget it ever happened.  If you liked Volume 3, it has enough of that sound to please you as well.  I believe it has enough of both sounds to please fans of both pre and post Volume 3 era Slipknot.

031606792X|5.0|I just loved Breaking Dawn and think it is the perfect ending for this series.  I am in my mid forties and was able to thoroughly enjoy this fantasy world.  I loved the entire book (and series).  I know that some people have complained that the book ended the series too perfectly, but I like that it ended this way.  My brother has terminal cancer, and it was a relief for me to be able to escape to an exciting world where there are happy endings.  Thank you Stephenie Meyers for writing this series.  I couldn't put the books down!
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|I'd heard about Adele and how her style was soulful and bluesy, and was not disappointed with this album.  She has a really unique, deep and low voice that really goes with her style - I can just picture her in a smoky hall, burning up the stage.  I didn't like all of the songs on the album (some are a little too slow for my taste), but there are several real gems ( \\"Right as Rain\\" is upbeat and cheeky fun).  I'm enjoying this influx of neo-soul/blues from across the Pond, and I totally recommend this album.
031606792X|1.0|Wow, this book was terrible! I picked up the Twilight series a week ago and was immediately hooked by the first one. And I really don't mean this as a compliment. It was a delicious read in the way that eating 16 pieces of bacon for breakfast might be. So tasty I can't...stop....reading...but there is no nutritional substance to the bacon.  I mean book. Bella Swan (TERRIBLE protagonist name) is one of the flattest characters ever created, with the sole exception of her vampire boyfriend Edward. She's pretty but doesn't realize it, he's mind-blowingly good looking and talented, yet obnoxiously noble and self sacrificing. They fall in love for no real reason, they can't live without each other, blah blah blah. Cue the 3 sequels, drama, resolutions that are easy and painless, and the happy ending. Being the task oriented person that I am, I had to finish the series, but if you are not unable to call something quits, do yourself a favor and stop after book 1. (Book 1 was, after all, a pretty fun read). If you  are incapable of doing this (bacon IS hard to say no to once you smell it) prepare yourself for an endless flow of these words: \\"Bella grimaced, Edward chuckled, Bella, Edward, and all other characters rolled their eyes, Bella snorted, Edward clenched his jaw....\\" I could go on. Very unimaginative descriptions abound. Take out the words chuckled, grimaced, and rolled her/his eyes and you would have a much shorter series. And prepare yourself for climaxes that are very easily resolved once the misunderstandings are put straight (like a Three's Company episode, only much, much more drawn out). No one important dies. No tough choices are made by the main characters. Everything works out perfectly for Bella all the time. And the worst part is, you KNOW that's what kind of an author Stephanie Meyer is, but you just....can't.....stop....reading. Mmmmmmmmmm, baaaaaconnnnnn.
0671027573|4.0|If you enjoyed \\"To Die For\\", LH's most light-hearted and sweetly hilarious novel ever, you will probably enjoy \\"Mr. Perfect\\".  Jaine and her cop have much the same snappy/sexy dynamic that  Blair and Lt. Bloodsworth have.  The bantering is fun, and there is a lot of action (almost too much if you are looking for something that's thriller-lite or fluff).     Or as my mum, romance addict extraordinaire, put it, \\"It's almost as good as the 'Blair-book'\\".
0618918248|1.0|This book is full of lies from the devil himself. The only truth is in the bible.  The bible is 1/3 prophecy from God.  Read it for yourself.

0767903862|5.0|I read this book on the way to Sydney a couple of years ago at the beginning of a project assignment which called for me to spend about six weeks there.  I enjoyed the author's writing style much more than a typical travel book.  However, despite the light tone and the many humorous anecdotes, I found that Mr. Bryson really did effectively capture a \\"feel\\" for the culture.  Time and again, as I interacted with the people while working with them, I was reminded of a passage in the book.  I beleive that reading the book helped me relate to the people more easily.  Highly recommended.

Oldman and Hopkins play it over the top (not like Waits however) as they should have, every one else were just sort of... eh?<br /><br />I like it, but honestly only bought it to fill in my collection of vampire movies.
B000009HF2|5.0|I love it now just as I loved it then.  Sounds great and the price was right!

B001AQO3WY|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!! I CAN SAY BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT. THIS IS THE MOST ACCURATE SERIES OF IRAQ I'VE EVER SEEN. THERE EVERYDAY PROBLEMS ARE STILL FELT TODAY. I HAVE JUST RETURNED HOME AND HEARD ABOUT THIS SHOW FROM A FRIEND. NOW 16 OF MY FRIENDS SEE WHAT WE WENT THREW DRIVING CONVOYS UP AND DOWN IRAQ.

B0017MO10U|5.0|Makes me long for the old days of Jack, Daniel, Sam, and Teal'c. This is a great movie, just not long enough, but that could be just because I'm not sure if there is going to be another one. A must have for any SG-1 fan
B000T9OP7G|5.0|This TV series follows the adventures of Sarah Conner and her son John after the end of the Terminator 2 movie. I was quite surprised at how good the series is. It follows the terminator theme quite well and has plenty of action. The actors do a great job, especially Summer Grau who does an excellent female terminator. The story lines are interesting and the show moves along at a fairly steady pace. I just hope it doesn't become too much of a government conspiracy movie instead of a good action packed sci-fi series. The DVD is excellent with great picture and sound and plenty of extra features. If you are a sci-fi buff in general or a Terminator fan specifically then you will enjoy this series. I look forward to the new season.
B0017XFBMG|5.0|For fans of the Pogues this is a no brainer, packed with previously unreleased material that will satisfy years of craving more from the band. Some below have complained that the set contains too much filler. For me this is like manna from heaven- great new tunes, several interesting covers (Do you believe in magic ) and good instrumentals.  Well worth the wait.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|When I had first heard of a new slipknot cd, i was super hyped. I have been listening to them from Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat. (For those who do not know what that is, look is the f*@% up) There are only two tracks that I really did not like, one being the title track. The rest of the cd is a great musical trip with the nine. Then with the special edition you get bonus tracks, which is more then worth the few extra bucks. The remix tghey have on the cd makes a good song great.     Over all, picking up where they left off, they did a great job and this cd will be in my player till the next slipknot cd comes out. Maggot For Love. MMFCL
B0006L16N8|3.0|This CD is my first exposure to Coldplay and I am at a loss as to why all the fuss over this band. Then again if you enjoy mainstream, commercial music this is for you.<br /><br />Soon after inserting the disc into my player I removed it to thinking I had selected a U2 disc in error. No error had been made on my part.<br /><br />The same vocals, the same maddening I feel like marching drum beat, the same simpleton bass lines, the same lack of substance on the guitar. Plain and simple, a ripoff of a commercially successful band from the past.
0765342294|5.0|I kept seeing Ender's Game recommended by others but it seemed like a young adult type book so I moved on several times.  I finally couldn't ignore the shear number of 5 star ratings for this book.  It lived up to it.  I devoured the book in a few days (fast for me.)  I was surprised to find that I actually took some things away from this book that I used in dealing with people who work for me.  What a fantastic story.  Left me wanting more.  I have already purchased \\"Ender's Shadow\\" and \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" - you will love what that means by the way - and can't wait to read them as well.  The basic story line is aliens have attacked the Earth twice and nearly decimated the human race.  The last time they attacked was about 80-100 years ago.  In the meantime, humans have devised a way to identify and train a \\"super leader\\" to save us the next time the aliens attack.  Ender is six years old when he is identified as a potential candidate.  He is sent to battle school to learn to lead and fight, etc.  He is basically pushed to his limits because he is our last hope.  That's all I will tell you.  The pay off was worth it for me.  Enjoy!
B00005JPS8|2.0|It has quite a few funny dialogues. The plot has depth. It shows the weaknesses of Ironman. For example, he recovered from alcohol addiction. It makes him more human. The special effects are so-so. It's worth seeing once.
B000W1W9D8|5.0|This album is so good it should be mandatory listening before any young punk even thinks about playing guitar.    Great songs, great recording, even greater artist.    Buy it, play it and share it with folks who think rock and roll started with Elvis...
B0013SQP66|5.0|Though not every episode of Breaking bad has been \\"exciting\\" in the traditional sense, it has been entertaining. Breaking Bad sort of reminds me of \\"Fargo\\" for some reason; not exactly a fast paced show, but a lot of stuff happens.     The show is about a chemistry teacher who starts dealing meth, although the show sort of has an anti-drug undertone. The story is pretty compelling, and if they don't make it really stupid and over the top next season, I will keep watching.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|After the breakup rumors which surrounded the band while touring in support of Vol. 3, people assumed that Slipknot were finished. Wasn't that the assumption after Iowa? People tried to write them off, and they failed. Here they are 4 years later with a new album, All Hope Is Gone. Produced by Dave Fortman (Evanescence, Mudvayne), and mixed by Colin Richardson (Machine Head, Trivium, Chimaira), the album features a lot of melodies like on Vol. 3, but it also manages to retain the heaviness of Iowa. If you felt that Vol. 3 was more of a Stone Sour record than a Slipknot record, you shouldn't be turned off by this. Comparing Slipknot and Stone Sour is like comparing apples and oranges. They may feature two of the same members, but they play different music. Remember, this is Slipknot. It's hard to confuse the two bands.    The special edition is worthy if you feel like shelling out a few extra bucks. It's basically a cd/dvd set housed in a nice big digipak. Careful when you open it up, there is no compartment to keep the booklet in. It'll fall right out. From what I understand, the booklet contains expanded artwork. It's a thick booklet, trust me. Pictures aplenty. You get three bonus tracks: 1 song leftover from the All Hope Is Gone sessions, a remix for Vermilion pt. 2, and a previously unreleased track called Til We Die. The DVD is something to watch. Expect it to be a continuation of Voliminal as it was filmed by Shawn Crahan, and it's in that style, however, you actually get some nice footage of the band in the studio. Band members faces are visible instead of blurred out, but it's not like there's any mystery as to what they look like especially if you've seen the interviews on the Voliminal dvd.     No question about it, Slipknot is back. Bring on the chaos.
B001B71NOI|5.0|An impressive album by Nine Inch Nails! I was blown away by Trent's decision to allow everyone to download the whole album for free. It's really impressive to see him embracing technology and the way it's changing the music industry instead of trying to fight it. I have been a Nine Inch Nails fan for close to 15 years now and because of his consideration of his fans by releasing this album for free to us, I decided to purchase the physical CD of the Slip to show my support. So I encourage everyone: be a good fan and support the artist, especially since this artist is trying to help his own fans!
B00125WAWS|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that you will love. very great and positive and teaches one to work hard and the shy is the limit and once you believes that God is the judge and the opponent doesn't exist you will win. Challenges will arise but with hard work you can reach for the skies. Excellent movie Denzil Washington.
1843106698|5.0|When our 9-year-old son was referred to a specialist to assess for Asperger's Syndrome, I wanted to get my hands on as much information as possible!  The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome is just that: complete!  It has been an amazing resource to open our understanding of this neurological disorder.  I went to our son's assessment feeling confident and able to communicate with the specialist.  The book helped me understand my son in many areas that I had no idea would fall under Asperger's Syndrome.  When the initial referral was made, I felt like my feet had been knocked out from under me.  When the diagnosis was made, however, I felt much more sure footed because of the knowlege and tools I learned in Tony Attwood's book.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I originally watch the special on HBO, and I wanted to watch it again.  I was very happy that you offered the mini series.  I have watched it again, and passed it along to friends who have not had the pleasure of watching the original mini series.  thank you for offering this special.

B00005JKLZ|2.0|This is a remake of a pretty good 1960 film version of the H G Wells story. Guy Pierce stars in the leading role. Now Guy Pierce isn't a bad actor, but here is given an impossible job. At the start of the film he is the obsessed Prof. Hartdegen who just happens to on the verge of building a time machine. He has a sweetheart of course and after an evening in the park he has recourse to use the machine. From then on its downhill all the way as Hartdegen changes from a somewhat reclusive Prof. into an Indiana Jones type character.<br /><br />Add to this magical transformation a frequently vomit-making musical soundtrack and overall you have a film that really should only be watched if you have nothing better to do. There are worse films for sure, but this certainly lacks any of the charm of the original and has even less to with the book. Result - only buy if they are giving it away!
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|I was really happy about my cd purchase. My cd arrived just as described. It also arrived earylier then expected. thanks for the cd and an awesome low cost and speedy delivery.

0385338910|5.0|i not just read this book and enjoyed it thoroughly but have loaned it out to a few of my friends.  they also gave it an outstanding review.  this author has a wonderful way of developing his characters and putting the story together.
1416550518|3.0|\\"The House at Riverton\\" begins with Grace Bradley, now 98 years old narrating the story of her life in service to the Ashbury family at the English country estate at Riverton.<br /><br />In 1914, at age 14, Grace worked as a housemaid at Riverton Manor, and the book unfolds through flashbacks and the memories of the events that took place.<br /><br />The premise is an interesting one. Servants are so often privvy to secrets, and this is true in Grace's case.<br /><br />Some reviewers comment about the 'upstairs/downstairs' aspect of the novel, and I can certainly see that. But it's all been 'done' much better. For me, the novel did not hold a great appeal. The plot never 'grabbed' me, but I am not a romantic at heart. While the Edwardian era is a fascination, the novel's focus left me cold. Perhaps I am just not into the devoted servant thing.
0064430227|5.0|My sister resently bought this book for my 3 year old son & once we started to read it I remoembered it from when I was a little girl.  My son absolutly LOVES IT & I do as well.

0743277465|5.0|Josh Waitzkin is absolutely incredible.  He has done so much at such a young age.  My wife (Jane) and my two children (Cranny and Keet) went to the 25th anniversary conference of SENG (Supporting Emotional Needs of the Gifted)([...]) .  Josh spoke at this conference about how he has achieved the success he has achieved in both chess and martial arts.  It was clear that his intellectual abilities are exceptional and he is capable of learning to skills quite quickly.  The one thing I learned more than anything is that when one learns a new skill, it is important to take a part of that skill and master it.  Once the part of the skill is mastered, the rest of the skill becomes that much easier to master.  Many of us when we are learning new skills try to do too much at one time.  This one piece of advice has helped me immensely.  It has also helped me give advice to others including my children and clients.  Josh's book outlines his journey towards the mastery of his passions.  It is quite an amazing read and will be an inspiration to us all.  I highly recommend telling Josh's story to your children or to the children you work with.      Steven E.

0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein has written a vitally important book for anyone who wants to understand recent US history - it gets behind the clutter of propaganda and the hot air of government briefings to reveal the important thrust of US policy at home and abroad - she deserves a pulitzer for this!
0307265730|3.0|A beautifully (as usual) written book by Ms Lahiri -- but oh so very depressing...  Every story in this collection deals with death, dying, suicide, love relationships gone bad, etc. etc. I persevered to the end, thinking that the pattern would be broken, but it never was.  Don't read this when you're in a \\"down\\" part of your life.
031606792X|5.0|I was worried about what I was going to think of this book, based on the many negative reviews it got. I am a huge Twilight fan and didn't want to be disappointed. I WASN'T!!! I loved this book. Yes, it is different than the others, but it kind of had to be. I love the way she wrote it in 3 different \\"books\\". I love that there were different perspectives to it. The \\"before\\" Bella, Jacob and the \\"after\\" Bella.       I am a 30 year old Disney girl at heart and I am All about the happy endings! I would be so much more disappointed if it was not that way. I have fallen to much in love with all these characters to not think about them in eternal happiness. I thank you Stephanie Meyer again for bringing me to an alternate reality for a little while! I will miss it so much and will read all of them over and over again to bring me back there. I am in a bit of book depression being that I have immersed myself into these books for the past few weeks. One right after another. I hope and PLEAD with her to write Midnight Sun as fast as possible so we can be a part of this world again, but from Edwards point of view!!
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Great music.  I bought this CD after I bought Cease to Begin by the same artist.  The two CDs by Band of Horses have been a regular in my CD player ever since.  I highly recommend Band of Horses.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I love the show so much. But this DVD set disappointed me! The package looks very new but once I opened it, finger prints and scratches on the discs were already there. The major problem is - only 18 discs out of the 40 discs in the box are 100% playable. I have returned the 1st set and now testing the 2nd set, seems the very same problem are still there. For all the Friends Fans: Don't buy it!
B0018BDAMK|5.0|Simply Red has had a career of inventive, original high quality music under the supervision of highly gifted lead vocalist Mick Hucknall - a truly gifted jazz and blues singer.  Sadly they have said no new music is to come.  So we are given the gift of these collector's editions of their best works.  After a huge success with their first album PICTURE BOOK they had a lull with their second.  Then came this, A NEW FLAME and Simply Red came back to life.  What an amazing set which provided the group the ability to showcase all their assets.  Their music is truly original which is rare.  Mick Hucknall takes a song and wraps his emotive vocals tenderly around the lyrics.  He can swoon, he can jam, he can do it all.<br /><br />Hits here are IF YOU DON'T KNOW ME BY NOW, IT'S ONLY LOVE and A NEW FLAME.  There is no filler on this cd.  All the songs are great.  Other standouts are YOU'VE GOT IT and ENOUGH.  This cd is digitally remastered and provides amazing sound quality.  There are also 5 essential bonus tracks included.<br /><br />As with all the collector's editions there is the great added addition of a dvd and here we have Simply Red filmed live in Manchester, England in 1990.  It is an amazing set of 13 songs and again, the video and audio are superb.<br /><br />Simply Red has had longevity but has also been very underrated.  These editions show how great thet were and are and the stamp they have put on the history of music.  Definite quality jazz/r@b here and a highly recommended must have.
B001BKXUOQ|2.0|This was a difficult album to digest. Like many fans i was excited by Psychosocial and the positive reviews the album was receiving. Unfortunately upon hearing the album i feel incredibly disappointed. There is very little here that adds anythig to Slipknot's growing portfolio of songs. Vol 3 was a great album and possibly their best. Iowa and the self titled were equally. What all those albums had in common was direction, attitude and memorable songs. Most importantly they pushed Slipknot to the next level and brought a new instensity to their music. Unfortunately All Hope Is Gone (AHIG) is a just a contrived mess and feels rushed and underprepared which place it at a disadvantage because the album doesn't know what it wants to be.    Psychosocial, which was such an exciting song, sounds really retarded on the album because of the addition of the parts that were edited out for the radio. Gehenna find Corey singing with some stupid falsetto and just makes you want to puke. He is a good singer but nt that good. Tracks 7-10 just feel confused and a mish mash of noise. The best part of the album is easily found with tracks 2-6. The only problem is that its been done before. Its like thye just used leftover material from Stone Sour and sessions from their other albums. Vendetta for example wants to be this album's Pulse of the Maggots. Sulfur is literally a Stone Sour song and the same goes for Dead Memories. Gematria and Snuff are probably the 2 best tracks on the album because they reflect the best of Slipknot's abulity to change things up with great results. Furthermore i would say that you should save your money and stick with the basic edition because the bonus tracks are atrociuiosly bad.    In closing i don;t understand what Slipknot wanted to do here. Yes i have read all the stupid press interviews where they want to mix up all the albums and give the world something they are not prepared for. All that is just talk. Theres no excitement here. I'm not someone whocares whther a band sells out or crap like that. I just want good music and this is not it. Perhaps they should have stayed with Rick Rubin instead of Dave Fortman because personally i think the latter sucks something serious.Finally I think Slipknot should stop trying to sound brutal with every album and trying to prove a point to the metal loving naysayers and be themselves.When they are able to do that they produce quality material resembling their work with their previous albums. Basically you're not missing anything here. Just preview and buy the songs you like because the album itself is just a waste of time.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|Gilmore Girls was one of the best shows that has ever aired.  The mix of drama and humor was perfectly crafted.  The acting was stellar and all relationships were real and believable.  Especially Lorelai and Rory of course.<br /><br />Season 7 is a mixed bag - a very disappointing way for true Gilmore fans to say good-bye.  The season 5 ender with the infamous \\"Will You Marry Me?\\" was ideal Gilmore at its best.<br /><br />Sadly, the creators of Gilmore Girls, Amy SP and family, seemed to have not felt the Gilmore love as much as the Gilmore dedicated fans did.<br />Many felt that the show should have ended with Lorelai and Luke together.  I loved them as a couple in season 5 as much as anyone but I would have been ok if they did part if the 6th and 7th season were as well written and up to par as all the previous superior Gilmore seasons.  One must remember that the trauma with Luke and Lorelai and the introduction of April was by Ms. Amy so things started to go wrong even with the original creative crew.  (I have always been a believer that when an addition that doesn't make sense occurs like the famous cousin on The Brady Bunch disaster is near.)  And that is what happened here.<br /><br />Season 7 could have evolved with exploring each character's journey and been of the highest caliber if it was realistic.  Lorelai marrying Christopher was not written in a way that made any sense.<br /><br />But I must move on to the positive and that is that subpar Gilmore is better than no Gilmore at all.  The excellent acting continued in season 7 and never has an ensemble clicked so well.  One of the greatest mistakes with Gilmore Girls was that the gifted Lauren Graham never received an Emmy let alone a nomination.  Her portrayal of Lorelai was filled with so many layers and dimensions it is truly one of the greatest characters ever.  Though the ensemble cast was so excellent she always held the show on her shoulders.  And she carries season 7 and manages to make silly plots and things that just didn't make sense seem more than real.  Lorelai was as real as ever and Lauren Graham saved the day.  She definitely got to use her acting chops in this season.<br /><br />If you are a true Gilmore fan as I am you must have this season - the set must be complete.  And watch season 7 to find joy and pleasure where you can.  The last half of the season hits its stride and the series did manage to end on a high note.<br /><br />I will always miss Gilmore Girls and it will always have a special place in my heart and soul.  It managed to become a part of me as all the real activities that happened in the fictitous town of Stars Hollow were exppertly written and acted.  This is a television classic and my dvds will never get dusty.<br /><br />Thanks for 7 seasons of pleasure and love.sense seem more than real.

031606792X|5.0|I have been totally spellbound by this series and once emersed into the fantastic story of Bella and Edward, I couldn't tear myself away from the enfolding story, including the events in \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" I would say \\"stop whining\\" to those complaining about this totally happy ending. Real life is full of tragedies and Bella has had more than her share. She deserved a happily-ever-after \\"everafter\\" and so do the readers of this saga. If you want to read about ongoing struggles, sadness and the painful realities of the human condition, there are plenty of books out there to fill this need. For a few brief shining hours, each day, while reading Stephanie Meyer's prose, I found myself putting aside deadlines and problems and falling into the spell these stories have cast on so many readers of all ages. And no...I am not a teen...I am a 57-year-old higher-education executive who hopes Stephanie will give us more of the life of Edward, Bella, Renesmee and the rest of the Cullen family. BRAVO!
0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson has written so many hilarious books that it's hard to say which is the funniest, but when I meet someone who is new to Bryson's work, again and again I find myself recommending this one.    The one-liners (\\"Italians park as if they've just spilled a beaker of hydrocloric acid in their laps\\") are funny no matter how well-travelled (or non-travelled) you are, and the prose is so descriptive and wonderful that you learn as you go along.    As far as I'm concerned Bill Bryson is the finest non-fiction writer of our time.
0784011710|5.0|I think that `Sophie's Choice' is not a film you can enjoy the first go around.  No, I think it takes at least two viewings before you can behold all that the film really represents.  It's kind of like `Million Dollar Baby', another film that doesn't really make an impression until the second viewing.  The reason for this is that you aren't really sure what all the fuss is about until the final moments of the film.  Both films seem like average movie going experiences until the emotionally crippling finales that open your eyes to a whole new way of viewing the film.  The second time around you are able to appreciate so much more because you know exactly what kind of film you're watching.<br /><br />The film follows a young aspiring writer nicknamed Stingo who moves into a boarding house in Brooklyn where he shares occupancy with a young and beautiful Polish immigrant named Sophie.  Sophie herself is nice enough, but her boyfriend Nathan is another story, one moment kind and affectionate and the next moment thrown into a jealous and unjustified rage.<br /><br />The film feels as though it is nothing more than a film of friendship and restrained affection (especially between Stingo and Sophie) and moves along as if the film is more concerned with Nathan and his effect of those around him than anything else; but as the film progresses towards the halfway mark the focus shifts and we realize that Sophie has a past so dark and horrible one can't help but be engrossed in it.  In fact, the best scenes of the film appear in gritty black and white and are spoken in German as Sophie recounts her life before Brooklyn.<br /><br />The acting in this film has been lauded, especially with regards to Meryl Streep, and that Oscar was more than earned (she donned a perfect Polish accent and learned to speak German for the role) but Meryl was not the only one pulling her weight.  Kevin Kline, who made his big screen debut with this film, does a good job with depicting his characters emotional state.  He comes off a little over-the-top and obnoxious until his character is fully explained, and then everything starts to fall into place.

076535618X|5.0|This is third installment of the \\"Old Man's War\\" trilogy.  John, Jane, Zoe (along with her two Obin nannies and protectors), leave for a new planet to colonize.  But they end up at a different planet than what they were expecting.  They find themselves as pawns in a diplomatic war between the human Colonial Union and the alien Conclave led by General Gau, who is an honorable being.  They wind up as \\"victors\\" over both groups by thinking out of the box.  This was supposed to be the last book in this universe, but \\"Zoe's Tale\\" should be out now in hardback.
B00188KD1Y|2.0|Explosively loud and expectedly crazy, 2008's Death Race bears the distinct marks of director Paul W.S. Anderson's trademark fast action and brutal violence, but a heavy focus on visuals can't overcome an extremely predictable storyline - one that unfortunately loses most of the magic of Corman's original. While an interesting commentary on America's infatuation with violence lies buried beneath all the metal and mayhem, what's clearly exposed is a less interactive, R-rated Mario Kart for adults.<br /><br />The year 2012 finds the United States' economy collapsed, unemployment off the charts, and prisons filled to capacity. Greedy corporations control the system and stage live competitions to the death for entertainment. In the ever-present bid for more riotously violent spectacles, notorious female warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) creates Death Race, a three-part car-race for freedom where the only rule is to stay alive. When Frankenstein, the most infamous Death Race combatant, dies shortly after a race, Hennessey frames driver Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) for murder and blackmails him into participating in the latest deathmatch under the guise of the deceased racer. Realizing he's trapped, Ames agrees to race, but with the help of his dedicated crew of mechanics and his navigator Case (Natalie Martinez), he might just be able to find a way out - and exact a little revenge on those who wronged him.<br /><br />Jason Statham seems to be the go-to guy for silly action movies, and while he's certainly not as charismatic as some of his action-movie predecessors, he does get the job done. In Death Race he's appropriately stone-faced and serious, and with a touch of camaraderie and even a little humor, he creates an antihero that's easy to root for. Which is good because there's little else to cheer for other than the violent and over-the-top death sequences. Ames' competition is littered with stereotypes of very angry men fueled by hatred and a general distaste for life. Tyrese Gibson portrays a noticeably unintimidating antagonist, one whose menace is relegated to mediocre taunts and whose sexuality seems to be constantly under question. All the rest are merely obstacles, as lifeless as the bullets and juggernaut tanks that hinder our hero's progress. Except for Joan Allen's Hennessey, who is so annoyingly cocky and overwrought with forced aggression that to see her get what's coming to her is barely compensation for her copious screentime.<br /><br />The very idea of a B-movie has been dragged out of Death Race and fattened up - to the point that it is anything but second grade material. Convincing special effects, high definition detonations, and top quality set designs are but a few of the aspects that are too good to be bad. Unlike the original film, which rose from its low-budget status to become a cult classic (chiefly due to its unusually fun themes of anarchy and nihilism), this new Death Race tries too hard to go for specific audience reactions. While director Paul W.S. Anderson force-feeds us the moments that he wants to be perceived as ultra hip, the more entertaining subtleties are likely to be ignored. As we're tantalized by the shapely Natalie Martinez swaying in slow motion, an interesting stolen idea from The Shawshank Redemption might be overlooked. Then again, maybe we're better off.<br /><br />Like some twisted hybrid reality TV show abomination of BattleBots, The Fast and the Furious and The Shawshank Redemption, the new Death Race is unspeakably cheesy. But crowned with Roger Corman's own producer credit, it is perhaps appropriately nonsensical. Begging to be the ultimate \\"guy movie\\" with slow-motion scantily-clad girls, violent bloody action, explosions, heavy artillery and fast armored cars, it is also itching to be ridiculed. From hilariously peaked dialogue to the safety warning at the end credits (asking the easily impressionable to refrain from stunt car driving), Death Race can't and shouldn't be taken seriously.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins
B000005IZ8|5.0|Of three Qatsi movies, my favorite is certainly, Powaqqatsi because it is not just a gorgeous movie with amazing images; it is one of very precious experiences that happen rarely in life. What made this experience possible is above all and without doubt the MUSIC. It was not the first music by Philip Glass I heard. I like his minimalistic and somehow disturbing scores that go right to your senses for \\"The Hours\\", \\"Notes of the Scandal\\", and \\"The Illusionist\\" (2006). Powaqqatsi was the second movie in Reggio's \\"Qatsi\\" trilogy for me. Just before it, I saw \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" (1982) or Life out of Balance\\", the first of three Reggio-Glass movies. I like \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" very much but I think it is the images that make it so memorable. \\"Powaqqatsi\\" for me, is about Glass's magnificent, un-earthy, divine and literally uplifting and transcending score. It is the music that could've been played after God had finished his work of creation and looked down at Earth and saw that it was good. I am a music lover, and I love music of different genres, epochs, and cultures. I enjoy listening to Mozart and Beatles, Nino Rota and Metallica, Zamphir and Scott Joplin, Bob Dylan and Lucianno Pavarotti, Bach and Edith Piaf. I love them all but I don't recall ever being so moved and taken out of this reality, feeling happy and overwhelmed, proud to be able to witness and enjoy the incredible achievement of human creativity and genius as when I was watching and listening to three \\"Anthems\\" and \\"Mosque and Temple\\" scenes of \\"Powwaqatsi: Life in Transformation\\". I keep listening to my favorite tracks over and over again, and the music has the same impact at me making tears of joy coming to my eyes every time I hear the majestic hypnotic triumphant sounds of music written by Phillip Glass.
B000055Y0Y|3.0|I won't deny that parts of this film work, very well at that, but in the end `In the Line of Fire' comes off rather generic, without much differentiating it from the masses of similar films shoveled out to us on a regular basis.  The acting is decent at best, at time even horrid, and the scripting (which is really the films saving grace) tends to fall into clich&eacute;d territory more often than not.  Sure, it is exciting and in parts is delivers just what we're looking for, but to be honest there are many other films that hit their mark much greater than this one.<br /><br />The film pits Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan against the evil Mitch Leary in a game of cat and smarter cat as Leary taunts Horrigan with his plans to take out the President of the United States.  Horrigan is haunted by memories of his days with President Kennedy and blames himself for Kennedy's death, so Leary plays off of these fears in order to drive Horrigan to the brink of insanity, causing him to lose the respect and trust of the men and women around him.<br /><br />Is Horrigan willing to take a bullet for the President?<br /><br />The film gradually builds to the dramatic conclusion that actually ruins the film for me.  I actually enjoyed the vocal toying of Leary to Horrigan, but when the two finally come face to face the film feels as if it gets derailed.  I think this is largely due to the fact that Malkovich starts to overact (drastically) and his menacing mannerisms come off cheesy and overdone.  I usually like him, but this was a messy performance.  Until this scene he does a decent job of delivering the underlying menace in his characters eyes, but here he just goes out there and the result is less than impressive (seriously, Oscar nomination?).<br /><br />The acting is decent, like I said.  Clint is effective for the most part but his gruff demeanor tends to take away from the emotional pain burrowing beneath his surface.  I don't see a reason for Rene Russo's character to exist.  She was the worst part of the script (total clich&eacute;) and her performance is far less than becoming.  Dylan McDermott has a nice part in the beginning; too bad he was used to little.<br /><br />In the end `In the Line of Fire' is not a `bad' film, but it is not a great one either.  It will suffice if you want a decent thriller than entertains for the most part, but it is not very original, the character development is mediocre and the acting is sub par.  In other words; you can do much better than this so you might as well look elsewhere.cript (total cliché) and her performance is far less than becoming.

B001BGTWXI|5.0|I've only listened once to this CD but I love it.  C'mon, folks...Slipknot doesn't have to be growly and harsh to still be brutal.  Corey's vocals are top form.  He evokes so much emotion, and without screaming.  This is a good thing, kiddies.  Not to say that there's not screaming, but there seems to be less than other albums.  I am a big fan of Subliminal Verses, and this seems to be another step in that direction. Deep insights and social commentary are what you get with this album.  Good work boys!
B00000AFHM|3.0|3 1/2    The album begins like a classic, displaying Belle's signature mellow folk-pop orchestrations at their best- where beautiful intertwined melodies and a hushed acoustic urgency effortlessly combine. Their \\"Sleep The Clock Around\\" is probably the best rendition I have heard of one of the most cliched chord phrasings used in modern rock, and everything feels spot on until the sixth track or so, which is when things begin to sharply decline, never fully recovering.

B000003NA3|3.0|I'm 19 years old, and have enjoyed listening, but most of all, playing classical and jazz music whether it be on the flute, electric guitar, or drum practice pad, yet i've realized after purchasing this recording that with 7 years of experience I still can't understand Coltrane's genius...I keep listening to this recording and it all sounds like high school concert band level (not even jazz band) -_-...I find it hard to believe that that's the case, so i've come to the conclusion that i'm still young and lack experience...i feel embarrassed to post this as an up-and-coming musician, but i'm hoping someone can clear this up for me.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|I was anxiously awaiting this 4th installment in the Twilight series, and bought it as soon as it became available for the Kindle.  I did enjoy the book, just not as much as the previous 3.  I believe that what made it different for me was not so much the storyline but the narrative. Stephenie Meyer just didn't seem as comfortable writing as Jacob. The first part of the book seemed a bit disjointed and didn't engage me the way she normally does.  When Bella's narrative took over, Meyer was in her groove and the book clicked for me from there. Overall, I would recommend this book, it just doesn't live up to the 3 that lead up to it.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter along with two other videos, this one is her favorite. She is only two but she knows what a funny movie is.
B0000029DD|3.0|3 1/2    It is an amazing debut, and of course a bittersweet release, but I can't ever shake the feeling of overachieving all over this thing. The diverse ten song set showcases Buckley's premier falsetto and many of its incarnations with some haunting rock variety, but for every grace  occurring, it sounds like as many or more steps are taken towards overkill, musically and vocally piling on top of things only to muddle their significance. In effect the most memorable songs occur when a less ambitious, more minimalist agenda is at stake (hence the ill-represented success of Hallelujah) but throughout many overreaching compositions Buckley hits many-a-stride in between.

B00006L83N|5.0|Many consider Symphony X's latest release, Paradise Lost, the band's heaviest to date. As heavy as it is, I believe the people who say so are slightly mistaken. It is the SECOND-heaviest Symphony X album to date.    The Odyssey, from it's first moment, contains more of Allen's raspy vocals (vs. his cleaner singing), more curb-stomping riffs, and even a few classic thrash elements (The Turning, Incantations of the Apprentice). If you're more into Symphony X's traditional keyboard/guitar trading solos and ballads, you're better off with V.    The heavily-syncopated two-note riff contained on King of Terrors is the most brutal sound I've heard in my entire life. That and the 13-time riff on Wicked beat anything Becoming the Archetype, Dream Theater, Into Eternity, or Opeth has ever put out.    The exception is the album's title track. This 24-minute epic is more classic Symphony X, with heavy orchestration and more melodic metal sounds.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I am a big Shinedown fan from the beginning and loved the first CD, but tepid about the second one. I had read reviews about this CD not sounding like either of the first CD's and I was a little aprehensive purchasing it, but went ahead anyway and let me tell you, I am very happy that I had. The CD rocks!! I have listened to it at least 20 times completely through since I purchased it and I really love every song. There is more musically going on than the first two CD's and the vocals are stellar and I feel there are at least 4 or 5 singles from The Sound Of Madness. Enjoy!
0930289234|1.0|I bought this when it first came out in the 80's and couldn't make it through.  This week I set out to read it, as the film has been made.  20 years hasn't resulted in a change of opinion.  The storyline is as hacky as a 30's radio show. The dialogue is lifeless. The pirate story subplot is boring and anticlimactic.  All in all, just a complete waste of time.<br /><br />One short story by John Varley is more interesting.
0783225857|4.0|I recently read the book, \\"To kill a mockingbird\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it. I know it is required reading in most high schools, but I've never had the opportunity and I'm 61 years old!<br />  After reading the book, I just HAD to have the DVD so I could watch it anytime I wished.<br />  The DVD was excellent! Of course, it is in black & white, but nevertheless, very well done. The video did not follow the book entirely, a few things were left out, but all in all. It is a great DVD!
B001BGTWXI|4.0|The majority of the fans out there will not like this album at first. I know I didn't. I listened to it beginning to end about three times and then threw on their self titled to clear the palette.<br /><br />I returned to it about 6 hours later and gave it another shot. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. This is one of those albums that just has to grow on you. It's not as good as their self titled or vol. 3, but it's better than Iowa and Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat.<br /><br />The major issues I would cite are balance and complexity. The album is all over the place in terms of light and heavy. Some songs Corey is just screaming, some he's just singing, some are both. It seems so randomly put together. As far as complexity, the guitar riffs are mostly power chords and most the time it seems like Joey's the only one playing the drums. Usually Slipknot's songs are a wall of sound. With 9 members, each playing something, and with the talent we all know they posess I think this album was a step back in regards to production value. Lyrically I think it falls a little short of Corey's capabililty.<br /><br />All in all though, it's still Slipknot. If you're a fan you'll find at least something in here to appreciate.
B0017P7MOO|4.0|The new album from Elbow marks a welcome return to something that has been missing from a good many CD's lately: Dynamics. I have not heard this kind of fidelity since the likes of Steely Dan or the underappreciated [[ASIN:B00000I3JO Blue Nile]], \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" is a sonic delight. From the opening cascades of \\"Starlings\\" to the final farewell of \\"Friend of Ours,\\" Elbow has concocted an enveloping orchestral whirl of music.<br /><br />The sound of the band seems to fall somewhere between [[ASIN:B000069AUI Coldplay's]] pop-progressive and [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]] era Radiohead's more straightforward days, while showcasing Guy Garvey's gravelly voice, literate lyrics and showing a deeply melancholic bent. While the most accessible work here, \\"Grounds For Divorce,\\" is a harder edged blues number, most of the songs here drift through their sad tales of loss (\\"The Bones of You\\"), a friend's self-destruction (\\"Some Riot\\") and loneliness (\\"Tower Crane Driver\\"). \\"Starlings\\" is even deeper, as the older man dreams of being an acceptable suitor for the younger partner he sees and \\"dreamed of you and I/and marriage in an orange grove,\\" all while reconciling himself to this dismal resignation.<br /><br />\\"I guess I'm asking you to<br />back a horse that's good for glue<br />and nothing else.<br />But find a man that's truer than,<br />find a man that needs you<br />more than I.\\"<br /><br />When Graves finally does allow love to overwhelm him, it's a weird sort of sublime giddiness. The \\"Mirrorball\\" couplet \\"We took the town to town last night, we kissed like we invented it\\" catches the tone perfectly while still holding Elbow's sophisticated musical excitement in check. If bands like Coldplay, [[ASIN:B000005RS5 later Talk Talk]], The Blue Nile or [[ASIN:B000F3UADO Snow Patrol]] wet your whistle, then Elbow's lush \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" should be seen...and heard.
0061191981|5.0|One of the many complaints about Gordon Ramsay is his harshness. Many people I know dislike him because of his treatment and apparent belittlement of his contestants on Hell's Kitchen. (Season 1 now available on DVD - [[ASIN:B0012U9IN2 Hell's Kitchen: Season 1]])    Read this book and you will have that feeling no more.     The best attribute of this book for me was reading about all of his life experiences and to see how they shaped who he is today. It really becomes evident when you watch him on television. If you think he is harsh to the Hell's Kitchen contestants, listen to what happened to him working for Joel Robuchon and Marco Pierre White. Incredible.     Not only do you feel for him because of his situations with his family, but you really develop a full-blown respect for him. He was, is and always will be a very classy and mature man.     His narrative just sails you through this book. It is quite a wonderful story to read. You will love the stories that you read. It will change the way you look at Gordon forever!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|AT LAST! A Dr. Seuss movie that is...Seuss!<br /><br />Perhaps I should say, first of all, that Dr. Seuss was, at least the estimation of many, a literary genius--though, as goes without saying, of a special variety. There is good reason to suspect that his legacy will survive right along side of Mother Goose, the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen; with the passing centuries, his stories may well only become more and more synonymous with classic, timeless fairy tales and children's fables. He was ahead of his time in more ways than one, and what his editor at Random House has recently said of him is almost a truism: \\"What his books have to say about fairness, discrimination, peace, the environment, consumerism, and humanity in general is finding more advocates each year.\\"<br /><br />Was Dr. Seuss politically correct? In his beginner books, Dr. Seuss helps children to read by showing what they already know; he mixes a few hundred words from a child's vocabulary with phonetic nonsense words--while at the same time coining new words. He remains true to the fact that alphabetic language is not just a matter of phonics, while at the same time not putting on dreary airs that phonics has nothing to do with alphabetic language. He also tells meaningful stories without talking down to his readers; he tells truths that children can understand but ones which adults need every bit as much to hear. In 'Green Eggs and Ham,' for example, he reminds us not to judge things we don't understand, and that persons can freely be who they are--'I am Sam'--while at the same time not pretending a sweeping presumption that 'good' is purely relative and that 'right and wrong' are simply a matter of the situation: While oblivious to being bombarded by Sam's arguments--'Would you like them here or there?...in a house...with a mouse?'--the character still concludes: 'Say!...I do! I like them, Sam-I-am!...I will eat them ANYWHERE!'  In 'The Sneetches,' he points out the absurdity of racism--but free of the hidden prejudice which offers equality as a concession--; 'that day, all the Sneetches forgot about stars, and whether they had one or not, upon thars.' Thars? And in 'Horton Hears a Who' (which invokes Seuss' all-important, whole language concept, 'who-ville'), he teaches that a person's a person, no matter how small--yet with the one still in the kangaroo pouch being that last to realize it: 'ME, TOO!' Political correctness may be defined as morality without any tie to truth. Dr. Seuss tongue-ties the most elaborate political correctness--in favor of the simplest of truths.<br /><br />I've long been a fan of the cartoon versions of both 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' and 'Horton Hears a Who,' and, that being said, I also do think this cinema, computer animated version of the latter is the best \\"action\\" adaptation of Seuss' yet made. Visually as well as otherwise, this film somehow or another is unsurpassed in capturing Seuss--and I think 'Horton Hears a Who' is Seuss' masterpiece. Refreshingly, unlike some other movie renditions of Seuss--which have sometimes even seemed intentionally ugly (something not very Seussian)--: who-ville is simply who-ville, as Seuss-like as can be. A delight--and perhaps even something before only beheld in the imagination--even given Seuss' unique and distinctive illustrations in his books; certainly the best use of pure CGI I've seen (not overcoming, of course, its intrinsic limitations).<br /><br />Yet there is also a curious dimension of the film, one which, perhaps despite itself, only goes to show Seuss' genius. The movie takes several liberties with the book, as movies do, but two are especially worth mentioning: In the film, the mayor of who-ville is made out to be the father of a big, even 'absurdly big' family--though of many many girls and just the one boy the mayor wants as heir--; it is the defiance of the baby kangaroo, living in Horton's own Jungle of Nool (albeit still in its mother's pouch), that,in siding with Horton, changes the mind of its mother, who then also finally realizes too that there really are tiny people in the speck on the clover. In the book, by contrast, the mother kangaroo changes her mind on her own, after hearing what Horton could hear all along with his big elephant ears--telling Horton that 'I'm going to protect them with you'--with the baby kangaroo merely echoing her. Curious here too is that the film even throws a punch against home schooling, having the narrow minded, prejudiced, kangaroo mother, speak on its behalf. What was the point of these liberties? To poke fun at big families and home schoolers? Yet these very twists also come together in the end, when in a special way it is just these children of the who-ville mayor, joining forces with the baby in the kangaroo pouch, that finally succeed in conveying the message that Horton tried to convey in vain: 'We are here! We are here! We are here! We are here!' Hollywood underscores Seuss' pro-life message? Curious...<br /><br />Was that dimension already in the book, or not? The standard response of Seuss' widow: no. Was giving a different response the intent of the makers of this movie? That might be strange. So do we have here, instead, a sort of blow-back from a fumbled attempt to man-handle Seuss--and make him speak politically-correct-ese? Was this an attempt automatically foiled, like trying to escape from Chinese finger-cuffs by force, or tampering with a child-resistant cap on a medicine bottle?<br /><br />Some people say that the masterpieces of Mozart or Beethoven or Chopin cannot be truly appreciated or understood unless you know the biographies of the artists, because art, ultimately, is self-expression. Other people say that if art is nothing but self-expression, then the best artists would and should never be appreciated or understood by anyone but themselves. Yet other people say that an artwork itself tells us something about the artist, and in the great, timeless masterpieces, that is precisely because it shaped and influenced the artist as much as anyone else who will ever have contact with it and appreciate it.<br /><br />If Dr. Seuss' 'Horton Hears a Who' does not have a pro-life message, then nor is about McCarthy and 1950s' paranoia, nor is it about celebrating diversity in opinions, values and lifestyles--nor even about the Japanese victims of the atomic blasts, to whom Seuss evidently, in some way, dedicated the story. Perhaps it rises above all of these themes in the same way that Chopin's etudes rise above his love life. Perhaps, in the end, its simply about how carefully we are willing to listen. Whatever the meaning of the story (it seems to me there are multiple levels, and multiple possible interpretations), what does not seem to be left to a matter of opinion is whether or not \\"there are any whos in who-ville.\\" The truth is the truth no matter how small, and a lie is a lie, no matter how tall.<br /><br />By whatever Seuss-like crooked lines it took to get there, this is a very good film, and faithful enough to Seuss to at least make people--young and old--think, laugh--and really care that all the whos in who-ville shout loud enough to be heard...
B000GY729M|5.0|I've owned this album for so long now and it still finds its way into my CD player all the time.   \\"Sam's Town\\" is really underrated. The Killers have definitely shown growth from their first record on to this one. Lyrically, this album has so much to offer and is quite thought-provoking.  The album is built around \\"When You Were Young,\\" \\"Bones,\\" \\"Bling\\" and \\"This River Is Wild.\\" - Four amazing songs. The rest of the record is almost equally good with a complete lack of filler songs.  I REALLY reccomend this album. If you don't own it, please give it a try :)
B001DHXT20|5.0|I really liked this movie a lot and i am very glad that is finally out for preorder. I wish i could have afforded the 3 disc, but hey i just want the movie.
B00005AG7K|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005AG7K Magical Mystery Tour]] Great to see The Beatles, as always, slightly ahead of their time!  Banned by the press at the time, it's cool to watch it now given what has transpired with MTV, etc. They were simply \\"paving the way\\" for such!  Any way you \\"cut it,\\" it's still THE BEATLES!!! They're \\"waiting to take you away!\\" :-)
1416524800|2.0|Like others already wrote, i enjoyed the beginning of the book. I have read \\"the Swarm\\" and this reminded me a little of that great book. I got excited cause I thought this will be great. Unfortunately it cannot compete with \\"the Swarm\\" in any way because things just get too crazy, there are too many twists.<br />Everything is just confusing. I didnt enjoy this book as much as i have enjoyed Angels and Demon.<br />If you really want a phantastic read with lots of knowledge and a great plot then read \\"The Swarm\\" by Frank Schaetzing. Its an amazing book.
B001BGTWXI|2.0|All hope is gone..... of the true heavy metal slipknot coming back?  This cd is extremely slow and besides a couple of high points (psycosocial) is not what we have all come to love about slipknot.  Alot of people are defending slipknot saying it;s what alot of fans wanted... well if soft music that doesn't flow very well is what you want your probably listening to the wrong genre of music.  Hugely dissapointed guess i'll stick with Vol. 3 for another 4 years and hope they redeem themselves?
0316067601|5.0|Reading the negative reviews and then reading the book I have to wonder if these negative reviewers and I read the same book. I think the guy is allowed his opinions after what he went through. Not to mention his opinions are just common sense. Also I love the reviews that say no spec ops soldier would ever kill an innocent civilian. I remember that during the first Gulf war a Green Beret team was sent to check out a MSR and they had the same choice to make. They also didn't kill the goat herders and almost died. So in the future if it comes between our boys coming home or the goat herder, unsheath your steel and go to work. Real Americans want to see our brave warriors come home alive.     This is the most worthwhile book. A story that every person should be familiar with. So don't let the liberals who hate the military and their country turn you off too a fine read.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|I am not going to compare this album with everything else Slipknot has done.  Everyone else is doing that anyway.  What is the point, really, of comparing album to album?  Do you want to hear the same thing over and over again?  Personally I like to hear some variance and a wide range of structure on a record.  If you are open to that, then you will like All Hope is Gone.    The album starts out really heavy, like you would expect from Slipknot. And it ends the same way.  In the middle there is just about everything you could think of.  Even the ballad \\"Snuff\\" is a refreshing change for the band.  I did not expect to hear anything like this on a Slipknot record, but it is really, really good.  I find myself listening to that song over and over.    Lyrically I think the album is great.  The flow of the album is a little strange and takes some getting used to.  Fast, slow, fast, medium, slow, etc.  The recording is very clean and the production is different than past records.  As someone mentioned above it is difficult to tell that there are 9 members on this recording.  I can rarely distinguish any drums other than Joey's.  Chris and Shawn were not really busy with their past amount of activity.    All in all this is a great album.  I am still getting used to it and I am shocked and suprised by the variety of music on one disc.  I can tell you this, it is not what you expect.  And in some cases that can be a good thing.  I think this is a refreshing album and I am enjoying listening to it.  Quit trying to compare what the band did 15 years ago to now and just appreciate what you have right in front of you........the latest masterpiece.
1573228737|4.0|I recently read Fingersmith by Sarah Waters and I loved it.  I thought Sarah Waters did a wonderful job of creating realistic characters and a fabulously complicated story that was taut with suspense from beginning to end.<br /><br />Affinity was also very well written and I felt strongly about the characters she created, the story was good and there were surprises, though it was not as taut as Fingersmith.<br /><br />I was moved by this story and can say that it was well done, my only disappointment is in what happens...which is almost unfair to judge a book by.<br /><br />I did enjoy reading about the Spiritualist Movement, it reminded me of Megan Chance's recent novel, The Spiritualist.<br /><br />Sarah Waters is a talented writer and I will be reading more from her.
B000I9YWDO|4.0|I watch it over and over again. Very funny movie and something most office workers can relate to. Reports due, incompetent managers, etc
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Outside of being an acknowleged CLASSIC, the colors on my HDTV LCD blew me away!  The techinques used to produce this have not yet been matched by ANY of the modern processes.  If you wish to show off your new tv and see a great movie, this is the one to get.
B001AU8ZLK|4.0|Get's better the more you listen. Has new sound with pleasant melody. Nothing will ever touch PARACHUTES!
0312360266|3.0|This book is definitely an easy read.  It's cheap, easy entertainment.  That's not to say I didn't like it.  I loved the theme of tolerance in the book and accepting others the way they are.  I thought some of the racy scenes and cursing was a bit much for a YA novel, but to each his own.  If you're looking for a teenage vampire novel with a little romance and self-indulgence, then look no further, the House of Night series is for you.
B0012CCNUU|5.0|One of my all-time favorites. It was in perfect condition and at a good price.    Thank you.
B001675SOY|5.0|Hatebreeder has cemented itself in my top 5 favorite albums largely because of the ultra melodic styling of the leads played by Laiho.  The music comes across as heavy and aggressive but there are great melodies over top from the guitar and the keys.  The cover of Aces High is a pretty great \\"blackened\\" version of the Maiden favorite.  This album represents a style that has started disappearing in more recent Bodom work which still features shred but doesn't have as many complex melodies as this album does.  You can find a lot of melodies that are reminiscent of melodies you might find in concert/\\"classical\\" music.  No Bodom fan should be without it, any guitar fan should at least listen to it.  Memorable tracks include \\"Silent Night, Bodom Night\\", \\"Toward Dead End\\" (renamed on this re-release \\"Cowards Dead End\\"), and \\"Downfall\\".  Of course if you're one of those that can't get past the screaming, then you're not going to like it anyway.  I encourage you to at least give it a shot.

031606792X|1.0|This was not what I expected. I was so excited for this book, that I actually counted down the days and bought it on the first day it was released.     However, the poor writing and absurd story line left me feeling very disappointed.      For me, the story ends at Eclipse.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual.     It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.     Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock.     Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. Sussudio is a great, great song, a personal favorite.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Who would have thought that this could be done?  Stringing a story through the soundtrack of our lives could have been trite.  The movie though, captures the times between 1964 and 1969 perfectly.  The evolution of the politics, music and graphic imagery mirrors what I remember.  The references to charactors and historical people is very clever, and it was all done without being a slave to literalism.  The interpretations of the songs are novel and imaginative.  \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\", \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" and \\"Carry That Weight\\"  are totally unexpected, but in an alternate universe, could be just what Lennon and McCartney intended.    As a separate issue, I was bowled over by Diana Fuchs' performance.  She channels Janis Joplin and Joan Osborne without imitating them, and is proof positive of the magic of the blues.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost.     He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humor.    In '87, Huey released \\"Fore!\\", their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.

B000JK8OYU|2.0|I bought the CD as a reaction to the movie \\"Across the Universe\\" and because I had heard a few cuts at a friend's house.  After the novelty wore off, I realized i had heard it all before.  Many of the cuts used tracks from the previously released \\"Anthologies\\", so there was really nothing new.  It is interesting to listen to another person's opinion on how the wealth of the Beatle's catalogue could be remixed, but it may only make real artistic sense if you also see the Cirque de Solier performance.

B001AIRUP4|5.0|I won't review the film itself since most people are familiar with the story. This is one of the BEST video transfers I've experienced to date !! If you buy blu-ray discs than you know your either gonna be blown away by the HD experience, or $30 broker and left with a mediocre updated flick. I am happy to report that the picture is beautiful, and with 7.1 surround sound, the soundtrack is better than ever! Also loaded with extras like deleted scenes, \\"Vincent\\" a short film narrated by Vincent Price, and Tim Burton's original FrankenWeenie film. A MUST BUY FOR FANS!
031606792X|1.0|*Spoilers*  I don't have much to add to the reviews that can see this book for what it is, a jumble of words forced together, and stamped with SM's name, in an attempt to justify its existence.  Not only was the writing bad, and the story forced and unbelievable, things that were outright ugly happened to make it even worse. Namely Edward asking Jacob to have sex with Edward's own wife, (something no honorable man in reality would ever do) and Jacob imprinting on an infant that no amount of forced explanation could ever make okay.  (In reality, no responsible human would be okay with an adult man being fixated on a baby to the point that he is convinced he will have a romantic/sexual relationship with that child when it is older.)       Having said that, for those of you who think that SM did what she did because she's a Mormon, please don't believe that.  She did what she did in spite of being a Mormon.  Most LDS (Mormons) I talk to, (at least the adults) despise the series, and especially this last book.  I myself am LDS, and can say unequivocally, that this is the worst published book I have ever read.      Bella, to be quite frank, is and has been a terrible example to young women about how to be, and how to live one's life. The way she treats herself, Edward, Jacob and those around her, were she a real person, would show that she does not love Edward, Jacob, or anyone else, because she isn't even capable of loving/valuing herself, and the truth remains, unchangably, that you cannot love someone else unless you love yourself first!     In answer to the argument that it's JUST fiction, the answer to that, is no, it's not JUST fiction.  Fictional books serve a need.  Why do people read for hours and hours about characters that don't exist?  They fill a need in us, and help us establish our own internal values, and our sense of right and wrong.  Most books help readers see people struggle and strive, and ultimately overcome problems, and the readers of such books like them because the books help us, their readers, understand how better to deal with our own real life problems.      Also, Fiction, regardless of it's being JUST fiction, still needs to keep its own rules.  Being a writer myself, I know very well the importance of an author keeping the rules of whatever world she creates.  SM not only broke her own rules, she shattered them, set them on fire, then spread manure over the ashes.  Also, even though it is fiction, we still gain our internal values from what we read.  This book, and the others that precede it sell the idea to people that they don't need to struggle and strive and make themselves into better people in order to deserve a reward.  People who buy into such thinking become angry and demanding in real life when hot men or cool cars, or good grades or other sorts of rewards, be they whatever they are, don't just drop into their laps.  Dangerous fuel to add to a society that is already dangerously complacent.      What SM did, was a prostitution of literature, and it is a monumentally sad thing that this book, as well as the others that are barely better than this one, are so popular.  As a mother a writer and a teacher who cares about kids, (they are more than just dollar signs to me) I seriously worry about the future of our young people because of the message in this book.  There was already confusion in the world about what sort of behavior signifies whether someone truly loves someone else or not, but as I said earlier, these books added fuel to the fire, and SM should be (but probably isn't) ashamed of what she's done.
B000PC0S5K|1.0|Was Oprah kidding with this book? I can't even force myself to finish this book. This is a book of a bunch of nothing that goes in circles. I am sure the author would say this is my giant ego speaking (he speaks a lot about our egos) and he's right, my ego and I have wasted enough time.
0930289234|5.0|After seeing the trailer for the Watchmen film, I became very interested in the Graphic Novel. Now I can't put it down. Since I recieved it in the mail, I've read it through cover to cover three times. And after doing this I honeslty don't know how a comprehensive movie can be made. There is just so much going on in this book. The stroy does not focus so much on action, as the movie trailer makes it seem, but instead on character development. And what characters they are. Each one is more complex than anything I have read before. Rorsharch is by far one of the best characters ever written and is now forever in my top ten fictional characters of all time. The other thing that really impressed me about this book was the interesting juxtopositions of different media. The comic-within-a-comic idea was extremely well done, and brings a whole new level to the story. Its this more than anything else that will be missing from the movie.<br /><br />In closing, if you like comics, no, if you like a complex story with well defined characters, Watchmen is for you!
1593081545|4.0|I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and while I like Mansfield Park, it's my least favorite.  Mansfield Park is more out of line with her others because the heroine is not a spunky, witty girl but rather shy and reserved.  But I don't think that was my issue with the book so much as the pace.  This is a longer book and is so not because of more action or intrigue but because some of the scenes (like the preparation for a play) drag on and on.  Perhaps more frustrating is that while fairly pointless scenes are expanded too much the resolution to the love games is very brief and I wished she'd played up the eventual falling in love more.  I would recommend the book but not as an Austen first because I don't think it does justice to her ability.
B001B71NOI|5.0|This CD shows that Trent Reznor (Frontman of Nine Inch Nails) still has the creative mind to compose music worthy of our generation. Though over the recent years he has surely mellowed out in terms of hard-hitting loud and violent music, he is still creating melodies and lyrics that still define what Nine Inch Nails really is. The Slip is perfect for newcomers because of its short play time and catchy songs. The single \\"Discipline\\" is a wonderful example of his catchy songs that any fan of music would appreciate. \\"Echoplex\\" ends with a wonderful melody that might leave people humming it in their head. Unlike most Nine Inch Nails records this ends on a less slow ending with \\"Demon Seed\\" which has a mysterious meaning as to where Trent Reznor is taking his music in the future.
031606792X|5.0|This book was great. I received it on a Thursday at 4pm and finished it the next day at 2p.m. I could not put it down. Stephanie Meyers is brilliant I cannot wait until we hear it from Edwards prospective! The Twilight series is utterly amazing the best series I have ever read!
1591841992|2.0|Dan Roam's \\"Back of the Napkin\\" is an important first step in teaching business people how to compose problems visually. However, it's definitely a rookie effort, heavy on sizzle but light on steak.<br /><br />Roam spends nearly half the book explaining how our minds process information. Okay, fine. Kind of like a book on how to build a house explaining what is a hammer, a saw, a drill. Then Roam proposes some different ways to draw the different ways the brain processes information. Kind of like showing that a hammer is good for nailing wood together, a saw is good for dividing wood in half, and a drill is good for drywall and screws. The reader cannot wait to see how this will all fit together - \\"This is going to be good!\\". Finally, Roam throws out an example of how to pull it all together to solve a problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the example is overly-easy, explores many blind alleys, and finally arrives at a solution that is fundamentally flawed. Roam's case study shows flat sales for a proprietary software company for two years. Roam's analysis shows $78 million in proprietary software will be purchased next year vs. $48 million in open source. The solution - convert their software into open source. Huh? Leave a $78 million industry to a single competitor to compete with two other open-source vendors for a $48 million industry? What kind of solution is that? Will you fire all your developers and hire open source developers? Will you force your existing customers to move to open source too, or just abandon them?<br /><br />In the end, after many chapters of \\"wait till you see this\\" type posturing, Dan Roam never delivers the goods. I don't doubt Roam's sincerity, and hope he will continue to iterate on his models until he comes back with something that actually works.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|The Jonas Brothers have obviously grown up on this third album. It much less frivolity, screaming, and randomness than the other two.. not that I didn't enjoy that. It's just that this seems much more of a cd by real musicians as opposed to a catchy boy band. Basically.. I totally loved it. In fact, I'm listening to it right now :)    Track by track review.    1. BB Good: (0/10) Wow. All I can say is no. I didn't like this at all. I've read reviews of people who just absolutely adored this. I found it weird and random when Joe was talking and screaming about \\"I want to kiss you! It was just... wow. No. I don't know why people liked it, but I'm guessing since most people did, you did too, so just don't be mad. It was a really weird way to start the album out, though I'm sure all the teen girls liked it. This was the only track on the cd that I really don't like much at all. I always start the cd at track 2. Sorry :(    2. Burnin' Up: (10/10) Wow. In the totally right kind of way. Unlike the rest of the teen girl demographic (which I am a part of) I had not been watching Disney Channel enough lately to have heard this song a billion songs and have it ruined for me. I'd heard of it, and maybe even seen the video, and I thought it was unbearably painfully cheesy, but it really really grows on you after a while. It's got a great beat, and it's quite different from their other songs. The lyrics aren't genius, though that's not really anything new, but it's just plain catchy. I loved it.    3. Shelf (7/10): I liked the idea of this song, and the lyrics for it, but the beat really didn't do anything for me. It didn't have much of a defined melody. I still liked it, just not my ABSOLUTE favorite.    4. One Man Show (6/10): I didn't love this track, but unlike the other people reviewing it I didn't give it 0 out of 10 stars. That's ridiculous. You know what.. at least it's the slightest bit different from their other songs. I think the teen girls didn't like it just because Nick was telling everybody that he was a one man show, and he didn't need them, haha. Not great lyrics, or vocals, but not HORRIBLE.    5. Lovebug (10/10): this is really where the album really starts to heat up. This is totally different for JB, and it's pretty awesome. The vocals are amazing on this track, and the boys sound totally different, and the strange instruments are great. I didn't have a problem with the talking in the background. I didn't find it very distracting, and nick explains about it on the CDVU+ or w/e that thing was called. This was great. I think they should do more stuff like this on the next album.    6. Tonight (9/10): This song is just plain catchy. The chorus is really nice, and I like the intro. Vocals and lyrics aren't bad either.    7. Can't Have You (8/10): This song was really very sad. But it was actually quite different from them. Liked it. I thought the vocals were good, and so were the lyrics.    8. Video Girl (10/10): It starts out funny, and it just gets better. It's good to see JB poking fun at the world that they live in. This song is wicked infectious.    9. Pushin' Me Away (10/10): Oddly enough I think this actually is my favorite song on the album. I like the way it starts, and I like the deep sound of Joe's voice on this one. I think I'm in the majority with this being my favorite, but it is. I thought the vocals and lyrics were awesome on this one.    10: Sorry (9/10): I loved this one, especially the way it starts. Very emotional, though the reason it didn't get 10 points was because on the second chorus Nick's voice is incredibly incredibly excruciatingly painful to listen to the first time. You get used to it, but it's REALLY frightening the first time.    11: Got Me Going Crazy (10/10): It got me going crazy! haha. I love this song. It's kind of cliche, but it has a great beat at the beginning, and it's just really really catchy. I can't really explain why I like it so much. It's kind of cookie cutter, but the vocals are pretty good and I like the chorus.    12: A Little bit Longer (10/10): Nick's voice sounds really good here, and it's obvious that it comes from the heart. I just feel for the poor kid when I listen to this song. It's a good slow song that really showcases his voice.    I give this album five stars, because I only have to just skip over one track which is really really rare for me. Plus, I'm starting to get used to BB Good, and maybe... maybe one day it will get 4 out of 10 stars! haha.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|My star rating is for the cd.  I'm a huge fan of each album, so I'm coming from there.  This one didn't let me down.  As for the bonus dvd, it was clips with little dialogue, much like an artistic piece.  I would rather have seen the band talking about the recording process.  Even the parts when they play aren't very long.  A lot of shots of a car stuck in mud, them walking in the giant masks, still no talking.  Probably won't ever watch the thing again.  It is about 35 minutes long total.
B0015KO52S|4.0|Consolers of the Lonely was sprung upon the public a mere three weeks after completion in yet another unorthodox indie music release. The Raconteurs successfully avoided any pre-release media hype/promotion, and got their newest album into everyone's hands (in all formats) at the same time.<br /><br />Although this could be perceived as a rushed album release, the final product sounds anything but rushed. Simply put, Consolers of the Lonely is what The Raconteurs should have released as their first album. Raw and energetic, with ballsy storytelling done in Jack White's bard-like fashion. Rid yourself of any preconceived notions, because if you're expecting a carbon copy of Broken Boy Soldiers, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />With Brendan Benson and Jack White at the songwriting helm, The Raconteurs have merged energy and writing styles in a cohesive yet abrasive album. They've taken a softer version of The Raconteurs and transformed the band into a harder rocking, more in your face reincarnation, with shades of Meg White's \\"bash and slam\\" drum style interspersed throughout the album. Besides the strong instrumentals and vocal performances, the backbone of the album resonates from White and Benson's storytelling.<br /><br />The title track kicks off the album, immediately informing the listeners that The Raconteurs have moved away from the ballad-y nature of their former selves, which is a very welcome evolution. Stepping up the power and rock content truly showcases the talent within the band. \\"Salute Your Solution\\" seems to be their first single (and video), as it puts a true garage rock energy exclamation point on the album. Ballads aren't completely absent from the album, as the piano driven \\"You Don't Understand Me\\" gives a pleasant tempo and sentiment change within the album. Throughout Consolers of the Lonely, one can hear The Raconteurs' many influences: The Who, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, The Allmans, as well as a bit of traditional country elements.<br /><br />Broken Boy Soldiers failed to speak to me in the same manner as Consolers. The Raconteurs have combined their respective strengths and released an album which they truly needed to produce. With Consolers of the Lonely, The Raconteurs have transcended the Stripes' shadow and ultimately released an album which has the potential to be one of the albums of the year.to speak to me in the same manner as Consolers.

B0013URJTG|4.0|I waited long and hard for this re-release, and I'm happy I was patient. The 5.1 mix is beautiful, and the stereo disc sounds great, but this is no news for PT fans used to Steven Wilson's wizardry.  The album is great, better than Stupid Dream in my opinion. The songs have more personality and identity and the album has enough variety to keep things interesting.  More akin to Stupid Dream than to In Absentia, but still showing sings of evolution in that direction.  I like comparing this version of Shesmovedon with the one in Deadwing. It's hard to improve a great song, leave that to Steven Wilson.
0061537934|4.0|Outstanding book written very well, but so very sad.  Enzo was the best. Makes you look at your own dog differently!
B000AL730O|5.0|This album was made by someone who has experienced a lot of life: you can hear the world-weariness in Paul's voice, lyrics, and music.  Yet, there's a very pleasing optimism throughout the album.  The melodies perfectly complement the mature, reflective lyrics.  I've listened to this album many times on my way to work in the Seattle winter as the sky changes from black to gray, and there are few albums I've enjoyed more at that time of day.  It's Paul's best work since Tug of War, maybe even since Band on the Run.
B0016B6ZKG|1.0|What a bummer of a CD. There isnt anything over the top, or memorable about the songs on this release. Why wasn't \\"I got your love\\" included on this release? \\"I'm a fire\\" is way too long, and \\"Stamp your feet\\" only makes you want to stamp your feet in disgust. Skip this one.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Once again I feel compelled to comment on Emmylou's music.  When I first saw this disk I read various reviews here whining that this album is a \\"downer\\" and the like.  I smiled to myself and bought it without a second thought.  I would have bought it no matter what the reviews said.  Yes, Emmylou sings about pain, but she also sings about redemption and perseverance, the dawn that follows the darkness.  Anyway, what price do you put on music that brings tears to your eyes?    But I am writing just to comment on one track from this disk.  \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul\\", a song that did not grab me when I heard the author's version two decades ago, is rescued here and made Emmylou's own.  The song includes the lines: \\"hunger only for a taste of justice, hunger only for a world of truth.\\"  The depth of longing in the \\"hunger only\\", the slight hush of reverence in \\"justice\\" and \\"truth\\".  Those lines, at this time, in that voice...  Whatever I might think of the tracks on this album, and my opinion varies, those few seconds are worth the price of the album to me, and I would not be without it.
031606792X|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Twilight series.  All four books.  I enjoyed them, which is not to say I didn't have issues with them.  From the beginning I have had an issue with Bella ... she seems to be rather whiny and not really the type of girl one would want their daughter to identify with.  But, it's a story, it's not a big deal.    Breaking Dawn did end with everything wrapped in a neat little bow and the way it got there was not particularly excellent story-telling.  If you look beyond the things that were just overtly bad ... the majority of the time on Isle Esme, the name of the poor child, the mildly creepy overtones of Jacob's imprinting ... it is still a nice story.  Girl gets boy she loves, third person in love triangle will end up happy (in a few years, when she is old enough), family is happy, no major disasters in actually becoming immortal ...     The writing is a bit shoddy in places, but it is a bit shoddy in places in the other three books as well.  No one ever said all female young adult fiction authors had to be JK Rowling.      Focus on the overall story and perhaps you won't mind Breaking Dawn quite so much ...    Added 2/26/09: While I stand by my statements that the writing just isn't stunningly exceptional, the more time I spend with the entire Twilight Saga, the more I love it.  I just cannot stop re-reading all four books.  Sure, there are bits I skip (namely most of New Moon, when Edward isn't there, and the family stories, Carlisle, Jasper, and Rosalie), but all things considered, the *story* is what is important and draws in the reader.  Where Bella is exactly Edward's brand of heroin, the Twilight Saga is exactly a Story Lover's brand of heroin.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is much more than a graphic novel. It is a fantastically well crafted piece of literature. On top of the breathtaking imagery and top notch art work, the authorization is incredibly well done. I would highly suggest this book to any and everyone, whether they be a fan of comics or not. This book delves deeply into the many problems with today's society and hammers them out with such force it will leave you in slight disbelief afterward. You will finish this novel and want to immediately flip back to the front cover and start again, and you should. This book needs to be read a minimum two or three times to really grasp everything. Not to mention that it's better each time, because there are things there that you couldn't have possibly noticed the first time around. Read watchmen. Read it again and again.
B0016OOM7Q|5.0|Beautiful item for serious Madonna collectors. It differs from the UK version in the colouring of the vinyls.  This US version has a marbling effect on two of the vinyls (one pink, one turquoise) making them look like candy.  In the UK version the two coloured vinyls  are just plain pink and turquoise. In both sets the third vinyl is black and the CD is the same as the mainstream CD. I figure this US version will become the one that's hard to get hold of.
1576754227|4.0|I couldn't think of a more apt title for this book. We all know that procrastination is what holds us back from being successful. Sadly it's often the hardest most disagreeable tasks that get the best results. This book is not reinventing the wheel but a quick read that teaches you simple principles that make all the difference. The main idea being if you tackle your worst job first the rest of the day should be relatively painless.<br /><br />Sure the print is large and the book is thin but how much do you need to read to realize you've got to get out there and do your work? It's common sense.<br /><br />I liked the book it was just what I needed when my motivation was flagging. I figure the cost is worth what you get back and it wouldn't hurt anyone to read it once a year to stay on track. I actually also have the audio book and it fills a long drive nicely.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Kung Fu Panda is one of great movies of 2008. It is full of action, comedy, and drama. The special effects are spectacular and the characters are memorable. The movie has a great story with a great message.     So, if you are looking for a great movie, then Kung Fu Panda is the movie for you and the whole family. Buy this great movies on DVD or Blue Ray DVD and enjoy! Trust me, you'll be entertained.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|Updated on 12/27 with a slightly more objective comments.    Disclaimer: If you are a music fan whose listens to a particular genre (i.e., metal ) you are going to feel disappointed.  Specifically, if you are one of the Slipknot fans who consider Iowa to be Slipknot's best album you will definitely hate this one. However, if you like rock music in general (For example, I listen to anything from Radiohead to Slayer) then you will really appreciate this album.     Although I'm hard pressed not to pick sides and choose a favorite album, I can say that I've been listening to this album as much as I did with their self-titled debut (the one that made me a Slipknot fan to begin with).  Everyone has different musical preferences and tastes, so I can understand why people who predominantly listen to \\"metal\\" would prefer Iowa (given that it's currently the band's heaviest release). Given that I listen to a much more larger scope of music genres, I found Iowa to be be on the one-dimensional side.  To the dislike of many fans, with Vol. 3, the band made a drastic change in their music, incorporating solos, adding more melodic choruses, and varying the tempo of the music in the whole album and within songs. At the time of its release I was a bit shocked at the new direction of the band. However, now I understand that it was all part of the natural evolution of the band and a stepping stone to All Hope is Gone.  With the new album, Slipknot has been able to capture the best elements of all their previous albums while maintaining flow/structure through all the songs.  They have continue to expand their sound and grow musically, which any music fan in general should greatly appreciate.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|Kung Fu Panda is one of the greatest CGI animated movies that has ever been created. The movie has lots of action and humor, plus there is many memorable and likable characters.    Po the panda (voiced by Jack Black), is just downright funny and entertaining. The other characters are also very amusing and are fun to watch. Do you want my opinion? Then buy this movie when it is released. Its a great film with a great message.
B000002UA2|4.0|Sandwiched between Meddle and Dark Side is this album, which is unjustly forgotten about due to the fact that it's overshadowed by the masterpiece that immidiatly followed it. Which is a real shame, becuase there's some good stuff on here that definetly paved the way for Dark Side Of The Moon. Listening to this album, you can tell that they were destined for greatness, but it hasn't quite shown just yet. There's some damn good melodies on this album that's closer to Dark Side then Meddle. The title track and When You're In are both highlights with it's gritty synth patterns, carefully constructed guitar bends, and one powerful 3-chord riff. It's definetly a \\"cities burning\\" type of track that Pink Floyd did so well in the 70's. It's more accented on playing than sound, which is great. Childhood's End is another underrated classic, basically the blueprint for Time. It even has the tick-tock clock effect! Wot's...Uh The Deal is another classic, with lyrics about getting old (here we go again with Dark Side) and a melody that would easily fit on said album. Burning Bridges is essentially a reprise of Echoes, and also, a precursor to Breathe too. The Gold It's In The is a really upbeat rocker that always manages to move me, and Free Four, a little country tune about Roger's dead father, is another deep track that I enjoy. Anyone who loves Dark Side and doesn't listen to this album is surely missing something. It really is the next link to bigger and better things.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|The Show: 5/5<br /><br />Since it first came on in August of 2003 I was hooked. I mean HOOKED. I watched the original broadcasts of the \\"summer season\\"--AND the weekend re-runs of the episodes that just aired a few day before. AND I taped them and watched them a 3rd or 4th time. It's almost like when you drive home tired, then can barely remember driving home--you just know you're there, and you're happy. Now, I didn't sleep through a minute of this show, but it does give me the feeling that it just flew by.<br /><br />By the end of the season, I didn't know how the creative team ended up where they did, but I was satisfied with the results. Then season 2 came, and, despite some minor lulls, I was satisfied by the end. Except for Ryan's hair, which still bothers me... Then season 3 came, with more lulls... And season 4 came, completely rejuvenating the series with Taylor, a revamped (and increasingly likeable) \\"mini Cooper\\", and a lot more fun compared to other seasons--more fun than most shows on at the time, really.<br /><br />The DVD set: 5/5<br /><br />As you can see from my pictures (I put up a lot on the product page here) the book is very well put together, and it really does hold up well. At least, it does if you handle your DVDs with care. You don't have to hold it like a live  nuke, but handle it as you would with any TV on DVD.<br /><br />The case is sturdy, as are the pages. A lot of people have complained about the cardboard slots, but I haven't had any problems with any sets that use this type of slot (Futurama movies, Simpsons sesaon 11, Alias complete series, etc). I suppose they could damage the discs, but you just have to be a little more careful. (And if you're really that worried about discs being scratched, you could buy something like the [[ASIN:B0015AB3GE Discgear Selector 80-Disc Value Disc Storage System - Black]] to store the discs in a safer way. The set would probably be smaller if they used a design similar to the Buffy and Angel complete series sets. If that were the case, we wouldn't have such a nice looking display piece, with all the nice (and BIG) promo pictures that are used within the pages.<br /><br />Most of what I want to say next is pretty much covered in the pictures that I've posted here; so for the rest of my review, check out the pictures.<br /><br />To upgrade, or not?<br /><br />In my opinion--go for it. Then again, if you don't have any season yet (chances are, if you were a fan when it was originally on, you have them already) this is a no-brainer. Back to the point. If you have some or all of the individual seasons, this set is well worth it. Especially if you have a 16:9 TV. Season 1 looks great on a nice wide HDTV. For me, that's the main reason to get this set. The bonus discs are nice, and if you're a big-time collector of TV on DVD (like me) and you like to show off your collection (like me), this is a definite eye-grabber of a box set.we wouldn't have such a nice looking display piece, with all the nice (and BIG) promo pictures that are used within the pages.

B000002U82|5.0|Honestly, what could I say about this album that hasn't already been said in thousands of rock and roll essays, books, word of mouth, etc, etc, etc? This is one of the few albums I can listen to that has absolutly NO FILLER, I've memorized the songs, and I can hear something new everytime I hear it. Powerful isn't the right word to describe this album. Revolutionary is the word. First off, the music is absolutly fantastic. Even listening to earlier Floyd albums, I would've never predicted that they would come up with something so thought-provoking, so soulful, and so powerful as this. Whether it's the floating feel of Breathe, the dark funk of Time and Money, the acid-soaked jazz of Us and Them, or the powerful anthems of Brain Damage and Eclipse, the music is excellent. Gone are the free-form noisy jams of the past, replaced by a deeper understanding of melody and resonance. Also, some great additions are a backing soul group, and a saxaphone player to give the music some extra depth and diversity. Could the band honestly make a song like Money, with a 7/8 time signature and sax solos a few years back without Syd? Most likely not. Second, the lyrics are spellbinding. There's some powerful one-liners that really hit home with the listener, especially in tracks such as Time (How on earth David Gilmour could still sing the lines \\"The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older/Shorter of breath and one day closer to death\\" while he's 65 and not feel suicidal is beyond me.) and Us and Them. They lyrics are three-dimensional, almost fourth-dimensional in their abstract way. Finally, no previous album boasted such an immaculate production or such a huge load of special effects. Beating hearts, wild laughter, maniac phrases, airplanes exploading, money ringing, clocks ticking, all of this to emphasize madness. And it works! It really, really works. It sounds like a man slowly going insane. From this point on, Pink Floyd became the giant Space Rock band that they would be infamous for. It would only be a few more years until it backfired on them.uld be infamous for. It would only be a few more years until it backfired on them.
B001EO748M|5.0|If you liked season one, you are going to love season two. However, if you only liked season one for the racy sex scenes, you will be disappointed. Season two focuses on the political aspects of Henry VIII's reign and the downfall of Anne Boleyn. The show received a ton of criticism for being historically inaccurate in season one, and thankfully, they really cleaned up their act for season two. I have since read several books (Alison Weir and David Starkey both have good ones) and the effort to make season two more accurate is obvious and I think that the viewers will appreciate that. I certainly did. Here is a summary of my favorite episodes from season two:     Episode 2- Henry tells Anne that he intends to marry her and make her Queen of England. He dubs her Marquess of Pembroke and they travel to France where Henry presents her to Francis I (King of France) as his future wife. She does an amazingly enchanting dance with her ladies for Francis I that will leave you drooling. Henry and Anne finally seal the deal; she becomes pregnant with Elizabeth I.     Episode 5- This episode is centered on the downfall of Thomas More. This is some of the finest acting work that I have ever seen. Jeremy Northam gives the performance of a lifetime. This episode will make any grown man cry. Henry makes the tough decision to execute the only man that has ever had the integrity to be honest with him and stick to his beliefs even during the political mayhem of the time. Without giving too much away, the ending sequence is breathtaking. Bravo to both Jeremy Northam and Jonathan Rhys Myers, both did a great job in this episode.     Episode 7- Anne realizes that she will never truly be Queen of England as long as Katherine is alive. She is starting to realize that her days are numbered and she is quickly losing the King's favor. Anne and Henry share a sex scene that will make your heart race. Amazing camera and editing work in this episode from the dance/sex scene to the final scene that I will explain in a second. Katherine dies and Maria Doyle Kennedy really shines as she hangs on for dear life until the very end. Anne and Henry have their infamous celebration in the courtyard and Anne has a very intense scene with her father at the very end where she announces that all is good in the world, \\"There is good news all around. Katherine is dead and I am pregnant. I am pregnant with the King's son. We are on the edge of a golden world!\\"     Episode 10- There is no doubt that season two belongs to Natalie Dormer as Anne, but here she leaves the viewers with no doubts. She IS Anne as she awaits her death in the tower and finally takes leave of the world. Calling her performance amazing would be an understatement. Everything from her quiet hysterics to her eerie calm to her infamous line, \\"I have a little neck.\\" She captures everything that we know about Anne Boleyn and her final days in the tower. I have watched this episode over and over and over again and cry like a baby every time. They really paid a lovely tribute to this fascinating woman, even down to the color of her gown and her final words as she approaches the scaffold. Brilliant!! I definitely felt a sense of loss that Natalie won't be on the show next season, but we should be proud of her representation of Anne Boleyn. Natalie will truly be missed and the other cast members have big shoes to fill.     I do want to point out a couple of things that I did notice that were inaccurate just in case people want to discuss it here. In episode one, Charles Brandon tells the King that he has remarried and that his wife's name is \\"Catherine Brooke\\" when her name was actually Catherine Willoughby. He also said that he needed a mother for his young son, when in fact, he already had 3 children by this time. Also, in episode one there is a scene where Thomas Wyatt and Anne Boleyn are in bed together. They show this as some sort of dream or figment of his imagination, but I cannot figure out why they would do this in the first place. It is known that Thomas Wyatt did have some sort of affection toward Anne, but this scene may cause a bit of confusion for viewers that aren't as familiar with the story. Also, in episode ten, after they arrest the men (Thomas Wyatt included) Cromwell tells Wyatt that he will be freed and he yells after Cromwell, \\"But I am the only one who is guilty!!\\" I don't really think that this was necessary since there is no evidence to back up any type of physical relationship between the two of them or any proof that Thomas Wyatt had some sort of obsession/imaginary relationship with Anne going on in his own mind. However, I do think that historians generally agree that he was enamored by her.
B000002UA5|3.0|Probably the biggest avant-garde album in history. That might not be a good thing though. By 1969, Pink Floyd had somewhat of a fanbase going. Their live shows were getting some good word, and due to their music being used in documentaries and films, they were able to make a decent living off of touring and recording. So, they decided to celebrate a bit and make their first double album. First things first, the live side is great. Containing four tracks, mostly from the Syd and the Syd-influenced days, this showcases early Floyd at their best. The live Astronomy Domine blows away the original. Vocal harmonies, wahed guitar, creepy keyboard solos, it's all there. Amazing how the band would work on these songs over the years and make drastic improvements. Careful With That Axe, Eugene is brilliant. There's not one note wasted, and the climax 3 mintes in is spellbinding. Set The Controls and Saucerful are both excellent live too, with Set being drastically changed to a much more spacier and intense performance. I really dig the trippy 'outer-space' keyboard section in the middle. Kewl. However, I have to say...WHAT IS WITH THE STUDIO SIDE?! Did they seriously want to alienate all their fans? This sucks! The band returns to some of the failed experimental atonal noises that they hashed out unsuccessfully on Saucerful and Piper, only this time they are \\"solo pieces.\\" Whatever, no one should listen to this garbage. Sysphus starts out interesting, almost like an ELP song, before going into harsh noise territory. Several Species is just pure garbage, I guess it would be cool if I was tripping. The Narrow Way is just amazingly dull, though there is a cool Sabbathesque riff in one section that would've been awesome had they worked on it. And the Grand Vizier thing is just a long drum solo with some weird flute noises. Bleh, this sucks!

B0013FNC38|5.0|I cannt say enough wonderful things about this album. I've been a die hard fan for years and years. So much went into making this record and it definitely paid off. The wait was worth it. These songs represent Jason so well and its so refreshing when you can hear the artist in their music. I agree with what alot of people have said, seeing him live will change your life and your outlook on music in general. Its amazing.     I thought that his old stuff would always be my favorite and he'd never make anything that I loved as much but Im happy to be proven wrong. Love Of A Child, If It Kills Me, Live High, Make It Mine, Beautiful Mess are all amazing, amazing songs. I DEFINITELY recommend getting the individual EPs of the three, we sing, we dance, we steal things. Theres nothing quite like an acoustic Jason Mraz.
B000002U9Y|3.0|Syd went crazy somewhere in 1967, so they had to get rid of him, and doing so, got the immensly more talented David Gilmour on guitar. Good choice, guys. Their sound was never the same after that, but they still had a long way to go before Meddle and Dark Side. This is the beginning of what I call the \\"finding ourselves\\" phase. The band tried to make a better album than Piper, which is fine by me, but it only succeeds in a few tracks. Let There Be More Light has a really cool bassline (Wow, Roger can play), but it degenerates into a noodling pointless jam. Remember A Day and See-Saw are both romantic hippie songs that really don't go anywhere. The good tracks, however, such as Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun and the title track, point towards the right direction. The former being a space mantra that would border on the intense level live (flaming gongs and all that), and the title track basically being orchestrated noise with an uplifting ending. These 2 tracks are the saving grace of the album, and it's almost worth the price. Jugband Blues, though, really sucks. This is Syd at his most scizophrenic, and he can barely play the melody through without changing the time signature. I guess it was a nice gesture though. On the whole, not that great, but it's a foreshadow of things to come.
0307383415|2.0|Obviously, I only bought and read the book, because Mr. Obama is in the race to become the next President.    The book is easy reading, the story he tells is interesting enough so you will not put the book away because you are bored. The father he searches for was a gifted man, who wasted his gifts, became an alcoholic and an abuse, yet is Mr. Obama's eyes, he had one redeeming quality - he was BLACK!    The book is full of racism! Not the \\"Red neck\\" kind of dumb racism, but a more sophisticated one - YET STILL RACISM!  After having read this book, it is easy to understand, why Mr. Obama had such a difficult time to separate himself from Reverend Wright - he simply believes the same racist agenda, Mr. Wright does!     Being a German national, the question of who to vote for does not arise, but I certainly feel, those Americans who contemplate voting for Mr. Obama should read this book.
B000024D4R|5.0|Well, boom, there ya go! Roger Waters takes absolute control of the group from this point on, and the result is an underrated masterpiece that sounds nothing like the earlier releases, while still having a Pink Floyd stamp on the tunes. Wow. Animals has often been called the Punky Floyd album, but that's only becuase of the angry-as-hell lyrics that Roger penned. Yet another concept album, this one deals with different classes in society being compared to animals. The high class are pigs, the middle class are dogs, and the poor are sheep. As for the music, well it's a definete step over the jamming of Wish You Were Here. The psychedelic factor is just about nil here, so a lot of rock fans can really get into this album. Pigs On The Wing starts off with Roger in a folky mood yet again, with some great lyrics, setting a mood of paranoid love. Dogs, is the brilliant excourse into the pain and violence of the album. The melody is harsh and strong, with a paranoid feel at the same time. Dave's solos are absolutly breathtaking on this song, probably the best of his career. The sound effects really help the songs and the story move along, especially the echoed \\"stone\\" that Dave sings. It really feels like someone is being drowned. One of the best \\"long\\" songs that Floyd has. Pigs is another classic, which has Roger at his absolute best singing, second only that to The Wall. The synth solo is fabulous, fitting in with the pig noises perfectly. Finally, there is Sheep, the most rocking out song that Floyd ever did. Just listen to that riff David blares out 2 minutes before the end, and tell me that doesn't make you feel like thrashing your head around. Another perfect song from a perfect album. And then we return to Pigs On The Wing, which makes the album seem like a cycle. Problem solved. What I love about this album is that it's a radical depature from the early days. Gone are the loose jams and psychedelic feel, replaced by something resembling rock theater. Hmmmn, rock theater? Sounds like our next album.heater? Sounds like our next album.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|CDs are awesome.  The live tracks on the bonus CD are worth the cost.  Bluesy and raw.  Listening to Adele it's hard to remember that she is only 19.  Sounds like the old jazz and blues of the 30s and 40s.
B000002U9W|3.0|Another strange album from Pink Floyd. Not that it's that bad, by any means, it's just that they still don't know what sound they want. This is Pink Floyd's peak as a progressive band, but Pink Floyd are not known for being progressive now, are they? They're known for being spacey and out there. This isn't that out there. Well, the title track definetly is. Written in collaboration with Ron Geesin, a avantgarde composer. The suite is fairly impressive to be perfectly honest, and it does paint the way for future epics, but it loses momentum after a while. The main theme is terrific, very epic sounding and paves the way for The Wall even. Gilmour contributes more solos on this album, which is fine by me, I love me some Gilmour solos. Breast Milky, the second part, is kinda cheesy but still listenable. But, the middle parts are crap. They don't merge with the earlier parts at all, and for the most part, are noisemaking. Bah, Floyd, no more noise! The second side is ok though. If is a good song, another folky one from Waters. Summer 68 is a bit clumsy sounding, no real direction, but it has a decent melody. Fat Old Sun is my favorite, a nice pleasant song about childhood with a ripping guitar solo from Mr. Gilmour. Yay. Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast is boring, 3 completly different parts once again making a big suite with no real substance. Oh well. Yet another mediocre Floyd album. However, it would take another year before things finally gelled.

B000002UA0|2.0|I might get flamed for this, but here goes:<br /><br />This album is gruesomely overrated. When it comes to 1967 psychedelia, there were much much better albums then this as great examples of the genre. Well, they had to start somewhere, didn't they? To begin with, I never thought Syd Barrett was a great songwriter or a great singer. Sorry folks. He liked to make some atonal noise when it came to doing solos, and there are only two kinds of songs on this album. One is the very messed-up astral jam, the other is the very messed-up nursery rhyme ballad. Syd was taking a LOT of acid at the time, and it definetly shows. First things first though, the good points on this album. Astronomy Domine is a great song. It's got a great mood of mystery, with a VERY echoey sound, which I don't know how they managed to get in 1967. And I do dig the main riff to Interstellar Overdrive, although the sound collage thing gets on my nerves. (You can see where this sound would be a blueprint to later glories though. Check out Echoes.) Also, some of the ballads are mellow and trippy. I dig Matilda Mother and Chapter 24, nice weird ballads that they are. However, the bad points really overshadow the good. There's too much \\"art sounds\\" on this album. Take Up Thy Stephescope and Walk is just godawful. It's just terrible noisemaking for 3 minutes. Also, Pow R. Toc H. is pretty bad too. Jazz piano followed by intolerable screaming. Bleh. Lucifer Sam has a good riff, but is followed by a forgettable melody. The album generally is pretty forgettable, and a little too messed up for my liking. Still though, you won't hear a Pink Floyd album quite like this. They had a long way to go before making good records.

B0001KZM3O|1.0|Yes, you heard me. A one. For many, this is the 'great lost' Pink Floyd album, the one people rarely think about but the one that proves to be quite a rewarding listen when you actually discover it. Nope. No such great wonder for me. What happened here is that Roger was totally and absolutely tired of the band, so that the title even sports the subscription 'by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd' And it definetly shows. There are NO contributions from Nick or David (save from some guitar solos that actually sound out of place), and the sound is generally the same. Slow, boring guitar strumming that all of a sudden gets loud with an orchestra and band banging out power chords, Roger screaming the lyrics at the top of his lungs, then back to barely audible. Repeat for 50 minutes. There is not even a single truly creative melody on the whole album. Roger mostly sticks to rudimentary piano chords or simplistic guitar lines that are so much in the background (the voice, on the other side, is mixed extremely high) that for the most part you don't notice them at all - and since there are no breaks between songs, I sometimes can't even grab the moment when one song becomes another. What happened? Where's the clever and attention-grabbing melodies that Roger created on The Wall? The lyrics, on the other hand, are quite good. This is yet another concept album. Here, Roger dedicates the album to the \\"post war dream,\\" making the Falklands war between Britain and Argentina a pretext for showcasing his views on the general problem of war and peace. The main idea is simple: the post-World War Two peace ideals have been betrayed, the war itself was fought for nothing, and the world is still ruled by Maggie (Thatcher), Brezhnev and Begin who don't value human life at all. Great concept, bad execution. Roger is not that good of a singer anymore with this one. He lacked the aggression and resonance that he had nearly spent on The Wall, and on this he tries too hard to hit some notes which he just can't sing anymore. Only a diehard Waters fan should pick this one up, or someone who wants to hear every David Gilmour solo. Avoid at all costs.s which he just can't sing anymore. Only a diehard Waters fan should pick this one up, or someone who wants to hear every David Gilmour solo. Avoid at all costs.

0060989157|5.0|This book is incredible!! I read it cover to cover. What I love about this book most is that it is written the way these guys would speak. For example, after every sentence Tommy writes, it finished with bro, or dude.   The stories written give you such a great insight as to how these men became some of the most notorious rockstars of all time. From their earliest memories growing up, til a few years ago. At times, it can be confusing as to what really happened as the stories are told from a few different points of view, but that further allows you to see who these guys are.  The advenutures and the (many, many, many) nights of debauchery, the numerous near death experiences and overdoses, the personal tragedies of each man. This book has it all. And in perfect, descriptive detail.  I wouldn't, however, recommend this book to people with a weak stomach, but to anyone else who has any interest in rock music and the lifestyle, I personally guarentee you won't be able to put this one down. I seriously can't describe enough how good this book is.

031606792X|1.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!    I was so excited for the 4th and final book of the twilight saga that I bought it from a borders in an airport because i had just got back from a vacation the day it came out.  I immediately started reading it and was at most liking it at first.  But then Bella became a nympho on her honeymoon and to top it off she got pregnant.  How does a vampire who can't even cry still produce sperm?? I couldn't believe that a character I felt I could relate to with the clumsy-ness and hate for the high school experience would go and get herself pregnant and not even think about the negative side to 1. being a teen mother and 2. keeping that creepy child she produced. Then half the book turned into Jacob's point of view and I couldn't have been more angry.  The books have always been in Bella's pov so why would SM change it up right in the middle?? The character's personalities all did a complete 180 in this book.  When would Edward have ever suggest that Jacob could impregnate Bella.  Weird much? And introducing all those new vampires and then they have no part was really a waste of time.  Also, Jacob imprinting on Bella's daughter. What the heck was that about.  Awkward much?  Stephenie Meyer should really  be disappointed in her self for such an awful story line.  This book held so much potential and she went and ruined it. I can't believe so many people on this site actually gave this book a 5 star rating.

I mean, I'm still gonna listen to the group. I'll stick pick up the next album. But none of these songs are very good. There aren't really any strong melodies<br /><br />Pete, you can do better! You played on Robyn's very good album Ole Tarantula for gods sake.<br /><br />I can't imagine someone picking up this album and loving it.

1563890410|4.0|The fourth Sandman collection finally follows up on the promise that Lucifer made to destroy Morpheus back in the opening collection. Destiny summons the Endless to a meeting, where we meet Delirium (who used to be Delight) for the first time and get some more information about the missing brother of the Endless. During the meeting Desire baits Dream about the treatment of his lover Nada, whom he banished to Hell for spurning him. Dream realises he/she is right, and resolves to travel to Hell and rescue his former lover, despite Lucifer's vow.    Season of Mists takes Dream on a journey into Hell and a confrontation with the Morningstar...but not the type of confrontation he was expecting. Dream ends up, slightly bemused, as the keeper of the key to Hell, and is soon being petitioned by gods and representatives from many pantheons (including the gods of Chaos and Order, and deities from the Egyptian, Norse and Japanese pantheons) anxious to get their hands on the finest plot of real estate in the multiverse, at the same time as he is also trying to find his missing love, and Death is attempting to repair the damage caused by countless legions of the dead suddenly being released back into the mortal world.    After the short story interlude of Dream Country, it's good to be back to a solid, long story arc. Although it's a reasonably long tale it's not the most dynamic story in the Sandman canon, and unusually most of it takes place in the Dreaming with only a few scenes set in the real world, and a longer chunk set in Hell. This allows us to see a bit more of the Dreaming and its inhabitants, but the meat of the story is seeing how the different pantheons interact together and who actually has the best claim on Hell.    As usual, Gaiman fills the story with neat little details and touches. The notion of there being a library in the Dreaming where all the books writers dreamed of writing but never got round to it is a fascinating one, and it's amusing to see books there such as Tolkien's The Lost Road (which was supposed to be a big story about his island kingdom of Numenor, but he abandoned it after a few pages). Elsewhere there are nods back to earlier stories: when Dream fears he may be destroyed in Hell, he decides to make time for a brief drink with his friend Hob Gadling, although they are not due to meet for another ninety-nine years. He also looks in on the newly-born son of Hector and Lyta Hall and gives him a name, Daniel, to Lyta's rage and horror. Elsewhere there's nice touches about the various gods, such as Chaos being personified as a young girl and Order as a carboard box, and Thor trying to impress some of the female deities present with his hammer, which gets bigger if you rub it (which is mythologically accurate)! Finally, we get a glimpse into the Sandman's collection of artefacts he has accumulated over the years, and see the skull of the Corinthian, a city trapped in a bottle and an old pocket watch, all of which are explored in future stories, in some cases years down the line.    As with previous collections, Gaiman interrupts the linear narrative of the story to give us a self-contained story in the middle of the collection which nevertheless comments on the action around it. A young boy left alone at boarding school for the holidays (after his father is among the hostages taken by Saddam Hussein in the build-up to the Gulf War) is suddenly joined by all those who died in the school over the previous century or so. It's a rather grim story, but ends on an interesting, optimistic note.    Season of Mists (****) isn't quite up there with the best of the Sandman collections. It is a tad overlong given its relative lack of actual incident, but for expanding our knowledge and understanding about Hell and the Dreaming, for introducing important new characters (particularly Daniel, Cluracan and Nuala) and for resolving the Nada storyline, it does a great job. The graphic novel is available from Titan in the UKand Vertigo in the USA, and forms the opening part of The Absolute Sandman, Volume II, available from Vertigo in the UK and USA.

0446401307|5.0|This current Harry Bosch offering by Michael Connelly is just as exciting as all his other Harry Bosch offerings. Michael is an expert in writing detective novels, as he was a Crime Reporter for the Los Angeles Times. Harry is a Detective for the Hollywood Special Homicide Division and his first case from being transferred from the Cold Case Unit, has him finding a body on the Overlook over Hollywood. With his young partner, Iggy, they, along with the FBI, attempt to track down the murderer of a Phycisist working with Cesium, a radioactive isotope used for treating ovarian -uteran Cancer. Along with murder, Harry is thwarted by the FBI, who wants Harry out of the loop, since a heist of this isotope by known terrorists makes this a National Security issue. With a few plot twists and turns, this makes for an outstanding who-donut. If you can handle the few bad words, this is a great novel. Since I was born and raised close to LA, there are places very familiar to me. If you want to learn more about how Homicide works and all the politics between the divisions and between the locals and the Feds, you'll enjoy this offering and the rest of the Harry Bosch books. Michael's new one with Harry comes out in a few days. I highly recommend this page-turner, as it takes you straight to the last page to resolve the case.

B001BGTWXI|4.0|and already, the Maggots are once again divided over Slipknot's latest effort. When Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses came out, I said it sucked after the first listen. It grew on me after awhile and this album is probably going be the same way. I remember reading an interview with band members and 6 said they were wanted to go into a more artistic mode like Pink Floyd. I love all types of music but I doubt most of the Slipknot fans would want that. This cd has some metal songs, the slow Stone Sour type songs, and it even contains songs with curse words. Is that just to make fans of the first two major studio albums happy? Upon placing the cd in the computer, it said this was a clean cd but I checked, and it wasnt. What can I say that has not already helped? It has a little of Corey's Stone Sour, a bit of Iowa thrown in, and more the same of Volume 3. It may take some time to get use to it. All hope is not gone for this band and I hope to catch them on tour in support of this album.

Corey has incorporated harmonizing vocals that haunt in such tracks as snuff, and bring some of the most aggressive lyrics and screaming he has ever done in Butcher's Hook and Gematria.

B000244EMO|4.0|The Ultimate Predator, battles the Ultimate Prey: The Human Race.    This is, in the smallest nutshell physically possible, the plot of the 80's sci-fi, action, horror film \\"Predator\\", from \\"Die Hard\\" director John Mctiernan. Now wait a second, from the director of \\"Die Hard\\"? then how come nobody ever seems to give this film a second thought? Sure everybody knows about the not-so-amazing Alien vs. Predator crossover, but the original Predator? Nah, you'd have to dig pretty deep to find somebody who remembers that.    For somebody who has never seen or even remembers the release of Predator, may be shocked to here that it earned a pretty good box-office and general critical reaction to the film was positive.    To be honest, I think that Predator is an overlooked gem that brings back some of that 80's, action film nostalgia that so many people unconciously strive to find. Though not on the same level as say \\"Terminator\\" or \\"Aliens\\", \\"Predator\\" is a classic in it's own right, many more recent films have subconciously borrowed from this movie. Many images, which have become iconic in modern cinema, actually have roots in Predator.    Predator is also one of those films that improves with age. It's almost refreshing to see an old style action movie that doesn't feel like a cliche, simply because it's one of those movies that has actually created those cliches to begin with.    If you're an action movie fan who loves Terminator, Die Hard, and Aliens then this movie is for you. If you're not really that type of moviegoer, I think Predator works well enough to actually make a space in your heart for this kind of film.

But I'm happy to report that The Incredible Hulk was every bit as good as Iron Man.  Maybe, in some small ways, even better.<br /><br />I was a huge fan of the Bill Bixy/Lou Ferrigno t.v. series, even though it bore little resemblance to the Marvel comic book.  But it was great entertainment, full of action, and a better-than-average peformance from Bill Bixby as Dr. David Banner.  Louis Letterier's big-screen reboot wisely takes a note (several notes, in fact) from the series, turning the film into a sort of \\"Fugitive\\" with gamma radiation.  There are several sly references to the t.v. show, including cameos by Ferrigno, the late Bixby, a young journalism student named Jack McGee, and for one brief nostalgia-laden moment. . .that aching, unforgettable piano theme which closed each episode.<br /><br />OK, fine, you say, what about the film itself?  Norton, who also co-wrote the script, handles his duties as Banner as well as can be expected.  I've never been a huge fan of Liv Tyler, but she's also well cast as Betty Ross (reportedly Norton wrote the part with Tyler in mind).  William Hurt overracts like mad as General Ross, who's probably the most \\"comic book\\" character in the film.  Well...no, Eli Roth's character becomes another rampaging creature, in a predictably CGI-heavy climax.<br /><br />Still, for all its occasional predictability and reliance on special effects, the film offers many fine moments.  The 2 or 3 big action set pieces are expertly-realized, with a standoff on a college campus standing out as one of the most memorable sequences.  And, like the Hulk of comic book origin, this Hulk can talk.  And although he's a creature of few words, I guarantee you'll remember each one.<br /><br />Although it was eclipsed by Iron Man in box office receipts, The Incredible Hulk was a solid hit, and is certainly a welcome addition to big-screen Marvel universe.  A closing cameo from Robert Downey Jr. ties the two films together neatly.  And you can bet we'll be seeing more Hulk on the big screen in the future.lk was a solid hit, and is certainly a welcome addition to big-screen Marvel universe.

B000FQ4M58|2.0|When you listen to this for the first time you'll know when Steinman's work kicks in without looking at the liner notes. At track 3, Steinman's exaggerated lyric and music kick in and for a minute you'll remember what is fun about the Bat Out of Hell series. Meatloaf sings well throughout, but only on the Steinman cuts do you find that ridiculous mix of faux operatic vocals and outrageous orchestration that made both he and Meatloaf famous. The rest is just a pastiche of the work that came before (but I do think the Dianae Warren contribution \\"Cry Over Me\\" works well for Meat) and pales in comparison. If you want to hear some more Steinman/Meatloaf this might be your last opportunity so take the good with the bad and skip over the other cuts.
031606792X|5.0|Meyers wrote an excellent ending for the Twilight series! I've read the book twice & am about to read it a third time. I can't wait for the movie!
B000005RS0|4.0|I was thrilled when this reissue was released with the 12\\" version of the hits. The 12\\" of What's Love Got To Do With It is fantastic, with that unique, special intro--I always thought that maybe the song was actually recorded this way and then edited down for the LP release, because this isn't just an 'extended' version looping specific parts of the song like 12\\" versions did at that time, but actually original material added to the original version.<br /><br />My only gripe is the fact that the 12\\" version of Better Be Good to Me, running just over 7 minutes, has edited about 30-40 seconds off the original 12\\" version!!! As of this writing, this 12\\" mix has never appeared on CD in its full running time!<br /><br />It would be great if Tina's two 80s follow-up LPs would also be reissued on CD with all the 12\\" versions as bonus tracks.
B00195BM3Y|5.0|If you are a fan of 80's rock/punk then this is a must have album. Almost every song is single-quality. Beginning with the rollicking 'Don't Fall' and concluding with the understated 'View from a Hill', each song has its own character and appeal. The lyrics, instrumentation and arrangements blend together seamlessly.   These guys played with U2 and other major bands back in the early 80's. Unfortunately, just when the band was coming to tour the US in 1987, they abruptly disbanded following the sudden death of band manager Tony Fletcher who died in a car accident in New York. There have been subsequent attempts to resurrect the band notably the 2002 release 'Why Call It Anything?'.
1400023343|5.0|As a specialist in bilingual and world languages education, I am always on the look for good resources to recommend to parents. Zurer Pearson's book is a solid, well-researched, practical and easy-to-read tool for all those interested in raising their children in more than one language. I particularly like the author's encouragement words and recommendations for parents who are not native speakers of the second language of their choice. This book would make an excellent gift for expecting and new parents. The earlier, the better!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This movie is really a present to the fans of SG1.  They had a larger budget than your typical TV movie, and it shows.  Also, since this movie ties up the rather twisted Ori story arch introduced in the final seasons of the show, it includes a nice overview of the situation so that new viewers can get some enjoyment out of it (albeit not nearly as much as fans who are familiar with the story).
B001BKXUOQ|1.0|I=ve been a fan of Slipknot since OO.At that time it was unlike anything I had heard.If someone asked me what metal is I would give them IOWA.I really looked forward to this release.If you've heard Psychosocial, you've heard the best song here.I can't defend them on this one.As a fan,I feel alienated.This is to Slipknot what Load was to Metallica,the beginning of the end.Wait until September 16th and buy All That Remains\\"Overcome\\".
1892005034|5.0|To me, Nonviolent Communication, the book, is a superb guide to healing, and life, helping me to be how I want to be in the world.  I had a hard time with the language the first time I read it, and I know that some of it could be said more beautifully, but I've read it several times now (the second time I read it I started with the last chapter, which worked better for me -- I find the first chapters read sort of like a commercial for NVC -- ), and given it to people.  Here's why:  When I read this book, I found an assertion -- all human beings, just like you, wish for their own well-being AND for others' well-being AND take joy in being able to contribute to others' well-being.  This is a core value or belief for me and I suspect that if you really can't accept that premise, the book would not be so useful and healing.  The book goes on to show examples of thinking that gets in the way of living this core value.  Most wonderful of all, it offers tools to help us live in accordance with our values.  Some of the tools are:  the idea that feelings point to met or unmet needs; the list of needs; the differentiation of needs from strategies to meet needs;  examples of how to find the feelings and needs in some common scenarios;  the insistence on separating observations from judgments; the idea of listening for the needs underlying a person's words; the explanation of feelings as having internal origin rather than being 'caused' by others, etc.  The huge steps I've taken in the past 3 years toward peace, self-acceptance, and realization of my potential seem to have come from attending workshops and classes based on this book.  When I re-read Nonviolent Communication, I find bits I missed the other times.  The chapter on self-empathy is particularly helpful on the problem of self-acceptance.  I always had a lot of trouble with the mantras of &#34;You deserve....&#34;,  &#34;You have a right...&#34;  Dr. Rosenberg helps me see all parts of myself, which helps me make choices that are aligned with all my values.
0345495004|5.0|I read this book for a book club that I am in.  It is very well written and a real page turner. It is a novel but the reader will feel that it is 100% true.  The only thing the reader needs to watch out for is I became so interested in the characters and I Googled them. It spoiled the story for me because I knew exactly what happened at the end.  It is fiction but very well researched and  not to be missed.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|Casper starring Bull Pullman and Christina Ricci is a childhood delight. I enjoyed this feel-good comedy as a young teen and still do. Ricci's performance is so under-stated, she can definitely hold her own. Pullman on the other hand is not a good actor but he's pretty believable in this film. Devon Sawa is such a babe in Casper, too bad his beautiful face doesn't show up 'til the end of the film. I highly recommend this ghostly caper, enjoy!
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I'm in my fifth month and bought 3 dvds - this one, Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1, and Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea.  I really love Erin's personality - she's upbeat, easy to follow, but not cheesy like many instructors.  And, it's a really good workout that is challenging and fun.  I definitely recommend it!
0393327345|5.0|A lot of the book is almost word for word like the movie, but the book expands on things that the movie didn't. There are some differences in the book. It's also pretty easy to read, I'm a very slow reader and I flew through this in about two days.
031606792X|1.0|It saddens me to say that I really hated this book.  I was such an avid fan of the first 3, and still am, I had many sleepless night cuz all I wanted to do was read these books. Was part of my let down the fact that I had to wait a whole year to read this, that I built something so fantastic in my head that I was bound to be let down?  Regardless, this was crap.  Spoiler alert.... does it creep anyone else out that Jacob imprinted on Bella's new born baby- eww.  The 200+ boring pages that led up to the \\"big\\" fight, was to long and ridiculously boring- and then amounted to nothing. Seriously, who cares about all those other vampires?  What a waste.  The whole time I was reading it, I just wanted it to be over- very sad.  That being said- I look forward to Mrs. Meyer possibly finishing her book regarding Bella from Edwards point of view.  I think that could be great!
B000YQSYSA|5.0|This album is a massive achievement by one of America's finest musician/poets. Tom Waits has slipped into some nether-zone where the voices of America mingle without restriction. Sharing the same fertile grounds with William Faulkner, Studs Terkel, Edith Wharton, Bob Dylan, Rickie Lee Jones, Robbie Robertson and others, the words and stories of these fifty plus songs are a primer for America.     Call it Americanism 101. Including blemishes, warts, wounds and scars, but featuring a depth and diversity breathtaking in its scale; Orphans is language and music as intelligence.    Much will be made of the many types and touchstones within the collection, but it's the accomplishment as a whole that impresses most. In the same way I listen to all of Highway 61 Revisited every time, almost paralyzed with awe by the last notes of Desolation Row, I listened to Orphans for eight hours the first day. I couldn't not listen: though the only one in the room the entire time, I was never alone.    Remember that glitchy hologram of John Coltrane in Vanilla Sky? Correct but not complete, captivating in concept but - well, imperfect. That's what Orphans is like.    A timeworn, sun-bleached mechanic from middle America pops up and talks about his cars; the Caddy, the Ford, the others - but he stops and chokes when he recalls the Pontiac. He loved that Pontiac.     Then he's gone and a Greek chorus of Tom Waits's is chanting Leadbelly's Goodnight Irene. \\"Everybody!\\" he yells at himself and then they're gone too. Replaced time and again by a voice from within a life somewhere in America, fifty more times.    It's an antidote to the media version of America - Fox and CNN and other conglomerates shine their gratuitous spotlight on the individual as - and only as - a particle in their proprietary media matrix. We must listen to the cheerleaders' views on Hillary because they reflect the wisdom of that channel. Not for their life alone.    Tom Waits is the exception - life alone is the basisof this set and it's good enough.     The outstanding track for me was The Road to Peace: a growling blues that sounds like it was recorded while stapled to a chair facing the news on a 14 inch television - conveying the equivalent miseries of Palestine, border Israeli towns, the settlements, tit for tat killings, the accidental incineration of a 3 year old - \\"we didn't know she'd be in the car\\". Why are we selling anybody bullets for this? asks the blues. It's a voice in touch with America right now - an imperfect pulse, with a heart.    It's an accomplishment that will live on. Recommended for anyone. Thank you Tom.
B000LC4TJ0|4.0|This is a modern version of the Marriage of Figaro.  It is quite different, but very interesting if you put aside what you've known about this opera and watch it as an opera you watch for the first time!?       All the singers have wonderful voice.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Shortened season or not, I think this is the best season of the series so far.   In previous seasons, the intrique of character flashbacks was beginnning to dim, but the intro. to \\"flash-forwards\\" brings a whole new dimension to the show, making it like a puzzle to find out what characters end up leaving the island.  The freighter is awesome, and definitely brings lots of action and suspense to the show (more than in any other season). The characters are all well drawn as usual, and the acting is great as always too. Typical of Lost, there are plot-twists and mysterious galore, and, also typical of Lost, not much of those mysteries are resolved. The main focus is more on the frieghter situation and how the \\"Oceanic 6\\" get off the island. That in itself keeps you watching episode after episode.    Plus, the season finale is the best three hours of television I have ever been graced to see in my life.
0385751532|1.0|As others said, the author really botched it with the main character: to imagine that any able-minded German 9-year-old, and a son of a high ranking SS commander to boot, would not have heard of Jews (and hated them) and would not know who the Fuhrer was, or how to pronounce it, is completely preposterous.     Furthermore, I found it offensive that the plot went as far as to suggest that two boys could have frequent conversations for almost a year along the unguarded fence. The Jewish boy would have been sent to the gas chamber upon arrival.     The result is a \\"Holocaust-lite\\" book that I find extremely objectionable.
0385339682|5.0|The Last Juror is a delightful story about Mississippi in the 1970s.  The characters are well developed and fascinating.  Don't miss it.
B001AP11KW|4.0|So, about a year ago, I bought a Zune for when I work out, and quickly realized that the 15 gigs I downloaded off my CDs were all bands from the 70's or early 80's and the music they're still doing; a very little bit of rap, but nothing from the last 2 decades.  So I had heard White Stripes on the radio, and bought Icky Stomp, and that led me to buying the rest of White Stripes cd's, most of which are great,  So when I saw that Jack White is past of Raconteurs, I bought them and really like this album a lot.    The punchline is that I was shopping in Safeway, and they were playing White Stripes on the sound system there.  So much for being hip!  But, what the heck---I do like th music, and I enjoy it.    Square Old Man!
B00026WU7I|5.0|Blood on the Tracks is Bob Dylan's artistic peak both lyrically and musically. Blood on the Tracks has aged gracefully. Dylan always gives us a sly wink, but particularly so on the autobiographical-sounding Tangled Up in Blue.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|\\"Papillon\\" is the apparently true story of Henri Charriere, the only person to successfully escape from Devil's Island off French Guiana. There is little argument that the real Henri was not a felon; he seems to have spent the majority of his formative years (and later) in and out of various prisons. The premise in \\"Papillon\\", however, is that he was sent away at that time for a crime that he did not commit. Regardless of the truth, the story is gripping and plausible, and well worth the time, though the movie is about a half-hour too long.<br /><br />Papillon is portrayed by Steve McQueen, in arguably the best performance of his career, certainly the role with the most emotional depth. I have always been a fan of McQueen's; I truly believe he was cheated out of an Oscar here, as he becomes Henri Charriere completely, weathering abysmal prison conditions and surviving by sheer will. He befriends fellow convict Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman, another great performance), a first-rate forger transported for defrauding the French Government with fake bonds. He is known to be wealthy, and therefore a target for assassins within the prison system (the method of retaining funds is gruesome; a tube inserted into the rectum of the prisoner for safekeeping) so Louis approaches Papillon for protection. This arrangement develops over time into a friendship, sometimes tenuous, but it works throughout the movie, as the two convicts go through atrocious events together.<br /><br />The film seems to span long years; at least two long solitary confinements for Papillon for escape attempts; and goes very in depth about the nature of the prison system, its priveledges and punishments, and the manner of survival in almost any situation you could dream up. The French Colonial prison system was a model of barbarism, and its remains can still be seen on various islands; it is something of an irony, however, that the islands purported to be inescapeable and therefore not guarded that closely (the sea was full of sharks which were considered to be enough of a deterrent to escape attempts)are now resorts. If you have enough cash now, you can sit on Dreyfus's Bench yourself.<br /><br />This was a great movie; not perhaps to everyone's taste, but a harrowing film nonetheless, with wonderful performances by McQueen and Hoffman. There is also a great score by Jerry Goldsmith, which perfectly complements the action in the film.l of sharks which were considered to be enough of a deterrent to escape attempts)are now resorts.

031606792X|4.0|I would not go as far as some of the others saying it was a crappy book just because it did not end they way they wanted it to.      Even though is was not as good as the other 3 I still could not put it down.  I don't think the ending was all that bad.   She decided to go the happily ever after route and nothing is wrong with that.      Its a good read just the same.
0783225857|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a powerful, hugely well-acted film that should be on everyone's Top Ten and should be in every film collection. The book took me for a ride as a child, one of those rare books we were made to read in school that I could not put down; the film, with exemplary performances by Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Brock Peters, is a searing treatise on social mores of the time and it still speaks to us today. We have not come all that far from the era portrayed in the film, and it should be shown in schools; it is that good.<br /><br />Scout (Mary Badham), a precocious child, runs pretty much unchecked through the small Southern town in which she is raised, tolerated by the townsfolk because her father is Atticus Finch, a well-respected attorney; and really, she is looked upon with affection by most, who feel sorry for her because her mother died. She only has time to ruminate on that occasionally, as she and her older brother Jem, and a visiting boy there for the summer, get into all sorts of adventures against the backdrop of her father's preparing to defend a local black man on trial for the alleged rape of a young white woman. There are those in town who can smell a frame clearly enough, but this is the South, and a charge brought by a white against a black is going to have dismally predictable results. Atticus, who knows his client is innocent, forges ahead anyway, facing down intimidation and threats to his children, and building up the film to a crescendo of an ending. The ending of the movie - and scattered references throughout the film - introduced us, also, to Robert Duvall, as he just began his film career; and though his part is small, it is wrenchingly powerful.<br /><br />The highest recommendation possible. Everyone should own this movie, in whatever form you can get it.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|I think some people are complete idiots in this world!  Just listen to these reviews, \\"It's not s/t or Iowa\\" \\"It sounds like stone sour.\\"  Come on people, give it a rest!  I really hate reading these reviews because I hate to have to listen to stupid people.  First of all, it is not stone sour pt. 2 as some idiot said.  There are only 2 people from stone sour in this band, which I might add if anyone is to blame for wanting a stone sour sound, its slipknot them selves because they wanted to recruit Cory Taylor.  they took him from his roots and now he is singing the way that he has always felt comfortable singing like.  Its not degrading, it maturing.  You forget, there are 7 other people in the band besides the 2 from stone sour, and they are all dictating in which direction they want to go and the way they want to sound.  And together ALL 9 MEMBERS have decided this is the sound they want and what they want to do!  So to say this is stone sour pt. 2 is absolutely ridiculous and insane.  This is Slipknot and this is how Slipknot wants to sound.  And to my next point, the sound they have chosen is a sound of maturing.  Are you all living in '99?  Did you really expect for all their albums to sound the same?  Cause if you did, your one of the stupid people I hate!  Almost all bands have changed there sound a little while experimenting and maturing together as individuals and as band members and they all have gone through there period where people where like whoa, that is nothing like their first album!  And that is great!  Its means they are maturing.  Exploring different aspects of their band and their sound.  I'm glad slipknot is changing.  It shows a growth in their abilities as a band and as individuals.  And they do it in such a great way with out \\"selling out.\\"  Its a beautifully written CD and for anyone who is not stupid enough to believe thing will never change will enjoy this CD.  This is for people who can appreciate a maturing musical band, not a band stuck in a shock rock roll for America.  For those of you who cant get past the fact the band is growing and moving forward while you are stuck in the path, that is actually a good thing.  Don't ever buy a slipknot CD again and don't buy tickets to their shows again.  You will just be one more idiot I don't have to look past while enjoying their music!
0345495004|1.0|This book came highly recommended and from all the reviews, many have enjoyed it.  Maybe it was all the hype that set such an unattainable benchmark, but I think it was the story itself that failed for me.  As a woman, a wife and a mother - most especially a MOTHER, I had such a difficult time relating to Mameh.  I just couldn't fathom the choices she made and in the manner in which she chose to excuted them.  Her utter disregard for her responsibility to her children was absolutely disgusting!!!  This book was such a waste of time.
1401216676|5.0|One of the best graphic novels of all time. I Had to purchase it again after giving it away as a gift. The artwork is superb, as is the story. I recommend the hardcover edition for the collectors.
0375805613|5.0|I used to read this book to my own children and bought this copy for my grandchildren.  The book is still as much fun for the grandchildren as it was for my children -- and the best part is I get to watch my children enjoy reading it to their children!

B00180R06I|3.0|This is a review of the Criterion Vampyr release. I will not review the film itself, but just a few comments on the quality. I have no other version of Vampyr to compare, but generally speaking this version is only so-so in terms of quality (as compared to, say, a 1930 hollywood film). It is all in soft focus, which seems to be unavoidable, and the outdoor scenes are very soft focus indeed, but apparently intentionally. All of this is fine, and the overall effect is good and creepy. However, the entire film is running at too fast a speed. For the most part, the characters themselves are moving slowly so the fast speed isn't too apparent or intrusive, but any scene involving energetic motion is far, far too fast- simply jogging, walking quickly, or the brief scuffle between the doctor and Mr Gray are almost comically too fast. I know some directors undercranked the camera for certain effects, but this entire film is transferred at too fast a speed. An amazing mistake for Criterion. Also, the outdoor scenes seem not to have been restored at all, with a LOT of flicker, inclusions and scratches in nearly all of those scenes. So, do not expect the sort of miraculous restoration that Nosferatu got in the Kino Ultimate Edition. From what I've read, this Criterion Vampyr is a major upgrade from what was previously avaiable, but it certainly could have been better than this.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|Opeth's album, Still Life, is their most pivotal album ever created. This cd opened the door to their memorable career. The sound quality of it always suffered, that is until it was just recently remastered. I've owned Still Life for years and to hear this new edition allowed me to open my eyes and ears again. The clarity is definitely on the up and up and no longer possesses that raw sound that the original cd had so much of. I love it.     I definitely recommend this cd to anyone who is an Opeth fan such as me. If you're pondering buying your first Opeth album, this cd is a must! Great starting plateau for this band.
B001BGTWXI|1.0|First of all I have been a Slipknot fan since the inception. I have all their albums and have been to countless shows. This album is pretty weak. If you are expecting the hardest album ever (what the band promised) then my friend you will be deeply disappointed. I mean there is a ballad on this CD!!! I have never wanted to wave a lighter in the air at a Slipknot concert. That's when you know they have lost their edge!     On a side note if this was a Stone Sour album it would be great. I just hold Slipknot to a higher standard that's all. But if you enjoy long walks on the beach and holding hands in the park then this album is for you!!!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The extras:  The season 2 box offers more subtititles (English, French, Spanish, Portugese and Chinese) than the first box which only had French, Spanish and Portugese subtitles. You get another hilarious Gag reel which shows Jensen and Jared's funny side. Great commentaris on 3 episodes and a good \\"Making of\\" of the season finale. The only improvement I would suggest is more commentaries and more interesting unaired scenes.     The episodes:  From the 22 episodes I love 18 which is pretty good number for a picky person like me. The 2nd season offers more great episodes dealing with a greater variety of topics(love, revenge, family, classic rock,self-sacrifice, time  etc.). SPN is certainly no X-files(I'm no Mulder & Scully fan) but a show that tries to tell the story of two brothers on a roadtrip which hunt a few supernatural creatures on their way to a \\"normal\\" family life. You can watch episodes like \\"Tall tales\\", \\"hollywood babylon\\" or \\"What is and never should be\\" as stand-alones but I would recommend watching the episodes in the right order, otherwise it could be confusing. It's certainly difficult to understand everything without the knowledge of season 1.     The actors:  Every episode focuses a little bit more on one of the two brothers,so if you enjoy TV-series with many re-occuring actors and a huge character crew, SPN is certainly the wrong show. The recipe of the series is focusing on Dean & Sam Winchester (Jensen Ackles, Jared Padelicki) with the appearances of many great guest stars (Jeffrey Dean Morgan,Jim Beaver, Frederic Lane, Samantha Ferris, Sterlin K. Brown, Chad Lindberg etc).    I own season 1 & 2 but the second is certainly my absolute favorite. Soemthing which sets this show apart from others is the great use of Classick Rock music (CCR, Foreigner, REO, Kansas, Boston, Lynards Skynyrd etc.).
B00008EY9G|5.0|You have to watch this movie more then once to get the actual greatness of it! I love it!! Right down to the end you are nervous for the people & rooting for the others... without giving too much away lol. I highly recommend it!!

031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn was this summer's most anticipated novel. The fourth and final book in the Twilight saga definitely created anticipation that vaguely resembled Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but what it failed to deliver was both quality and satisfaction. The end of a series shouldn't leave a taste of both disgust and anger, but rather a feeling of completion. Rather than feeling that this series had a clean finish with every character getting some face time, Breaking Dawn gives you a whole new slew of characters that are briefly introduced but never explained which doesn't help the reader stay connected with the characters that they have grown to love. The fact is that the main characters in the Twilight series are barely recognizable in Breaking Dawn, to the point where only the names are similar.<br /><br />And then we come to another point: (spoiler alert) Reneesme: the mutant spawn. She is part vampire, part human, and part glorified teenage pregnancy pro-life agenda. Here are a few of the biggest issues I have with this horrible, poorly written fanfiction product:<br /><br />1. Since when did Bella ever want to have a child? If I remember correctly wasn't she against, scratch that, terrified of the idea of ever becoming a country hick knocked up by her boyfriend? I guess Stephanie was trying to make the reader sympathize with Bella, trying to get us to understand that an entire perspective can be changed the moment that a \\"woman\\" realizes she is pregnant. But what she forgot is that Bella is only 18, and that teenage pregnancy is never an easy change, which brings me to my next point...<br /><br />2. The undertones of glorifying teenage pregnancy. In the Twilight world Bella has a completely secured relationship, she also has a lot of money, a doctor for a father in law, and a ton of resources at her disposal. In the real world she would have been in a completely different situation, and it wouldn't nearly of been so welcome. I am definitely not saying that the gruesome birth scene was what glorified the pregnancy, no, it was pretty clear on its intent to disgust. But that still doesn't change the fact that Stephanie Meyer had ulterior motives with her not so subtle pro-life message, especially strong at the moment that Edward says to get rid of it, and Bella (being the maternal mature mother) freaks out about him calling the \\"baby\\" a thing.<br /><br />3.  Subtle implications of pedophilia are found in Breaking Dawn with Jacob imprinting on the newborn mutant spawn that is Reneesme. What happened with Leah? There was a lot of very strong character development in the second book. Leah became a character I was really starting to appreciate as a welcome distraction from the story line that the Cullen's had picked up. There was a possibility of Jacob being with Leah, happy and content, and then bam, Leah is gone... hello day old baby. The strong character that was being developed with Leah ended abruptly and was never mentioned after book two except in passing. If Stephanie Meyer were a good writer she wouldn't have abandoned a character like that.<br /><br />4. No fight scene between the Volturi and the variety of vastly unexplained characters. Throughout struggling through the entire book, I had hoped for at least a really cool fight scene, one where everyone was in grave danger, maybe a few main characters are killed off, but alas... no fight scene. Stephanie Meyer took the lazy author route, she wrote a cop out scene, and the only character who died was one that had maybe about 2 pages of actual face time. Irina who???<br /><br />5. Who was Bella? Not only did Stephanie throw a whole new slew of unexplained characters at us, she also took all of her characters that we had all fallen in love with and related to and made turned them into something unrecognizable. In the three preceding books to Breaking Dawn, Bella had had an extremely endearing quality about her, she was young and in love for the first time. She wasa character that most girls related to and one that we all understood. In Breaking Dawn, Bella is twisted from innocent and clumsy, to this character who resembles, well, not Bella. Her dialogue in the book resemble that of a really bad romance novel that takes place during Victorian era. She just isn't the same character, even at the beginning of the book.<br /><br />6. What happened to Alice? Really, where was she?<br /><br />7. There was a huge lack of face time for all of the Cullens. I honestly expected Breaking Dawn to give a background to the rest of the Cullens, but instead the only character that was more than fully explained to me was a character I didn't even care about (Reneesme).<br /><br />To be fair I never thought that these books were of any merit when it came to writing style, I had always considered them to be along the same lines as some online fan fiction, except published. They were simply nowhere near the caliber that was the Harry Potter series, but they were fun to read (with an exception to Breaking Dawn) and Stephanie Meyer had an uncanny ability to make the reader want to know what happens next (which is her only strong point as a writer). Because her entire series was based on that, it makes it so much worse for the reader when the whole dynamic of the story are flipped on its back and run over with a car.<br /><br />I am extremely offended when Stephanie Meyer claims that she simply can't please everyone. She should tell that to the over 500 bad reviews, and not to mention the thousands of disappointed fans.<br /><br />Thank you Stephanie for curing my obsession with Twilight...a character that most girls related to and one that we all understood. In Breaking Dawn, Bella is twisted from innocent and clumsy, to this character who resembles, well, not Bella.

B000QQFKYE|4.0|David Lynch is a true cinematic genius. That said, I will say that this is not his strongest work, but that doesn't mean this film is bad, or not worth the time. Quite the contrary. I just simply walked out of the theater thinking that it could have been about 30 minutes shorter. But even if this film misfires a little. It is still way more interesting engrossing than 90 % of all the films that come out today. If you where new to David Lynch I would probably reccomend \\"Mullholland Drive\\" to you. But those who are already familiar will want to own \\"Inland Empire\\".
B001BKXUOQ|1.0|this was not what I was expecting from what was a talented band... i'm highly disappointed after 4 years we get this garbage.
B0013D8LOK|2.0|The desaturated Gothic graphics are stunning.  Which they should be, since Tim Burton's been honing his ability to portray them for fifteen years.  Perhaps he should try sepia tones instead of desaturation for his next film.<br /><br />The performances were good - but there were two tragic flaws that kept this from being a good film.  The first was the plotting.  Although this is supposedly a story about Mr. Todd, his character is stagnant, an iconic force of revenge.  All of his change has already taken place offstage.  The most change he goes from is \\"Kill a few select people\\" to \\"kill everyone\\" - and that change happens in a most contrived and unsatisfying way.  Helena Bonham Carter's character, however, does change - but her storyline, her conflicts are glossed over to provide more time for the supposedly \\"main\\" storyline.  This would have been a much better story had it been told from her character's viewpoint, centering on her conflicts and internal struggles on what - and whom - to serve.<br /><br />The second flaw is, unfortunately, the main trope of the story.  The songs.  With only two exceptions - both duets involving Helena Bonham Carter's character - the songs do little to advance the story or show character.  They are set pieces that simply exist for thier own sake.  This would be forgivable if they were memorable - but they're not.  Every line - sung or not - must advance the plot or show character.  Too many lines - both sung and not - are instead included simply to exist, and it shows.<br /><br />In short, this film adaptation of the musical would have been a hundredfold better had it shed the music and used that time to instead explore the characters within it.  Would it still be an adaptation of the musical?  Perhaps not, but it would have been a lot better story.
0439023483|5.0|I didn't really have high expectations for The Hunger Games.  The blurb sounded interesting, but you never can tell with young adult fiction, particularly in the science fiction genre.  Trust me:  I've been burned before.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find a compelling story with a strong, realistic protagonist.  I didn't always like Katniss, but I understood what motivated her to take the actions she did.  The story is nothing new -- comparisons to [[ASIN:156931778X Battle Royale]], [[ASIN:0451197968 The Running Man]], and even [[ASIN:0791098265 William Golding's Lord of the Flies (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations)]] are all valid, but Collins's story is well-crafted, and it was difficult to put this book down.  When I reached the end, I was both pleased and dismayed to find that this was the first in a series.  Pleased because Katniss's story isn't over; dismayed because I will have to wait for the rest!

0385340990|5.0|I was first intrigued by the title of this novel.  I became further intrigued when I saw it listed as one of the must-read titles at this year's Book Expo America.  I was a bit discouraged when I discovered the book was an epistolary novel, as I tend not to enjoy this format.  However, I quickly became engrossed in the story, and could not put it down until it was finished.  I began the novel Thursday evening, and finished it in the wee hours of Friday morning.<br /><br />The Guernsey Island characters are what kept me reading.  I have to confess that I didn't like the central character, London writer Juliet Ashton, very much when I started reading, but when she started exchanging letters with Dawsey Adams, my interest quickened.  As more Guernsey characters were introduced, I quickly fell under their spell, just as Juliet did.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|The first time I heard No Other I was totally blown away. Mind bending lyrics, beautiful melodies, and, possibly, the most overblown production ever. Acoustic guitars, electic guitars, slide guitars, steel guitars, pianos, organs, synthesizers, violins, harmonicas, horns, strings, gospel choirs, country harmonies, all in support of Gene Clark's fabulous baritone voice. This is one of those recordings where the listener can hear something different each listen, because there is so much going on. Despite this over the top production, it all fits rather perfectly together, never swamping the melodies or Clark's vocals, or obscurring Clark's beautiful lyrics. Indeed, the complex production genuinely enhances the countrified/zen (partially LA cocaine induced) philosphical lyrics. No Other compares with Sgt Pepper, Quadrophenia, and All Things Must Pass as among the most complex and important productions in rock history. (I would rate No Other as only slightly behind Sgt. Pepper and ahead of the other two albums). Generally, I prefer the simpler, more personal productions, but in this case, the complex production works great. And, as the stripped-down bonus tracks vividly illustrate, the songs are pretty terrific too. It's got everything AND the kitchen sink. One of the very best albums ever.
B000301YY8|4.0|I actually listened to his second album, 'All the lost souls' before this one and while both are wonderful, I like the second one slightly better. However, 'Back to Bedlam' certainly has it's charming and poignant moments.    James Blunt's voice is hypnotic and depressingly beautiful, he has no equal when it comes to angst-ridden melodies and his anguish-filled voice is mesmerising. He sounds incredibly sincere when he sings.    'You're beautiful'- Overplayed but a wonderful single.   'High'- wonderful beginning and has a great range- one of my faves on this CD  'Goodbye my Lover'- THE best song on here. Utterly depressing and gorgeous. There are not enough words...  'Cry'- Lovely, lovely song.  Again, that voice is used to great effect.  'Tears and Rain'- Stirring and passion-filled.     The other songs are also very good, those 5 are just my faves on the album. He really is a breath of fresh air. While others may consider him 'whiny', and I can somewhat understand what they mean, I just don't see it as that. I guess it is a matter of opinion, but I am completely infatuated with him.

B000I2IT44|5.0|This DVD has everything you may wish for. I have successfully managed to get numerous friends interested in Porcupine Tree just by showing them some songs from this DVD.     Production is excellent, with fantastic audio in stereo or surround (except for \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" in the stereo mix, which unfortunately has the vocals mixed a bit too far to the background), and interesting live footage treatment by Lasse Hoile that adds to the atmosphere.    The band is in excellent shape and performs some of their best material of the time mixed with daring and great re-interpretations of older material. Especially \\"Hatesong\\" is mind-bogglingly excellent.    If you like Porcupine Tree, this is a must-have that you will never regret buying. If you don't know Porcupine Tree yet, you may start liking them based on this DVD.
B001BKXUOQ|3.0|This album is ok, it kind of drives back into background noise after so long. I have been a slipknot fan since 2001 and have felt that they started out good, infact \\"wait and bleed\\" is still my favorite song by them either that or \\"(sic)\\", and have made a downward spiral ever since, this peaked a bit with subliminal verses, but then died quickly, much like this album. It produces a decent Slipknot sound but at 99 calories of the original 5000 calorie cd.

0446402389|4.0|Begin with a rich, flavorful broth (beef, chicken, or, for those on a budget, cat) detailing Stalin-era Russia. Immediately add one MGB officer torn between duty to the State (who mandates there are no such thing as murderers) and an innate duty to find the serial killer who \\"doesn't exist\\".    Slowly stir in:  One estranged wife  44 creepy child murders (diced)  One deranged child murderer  One cat (the skinnier the better)    Let simmer. Skim often for clues. and cat hair.    This stark look at communist Russia was an absolute delight to read. I have never learned so much from a book nor been so immersed in a time period.    Tom Smith nails all the details, from cannibalism to unapologetically bleak violence to Leo's internal struggle as he realizes that Stalin's regime and the \\"worker's paradise\\" is fundamentally flawed.    From the first sentence--\\"Since Maria had decided to die her cat would have to fend for itself\\", I was hooked.    If Smith had chosen to simply write a historical novel, I would be impressed. With the addition of a mystery/thriller, using communist Russia as a stunning backdrop to darker deeds, he creates a literary work of art.     There are no glaring plot holes, the book moves along at a good speed, there are great plot twists, and Smith's writing is elegant, to say the least.    I was particularly impressed with the fact that I didn't see the ending coming from miles away. I pieced it together bit by bit, but I was still (occasionally) taken by surprise-big points to Smith!    This one rates a 8/10.    I look forward to Ridley Scott's interpretation.

B0018O4YT0|4.0|I believe Dark City to still be one of the greatest sci-fi movies around, and despite having seen it innumerable times, I still find new ideas and concepts emerging from the rich material.  Like many people, I've owned the standard edition for years, but felt compelled to buy the Director's Cut when it was released.<br /><br />Not only does the Director's Cut have added footage, but scenes are rearranged, extended, and subtly modified in terms of visuals, which have been retouched, and music.  The opening narration has been removed, plot points are made clearer, and there is a little more depth to several characters.  And yet, I can't completely recommend the DC.  A lot of the scenes added feel unnecessary, and with the extended and added footage, the pace is more slack and the movie doesn't pack as much punch to me.  For instance, the second song Jennifer Connelly sings was severely abridged in the original cut; here, the song is presented in full form, and while it's entertaining, it derails the movie for a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The original DVD [[ASIN:0780622553 Dark City (New Line Platinum Series)]] was a flipper disc housed in a paperboard snapper case; the DC is in a standard Amaray plastic DVD case, is one-sided, and is housed in a paperboard sleeve with embossed lettering.  In addition, it includes an insert that provides a code you can use to download a digital copy of the movie, although I'm not sure if the digital copy is the standard or DC edition.<br /><br />This edition gets four stars because, while it's still a wonderful movie, I prefer the original cut, and with that cut going out of print, it should've been included with this cut on the DVD (maybe as a 2-disc edition).  As a note, the Blu-Ray edition [[ASIN:B0018O4YSQ Dark City (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]]] contains both cuts.
B00000583F|5.0|All I can say is that Black Sabbath are my favorite band of all time and they don't come close to achieving what Sleep does on this album in terms of sheer heaviness, with exceptions being \\"Electric Funeral\\",    \\"Snowblind\\" and maybe \\"Into the Void\\".  If you don't believe me check it for yourself.  This album will plaster a scowl to your face and you will like it.

0743289692|5.0|This is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read. Ayaan Hirsi Ali gives a detailed portrayal of her life story and growing up Muslim. All that she writes about will stay with you and will make you think.   Her amazing life journey had me taken through several countries and through a culture as a woman I could have never in my wildest dreams knew existed.  I had heard about female genital mutilation, but I never truly knew of the real horrors of it. I could also never imagine a mother telling her child to hit before you are hit as a survival of the fittest strategy. Alot of things she writes about are not what we in the westernize world are taught, and it seems very foreign to the point of culture shock.   Please pick up the book and read it with an open mind. I can definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about the struggles of women around the world.
B001DHXT20|5.0|After the incredible letdown of The Hulk, this movie had so much going against it that I don't see how it ever got off the ground. Still, I'm glad some executive somewhere saw the potential in this character and decided to give it another shot. This one had a lot more action than the first, and the Hulk actually talked! Very nice!<br /><br />What was weird was how this movie paid homage to the first film in a lot of ways, yet still managed to stay as its own. I can't say I was stoked to hear that Edward Norton would be taking over as Bruce Banner, but he managed to turn in a great performance. That final scene in the cabin was absolutely incredible in setting the stage for future movies.<br /><br />While this one made the least amount of money of the \\"Big Three\\" (Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, and The Dark Knight), I still think it was a nice addition to the Summer.<br /><br />What Worked:<br /><br />* We saw the hero in the first 15 minutes of the film! For some reason, Ang Lee thought we were paying good money to see a movie call \\"The Hulk\\" but we didn't really want to see the big green guy, so he held out for the first hour before bringing him in. Bad move.<br /><br />* Action! Yes, we saw the inner struggle of Bruce Banner, but there was smashing in this one! The Hulk/Abomination fight was just like you'd imagine a real comic book smackdown to be like. He fought the army and the bad guy, and looked cool. I think Lou Ferrigno was a great guy, but his Hulk never jumped through the city at high speeds, or clapped out a fire. And yes, I know the Hulk looked like a video game character, but it's still better than getting some professional wrestler to wear green body paint for an hour!<br /><br />* Iron Man! To have a cameo like that from a movie that came out a month earlier was a home run! It helped build on the stinger from Iron Man, but they gave it to us before the credits this time.
0060837551|5.0|I absolutely love this story. I first saw the mini series, and then read this book.   The story is about a love that is not quite unrequieted but certainly forbidden. Meggie Cleary falls in love with a priest, and he with her. But as you will find in the book Meggies loves the priest more because his relationship to God always comes first. I would say he is a man of great honour though some might say he is a coward. He always makes sure she is taken care of, but he never quite gives of himself totally to her.  The one thing striking about the priest is that he seems to be the perfect man in all things, and the kind of man that no woman could resist. The only thing that keeps him from totally giving himself to a woman whole heartedly is his relationship with God. Like I said before he is a man of honour, but some might say a coward for what seems like leading Meggie on. I do truly believe he loves her, but his honour of the committment he made to God gets in the way every time.    Read the book and enjoy a beautiful but sad love story.

B001AJVR5M|5.0|This has to be my favorite album from them! All of the songs are great and I listen to them everyday. Most of their songs are a little slower that they usually are, so that did take one or two listens to get used to. But, ALL of the songs on this CD are great!!     BB' Good: has a nice beat and really wants to make you get up and move. The lyrics are great also.     Burnin Up: Is just the best!! I love that song!!! I have the music video on my ipod. One of my favorite songs off of this CD!!! I have this song in my head all of the time.    Shelf: Is also another great song. Talking about girls who don't really pay attention to a guys feelings. Nice, sweet song.    One Man Show: Steals the show!! Very nice beat!! Saying that he will be fine alone because he is a \\"One Man Show\\"!    Lovebug: My favorite!! So, so sweet and has a great sound to it. Makes you feel like you are at the beach. It starts off a little slow, and them speeds up to the Jonas Brothers tempo. I have this song in my head all of the time too.    Tonight: Song about how we aren't going to work this out tonight. Or maybe we will? Really sweet.    Can't Have You: Is really sad to me! It's about how they are coping with their break-up. It's still a very nice song to listen too.    Video Girl: Has a great, get up and dance beat! I have that song in my head all of the time. Great song to listen to at any time.    Pushin' Me Away: Joe really kinda sings this by himself and does a great job. One of my favorites. Nice lyrics, like all of their songs.    Sorry: Another semi sad song. It's really sweet though. I love listening to all of their songs, even it's its sad.    Got Me Going Crazy: One of my top 5 favorites!! GREAT beat and talks about true love. A favorite.    A Little Bit Longer: Save the best for last. So sweet, makes you want to cry. A song about Nick and his diabetes, saying how he will need to go \\"A little bit longer\\" and he will be fine. This is a great song for anyone at anytime when they are going through a tough time or anything like that.     Overall, I totally give this album 5 stars!!!!

B001EN71DG|2.0|If you've already purchased any of the movies in this set, you could sell them to buy this set, but why? The Original Trilogy might be worth buying for a beginner, but that's about it. The new Special Editions still have messed up colors, and will ruin the nostalgia for long-time fans with the CGI and nonsense.    See the \\"So you'd like to...\\" list entitled: \\"own the Star Wars movies on DVD and not double dip\\" for details...      Both the Star Wars Trilogy and Prequel Trilogy box sets are simply all the previously released official DVD sets (the Prequels from '01, '02, and '05; and the Original Trilogy Limited Edition sets from '06) packed into cardboard. You won't be getting the 2004 \\"Bonus Materials\\" disc that came with the first (4 disc) 2004 box set (thankfully you can order that separately on amazon for cheap).    As there is no new content on either of these sets, it's pointless except for people who want all the movies and don't have them yet.    When I initially posted this review, it was somewhat cheaper to buy the individual Limited Edition sets, but now this one is slightly cheaper (about $4 less). So it makes sense as a purchase if you want to own all the (sub-par) DVDs and don't already own any of them.
0060557818|2.0|I watched the superb Hellboy Golden Army film while I was reading this so so novel, and it really hammered in my dissatisfaction with this book. This occured because of the wonderful underground world that was created in Hellboy if not by Del Toro, then the person who wrote the original graphic novel. The whole London Underground thing which ties the names of tubestops to characters is absurd and ridiculous.  Imagine if Neil Gaiman were not a household name (sort of) but a first time novelist trying to pitch this story to Tor publishing.  He would be thrown out within seconds.  Luckily Gaiman has a wonderful imagination and is a gifted writer so all is not lost.  But lame is really the best word I can come up with to describe the whole plot.  I loved American Gods and Stardust, but Gaiman is definitely hit and miss in my book.
B001EN71DQ|2.0|If you've already purchased any of the movies in this set, you could sell them to buy this set, but why? This set isn't quite as pointless as the \\"Original Trilogy\\" companion set (which marks the third virtually identical content box set of the Star Wars Special Edition trilogy in the last four years), because the Prequels were previously only available separately.   The trouble is that these are just not good films compared to the originals. Unlike \\"Star Wars\\" \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" which flow together fairly well... Episode I just feels pointless now, with its slow, meandering plot involving taxes, silly droids and doofus politicos, the slapstick Roger Rabbit clone Jar Jar Binks, and an overly long Pod Racing sequence stolen from Hanna Barbara. Episode II begins to finally heat things up towards the third act, and Episode III is passably decent (at its best approaching the quality of Return of the Jedi). However, as a trilogy, this set simply leaves a lot to be desired.  The casual fan would be better served purchasing Episode III, and renting I and II just to see what Lucas was into before he finally went back to the \\"real backstory\\" he'd written for the Original Trilogy in the late 70's and early 80's. Despite it's flaws (some truly atrocious acting and rushed wrap up with many loose ends still unaddressed), Episode III is the best of the lot. Many fans have wondered what it would be like to \\"watch them all in numerical order.\\" Trust me, I've tried it, and it's not as fun as it might sound. Episode I and the first half to 2/3rds of Episode II simply drag, making it seem like an eternity before we start to get to \\"the good parts.\\"  The best thing about the Prequels is that it reminds us that there are three far better movies that were made between 1977 and 1983 which inspired them.   As for these new box sets... how many times can Lucas re-release the same movies on DVD?  The Original Trilogy might be worth buying for a beginner, but that's about it. The new Special Editions still have messed up colors, and will ruin the nostalgia for long-time fans with the CGI and nonsense.  See the \\"So you'd like to...\\" list entitled: \\"own the Star Wars movies on DVD and not double dip\\" for details...  Both the Star Wars Trilogy and Prequel Trilogy box sets are simply all the previously released official DVD sets (the Prequels from '01, '02, and '05; and the Original Trilogy Limited Edition sets from '06) packed into cardboard. You won't be getting the 2004 \\"Bonus Materials\\" disc that came with the first (4 disc) 2004 box set (thankfully you can order that separately on amazon for cheap).  As there is no new content on either of these sets, it's pointless except for people who want all the movies and don't have them yet.  But for the price, you can own them for a few dollars less separately. If you think it's worth a few extra bucks for cardboard, please feel free to make George a little richer...  PS: Since my review has apparently angered some... the main reasons for the low rating are primarily because I feel that two out of the three movies are relatively poor, and as a trilogy, they don't work very well together, and because this set is simply a rehash of previous releases. First time fans are better off renting Episode III if they really want to see the best the Prequels have to offer. For everyone else, the Original Trilogy is far superior.

B000NSJ4Q0|4.0|This pack really helps to extend the performance of a canon 580 EX flash, and is a must for wedding work and other long shoots. The enhanced weather sealing is also a good feature. Besides the price, my only concern is that the top, where you thread a stap through seems flimsy. It's also right where the seam in the plastic housing is. Most photographers that I have seen using it have attached their straps through the belt loop on the nylon protective sleeve,and this causes the unit to hang a bit awkwardly. Why not also include a cheap strap with it?  I'm also concerned that the connecting cord is permanently attached to the unit. Cords have a tendency to eventually need replacing, and that doesen't seem possible on this unit. Overall though, it does do the job.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Will Smith has a knack for finding great parts in some fun-to-watch science fiction movies like Independence Day and Men in Black.  I, Robot was no different. Will was fun to watch and placed some weel-timed comedic irony, depth of character, and great athletic performance into his character. The special effects were especially well done, and the movie, in general, was a good modern application of Isaac Asimov's short stories of the same name.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love the workouts.  I hate the fact that it takes at least five minutes before you can even get TO the workouts.  You are forced to watch the intro every time you want to use the dvd.  There is no way to jump to the main  menu.  It kind of defeats the whole 20 minute workout idea.    Other than that one little issue, I really do enjoy the workouts.
B00001ODGR|4.0|good concert, they played all the big ones, and did a decent job of it.
031606792X|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking, the fourth book of the Twilight saga is by far the most intricate, delving deeper into the complicated facets of Meyer's magical world of innate abilities and immortals.  The sexual element that was more demure in the first three books was stronger here, but still not graphic, keeping it appropriate for slightly younger audiences.  I eagerly await further work from this author.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|The great director Anthony Mann after having made many Westerns with James Stewart entered into the arena of classic spectacles with this riveting adventure.  Heston & Loren are perfectly matched though during screening they developed an intense dislike to each other to the degree that when Mann cast his next film, \\"The Fall of the Roman Empire\\" with Loren--she requested that Heston not be her co-star (it went to the wooden Stephen Boyd instead).  Nevertheless, they are marvelous together and if you happen to attend a revival showing of this film in Ultra Panavision--do see it.  I was fortunate enough to see this film in that wide format (2.75) several years ago in Berkeley but the Miriam edition is an excellent remastering.Compared to the over-rated, ponderous \\"Ben Hur\\", \\"El Cid\\" showcases Heston at his best particularly in the final scenes as the fallen hero riding to his eventual fate as mythic hero.  Exciting swordfights, splendant Spanish landscapes, the beauty of Loren and Anthony Mann's superb direction make this an all time winner which can be appreciated on a large screen (50' and above) flat panel HDTV.  Totally recommended.
0375424474|4.0|Neil Shubin, codiscoverer of the Tiktaalit, shows in this book that to become a human you must first become a fish. Its a wonderful argument against the notion of `intelligent design'. Or would you call a car manufacturer intelligent who makes a Mercedes by first building a wooden coach? Nevertheless there is an unwholesome streak of creationism and anti-darwinism in Shubins otherwise lucid descriptions, a streak which seems to belong to US-American culture like Samba belongs to Brazil. For example, he criticizes Haeckels `ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' understanding of the way evolution shows up in embryos when Haeckel \\"would compare a human embryo to an adult fish\\". But any changes in the features of an embryo - like going from fish to human - require the action of natural selection to have acted once. Now, natural selection operates on the reproduction success of an animal, and that means adults. Therefore, for any developmental stage of an embryo, there must have existed an adult creature that had evolved just to this stage; and when you trace the embryonic development, a fossil must exist at every level that had achieved just this stage. To understand the embyro, you need to understand Natural selection, which means you must understand the reproduction success of the adult.  It does not suffice to compare the embryos of different species - their \\"blueprints\\" ; Shubin just loves to talk all the time about \\"blueprints\\", which is a typical design term. Tracing embryos runs parallel to tracing the fossils of adults.   For another example, look at the way he describes the recent research situation when it was found that \\"in many single-celled animals, much of the molecular machinery for cell adhesion, interaction, and so on is just not there\\", which \\"would seem to support the notion that the genes that help cells unite to make bodies arose together with the origin of bodies. And at first glance, it seems to make sense that the tools to build bodies should arise in lockstep with the bodies themselves.\\" This idea makes sense, yes - if you are a creationist. If you think like Haeckel, this is nonsense because for selection to produce bodies there must have been a single cell animal with all the needed machinery existing. And as Shubin beautifully narrates, just such an animal turned  up : the choanoflagellates.  Science has been kind to Haeckel, contrary to what Shubin asserts in the book.   Despite my reservations, I highly recommend his book because of Shubins genuine enthusiasm for his subject, and the wealth of new results that he presents. If it had more of Dawkins and much less Gould in it, it would have been splendid. The pictures are as miserable as I have come to expect nowadays in good books about science.
031606792X|5.0|IMHO, this book lived up to the promise of it's predecessors.  By the time the book ended, I could understand and agree with the choices Bella made.  Most loose ends were tied up, but with enough threads left to begin another chapter - someone else's story - in the Twilight universe.  There was loss and gain, romance and suspense and sure - some things might have been a little too obvious to anyone paying attention, but over all, the emotional struggles and growth of the characters made this a fitting ending and a very enjoyable read.
031606792X|5.0|The fourth in a \\"page burner\\" series. These books are well written, appeal to a wide age range, and keep me coming back for more. I realize after reading the Twilight series, my life is very boring!! I highly recommend Stephanie Meyer's work.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Wow, this matches so much with th real life experiences I have had in America. I'm a naturalized American, come from India, and I know Medical Systems in both the countries pretty well. In India, the poorer people can afford the hospitals and the medicines, why? because they are paid for by the government. I agree, the hospitals are overcrowded and there are flies around, but they are never denied the health-care. It takes about 50 cents for the routine doctor checkup visit and about 10 cents for the general prescription medications (subsidized by Govt.) And we are talking about the 'Developing Country like India'. I had a couple of surgeries about ten years ago in India and never had to spend fortune and never denied care. The preventive care was also excellent without putting me on 10 different medicines.<br /><br />I love USA, I am a proud american now, there're definitely 99% good things in USA but 1% is that the screwed up health care. I will go back to India when I am retired as I don't trust the MediCare & Medicaid, (My wife works in the Medical/Health Field). The healthcare system in India so much better than in here.<br /><br />I had a surgery on my knee few years ago and Insurance was denied even after the pre-approval/pre-authorization stuff. After countless hours they finally caughed up some payments.<br /><br />Routinely the Insurance Co. keep denying the Lab-Tests, specialist visits etc etc for the absolutely nonsence and stupid reason.<br /><br />My wife was denied care after 4 nights in the hospital just because her Insurance won't cover it and we were told to go home with the baby before 11 AM. They won't do that in India. My mother in law is also a full time health care worker in India and she was stunned by this.<br /><br />Well, atleast I have an option of going back after my retirement and don't have to be bankrupt like that old couple Michael showed in the movie.<br /><br />\\"What about you my friends?\\"
B00005JPY0|5.0|In a rare case when the sequel is better than its predecessor, The Dark Knight is also the best movie out of the entire Batman franchise, which is no easy feat. The acting in this film is superb, the cast incredibly well picked out, the script is intelligent, and the art direction is breathtaking.   The two qualms I had with [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins]] were the casting of Katie Holmes as Rachel and the fact that the dialogue felt forced and comic book-like. Those two problems have been solved in The Dark Knight with the recasting of the part of Rachel - now given to the arguably less attractive, but much more talented actress Maggie Gyllenhaal and the dialogue contains less soundbites and is much closer to what real people would say in similar situations.  Cinematically, the special effects, stunts, cinematography, and all visual and audio effects are exceptional and far more stunning than one would ever hope for from a summer blockbuster. The Dark Knight is an incredibly intense film, with multiple complex storylines, several villains, several heroes, and no mistakes of any kind. It's truly an artistic achievement. This is the way that movies should be and it's a shame that the public generally accepts something much, much less entertaining from Hollywood. The Dark Knight demands repeated viewings and not simply as a homage to Heath Ledger - this movies deserves to be seen on a huge screen and experienced over and over again.
B0015AARJI|2.0|It works okay.  Not the most responsive controller, but maybe the best available for PS3.  Nothing special really, and very, very overpriced.
B000MIVCX4|5.0|I use this receiver in my car with a Sammy UMPC.  There's lots of nav software to choose from and this piece of hardware works great with the few that I tried.  iNav is my current choice.  This unit holds up great in the high temperatures that my dashboard reaches.  On the way to lake Powell I had 11 satellites locked.  Driving east through Glenwood Canyon on I-70, I lost signal only a couple times and it was quickly regained seconds later.  If you are reading this review, just commit and buy this unit now.  You will not be sorry.  Also, this was my first experience with hardware and software of this type [GPS].  I don't think it could have been easier.  Let me save you some time though by letting you know that M$ Streets and Trips is absolutely worthless and is a total waste of  time, effort and money.  I don't hate M$.  It's just that their gps software really lacks.     EDIT:  This unit is still working EXCELLENT.  I now send it's incoming data to iNAV and Google Earth in realtime using a software GPS Gate.
076790592X|3.0|this book reminds me a lot of Conversations with my dog by Ziglar.....if I had to choose one book out of the two.....it would definetely be Albom.  Both books offer life lessons about many things in life....thought it would be better though....i am getting the DVD to see how the movie does.

0517223546|5.0|This is a much more enjoyable way to gain an appreciation of the complex web of English history than reading history books.  After all, it is more palatable AND memorable to observe the lives of individuals and families rather than just kings and battles, even if most of them are fictional!  Like its language, the country's history has varied and tangled roots that, like the book, span millennia.    Mr. Rutherford display not only a grasp of the events of England's past, but its important themes and cultural strands.  He bravely suggests origins and purposes of Stonehenge, and also suggests how such disparate peoples as Viking and Norman invaders ultimately blended into the human landscape.  The centrality of the rise and fall of a city's cathedral provides an excellent focal point.  I give him particularly high marks for the way he follows several lineages over many centuries, showing how some family characteristics pass through the generations but the top dog spot changes over time.  Thankfully he provides a genealogical chart to help us follow the lines of descent!    The scope, depth, and creativity of Mr. Rutherford's novel is truly impressive.  Few books of this length hold the reader so well.  My usual concern about where the historical facts end and the fabrication begins pertains to this book like others of its genre, so it is not a substitute for a rigorous study of \\"real history\\", if that what you seek.  It is, however, far more entertaining and perhaps, in the final analysis, insightful that many traditional history books.  Unless you are cursed with a short attention span or an affinity for trite plots, this book will not disappoint.
031606792X|4.0|My thirteen year old granddaughter insisted that I read the first book, Twilight.I was hooked throughout the series. I have only five more pages to finish Breaking Dawn. It has cliff hanger's, romance, family strong holds,characters that you come to love & hate. You have the good guy and bad guy. The romance was light (kiss) in the beginning, however, in Breaking Dawn once our characters are married (good thing)vampire love leaves terrible bruises on your (human) body. As long as we remember to explain to our young ladies that this is fantasy love and that real love shouldn't put black and blue marks all over the body. Oh,it's not a scary story.
B001B7CNY2|4.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WAR MOVIES........I RECIEVED IT LAST NIGHT FROM AMAZON........THE PICTURE QUALITY IS OKAY.......I BELIEVE THE REMASTERING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER........THE SOUND IS TOP SHELF.THE SURROUND TRACKS......REALLY ARE TERRIFIC.......AND THE EXTRAS ARE VER NICE AS WELL........IF YOU ENJOYED THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATER......THIS BLU RAY DVD  SHOULD BE PART OF YOUR COLLECTION
B000089RV6|5.0|Los rumores apuntan a que Bon Scott dej&oacute; escritas las canciones de este disco antes de morir ahogado en su propio v&oacute;mito tras una fuerte borrachera. Parec&iacute;a imposible superar \\"Higway to hell\\", pero \\"Back in black\\" es la cima no s&oacute;lo de la banda, sino de todo un g&eacute;nero m&uacute;sical: el heavy metal nunca volver&aacute; a significar lo mismo que en la d&eacute;cada de los ochenta.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. You can play it over and over again because every time the setup changes so it stays fresh. I rated it a three for educational value because although the game does not teach knowledge, it does use the skills of strategy, thinking ahead, and bargaining effectively. Everything else is top notch. The playing pieces are wood, and the game board pieces are very durable. It is an excellent game for hanging out with family or friends. I would suggest getting the expansion pack though, so you can play with a group of 5 or 6. The original game is for a max of 4 people. You can also modify the rules to suit your group. Every group I've played with plays slightly differently.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I purchased this DVD on the advice of a friend who absolutely loves Rupert Penry-Jones and I was not disappointed!!     The acting is top notch and you can feel the heartbreak of lost love between Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot, when Sally Hawkins cries you will cry too!!!     The music from Martin Phipps(same composer as BBC's North and South) is superb!!   I wish he would release a CD of his BBC production scores!!        The only distraction is the running scene at the end!!!   We all want true love in the end but not at the expense of a heart attack!!!     I would need oxygen after running like that in Bath, England!!!     But overall, I highly and unequivocally give this production 5 stars!!!
B000FFJYCU|5.0|If your local movie rental place doesnt carry this movie you have to buy it like I did. If you like Formula 1 then this movie is for you.
067088278X|5.0|This book is beautifully illustrated and a joy to read. The rhyming language used  throughout is enjoyed by young children being read to. Once they start reading for themselves, the young reader enjoys the wordplay and beat of the rhymes. Finding the characters is fun, even after many readings. The firmer pages aids in the life of the book, especially for the very young reader just learning to turn pages.   I enjoyed reading this book to my children, and it was one of my 'must haves' once I became a grandmother. Both of my grandchildren (3.5 years and 18 months) enjoy it with me.
1572816112|5.0|I purchased this deck solely on the name and the pic on the box.  The name \\"Deviant Moon\\" struck a chord with me and I knew I had to have them.  After examining the images, I am in love with them!  The images are similar enough to the traditional imagery to make them easy to read.  On the other hand, the images have enough variety from the traditional images to develop newer and broader interpretations of each card.  Now, we all know the Five of Cups is a card that is sometimes unpleasant to see in a reading, but the Deviant Moon version actually makes me giggle every time I see it.  In traditional decks, the Devil card is usually pretty ominous and it's difficult to see the possibility of rebirth after the change, but in this deck, the rebirth aspect actually speaks louder.  I find all of this refreshing and highly recommend this deck.
031606792X|5.0|I'll admit, after my first read I liked the book but had quite a few questions.  After my second read, 95% of my questions were answered and I LOVED the book.  It was the perfect wrap up.  This is Stephenie's world and I'm so glad I got into it.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|This saga is something that I always wanted ever since I saw my very first Rocky movie known as Rocky III.  Although I saw it on HBO, I wondered if the other two were going to be on as well.  So, I waited for years and years until 1996, when I saw the whole set up to Rocky V.  After purchasing the set, I set up a week to be officially known as Rocky Week and started with Rocky.  As I continued to watch them, I understood why it was known as best picture thirty years ago and the more that I watched, the better I like the story.  The second Rocky was even better then the first and then, came Rocky III.  However, Rocky IV was too brutal but, it did show that even boxing can be dangerous and it is even possible that someone could die during the match as Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) did.  Then, I finished Rocky Week with Rocky V.  For the next several years, I wondered if there will ever be another Rocky and then came Rocky Balboa.  The sixth and final movie of the saga.  I loved the end when the people of Philadelphia were climbing up the Rocky steps and imitating Rocky.  Maybe someday, I can do it too.  Rocky, I Love You!
031606792X|1.0|I am a 39 yr old mother of a 13 year old who has loved this series...till now. My daughter read Breaking Dawn first while I eagerly waited for her to finish. She told me while she was reading that it was not nearly as good as the other books and that the characters seemed \\"not to be themselves\\" to her. Well, I just finished the book myself and have to agree. I think I was even more disappointed than she was. It doesn't seem like the same author even wrote this book. I won't analyze every aspect of this story, but it seems that Meyer totally changed what was so appealing to the teenage readers in the first books. Teenage love. Now we have to read about marriage and babies? Boring! Bella's transformation to a vampire? I never wanted it to happen. Jacob imprinting on Bella's child? Gross. The name Reneesme? Seriously? Fans, I know you have to read it, just maybe borrow it instead of buying.
B001B71NPC|5.0|say your hate words, be mean, whatever, i don't care. i cannot get enough of this album.    ever since Reznor decided to be LESS commercial, and obnoxiously caddy with shameless self promotion, thus not giving a crap who likes it, he's been an influential GOD in the music community.    all hail Reznor for constant changes and progression in music in general, and for changing the music industry completely!!!!    <3
B001BMKOZW|4.0|...if you don't take it too seriously.  The music is great.  Some great guitar riffs (Stoner-Hate (a classic SOAD song), Universe) and incredibly catchy melodies through out.  The drumming has it's moments, but is pretty disappointing coming from John.  I actually think the drumming on Serj's album is better.  The lyrics however are really awful.  Many of the songs have no more than 6 lines of lyrics repeated over and over. And a lot of them don't seem all that deep in thought or feeling.  I'm thinking there maybe a reason \\"Serious\\" is the first song on the album.  \\"You're too serious/You're gonna make me delirious.\\"  Maybe he's trying to tell us right off the bat, don't take what you are about to hear too seriously.  Then again maybe I'm taking him too seriously. It's a really fun album to listen to, just don't read too much in to it.    I think it's kind of unfair to always compare Daron and Serj, but it's fun so I'll do it. There's really no competion, Serj's album is far better.  It rivals many of SOAD's albums.  Serj's album has the music and the thought and substance and while there maybe some better guitar work on Scars, it can't be taken seriously and that hurts it a lot.
B001E7EONC|3.0|It was a good movie but not great, I found some of the nudity disturbing and out of place.
0739321005|5.0|I wish that every American could read this book!  I was moved and impressed as I learned about who Barack Obama is.  This book was written shortly after graduating from law school and before Obama entered politics.  It highlights what an intelligent, perceptive, philosophical and principled person he is.      This is so much more than a simple bio.  Obama's relections about the events of his life are poignant and insightful. I learned so much about the man as he recounted his real education (the one he got on the south side of Chicago) after Occidental, Columbia, and Harvard Law.    Obama's capacity to weave something handsome and strong from the disparate threads of his inheritance gives me hope that through his vision and leadership he can help our country appreciate and make good use of our diversity.
0143142364|5.0|Listening to this audiobook on a recent 18-hour solo drive, I  gained an understanding of what daily life was like in Medieval times through this fascinating story.  I was drawn into the lives of the characters to the point that I was anxious to get up early on day two of my trip just so I could find out what was happening. Wonderful story, skillfully told.  I will read more Ken Follett in the future.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|First and foremost, I like the album, but this is not SlipKnot. Same band name and same members, but this sounds like a Stone Sour album. I love Stone Sour, but the album cover says SlipKnot! Again, I like the album, great production, vocals, speed, and drumming, but what happened to the brutal anger and haunting, violent lyrics that made SlipKnot... \\"SlipKnot\\"?
B000002UAR|5.0|With haunting melodies like \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"She Said She Said\\" to name just a few, this is a very pleasing Beatles effort to listen to. If anyone needed proof that there's more to the Beatles than their hits, look no further. This album fluctuates effortlessly between vocal-centered pieces and George Harrison's much-loved sitar-driven melodies, and here I've only scraped the surface of the creativity that goes into the instrumentation.<br /><br />For Revolver is a creative album, a joy to listen to and to take in. The melodies are a true musical mind-scape, ranging from easy-going melodies to the mysterious sound effects of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". It is, finely put, a mystery of an album in itself. A truly solid piece of music-making, a year before Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which is generally considered a cornerstone in that area. Revolver is a very special album to me, and as I hear \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" drifting through my mind yet again, I can see why.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|All,      I'm at work so I'll be brief.      This album is definitely way better than Subliminal and marginally better than Iowa as this new album has substantially more substance and style than Iowa. Don't get me wrong, I loved Iowa as it was a full blown assault metal wise. All hope is gone gets better with each listen as did Iowa, or the self titled for that matter. I remember buying the self title when it came out and I said to myself \\" What the F^@% is this crazy S#^@!\\" However, after numerous listens I fell in love with this band. From the beginnings of MFKR to now, Slipknot has always been about change and experimentation. I think that's why I like them so much as they really don't give a rats A$@ what the critics have to say but produce music for themselves and of course there fan base. This album is good and angry as was Iowa with a twist of melodic undertones. Let's face it, Corey can sing superbly in many styles and I'm glad he chooses to bring that to Slipknot.      L8R: RAZ
B0016OOM7Q|5.0|this item is really good. especially the candy coloured vinyl. for any fan of madonna this is a must have. at first i hesitated to order it because of the silliness of the cover.

B0000X61VE|2.0|I agree with other reviewers who have commented here on the effect of this video on one's joints.  I myself developed a very bad knee problem because of this video that lasted for months. The video is too fast so it doesn't strengthen your muscles, just puts a lot of stress on your joints. Cindy's form in this video is pretty terrible, particularly in lounges, where her knee goes way over her toes.    I use this video occasionally for abwork and stretches, but when I do use it, I don't do the reps as fast as she does.   Instead of this one, I would recommend the sequel to this video (New Challenge) which is quite decent.
0446691437|5.0|I cannot rate this book highly enough.  It is one to read over and over again.  I stumbled upon a copy years ago and each time I pick it up, I learn something new.  Many thanks to Steven Pressfield for writing this very valuable, uplifting, \\"meaning of life\\" book.
0618680004|5.0|It is my goal to provide an honest review of this book, as seen from my perspective.  I appreciate what Dawkins says, from the viewpoint of his arguement.  Dawkins also, surprisingly, admits that the existance of God is a 50/50 chance.  He does, however, provide arguments for why he believes God is improbable.  The book is split into two parts.  The first half of the book is Dawkins' argument against religion.  The second half is a scientific history of religion and a hypothesis for why it began.    Regardless of if you are Atheist or Theist, I think both sides can appreciate (not neccessarily agree with) Dawkins' arguments.  For Atheist's, Dawkins provides a central scientific argument for Atheists beliefs.  Saddly enough, Atheist's are persecuted everywhere, simply because of what they believe.  This is eerily reminiscent of the persecutions of jews and christians elsewhere.  Theist's should not look at this book in disdain, but see it as a resource.  Challenge makes people stronger, and \\"The GOD Delusion\\" is definitely a challenge.    This book was written for the Atheist, not the Theist or Christian.  Dawkins states repeatedly that its not his intent to convert people, but to provide his arguments to those who share his belief.  I found his arguments well thoughtout, a bit over explained, and quite stimulating.  For the Athiest this book is a true breath of fresh air and a source of solace.    While I have no doubt, that because I said positive things about this book that my review will be terribly rated, I felt compelled to share my view.  As an Atheist living in the christian dominated American society, I'm often smothered by the religious beliefs of others.  While the Constitution provides freedom of religion, it does not afford freedom FROM religion.    Mr. Dawkins, Thank you sir.  Thank you for letting me know that I am not alone in my beliefs, and thank you for your richly inspiring arguments.
031606792X|2.0|i would have rated BD better if it wasnt a part of the twilight series. that being said, i thought this final enstallment was written from a completely different author. many, many times i was like \\"wait..is this really S.Meyer writing this?\\" all of the tension between bella/edward/jacob and the volturi that was built up in the series was almost nonexistant in BD. it felt like the author ran out of storyline and plot and filled the entire book with fluff until the very end, only to let down the reader..again.     it was a decent story, but a complete let down for being the conclusion of the twilight series.

A planet that still workships the Gods of Old, steel and knighthood.<br /><br />This masterpiece is so well written that it amazes me. How in the world a normal person can plot such an intrincate story?, so many characters? How does Mr. Martin creates such elavorate personalities? It's a rollercoaster of intrigue and excitement.<br /><br />I read somewhere that \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was the equivalent of \\"The Sopranos in medieval times\\", well, somehow it is. Prepare yourself to get engulfed in the world of The House of Starks and Lammisters, the Black Brotherhood that watches \\"The Wall\\" up north. Beyond this wall, a terror is rising. \\"The Others\\" cold and souless creatures are moving forward.<br /><br />Prepare to experience treachery,secret whispers, magic, dragons, rape, murder, poisoning, honor, pain, diplomacy and betrayal at it's best. Prepare to loose yourself page after page inside one of the best new epic fantasies of our time.<br /><br />Mr. George R.R. Martin at least from my point of view can stand proud side by side with Mr. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.<br /><br />The first of six. Read it and enjoy!!!!<br /><br />P.S. - Some say it's too long to read...I say bring more.<br /><br />Cheers!!!!
B001BGTWXI|1.0|I remember hearing the concept of Slipknot back in '99, wanting to check them out. All I needed to hear was a small snippet of 742617000027 to convince me to buy their debut and I've been hooked ever since. Ever since they hit the scene I've heard nothing but complaints bashing them. It added to my respect. Here were guys playing nu-metal, the most loathed sub-genre in the history of music, and even though I have heard many a hard fast metal band, I have never heard anyone sound as pissed off as Slipknot. Not to mention I've never heard anyone who sounds as unique as Slipknot. Their last 3 albums and their live album put them on the list of my favorites.     So when the single \\"All Hope is Gone\\" was dropped a few months ago, I listened and I began counting down the days to this album, practically salivating for its release. I bought my copy and expected to be impressed. I quite frankly have never been more disappointed and frustrated with an album in my life.     The album starts off with .execute which is a perfect weird intro to get you psyched up for Gematria. The song is nothing short of amazing, it's like elements of thrash, nu-metal, metalcore and an angry hornet's nest thrown in a blender. It's one of the hands-down best songs they have put out. Unfortunately the majority of the remainder of the album doesn't live up to that. Heck, it doesn't even live up to the standard of being called good.     Tracks like \\"Sulfur,\\" \\"Wherein Lies Continue,\\" \\"Psychosocial\\" and others all start off like strong metal tracks, but when the melodic choruses kick in the music all of a sudden changes to a simple bland rock sound. It completely castrates any brutality and hardness that the songs have and it so jolting it ruins the songs. It's not like these guys have never put melodies and clean vocals in their stuff before (\\"Left Behind\\" and \\"Duality\\" come to mind) but this just sounds horrible. They manage pull it off on \\"The Butcher's Hook,\\" so it just makes those other tracks even worse.     I'm not one of those guys complaining about how this isn't Iowa or the album isn't 100% non-stop brutal, I liked the stuff they added to their sounds in Vol. 3. Heck, \\"Danger - Keep Away\\" is one of my favorite tracks by them. But the stuff they added on Vol. 3 had one thing going for it...it was unique. Tracks like \\"Snuff,\\" \\"Vendetta,\\" and \\"Dead Memories\\" sound like stuff we've heard five thousand times over on rock radio (key word `rock,' not metal). It's cookie cutter. It's infuriating to hear it on this album. It may be cliché to say it now but the tracks really DO sound like Stone Sour, which would be great if I paid for a Stone Sour CD.     That's not to say the entire album is crap. \\"This Cold Black,\\" \\"All Hope is Gone,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Gematria\\" are killer. They are a change from the norm, infusing their old style with thrash and other metal elements. \\"Gehenna\\" is the only time they sound unique with their melodic attempts. The song sounds like a booze and acid induced depression anthem, the type of song that Marilyn Manson wishes he made.     Fanboy maggots are complaining that people who dislike this album simply can't handle the fact that Slipknot's sound has \\"evolved\\" and \\"matured.\\" Why is it the preconceived notion that to mature your sound you have to sound like every other band on the planet? And what's the point of evolving if you're not going from a unique sound to a commercialistic mess? It's not like metal can't be complex, mature, brutal and unique, if you don't believe me you should listen to bands like Meshuggah and Gojira. You say \\"mature\\" and \\"evolved\\", I say \\"bland\\" and \\"uninspired.\\" Is it such an unrealistic concept to expect a band comprised of 9 members in masks and jumpsuits to sound different?    Basically about 4 tracks on this album actually sound like the band is trying to please their old fans and actually gain new ones with this album, by adding some new to the old. The majority of the album sounds as if thisband is limping along on its last leg, bored out of their skulls, and trying to please the unadventurous masses.    If these guys make a Vol. 5 (if they don't break up before then) I hope its impressive, or all hope is indeed gone for this band
0553378384|5.0|This is an amazingly accurate picture of your moon signs.  giving you a great overview of what karma you are here to overcome and lessons needed to learn.  its more impressive that sun signs for sure. i have recommended it to at least a dozen people.
0743290119|2.0|As a person who is open-minded with all types of literature, I would have to honestly say that Weisberger's most recent attempt is a near-miss of her intended target.. what's sad is that this book somehow still managed to be a best seller.    Cheating boyfriends who lead you to belittle yourself and your beliefs... sleeping with vast amounts of men and viewing it as not only a testament to your attractiveness, but also to your high self-value... and even better - cheating on your significant other because you're afraid to confront the issues you have as to where you see the relationship going... WOW! Talk about a guide to living fabulously in one of the greatest cities on Earth in your late 20s - early 30s.  I'm sorry Ms. Weisberger, but as cute as this attempt was, it was somewhat of a sad one.    The story revolves around three women approaching their 30s who suffer from neurotic tendencies and crappy relationships after living in New York for almost a decade.  With \\"adventures\\" experienced through local and international travels, as well as \\"adventures\\" created through personal bets, you'll understand exactly how you did without... trust me.  I personally don't see sleeping around nor receiving an engagement ring (ergo the title) as a symbol of personal change or a way to signify some type of all-important testament to my success.  If you do, seek help (ahem, Ms. Weisberger).  In fact, does anyone actually believe sex and traveling solve personal issues and problems?  If you do, maybe you should consult a therapist.    Even though I don't agree with the book's apparent themes of sex and traveling as means to self-discovery and to solving problems, I do agree with the undertone of the value of treating yourself to the spoils of a spa pampering day.  It does go a long way!    You know... just to let you know, I'm a born and raised New Yorker (in fact... I still live here), and somehow I find it hilarious that I manage to have a healthy successful relationship, as well as no desire to sleep with anything that has an additional appendage, while maintaining my independence.  From these literary characters... one would think it can't be done... then again... isn't that the aim of the modern day chick lit formula?  To give your audience the mantra \\"we shall overcome\\" through overused examples?    Hey Weisberger (and this goes for you, too, Bushnell)... STOP BELITTLING ME AS A WOMAN AND ATTACKING MY AGE GROUP! There's nothing wrong with being an independent woman in her 20s who is approaching her 30s. The women of my generation are not as self-centered or as unstable as you paint them to be.    I don't see anything wrong with reading the book, personally, but don't waste $26 or $.01 on the book... just borrow it from your local library.  That's where I donated the copy I bought.
0307387178|5.0|I loved the detailed pieces of the puzzle that Krakauer assembled.  I did not particularly like his story \\"into thin air\\", but I loved \\"into the wild\\".  I also liked the movie too.  In the end, I thought Krakauer left a favorable testimonial to the kid.  He rambled and lived as he wanted.  He may not have meant to die, but he should not have had any regrets.  Contrary to what many people tell me, I do not find this to be a sad or depressing story and I do not feel that he should be considered to have wasted his life.

0786186291|5.0|O'Brian was a master storyteller.  This is must-read swashbuckling literature.  The movie, although a sort of mish-mash of stories, was great too.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|Saw this at the theater, first. Not too bad. Good to see natalie Portman has started to act. her amadala was, to be honest, pretty plastic. Scarlet Johansson was good. She has a much better range than Portman. The Henry VIII actor should have been chosen to look a bit more like Henry. Also, the presence of the English King was a bit weak.
031606792X|4.0|I did receive the book on time, but the book had been out for a little while before I received it through the mail.  I found it for the same price at Costco.
B0012GN0Z8|5.0|While the product was exactly as promised, my complaint is with the shipping. I paid the $11.98 for \\"next day\\" delivery and it took 6 days to arrive. My recomendation is when ordering from Amazon pay for regular delivery. It will arrive much sooner and cheaper.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I've been a Final Fantasy fan all the way back when my older brothers used to let me \\"play\\" the original NES Final Fantasy with an unplugged controller...i was 5 but even then i was in awe with each story told by a legion of warriors trying to save the world.<br /><br />That was until i played my first pc game in 3d, Final Fantasy 7. I had grown with that mystique around me, with those out of this world moments that you just can see in your mind but can't explain with words. And if i ever had a glimpse of a vision of what those moments would look like, i can honestly say they never looked this good.<br /><br />Advent Children is by far the best CG Motion Picture created from a game, it's the way a sequel is meant to be when put into a film and taking the whole world of Final Fantasy as the canvas to your story telling. It's a complex movie that tries to push the envelope real hard but that in the end sums up what every Final Fantasy game had and involved everyone of us when we played it, a story about honor, courage, valor, ultimately unveiling the power that makes this world survive and keeping a wish to retain all hope and saving it within a fantasy we all have seen.<br /><br />Great movie
B001AHM2C6|3.0|Indeed , this second installement of Nolan's Batman movies has a soundtrack much stronger and intenser then Batman Begins from a few years ago . I listened to the track samples on the official site , those are way too short to get an idea of how good Zimmer and Newton composed this fine piece of music . This is not background music while you're eating dinner , this is a cd filled with emotions and I even use some tracks like \\"I thought my jokes were bad\\"  while I'm running to keep me going , otherwise in the car when I turn up the volume I relive some of the scenes of the movie again . But even if you haven't seen the movie and you can appreciate a good quality soundtrack this is highly recommended .   The special edition doesn't cost a lot more so I opted for the fancy cover , otherwise there is not much special about this edition compared to the reular version .
B000UFAURI|5.0|I have to listen to E,S,P&C at least once a day, from start to finish. Love it from beginning to end, loud to soft, fast-paced to slow. It's amazing. The melodies grab you, and the harmonies and Dave's voice don't let you go.
B001BR5F4C|4.0|The Whole Bloody Affair isn't even released on DVD yet.<br /><br />The movies have been out for 4 years and if the whole bloody affair isn't even on DVD yet, then it will be a while for the Blu-Ray anyways.<br /><br />It's been out unrated in Japan since the movies came out, and it's still not out in the US. I think it's safe to buy these, and enjoy them in Hi Def with Lossless Audio.
031606792X|5.0|*A bit of a Spoiler here*  I just don't get how fans do not like Breaking Dawn, this novel(this entire series in fact), should rightly receive five stars and I will tell you why:    First of all, the saga involves a teenage girl who is average, or at least feels average- I am no longer a teen but I certainly understood her thoughts and feelings of inferiority. But then she meets Edward and she has an adoring friend, Jacob, who has helped her in her most trying times. The series kept me up well into the wee hours of the morning because I was so engrossed in how Meyer explored teen relationships, and even though she has not intended on a \\"message\\" or \\"lesson\\" for us all to learn and absorb from the work, I took her series to reflect how love is a very strong bond: whether its love between friends, family, living or dead.    Breaking Dawn tied up some loose ends. I'm not sure what the fans were expecting, but it ended with Bella being able to live forever with her real family and that made it a pretty real conclusion to me. Perhaps people thought  that real life isn't so tidy.     By the way, I am so Team Jacob, and was pretty upset he imprinted on someone else. Actually, he was the main reason I read the books at all.

B0000AQS6R|5.0|Words cannot describe what happens when your family sits down and watches this movie during the month of December. It doesnt have to be Christmas Eve or Christmas night, any night you happened to have free in December will do. We do it every year. And honestly every year, we hear a funny line we never heard before. We must have been laughing too hard the year before.<br />Every family should own this movie. Seeing it with commercials on tv isnt as good as watching it all the way through the way it was intended. This has got bo the funniest holiday movie ever made. A Christmas Story is up there and so is the original National Lampoons Vacation but there is something extra special about this one.<br />My wish for everyone is that they would be blessed with people to watch this movie with during the Christmas season.<br />My advice is skip the ties and leather wallets and buy this movie instead - it will last longer and bring more joy.
0789318121|2.0|This is a good, not great, book about the concept art that went into the making of \\"The Dark Knight\\" movie.  The entire shooting script comprises three quarters of the book.  It should be noted that the shooting script does not include scenes that were deleted, discarded, etc., so one doesn't get any idea of what the \\"big picture\\" was when making this movie.  The artwork is good but there is not enough of it, and there's very little on the actual making of the film, things like locations, props and prop making, costume design, and visual effects.  Overall, the companion book for \\"Batman Begins\\" had the exact same problems.  Good but not great, the cover promises cool stuff that it doesn't quite deliver...  Even without the amazing success the movie has had, this movie deserved a better tie-in book than this...
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|At long last!!! Criterion, long a champion of this, arguably the most difficult movie ever made, gives us an edition that makes the movie look better than new. I have purchased every edition of this film from Criterion since the original laserdisc, and this one clearly surpasses every one of the available editions. This is way superior to he Region 2 release by the British Film Institute. The complete package does justice to Pasolini's warped, unflinching vision of the Italian Fascist regime, and is to be recommended to any serious collector of world film.<br /><br />A WARNING!!! This film will change you. The progression of this film is completely and unabashedly sadistic. If you have never seen it, it is not easy to watch. On the other hand, it shows Pasolini's firm, passionate, unerring hand in realizing material that would have been diminished by a lesser artist.<br /><br />BRAVO, again, CRITERION!

I think that maybe I'm lucky to not have seen<br />it before on it's regular broadcast, so now I can enjoy it for the<br />first time, but, I would have been just as upset as the rest of the<br />folks when they took it off the air, bad move I think, a really bad<br />move on their part to not continue this.<br />Loved the Serenity movie, actually saw that first and found out about<br />the series, so it was kind of a spoiler to see what happens to everyone<br />I'll not give any of that away in this review, but if you can, get this<br />series first and then watch the movie Serenity, you'll enjoy it all the more.<br /><br />G2

B000OVLBFS|4.0|Jesse Stone - Night Passage    The movie reminds me being in a small bar with a pianist playing a light piano with the lights down dim.  There is some talking but it is soft.    I just loved the flow of the movie, the perfection of Selleck for the main character.  Jesse Stone, played by Tom Selleck, a sheriff in a small town, does not say very much, his face is full of expression.  What he does say is meaningful.  It is surprising that Jesse Stone, a man with a lot of painful baggage, can be so understanding around everyone he meets.  Everything about the character is direct.  It is rare for me to find a movie that will entice me to read the book, but this one certainly has done that for me.  It is unfortunate, for me, that the author, Robert Parker, has written a series of book around this character.  I just hate it when I find a book, that I would like, and then discover there is a series of them on one character.  Well there goes again, hours and hours of time committed, locked into the storytelling of some author.    The movie is just wonderful in every way. Robert Harmon, a distinguished made for TV Director has done a spectacular job.  I give this a 8.5 out of 10, or a 4 stars out of 5.
B000A3XY9Q|4.0|If you liked the first Evil Dead movie then this will be a nice refresher of some very similar scenarios. After seemingly escaping with his life intact, Ash is back in a cabin! I tell you that boy has no common sense but without his poor judgment who else would release demons back onto our domain? So back in the cabin - check, new girlfriend - check, recycled gift given ( necklace) to new girlfriend since the last one died - check, demon book in cabin - check, tape recorder with the words needed to release the evil - check...we are back in business! Ash gets back to doing what he knows best - unleashing havoc into the world of the living. One would think that he has joined some wicked book of the month club, where the books end up getting people killed as he's always finding them. Best part is that the action starts right of the bat, there is no sitting around waiting to be attacked and when few more people get stranded in the cabin the real fun begins.    This movie was insane, I mean bug out crazy! All the things you think you'd do in your wildest dreams come to life - horror style. Not only is Ash running in circles from the menacing evil, but his own body turns on him and starts to betray him, leaning towards the dark side. Best part was the puppets again, there were some gooey gross faces from the demonic possession due to the transformation and sometimes I didn't know whether to laugh or just watch in disbelief.    This movie felt very short in comparison but the ending was fantastic, it really sets you up for a grand finale that I can't wait to watch.     - Kasia S.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Having witnessed many forms of addiction throughout my life, I have to say, this film excellently portrays the sorts of lives addicts lead and the challenges they face. It's unusual mix of horror and humor make it difficult to classify, but its storyline and characterizations are heavily engrossing and keep you glued throughout. In a way, you participate in your own \\"trip\\" as you identify with the characters and follow their exploits, like a joyride into another life. Certainly this is great film making.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I committed to reading the series even though the first book was extremely badly written.  By badly written I mean the author lacks serious writing skills particularly in character development and \\"logistics\\".  So book 2 and 3 got a little better and a little more exciting. The addition of Jacob filled the stories with something other than, Oh you are so beautiful and OH I WANT TO SUCK YOUR BLOOD BUT I\\"M A VEGETARIAN I CAN\\"T....This book is an absolute insult to the intelligence of the youth audience.  Sure the intended audience is young but it doesn't mean they are stupid.      Stephanie Meyer is obviously Mormon and I believe that her religious beliefs got in the way of a what could have been an exciting \\"SAGA\\".   First of all when you choose to write about vampires you pretty much have to assume that you are breaking the rules somewhat when it comes to sex and morals.  All of us have resigned to the fact that in literature the intrigue of the vampire is sex and lust and blood and kill.  So for Stephanie to completely wipe that out of her books is what kills this whole Twilight Saga. For god's sake she even took out the fangs. Give the teenage audience some credit here, they grew up in the age of hollywood make belief and they've seen more that you give them credit for Stephanie. A pair of fangs isn't going to make it or break it here.... I believe what ruins the ending is that she chose to marry them and have a child at 19 (very mormon).  Terrible message to send out to that audience!!! I much rather would have preferred them to go the college route. She really missed the boat on book 4 because there were some real opportunities to put some excitement in the story.  I mean she finally becomes a vampire this was the moment we all were waiting for, but she kills it by throwing in this child birth for a teenage audience, GIVE ME A BREAK I don't think they are really interested in childbirth Stephanie, how about some passion and romance??     Some of the other sillything in this book are the way she chose to wiggle herself out of certain pitfalls that she set up for herself. One of them is how do you deal with Charlie and Rene and most importantly Jacob?....if my daughter came back from the amazon and you told me sorry she has a serious disease and she's quarantined, I would have broken the door to that house down to see her. How stupid is this Charlie guy? he's a cop on top of it....so he just lays there quietly and says Oh ok honey, feel better?   Also when he sees Jacob Phase into a wolf he sort of just accepts it? And oh the best part is, here's your newborn grandaughter who can talk, but don't ask any questions oK? WHAT????  There are so many things in these books that don't make sense that I have to seriously question WHO IS GIVING THESE BOOKS 5 stars?      Stephanie should have never tried to make these Vampires into a happy Mormon Family.  She had a great oppurtunity to make the world of the Volturi, the Cullens and the warewolves collide in an intriguing way. No one looses in these books and they all leave happily ever after.  Even Bambi and little mermaid loose their mothers ....there's always someone who looses and someone who wins, but not in Stephanie;s world... I think the youth audience is really prepared to handle a lot more than Stephanie was able to dish out.  OH and as a final note: PLEASE STOP COMPARING THESE BOOKS TO HARRY POTTER!!!!!!
B000MQC9H4|3.0|Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is a Hollywood producer who's just gotten her heart broken; Iris Simkins (Kate Winslet) lives in England and is also at the losing end of a romance.  Both ladies are miserable and decide to get away from home for Christmas.  They find each other on an online house-switch site and before you can say \\"I know how this is going to end!\\" Amanda is living in a cozy English cottage and Iris is ensconced in a luxurious LA mansion.  And you'll never guess what happens next.  (Okay, you will guess - in about half a minute.)<br /><br />Diaz, Winslet, and co-stars Jude Law and Jack Black are all fine here, looking beautiful and clever and giving sincere performances.  It's not their fault that the script is so predictable and corny with no room for WHY these new loves blossom so quickly, so blissfully, and so conveniently, considering the women are emotionally wounded and would need some time to heal and the men are not looking for relationships.  And what exactly are the odds of meeting your dream mate within hours of moving to a foreign country?  Eli Wallach gives a winning performance as a doddering old scriptwriter befriended by Iris, but again, it's all too perfect; there's no question that they will become instant buddies and that their lives will both be enriched by their friendship.<br /><br />If I were a woman in the 18-26 target group, I'd probably love this movie and even shed a few tears at it; as it is, I just kept thinking, \\"Well, there's five hours of my life I'll never get back.\\"  (What?  It's only 136 minutes?  Impossible!  I thought it would never end.)
B000WGWQG8|5.0|As a libertarian, I am not a fan of John Adams nor of statist hagiographer David McCullough. I read McCullough's [[ASIN:0671869205 Truman]] at the urging of my grandfather and found it to be boring and ridiculously aggrandizing of the state, the presidency, and Truman the man. I had no intention of watching this HBO miniseries but did so, reluctantly, at the urging of my father-in-law.<br /><br />He certainly gave better advice than my granddad!<br /><br />Words cannot properly express how much I enjoyed this production. It is, without a doubt, the best historical film I've ever seen. I was worried that the founders would be portrayed as saints with little serious disagreement among them, but this was not the case at all. In fact, the miniseries pretty much follows the hardcore Jeffersonian line, depicting Washington as a Hamiltonian pawn and Adams as a Big Government centralist and possibly even monarchist.<br /><br />Adams is portrayed favorably, nonetheless, which it is quite likely is deserved. A man can be honorable and hold on strongly to wrongheaded ideas. Adams was an authoritarian and the miniseries does nothing to disabuse the viewer of this notion. Jefferson was for liberty, although his faults are accurately portrayed as well. For one, there is his imprudent support of the French Revolution, and on a more esoterically constitutional level, Adams is shown mocking Jefferson's contradictory support of the Louisiana Purchase -- which libertarians and paleocons perceive to be a gross abandonment of Jeffersonian principles and the first act of American Imperialism.<br /><br />Where Adams and Jefferson can find agreement is in their utter contempt for proto-neocon Alexander Hamilton. He is surely this miniseries' villain, whereas Adams and Jefferson are simply men of honor with radically different ideas. This presentation largely accurately depicts the formation of the United States through the time of Adams's death, as a battle of ideas. Although the pre-constitutional period is given short shrift, so are the Revolutionary and 1812 wars -- thankfully! There is no glorification of war here, and in fact, Adams's crowning achievement is keeping the U.S. out of war with France. If only modern presidents could be so motivated.<br /><br />Ideology aside, this production is beautifully rendered and emotionally engaging. The history is wrong in a few small and rather insignificant parts, but all in all, this is not only an immensely enjoyable viewing experience, but also extremely educational. This truly is something that could engage young minds in the ideas of our country's founding period, and thus, I recommend that it be viewed by high school government and/or American History classes.shrift, so are the Revolutionary and 1812 wars -- thankfully!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|After watching the mini series on HBO I became so enthralled with it, I had to order the DVD (which by the way was promptly delivered to me in 3 days). This 7 hr series is so riveting in it's depiction of our founding fathers and their struggle for our country's independence; it greatly reawakened my interest in early American history. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are both outstanding and deserve Emmys for their performances. Well done !!!

0120884674|4.0|This 'pocket' edition offers the forensic student and professional a handy and detailed field manual.  The book is broken into two main sections, the beginning chapters offer an introduction to the science of forensics while the later chapters cover in precise detail the bones and their features systematically.  A handy scale and comprehensive chapters on ethics, recovery and modification via animals and weathering makes this volume valuable for the archaeologist.  Black and white photographs express bone topography from several angles and from the same individuals to maintain scale and morphology.  The brief glossary could be expanded with definitions for basic Latin and Greek scientific terms for beginner students.
006054094X|5.0|This is no more \\"fantasy\\" than the \\"accepted\\" version of events!<br /><br />It was a great read, especially compared to official (probably made-up)Eurocentric boring accounts.<br /><br />If Menzies can get people passionate about ancient history then who cares just WHO went where and when? It's a good read.
0385333846|5.0|The book jumps all over the place in a captivating way. I wouldn't necessarily call it SF though.
B0000CC5CS|5.0|This movie is a really great installment in the franchise and I think that this is one of those kind of films that grow more popular through the years. If you are a fan of the Terminator series, then you will find some fun to be had with this movie. There is ton of action and the story really advances the mythology as John meets the person who will eventually teach him how to lead the human resistance.<br /><br />The opening storyline of the movie is also very interesting when the new Terminator, the T-X, targets John's future lieutenants. The T-X is a very cool new Terminator and is more advanced than the T-1000. Arnold is awesome as always, the best line has to be when he asks the male stripper to take his clothes off. Overall, I think this movie is really cool and will become even more important when the next film comes out.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Like many cinematic masterpieces, it's not possible to summarize this film in a TV-guide style and portray any sense of its monumental achievement. I'm not going to describe its content but it's a film that every person should watch as a lesson for not just where true evil can lead, but also how hope, honesty and humanity offers redemption.<br /><br />It's even more of a testament to Steven Spielberg that he was reviewing FX reels of Jurassic Park in between filming sequences for this, since ever shot is vital to the film and perfectly crafted. It's also one of the few films that warrant buying a home theater system for - you simply won't believe the difference when viewing on a large LCD screen with surround sound.<br /><br />I originally saw this three times at the movie theater, which is a major commitment for a 4-hour film. I've also seen it several times on cable and accidentally ended up watching the whole thing. It's simply one of the most compelling films ever made and, as a piece of art, grabs you from the very beginning to the very end.<br /><br />---<br />PS - As an aside, I once saw this in the theater in London where a bunch of skinheads were at the front making constant derogatory comments and slurs. About 25 minutes in, a jumbo-sized container full of Coke whizzed passed my ear and hit one of them on the squarely on the back of the head, knocking him unconscious on the floor. The whole theater erupted with cheers and applause, and it's one of the most satisfying acts of swift justice I've ever witnessed!
0743289692|5.0|One of the few life-changing books that I would consider a must-read for all: honest, direct, and with inspiring moral clarity.

B0018RWMNM|5.0|Reviews abound on the quality of the storyline, the cast and the acting, the filming, how viewers who \\"don't like Westerns\\" or \\"can't sit still through a long movie\\" regard this as a masterpiece.  They are correct-no better film's ever been made, in my opinion.    The Blu-Ray presentation of the film is very nice, with good color and excellent sound, both improved over the DVD release.  A common complaint on other Amazon reviews has been the cropping of the original film dimensions to fit a 16:9 screen--a process that does end up costing some of the original film (mostly on the bottom of the screen).  The trade-off is that all of the screen real-estate on your beautiful, expensive plasma or LCD is filled--no black bars, no stretched faces.  For me, it's a worthwhile tradeoff.  It's really not noticeable to me, and if you are engrossed in the story and the scenery, you won't notice much either.    If you're a lucky owner of a good TV and a Blu-Ray player, this all-time classic Western belongs in your library.  Highly recommended.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|This 2nd Criterion release is a serious upgrade from the previous release. I was surprised by the package when I first opened it. It is quite substantial. You get 2 DVDs and a 80 page book that includes photographs and text explaining the history behind the movie. The DVDs sit in a package that is also wrapped with photos from the movie. The video quality also seems like a nice boost from the original that I remember. To date, this is my favorite Criterion release and I hope they continue to release more packages like this.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|Just wanted to say I think this is her best work in some time.  It is edgy in a great, energetic, way, still with great vocals and lyrics.  Has been in constant play since purchase.  Very happy to have taken the plunge again with Alanis!

0812550757|3.0|Don't get this if you liked Ender's game and are looking for a sequel. Speaker for the Dead has only one of the same characters - Ender - and he's much older. No one he knew is in this book, and there's little that relates to his past or future.    If that were not enough, I found the book to be subdued and tedious, and somehow off-center. It certainy isn't Card's best at all. The story doesn't have a lot of coherence, and none of the characters are very memorable or admirable at all. Alot of details and features of the story really iritated me.    I think if he wanted to write this story, he should have just presented it as a totally new book. I came to this wanting a sequel to Ender's Game (a masterful and original book) but instead got a book that had nothing to do with Ender's game besides Ender himself appearing in it. I know Speaker for the Dead has a lot of sequels too but a far more interesting line of sequels to follow, if you liked Ender's Game, is Ender's Shadow, followed by Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets and Shadow of the Giant, which deal with the story of Ender's Game from Bean's point of view and then the other students of Battle School and what happens back on Earth. Read those instead of Speaker for the Dead.
0385474547|5.0|I know this is the classic debate of all time when it comes to literature: Is it about beautifully written prose (THE STORY OF EDGAR SAWTELLE, incidentally, is a good example of this problem) or does it tell a compelling story? (yet the prose itself is not its strong point).      It seems that many works of fiction these days are of the former and unfortunately, not enough of the latter. I recently re-read this book along with another classic, JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN, after a discussion I had with a friend about this very subject. As a middle-aged person, I often look back at the books that made a difference in my life and much of the time, it's not about the author's writing style. Achebe's is a plain, straightforward style, but it's what he is conveying that is so striking about this story. (I am a bit miffed at the \\"English\\" teachers and the like who are downing this book!) Bottom line: I was left with a lasting impression that stayed with me. I can't say that many books do this today.    All I can say is pick up this read and decide for yourselves. Bottom line, this story is just as relevant today as it was so many years ago when it first appeared. These issues are universal and the world today is replete with similar conflicts.
B0002TJGQS|1.0|These batteries are just junk. I bought 5 batteries: 1 just worked for less than 10 days in my polar monitor, 2 worked less than 1 day and the other two did not work at all! Total waste of money!
0756404746|5.0|I am not usually one to write reviews on here, but this novel is just too good to not write about.<br /><br />This is one of the best novels I have ever read.  The plot was paced well, the characters were human and non-cliched, the story was completely engrossing, and the humor was actually humorous.<br /><br />Though, this book is a bit longer than most I read, I found myself unable to put it down.  I read it, to the end, in just one day.  I found myself shutting off the television, radio, and other devices and just getting lost in this book.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide what book to read next, I would recommend this over any other. (Even for non-fantasy novel fans)<br /><br />A bit of a warning though: The next volume doesn't come out for quite awhile.  I can't wait for it to come out!
0312995423|1.0|Since the book has 100+ chapters, although most are incredibly short (say, 1 or 2 pages), I will adopt a similar approach to this review.     Chapter 1:  I was given this book by a friend a couple of years ago, who suggested I read it.  It stayed on my bookshelf unread until earlier this week.  I think I looked at it too soon.      Chapter 2: Some of the characters here are supposed to be experts in cryptography, but they do a horrible job at making passwords. I was able to guess a couple of them, and one is only a single character!  The love interest of the main cryptographer keeps writing the phrase \\"without wax,\\" whose meaning eludes the cryptographer over the whole book. Um, we're in the age of the Internet, people.....     Chapter 3: The technical premise of the book (the NSA has some super computer that can crack all codes.. even those whose design it doesn't know?!?) is laughable.     Chapter 125:  If an ad is going to be made encouraging people to recycle paper, they should use a lot of copies of this book in the ad, because that is certainly the best use that can be made of Digital Fortress.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|the product arrived in great condition, we watched it that night.  I couldn't believe the speed at which it came-I wish that 3rd party retailers for Amazon would ship their items with such enthusiasm.  Amazon needs to instill a condition in regards to 3rd party retailers, that they must send their items (books & movies) using USPS Priority Mail-the cost that is charged is the same versus having to wait four weeks for your purchases.  Not only using USPS Priority Mail to speed up delivery, using Priority Mail will ensure a much better chance of deliverys not getting lost.  That has happened twice in regards to books I've purchased through 3rd party retailers.  Amazon, please listen and please do something about shipping by 3rd party retailers who sell their products (books & movies) through you.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|For a very long time, I had put off purchasing any of the \\"Alien\\" movies on video because it always seemed like some change was taking place that would be an improvement over my purchase.  Once the DVD format became popular, it seemed there were at least two different editions of any \\"Alien\\" movie available at any given time.    Then one of my brothers spotted this HUGE (9-disc) boxed set of the four movies, knew I would appreciate it, and sent me a link to Amazon's page for it.  This is what I'd been waiting for, it seems!  Each film is presented in widescreen format in both its original theatrical version and in an alternate version, there are audio commentary tracks, and there are \\"making of\\" videos with all kinds of behind-the-scenes footage.    Whether the alternate versions of the films are actually improved is best left to the viewer (If you really want my opinion, I think \\"Alien\\" was actually improved by the added scene with the cocoon, since until I saw the second film I'd always assumed the alien was simply eating or killing people.  \\"Aliens\\" is not improved much, but it's interesting to see the scenes in which the colony is intact and populated --- before the aliens invade --- as a contrast to its \\"ghost town\\" look later.  \\"Alien 3\\" actually suffers in its alternate version, which is far less gory and more slow-paced than its original release.  And \\"Alien Resurrection\\" has an alternate opening and closing scene that, for all their technical glitz, are actually less interesting than what was in the original film.)    The special features are quite a treat, especially in the case of \\"Alien 3,\\" which I feel is the weakest link in the chain (its high point being the clever means of disposing of the alien).  Apparently, the penal colony was originally going to be a wooden artificial world populated by neo-Luddite monks.  The alien or aliens would ambush them in a wheat-field, a visual reminiscent of the 'raptors in the tall grass in \\"Jurassic Park 2.\\"  One monk would see Ripley as being in league with the Devil.  Thanks to endless script revisions and lack of funds (or lack of enthusiasm?), all that remains is the monk-like brotherhood that the prisoners have formed, and the general lack of high-tech weaponry.    To conclude, I would recommend this set for any fan of the \\"Alien\\" movies who would like to have all the versions, with their respective DVD bells & whistles, all in one box for easy access and comparison.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|This is a great film.  Mark Wahlberg is always reliable for turning in a quality performance so sometimes he can be taken for granted.  Remember how he shocked everyone with his excellent performance in Boogie Nights?  Well here he possesses an amazingly strong constant presence that never lets up.  He is an action adventure superstar.<br /><br />The simple basis of the plot is that he is a shooter for the war/government in retirement and is called upon to undertake a special mission.  That is all I will say for nothing else about this movie is simple.<br /><br />The movie is a high octave full force action thriller and the action sequences are amazing lighting up the screen.  There is graphic violence but it is very well executed and fits the format of the film.  It is not gratuitous.  The film is also a thriller with a strong political edge.  How all this mixes together so expertly is due to the true craftsmen who have put this film together.  And Wahlberg allows the strong esemble cast to shine and does not try to steal the show even though it is totally his.<br /><br />This movie literally blew me away.  I really did love it.  It is over 2 hours in length and the time flew by with action and shocks and plot twist too many to mention.  Highly recommend.
B000002C1W|2.0|One of their worst no doubt, perhaps not as abysmal as some make it out, but does that really say anything? This late 80's backfired comeback is drenched in lifeless production, half-cooked experimentation, and exploited past glories (particularly how Gilmour tries in vain again and again to relive the heights of his \\"Comfortably Numb\\" guitar solo throughout these hollow compositions), producing their definitive over-50 album for tailgate parties.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I heard something on WXPN that stirred me from my coffee and newspaper, but all I caught aside from the almost shape note singing was the name Fleet Foxes. Then someone I've been sharing musical knowledge with put in quite a few good words regarding this and Sun Giants. I eventually got around to picking this up at the local independant music store. I played it through a couple times and threw it on the pile. Then I started hearing it in the distance. A soft baroque chiming in the back of my head. Not the Zombies not Procol Harum nor Left Banke. Oddly rootsy. Sad like the last days of Summer. I ended giving it my full attention and played it over and over with special attention to Hymnal.   It was then I realized that they were the Beach Boys of Winter.
031606792X|5.0|I know many of you are a bit disappointed, but after reading shakespeare, jane austen, the bronte sisters and more i can say this is a really good book, it had a happy ending, and i just loved it. I understand there may be some parts that other fans didn't realy enjoy, but from my point of view, bella got what she deserved, i think Jacob and Renesme were an unexpected but effective twist in the plot, and the fact that Bella got married at 18 is just like any other fairy tale in which the princess gets her charming prince or knight in shinning armor or whatever you want to call it. The danger was present in every moment of the story, and Charlie (if you read between the lines) at some point is going to become what bella must give up because she is going to need to leave at some point soon (cause the time is going to pass and since she can't grow old that's a given) with the excuse that she is going to go to college, and Jacob with them, folowing Renesme, the object of his impinting. Renee is already out of the question since she lives in florida, the land of the sun, so it is quite improbable for Bella to see her again unless Rene would want to visit Forks, which is very unlikely. The story for me is perfect, and I just hope that Stephenie will do as she promised and publish more book from different perspectives because she already said that from Bella's perspective the story was pretty much done and Renesme or Jacob would be a good path to follow, and wait patiently for the release of \\"Midnight Sun\\".  I really enjoyed \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and think of it as the Romeo and Juliet of the 21st century but with the happy ending.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This is the GREATEST album!  It has it all: hard hitting rock, tempo changes, soft rock, classical, percussion, dancing tunes, kick back and just take it all in.  Of course, true to YES form, the lyrics, if analyzed, don't make a lot of sense but they sure do work. Hard to believe that I first listened to it 30 years ago.
B000784WMW|5.0|This is the most faithful adaption of Bronte's Jane Eyre I've seen. The script lifted right out of the book and all of the characterization is dead on. The producers aptly cast Timothy Dalton and Zelda Clark, and I am completley puzzled by the \\"Zelda hate\\" that so crudely peppers the negative reviews. She was certainly not unattractive (calling her ugly is so tacky), nor was she a bad actress, in my opinion she is the best in the roll to date.  The only critiscism I grant the naysayers is in the production quality which leaves something to be desired. One must remember that this was a relativly low budget endeavor and I certainly do not think it materially detracts at all from the enjoyment of this movie.

Both Willie and Win are just tremendous musicians - while neither really sings, their timing when speaking their words is second to none, and really complements the beat.

Instead, I was forced to drink too much and eat a lot of chocolate and tell anyone who would listen what an a-hole my ex was.      I enjoyed reading about the food in Italy, but that was about it.  I was kind of disappointed, after all the good hype about the book.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I just wanted to say how much my family and I enjoyed this movie.  We took our 3 year old son to this movie in the theater (his first time) and he was captivated immediately.  The laughter never stopped, the \\"oohs\\" and \\"ahhs\\" were wonderful, and being a fan of Jack Black didn't hurt either.  You will fall in LOVE with this movie the moment it starts.    Enjoy!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have just looked over a few reviews and read various people moaning about the wrong message being sent and such...So I wanted to defend it a little! I thought the book was an excellent read, and that its not the job of the author to give a \\"message\\". Thats a job for philosophers and preachers. No one asks Stephen Spielberg for a \\"message\\" in his movies. Sometimes there is one, sometimes not, but the point of the exercise is entertainment, not to tell you how to live or send a message to readers about how to behave! And this book delivers a great deal of entertainment and then some. Its my favourite out of the series, and while I agree some parts are a little unrealistic, it is, after all, a book about vampires and werewolves. Hello! Not very realistic right there!  The biggest fault? Its the last in the series, and now I dont have a new one to look forward to. I read it in about 2 days flat, couldnt put it down. To put that in context, I am a fast reader, and I have read everything Stephen King has ever written, JK Rowling, Stephen Donaldson, Jodi Picoult etc etc, as well as much more serious work such as Nietsche, Satre, the Tao Te Ching etc etc. Some books are for learning from, some are for fun. This is for fun, and was easily the best thing I have read in ages, and I have recommended it to everyone I know!

1595141715|5.0|At first, I just read the book jacket and was intrigued by the premise: A girl who had commited suicide left behind tapes of the thirteen things that drove her to such a sad end for those who had caused them.     Then, I started reading the novel and could just not put it down. Jay Asher has come up with such and interesting premise and has managed to be a talented enough writer to carry through with it. It was so heartfelt, dramatic, gut-wrenching and just all-around good. What's more, unlike many young adult books, the ending completely blew me away. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was fascinating and just so gosh-darn enthralling.    Seriously. Buy it and read it. You won't regret it.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I adore Dustin Hoffman and count him as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen, and even though his recent choices are less than impressive (what has happened to these acting giants; ala Robert De Niro and Al Pacino?) I am still enamored by just about everything he's done pre-2000.  His comedic performance in `Tootsie' is certainly one of his grandest.<br /><br />Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a hard to get along with actor who cannot seem to find work because of his reputation.  His talent precedes him but his arrogance and stubbornness have caused him to become unwanted.  With this weighting heavily over his head, and the desire to help his friend launch his own stage-play, Dorsey decides to go undercover (way undercover) to get a job, and so that is how Dorothy Michaels comes about, a hotheaded older woman who nabs the new role on a soap.  Her success is instantaneous, fans flocking to her and costars befriending her, not the least of which is Julie Nichols who also manages to catch Dorsey's eye.<br /><br />The main plot of Dorsey falling for Nichols but being unable to confess his feelings for her without compromising his paycheck really play second fiddle to the real meat of Dorsey's transformation while disguised as Michaels.  Dorsey is able to separate himself from his actions and view the world through a new set of eyes, waking himself to his own inadequacies, but also giving strength to his female fans, on and off the screen, to fight against the stereotypes that bind them so tightly.<br /><br />The performances are all outstanding, especially from Hoffman who is not only hilarious but also very connected to the emotional journey both of his characters are going through.  Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her performance, and while I don't consider it `amazing' it was tender and genuine and deserving of admiration (but I'm not so sure of an Oscar).  Actually, second to Hoffman is Charles Durning who really should have nabbed a nomination for his wonderfully complete portrayal of Nichols lonely father Les, who happens to take a liking to Dorothy.  His performance is so sincere and moving that the Academy should be ashamed for passing him over.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is also wonderful, from the late Sydney Pollack to Teri Garr, Bill Murray and a pre-stardom Geena Davis.<br /><br />The script is brilliantly crafted to be both comedic and heartwarming, and when the Dorsey/Michaels revelation is finally revealed you will find yourself on the floor in the most painfully side splitting uproarious laughter that you will feel compelled to watch the whole film all over again just so you can see that scene in all its glory (you have to watch the whole film for a proper setup).  Hoffman and company really deliver a film that is more than just a comedy, it is a landmark and one of the most influential and recognizable films to the 80's.s wonderfully complete portrayal of Nichols lonely father Les, who happens to take a liking to Dorothy.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|The role of Emma is played perfectly by Gweneth Paltrow. She's delightful as the failed matchmaker of Austen's story, wading through social decorum of ill fated as well as perfectly-matches romances. The rest of the cast shines as well, particularly the role of Mrs. Elton who, among other things, recognizes a \\"shocking lack of satin.\\"    Wonderful settings and costumes, this is a version I could watch again and again. Recommended for all Austen fans.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I hope we'll see more of this mini movies, though it seems for a story like that, a 4 hours movie could have been better. Yet, it's a fantastic storyline, exploring new ways allowing us however to see all of our favorite teams seens over the years while the show was on.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I don't claim to be an expert on the novels of Jane Austen and don't judge this adaptation according to the original story or any previous versions. Focusing on this 2005 film version starring Keira Knightly as Elizabeth, I found it filled with beauty, romance, music and breathtaking scenery. The casting is nearly perfect as each of the characters comes to life in a highly believable manner. Knightly does an extraordinary job at expressing her love of her sisters (even the kooky younger girls) and her father, along with her initial distaste for Darcy.    I particularly enjoyed the peformances of Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennett, and the appearance of Dame Judy Dench. It's a championship moment when Elizabeth stands up to her in the middle of the night--as good as her romantic scenes with Darcy.    Everything about this film make it a period piece that completely capsulizes a point in time and a classic work of fiction. I will watch it again and again and again.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Once again, like Continuum, I could have gone easily on a 4 or 6 hours wrap for it seems they did lack of time in this dvd to make it all wrap up,yet, the storyline is rather excellent and a fantastic way to wrap up the Ori story, left unfinished on season 10. The introduction shall allow many who don't know the series to at least catch up with season 10 finale in order to understand better that movie. the bonus are also fantastic

B0013D8LOU|3.0|I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan & I had to replace my old copy of Sweeney Todd. So I purchased a new copy. In the description it said DVD was brand new & when I recieved the DVD it was in wrap but the DVD it self had scratches. When I played the DVD it skipped about three times. Thank God I have a DVD scratch cleaner if not I would have sent it back. Shipping was very fast also.
031606792X|4.0|I really enjoyed the first three books and was kind of upset when I started reading reviews for Breaking Dawn before I got a chance to read it.  I think that the series ended pretty well, and I am going to point out things I enjoyed about the book and the things I was not so fond of:    Note: there are some spoilers ahead.    1) I really did not like the fact that a portion of the book was written from Jacob's perspective.  I have never been a big Jacob fan at all because he just seems like a young punk to me, but I am curious as to why Stephenie didn't write that section of the book from Edward's perspective.  I am way more interested in seeing what he was thinking about the pregnancy and whatnot.    2) I read a few reviews were people were absolutely slamming Bella because she was so happy about being pregnant and her perspective changed so drastically so quickly and how unrealistic it is.  Well, when I found out that my husband and I were pregnant with our first child, and it was a complete surprise, I pretty much went from shock and awe to \\"wow, I am going to be a mommy!\\" so I don't see what the big fuss is about her reaction.    3) There were also a lot of reviews out there that didn't understand why Bella called Rosalie when she realized she was pregnant.  It's simple:  she KNEW that Rosalie would defend her and the unborn baby to the end if need be because Rosalie could relate to her in that moment.  It wasn't that Bella was being mean or insensitive, she called the one person who would help her regardless of what Edward or Carlisle wanted because that was all Rosalie wanted for her human life.    4) I liked the character of the baby.  A lot.  She is quite entertaining and unnerving to read about!    5) People were also saying things about how the baby's name didn't make sense: without ruining it for those who haven't read the book, the baby's first name is a combination of Bella's mom's name and Esme's name, and her middle name is a combination of Carlisle and Becca's dad's name.  It makes sense to me; she was including the parents in it.    6) Bella seemed to grow as a character when she became pregnant and a vampire.  It was entertaining to read about how her views changed with both things, and I really liked how it ended.    All in all, it was worth 4 stars and I would recommend it.
0743544676|4.0|Helpful to me as I need reminding that it's a waste of my time to pursue a man. If it's not going to happen, it's not going to happen.  Why stick with someone that is half into the relationship?  Book discourages women to be the pursuers which I needed to hear.  On my second read, I skipped the parts that definitely did not pertain to me.
0517227851|5.0|I could read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" over and over again, and this edition is perfect for doing so. It is beautiful and simple, with no extra content-excepting a short biography of the author-a detail that makes it better for carrying around with you than bulkier annotated versions. The ribbon bookmark is pretty and useful, and the print, surprisingly, is large enough to be read easily. The only fault I could find with this edition were a few minor typos; nothing of importance, and easily forgotten while caught up in the completely perfect story.
0393330435|5.0|I bought this book about a year ago when I had recently been laid off and wanted to introduce some new ideals into my brain.    I read the Second Coming of Steve Jobs, which showed how a man can be a cutthroat and succeed.    iWoz however, shows how a man can find success doing something he loves, and not get hung up on money or power.    After initially reading the book I thought it was kind of blah, but after seeing more of Woz in person and in various bios, I truly appreciate how genius he truly is.    Excellent read for anyone seeking innovation and drive, because Woz clearly has it!
B000O176Q6|5.0|Bruce lee's creative and outstanding performance is highlighted in this extraordinary movie. This is his finest quality performance exhibiting his Legendary skills which were ahead of his time and even to this day still inspiring and engaging. The beginning of the film where he spars Sammo Hung is an awesome setting for what is to come in the movie. What sets Bruce a part from all of the rest is his character energy and his extraordinary power and speed from such a small framed man. Now that Enter the Dragon is in Blueray, it is sheer pleasure and excitement as on the big screen!  What a legendary Martial Artist, actor and human being!!!
031606792X|5.0|The fourth installment of the Twilight series was great. Stephenie did a great job putting the loose ends together and ending the series with a happy ending for Bella's family. Having the book split into three parts was awesome, especially to get to read through Jacob's point of view and get his thoughts of what was going on in his head while Bella went through her pregancy. I can't wait for the next book, Midnight Sun to get to read Twilight all over again but in Edward's point of view. All in all the books were great and I loved them.
0440243661|5.0|Very please with the condition of the book, the promptness<br />of service,<br />Donn Doyle
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Love the album overall, but not the way all of the songs sounded.  The cast of the movie was wonderful, and I love Pierce Brosnan, but I'm guessing he was not cast for his singing ability. Buy it anyway.  It's worth it!
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is an amazing read!! The first of the three books, was very well written, leaving you in suspense and awe at what just happened!!! Book three was a little more difficult reading it from the point of view she wrote it from......but I think personally it was because I wanted to be back with Bella and Edward and get more juice on what was really happening. Book three was still very well written. It gave us a peek and many of the events that were going on that we could not have seen otherwise!!!! Plus we saw Bella from a side we really haven't seen her from before. Book three was the cherry on top!! It was so meaty and juicy!!! And Stephenie really was able to give us shock, and.....what we all wanted to happen. A lot of us wanted Bella and Edward to be together forever, but we wanted Jacob to be happy as well!!!! And some of you wanted Jacob and Bella to be together for ever, but for Edward to not suffer. In a way I believe we all got a bit of what we wanted out of the story.   I started reading reviews today, and was shocked at what I saw....some people have really written some nasty things. So ask yourself what it is that you wanted out of the books.......you cannot expect this book to highlight all of your #1 priorities or standards for young adults to follow. So Stepheni picked out some very, very good ones for all young adults to follow. She made it clear that while education is important and a must...that family will always come first. She makes it clear that a young girl and a young mans innocence is of the upmost importance....no matter how tempting it is!!!   Stephenie Meyer is an amazing author....I have over 500 books in my collection, and she in my opinion is even with my other favorite author..Tolkien. An ordinary author can describe a scene so you know what it looks like. Stephenie Meyer doesn't just describe a scene....she paints it for you, so that you feel it, and breath it, and feel like you are there while it is happening!!!! She is a young author, who is only going to get better with time!!
B00082ZS5W|4.0|If you like Dido, you need this DVD/CD. The band is excellent. Dido's voice is smooth and soothing as usual, and the more you watch the concert, the more you will like the music. The addition of back-up singers would be a real plus in my opinion, but all in all, a great performance.
0321544080|4.0|This is an interesting book, filled with beatiful photos and first hand explanations of how they were taken.  It is well written and interesting reading for any photographer.  However the photographer used a small truck load of lighting equipment for almost every shot, so it is not of much instructional use to a photographer who does not posses, or is willing to rent, an almost unlimited amount of flash lighting equipment for every photographic session.
1844137872|5.0|there isn't much to read. the art speaks for itself.   6 sections to this book:   monkeys, cops, rats, cows, art, and street furniture.   there are a few pages that contain several paragraphs of writing. banksy provides captions for maybe.. approximately half or less than half of his art. towards the back  there's one page with \\"advice on painting with stencils\\". if you were looking for graffiti instruction, look elsewhere... unless you really want to look at that one page haha. some of his famous quotes are in there.   what a funny guy. funny book. it was worth the money :)
B000ZN802W|5.0|I have a feeling Sean Penn and I wouldn't be \\"best buds\\". But I loved this movie.    Almost every scene is suitable for framing. I can't recall the last time I saw such cinematography. The movie's appeal is on so many levels for me. It probably will appeal to you on other levels as well.     My surprise hero? Vince Vaughn. This guy can do more with three sentences than most actors with a script. It's a shame we see him mostly in comedies or quirky roles.     The lasting memories I carry with me about this movie are that if you decide to go down \\"the road less traveled\\" there's a real chance that you won't be coming back.     Don't waste your time renting this movie. Buy it, you'll want to see it many times.     PS-If the trailer didn't get you, forget everything else I said.
1591841216|5.0|Great book, easy to read, great information about taking risk in your life, highly reccomended...
B000OY8NII|5.0|Excellent!  I was glad to be able to catch up on all the episodes I missed.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I love Coldplay.. and  I love Coldplay even more live!! Chris' voice is absolutely perfect, and the rest of the group is amazing! This is a great addition to any Coldplay fan's collection.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Straight up! My friend is the biggest maggot of life and when I heard All hope is gone I thought this album was going to suck a serious one.. A fan of Sub. Verses 3, I was skeptical, I heard it from TOP TO BOTTOM and THIS ALBUM IS CRAZY!!     FOR SURE you have to get used to this album, you CANNOT judge this album on first listen or first day for that matter, you have to get used to the concept of EVERY song and you have to let it grow on you for you to REALLY appreciate the work of art that Slipknot has created.. and the truth of the matter is the best songs on this album are the ones i didn't expect!!!    Songs to hear (In my opinion)  Gematria  Psychosocial  BUTCHER'S HOOK (!@#4ING AMAZING)  All Hope is Gone    Very good album! DO NOT be caught in the negative hype.. LISTEN WITH OPEN EARS.. (That's what music is about)
B0016NF06O|2.0|I think the CD is okay...I never enjoy live CD performances because of the audience clapping. I like both performers but not necessarily together.
0930289234|5.0|This is an excellent book, I encourage you to buy it today!<br /><br />Most comic books are shallow, ridiculous stories with flat, uninteresting characters.  The issues are painted in black and white and one side is explicitly presented as the side of absolute Good.  The Watchmen is different.  The story is multifaceted and the characters are much more complicated than they first appear (In fact, I also recommend that you read the book at least twice!).  There is no faction in the Watchmen that can claim a monopoly on \\"Truth, Justice, and the American Way,\\" and no assumption that this is desirable or even possible.  Without qualification, this is the best book I have read for pleasure in a very long time.
0307346609|4.0|A good effort I must say it in short describes zombie warfare first the outbrack then the panic that follows and finally the determination with which the remaining uninfected population fight back against the invader.  There is also almost none of this \\"superman syndrome\\" stuff that permeates everything Science Fiction related these days.  Over the course of the narrative it is clear that if humanity is going to survive it is going to have to fight as a team.      If I had to pick my two favorite installments it's the exploits of one professional bodyguard on a \\"Long Island\\" near New York basically a morality tale about how celebrity is irrelevant in the new world and the story of how Cuba of all places becomes the \\"arsenal of victory\\".  If some point of views like the former computer nerd and Hiroshima survivor that become the guardians of Japan seem far fetched...well it is a book about zombies and if I were writing a book about the subject I'd have some fun with it too.        It is an excellent book providing a balanced account of the war from all fronts from land based armies to people who spent the entire war on the Open Ocean and even outer space.  I would even go so far as to say that it was too short I wanted more.      If I have one compliant however is that whereas most books that run along this kind of theme are usually hampered by a single viewpoint this one while it is good is too cosmopolitan.  It seemed that I was just getting to like one character then that point of view would end and we would be on to someone else a different theater of the war.  This is not a bad things its just sometimes it can be abrupt.      Overall-Wonderful book I look forward to further installments if there are any.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Bought this cd and love all of the songs. Including great ones I hadn't heard on the radio.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Ok, I only caught this show half way threw it's first season and have now seen all of season 1. I love, love, love, this show. As a 40 year old gay GEEK male. I have always had a twisted sense of humor. This show hit's my kind of humor perfect. I am part of these guys are, in the way they act and the things the find funy. I love to see there interaction between \\"NORMAL\\" people, which makes for a very funny show.<br /><br />I want me a replica HG Wells Time Machine. LOL!!!
B00004YM0D|5.0|Even if, by some odd reason, you didn't love the movie, the soundtrack is an excellent compilation of great tunes. Not one bad song on the CD. Great CD for your car if you drive a lot. M :)
B00081U7HC|5.0|\\"Pretty Woman\\" harks back to various well-trodden themes: the Pygmalion legend, the prostitute with a heart of gold, and the poor soul who teaches the wealthy person the true values in life. Julia Roberts is a hooker who is rescued from life on the streets by the wealthy and ruthless business tycoon Richard Gere, and she rescues him from a life of reckless power and greed by teaching him business ethics and morality. The audience, because of the acting, the L.A. setting, and the clever way the film was produced and directed, willingly suspends disbelief and accepts this adult fairy tale with its very suggestive sexual action and dialogue.<br /> The film is well done and was very successful partly because of the romantic chemistry or alchemy that comes across in the love affair between Roberts and Gere. The scene in which Roberts is spellbound by \\"La Traviata\\" proves to Gere that she is a sensitive soul. (In that opera a hooker also falls for a wealthy man.) The way the two meet seems far-fetched. Do wealthy people really talk about and show off their wealth the way he does? And are they so lacking in street smarts?<br />Just scratch below the surface, and this hooker and tycoon are both nice people. It's a very watchable fairy tale. Great if you don't stop to analyze too much. Even the manager of the luxury hotel has a heart of gold. Just enjoy this Cinderella meets King Midas cotton candy of a movie.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This recording is a winner from start to finish.  They pulled up a feeling from the past and put a   21st century punch to it. By the end of this recording   you are floating. Really a nice feel to Yoshimi.
B0007TKH66|5.0|We've been talking about ordering this for a long time and couldn't decide between individual seasons and the boxed set.  After reading many reviews with problems people had with sets being foreign releases, we opted for the individual season.  It was exactly what we expected and we're having fun watching it and looking forwarding to ordering the following seasons!  Shipped in the time frame expected and received ptomptly.  Thanks!
0143038419|4.0|That said, this book is really entertaining!  She does a fabulous job in Italy, but Indonesia is by far the best, most moving part.  A little disappointed in Bali because i wanted it to culminate with something more meaningful than her getting laid finally.  Nevertheless, lovely book and charming writer. I'd love to travel with her sometime and can't wait to see how they do the movie!  Enjoy!!!
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|I have to start off by saying this is the first Coldplay CD I have ever bought.  I am familiar with their past hits, but their patented brand of Travis-influenced sleepy-time piano balladry never quite did it for me.  That's why I was surprised to hear \\"Violet Hill\\" and \\"Viva La Vida\\" which, in my opinion, sound totally different than anything I have heard them do before.  Two great songs, but yet an uneven album which yields a couple more good songs, but that's pretty much it.  You get the sense that the band is trying to prove that they can do something different on this record, and it succeeds partly because how great \\"Volet Hill\\" and \\"Viva La Vida\\" are, but they are definitely the two best songs on the album.  However, it doesn't feel permanent or authentic - I feel they will revert back to their original sound on future albums.  You also get the sense that this album is trying to be BIG, like U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\" or something.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite cut it.
B000002BHE|5.0|This is such an inspirational CD!  I love her voice, especially in number 3 - if you're a ballroom dancer, this is a beautiful Rumba! There are a couple other Rumbas worth listening to as well.  Please give it a whirl first and you'll be enchanted by her, even if this is some of her early work.
0307269191|5.0|For a number of years, I was a big Murakami fan. Then a few of his books disappointed me so much, I sort of 'fell out of love' with his work. This non-fiction work appealed to me and I'm glad I purchased it. In fact, I purchased the audible version which is great. It reminds me a lot of Stephen King's \\"On Writing,\\" which is half about living your life, half about the art of writing. I pulled a lot of useful information from this book that I won't soon forget. Don't expect some grand climax to this book, however. For what it is, I think it's a great book and a short read (or listen if you're on audio)
B001BGTWXI|2.0|I pre-ordered the album months ago(though I have yet to recieve it yet, I heard the songs online already), bought front section seats to Mayhem, and followed slipknot closely ever since they released the news of their new CD release and tour....    I did not really know much about slipknot until the release of Vol. 3 Subliminal Verses...  When a friend of mine played it, I immediately fell in love with the band, and bought the album for myself, then begun to explorer their previous work, which I liked better and better...  IF you ask me, every year they seem to lose alittle something...  Their first album to me is by far their best with songs like Scissors, and Prosthetics...  The mellowest songs was probably Wait and Bleed...  And still relatively a hard punching song...  The thing I fell most in love with about Slipknot was their style...  They made it clear they were a 9 piece band in their music...  They had a sound developed that was unique, aggressive, different....  All their sound effects, and crafty lyrics, which by the way, they have a pretty complex vocabulary, it all made them the band that earned them the rep they have today....  Most of all I love how Corey Taylor could sing, scream, and sing while screaming....  They had the perfect mixture of melody, aggression, it caught your attention, and revved you up...  Even in their mellower songs like circles, vermillion pt. 2, they still sounded good...  They managed to pull off melodic acoustics, yet maintain some sense of style that still screamed \\"hey, this is Slipknot\\"....    This new album has severely disappointed me...  Maybe the fact this being the first album of theirs I had a chance to look forward to being released, and had high hopes...  As I stated, I started to listen to Slipknot when Vol. 3 came out...  By then, I was playing catch up...  I never had to wait, never had a chance to have any expectations....    The music on their newest release is....  ok at best....  and only if it came from some other band....  But the fact this is Slipknot....  I felt let down...  in a big way...  Take the song Vendetta for instance...  That song nearly sounds semi country....  And worse, it seems to me they captured the sounds from other bands....  Lyrics like \\"Are you ready for the time of your life\\"....  Sounds like Rev Theory....  And what ever happened to \\"I'm gonna slit your throat, and F**k the wound\\".....  This album seems to me, many main stream radio stations can play these songs....  Most Slipknot songs from other albums are too \\"hard\\" for the radio...  But this new album almost fits in the \\"Easy Music\\" section....  They lost their aggression, they lost sound style, they got soft, and though still spit out alot of complex vocabulary, many of their songs almost sound forced and rushed...  I feel Corey Taylor lied when he said quote \\"This Album will rip your face off\\" end quote....  Maybe I misunderstood...  Maybe he really said \\"It'll make you want to rip your face off\\"....  This album simply is not Slipknot....  In fact, several of the songs I hear a resemblance to other bands such as Stone sour (somewhat), Rev Theory, Godsmack, maybe alittle Metallica, Korn, even papa roach...  Even some 80's sounds...  And Vendetta...  Sounds country like...  For those who like Wrestling (Im not a huge fan, but my brothers are), my brother states Vendetta sounds like \\"RVD's old entrance song\\"...  Ive never heard the song before nor do I know who made it, much less really who RVD is....  But as a point made....    Slipknot drastically changed in this album, and it changes how I look at them drastically...  They being one of my favorite bands have sunk alittle...  Maybe they'll fix this with a better album release....  Or come out and state they were just kidding us with this album....  Joey Joridison even stated this album being their best of work, finally having the sound he's always want slipknot to sound like....  I hope not...    Maybe there are some Maggots out there satisfied with this album, but I venture to say the vast majority are disappointed, or just happy we got at least something from Slipknot released in 4 yrs....  But this is not what I imagined it was going to be as I counted down the days until All Hope is gone was released....  The early release of Psychosocial really did throw everyone off...  Even Psychosocial sounds a bit less like the Slipknot we all know from their past albums....  but at least Psychosocial semi captures Slipknot's style in a little way...  The music video is awesome too....  But it truly is the cream of the crop on this album.    I just can't imagine the 9 of them head banging or even playing in their mean looking masks to any of this music on their new album in concert...  this will probably bring about a huge change in seeing them live...   I hope they get alot of negative reviews, and not because I hate them, but I hope they notice we were unsatisfied and they bring back the old stuff....  Maybe they should have remained in Los Angeles for recording, rather then moving to Iowa...  Should have kept some of their old producers....  Funny though, to me anyhow, every album seems to get worse...  Their first album and Iowa being the best....  And Subliminal Verses being pretty good....  But this new Album just lost it....  I have to agree with the fact maybe theyre beginning to sell out...      As I said, this album is at best \\"ok\\", if and only if it came from some other band....  But I had higher expectations....  Not that Slipknot plays to please my expectations...  But this is generally what Ive been hearing as well...    Just too drastic of a change too fast....  then again, what can we expect from the psychotic looney bin Slipknot portrayed when they're all approaching 40 years of age...  There is a time they will have to let go...  Too bad they spend long periods of time between albums...    I will miss the creepy sound effects the most...  They hardly sound like a 9 piece band anymore...They defiantly slowed down
B00006AW2L|5.0|AFTERMATH was a major departure for The Rolling Stones.  Their previous albums (three in Britain, five in the US) were mostly covers, sprinkled with a few Jagger-Richards originals.  AFTERMATH contains all original material, and some of the best the Stones would ever do.  It was also their first album to be recorded in stereo, and although it doesn't have the production sheen of The Beatles, the Stones' music was never meant to be that clean.<br /><br />The British release featured a different cover photograph, kicked off with \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" instead of \\"Paint It Black\\" and included three tracks which were left off the U.S. version.  While the British edition gives you more songs for your buck, I still prefer the American edition.  Perhaps this is because I grew up with it, but it still feels better sequenced, more concise and coherent, and above all, consistently bluesy.<br /><br />\\"Paint It Black\\" is simply a better song than \\"Mother's Little Helper.\\" Although Brian Jones is playing sitar, giving the song an Eastern feel, underneath the surface it's pure, dark, deep, brooding Delta Blues.  It flows naturally into the nasty, snarky, strutting \\"Stupid Girl\\".  \\"Lady Jane\\" owes more to Elizabethan music than to the blues, but the sardonic, icy bitterness fits neatly with the first two songs.  The Stones then up the ante further for the classic \\"Under My Thumb\\", which like \\"Heart of Stone\\" and \\"Satisfaction\\" is boasting and arrogant on the surface, ambivalent, brooding and somber underneath.  \\"Doncha Bother Me\\" is one of the finest blues in the Stones' catalogue, featuring blistering harmonica by Brian Jones and some of Jagger's finest lyrics.<br /><br />After this staggering opening salvo, the rest of the songs hold up well, covering a wide variety of musical styles, including an early foray into country in \\"High and Dry\\", and concludes with the brilliant \\"Goin' Home\\", whose final three notes are as effective an ending as has ever appeared on a rock album.<br /><br />And there's another reason for my preferring the American edition:  \\"Goin' Home\\" belongs at the end of the record.  Of the three extra tracks, only \\"Out of Time\\" is a real classic.  \\"Take it or Leave it\\" is aptly titled.  \\"What to Do\\" is pleasant enough, but hardly indispensable.<br /><br />This is one of rock music's greatest achievements.  If you're only familiar with later Stones work such as SOME GIRLS and TATTOO YOU, you should give this record a listen, especially if you dig the blues.son for my preferring the American edition:  \\"Goin' Home\\" belongs at the end of the record.

031606792X|1.0|To be honest this was not my favorite book in the series. I thought that the hype preceeding its release was absolutely ridiculous after I finished reading it. And the hassle with amazon did not help.
1582701709|1.0|I am very thankful I just checked this book out from the library. This book just reitterates common sense. This book talks in circles stating the same thing over and over and over again. Very boring to read, and poorly written. Don't buy this book, it would be a waste of money!
1416562591|5.0|Terrific book that rings of truth. It is quite possible that it's impossible to create a capitalist society without some form of slavery. The White Tiger, with its \\"been there, done that\\", clear eyed, unromantic insights into all levels of Indian society, does nothing to contradict that proposition. And it's funny and entertaining, too.
0789318121|5.0|This wonderful book contains the full shooting script of \\"The Dark Knight\\". You also get pretty wonderful sketches of items like the Batpod and Tumbler, and full color shots of the entire movie spread out while reading the screenplay. While reading through the screenplay, you can get a sense of what the actors must capture in their performances through the written word. And in the Batman world, you know that, \\"The taste for the theatrics\\" is the norm here.
0671027344|5.0|It took me nearly four years to get around to reading this book and it was definitely worth the wait. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing story that follows a scared and lonely teenage boy through his freshman year of high school: making friends, \\"discovering\\" girls, developing an identity, and holding on for dear life in a world much unlike anything he's ever encountered before. For anyone who has ever experienced high school, the book reminds readers just how scary, new and amazing high school can be. The book is a quick read (just over 200 pages) and written in a friendly format that instantly makes the reader empathize with the main character. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a wonderful story that will make you laugh, cry, and reminisce on the good old days of high school. I highly recommend this book.
B0010VD7EO|2.0|First of all, MGMT?  Is that \\"Management?\\" \\"Meenage Gutant Minja Turtles?\\" \\"Mey Gight Me Tiants?\\"  Beats the hell out of me, and their website (\\"whoismgmt\\") is no help, either.<br /><br />The album title, well, seems to be communicating some sort of remarkable event involving an oracle, or one that is, by inference mystical and difficult to interpret.  Me, I think they just thought it sounded clever, and it rhymed, too.  The depth of this title was not reflected in the music.<br /><br />And what is this ridiculous promise of \\"multi-dimensional vibrating Technicolor sounds?\\"  That's a pretty tall order, and I took up the challenge.  I listened, carefully, living with this release in the car for two straight weeks.  I heard absolutely nothing that I would characterize as multi-dimensional.  I'd reserve that for King Crimson's [[ASIN:B00065MDT0 Beat]] or Eno's [[ASIN:B000E5N634 My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]].  And vibrating Technicolor sound?  Well, I heard absolutely nothing that got me close to that.  For me, I'd lavish this compliment on Andreas Vollenweider's [[ASIN:B000BBRDC6 White Winds]] or Mark Isham's brilliant, lavish themes for [[ASIN:B0000DJYNP The Cooler]].<br /><br />The album art had me shaking my head before I even got the disc into the player.  The front photo is the duo of VanWyngarden and Goldwasser at the beach, tricked out in face paint and tied-on rave-junk, right down to the pathetic lightsticks, bad hair, vacant stares, thin and on so self-importantly trendy (these are shots from the video).  The back cover art has them and their art-cool friends throwing flares into the sea, and the inside art has these deeply self-affected artistes all painted, in a studio, setting fire...wait for it...to play money--whoa!  I mean, puh-leeze.  What a load of stereotypical art-poser glop.  Strangely enough, the online art that is generated automatically for your ripped versions of this release is considerably different than that described above.<br /><br />The website does tell me an awful lot more than the album does, either in the music itself, or in liner notes.  The liner notes are a sad and sorry letdown.  One side is a big spiral, like an old-timey, cheapo hypnotism prop, and the other side is a genuinely crappy, and ultimately obnoxious run of the songs' lyrics, with no song titles, just jumbled-up bunches of words, in someone's bad, tiny handwriting.  Artist: if you're going to offer lyrics, making them legible is a good rule of thumb.  What's offered is a condescending, cynical swipe at us as consumers of their product.<br /><br />(Oh, and by the way, the website is a low-budget mess, pretending at some kind of post-pop art statement.  The link to the merchandise works just fine, though.)<br /><br />Ah, but these wild \\"mystic pagans,\\" these Connecticut college boys are all about breaking rules, and, y'know, defying stuff, n' all.  So where's that in this music?  Oh yeah, the music.  On almost all tracks, the voices are under and slightly behind the music, and that's because they can't sing.  Although, from time to time, early Mick Jagger seems to be the vocal model, thin and pushed.  That's an interesting vocal approach, but it does not fit in any way with the music they're making, and the low-rent artsy-techno vibe they are creating.  The lyrics are trite and predictable, talking about living fast and dying young, getting jobs in offices, \\"the kids\\" this and \\"the kids\\" that, etc.  No track did anything for me, and believe me, I gave this album plenty of time to grow on me, playing it in my car nonstop for two straight weeks.  In the end, I had to flush their music out of my head; an eclectic dose of [[ASIN:B000001IQH ...And Out Come the Wolves]], [[ASIN:B000MGBR6S Marathon]], [[ASIN:B000FAOC68 One-Two Punch]] and [[ASIN:B000002PEY Paint Your Wagon]] did the trick.<br /><br />Overall, the entire package comes across as trite.  It's predictable electronic pop; all these guys are doing is following a formula.  Hell, they go so far as to cop to it on the website.  And it's not even good formula.  It sounds like a high-school knock-off.<br /><br />The album's bonus info was weak and lame.  The interactive video for \\"Electric Feel\\" didn't work, as I couldn't find it on the difficult to navigate interactive front page.  It did not come up with the autostart on the CD, and I couldn't uncover a hyperlink to it on the front page.  That's poor design, or poor quality control.  The tour photo album was ultra-low-budget in production and resolution, just stupid buddy photos, the kind of junk you shoot with your camera phone.  The photos from the \\"Time to Pretend\\" video shoot were better in resolution, but sad in their amateurish pretense at art.  This was not very impressive for product value-added.<br /><br />These guys recently played the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC, and the Post's Patrick Foster was not impressed, calling them \\"perfectly good at being bad.\\"  He said they \\"look(ed) and sound(ed) both utterly incompetent and completely catchy.\\"  Foster points out, and I'd figured it out even before I read this slam of a review, that MGMT's big \\"hit,\\" \\"Time to Pretend,\\" isn't some cynical riff; it's an admission of where they really are.  Maybe that's art, but it doesn't come off very well musically.  It's all echo and synths, overdone, with the vocals intentionally buried way down in the noise.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I didn't enjoy this music, and didn't enjoy the entire package this \\"band\\" is pushing at me.  It's not the worst I've ever heard--save that for [[ASIN:B000000DBT Redbone Greatest Songs]].  I can't recommend it.t's not even good formula.  It sounds like a high-school knock-off.

B001DDBCUU|5.0|Something tells me our earnest reviewer below, on page 4 of reviews,  Andy Boy knows of what he speaks: an adolescent romp, he says, indeed. You've had just loads of adolescent romps, haven't you laddie ? LOL.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I bought this album based on the strength of I'm Yours, the 2nd track. However, I've fallen in love with the entire thing... some of the songs are sweet, some are sad, some are thought-provoking, some are just plain sexy! I've been listening each day and the album keeps growing on me. I especially appreciate Mraz's positive outlook on life (\\"I guess it's again my turn to win some and learn some...\\" - from I'm Yours). Buy the whole album, not just 1 or 2 tracks. You won't regret it!
031606792X|5.0|Other than Amazon sucking (no pun intended) at their shipping, the book was great.  But, while I waited for the pre-ordered book for 5 days after it was released, I read other people's reviews. It was so sad how they slammed the author and compared her to JK Rowling. The Twilight series was the imagination of a wonderful author. She gave us a gift, a beautifully written story about love and pain. She even made her world as perfect as all of us wish ours could be. If you want to \\"live\\" a different \\"life\\" for a bit, try reading the full series. SM did a great job!   Note: For those who were slamming SM about some misspellings and comparing her to JK Rowling's works, you should reread all the Harry Potter books. They too have their misspellings. Both authors are great writers writing different stories. Grow up and just enjoy someone else's imagination.
B000EWBKLC|5.0|Well, for starters I can say it is one of the best franchises ever, not only because the \\"killer\\" has a real good motive for \\"killing\\" people, and it isn't like most of the genres were the killer is \\"just insane\\" and does it just for \\"fun\\"...also, no matter how well you think you have figured out the genre you will have a lot of surprises in all the movies of SAW, for me its simply one of the best movies ever and if you have a chance to see the other ones you wont get disappointed, but I have to say that they are more of the \\"gore genre\\" than the scary genre... never the less still a great movie franchise. I highly recommend them.

6305313687|4.0|I have seen this movie about 5 times and like it more and more whenever I watch it. I bought this movie as a gift for my girlfriend(nothing says I love you more than American History X =P)because she as well liked the movie so I figured it would be a good gift. Anyways, all I have to say is that it is a good movie focusing on a person who committed a hate crime and tells his tale from beginning to end. If you have not seen it, go either rent or buy it. You will not be disappointed.

B000089J0R|5.0|\\"Valley of the Damned\\" (2003) is the debut album from epic power metal band DragonForce. DragonForce has two standout guitarists, Sam Totman and Herman Li, and you won't find more solos for your money anywhere. DragonForce plays faster than anybody else out there, and it gives them their own distinct style.<br /><br />\\"Valley of the Damned\\" is up there in quality with any of their subsequent releases - there are a handful of great songs on here. Lyrics tend to be in the upbeat, fantasy-themed (although not as egregiously fantasy-themed as most power metal bands), battle and overcoming evil veins.<br /><br />Nobody plays power metal as fast as DragonForce. Given, they haven't evolved much between this album and \\"Ultra Beatdown\\" (2008), but this is a great debut, if you like any of their other material, you'll like this.
6305428220|5.0|Usually movies about aliens don't appeal well to me, but this is the only major exception. It's great for a sci-fi movie of its time, and it never gets old. Hopefully someday they'll release it with the deleted scenes!
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for years. After Subliminal Verses I was apprehensive but All Hope Is Gone is really good.    These songs are definately a mix of all four previous albums. You can hear influence from smash-you-in-the-face of IOWA to the chaotic and break neck speed of the early days to the more pop influenced Verses. There is also a Stone Sour influence, which I don't mind.    However the song Dead Memories and Child of Burning Time(bonus track) are a dissapointment. But not enough to make me regret buying the album.    A really good but not amazing effort by the Nine.

B0011N1WE8|4.0|Ah..., don't you absolutely love stories about ancient family curses that are eventually broken by the affirmation of true love? Of course you do, everybody does. Well the '08 film 'Penelope' is one of those fairy tale like tales that the whole family can enjoy. Christina Ricci stars as Penelope, the pig faced young recluse burdened with the family curse and James McAvoy  is perfectly cast in the role of her would-be suitor and potential curse breaker.<br /><br />While the story line begins to unfold as we've come to expect in most traditional fairy tales you just might be surprised at the clever, completely unexpected twist at the end. Loads of entertainment value here complimented by some unique visual elements sure to catch the attention of the audience.

0743298039|4.0|Very well written book -- original and compelling story, characters and subplot. I loaned my 1st copy to friends and never got it back, so I bought a 2nd copy to read again!
0452289963|5.0|I will start this review by stating a simple fact:     This book has changed my life and will continue to change it until I die.     I am aware now and for me, that is enough. Being aware is the plain and simple truth behind my continuing transformation. However, as plain and simple as the truth is, it isn't easy. It is a constant challenge to be aware of my thoughts, but I have found that Eckhart was right about the egoic thoughts evaporating once I shine a light on them. That doesn't mean they don't come back or that new ones don't form, because they do. And sometimes they slip past me unnoticed for several minutes until I become aware of them again, but over time I have found that it gets easier to recognize egoic thoughts for what they are and they occur fewer and farther between now. They also evaporate much faster than before. It's like seeing them for what they are just takes all the fight out of them.     I am not quite sure I fully understand what everybody means by spiritual awakening and I never sought that. All I wanted was a way out of fear-based behavior and I have found it in this book. That is why this book is now, and will forever remain, the single most important self help book in my library. If you read this book and understand it, you will know how it helps to live without fear.     I didn't come to Amazon to read reviews for a book I already have and love. I came to Amazon to see about ordering The Power of Now. When I saw some of the single stars for A New Earth, I decided to read those reviews to see why somebody wouldn't love the book as much as I did and was surprised by what I read.     I have read in some reviews that the author is just repeating Buddha's teachings and claiming them as his own. For myself, I never felt the author claimed these ideas as his own. In fact, he repeats many teachings of Jesus and Buddha throughout the book and lists them as such. I also can't recall him ever claiming himself as enlightened. In fact, the one thing I do remember about any personal claims he made was that working on the ego was an ongoing process for him.     And just to prove a point, and I might just be proving it to myself, when I read those reviews I got angry. I felt threatened and insulted for loving the book so much when there were other people out there who didn't like it at all. I made the assumption that they were all still in the grip of the ego and thought how unconscious they all were. Then I became aware of my thoughts, all angry and superior in nature, and they evaporated.     For the first time since I was a very young child, I am free. Not completely. Not yet. That might never happen, but I experience true freedom throughout my day, day after day, and for me, mere words will never be adequate enough to express my gratitude to Eckhart Tolle for sharing this wisdom with me.
B000002AH7|5.0|It is rare that I buy a cd. I usually steal them off the internet. But Miles davis is the exception. I will ALWAYS buy his music due to the quality of talent. I love this cd so much. Track 1 is my favorite track of the entire cd. I am so lucky to have been able to get this cd.
B0002STNQ2|3.0|I'm a fairly new Michael Chrichton reader, so I'm not familiar with his earlier classics such as \\"The Andromedia Strain\\".  I didn't go in expecting much when I began to read \\"Prey\\" and I don't think I got to much out of it either.  The storyline is great, the fear provoked by those miniscule self-evolving technical monsters is something I think Stephen King would admire, but the reason why I couldn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would is due to the fact that his character development is TERRIBLE.  This is the second Michael Chrichton book I read where I care nothing for the characters.  I liked the main character enough, Jack, but everyone else seemed like a cardboard cut out.  And the way he was easily able to get over his wife's sudden change into some techno-zombie is unbelievable.
B00180R06I|5.0|For anyone interested on the history of horror, this film is a must.  Carl Dreyer has a unique style of storytelling and filming that stands apart from all other filmmakers. I have other transfers of this film, but the Criterion version is the best.  A viewer will notice some spots and blotches left on the film.  Criterion does not clean it up completely.   From reading the write-ups of previous Criterion transfers I own, I gather the reason they do this is to preserve the version in a state that would be very similar to how it would have looked in the theatres when it was released.  They would not have been pristine.  The technology was not advanced enough and, in this case, a viewer in the early 30s would have noticed some spots and blotches still left on the film.   I hope this write-up was helpful and I hope you enjoy this film as much as I do.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|Alright so people aren't happy with a new Slipknot sound. Let's be real, who wants a band to play the same stuff they did on the last album? Nothing is going to live up to MFKR or the self titled because at the time they were just amazing for hard rock then. It's time to do something different and evolve as a band which is what they did on Subliminal Verses and the same on here. We know these band memebers from other projects now (Stone Sour, Murderdolls) and those influences are going to come into play here as well. I think overall this is a great album and is still hard and loud and fast as well as showing a softer side of Slipknot. I'm glad that they can show they can be musical and play instead of just noise and screaming. Corey singing through hooks is something new that we just saw on the last album. I love Slipknot, I have been a huge fan since MKFR and I will continue to remain a fan of this band no matter what they put out. If you can't respect a band changing their sound and doing something different, you shouldn't listen to music anymore.

This cd replaces the vinyl album I had way back when. I was reminded how great STYX is when I recently attended one of their concerts with the band BOSTON. They can still rock!
B000002J6F|5.0|Best album ever. In this re-mastering, the segue between songs on the first side is lost. Sounds much better than my 35 year old vinyl.

B0017U7PT6|1.0|I only bought this movie because I didn't get to see it in theaters and thought it would be nice to see on Blu-Ray.  Like most people, I thought this thing was so boring.  The mish-mash of Native American grammar (white rain) and Klingon hunting rituals made this movie just dumb.  Manny the Mammoth from Ice Age looked better than the mammoths in this movie.  But that didn't ruin Blu-Ray for me.  It was early on in the scene where the main character is telling the girl with the blue eyes about Venus.  They lost me as soon as I saw that they didn't bother to clean up her eyes in post-production.  You don't even have to strain to see the contact lenses she's wearing.  He's wearing them too.  Lost me...that's it.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|My husband love it so much we order a 2nd for a friend for his birthday
B000O75F7C|5.0|I've been a Porcupine Tree fan for a few years now, and generally like all of their work quite a bit, and yet when \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" was released, initially it did not sit well with me, even after seeing the band play the entire thing live in concert, mostly because of its incredibly blunt, unabashedly preachy and possibly overdone message about the disconnection and apathy in today's youth.  It's a concept album that creates its own, incredibly bleak world that somehow manages to sink even lower into hopelessness than the other consistently melancholy and bleak Porcupine Tree records.<br /><br />We've heard it all before by now, right?  Claims by the older generation that the teenagers of today are more wild and out of control than ever they were during the years of their childhood, etc, etc.  Yet Steven Wilson avoids falling into this cliche by making some tangible, legitimate points.  Has the over-prescription of medication corrupted and numbed today's youth and robbed them of much of their feeling and ambition?  Has the drastic increase of electronic media kept kids from valuable social experiences?<br /><br />While I've always refused to take medication, the answer to the latter question is in my case a resounding yes.  As a 19 year old who has seen these things in many friends and acquaintances, I would say this album hit home hard for me, and reluctance to acknowledge the truth of some of the points made here may have been what caused my less than favorable reaction to it.  I discuss the message and concept in such detail because I feel it is so interwoven into the fabric of the album that if you don't appreciate it, it might be hard to enjoy the music.<br /><br />As far as the actual music, it's classic Porcupine Tree, although it seems the beautiful vocal harmonies have been toned down a bit.  Those looking for the trademark world-weariness and rainy, spacious airy beauty that characterized every previous PT record will find it here.  The production's a bit muddier than usual, but still quite good.<br /><br />The songwriting, while great, is not something particularly new for Steven Wilson (the powerfully executed concept makes up for this minor flaw) except on the 17 minute epic, \\"Anesthetize\\", which I feel any fan would agree is one of their best songs ever, and not just because of the solo from Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson.  The hypnotic ending segment is likely my favorite thing on the whole album.  \\"Water so warm that day / I counted out the waves / As they broke into surf / I smiled into the sun\\", Steven sings, relaxed, in the only remotely hopeful moment on the whole album.<br /><br />\\"My Ashes\\" is a brilliant ballad that ranks among such classics \\"Heart Attack in a Lay By\\" and \\"Waiting Phase One\\". The closer, \\"Sleep Together\\" is the ultimate declaration of hopelessness on the album, as the lyrics are a proposal of mutual suicide from a teenager to their lover.  \\"Sentimental\\" has a brilliantly placed and emotional reprise of \\"Trains\\" from In Absentia at its end, which gives Porcupine Tree's career a coherence and conceptual continuity which I greatly appreciate.<br /><br />I'm waffling back and forth on the issue of whether the \\"Nil Recurring\\" EP tracks (they're from the same sessions and fit the concept) should have been included as many say, but in any case this album flows incredibly well and is fairly complete the way it is.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" is a fantastic and powerful conceptual statement that may be too preachy and blunt for some, but does what it's attempting to do incredibly well.  Highly recommended for anyone and everyone, but if this is going to be your first Porcupine Tree record, you should realize this isn't Wilson's usual lyrical style.al, but still quite good.

B0000C9V3T|4.0|Tarantino always knows how to put a great soundtrack together for his movies and this one is no exception. He consistently introduces the listener to great music that they may have not heard otherwise. Although extremely ecclectic, just about every song seems to compliment each other instead of clashing. The only downside of this particular collection is the out-of-place contribution by The RZA with his silly \\"Ode to Oren Ishii.\\" If it wasn't for this single track, then the CD would deserve 5 stars.
B000YENUI6|3.0|I liked this movie but... I thought it was very interesting and action movie. when the movie ended I looked at my kids and said. Is that it? I don't recomend it for children under 13. it's mostly for adults. There's nudity and violence. Some secenes toward the end it made my oldest son turn his head.And he's 22.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|It was only a matter of time before the reviews for this album started flooding in, stating that the songs sound like this or that, comparing them to a certain other band which will go un-named, and just generally ranting that it's not Iowa Part 2..well to anyone who doesn't like this album and renounces their Slipknot obsession..F**K YOU! Because only the true Slipknot maggots will appreciate what exactly went into this album, and exactly what you'll get out of it!  Slipknot have basically taken everything about what they've done previously and sliced, hammered, pounded, beaten, gutted and mutated it all into an hour's worth of smoldering, bleak, aggressive yet alarmingly catchy music!  I just want to scream the chorus of \\"Vendetta\\" into the face of a random  on the train, I want to blast \\"Gematria\\" so loud from my car that people will think it's Judgement Day, it's THAT good!  The songs jump right off the disc into your brain and pound you with that unmistakable medicine that has saved oh-so many lives in the past, and to write this album off without letting it soak into your black soul is a crime worthy of suicide!  Seriously...because you're missing out on a record that we should all thank the devil for, and that my friends, is brutal, and that..my friends, is METAL!   Bring on the LP Version, I wanna hear every high and low from this spawn on sexy black vinyl!
B000000OAC|4.0|Looking back at the 1970s, sometimes many forget how big the band Queen was. Even as Queen moved into the 1980s, while their popularity did slightly decline in the United States, it continued to be very high in Europe. Their performance at Live Aid is widely considered one of the greatest of all-time and their subsequent \\"Magic\\" tour is considered one of the all-time greatest concert tours. If it weren't for Freddie Mercury's death in 1992, we might still be talking about Queen being as big a band as the Beatles. When Queen released their 1973 self-titled debut album, it showed all of the signs of greatness to come. This album would show how the band embraced a \\"theatrical\\" feel to their music as well as embrace a sound that would evolve into what would become Heavy Metal.   Queen's next four albums would move more toward the theatrical sound and to some extent move away from that Heavy Metal sound (although there would be some highlights through these albums).   They would also expand their horizons such as incorporating such sounds like ragtime.   Also during this time Queen would establish themselves as a major force in the music business, but it would be their sixth album \\"News of the World\\" that would cement their standing as a commercial and creative force in the music business.  At the same time, Queen would continue to innovate and explore more new horizons.  Much of the popularity of this album would be on the songs \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We are the Champions\\", but this collection offers so much more.    Queen is an example of the sum of the parts actually being greater than the whole. However, if you take each of the four members of Queen, they easily stand on their own as a top musician in their profession. Freddie Mercury is easily known to be the emotional and flamboyant lead vocalist of Queen who indeed has a legendary voice. Brian May is the legendary lead guitarist and probably the second most popular member of the band. Roger Taylor and John Deacongo extremely underrated. Listen to Taylor's thundering drumming in the studio or live and one can easily understand why he was asked to participate in an All Star Drum Jam (The S.O.S. All-Stars) at the Live Earth concert. As for John Deacon, he might be one of music's all-time underrated bass players. Many of his bass lines have proven to be the foundation for Queen's musical sound. In addition to being top musicians, all four members play integral roles in the songwriting.      On \\"News of the World\\", Queen goes for more of a \\"stripped down\\" Rock sound.   Here are the highlights from each of the tracks.    \\"We Will Rock You\\":  This is a well-known and legendary track by Queen.  This song sets the tone for the \\"stripped down\\" sound of this collection.  Everyone knows about the background clapping behind Mercury's a cappella-like vocals.  However May's guitar work toward the end of this song is often overlooked.    \\"We are the Champions\\":  Obviously this is the other well-known song.  There isn't much I can add to what many already know.  I always saw this song as a cross of Arena Rock meeting Theatrical Rock - great stuff.    \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\": This song features Mercury and Taylor on lead vocals.  This song has a raw feel to it.  There are lots of guitars and a blistering tempo to the song that almost could put it into a punk category.    \\"All Dead, All Dead\\": For the most part, this is a piano ballad.  May takes the lead vocals and Mercury takes the background vocals.  There is a psychedelic sounding bridge midway through the track.   To some extent there is a theatrical  feel to this song - especially on the chorus.    \\"Spread Your Wings\\":  This song is highlighted by great guitar and piano work.  This song is sung as a narrative about someone named Sammy who works as a janitor at a Rock bar.  Deacon is the songwriter on this one and does a great job at painting a visual in this narrative story.  This is a rare Queen song without backing vocals or harmonies.\\"Fight From the Inside\\": This song features Taylor on lead vocals. As always, Taylor doesn't disappoint on the lead vocals.   Also stripped down, this song has more of a slant on the percussion and bass than most Queen tracks.  Taylor's higher octaves (compared to Mercury) as perfect for this track.    \\"Get Down, Make Love\\":  This might be one of Queen's more \\"risqué\\"  songs.  It has a psychedelic feel to it.   This might be one of Queen's strongest tracks because each of the four members of Queen get to showcase their musical talents at one point or another in the song: Mercury (Vocals, Piano); May (Guitars); Deacon (Bass); Taylor (Drums).  Deacon's bass especially shines.  This song shows why each member of Queen is at the top of their profession.    \\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\":  This song has a classic Blues feel.  With May on lead vocals, he too proves how good a lead vocalist he is as he flawlessly pulls of the Blues sound.    \\"Who Needs You\\": Great Spanish sounding acoustic guitars are the highlight of this track.  The maracas help add to the Spanish feel.    \\"It's Late\\":  This song also has a stripped down Rock feel to it.  This song to some extent also has a theatrical feel to it - especially on the chorus.    \\"Melancholy Blues\\":  This song has a stripped down sound, but that is because there are no guitars on this song.  Piano and bass are prominently featured on this one.  This song has a \\"supper club\\" feel to it.    Like many Queen albums, this album did require a few listens by me in order to get into it.  There definitely is more to offer than the well-known songs of \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We are the Champions\\".  Highly recommended
B0000035E7|5.0|Nirvana was one of my first favorite bands!!  I used to have this album (bleach) and someone \\"borrowed\\" and never returned it.  I had to replace it!  Bleach is a lot different from the sound of their other albums, and it's their first.  a must have for nirvana fans!
0143034901|5.0|\\"There are worse prisons than words\\"<br /><br />This book has been on my Amazon recommended list for some time but I never got around to reading it.  A co worker of mine had it sitting in his drawer so I figured I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />I read it in two days, reading till my eyes hurt.<br /><br />It's difficult to classify this book. Historical fiction? Mystery? Suspence? All that and more.<br /><br />The book takes place in Spain, in the mid 1900's.  A young boy, who's father owns a book shop takes him to a place of lost books. Daniel picks out a book to keep as his own and is so captivated, he reads it in a single night never putting it down.  He's captivated by the world the author has created.  It's not until he starts to track down more works by the mysterious author that the real story begins.<br /><br />Over the course of Daniel's search (the main story is told over the course of a decade or so) for the mysterious author Julian Carax, he uncovers a tragic tale of love, loss, betrayal and revenge.  In addition, the further he digs into this pit of mystery, the more he notices parallells between his own life's path and that of the very man he's seeking.<br /><br />In a way, this book reminds me of The Historian (if you haven't read it, you should stop reading my review now and get yourself  a copy..it's THAT good) in that much of the story is revealed by way of the past.  In the historian it's primarily letters discovered by the protagonist whereas in this book, it's personal accounts; memories.<br /><br />The unique hook of this book is that it's a book about a LOVE of books in a way.  The main character has a love of literature, he works in a bookstore his father owns, and the mystery starts off with a book that's gone forgotten by the world.  This makes him instantly identifiable to any would be readers because if we didn't love to read, we wouldn't be reading this book in the first place, right?<br /><br />Twists and turns abound, and the characters are a joy to read, especially a special friend whom Daniel meets during the course of the story.  I won't spoil it but this friend of Daniel's is absolutely hysterical, without even trying to be which makes it all the funnier.<br /><br />Zafron is a superb writer, detailing the events and locations in the book with flair and descriptiveness without being tedious.<br /><br />This book is utterly fantastic.  And any fan of literature, no matter what genre, should give it a shot.  Don't let it sit in your Amazon recommendations list for months like I did!during the course of the story.

B000003TAR|5.0|I first fell in love with Nirvana when I listened to In Utero, and Nevermind on cassette in my room.  There are a lot of awesome songs on this album, i like the lyrics and i like the sound!  and i just love nirvana, and always will.
015206396X|5.0|I know this is considered a \\"teen\\" book but I am far from a teen and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is set in a fantasy world, but no magic or elves.  It is a very original world in which some people are born with a \\"grace.\\"  These people are exceptionally gifted in some particular area and their eyes are different colors which identifies them as graced.<br /><br />Some graces are useless, others are interesting and still others are so helpful that these people are put into service for the King.<br /><br />The book follows the story of a young girl (Katsa) who is graced with fighting and killing - or so it seems - and a young Prince named Po who is graced with fighting.  They are pitted against an evil King whose grace is so powerful that they aren't sure they can combat him even if they work together as a team.<br /><br />The only real flaw in the book for me was the reach and power of the evil King's grace.  It was so powerful that I didn't think the author could reasonably work out a solution, but in the end I was happy with it.  I was worried that it was going to fall short, but in the end it wrapped up nicely (but not neatly, which I consider another plus to the book.)<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of Fantasy, this is well worth the read.<br /><br />The only real disappointment was find out that this was the author's first work.  I had hoped to find a stack of previous books from Cashore to begin reading.  Instead I have to wait for her to write another one.  Get to work!<br /><br />:-)

Breaking Dawn completed the series very well wrapping up the story for everyone but left me wanting more of these characters.  I have read the series twice and will continue reading them until the movie and guide book come out in November and December.  I can't wait for Midnight Sun.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|This version of Persuasion follows Jane Austen's story and dialogue closely.  Two sweethearts parted 8 years ago unexpectedly cross paths again.  Ann has pined for Captain Wentworth, but he has hardened his heart against her. How will they find their happy ending?  The answer is subtle, so think England, not Hollywood.  A very beautiful and enjoyable love story.

0060557818|4.0|All London office worker Richard Mayhew tried to do that evening was help a damsel in distress, but he got more - way more - than he bargained for. Neil Gaiman has spun another magical mystery tour from the elements of the mythological quest paradigm. Underworlds, eternity, horrific beasts to be slain, labyrinths, immortality, heroes and antiheroes - it's all here in modern form, but nothing crucial really changes, does it? Reading this book is like watching a movie in your head. And through it all, the hapless Richard discovers a well of personal courage that he never thought existed. A timeless tale of humanity's existential search told anew, skillfully written and highly recommended. It's a trip!
B00168HARG|5.0|I must say I didn't expect too much at first. What is there to tell that hasn't been said before in the movies? And how do you create more than a couple of episodes about a mom trying to protect her son from human-like robots?  Man, was I wrong.  Of course there are Terminators all over the place and they are constantly being destroyed and get back up and what not again and again but that's what the story is about.     In short, for those who don't know: Sarah and her son want to destroy the computer network Skynet to avoid a future Armageddon. They get help from a sexy fem-bot: Cameron Phillips.   The trio is being chased by the FBI who doesn't know that the Connors are the good guys and by the machines whose existence is at stake.    It's fun to watch (if you keep in mind that most of the shot people are in fact robots...)   Lena Headey does a terrific job as Sarah. She is convincing as a caring mother, but she also manages the action very well and even looks convincing when others think she's insane. (Sorry fans, but I didn't think Linda Hamilton ever pulled that off. She looked insane all right but for the rest ...)  Summer Glau as the protective Terminator is funny. The way she moves and reacts to emotional (and other) outbreaks always make me laugh.   Some SciFi critics think Thomas Dekker too old for his role as John but I never had a problem with that. He is a terrific actor in his own right (as he already showed us in Heroes) and fits perfectly in the story.  Richard T. Jones is very good as the FBI agent who senses there is much more behind all this.    If you don't take this all too seriously (who does?) you're in for a ride.  Of course I would have wanted more episodes in this season but because of the writers strike there are none. Well, less is more. Better this way than having a few more but written by amateurs.  Blu-ray is state of the art. Also the extras are nice to watch. Of course there's a making of with interviews of the producers and writers etc. but what I really liked were the audition tapes of all the leading actors and the dance practice of Summer Glau.
0061564893|4.0|Easy, fascinating read. Well researched and presented in a balanced way that allows you to follow the authors' thinking and discoveries. The book exposes the fallacies of conventional western teaching of history and Europe `discovering' the world.
031606792X|5.0|Awesome book! Awesome series! I am a Stephenie Meyer fan - she is a gifted author and storyteller. Breaking Dawn exceeded my expectations. I cannot understand what all the flack is about. I'm sad the the series is over and hope that The Host will be a series???

B000A0GYD2|5.0|As a huge fan of the space program and with an extensive collection of DVD's and books about the Apollo missions, I have learned more from this DVD collection than most other shows about the Apollo project.    The most fascinating aspect is what happened behind the scenes that hasn't been shown before. Every episode revealed secrets from the missions that I, and one would assume most people would not be aware of.  The show is brilliantly acted out and the special effects are awesome.  The scenes on the moon make you look twice at just how authentic they have made it.    This collection has been remastered in widescreen and the digital sound is fantastic.     Even if you're not a space fan I would highly recommend this DVD box set, even if it's just for the history lesson. I have always been in awe of all space pioneers, even more so after watching this collection.

And as for the recent sequel (Lost Boys, The Tribe), all I can I say is \\"Cry Little Sister.\\"
1400063515|4.0|This book is good. Maybe I don't even understand how good it is. The way Taleb is writing gets to your ego; he feels so cocky. But, yes, man has a point.

Taleb has interesting view point to life; don't try to predict it, or forecast it, life will fool you anyway, sucker!  Don't believe in your most valued economic forecasters, they don't know much, unfortunate... for them. Expose your self to \\"black swans\\", positive ones hopefully, try to make negative black swans to be gray swans for you, if it is grey one you have prepared yourself well for future. These swans are rare events in life, which take place even we would not like them to happen. Even one event can make a difference, and most likely a shocking difference.
B000PC1N54|3.0|This La Scala production was promoted as the \\"new\\" version of the great 1989 Emmy-winning \\"Aida\\" from The Met. The La Scala production has much to recommend it: fine singing from Violeta Urmana as Aida and Ildiko Komlosi as Amneris; beautiful performances by the two featured dancers in the ballet (Verdi wrote great ballet music here); lively and nuanced conducting by Ricardo Chailly; and the full-bodied, spirited sound of the La Scala chorus. These are the five-star features of the production.<br /><br />But I've just spent (too much) time watching the Beijing Olympics and so, with gymnastics and diving judges as my new role models, it's time to start taking deductions. Roberto Alagna never looks comfortable as Radames. At first, I thought he was just physically uncomfortable in his armor-laden costume. But, in the end, he's really a lyric tenor and this role shouldn't be in his repertoire. The only time he truly shines is in the Tomb Scene where his lyricism can soar; that's a long time for the viewer to wait for a performer to show his stuff! This must have been filmed on opening night because it was during the second performance that Alagna walked off stage minutes into the opera, after being booed at the end of \\"Celeste Aida\\" (which he sings poorly here too - hitting several sour notes). His untimely exit is well-documented on You-Tube wherein Ildiko Komlosi, in her regal Egyptian costume, walks onto an empty stage, looks confused but is soon joined by a guy in jeans and a leather jacket (Alagna's understudy) who walks out and immediately starts singing to her.<br /><br />\\"Aida\\" is Grand Opera but only works if the spectacle shares equal billing with the intimate, tragic tale it tells of forbidden love. This production falls short here too because, as good as the singing of the two principal women is, their acting is too wooden. With the exception of Urmana's moving rendition of \\"O patria mia,\\" none of the leads ever become flesh and blood characters to me.<br /><br />The stage does indeed have the look of a spectacle. It is filled with ancient Egyptian looking statues and decorations, but I thought they looked cheap, not elegant. If you want to see beautiful sets in an \\"Aida\\" production, get the DVD of the 2003 Gran Teatre del Liceu of Barcelona production that features trompe-d'oeil sets painted on paper by Josep Mestres Cabanes for a production of \\"Aida\\" in 1945. Almost 60 years later, the sets were restored for the production. Seeing these paintings as sets is like being at a Catalonian art exhibit.<br /><br />Finally, as other reviewers have pointed out, the filming in this La Scala production is poorly conceived. I don't mind if the video director takes creative liberties and doesn't just point the camera at the stage. But here, Patrizia Carmine gets creative at all the wrong times. So, right in the middle of an aria, suddenly the face of the singer may be completely obscured by out-of-focus flowing cloth. Or, even worse, in the middle of a duet or a trio when you need to see the players interacting with each other, statues or other stage decorations may suddenly be superimposed right over their faces. It's extremely irritating not to be able to see the players at these crucial moments in the drama.<br /><br />Bottom line, I would recommend this \\"Aida\\" only for collectors or if the \\"five-star\\" elements I listed in the first paragraph appeal to you more than the \\"deductions\\" I've taken in the rest of the review.deed have the look of a spectacle.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Honestly, I thought A Rush Of Blood To The Head was their best stuff, but I'm not even sure anymore. This CD is like no other Coldplay CD before it, and with that said I think that it takes them to a new level.    It contemplates love and death, has an intro and a conclusion, and BEAUTIFULY written songs.    By far one of their best albums to date, blowing away X&Y. Anyone who doesn't realize that needs to actually sit down and listen to the amazingness of Viva La Vida!
B000006OBQ|5.0|It is an amazing document of Sinatra in his environment. The sound quality is superior. It is a hall of fame arrangement and performance by Quincy Jones and the Count Basie Orchestra.

B001BKXUOQ|5.0|When the 3rd installment was made,every non-loyal maggot struck out in protest \\"oh it suck's,it's not Slipknot anymore\\",perhaps' they lost their vision on the master's behind the mask's. Change is a necessary cause in the music industry,for one,no one want's to here the same crap over and over,especially if it's the same band,or unless it's the same cd. An example of consistent change in sound would be another favorite of mine;KoRn. Yet no one exclaim's,no one lash's out in protest,when KoRn started out very heavy,well,for their style of music.Sure,their stuff is lighter now,but,it's more mature.     Same case with Slipknot,in case anyone missed the review for 3rd album,they mentioned,they viewed the world differently than when they first started,not as angry. This album is fantastic,all element's are applied,except for country,ew. Some acoustic,metal(obviously),rock,all the good stuff. I wouldn't say there's a low point on this album,unless there's a large amount of non-loyal Slipknot fan's out there who just want a head banger's ball of an album. I recommend this album for true fan's only,if you aren't one,then buy a few more copy's of Iowa or the self-titled.
031606792X|5.0|All the negative reviews at the beginning are ridiculous. This is a fantastic book that wraps up an amazing story line, Thank you for not dragging it into a sequel after sequel soap opera. This started with a bang (Twilight) and ended wonderfully. Those whining critics wanted to see a soap opera of the Bella, Edward, Jacob triangle.     Read it you'll enjoy it, but you have to read the first 3 books first!
0307386171|4.0|Some reviewers are complaining that this is really just a short story.  Uhhhhh, ok, maybe, but the author has packed it full of emotion and feelings that make it a page turner.  Who hasn't said the wrong thing at the wrong time and regretted it later, sometimes much later?  Or who hasn't stood by and done nothing to save a relationship out of pride or fear of rejection?  And who hasn't wondered decades later about the paths not taken?  Most of us can relate to at least some of the feelings that Ian McEwan so masterfully depicts.<br />If it's a \\"short story,\\" it's definitely the best short story I've read in many years.
0887307280|5.0|No doubt one of the most important books any entrepreneur or business owner should read. I thought it was so good, that in addition to this book, I ended up reading one of his other books (Emyth Mastery) as well as buying his tape programs from Nightingale Conant.    The basic premise is that most entrepreneurs work in their businesses rather than on their businesses. That is developing the systems, processes and strategies that allow other people to do the work. He then goes on to explain what entrepreneurs should be working on (the business development process.)    Whilst probably not a unique insight (successful business owners have always done this,) he does bring it into focus and provides a program to follow and a mindset to adopt. [...]

0553582038|4.0|After the headlong excitement of bloodshed, intrigue, and snappy dialogue that we had in the first three books of the 'Song of Ice and Fire', 'A Feast for Crows' is quite a change. The plot slows down considerably, and not a lot seems to happen between the beginning and the end. This does not, however, ruin the book: on the contrary, though it is certainly the weakest link in the series so far, 'Feast' stands quite well on its own merits.    For one thing, Martin's writing continues to be a pleasure to read. The dialogue is as snappy as ever and some chapters's climaxes had me on the edge of my seat, despite this volume's overall leisurely pacing. Which brings me to my next point: despite the complaints of those who were expecting another action-packed thriller from Martin's pen, I found the slow pace of 'Feast' not so much a fault as a ... well, a simple change of pace. After all, since Book 3 wrapped up the big old war, it just makes internal sense for not as much to be going on. Instead, in 'Feast for Crows' we are given a much deeper and fascinating look at the world that Martin has built this series around: and good heavens!, it is a rich one. This man has some incredible ideas, and puts them together with a deft instinct for unity and verisimilitude. Despite being a bridge book to fill the gap between Beginning and End, 'Feast for Crows' ably holds its own.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|This little flash does everything I need.  It is compact, light weight and it works great.    While I can bounce it off of the ceiling for indoor use, you can't turn it side to side, so for vertical shots you can't bounce it.  It is one con I can surely deal with though.    Unless you're a pro, I'd say this is all you would need in a flash, save your money on more expensive ones.
B00188KD1Y|1.0|Judging from the reviews here, I've come to two decisions.  The first is that we must have seen a different movie.  The second is that...this review probably isn't going to popular.  Neither of which I can really do anything to solve, so here we go...    Death Race can't qualify as anything other than a guilty pleasure.  And Paul W.S. Anderson is the go-to guy for that kind of flick, what with his constantly panned movies that include AVP, Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, etc.  His movies are also consistenly deemed \\"like watching a video game,\\" a critique I've never really took seriously, being an avid gamer myself.  But Death Race is like watching a video game...except it's one that's not thrilling, not interactive and just plain dumb.    Billed as a being based on the 1970s Grindhouse flick Death Race 2000, this version is all about a \\"not-too-far-in-the-future\\" future state of America, where the economy has collapsed and mega-corporations own everything, including the prisons.  And of course, since we all know that corporations want to make money, Death Race, a TV show that's pulled from our apparent desire to watch other people and the olden gladiator/chariot races, is born.  Pitting inmates against each other with the gleam of being released if they win enough, Death Race sounds, if not promising then at least interesting on paper.  But it's the execution that kills.    Paper thin characters I can forgive.  A lame plot with even lamer \\"twists\\" that everyone knows are coming either intuitively or by watching the trailers, is also forgivable.  I can even almost forgive the portrayal of females being either frigid ice queens or sexually-charged navigators whose only real purpose is to look \\"hawt.\\"  I mean, when we're talking about a guilty pleasure aimed at young men, it's to be expected.  But when the flick isn't even entertaining in the least, then, NASA, we have a problem.    With the \\"race\\" consisting of stages (*ahemvideogames*) and even a boss battle tossed induring the second race, Death Race feels like a lame version of Twisted Metal, minus the cool characters, the exciting matches and, well, the fun factor.  In the end, Death Race had me looking at my watch, waiting for something to happen...and then something did happen: the credits rolled.  And I wished I had gone to see Tropic Thunder again.

B00005JPNY|4.0|I never heard of the books but then as far as i knew young Mr. Potter was all the rage. I had to give this film a pass when it first came out even though I wanted to see it. Life got in the way and many moons later I finally viewed the film on DVD, a rental to boot.  I have to say, I'm not sure why this film has so many mixed reviews when I, my wife and college age daughters all loved it.  Why? Because we did. We found the characters to be both complex and sympathetic. The story is very intriquing and well paced. I'm glad it was rated PG13 because it had a few rough spots (the polar bear warriors fighting was particularly savage). As I don't own this film (a problem I'll rectify soon) I have to forego with explicit descriptions and character's names since it has been a few weeks since we viewed the film. Despite that it left its mark on me. The young lady (Lyra?) was a treat. She was payed with just the right amount of precociousness and innocence as well as drive to make her the perfect foil for adults who disregard youth as simply precocious and naive. Her rescues, escapes and minor triumphs are all worthy of acclaim. Her friends (rescuers and defenders) may have their agendas but they also sincerely help her. The polar bear warrior king was (voiced by Ian McKellen) was perfect as her loyal protector with a history that needed to be resolved.  I've read the complaints about this film and was prepared for the worst. It's too bad their noise prevailed in making this film so unpopular.  Now, thanks to that rabble, I'll have to read the books to get to the finish of the tale. That's not so terrible but this franchise deserved better than it received at the box office. I'm sure the nay-sayers are delighted in their results.  As for the complaints that this film (and the books?) impugned \\"mother church\\", well, I saw no such evidence to validate those claims.   No surprise there.
0321544080|5.0|This book has a very simple layout, a picture on the right side and a description of the shot on the left.  While it doesn't provide a high level of detail, it does demonstrate the wide range of challenges the author faced getting the pictures completed.  Sometimes the challenges are technical, sometimes it is working with models and sometimes he is just lucky.  It is not a step by step lighting book, but it is an excellent resource for seeing how an expert dealt with all types of problems to get an excellent image.
B0000029DD|5.0|If you've got a thing for music then you should enjoy this. You can feel Buckley's emotion and soul come through in the recording. You can hear the imperfections and feel how real it is. Beautiful lyrics along with his voice take you away. If you listen to music and truly enjoy doing so, then you will not be disappointed.    Most people will probably buy this album for Jeff Buckley's cover of Hallelujah. That's a perfectly legitimate reason as he definitely recorded the definitive version. However once you start listening to the other tracks, you realize you just hit the jackpot. \\"Lilac Wine,\\" \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over,\\" and \\"So Real\\" are great ones to start off with. His death was tragic, but his legend will live on with his music.
B000YW8S26|3.0|In French-Belgian film \\"Odette Toulemonde,\\" Catherine Frot is Odette an ordinary woman, a mother of two children, working at a department store. She loves more than anything reading books by bestselling novelist Balthazar Balsan (Albert Dupontel).    But Balthazar is not a happy man; his recent book is ridiculed and treated as a trash by a sneering critic on TV, who, Balthazar knows soon, is having an affair with his wife! Heartbroken Balthazar finds consolation in a most unexpected place, however: a letter from Odette, most devoted fan of the writer, which leads him to her and a new life.    \\"Odette Toulemonde\\" is helmed by first-time director Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, dramatist and novelist, best known for his \\"Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran,\\" which was made a critically acclaimed film starring Omar Sharif. Schmitt as a film director has successfully created several moments that are surreal and charming at the same time (when she is happy, Odette literally floats in the air), but the film's charms are whimsical and look sometimes misplaced such as musical sequence in the kitchen.     Film's soundtrack includes Josephine Baker songs, which are great, but while the reference to the great singer tells us something about the warm personality of Odette, I really don't know if it was necessary as the film has already got Catherine Frot's fine acting. Odette is believable and her down-to-earth personality exudes warmth, thanks to talented Frot, but the director needs to flesh out supporting characters including Odette's children who have no place in the story. Some episodes are really funny - Odette's first meeting with the writer is a gem - but their relations, whether as man and woman, or writer and fan, could have been developed more to make a more involving story. The film remains light-hearted while we think there may be more serious side hidden in the behaviors of Odette, which we are not allowed to see after all the waiting.    \\"Odette Toulemonde\\" is a lighthearted romantic comedy, which deals with an interesting theme of bestselling writers and their fans. It is regrettable that the director missed the chance to fully explore the topic.
0634049011|5.0|This is an excellent overview of the guitar fretboard. Very helpful and easy to follow. I learned a lot in a short amount of time.
0446401307|3.0|I started reading The Overlook in the New York Times back in 2006. For various reasons, I stopped reading the weekly installments. Later, Connelly revised the story, making it more the novel it wanted to be rather than sixteen sections of equal word length. I read the novel and quite liked it.    In The Overlook, Harry Bosch is with a special unit of robbery homicide and he gets the call around midnight. Like many times throughout his books, Bosch is asleep in an easy chair, fully dressed, ready for a case. He gets one, a murdered man out on the overlook over Mulholland. He's breaking in a new partner, a kid half his age, and the crotchety self of Bosch comes out. That's the least of his worries as FBI Special Agent Rachel Walling, old flame and fellow adventurer of previous books (including The Narrows), shows up and pulls federal rank. Bosch doesn't like that--natch--and the case is on.    The Overlook is short, unlike nearly all of Connelly's books. That feature alone makes it a nice introduction to Bosch. He's all there, at least as I can tell from the four previous books I read. Knowing some of the detail that Connelly brings to his books, it's a nice break to have a lighter book with a straightforward plot. I can only imagine how many readers first read the story in the New York Times and proceeded to buy more Bosch books. He's a great character. He ages in real time. He gets hurt and, well, it hurts him. He's not above it all, although he thinks he is some of the times.    Connelly's writing style is, to me, of the Elmore Leonard School of Writing. Leonard, like Connelly, gets out of the way as much as possible when he writes. You actually forget that Connelly is the one writing the book. Unlike, say, Don Winslow or Ken Bruen--you read a few sentences and you know, right off the bat, who the writer is. That's cool for them. Connelly's different. You take any one paragraph out of any of his books and, chances are, you'd be hard pressed to name the writer. Thatis a great trait to have, in my opinion. It does not get in the way of the story.    Another aspect of Connelly's style that more obvious to me is what I like to call the Put-Every-Detail-In way of writing. Leonard has stated that he likes to start a scene as late as possible and get out before the scene ends. Connelly writes everything: what the characters eat, how they dress, every detail is laid out, scene by scene. I do think this is an effective way to write and I tend to be of this variety more often than not. My critique group likes to excise stuff that, upon re-reading, I see I don't need.    A word about the audio: Len Cariou is a good reader for the older Bosch. Dick Hill, the reader for a lot of the other Bosch books, is a good reader, too, but Cariou was especially effective for The Overlook. Cariou's gravelly voice gave Bosch's dialogue readings an edge to them especially when Bosch was irritated with the youth and inexperience of his new partner.    The Overlook provides a unique opportunity to learn from a professional writer in his prime. That is, if you have access to the novel as well as the original New York Times version. I have both and I read a few chapters, side by side, and made comparisons. It was fascinating. Things Connelly left out of the NYT piece (because of word count constraints) he fleshed out in the novel proper. There were passages where only one word was changed. I actually got the impression that the NYT version was a rough draft. Much like Springsteen does in his concerts, he sometimes considers the album versions of his songs to be rough drafts. If anyone wants to compare the two, go on over to the New York Times website and conduct a search for it. It's still there. Put both versions side by side, examine and study the differences, and ask yourself why Connelly made certain changes. It's a wonderful insight into the mind of a professional author and it's surely will help you become a better writer. It has for me. (excerpted from [...]
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|The album includes various styles of music.  Some of the songs are more serious while other are playful.  I absolutely love this album!
B0013D8LCW|4.0|This movie was great, I loved it. But my reason for giving it four stars is the fact that it lacked passion. Both lead actors are straight, and that came across in many of the romantic scenes. It seemed almost too buddy buddy at times. Other then that, it was great. One of the best gay love stories out there.
B001B71NOI|3.0|While Trent has let go of some angst that once made him a leader of Gen X in the 90's, he doesnt quite deliver the power in the music or programming that once made Broken or Downward Spiral legendary. While some of the songs, like \\"The Four of Us Are Dying\\" really show NIN back in full form, Discipline, the first single, stalls right out of the gate.  Demon Seed and Lights in the Sky are other highlights of this album, while Echoplex and Corona Radiata are radio friendly songs for 15 seconds at best.  NIN really broke the mold with Ghosts, then fell back into the mold.  Trent, get angry, get muddy, and save us.
0061122416|4.0|I do agree that the author can be quite redundant.  This could be due to the fact that it has been translated.  Had the original been written in English, I am sure the author would be able to spice up the diction a bit.      Even though it was simply written, it evoked such imagery; I found that I could not put the book down.  It was quite entertaining, and I thoroughly enjoyed the journey.  I have a feeling that I will read it again in a few years, and have an even better understanding of its meaning, and its reflection on my life as well.
1592533868|5.0|I had debated a long time if I should purchase another quilling book but kept coming back to this one and looking at it.  I am so glad I decided to buy the book. I feel it is excellent and directions and pictures are very clear.  I would highly recommend it to anyone whether they have been quilling for a long time or just starting out.
031606792X|5.0|I was extremely pleased with this novel. I was so eager to get it that I had like butterflies in my stomach. I've turned into a total Twilight fan and I'm too old for this stuff. I just really respect Stephanie as a writer. Here's my review: I think that Stephanie tied all of the lose ends of the story up the only way she really could have. I'm not sure why every one got so upset over the birth scene either, birth is pretty nasty business even if it's not involving a vampire child. I really liked how she made it very clear that there was a loving bond between the child and Bella and that the child loved her mother even in the womb and even as she was \\"killing her\\" (the scene that was so disturbing to many). The imprinting stuff is a little strange and it did seem a little \\"convenient\\" there at the end, but I believe she had that in mind all along to a certain extent. Remember, imprinting was written about in the other novels. I agree with those who say it is a bit much that Bella and Edward would just live happily ever after with Jacob as a son-in-law. But then again, I live in a small town. I've seen some really really weird relationships form. Anything is possible.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever. I have nothing against Wes Anderson, but come on people. This is the movie equivalent to diarrhea. Aside from the beautiful landscape, this is beyond bad. Do yourself a favor and watch ANYTHING else.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|This album is absolutly awesome! I cannot say enough good things about All Hope Is Gone, this IS Slipknot! This is IOWA Metal, this IS DIFFERENT than everything else, and it never fails me! Us Iowans tend not to do what every other band is doing. We like variation.  Anyways...I have read most of the reviews here about this album and I must say, everyone who is saying bad things about it, just might not like it. Their tastes lie with Slipknot 1999-2001, and they are just having issues adjusting to what kind of art Slipknot have to offer in 2008. You don't like it, you just don't, nothing more to it. But I assure you that if it isn't your cup of maggots at first, don't write it off at that. You need to give it time to grow on you and you will see exactly how heavy and full on Iowa meets Vol. 3 it is.   Iowa had it's slow moments to it, just not like the songs Dead Memories or Snuff, but close. Dead Memories has a bit of The Shape, Gently and Iowa in it, just executed differently. There is heavy, instrumentally & lyrically but has the more Circle type vocals to top it all off. Just like the Shape and Gently. Just because it isn't Corey screaming his vocals to shreds and the music blasting your ear drums out, doesn't mean Slipknot have gone soft. Trust me.  This album took me a couple full listens to get used to some of the new styles they threw our way. Vendetta was a track I was not too happy with vocally at first because of the Southern Metal rhythem Corey was shooting out there. But the music is still very pump your fist and mosh like an animal, simply due to the rather cliche \\"Hey, Hey, Hey\\" going through the chorus while Corey is screaming \\"Are you ready for the time of your life\\"? Now the song is among my favorites along with Snuff, Psychosocial, This Cold Black and Wherein Lies Continue.   Every song on this CD is just all out Slipknot, this probably could have happened on the self-titled and Iowa but obviously they were not at this state of mind yet. That is where Slipknot went wrong and why they are having a hard time reaching the older fan base, because they pitted themselves in a corner with the constant angry, aggressive songs and not really letting up too much from there. Let me ask you all this, would you have hated and or not liked them as much if this or Vol. 3 had been their first album? I have been a True Maggot since I was 16 and I am now 24 and I love every album they have released. I feel like they have done me no wrong nor have they ever disappointed me, I really love All Hope Is Gone.  The writing and the production are top notch here. You can really feel all the percussion with this album, no matter what song you choose, everything is easy to seperate unlike previous albums.   All in all...Slipknot are a band that when the time comes will be very missed, except by all the 'extreme\\" metal heads out there, that buy into some of the carbon copied crap coming out nowadays. At least with Slipknot, you never know what you are going to get, they keep you guessing hence the title All Hope Is Gone. It is gone for all you who think you have figured this monster out! You never will.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|The Settlers of Catan is a must have for anyone who enjoys playing board games.  Winning the game requires negotiating with other players, assessing resource supply and demand, and mapping out a plan to get those last few victory points.  Yet, players are still subject to the luck of the dice and rules that usually keep the game close until the very end.    Settlers has huge replay value.  The game board is actually a collection of tiles that change position every time you play, and there are several different strategies to winning.  Additionally, the game has many expansions, scenarios, and variants to keep things interesting.    A few things to consider before purchasing: The base game requires 3 or 4 players - no more, no less.  However, an expansion is available that allows a 5th and 6th player to join in, and a 2-player variant is available in the Traders and Barbarians expansion.  Also, the game time varies depending on the experience and \\"efficiency\\" of the players.  I've played in games that take as little as 30 minutes and as long as 2 hours.  Lastly, the rules are very detailed, yet easy to understand.  You'll need to refer to the rule book the first few times you play for those \\"unusual\\" situations.    Overall, this is truly a great game.  Since it is not owned by Mattel or Hasbro, it suffers from underexposure in the U.S.  Otherwise, you would find it on the shelves of every store that sells board games.

184195392X|3.0|Life of Pi has been widely lauded by prestigious professional reviewers, but has also garnered some impassioned criticism. Much of this criticism hinges on the idea that the book promotes irrationality; that it supports an anti-intellectual worldview of a mutable universe, ignoring the absolute existence of the world and suffering. Upon some reflection, I feel that this criticism is entirely unsupported. Certainly the main character, Pi Patel, is particularly religious (he in fact actively practices three religions). However, Pi realizes that there is no evidence of the existence of god, but chooses to believe because it makes the story of his life more personally meaningful. He consciously chooses to suspend disbelieve in order to make some sense of his suffering. In all other ways he is eminently rational; he works hard and sensibly towards his own survival, never depending on faith or prayer. The novel chronicles Pi's unlikely survival at sea following a tragic shipwreck. Ultimately Pi provides two distinct, though related, stories chronicling his time at sea, and we and Pi are left to choose which to believe. Pi's decision, and our own, mirrors our choices concerning the existence of god, although it is interestingly unclear which story correlates with which philosophical viewpoint.<br /><br /> Certainly the universe really exists, however all scientists will tell you that in a certain way in exists outside ourselves, and ultimately outside our understanding. The real world is unavoidable flavored by passing through our senses and our minds before we can attempt to perceive it. For this reason we can, in a limited way, change our reality by changing our minds, and that is the point of Pi's story.<br /><br /> That being said, Pi's story did not \\"make me believe in God\\". Although not a wild fan of religion, I have no problem with the type of conscious faith that Pi uses, not to control his fellow man or secure his immortal soul, but to tell himself a more compelling story.
B001675YQ6|5.0|This movie is perfect!  Wonderfully witty romantic comedy that constantly picks on the ridiculousness of the romantic comedy.  Both a chick flick and a great guy comedy.  And not what you'd expect from Brittany Murphy; a very welcome surprise.

0743496736|4.0|I read \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" for a book discussion book...the first by Jodi Picoult.  I found the book fascinating and gripping.  The author moved me along as she wished and I believed until the end that there would be a different scenario for the end.  I will read more of her books.  In fact, I have some already, but I will be forewarned about her different slant of writing...but I'm ready for it.  I am also from NH, and I'm happy to have her as one of my new authors.
1592289444|5.0|The long walk is one hell of an adventure. It is well written and is difficult to put down once you start to read it. I am sceptical whether it is true. Walking across the Kobi desert with no food or water is a bit difficult to believe. I think a bit more research needs to be done to vouch for the veracity of this story. Whether the book is fact or fiction it is still a very interesting story to read.
B000UR9QHQ|1.0|As a rabid horror fan,  I've never been certain why so many other horror fans go \\"ga-ga\\" over this 90 minute film of predictability.  It lacks any suspense.  Albeit,  Zombie's \\"reimagining\\" was MUCH worse.  This film is so bland and dull.  Carpenter's orchestration is the best \\"thing\\" to come out of this film.  The characters are dull and lifeless,  there is obviously NO talent involved within this film.<br /><br />I must say that the story written for \\"Friday The 13th One\\" is far superior to this jive.  I simply do not like this film.  The character is never given any light of purpose.  Horror fans are a savvy bunch,  we deserve better DEBRA HILL!
031606792X|5.0|What a fantastic end to the Twilight series.  Stephenie Myer has hit a home run again.  I could not put this book down!  The details pull you right in and your emotions run wild, right along with the characters.
B000UJCALI|5.0|This film will pull you in from the very first scene.  The cinematography rivals ANY work done today on film.  The scenic landscape in it's cold tone will set you up for a good haunt.  The desolation is practically a character in-and-of itself.  This film is an abyss.  It falls from grace to a level never reached in cinema with the charcters,  the setting,  the lighting,  the blocking and the set decoration.<br /><br />Although Nicholson's performance is superb,  it is ON point:  I think the supporting cast is far better,  that is saying so much btw.  Duvall's performance is so believable that one cannot help but be mesmerized by the on screen performance.  Danny Lloyd's performance is one of the greatest child performances ever filmed.  His affect,  not words,  bring his character into a realm of existence not seen by a young actor in Hollywood today.<br /><br />This film captures the past and future.  The foreboding feeling will come over you quick and strong.  This film is the truest of horror:  You will be frightened,  yet not head to the vomitorium.<br /><br />I'm not certain who to thank for this great film,  Kubrick or the cast and those behind the scenes.  It is NOT fair to judge this film against the novel:  The film is FAR superior.  Great job to all involved.<br /><br />Perfect films like this only come along once in a \\"blue moon\\".  If you've not seen it,  buy it!  If you own it,  watch it again.
B000002I53|3.0|I expected to love this album. I love Coltrane. But it's just not gelling. For whatever reason, the album comes across as a jam-session, and not a serious musical production. The balance is uneven and the sound is muted and cloudy. The majority of the album carries no understandable theme or idea. I know it's jazz, and it's supposed to be loose, but this is just frustrating!<br /><br />Honestly, my favorite part of the album was Tyner's piano playing. He's a genius! I'll be looking into more of him.
0061122416|5.0|After reading \\"The Alchemist\\", I gave the book to both my children.  My son has just graduated from college, and my daughter is a sophomore, and in many ways this book distilled a message I have been trying to teach them in one way or another since they were very young.  Although the setting and the story is exotic for many of us (the story is about a young Andalusian shepherd boy who leaves everything familiar to go in search of a \\"treasure\\" in Egypt) the message is universal, eternal and very simple.  That message is to live your Life consciously and thoughtfully in order to determine the path your Life should take.      My own life has been amazing. Like the young shepherd, I left everything that was familiar to me and I allowed myself to be guided by my own strong yet inexplicable feelings, signs and omens, doors that opened unexpectedly, and people I met along my path.  As a result, I met and married my Soul Mate in a country not my own, and have two children who have brought immeasurable and unspeakable joy to me.      But you have to be willing to have faith, to believe in yourself and the voice of your heart.  You even need to occasionally disregard the so-called good advice of people close to you in order to do something which at first makes no sense, something not entirely easy to do, and that is discussed in \\"The Alchemist\\" as well. For me, this book was astonishing and affirming because I immediately appreciated the Truth of it.  I felt compelled to pass it on, hoping that all my \\"teaching moments\\" could take the form of a simple parable, to be remembered and renewed, for years to come.     As others have demonstrated, this is not the book for everyone, just as there is no universal religion or view of the world.  Because it was written by a Brazilian, there are language traits, cultural perceptions and beliefs which are alien and might bring discomfort to many people who live in the United States.  But for others who really believe they are here for a purpose, this little book is nothing but encouraging.

031606792X|2.0|In an effort not to be harsh - because somehow I fell into this series and consider it one of my more embarrassing, but definitely admitted, guilty pleasures (I've always had a thing for vampires... especially sexy ones) - I'm going to attempt to be fair.    I read Twilight last May and really enjoyed it. I felt there was definite magic in the way SM created her fantasy vampire universe (in the rainiest place in the US - brilliant!) and the relationship between Edward and Bella, and although I found the writing a bit weak and a lot gushy, I found the characters and the story strong enough to pull me in. New Moon was good - not as magical as Twilight, the absence of Edward and the Cullens noticeable for me as they were a big draw to the series, but still rather strong. The werewolves were a nice addition. So, now I was sucked in and anxiously awaiting Eclipse. More magic missing... and feeling very forced. To me, Eclipse read like a filler novel.     So now Breaking Dawn has finally come out (and yes, I've been waiting just as anxiously as everyone else to see how the saga will end) and I must admit disappointment. All the magic's gone. Edward - like more of a background character through most of the book - suddenly seemed like a middle aged man rather than the forever 17-year old vampire - older and wiser, but still youthful and strong - we met in Twilight. And Bella? Well, I think it was a mistake to make her a vampire so early on... she became boring! I didn't care as much about her when she was so different.     In terms of plot... most of the big moments were seen coming a mile away. The pregnancy, the imprinting... I didn't have an issues with the sex and marriage thing, although I did find the amount of sex in the book surprising considering SM's target audience. I didn't think making her legal and married was enough to justify it all. Not a good message, but I'm really not all that concerned with it. I read much worse as a teenager and if young girls are making their decisions about sex and marriage based on this book, then we have bigger issues to deal with.    The biggest issue I had was simply that a character centered story was thrown to the wind for a plot heavy story that didn't pull me in. I mean, did we really need to spend 7 pages on the J. Jenks thing (seriously - is there an editor involved here)? And why all the build up for the Volturi for a whole lotta nothing? By the time the Volturi arrived, Breaking Dawn was reading like a much less dynamic version of X-men rather than a story from the same universe as Twilight.    And yet, can we fault an author for writing the story she wanted to tell? I don't think so. Perhaps better decisions could have been made - I personally think that BD would have read better if it had come after Twilight and much of NM and Eclipse had been condensed...but, that's me. I'm not really a Jacob fan so that tug-o-war for Bella's affections wouldn't have been all that lost on me. A few chapters would have been fine.    I did think it was cool that Edward could finally hear what Bella was thinking at the end.... But, it was bittersweet because they didn't feel like the same characters from Twilight... especially Edward. A story is a story though... and I guess this was the story.     If you've come this far and read T, NM & E - you will want to finish the saga... disappointments and all. As my sister put it: \\"the cop outs just kept coming!\\"
031606792X|5.0|My daughter couldn't wait for this book to come out and wasn't let down by it. Excellent book according to her.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|Sadly, as in many movies based on books, the book was better.  They play with the facts.  The tar and feather scene shows full frontal nudity which was completely unnecessary.  Unfortunately I didn't preview this before my children watched it with the family.     The Boston Massacre is a pivotal event in American History.  Too bad they didn't represent it accurately.  Products of public school education will be easily misled.    The cinematography is very poor.  Many of the shots are way out of frame and the camera seems to be handheld by a person with a tremor problem. I began to get seasick.  I kept wanting to change the camera frame and get a steady mount for it.    I liked the acting.  John and Abagail were as I imagined them to be when I read the book.  The costumes and scenery made me feel as though I was observing the events first hand.  This made the jittery, poorly framed scenes even more disappointing.
B0000C4LXG|4.0|Deathcrush is by far the best record Mayhem ever made, this is Black Metal the way it was supposed to be and not what the 2nd wave of Black Metal bands (and Mayhem themselves) turned it into. If you want to hear a great EP of Hellhammer / Bathory / Venom inspired evil, then grab this CD because unlike everything Mayhem has released since, this won't dissapoint.
B001ACY8D2|4.0|En Xalapa (lugar desde donde se redacta esta publicación) no ha parado de llover desde hace ya una semana, día tras día, y no solo unas gotas, sino hasta que las alcantarillas drenan en sentido retrógrado y las calles forman ríos que abordan la banqueta y las viviendas. Hoy amaneció el clima así, y durante más de una hora que pasé navegando avenidas escuché este GRAN DISCO (Claudio). Este es el quinto album de estudio de la banda Sigur Ros, provenientes de Islandia (donde los críticos dicen que solo hay hielo y Björk). Y no se si fue el clima o mi humor, pero pienso que hay que tener corazón de piedra para no ser tocado por estos sonidos; melodías parsimoniosas, coros angelicales, una guitarra eléctrica que suspira cada vez que la acaricia el arco de violoncello, y cuando no es así brilla con stacattos y letras que no entiendo lo que dicen pero que evocan muchas imagenes. Otro comentario que surgió es que es un ambiental tan épico que bien puede ser soundtrack de una película de Narnia -y si me gustan- pero lástima, el soundtrack real es de Regina Spektor.  Quieren una recomendación? Escuchen el primer track de la placa -Gobbledigook- con audífonos.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|I love this watch. This is one of the best watches you can buy at this pricepoint. The materials that make up this watch are high grade, and durable. This watch has a classic look to it, it is great as a casual watch, a watch to wear to work or for a night on the town.I highly reccomend this timepiece prior to this purchase I thought that Invictas were cheap look alike watches but my perception has been quickly changed. I think that this is a better or comparable watch in styling and finish than many of the \\"top brands\\" out their today. The only downside is that it is not an automatic.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Such an entertaining mini-series. You get so connected to the characters. There are some very sad parts (true to Gaskell style) and some amazingly funny parts. Well acted and extremely well written. Always a happy ending, which I love. :)
1591841992|5.0|The premise of the book is that any problem, idea, or presentation can be solved using pictures - hand drawn pictures. Roam argues that everyone is visual, even those who say they aren't. He gives a few frameworks to work from as you prepare to draw out maps, charts, and pictures to present your ideas. I found them very helpful and refreshing. Roam also uses pictures significantly throughout the book which are also helpful.<br /><br />In addition to Dan Roam saying that hand drawn pictures are more powerful than PowerPoint, Stephanie Palmer in her book [[ASIN:0385520433 Good in a Room: How to Sell Yourself (and Your Ideas) and Win Over Any Audience]], also argues the same thing. My experience has been that they are both right. It really is much more captivating and easier to remember when I watch people draw out ideas in front of me rather than looking at a pretty computer generated graphic.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is one of the most electrifying mini-series ever made.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are perfect in their parts.  I have watched this series at least 4 times.  If you like westerns, a gripping story and strong cast of characters this is the one you don't want to miss.
B00122PJJC|5.0|At the beginning of Prince's reign as Prince of Pop, we have albums such as this. It was here that he first insisted on breaking ground on every album, and every track. He was one of the pioneers in the 80's, of music as art, and through him and other such artists, the standards were raised.<br /><br />As with many of Prince's albums, you cannot simply listen to them as good music, but must appreciate the artistry that goes into them. This man is obscenely talented, and this album has some of the most important songs of the 20th Century.
B0017XOF5A|5.0|I am a huge Star Gate Fan and I pre-ordered this movie in Blu-Ray.  Although the film was a bit predictable in places, it was nonetheless a great film. Special effects, period accuracy were superb.  During the TV series I started to get tired of the Gould presence but in this case we see the eventual end of this bunch of snake heads.  Well worth the price and Amazon usually has them at a lower price than WalMart.
B0014I4KIK|3.0|Yes, very nice voice. Nice melodies/sound and a good quality recording. The problem in my opinion is the lyrics extremely simplistic. I have a problem with lyrics which have simplistic rhymes and speak in narrative, with no poetic or interpretive aspects.  I can enjoy the music as background if I don't listen to the words - which for me is not easy.  With better writing I think she could be huge (or at least more popular than she is)
B00005JKED|5.0|'Training Day' is a dark and gritty crime drama that tells a different side of the men in blue. Denzel Washington takes a 180 and plays one vicious and dirty cop who shows a new recruit on his first day as a special teams narcotics officer how his brand of justice works! The film is slick, well paced, full of action and has a semi-plausible storyline. It does go a little Hollywood towards the end, but it's still a very entertaining movie. The film has an small early role featuring Eva Mendes(in her birthday suit!), giving us the money shot! Nice huh? ;-b The DVD transfer is excellent and has some interesting extra material.
B000C20VPA|5.0|Very pleased with the DVD'S Amadeus, Blues Brothers& Casino orders & mailing times, So far,\\"Happy With Amazon\\".

B00005RYL2|5.0|Highlander. Where do I begin?<br />I enjoy the whole story line of being immortal and fighting other immortals, slicing their heads off with swords. There can be only one!<br />I didn't see this movie until I was like 17 which was what like 3 years ago, and this movie has no era to me, just the past and the future. Its like it was neither old or new to me, it was just a cool movie.<br />I bought it for many reasons, I like to have unique movies added to my collection. I'm very choosy with movies I like. This one won a spot on my shelf. If you like sword fighting. If you like fantasy type stuff. If you like a little bloodshed. If you like being forever young. If you like Queen. If you like men with long hair and kilts and say aye, then this movie is for you.
B00005GL0Q|5.0|Released in August, 1966, at roughly the same time the Beatles stopped touring for good, \\"Revolver\\" remains amazing in its sheer variety.  The songs are all over the map:  Paul McCartney pays tribute to Motown with the horn-driven \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\"; Ringo sings about the joys of living in a \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (later the basis for their delightful third motion picture); George Harrison expresses his Indian interests in \\"Love You To\\" (and delivers a jab to the Inland Revenue with \\"Taxman\\"); and John Lennon explores his own head with \\"She Said She Said\\" and the astonishing \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", in which his voice, filtered through a revolving Leslie speaker, is combined with backward-masking to create an eerie masterpiece, unlike anything heard from a pop group before, even the Fab Four themselves.  This new, far more complex music could not have been successfully duplicated onstage, and the group thereafter left live performing behind.  Now, the recording studio was their painter's canvas, and would remain so for the remainder of the group's existence.
B00150B2SS|5.0|Having read and enjoyed Le Carre's more recent novels I felt it was time to turn back to the older ones to help me recall why I picked up this author in the first place.  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy took me a while to get sucked in to - but once there, I could not put it down.  The writing is just so superior to many of the junk read spy novels available now - which makes for a more difficult but thoroughly more enjoyable more satisfying read.  Of course now I'm going to have to go and buy the next two in the series.
1401216676|5.0|This is definately a graphic novel worth purchasing. The art is wonderfully done, and the story leaps off of the page. Joker origins have been done before, but never as beautifully as this one. If you consider yourself a Batman fan, then this is a product that you'll want to have in your collection forever!
B00008DDRX|4.0|Incredible footage of fantastic cars.  Le Mans lives up to its reputation as the best racing movie ever.
031606792X|5.0|s. meyer has done a good job of ending the saga just as any fan would like but wouldn't have expected.  i'm looking forward to the release of the official guide in dec.  i don't get the 1 stars.  some people should really take it easy, sit back and relax and just enjoy this good book.  alright, so it's not jane austen material but geez, after a long day who needs stuff like that.  i'd much rather read something like this and unwind.  the author has a very good imagination and gives you a break from reality.  i like how she plots her story, writes her characters' lines and injects humour and whatever is the right atmosphere for her scenarios.  great job and i hope we see more of her work in the coming years. :-)
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I'm extremely happy with my purchase of Lost Season 3. Delivery was fast, I will purchase thru Amazon.com in the future!!
B0017MO10U|5.0|I thought this was a great movie...it was great seeing Jack again and Ba'al is always a treat!! Amazon got this to me fast and in perfect condition!! My ONLY complaint is I don't see how Cameron went through the gate at the end of the movie as the gate was supposed to be buried so no one could go through...other than that, I loved it!!!
B000T9OP7G|5.0|To be honest, I have no clue what people can be complaining about with this series.  IF you like Terminator, you should like this.  There's no way Arnold S. and Linda H. were going to sign on for a TV series, so we get their capable replacements instead.<br /><br />The timeline of this series is obviously after the second of the three Terminator movies.  In the second, the viewer is essentially left with all Terminator entities being destroyed, and Sarah Connor protecting her 10-year old son while preparing him for his destiny. Leaving Cyberdyne Systems in ruins, they enlist the help of Miles Dyson to destroy his own research that would eventually lead to Skynet and Judgement Day.<br /><br />In the Sarah Connor Chronicles, Sarah (Lena Heady) and her teenage son John (Thomas Dekker) are fugitive nomads, moving from one remote town to another in order to stay under the radar, not only from the possibility of other Terminators, but also law enforcement.  However, that's not enough, and eventually a new Terminator model named Cameron (Summer Glau) meets up with the mother and son.  Luckily, Cameron is a newer T800 model - obviously prettier than all previous Terminators - sent by John to protect John.<br /><br />Wonderfully cast, with great special effects and acting, the story and drama follows the original storyline smoothly.  Since insiders have noted that this series is in a different timeline than T3, the story-arc can be eliminated for confused linear thinkers.<br /><br />It's very easy to become immersed in the plot for this series, and I'm already hooked.  There are years and years between John's childhood and his ascension to \\"Leader of Mankind\\", and the only thing in between this series and greatness is a lack of imagination.  The questions left by the first two movies (and even the blank spot between the second and third on that timeline) will be slowly answered, and John's formative years will vividly display how he learns to fulfill his destiny and become the wise, revolutionary leader of all future humankind.<br /><br />Highly recommended for action fans.all future humankind.    Highly recommended for action fans.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I love this CD. My old one was scratched up, so I had to get another, and a lower quality MP3 wasn't going to get the job done. FANTASIC!!!

031606792X|2.0|My big problem with Stephenie Meyer's writing is how weird it is - I don't mean the subject matter, with which she has done some very interesting and even innovative things, so much as how febrile imaginings take the place of actual plot and suspense; and narrative tension to move the story forward; and endings in which there are shocks and surprises, and actual twists and turns, rather than mere simplistic resolution (they were there at the right time! or, everyone agreed!)     I loved the imagining of the vampire condition. The big surprise of the pregnancy - the surprise to the reader, that is - the birth sequence (terrific) and the transformation from human to vampire (terrific) -- all of that was gripping. But there are great longeurs in this novel, as there were in the first (I skipped the middle novels), and it seems to me Ms Meyer has had great  success before she was required to develop as a writer.     Or maybe it is so, that she has developed as a writer to a fine degree in some areas, and to a poor degree in others. It's quite intriguing.     Maybe the point is that ultimately it's a romance novel, and the heroine is there to be adored, and the reader is to be supplied with an escapist fantasy of being desired to the point of insanity,  and fought over. I really enjoyed this in places, though I sped-read most of it. I admire the work as an achievement. But ultimately I'm just kind of puzzled.
1569242739|5.0|This book is the best thing that has happened to me in a long time! Not only am I vegan, but I'm allergic to gluten/wheat products!  And she includes a scrumptious vanilla and chocolate version of GF cupcakes in here! All a GF vegan has to do is substitute the GF cupcakes into any of the recipes in here and voila! An amazing cupcake that all your friends at work will ask you to make over and over..yes, they're vegan...and many \\"non-veg-savvy\\" are frightened at the prospect...but these cupcakes are total, over the top crowd pleasers!!! Even my boyfriend likes them...and he's a real \\"I like meat\\" kinda guy...if this book can win him over, it can win your man over too...not to mention your boss, your friends, your relatives...the list goes on and on and on...buy it...it's the best book I've bought in a long long time! You will not be disappointed.
B000AA305M|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  There are very few artists that I can say that about.  I love absolutely every single song on this disc. What more can I say?
B000KN7BOA|5.0|For anyone searching for pop music at it it's innovative best, your search is over! The Bee Gees 1st (their debut American album released in 1967) is by far (in my humble opinion) the best thing they have ever done. I compare these 14 original songs quite favourably to that of The Beatles, \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". No doubt, the more famous album by the world's premier recording artists sold tons more copies, and got far more air play. But nonetheless, \\"The Bee Gees 1st\\" is a classic! It spawned three hit singles, and the b-side of their debut single, \\"The New York Mining Disaster, 1941\\", \\"I Can't See Nobody\\" could of and should of been the a-side. It easily could have been a number one hit, but in those days only The Beatles received air play for the flip side (as their legendary chart success can attest). But on this fabulous album from the opening track \\"Turn of the Century\\" through the conclusion, \\"Close Another Door\\" I promise any listener will not be disappointed. I enjoyed this music when I first obtained it, and over forty years later I still revel in it's genius. The writing, (mostly penned by Barry and Robin,) the harmonies, the amazing production of each track, all blend together to ensure that this work will remain essential in the annals of music history. If there is a negative side to this production it is that subsequent recording did not keep pace, and eventually they developed that disco sound which I did not care very much for.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I love this CD! Its the perfect blend of his songs in various sounds. I love it!!!
B0017MO10U|5.0|This video pretty much captured the essence of what the Stargate SG-1 TV series was all about. I thought it was great! I liked that it was a one shot story that you didn't have to go back and remember what it was referring to. Don't get me wrong, I liked Ark of Truth a lot.<br /><br />Continuum was just plain fun. Which is what I loved about SG-1. The reason I gave it four instead of 5 stars is because the whole going back and changing the time line thing's been done almost to death. Though they did manage to portray the characters as outside of time in a fresh way. Aw, what the hell. I'll give it the fifth star.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series - BUY IT! You won't regret it. If you're not a fan, well, times a wastin' and you'd better get caught up. 'Cause you will be a fan.<br /><br />Buy this video!!!<br /><br />Oh, and buy anything that has to do with Firefly.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|I have no idea why \\"Speed Racer\\" was lambasted by critics when it was what it was: a popcorn summer blockbuster when the travesty that was \\"Transformers\\" got a pass and is getting a sequel. The car racing and the machines were great, I though the plotline was accessible and the actors did a decent job making cartoon characters \\"believable\\". What I did find somewhat irritating was the Spritle/ Chim-chim antics which to me became dangerously close to being the \\"Jar-Jar Binks\\" of the film. But all in all I left the theater feeling I watched a summer no-thinker movie that made me feel good for the day.
031606792X|4.0|I have never written a review for Amazon and felt compelled to do so after reading some of the ridiculous reviews here.  Frankly I am surprised at the negative reviews which seem a bit snooty.  I liked reading this book and I do not take it seriously because IT IS ABOUT VAMPIRES.  And here is my response to the negativity.    ****spoiler alert****    Firstly, I am tired hearing about the \\"powerful but wrong message\\" sent by this book.  I am 39 and have 4 kids all born in wedlock and all after the age of 30. I spent ALOT of time reading everything from trashy novels to 18th century British Lit in my youth.  In high school I read loads of books that would give the \\"wrong message\\" to young women (does anyone remenber FOREVER by Judy Blume???), and yet here I am, morally unscathed.  If young girls are getting \\"messages\\" from fantasy novels, it isn't the novel that is wrong.  SOMETHING ELSE IS WRONG.  Were we all influenced by Grease, the movie, to forget about being the good girl just to get the cool guy?? Stop blaming novels for the bad decisions of young people.      Secondly, let's not forget that this is a FANTASY and therefore, implausible things are bound to happen, like hey the existence of vampires.  I don't hear anyone criticising Shakespeare for his tidy endings (some violent, but mostly not realistic).  This is not a novel about realism.  And as for the reviewer who spoke of illogical outcomes, well, life is illogical and our reations and relationships to others are not always rational.  And a baby can change you completely.  Bella was having sex, so she got pregnant.  I have met plenty of people who did not want kids and when they got pregnant or even suspected an unplanned pregnancy, were actually happy and excited.  Bella's reactions are not illogical, not in someone who is truly compassionate.  Besides, she is married and supported. NOTICE BELLA DID NOT HAVE AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD.  so stop with the moralizing. She is only 18, but there have been many girls that young who have had to mature overnight due to their circomstances.  Bella has always been described as an old soul. My grandmother was 19 when she married.  My grandparents were married over 50 years when she died.  It has to do with the maturity and commitment and values of the couple.  Some people who marry at 40 are still immature.  I mean this is not unheard of.      I think the \\"message\\" I would have gotten as a young girl would be, what a nice committed vampire family who learned tolerance of those they once despised.  How great would it be to meet a nice vampire, if they really existed.  How nice to be in a truly committed relationship, where everyone takes care of each other.     Sure there are plot problems, but who cares?? She did not write this as a deep literary novel destined to be taught at the college level.  Relax, and enjoy the story.

B00180R06I|5.0|After eons of settling for one blury dupe-of-a-dupe after another, we finally have been presented with a decent print. Such Joy! The transfer is by far the best I've ever seen (I prefer the \\"English Text\\" version--included with this awesome set). The EXTRA's are a mindf***---wow! Just listen to that man talk! Brilliant, unaffected, enlightening etc. Thank you CRITERION! A joyous occasion. (Must take this opportunity to commend their magnificent restoration of NOSFERATU--it, too, is to die over...)
0670034711|4.0|This book was wonderful!  As for the negative reviews it received, I think these were written by the people who didn't quite grasp the premise of the book.  I felt like I was vacationing with the author, she was so descriptive with her tales of traveling to the foreign countries she wrote about.  In Italy, she let you experience the food and drink through her narrative and in India, you got to experience the spiritual awakening she unravelled and then in Indonesia, (my favorite)she taught you about the politics on the country and the people and culture that she encountered.  It was like being a fly on the wall in all her journeys.  I definately recommend this book.  It is a very spiritual, therefore \\"deep\\" book but if you are up to it, then go for it...you will only better yourself for reading it!
0060977493|1.0|I had high hopes for this book when I picked it up. Halfway through this book and I find that I have to force myself to turn the next page. If you love reading interesting and in depth books that you can understand, this is not the book for you. The author's words are a spiral of mumbo jumbo that drags on and on. I often found myself re-reading the same sentence 3 or 4 times in order to grasp the meaning but it never comes. If I had to compare this book to something, I would compare it to a long a strange dream... it doesn't make sense and it's not something you would remember after 5 minutes!

0061150142|5.0|\\"The Pact\\" by Jodi Picoult is one of those books that you will never forget.  Picoult points to what True Love should be about, along with examples of soulmates- how far would you go to make the one you love happy?  At what point do you say, \\"Enough about what you want, what about what I want?\\"<br />This is a story about suicide vs. murder.  It's a hard topic to discuss, but as Picoult often does- she flourishes with its descriptions and jumbles your mind - causing you to always second guess your original answers.<br />Picoult's story is wonderful. It has stayed with me for the past six months since I've read it.  It's one of those books that you want others to read, but you don't want to lend it out at the chance of never seeing it again.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|With deep foreboding, I walked into this movie braced for second rate animation (at least compared to Pixar), endless fights between cartoons (as in the CGI \\"Clone Wars\\"), and a cultural sensitivity that was either painfully preachy (like \\"Mulan\\") or outright insulting (like \\"Aladdin\\").      At first, my dread seemed confirmed.  Poor Dustin Hoffman mangles Chinese names without mercy - so much so that James Hong, Lucy Liu and Jackie Chan have to deliberately mispronounce stuff just to match what he says.    But once the movie got rolling, I found myself grinning from ear to ear in sheer delight.  Yes, it's true, Dreamworks can't compete with Pixar's technology, but they make up for it with beautiful graphic design, sheer wit and - of course - those hilariously quivering \\"Scrat Eyes\\".  What's more, the animators somehow manage to make Kung Fu battles between cartoons both exciting and enjoyable - every bit the match of live action fights (which nowadays are nothing more than CGI with faces pasted on).      However, the most remarkable thing about this film is how faithful it is to Chinese culture - family dynamics, Buddhist philosophy, values, and even martial arts - this film simply HAS to have been written by Chinese.  There is never a moment where it strains to \\"score points\\" with political correctness.  Its characters are never tediously noble \\"anti-stereotypes\\", but are instead lovingly depicted with all their flaws intact while uniquely Chinese messages are delicately hidden within a plot crammed with excitement and laughter.  Here you experience how parental love turns into suffocating pressure, here you see teenage rebellion as a monstrosity rather than a virtue, here you see the quirky characters of a city (complete with that wobbly \\"bound foot\\" walk), here you hear the wisdom of Zen detachment, and here you experience the sacred relationship between student and teacher.    Perhaps my opinion is biased by the surprise this movie gave to my low expectations,but I can't help but see this film as an unappreciated but precious gem.  Now if only someone could do the same thing with Islamic culture...!

031606792X|1.0|Meyer was never a great writer but her books always had a great story so I overlooked the horrible writing, but this was just horrible. She droned on for so many pages when every thing could have been said in less than 300 hundred pages. I reached page 200 and had to take Advil because she is so long winded and won't get to the damn point. Then her characters became so flat and had no personality to them. They seem to personify only one aspect of their personality to a very large extreme. The plot was also very ridiculous and stagnant. Like previously said I was already so far in the book and felt like the badly written plot was going no where.  Then all the loose ends she left in the previous three books were resolved with the most irritating and just plain stupid solutions. When I reached the end I felt cheated, and that she only wrote this unnecessarily long fourth book to get another paycheck and she succeeded. So now she isn't just a bad writer, but now we can add bad story teller to her list.

I think so, and I believe this because this is a much more raw, less-polished Pumpkins. Far better than when they reached their commericial success zenith.

031606792X|5.0|This book was amazing and I recieved it 2 days after it came out. I was very happy with it. Amazing storyline and great details. The characters really catch your interest and keep you hooked through all of Stephanie Meyer's Saga. This one was by far the best.
031606792X|5.0|I LOVED this book - wonderful story and despite what others have written, a great ending. I re-read the ending twice. I really liked the infusion of the different characters and how Ms. Meyer tied it up in the end. My only (and very big) regret is the series has apparently ended making this, in a way, a sad book. I don't want the story to end. I can see so much possibility for continuance of the story expanding it to include future events and other characters. I am pleased that Hollywood is making a movie of the first book - let us hope they continue to keep making movies of the rest of the books. This is a wonderful love story that should be told. Thank you Ms.Meyer! Another great book.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|As someone who saw the movie and loved every minute of it, I just had to have the music soundtrack.  Even though I own the Abbas greatest hits cd, the musical performances by the actors put a whole new spin on the songs which makes the music seem fresh and new and is just as infectious as the originals.  If this cd doesn't have you dancing and put a smile on your face, nothing will.
0451457994|5.0|This is a long lost classic for the true scifi fan.  For having been written  40 decades ago the book is surprisingly accurate in terms of technology.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself to be in fairly good shape.  I'm about 15 pounds heavier than I'd like to be, but I go the gym at least 3 days a week.  I usually run a mile and do a 12-machine weight circuit.  I'm a single mom and a full-time student and I got this video to supplement at home when I can't get to the gym.  I watched the level 1 first it and it looked like it would be pretty easy.  However, when I actually tried it, I got my a$$ handed to me.  It was I-N-T-E-N-S-E!  I sweated more in that 20 minutes than I ever do at gym.  I'm completely sold on this and can't wait to see the results!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Before Dire Straits found themselves plastered on MTV's heavy rotation with Money for Nothing, they were artists in every sense of the word.  And this was their classic: MAKING MOVIES - featuring signature guitars which seemed to glide across and above everything, counterpointed with Mark Knopfler's unspectacular but gentle voice.<br /><br />Listening to how they executed this with such verve and vision, one realises they don't make albums like that anymore (I do hear echoes of this in the Wallflowers first release but it ain't the same)  Along with their debut, Dire Straits never made a better album than this one.  Romeo and Juliet and Tunnel of Love - these are some of the most romantic guitar paeans ever written.  I love the integrity of this album.  It's timeless and precious, and cinematic.
0634089358|5.0|Ed Friedland might not be the most famous bass player around but he is in my book the best bass education book writer. Blues Bass takes you step by step from simple blues lines to more complex songs. The tab is very helpful for somebody who has a hard time to read music and the play along CD really helps. As an adult in my mid 40's struggling to learn bass the help he conveys through is book has been invaluable. Yes I do have a bass teacher but working on his Ed Friedland's material with my teacher is really terrific. I have also used his \\"Bass Grooves\\" book and Blues Method 1, 2 and 3 books. All of them take you very progressively from simple things to more complex one. Many books push too many things at the same time at their audience. This author has a real talent for breaking things down into bites that are manageable. The song selection of Blues Bass is also fantastic and allows the student to learn songs that are fun to play. I should also say that it is quite extensive and it covers pretty much all the standards. This book should be part of any bass library, it's a great book for learning and it's a great reference book, who knows \\"Born under a bad sign\\" or \\"Stormy Monday\\" might be on your next play list!  Thank you Mr. Friedland for a fantastic book, you have really helped me learn the blues.
B0000CDL93|3.0|I've rated Stone's 'JFK' 3 stars not because of quality or accuracy but because this movie had a major impact on me.  In my first watching of this film, I detected at least one major, and I think deliberate, factual error.  One of the characters is handing a Carcano rifle as another character says words to the effect, \\"The three shots took 7.8 seconds to fire.  Let's time it.\\"  He then picks up a stopwatch and clicks, \\"Go.\\"  The other character, works the action [once], he works the action again [twice], he works the action a third time [three].  \\"9.2 seconds,\\" the one man emotes.  \\"Impossible.\\"<br /><br />Well, from reading over reports of the shooting I knew that this scenario was an untruth.  The timing was from the moment of the sound of the first shot--a couple of seconds after the first levering.<br /><br />Fascinated by such an obvious error and, considering the fact that I am a pathologist and a shooter, I decided to redo the entire shooting scenario--personally--using the same type Carcano-Mannlicher rifle and the same type ammunition that the FBI claimed Oswald used.  I performed accuracy, rate of fire, bullet penetration, bullet deformation, head deflection and other studies.  By the time I was finished, I probably did as much ballistic work with the Kennedy shooting as anyone in the world, not excluding the FBI and CIA.<br /><br />If you're interested in the results of my ballistic studies, try my website at [...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, MD, author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico
B0017MO10U|5.0|As a loyal fan of the Stargate franchise since the very first movie...I applaud the actors, writers and producers/director for a job well done!  It still takes some getting used to a 'feature-length movie' vs 'made for television'; meaning I was so used to them getting right to it, that I had to learn how to sit back, relax and let the actors take me there.  I can only say that I was very satisfied with this purchase and I have a little bit more of Stargate in my home...where it belongs.  Thanks!  Darryl  Cincinnati, OH

0141439661|5.0|One of the best things you can do for yourself is to read or reread one of Jane Austen's books. Any one will do, if it's for the first time or the 25th. It always gives the same energising feeling, like listening to a Beatles song or going on a successful shopping spree.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" from 1811 is Jane Austen's first published book and has all the characteristics of her entire authorship: A lively delineation of character and a plot that zooms in on relations between people - and luckily often the most mysterious, satisfying, dramatic and confusing - love in its most exciting phase: falling in love. Language and style are elegant and intelligent and imbued with a deep ironic humour, which comes from a keen eye for tensions between opposites.<br /><br />Five stars, always, for Jane.

B00000269M|5.0|Amazingly, Michael Jackson turns 50 today. While these days, he's in the press for all the wrong reasons (well, most of the time), there was a time he was also in the press mainly about the great music he released.<br /><br />1987 was such a time. The world was waiting hungrily for his follow up to the Grammy guzzling, best selling album ever (a record it holds to date), and Michael wisely reteamed with super producer Quincy Jones. The album found Michael penning 9 of the 11 tracks, the first time so many of his songs were used on any of his albums and showing his growing confidence as a songwriter.<br /><br />While there are those that believe \\"Thriller\\" to be the best album ever released, I feel \\"Bad\\" was an excellent follow up, as good as, or even better than \\"Thriller\\". Lead-off single, the syrupy sweet duet with sound alike Sieddah Garret (the #1 hit \\"I just can't stop loving you\\") aside, every track is a delight.<br /><br />#1 hit \\"Bad\\" has a deep sonuous riff and blaring horns racing ahead at full speed. #1 hit \\"The way you make me feel\\" has a swinging retro whiplash feel, \\"Speed demon\\" with its sparse funky riff and skeletal beats finds Michael treading in Prince territory, the bewitching ballad \\"Liberian girl\\" with excellent vocal layering and a sensuous groove (which oddly features some lyrics in the un-Liberian language Swahili. The video was a star studded affair), and the energetic funky duet \\"Just good friends\\" with Stevie Wonder. Michael would return the favour on \\"Get it\\" from Wonder's \\"Characters\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Another part of me\\" is a funky horn peppered futuristic tale which will get you moving. The #1 hit \\"Man in the mirror\\" features one of Michael's most emotional performances, backed by a stunning choral performance by the Andre Crouch Choir. Unfortunately, it seems he was so inspired by this song, he later went on to pen the rather maudlin \\"Heal the world\\", \\"Earth song\\", et all.<br /><br />The #1 hit \\"Dirty diana\\" is a hard Rock number alternating between gentle haunting verses and an explosive chorus, telling the tale of a Rock groupie. It features a blistering guitar solo by Steve Stevens.<br /><br />\\"Smooth criminal\\" is high-octane Dance/Pop, one of the catchiest songs on the album (and featured the heartbeat of his then manager Frank DiLeo, no doubt worrying about sales of the album), and closing is his message to the press, the rolicking Pop song \\"Leave me alone\\", a UK #2 hit.<br /><br />The album \\"Bad\\" had an unprecedented 5 US #1 singles (the only album to date to achieve this feat) and 8 UK top 20 hits, and sold about 25 million copies worldwide (including becoming his biggest selling album ever in the UK). While not matching sales of \\"Thriller\\", I bet it helped calm Mr DiLeo's pulse rate.es and an explosive chorus, telling the tale of a Rock groupie.

B001BKXUOQ|5.0|I'm a fairly new Slipknot fan.  I started with their live album and then worked my way backwards.  Then I listened to All Hope is Gone and now I'm sold.  I've noticed that with each album, Slipknot seemed to grow musically and lyrically.  It's only so many times you can hear double bass drumming, heavily distorted guitars, and screaming lines before it gets worn out.  I think All Hope is Gone has shown Slipknot's maturation into a metal band that can be lyrical, melodic and heavy at the same time.  At first listen, I loved the album, but I thought to myself that the hardcore maggots were gonna hate it.  If they do, then they really aren't true music fans.  If you love a group, you can respect when they try to do something new and different.  You may not always agree with the musical direction, but you can at least be appreciative of a band's willingness to try something different.      Overall, a great album!
B001B7CNXI|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. I didn't think that I would since I watched the TV series regularly. I didn't think that it would compare and I don't think that the director tried to compare it and that is why it worked. I purchased the blu-ray edition of this movie. What I do not understand is why they would purposefull have so much graininess in this film. It goes beyond graininess in some shots to down right horrid. This is definitely not the movie that you want to play to show off your hi-def television and blu-ray to your neighbors. The poor video quality does nothing for the movie but distract and irritate me. I should have stuck with the standard DVD in this case as there is very little difference between it and the blu-ray.

055358202X|4.0|I thought this was a great continuation of Martin's ground-breaking \\"fantasy\\" series.  Lots of people have whined about this book on Amazon: \\"it's too slow, the major players are missing, etc.\\"  The whiners miss the point.  The story has never been about the major players.  You think you know who's important only to have your assumptions dashed.    What I like about this installment (and what likely frustrates others) is the suspense.  The whole book is 1,000 pages of gunpowder trails crisscrossing across the landscape, waiting for someone - or something - to blow it all.  What could that be?  Dragons...    \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is on its way...someday.

B00005J6T1|3.0|Many years back I woke up in the early hours on  a Sunday morning in a park in Barcelona. I was still incredibly drunk. I had a few bucks in my pocket, my passport and a picture disc copy of Madonna's fist lp. Strangely I had no recollection of how I got the lp but it was enclosed in a record shop plastic bag, so i was sure I had not stolen the thing. The lp itself had a rather attractive topless photo of the singer looking somewhat like Marilyn Monroe.       Within my wallet was a basic map of the city and so I felt confident enough of finding my hotel......eventually. I was in no mood to move quickly or think much beyond finding an open cafe or at least walking in vaguely the right direction. During my slow meandering I noticed that the only people on the streets were me and the cops. All good folk were in bed, getting ready to go to church, on their way to church or at church. A cop with a strange metal helmet on eventually stopped me and asked for identification. When satisfied, he checked out my Madonna picture disc. As he smirked checking out the record I could not help but think he looked like a futuristic matador from the year 2050. My blood shot eyes and sex pistols t-shirt convinced me not to attempt telling \\"officer friendly\\" I was on my way to mass. He knew I was lost and so I showed him my hotel address. He invited me to follow him and I assumed we were going to my destination. We passed streets I recognized, this  time without the pick pockets and prostitutes harassing passers by.         Eventually I walked into a local police station and was escorted to a recreation area towards the back of the station. Several male cops were drinking, smoking, and playing cards and generally relaxing. The Madonna record was placed on the turn table and suddenly every Spaniard knew English, belting out the lyrics. Understandably in the early 80's you couldn't walk 3 blocks without hearing a Madonna song. It certainly seemed like the Spanish cops took too her stuff like \\"bulls to a red rag.\\" I had a few beers and staggered back to my hotel. I slept for many hours and on waking debated with myself about if I had dreamed about the interaction with the cops. I had these cheesy Madonna songs buzzing around my head.         Sometime later I answered a knock on the door and one of the cops down at the station shook my hand and returned my record. It had confirmed the experience had occurred.

If you want fluff and lots of complicated language, check out Getting Things Done by David Allen.

I like to play Eat that Frog and The Ultimate Goals Program over and over again in my car.

B00019PDKC|4.0|A great atmospheric Floydian work that keeps you interested. Great sound that would make Roger Waters smile. I hope to hear more from this band in the future. I'll stay away from their early Cookie Monster vocal CDs being that I despise that and think it is silly. Maybe that's why this band dropped that approach several years ago. Good for them. Maybe Opeth will follow suit.
B000002A3T|3.0|Come on let's get honest here.  Floyd music post Water's is just regular well polished soft rock.   Their is no edge to it at all, not that it is bad but it is not what I would call Floyd worthy.  But I guess that is what Pink Floyd is now.           Take for example Nick Mason's drumming, it is just  a tempo, a beat to keep up with.  If you listen to,or watch him perform \\"Set the Controls...\\" or \\"A Saucer Full of Secrets\\"   he was a major player in the sound of Pink Floyd. And really all through every Floyd record to \\"The Final Cut\\"  Here reduced to that of a session member.         If you listen now to \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" performed live for example on \\"Pulse\\" or any of the live shows Gilmour does now or any recordings from live shows of Floyd, post 1983 It is so polished and soft.  Easy to listen to, I must admit, and yes still good, but not the hard rocking song with strong guitars, when they first began to play it in 1974. In the live shows from them it is absolutely rockin'and experimental, along with all their music up untill 1983.        Gilmour showed us what he was truely into from his self proclaimed favorite Floyd album \\"Wish You Were Here\\" to his self titled solo record to the last two studio albums. It is all just  melodic (yet good, I must say)soft rock music but that is all. In no form can you relate this to previous works.  No denying what an influence role Waters played in the making of every Floyd album he was associated with.        Please don't get the idea that I am bashing Gilmour or the music he has made. But it is undenyably different from, and inferior to, any thing pre 1983.  I know that thier are legions of Floyd fans who will not agree for the sake of loyalty to Floyd as a whole.  I am, barring none, the biggest Pink Floyd fan of all, but this is just easy listening, soft rock music. >>>---Zen--->

B0018CWEYY|3.0|So long as you own a blu-ray dvd player or a playstation, you need not waste money on blu-ray movies. I repeat, you need not waste money on blu-ray movies so long as you own a blu-ray dvd player. There is NO difference in picture quality between a regular dvd and a blu-ray dvd when played on a blue ray dvd player or on a playstation. However, they is a major difference in picture quality when comparing regular DVD's played on standard DVD players and blu-ray movies played on blu-ray players.   Such is the case w/ Lost season 4. Why pay double the price for Blu-ray? If you already own a blu-ray DVD player or a playstation, don't bother w/ the blu-ray version. That's because blu-ray players UPGRADE regular DVDs to the point that they look imperceptibly alike even on high-def, flat-screen televisions. In my opinion, there is no discernible difference between blu-ray discs and standard discs when played on blu-ray players.
0143113100|4.0|For decades now there has been a longstanding feud between biologists and psychologists on how the human brain forms and develops -- otherwise known as the nature versus nurture debate. Evolutionary biology teaches us that genes is destiny, and with his book the Canadian psychiatrist Norman Doidge makes his case for individual agency and cultural influences.    Like Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, & Steel\\" Dr. Doidge's book is not original research but rather a synthesis and summary from the frontiers of brain science. Supplemented with case studies \\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\" is about neuroplasticity, which argues that the brain is \\"plastic,\\" or organic and malleable. For hundreds of years, thanks to thinkers like Rene Descartes, scientists have thought of the brain as mechanical, certain functions localized to certain sectors in this machine -- over time it rusts, with no chance of regeneration. Thanks to decades of research by a brave few who dared to defy their mainstream bethren and to the invention of brain scans neuroplasticity is now the accepted view.    The good news about neuroplasticity is that the brain you have is the brain you make it. New external stimuli (such as learning a new language) causes new neural connections in the brain (the \\"neurons that fire together wire together\\" rule of neuroplasticity). Often when we're learning a new language or skill after some fast improvement in the early stages we reach a plateau where we seem to have no improvement at all. Then after a while we suddenly make a great leap. That's because it takes time (as measured by nights of good sleep) for these neural connections to consolidate themselves but once they do we can move onto the next level. Of course if we don't keep on practising this skill these connections will weaken (the \\"use it or lose it\\" rule of plasticity) because space in the brain is, after all, limited.    Individual agency over our brains gives great hope to those who suffer from aging and braindamage. Scientists have developed brain exercises on the computer to help the elderly maintain a sharp and alert mind, and help stroke victims restore once lost cognitive functions.    The bad news is that the brain you have is the brain that you make it, and unfortunately most of us choose the path of least resistance and decide not to use it at all. As Dr. Doidge explains the plastic paradox means that exposing yourself to new stimuli can make the brain flexible but choosing to stay within your comfort zone will also make the brain rigid. Learning is fast and furious when we're kids but as we reach adulthood the brain becomes less plastic, making learning more difficult, and instead of choosing to learn most of us choose merely to rely on our current belief system. And when the world challenges this belief system we choose to ignore the world, and if forced we'll opt to fight the world. Thus, the plastic brain that allows us to learn new languages can also paradoxically make us intolerant and racist.    Indeed, as Dr. Doidge warns us, the individuals that he profiles who have managed to change themselves have done so because they make a honest and hard commitment to change themselves. Dr. Doidge's patients went into psychotherapy (which operates from the principles of neuroplasticity) to discover how trauma created unhealthy neural connections, and how through discussion, self-analysis, and will-power to create new neural connections. But this process is painful and costly and takes many years.    And it's so hard because the brain is so adept at protecting us. When we suffer a physical injury the brain will actually decide on what the appropriate level of pain we feel is. And when we're traumatized when we're young (for example, our mother dies or we're sexually abused) the brain will often decide to not convert this experience into long-term memory, and build defenses to disassociate ourselves from the possible pain of further trauma. The net effect is that ourhippocampus -- the area of our frontal lobe that transfers experience into long-term memory, and thus what governs our ability to learn -- will shrink, thereby giving a scientific explanation to why adult victims of childhood trauma seem so adolescent and immature.    Neuroplasticity offers hope though: love. It seems that our neural network will automatically become more flexible in two critical periods of our adulthood: when we fall in love, and when we have children. Presumably it's because in both instances we need to urgently learn a new skillset to match the two most important circumstances we could find ourselves in. So being in love with someone does allow you to change who you are. Of course, being the circumspect doctor, Dr. Doidge reminds us that if we find ourselves in love with the wrong person we can change for the worst as well, seeing our confidence and healthy attitude suddenly shatter.    I'm not sure how Dr. Doidge would view my summary of his book, because I've taken great liberty in summarizing it. It's a pithy book and there's really a lot of refreshing and insightful material in the book but I'm not happy about the writing style -- which seems rushed and choppy to me -- and the organization, which hurts the clarity and effectiveness of the book. I've read quite a lot on the workings of the brain so I could follow through most chapters but I think a novice will have a particularly hard time reading this book. For a great introduction to how the mind works I suggest watching the BBC documentary series \\"The Human Series,\\" hosted by Robert Winston -- possibly the greatest documentary series ever made.
031606792X|1.0|It was quite simply the worst book I've ever read. Not worth buying whatsoever. The last 3 Twilight books were okay but this was just horrible. It consisted of things that could never in a million years happen (even for vampires) and was so boring (read: happily happy happily ever after oh joy!) I think I might have fallen asleep once or twice while reading it.

0743455967|5.0|Mr. King's story of his development into a noted and successful writer and his description of the writing craft is only one man's story, but a unique and inspiring one.  Think of it as the first half of his autobiography - may he live long and well!  Also, think of it as his tutorial and elucidation on how to write something worth reading.  Two tales in one unique book.    King's early life was tumultuous; the reader begins to see how the writer of rather unusual stories was formed.  After learning about his extended starving artist time, the reader easily celebrates his well-earned success and acclaim.  His recovery from the near-fatal attack by a minivan illustrates real grit, and the extremely positive influence of his wife on his life it wonderful.  King is almost as interesting a character as he the many he give us in his best books.    The greatest value of the book, however, at least to writers and wanna-be's, is in his candid explanations on how to compose, edit, re-compose, edit, edit again, re-write, proofread, and cut until the manuscript shines.  Even for a master and journeyman like Mr. King, writing top-notch fiction requires focus, sweat, and time.  It's tiring.  I imagine if he could work more than four concentrated hours a day he would.  While his description of the author's daily life is not glamorous, it nonetheless is realistic, and illustrates how a true writer can never be satisfied NOT writing.    Whether or not you usually read Mr. King's variety of fiction, if you even dabble a small amount as a writer you can benefit tremendously from what he has included in this wonderful volume.
031606792X|1.0|For books who have always been a guilty pleasure, the anticipation of the release of this book was better than actually reading it.  Bella's inability to grow as a character (figuratively and literally)was one of the most painful disappointments in the book.  Her lack of growth because more obvious everytime her mother, Renee, always loves to tell her, \\"You've always been an old soul. Older than your age,\\" to paraphase.  Unfortunately, I guess what was meant by \\"old soul\\" didn't mean a late adolescent with fully formed complexicities and depth.  Instead, Bella must have been as mature as self-centered Hollywood starlet maybe five years older than her actual age.  Bella continues to be whiny and clingy as she was in the first.  Her lack of growth and concern for others echoes perfectly in the culture we live in today, but does not make it right.  Bella's concerns rarely are about others, it's about what Bella wants, Bella gets.  No sacrifice is made by her part, everything falls into place.      Beyond the terrible character growth, the ending itself is weak as the rest of the story. The ending is a huge let down to the anticipation of an actual fight, a dramatic change in structure in the \\"vampire\\" world. What instead happens is a whimper, no change, no weakening, nothing.     I read the book in about a day and returned it to get my money back.  I have no plans to keep this book permanently in my collection or kindle.  Now, if only someone could reimburse me for lost time.

B00026ZG10|4.0|To some people Arnold's career came to a flaming crash with \\"The Last Action Hero,\\" which while not quite as bad as it's reputation is, was still a pretty lousy movie. However, to someone who had the aura of never making a mistake it was shattering.  \\"True Lies\\" was a near return to form, bringing back all of Arnold's humor, action, and a few good one liners. However, the writing was already on the wall, for the humor supplants the seriousness of the action, and Arnold's good guy mystique starts to wear thin.  Taken by itself \\"True Lies\\" is a decent movie with enough going on to keep the viewer's interest, and a pretty wild final action sequence. Sadly it seems as if this was the last gasp of a spectacular career.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Excellent acting, wonderful costumes and sets and a great script makes this mini-series thoroughly enjoyable.  Laura Linney's performance is worth it alone.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|With Episode 2 currently in the theaters, and many people complaining about how shallow that movie is, and how unbelievable the story and how much better the original trilogy was etc, I think it's time to make a comment.  First of all, Star Wars movies have NEVER,EVER,EVER had a good story. They're basically about the age-old tale of good vs. evil, set in various locations in a galaxy far far away. The plot is usually full of holes, the whole thing often depends on extreme coincidences and every Imperial superweapon has a verious obvious flaw that any apprentice engineer could have found in five minutes. This movie, Episode 4, is probably the most basic of them all. The main point is, Star Wars was never SUPPOSED to be about the story. It's basically a lot of (brilliant) nonsense put together, and it works just fine because the makers know that it's nonsense and make the best of it. That being said, the level of creativity in making up all those aliens, vehicles, space ships etc. is unmatched.  When we look at Episode 4 specifically, we see a corny story full of lucky escapes and loose ends about a farmboy saving a princess, and the Universe too, while he is at it. The acting is nothing special, the dialogue can be god-awful at times (OK, not a bad as Episode 1), and the first hour of the movie is quite slow. But it's still a lot of fun ! Star Wars is entertainment and escapism in it's purest form. It was 25 years ago and it still is.
B00005J73X|4.0|I purchase this product because it was like a greatest hits album, it is up tempo, unlike the other hits CD, and I like Bon Jovi's music.

B00188KD1Y|1.0|Today on \\"Death Race\\", the final leg of the race to determine which actor has made the worst mistake in their career.<br /><br />If you're just tuning in, Hollywood is so bankrupt for ideas to make into movies, to keep the distribution pipeline flowing, they have begun to remake a number of films from the 60s and 70s. Some of these original films are questionable to begin with, but studio executives, producers and directors believe that if they throw modern special effects and a lot of money at ideas that were just okay to begin with, they will be able to remake the film. The new film will be bigger, stronger and faster. Could it start a franchise? Let's hope so, because these studios need some films to fill theaters, to create publicity for the DVD release, fueling the PPV run, which will in turn be great for the cable and television windows.<br /><br />This is the reason Universal Studios decided to green light \\"Death Race\\", the 'new' film from writer and director Paul W.S. Anderson, the man behind \\"Mortal Kombat\\", \\"Resident Evil\\", \\"Event Horizon\\" and \\"AVP: Alien Vs. Predator\\". (Notice the preponderance of films based on video games.) Based on a Roger Corman film, the writer-director has moved the story forward a few years and upped the action ante by making the violence more extreme and cartoon-like, more violent and more video game like.<br /><br />In the first stage of \\"Death Race\\", we learn all about the future. It is 2012 and America's economy has collapsed. Crime is on the rise and America's prisons are now run by corporations for profit. On Terminal Island, the warden (Joan Allen. Friggin' Joan Allen is in this piece of crap? More on that later) has come up with the idea of the Death Race, a pay-per-view event allowing people to watch prisoners race souped up cars through an obstacle course. Any prisoner that wins five races wins their freedom. Everyone else? They die. But of course, no one has won five races yet. Hennessey (that's the warden's name and because she only has a last name and also has a sidekick sadistic guard who does her bidding, you know she's going to be one tough customer) decides to up the viewer ship by pitting a former racecar driver, Jensen Ames (Jason Statham, \\"The Bank Job\\", \\"The Transporter\\"), who has just arrived at her prison, against her rogues gallery of drivers. He is serving time for killing his wife and reluctantly agrees to participate against a rogue's gallery of drivers, including Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). He adopts the pit crew of the driver he is replacing (he died) and Coach (Ian McShane) and his co-horts try to help Jensen win the race. But Jensen begins to put two and two together and begins to realize he might never win the race, despite the warden's assurances. So he takes matters into his own hands.<br /><br />In Stage Two of \\"Death Race\\", viewer ship is up by millions as Jensen and the rest of the drivers drove through the course, at breakneck speeds, driving over markers in the road granting them special weapons like 'bullets' and 'napalm' (there's the video game element Anderson seems to crave). They want to get there first, and start using the weapons for defense. If they don't, the weapons will be turned on them.<br /><br />Much like the other rounds, viewers increase as drivers are killed and get in accidents leaving only a few drivers for each round. But in Stage Three, the final stage, the number of viewers plummets as Universal Studios realizes how few people are interested in watching this piece of drivel. And the actors soon realize what a mistake it was too appear in such a film. Sure, some actors will benefit from any exposure; Natalie Martinez who plays Case, Jensen's navigator, could only benefit; this is her first film, following some television work. She is pretty and the character walks around in skimpy t-shirts and daisy dukes. I'm sure this is regulation wear any time someone gets into a racecar, but that seems irrelevant to the filmmakers. And Jason Statham is the star. No one really expects a Jason Statham film to be memorable for anything other than the over choreographed action scenes. When he makes a film like \\"The Bank Job\\", it is a complete surprise to everyone, including the actor himself, that anything with his name attached could be that good. So, their careers won't be damaged by their appearance in \\"Death Race\\".<br /><br />For Stage Three, we have two contenders left. The well respected, critically acclaimed, Oscar nominated Joan Allen will battle it out with Ian McShane, the once promising British actor. The winner will have their participation in this film crowned the \\"Biggest Blunder of their Career\\".<br /><br />First, let's consider the case of Ian McShane. McShane helped to create the very memorable Al Swearengen in HBO's \\"Deadwood\\". Before and since the show ended, he has appeared in a number of promising films, but he seems destined to be a character actor. None of his film work has sent the world a buzzing. Perhaps the most interesting choice he has made was to appear in Woody Allen's \\"Scoop\\". This is the writer- director's second London-based film, the non-\\"Matchpoint\\" film. In short, \\"Scoop\\" is a terrible film starring Scarlett Johansson, Hugh Jackman, McShane and Woody Allen. Johansson and Allen team up to uncover whether Jackman's character is a killer. But Johansson becomes attracted to the dashing Jackman while Allen does his shtick as her sidekick. McShane plays a ghost, one of the killer's victims. So the film is pretty bad, but McShane's small role is interesting. McShane also had a small part in \\"The Golden Compass\\", but that film flopped. His best film work to date has been his voice work for \\"Kung Fu Panda\\", creating the character Tai Lung, a fearsome white tiger. His work helps make Tai Lung one of the best-animated villains to come along in a long time. His other film work is pretty forgettable.<br /><br />So, it almost seems acceptable for McShane to appear in \\"Death Race\\". He is a character actor and his appearance helps to make him more recognizable. The next time the ten people who saw \\"Death Race\\" see him, they'll go \\"Oh, he played 'Coach' in \\"Race to the Death\\"\\". Hopefully, they will be watching a better film the next time they see him on the silver screen.<br /><br />Joan Allen has been nominated for two Academy Awards. Joan Allen should stay far away from films like \\"Death Race\\". After her appearances in films like \\"The Bourne Trilogy\\", \\"The Ice Storm\\", \\"The Crucible\\" and \\"Pleasantville\\" among others, she should have two types of films being offered to her on a regular basis. Great female roles and even better female roles. She can play tough women (Pamela Lundy in \\"The Bourne\\" films), unhappy housewives (\\"The Ice Storm\\" and \\"Pleasantville\\"), a very bitter divorcee (\\"The Upside of Anger\\"), Pat Nixon (\\"Nixon\\") and more. She has range.<br /><br />I am unsure why or how she ended up in \\"Death Race\\". If it was her agent's advice, she needs a new agent. If she wanted to take the role, for a change of pace, to play a tough woman, she has played tough women before. The role can't be that much of a stretch. I know every actor looks for new challenges, especially when you are as talented as Allen is in her craft, but taking on a role of this caliber is simply below her. I know every actress wants to have the \\"Ripley\\" (Sigourney Weaver in the \\"Alien\\" films) role on her resume, but Hennessey is no Ripley, so it doesn't add anything to her career. Allen should follow the example of Meryl Streep. Critically acclaimed, Streep seems to garner Oscar nominations as quickly as she makes films. But the films she earns these nominations for are extremely serious, weighty films. \\"Sophie's Choice\\", \\"Out of Africa\\", \\"Kramer Vs. Kramer\\", \\"Silkwood\\". Streep has taken on a diverse group of roles beyond this, to provide challenges for herself and to broaden her repertoire. Everything from comedy (\\"She-Devil\\", \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\") to kid's films (\\"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\\") to musicals (\\"Mamma Mia!\\"). Sure, there have been some misses in Streep's career, but her track record is very high. Streep has range and has an incredible track record choosing the right projects with the right writers and directors attached, the right co-stars, the right subject matter.<br /><br />Allen could have the same career. She has started to build the same sort of resume and reputation. But if she chooses too many films like \\"Death Race\\", takes too many large paychecks for the wrong films, her career will be affected. She might find herself playing character roles instead of leading roles. She might find herself taking more and more films with directors attached who are best known for adapting video games to the silver screen. She might find her next co-star is Vin Diesel or Jason Statham.<br /><br />Oh, wait a minute... Right...<br /><br />So at the send of stage three, we find the winner of \\"Death Race\\" is Joan Allen. And the winner is, in fact, the loser.e recognizable. The next time the ten people who saw \\"Death Race\\" see him, they'll go \\"Oh, he played 'Coach' in \\"Race to the Death\\"\\".

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|An excellent film, good picture and superb audio.  I owned the dvd version and it simply doesn't compare. Great features and a great film.  After watching it again, you get a sense that the Matrix films borrowed heavily from the film.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Received this item in prompt time, packaged and parcelled to my perfection will shop again and again with Amazon. Very sound.
B00028HBKM|4.0|The other night, I went to see Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" again. I must admit I didn't like it any better this time. I thought that, on second viewing, the movie would just fly by, as so often happens when you resee a film. On the contrary, I found it long and, at one point, I actually started nodding off. (Not during the flogging scene, I can assure you of that. I felt more distant and remote then, less viscerally affected by the violence.)  While I didn't like \\"The Passion\\" any better, I did come away with a greater understanding of the imagery Gibson uses -- more specifically, its roots in scripture. For instance, I realized that he was portraying Judas as mad -- possessed, in fact -- based on the gospel verse that says, \\"The devil entered into him.\\" At the beginning, when Jesus steps on the serpent and kills it, that echoes a verse in Genesis: \\"He shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for his heel.\\" This verse has traditionally been seen as God's promise of a Redeemer for a fallen humanity.  The problem is, how many moviegoers today will be aware of these biblical references -- even Christians? Gibson's film is obviously a testament to his own faith. But he has made the assumption that everybody else shares that belief, and has thus made a film that, in effect, preaches to the converted. What about those who do not believe, or who simply do not know about Jesus? Gibson's \\"Passion\\" will not reach them because it does not speak, does not even try to speak, their language.  The other problem is that Gibson's version of the death of Christ is a hodge-podge of biblical influences, popular piety and his own idiosyncratic touches. Jesus's trek along the Via Dolorosa reflects, not the gospels, but the Stations of the Cross you find in every Catholic church. Many of the 15 stations portray events not mentioned in the gospels. Again, how many people in the audience will be able to separate fact from fiction?  One final note: \\"The Passion\\" has beenaccused of fostering anti-Semitism, yet it tells the story of One who was Himself a Jew. More than that, His death took place against the backdrop of one of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar, Passover. When Mary says, \\"Why is this night different from all other nights?\\" she echoes the question asked by the youngest male member of every observant Jewish family on Passover night. And Jesus's Last Supper was a Passover meal. This is hinted at, but not fully brought out in the film.  In short, Gibson takes too much for granted, assumes that his audience shares his knowledge of the Christian faith -- and misses a golden opportunity to explain that faith to others.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Back in the very early days of what was the called Rock & Roll, guys like Elvis and Bill Haley and the Comets, \\"Rock\\" was kind of a big band boogie kind of affair. For me at least it wasn't really Rock until a little trio from Texas came along called Buddy Holly and the Crickets. Rock was pared down to its bones, a bass, a guitar and drums, with edgy lyrics that people didn't know exactly what to do with.<br /><br />In that fine tradition came this little band from Texas, and a new generation of Tex Rock was born.  After its release, Tres Hombres was the one album that always got played at any party I went to in High School, and all the guys thought of themselves as Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers. At one dance at my school, the band was playing \\"La Grange\\" and I didn't like the way the vocalist was singing, so I took the mike, and sang it myself. All my friends went crazy, and the band didn't seem to mind, because the next time they played where I was, the smiled and pointed, and said \\"Hey, there's that dude!\\"<br /><br />Now over the years, I have gladly outgrown the lifestyle, but still, I love to crank this great CD up from time to time, and remember the days when I was want to do stupid things, just because I could, the fun and the friends, and the music. Life's been good to me.<br /><br />So here's the deal, if you don't know this album, it (for me) is still the best thing that ZZ Top has done, and it is a great example of Party Rock from the Mid 70's

B00004WLXZ|5.0|Triumph of the Will is an absolutley stunning photographic masterpiece. Bearing in mind it was made nearly 80 years ago, Leni Riefenstahl's photgraphic techniques are nothing short of brilliant. It was very interesting to note that many of Adolf Hitler's speeches were fairly bland, but the way he put it over was quite outstanding. In places it nearly had me up on my feet with my arm in the air! It shows how he was able to captivate millions with the power of his oratory.
B0018RWMNM|4.0|I am not going to re-hash what other reviewers have said about the Blu-Ray version of this great film, they are very accurate and I agree with all the criticism. I suggest you not waste money on the Blu-ray and get the standard, you will still get the widescreen and all the extras. This is the same problem I found in the new DVD, Les Mis (see my review)VERY grainey, particularly on interior shots and night scenes. Go cheap on this one.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|This cd is one that will grow on you.  Peoples music taste and style change through time.  That is what has happened here.  A diverse, new, and different set of songs.  Give it some time and you will appreciate it.

0930289234|5.0|I, like many others, had no intention of seeking out or reading this book up until about 3 months ago.  When the movie was announced and the trailer hit I was stoked.  Picked up a copy of the Graphic Novel and drove right in.<br /><br />This is really pretty heavy stuff; layered story telling, profound philosophical musings from some offbeat yet familiar heroes. The story offers a little something for everyone, intrigue and mystery on the surface, eye opening concepts about existence, strong character drama, gore, and a good old fashion comic story.<br /><br />There is a multitude of different approaches one can take when reading this story and that in itself sets it apart from nearly every other story I have read recently.  Whether the film adaptation can live up to the promise of the novel is a mystery, but if it does....move over Dark Knight because this could be the single greatest comic story ever written.<br /><br />As a side note, I don't know whether I got a special edition or not, but my copy had small supplemental chapters in between each chapter.  These extra pages really enlighten key points of the story as you move along and are a great companion piece.<br /><br />This is absolutely recommended.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a fantastic adventure packed with humor.  Ellen Degeneres is amazing as Dora a forgetful but ever caring fish who teaches Marlin (Nemo's dad) to live again after he has experienced much loss and tragedy.<br />Their travels bring them many places including a 12 step meeting for sharks (Hilarious, espescially if you are in recovery).
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This film and \\"The Dark Knight\\" have been the only two films that I have bothered to go see so far in 2008. This film is the better of the two. In spite of the fact that the characters are machines, this is a great love story between WALL-E, a trash collecting robot and EVE, a reconnaisance robot. As a reverse of the situation in modern film where we have humans acting like machines - if you call it acting - here we have machines acting human to the point we forget they are machines. In addition, we have a satirical look at the future that doesn't look that impossible or that far into the future, at least as far as the possible state of the earth or humankind is concerned.<br /><br />As usual with Pixar films, there is something for everyone. The adults can enjoy the love story and the sly social commentary, and the kids will enjoy the fun and adventure that is in every Pixar film. I thought Pixar had outdone itself with Ratatouille, but here they've pleasantly surprised me again.

B001EL6EHC|4.0|What is it that makes Casablanca just get better with time? Even though it was made as an obvious war-time morale booster at a time when America needed it, and these kinds of films were the most commonplace and most wanted kind of entertainment, this particular one turned out to be something very special. Bogart starred in several of these kinds of films, and [[ASIN:B000GIXLVQ Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Maltese Falcon Three-Disc Special Edition / Across the Pacific / Action in the North Atlantic / All Through the Night / Passage to Marseille)]] is full of them, yet I enjoy these films over and over. They are not just some dated WWII epics as so many films of that era come across today. So part of the attraction just has to be Bogart himself, the knowledge that nobody is that tough - yet Bogart pulls it off, and at the same time you can believe him capable of feeling the most intense romantic love possible. Or he can just use women and cast them aside - Bogie always keeps you guessing. Also, Casablanca is just about the most romantic film ever made. Finally, there are those wonderful supporting players - Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and the scene-stealing Claude Rains who claims to be shocked that there is gambling going on at Rick's Cafe Americain as he pockets his winnings.<br /><br />If you don't already own Casablanca, I feel it's an essential classic movie purchase, even if you're not really a classic movie fan. However, the only thing changing here versus the [[ASIN:B00009W0WM Casablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] is the artwork and the documentary on Jack Warner. My personal opinion is that, for the value, that is the better buy. Thus I arrived at my rating as follows:<br /><br />The film = 5 stars<br />The value of this edition = 3 stars<br />This averages to four stars.<br /><br />Warner Home Video has slowed down its release of classic films new to DVD this year and retreated to the safer territory of reissuing some of its sure-sellers. I hope that this is just a temporary decision based on the bad economy and not the beginning of a trend.is just a temporary decision based on the bad economy and not the beginning of a trend.
B000UJCALI|5.0|I'm French, and I had to buy this DVD from the US, since it includes 30 minutes that do not appear in the European version. Great film. Nicholson is as scary as can be. Great shots. Kubrick really captured the creepy atmosphere of the place.    Love it.
B000V86OKG|3.0|Dexter series 1 was a roller coaster ride every episode, with a plot that gave you just enough each week to keep you guessing and desperate for the next show.<br /><br />Season 2 just does not have this feel. You find Dexter becoming quite a bit more human; he's being thrown back and forth through little dramas to keep you interested. It comes off as a season either dedicated to shaping him for something really great, or preparing you for a family drama show to come..<br /><br />I'll wait and see if I buy the 3rd DVD set, kind of regret buying season 2 already.
0670018651|1.0|First, let me state clearly that I used to value Luca Turin's work, and I'm enthusiastic about \\"The secret of scent\\". It is his name which attracted my attention to this Guide.   Second, I did check authors' synopses on the back page. Dr. Turin holds a PhD in biophysics and writes about perfumes. For the little I know biophysics is not perfumery. Ms. Sanchez is an expert and avid perfume collector, writes on the Internet, lived in San Francisco and now in London. Now, how many prospective readers of this Guide don't collect perfumes, don't write on the Internet, didn't change a place of residence? OK, there is one difference - we don't claim to be experts.   Bemused by this preliminary finding I set out to explore the book. The faults I found are so many I will just enumerate them.   1) Text is uneven. Parts written by Turin (all text is initialed) flow easily, making for effortless reading. Sanchez's penmanship seems heavily indebted to tabloid prose, only it achieves higher level of sentence convolution. Copious references to \\"mom\\" and \\"dad\\" made me wonder if this book targets the adolescents.     2) Products selected for inclusion. A lot of these brands and fragrances is just noise. We either can't buy them in the USA, or they were shortly on the market and disappeared. What's the point of including these products, in particular since many are branded as either \\"disappointing\\" or \\"awful\\"?. (Though it does give an idea why some perfumes are not available this side of Atlantic.)   Remaining selections are either staple Sephora, or department store niche, say Creed or Annick Goutal.     3) Products not selected for inclusion. I looked for some the well-known names - Panthere de Cartier, Shiseido's Feminite du bois, Hermes' Rouge, Versace Blonde, Jardin du Nil MPG (do not confuse with Le Jardin sur le Nil by Hermes) - futilely. The whole brand of Molinard is dispensed with \\"cheap floral scents\\" and only Habanita merits the review. So-called niche is limited to few brands, as a rule available at department stores. Don't expect to find here any mention of DelRae, Nanadebarry, Christiane Gelle, Shalini or Fifi Chachnil of the frolicsome flacon. Not sure if the authors heard about Montale, MPG makes an appearance only once or twice. (Strangest of all, considering the taste exhibited in perfume rating - more below - they left out Avon.) Space does not allow me to list all what is missing.   At first I thought that the authors just pander to the interests of major department stores, but then checked again and yes, Trish McEvoy is also absent, so it's not department stores. Of course with the sheer number of perfumes on the market they had to make some exclusion choices, but what was the criteria? Perhaps product selection reflects the French/British market. Why, then, this book had been offered to the American public at all? Product selection should be adjusted to the local market.     4) Style of critique. Typical review is limited to up till three lines of qualifiers, intended to explain the fragrance's rating, which ranges from \\"masterpiece\\" to \\"awful\\". Any Internet-based retailer gives better \\"reviews\\" just by listing ingredients and comparable fragrances. This Guide is nothing better than a guide to personal tastes of the authors.     5) Tastes of the authors. Yes, they asked for it, by employing peculiar style of critique, see 4). Syrup, syrup ueber alles! True perfumery masterpiece sags under overload of vanilla and assorted kitchen odors, with generous hints at soiled underwear. Flowers, or rather \\"insect attractants\\", are deemed olfactorily inferior. Price is not a factor in rating, though price is said to reflect quality of ingredients; several affordable masterpieces may be found in the \\"personal care\\" section of your local food mart. Four labels - Guerlain, Estee Lauder, Chanel and Dior - dominate the field. Out of the three, two are owned by LVMH and only one has perfumes as its primary product. Given all this, I don't understand how the Authors could overlook Charlie!   The Authors never reveal their evaluation criteria.     6) Precision of execution. Sample case, Bulgari Black, which is rated \\"masterpiece\\" (did the Authors ever sniff the original Black, which reeked of burning rubber, and burning rubber alone? it wasn't pretty, but it was indeed outstanding in a very unappealing way. There is no mention of it in the review, while so many other scents come with history of all releases; current version of Black reeks of suburban mediocrity). The last sentence: \\"its place is with Bandit, Tabac Blond, and Cabochard among the great emancipated fragrances of all time\\". Now let's look at the ratings of the \\"great emancipated fragrances of all time\\". Bandit - a masterpiece; Tabac Blond - awful; Cabochard - disappointing. What did the Venerable Authors smell besides perfumes?     7) Presentation method. All products are listed alphabetically, followed by lists of \\"top ten\\" and all grade categories - masterpieces, recommended, disappointing, awful. Needless to say any such ranking functions only either as personal confession, or an attempt to influence prospective buyers. Judging by distribution of masterpieces across giant marketing firms we are dealing with the latter. That's why, perhaps, any absence of groupings and indexes based on the brand, creator, or the fragrance content.     On the positive note, I have absolutely no problem with the nasty tone of many reviews. Nasty wit can be wickedly funny and illuminating, though here it is neither, due to excess of clichés worn out by constant use in all texts on fashion, style and glamour. It doesn't matter anyhow, since the Guide totally fails in its purported mission. It is just another boring oeuvre on \\"style\\" (yes, \\"style\\" and not style), intended by its creator as a money-maker and directed at the newbies. Newbies are always numerous and impressionable, so it is rather easy to get them enthusiastic about - and spending on - anything.Footnote: I did not buy this book, in spite of previous positive experience with one of the authors. Decided to borrow it first and check. And the verdict is: I will not buy this book and will not bother with any consecutive editions. Better to spend on some perfume not listed in this guide.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This is the best season so far. This time, the episodes move from the present moment to a future one, and back again to the present (previous seasons moved from the present moment to the past). Even though future events are known, in no way does this remove the element of surprise and suspense. The script is very well written and the episodes very entertaining and unpredictable. The acting is top-notch, and you'll find yourself watching one episode after the other. Not such a bad form of addiction after all! No one will be rushing you to the nearest rehab center any time soon!     This season tries to explain many riddles, such as the famous button to push on the hour, the strange numbers, the black smoke, the polar bear, Jacob, the powers of the island, etc... However, don't expect all the answers revealed. You'll still find yourself guessing.     To really enjoy this season, I recommend you start-off with season 1 through 3. If you have not watched previous seasons, you'll be at a loss, and you probably won't enjoy this series.     I watched this season as a download from iTunes. This is the first TV series I download. I watched this series on a Sony Bravia HD TV. The picture and audio were very clear. I found no difference in terms of picture and audio quality between the download and DVD discs. In fact, the download works better for me: I don't have to wait for the DVD discs to arrive in the mail, and I don't pay any shipping charges or extra taxes. Living abroad, the cost of the series gets to be much less! I also noticed that season 4 is still on pre-order on amazon.com. For those who can't wait to watch this series I highly recommend you considering legally downloading the episodes. Downloading also preserves the environment since you won't need all the packaging. Another possible advantage to downloading is that in ten years from now you will probably be able to convert the episodes to the future format by a simple computer software. How many of you still have VHS movies? Are you able to easily and cost-effectively convert them into a computer format without expensive hardware? Having movies on your computer will be much easier to convert to the future format, and they won't take any space on your shelves!    The season ends with a very unexpected event, and I am really looking forward to season 5.
B000CNE092|4.0|This was a great movie for my 5 year old granddaughter.  She loves anything with princesses and the color was beautiful.  Great value with the added bonus of the 2nd disk.  She will pass it to her baby sister when the time is right.
B0010V4TSW|3.0|For me this album is OK. But why bands lose \\"power\\" after several cds? are they using \\"quality\\" instead \\"power\\"?. Face the emptiness, New Religion and Sign of fear are very good songs.... nevertheless, the rest of the album could be powerless.... you can feel a long \\"balad\\" among the cd while listening..... which is booooring¡¡¡¡¡ but with quality.  Well, when I'm listening to this album, after 5 songs I change to Nuclear Fire.
0385504217|5.0|A great and easy read that keeps you reading.  I have never read a book that I actually had the problem of putting it down, but The Da Vinci Code keeps you hooked.  Dan Brown strikes gold in this edge of your...fingertips instead of seat i suppose.  And if you liked this book, you'll LOVE the prequel to it, \\"Angels and Demons\\" by Dan Brown.
0321200683|5.0|I used this book on a recent consulting engagement and found it to be extremely useful. The authors discuss topics in depth then identify patterns in that area.    As an experienced Architect, one of the challenges I find in discussing solutions at a design level is the tendency of people to speak in implementation terms. This skews the design and makes it difficult to connect the solution with the business goals.    Hohpe & Woolfe's book provides an informative and practical language to creating flexible integration architecture.
0143038419|5.0|This is a great book. It is brilliantly written, very funny, and thought provoking. I highly recommend it!
B00005JMK0|5.0|This is one of the greatest 80's movies ever.  A fun love story with a twist.  This film had some of the best music ever put on a soundtrack.  It is a shame this movie hasn't been transferred to DVD yet.  Get on the ball guys...put this on DVD!
0307455874|5.0|For anyone who has been following Obama's campaign, reading The Audacity of Hope will dispel once and for all any notion of his insincerity, being \\"too good to be true\\", or flip-flopping--all of which have been thrown out at us as discouraging comments.  Throughout  his book, written before he tossed his hat in the ring, one witnesses his most deeply held values.  The wondrous part  is  that they are perfectly consistent with the values he has been espousing on the campaign trail.  This takes one by surprise, given the fact that he is campaigning for a political office.  After reading his book, one can readily believe that his having to counter McCain's  style of campaigning must be gut-wrenching for Obama.  Mud-slinging is totally unlike, and against, the very fabric of his being.     His book--beautifully written by him, not a ghost writer--also demonstrates the depth of his vision and coherence of all he sees.  These are rare traits in someone of his age.  He takes us on a tour of Congress, of politics, of his mind, and other topics, reflecting all the way on his assessment of what is happening and his response to it.  This gives the reader a behind-the-scenes picture of how he would most likely approach the Presidency.      Lastly, his book shows the care and attention he gives to others'  ideas--even those of Republicans.  He truly respects all persons, valuing them just for being other human beings like himself.  Because he listens, hears, and values what others have to say, the gnawing feeling one may have about his lack of experience  becomes assuaged.  He may not have had the on-the-job training that unquestionably would be useful as President, but he is clearly bright enough to surround himself with those who do have the needed experience. More importantly, he shows no signs of egocentricity, giving him the capacity to take others' advice, filter it through his brilliant and well-ordered mind, and come out with his own, value-based decisions.  It makes onethink, \\"I could be proud to have that kind of President.\\"
0385040253|5.0|Hands down, if you're into knots, rope work, sailing, etc...this is definitely a book to add to your shelf.  Over 600 pages, it's got pretty much references to every knot you could think of, as well as a good history on rope and knots, and a great index to quickly find what you need.  I've even found most other books or online resources I look at reference the \\"Ashley Book of Knots\\" number (ABOK#) when they're describing what to do.  All in all a good investment.
B00000F14B|3.0|I was not happy with the quality of this dvd. The duet between Shirley Jones and the barber shop quartet was a HUGH disappointment. You can only here the barber shop quartet singing and Shirley Jones voice is silent and only her lips move. This is one of the better songs in the movie and I was upset needless to say. I will think twice before buying from this setter again. Maybe I should have realized that a cheaper price does not insure a quality product.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|It's been a long time that someone has all the elements of greatness when it comes to a male singer.  Michael has these elements in spades.  A lovely voice with a full range, incredible control and phrasing, and that special building of anticipation that the greats have, fill this musical collection of older and more modern music.  The musicians are also wonderful and conducted superbly well.
0743454537|5.0|Wow best book I have ever read. The characters are interesting the plot is compelling ad the plot has a nasty turn at the end. I would rate this billions of stars if i could. Im 15 and this book made me BAWL. I loved it it has scientific and medical aspects, lovey dovey aspects, and touches upon things like the fragile mother daughter relationship and the big choice a daughter must make. READ IT!
B000I2JKCO|5.0|\\"The Polar Express\\" is based on the classic picture book by Chris Van Allsburg, and brought to the screen through the magic of computer animation. The movie is a huge spectacle of wondrous imagery. All this surrounds the story of a skeptical young boy who takes a Christmas Eve ride on the Polar Express, in attempt to convince himself that Santa Claus is real. Tom Hanks is the star, providing the performance of several characters, including the stoic Conductor, who plays it strict in one instance, then endearing in the next. Much has been made of the liberties taken with the original story. This is just a case of having to stretch a simple story into feature length. But a lot of added sequences are enjoyable and breathtaking, including the snappy \\"Hot Chocolate\\" number. You can expect this to be a new holiday classic that will be remembered for years!
B000YAX3P0|5.0|Amy Winehouse is one of my favorite artists.  This album is great.  Let's hope she is around for years to come.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|I am addicted to this album, I love it!!! The best album to come around in a long time. She draws comparisons to Amy Winehouse & Duffy but to me Adele stands above them, on her own. Tired has an upbeat tap your feet groove and Hometown Glory mesmerizes. The whole album is great from start to finish. Love to Love Adele & 19!!
1401300529|3.0|I thought that this book would've earned 5 stars but I was disappointed.  The research was outstanding, but little was done to help readers make their way through the text.  Often times battles and territory were described without maps; other times, the maps seemed inadequate.  The editor of this book should do better next time. Imagine your reader getting through the text for the first time....think, what might help him grasp this better?   Also, there was no explanation of the difference between US troops and UN troops. Finally, photos would have enriched the text, but I would guess they were left out because of the bottom line.
B0017MO10U|5.0|This last Stargate SG-1 drama is a very satisfying dramatic conclusion to the long running Stargate series.  As a family, we've been Stargate fans since its inception.  We really enjoyed this last great excellent effort by the  SG-1 team to save the world and the galaxy just one more time!
0143038583|5.0|This is a non-fiction account of the history behind the food we eat. This book describes the great industrial food complex and advocates local, organic foods. Extremely well-researched and well-presented. This was a compelling book and will likely convince you to change your eating habits.
B00001PE4D|4.0|I was 14 years old when Cruel Intentions came out, and to my middle-school sensibilities it was absolutely the sexiest, most dramatic, decadent movie I could imagine. Of course now, I can see it for what it is, but I don't really enjoy it any less. Cruel Intentions updates the story of Dangerous Liaisons into a modern Manhattan prep school, and the story translates remarkably well. The youthful cast acquit themselves remarkably well, hitting just the right notes of entitlement and self-doubt. The story is melodramatic, but sharply written, not too long and with just enough mocking self-awareness to keep from being to ridiculousely serious. Cruel Intentions is a teen movie that teeters on the edge of eroticism (i.e. a remarkably chaste lesbian kiss), allowing its target audience to emulate the characters in the way that matters most; by allowing them to play at being grown-ups, while never losing sight of their true immaturity and inexperience.
031606792X|3.0|I highly anticipated this release, it just wasn't worth the wait.  What in the heck happened to her characters??  Edward was a whiny mess. I adored him in the other books, this one not so much. And I just couldn't wrap my head around the whole (spoilers, sorry) emergeny c section in the house thing.  Eclipse was far far better book, sorry.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Do not purchase products from this supplier.  I received a copy of the CD, did not come in a CD case or with album information.  I received a plain CD with the songs copied onto it, they didn't even enter the title names. I was offered a refund, but I've seen nothing 2 months later.
044661758X|5.0|If you liked The Black Echo, don't miss this book!<br /><br />Only Michael Connelly would dream up a story where a beleaguered police detective being sued for use of excessive force would spend every hour outside of the trial tracking down a serial killer.  The Concrete Blonde picks up on the back story behind the first book in the series, The Black Echo, in which Harry Bosch it is reported that Bosch had been previously demoted from the elite Robbery-Homicide Division to the Hollywood Division's homicide squad for not having followed the procedure of calling for a back up before shooting and killing a serial murder suspect while the suspect was reaching for his toupee. The Concrete Blonde opens with the scene in which Bosch shot the suspect.<br /><br />The City of Los Angeles and Harry are being sued by the widow of Norman Church, the man Bosch killed. The widow has a tough attorney and Bosch has a stumble bum from the city attorney's office. The case seeks to exonerate Church from having killed anyone. But Bosch knows better. The evidence pointed to Church being the Dollmaker, a serial killer who applied extensive make up to the victims.<br /><br />During the trial a shock arrives. Another dead body is found that looks like it has been killed by the Dollmaker . . . but the body is fresher than Church's death. Does this mean that Church wasn't the Dollmaker . . . or is there some, more sinister, explanation?<br /><br />While Bosch is defending himself in court, another deadly game is being played behind the scenes. Who will win?<br /><br />For me, The Concrete Blonde nicely captured the strengths of The Black Echo that made that book such a remarkable detective story that introduced this outstanding series. I was glad to see Mr. Connelly return the series to its excellent roots.<br /><br />Have a ball!
B0015DYIH2|2.0|Ok so i'm not going to bash Breaking Dawn like a lot of people did.  i agree that it wasn't the best book in the series but it was entertaining and well written.  some of the author's plots were a little predictible and packaged a little too pretty but oh well...it's a young adult novel for pete's sake.    my main complaint about the book is simply that there wasn't any fighting.  yes, there's more to my complaint than lack of violence but i expected there to be SOME fighting somewhere.  mostly it was arguing and internal struggle or some crap like that.  i was hoping for a fight with the volturi.  i didn't want to see everyone die but with the great fight scenes from previous books, i was hoping for something.  the whole \\"Nessie\\" thing was a little annoying but sure...she had to come up with some way to keep Jacob around and to get the volturi to come back so i'll let that slide.    i think Stephanie Meyer was trying to rush a bit too much to get this book out (i was grateful though cuz i was curious as to how she'd end it) that she didn't take the time to get a really good plot and really good ideas.  kinda seemed like she settled for easy vs good.    overall, i enjoyed the book...mostly.  and i'm looking forward to the movie (and maybe more than one).  but i think she missed the mark with Breaking Dawn...BIG TIME!
0679745203|4.0|Ondaatje's prose is lyrical and poetic.  More than anything, Ondaatje creates an atmoshpere that is as much a presence in this book than any single character.  The story delves into the lives of four people living in a war-damaged Italian monastery as World War II ends. Hana, a nurse, attempts to nurse the English patient back to life.  Caravaggio, Hana's childhood friend, and Kip, a skillful bomb difuser, make up the rest of the cast of characters.  Beautifully and evocatively written but slow at times.
0345350499|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. I bought this copy as a gift for a friend. Nearly every literate person has heard the tales of Camelot and King Arthur. This classic novel expertly focuses on the women's perspective. I've read it several times and find insights into the origin of legends and religions, especially the feminine aspects of the Divine. If you enjoy it, I highly recommend the prequels, The Forest House and Priestess of Avalon.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|'Remember that Night' might be billed as David Gilmour, but it comes off better than the Pulse DVD which is actually Pink Floyd - in name anyway if not in total execution (Roger Waters absence will always make it seem less than authentic and legitimate).  Gilmour and fellow Floyd Richard Wright do very spirited versions of the old classics, and there's \\"Fat Old Sun\\" which Pink Floyd hasn't done since Atom Heart Mother days, a very welcome deep cut and great version.  Being that it's Gilmour and not Floyd, there isn't nearly the spectacle and stage-show that Pink Floyd is associated with - so hearing the old Floyd numbers in what is a solo Gilmour context with Wright, and other Floyd-related musicians is a treat.  Would be nice if Gilmour did any solo material besides the entire 'On an Island' disc, but that's a small point of contention, not one to pass up 'Remember that Night' if one is a die-hard Pink Floyd fan.  Or David Bowie fan (who guests on \\"Comfortably Numb\\") or a Crosby, Stills & Nash fan (on this DVD is the only place to see \\"Crosby, Gils & Nash\\" do a most moving rendition of \\"Find the Cost of Freedom\\", worth the DVD price alone)
B000BF0D9M|4.0|Jesse is simply awesome.   Can't really get too much of him, but for some reason I can't stand track 13 Toca Orilla.  Must be me.  This is a 2cd set so one bad song out of 26 isn't bad hey?
B00003JRCQ|5.0|It's the best screen version for this splendorous novel! After having seen it, try to read the book again - I promise: you'll see in your mind all the scenes again! The dialogues are almost the same you've read in the book. There were almost no changings from the book to the screen- a good and very careful direction, I suppose.   And Captain Wentworth ...  God! ... the look in his eyes when he sees Anne made me shake inside!   I really, really loved it!
0156421178|5.0|Homage to Catalonia is Orwell at the zenith of his journalistic style--brutally candid in its description of the battlefield and the politics of the Spanish Civil War in which he participated as a volunteer foot soldier against the military insurgency.  The Civil War was, of course, a prelude to WWII and while this is clearly adumbrated in Orwell's vivd descriptions of the antagonists, he could not have anticipated the future conflagration.  It is a \\"must read\\" not only for those interested in the politics of the conflict but also for anyone desiring a candid insight into the plight of the combatants.
0321544080|3.0|I have never been as disappointed with a book as I am with this one.  I still gave it 3 stars because the book was not absolute crap, it was still an OK book.  It is from the great Joe McNally, with many of his photos and tips and tricks from him and people who influenced him.  That is a crappy way to write a book, basically it would make a great web page, but a crappy book.<br /><br />I have been a fan for a long time, Joe McNally has been an icon in the photo world, but the shots he used to illustrate his points in the this book were not his best, not his second best, they were not even good most of the time.  He seems to think so, which makes me question his judgment, but I think most of them suck and the stories that go with them are trite and often times do not give you any helpful/useful info so that you can recreate a similar shot.  What kind of advice is that?  I liked some of the stories, but even then they were too short on substance and detail, often times more about him or the situation than the photo.<br /><br />This book is basically a poorly thought out combination between a coffee table book full of pictures (none of which would I put in a coffee table book btw) and a Scott Kelby-esque guide.  The problem is that it is not Kelby-esque at all, it just uses his \\"friends chit chatting and lending advice\\" style (and not very well either).<br /><br />I am no pro, I am no critic, I am for all intents and purposes no one that Joe McNally has to impress or care about.  I am a regular guy who paid too much for a book.  I lost a lot of respect for McNally, much of which I would likely have lost if I would have simply seen many of these photos in the first place, some were that forgettable.<br /><br />I feel ripped off, but only because of my high expectations.  I was lead to believe from Scott Kelby that this was a great book, he is biased.  I am going to have to start taking his advice with a grain of salt, knowing that I have to say that this is the only time he has done me wrong.<br /><br />A note to Joe, please do us all a favor and make another book, this time do it right, use your \\"A\\" material, write a book that is EITHER a showcase for your work OR a guide to help us little guys become better at lighting/photography in general.e to Joe, please do us all a favor and make another book, this time do it right, use your \\"A\\" material, write a book that is EITHER a showcase for your work OR a guide to help us little guys become better at lighting/photography in general.
6304698682|3.0|This is the least of Clint Eastwood's Western films.  That is not to say that it's bad.  It has a lot of good in it.  It has great scenery (it was shot on location in Idaho by the great Bruce Surtees), and it has a genuine rustic feel to it.  It feels very real.  It has excellent performances, with kudos going to Michael Moriarty, who gives the best performance here as a \\"leader\\" of the miners, and Richard Dysart as a mining boss who wants to wipe out the settlers who are trying to find their own gold.  It's beautifully shot (the interior scenes and night scenes are expertly done), but thematically, there's something missing here.  Clint's character is just called Preacher, and it feels like a tamer version of Clint's Western masterpiece, High Plains Drifter.  It feels like there are supernatural elements here, but you're not sure whether it's intentional, ambiguous, or just plain sloppiness.  Even the final confrontation seems contrived.  The film feels unfinished, like it's really not sure of itself, and the effect is disconcerting.  It's one of the few Clint Eastwood films that has a very noticeable uneveness to it.<br /><br />This is not a disaster, but it's not one of Clint's better pictures.  It's worth viewing once or twice, mainly for the beautiful location photography and some good performances.
B001BGTWXI|4.0|When a band manages to survive for a decade and more, it's because they're willing to stretch out into new territory and keep their sound fresh. As usual, Slipknot is plagued by so-called fans complaining about how the band doesn't sound exactly like it did on albums from at least seven years ago. Well if you want musicians to keep on sounding exactly the same album after album, listen to Country Pop or Lite Jazz and see how long your interest holds up. Slipknot is definitely evolving as a band, and that's what serious veteran musicians do. So this album should be judged not because it's a bit different than their earlier works, but on whether its musical statements are successful. Here's where the rubber mask meets the road for Slipknot.<br /><br />The side projects, especially Stone Sour, have obviously added variety and maturity to the Slipknot sound. \\"Gematria (The Killing Name)\\" is probably their most intricate and solidly written track yet, and things get really interesting in \\"Wherein Lies Continue\\" which slows down the attack to the pace of rumbling hardcore and increases Slipknot's heaviness far beyond the standard bashing and screaming that nu-fans think is true metal. Meanwhile, the Slipknot percussion army - the true source of the band's uniqueness - works up some of their swinginest grooves ever in \\"Sulphur\\" and \\"Psychosocial.\\" The only real trouble on this album comes with the power ballads \\"Dead Memories\\" and \\"Snuff,\\" which are reasonable tries at maturity but end up sounding like Nickelback and other meatheads, and an attempt at Korn-ish atmosphere in \\"Gehenna\\" is a major misstep. Overall, everybody in the band other than the percussion army is still plagued by a lack of true personality and uniqueness in their performances. #0 and #5 are ridiculously underutilized in the band's total sound, though #8's lyrics and mannerisms are getting better.<br /><br />While not all of Slipknot's current advancements work, at least they've got the will to develop and improve. That's worthy of respect from fans, even those who refuse to live in the present. [~dooomsdayer520~]at's worthy of respect from fans, even those who refuse to live in the present. [~dooomsdayer520~]
B000069HJI|4.0|Supertramp have nearly always delivered the goods with their unique style of music, some albums fantastic, the others probably just good. This one sits in the good category but their music is always thoughtful and doesn't change too much, so this CD will round out your collection.  The later albums without Roger Hodgson are still pretty good but in my opinion just lack a bit of spark of earlier efforts.  Worth getting.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I have viewed Oh Brother Where Art Thou several times. It is very funny, has great music, and keeps me laughing for hours, if not days. All the characters are great and believable.  We love this video at my house.
B000M341QO|5.0|I could not stop watching this movie and was stunned that it seemed to end so soon.  The realism of the gory \\"shoot-em-up\\" scenes was astounding! Great story line and the ending was somewhat different than I'd expected.  Overall excellent film.
B0009MAO46|5.0|This is a great movie!!!  My daughter absolutely loves it...we bought this one to donate to our local library because they are trying to convert their vhs collection to dvd's, but it's expensive.  We thought we could donate a movie for them so my daughter chose which movie she wanted to donate.
B00078XGRO|4.0|This is by far the best of the Next Generation Star Trek films and probably second only to 'Star Trek IV The Voyage Home' in terms of all the Star Trek films. Its almost a direct continuation of the TNG episodes \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" in which Jean Luc Picard is assimalated by the Borg.<br /><br />The story has been told by many other reviewers, so I will not repeat that. However, I will say that here you get an excellent story, which is well directed by Jonathan Frakes, and above all a marvellous leading performance by Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean Luc Picard.<br /><br />The 2nd disc contains hours and hours of extras which are well worth watching. You can see from the interviews on the extras disc the enthusiasm of all those involved in the making of the film.<br /><br />All the things that make, or have made, Star Trek such a long-standing success are contained in this film: The marvellous interaction of the characters and cast with each other. Decisions that affect the future of humanity, a moral quality which may ultimately be the way forward for us all, and as with all the best Star Trek films and TV shows time travel.<br /><br />Of course I realise that 'a moral quality' sounds horribly pretentious, and in reality this is just a film that will have no affect on mankinds future (or lack of it). So forget about that and watch a cracking film.
B000001FDK|5.0|This brings back my childhood!  Why can't today's music be as melodic and fun to sing?  Awesome soundtrack - one of the best!
B0013FBS20|4.0|I enjoyed sound quality and the big band sound was outstanding, ole blue eyes wasn't bad either.
B001B71NOI|3.0|I enjoyed and continue to enjoy this album.  Sounds much different from most of Trent's other stuff.  Maybe most like \\"With Teeth\\".  The first four songs (1,000,000, Letting You, Discipline, and Echoplex) are really good.  Head Down is OK.  The album then tapers off and finally finishes with \\"Demon Seed\\", another good rocking song.  I thought this was a better album than \\"Year Zero\\"; I'm finding that I listen to this album quite a bit more than \\"Year Zero\\".  Can't beat getting a trial listen of the entire album for free via the Creative Commons licensing and free download of the songs.  Very shrewd on Trent's part to build hype around the album.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Thank you for getting this movie to me so quickly and in the shape that was described!
B0017WCG48|2.0|I've bought the Master of puppets lp from amazon.  The package skould be changed so if you buy one lp it sholud be snuggly fitted inside the package not as this one was, falling around in a big box.  But when it comes to the record itself i find that MoFi has done a little poor job when mixing up the record. This can also be said with kill en all and ride the lightning that the tweeter is much to high. The record sounds great but the tweeter levels are just to damn loud it cuts to the ears and sounds really bad after a while.    Damn you MoFi...
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Slipknot really did it this time, this is a great solid effort. Yes it is true is not what we expected but that doesn't mean it's bad at all!!  They want to milk the cow and make gazillion dollars (which they probably will) with this album, singles & tour and we can't blame them for that, we're all working to get there. For me, this'll be their swan song and they'll be retiring with a very good note, at their peak, as it should always be.
B0000640VM|5.0|Just to put this all in context...i was 5 years old, living on Long Island NY (where Billy Joel is from) and this movie was absolute magic to me. Maybe it was because it was set in New York City, maybe it was because Billy Joel (a hometown hero) was the voice of one of the main characters and sang a great song. Who knows. All i know is that me and my sister begged my father to see it again as soon as it was finished and he gave in (which was unusual for him). So pretty much this movie is like chistmas morning as a child to me.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I am 35, and I have been an AC-DC fan for 25 years ever since I borrowed my brother's cassette for Back in Black, this DVD has most of the best of the band and in a Live stage in front of a huge crowd which adds up to the extra addrenalin boost you are going to receive when purchasing this DVD.  Panoramic scenes and takes, light show but best of all the performance and sound are very good for this production.  I could be watching this DVD everyday, actually I do.  This is what I wake up daily to and you should to.  The whole band still rock like always.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This is the second movie CD soundtrack that I've ever purchased, and without a doubt the best representation of ABBA's music.  Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried have the most beautiful voices and deliver the lyrics with appropriate emotional expression.  I love every song on this CD and that's a first for me!!!
B00003CXA6|1.0|This DVD was horrible quality.  It looked like a pirated dvd.  Very difficult to watch.
031606792X|3.0|I thought Stephanie Meyer did an excellent job writing the wedding and the honeymoon.  It was very romantic, yet tasteful and drew me completely into the book.  I also loved how she did the pregnancy from Jacob's perspective. I wondered how Edward would eventually turn Bella into a vampire.  I thought it was perfect how he turned her just after she had given birth.  I laughed when she beat Emmett in arm wrestling but the whole Volutri situation disappointed in the end.  Stephanie builds up this intense climax with the Volutri coming and then nothing happens.  they just walk away.  I was hoping after Bella displayed her powers there would be a battle.  Plus I thought Jacob imprinting on \\"Nessie\\"  was too much.  I rolled my eyes when I read that.  I was hoping he would have become closer to Leah. I did like how she was finally able to let Edward into her mind.  It was pretty good but not as good as the first three.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|This album is other worldly. I've loved this album for a long time and once i tripped HARD while listening to it. It was pretty intense (..totally bro...haha....ehem..). Moonlight Drive seemed to last for half an hour and the entire room moved to the beat/rhythm of the music but i'm sure most people don't care about such things...i digress. This is great psychedelic music (drugs or no drugs) and probably the weirdest Doors album.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|It has perfromed as advertized.  Software was easy to install and the GPS position showed quickly includeing DGPS.  I've been using it for about a month with Nobeltec 8.2 on a laptop and am very pleased with the results.

B00005JPO1|3.0|So its almost been...twenty years since the last Indiana Jones movie and after all that time, a fourth film has finally been done, with Speilberg, Ford, and Lucas all re-teaming up again for a new adventure with everyone's favorite archeoligist.<br /><br />From the very beginning, things start going. We find an older Indy being taken captive by a group of Soviets, led by the bobbed Cate Blanchett, using him to find a treasure hidden within the confines of the mysterious Area 51, which turns out to be that of a crystal skull that hold mysterious powers. After that, Indy finds himself on another quest, in tow a young greaser named Mutt (LeBeouf) and the return of Marion Ravenwood from the first film, as the three set out to find the mysterious lost kingdom where the skull came from, all the while sidestepping the Soviets advance.<br /><br />To put it all in a nutshell, Indy 4 is basically just a good ole dose of nostalgia for all those whole grew up with the beloved series. But that aside, the film is pretty weak compared to the original three, in both spirit and concept. Where the first films were all witty and original, with genuine stunts and thrilling chases, this Indy has suddenly taken on a very glossy effect and we find a lot of the characters pretty hallow in comparision to the other films.<br /><br />One big problem with the film is the plot in general. The whole idea of aliens, mayan temples, mind control, to put it as one reviewer said, it starts to cross over into X-Files territory, which seems to completly dislocate the whole movie from its beginnings. This also happens to be the first film of the whole series where effects seemed to have taken over from the general idea of the whole films, and thats the shear fun of it all. With all that said, the film just does not make an impression, which is really quite sad. Its like, Speilberg and Lucas had all this time and this is really the best they could come up with?<br /><br />Indy 4 will definantly please all hardcore fans, who will gladly welcome back the archeoligist with open arms. Other then that, this film really has nothing else to offer and may be a sign that Indy should hang the fedora up once and for all.welcome back the archeoligist with open arms. Other then that, this film really has nothing else to offer and may be a sign that Indy should hang the fedora up once and for all.
B0009MAO46|1.0|This has to be the greatest kids all-time story, especially for young Boys. Which small boy has never imagined that his toys are real and come alive? Technically this is the film that revolutionized animation. It also brought animation from the \\"cutie-cutie\\", good always beats evil of Disney, introducing a more up-to-date cynicism, slightly dark & gray material, such as the kid Sid and even our hero Woody - though the latter is the main subject matter in that he is attempting to redeem himself. The characters are rich, three dimensional(Most are - except for most humans which is quite ironic and charming) Future generations will love these characters and they will endure forever. Toy Story 2 unashamedly attempts to bring the girls into the action with the lively girl-cowboy character Jessie, and while it is also very successful it just never reaches the freshness found in the original TOY STORY.
031606792X|2.0|My 21 year old daughter bought me the entire set of books.  She is enamored with Edward.  I understand.  He's a very compelling character - he's beautiful, perfect, brilliant, protective, inhumanely strong and agile, enigmatic, the ultimate bad-boy with a heart of gold, and he has an amazing backstory and an inhumanly beautiful, loyal and loving adopted family.  I get it - he's every adolescent girl's dream.  And wonder of wonders, he never ages.  The series is more or less about the inexplicable attraction of soul mates, inexplicable because I cannot for the life of me figure out what makes Bella attractive aside from the fact that Edward can't read her mind and she smells enticing.      Perhaps it's my age, but I believe three things - the first is regarding a work of fantasy - an author must stay true to his or her fantasy.  You cannot break the your own rules to give the reader what you think the reader wants.  A fantasy is exactly that, make-believe...a dream, but even so, as a writer you must stay true to the rules you establish for your own fantasy.  Ms. Meyer breaks her own rules.    Second, characters must develop and mature.  There must be a larger reason for events in a story and that larger reason cannot simply be so the hero can constantly save the heroine - which is the case here.  It gets very old.  Bella does not change and grow.  From beginning to end she remains the same apathetic, cynical, whiny, helpless, martyred female she was when she arrived in Forks.  Except when she's with Edward and then she superglues herself to his side in a manner that seems much more like the way a drug addict needs a fix than true love.  She gets her happy ending but I'm left wondering what she will do with it.  Anything redeeming?  I very much doubt it.    Third, I want my characters fleshed out.  In my opinion, Jacob was the most three-dimensional character in the entire series and at times he was written in such a way that he became almost repellent to me.  Throughout all four books, the same superficial descriptive words, the same sappy love-sick-puppy feelings that are supposed to pass for mature, timeless love, the same scenes are repeated ad nauseam.  I would have liked to see the Cullens, other than Carlisle, do more with the their eternal existence than simply repeating experiences and 'hunting'.  Oh, and saving Bella for some unknown reason.  I assume they became attached to Bella because they loved Edward and he loved her, so as Laurent said to Bella in the second book - she was kind of a pet of theirs.  I expect more from my female leads. Through four books I wanted Bella to mature, to become more 'human' than she was when the series began.  But I'm sorry to say she never did.  Edward always seemed more human and more compassionate to me and his character was diminished as the series went on.      If you can get past the flawed writing, the concept works, especially in the first book.  Other than Jacob Black, I was disappointed with the remainder of the story.  Vampire world ain't all that exciting.  From what I could tell, their larger society consisted of a bunch of overgrown, temper-tantrum prone, immature, super-powered children (I'm including the ancient vampires with the papery skin) who murder a lot of people.  Their rules are simple - keep the secret.  That's it folks.   Would it be too much to expect that after living for millennia these vampires might develop some special perspective or philosophy greater  than - we don't eat the neighbors?    Okay, rant finished.
B0017XOF5A|5.0|The movie was fantastic...I hope they continue making more or continue the series...now this would be nice to see Amanda Tapping, Richard Dean Anderson, Christopher Judge, Michael Shanks, Beau Bridges & Claudia Black. I think that they could make a movie involving Atlantis and SGC. I hope that this will show will continue and the Producers and Writers will never Give UP!!
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Portishead is back with an album that is well worth the wait. Truly unique music as I haven't heard in years. One listen to \\"The Rip\\" should  convince you. Highly recommended.
1400095204|4.0|Resonating against the backdrop of current-day events in The Sudan is remarkable young author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's engrossing story set during the brief history of Biafra, a breakaway area of Nigeria that had a short, bloody existence as a nation during the 1960s.  In the post-colonial era when many new African nations were born, many native Nigerians saw their new government as little more than a black version of their white European oppressors.  Achidie's lead character, Professor Odenigbo, an ethnic Igbo, lives comfortably, to the extent that he can hire a houseboy, 13-year-old Ugwu. These two main characters provide the adult, academic and child's-eye, non-academic view of both revolutionary rhetoric and action.<br /><br />Adichie's story of revolution is also a family story as Odenigbo's beautiful girlfriend Olanna, her twin sister Kainene, and her boyfriend, white author/journalist Richard become involved.  Peripheral characters also play an important role in the interpersonal plot development.  Adichie does a wonderful job describing the lives of various classes in Nigerian society - haves, middle-class and the dirt poor inhabitants of refugee camps.  For me, she struck her only wrong note with a series of chapter summaries from a book being written by Richard.  I felt that these could have been expanded to real chapters or left out.  \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" refers literally to the design of Biafra's national flag.  Ironically it also represents the reality of this small country, on which the sun never truly rose.<br /><br />Highly recommended to readers of historical fiction, and to those who want to learn more about life in Africa.  Four strong stars.

B000O5B4C4|5.0|BASIC INSTINCT is a masterpiece of human behavior and frailty that could never be made now in these days of extreme political correctness.  It pulls no punches in portraying the characters in harsh reality, without remorse or apologies for their flaws.    After viewing the movie through once, I went back to the \\"Extras\\" and turned on the commentary by the psychologist.  Her observations were spellbinding, and I found myself watching the entire movie again.  I highly recommend her commentary for anyone seeking a deeper understanding and appreciation for this cinematic classic.    The Blu-ray version was superb!
160459201X|4.0|Joseph Murphy has a wonderfully easy way of conveying information in his writings. I feel that he is to the point in making everything understandable. In The Power of the Subconscious Mind, he brings to light how our thoughts make our life experience what it is. What we believe, we achieve, whether negative or positive. We attract to us what we send out to the Universe. So, if we don't like how our lives are going, we must change our thoughts to correspond with what we want instead. Easy to read, easy to apply. I read this book many years ago and have proven over and over how to apply its teachings. I lost my copy and purchased a new one so that I could re-read it. I am a spiritual counselor and his teachings are wonderful to use in helping others to over come their situations. I have given this book to several people, who have discovered a new way of thinking, thus a better way of living.

B00007KQA3|5.0|Michael Radford's adaptation of the well-known novel by Orwell is very faithful to its source material and very impressive. The cast is perfect in its leading trio: John Hurt as Winston Smith, Suzanna Hamilton as Julia and last but certainly not least in his last movie performance Richard Burton as O'Brien.     Orwell's dystopian vision of the future will be well known to most of us.   Winston Smith, the central character, lives in a totalitarian world, in which all pay homage to the ominous ever present \\"Big Brother\\" and, To sort of keep birth rates at an acceptable level, war is continually waged against some kind of enemy, that seems to change as much as wind direction whatever the fear mongers deem appropriate.     Inhabitants of this world are continually bombarded with propaganda through a kind of two-way TV screens that are present in both the private as well as the public domain. The screens also serve as a way of keeping continuous watch on people as it is forbidden to switch them off     Through the destruction of any sense of history and knowledge that might be identity reinforcing, the masses are being \\"educated\\" into being mindless canon fodder.     Love, never mind sex, is forbidden, as it sabotages the goal mentioned above and aside from that all that penned up sexual frustration can be used as a reservoir to tap into and turn into boundless aggression and almost erotic admiration for \\"Big Brother\\".     In this mob Winston is consumed and invisible, until he meets Julia and they start an affair, half out of love, half as an act of rebellion against the state. However, from the outside they know their eventual fate and admit to each other \\"We are the Dead\\".     The third figure O'Brien comes into the picture when Smith and Julia want to contact a supposed underground resistance movement and they contact him as being a key figure in it. The truth is both shocking and revealing.     Contrary to what some people think, the book was not meant as a criticism of communism per se, but against any form of dictatorship, there are plenty of comments made by Orwell on this subject.     The movie does a wonderful job in bringing not so much uplifting as shockingly hypnotic and intriguing story to life. Orwell envisioned as a location a post-WWII London and Radford very much stayed true to this idea. His city quite obviously is in decay and full of ruins shown in murky colors like WW II archive documentary images. The cinematography is wonderful.     John Hurt is perfect as the worn out Winston Smith being in a state of hopeless and irreversible decay.   Burton as O'Brien is equally unforgettable and merciless; his eyes that offer nothing but the hopelessness of self-awareness, the realization of the insignificance of the individual being grinded down under the boot of the state.     The movie is as merciless as the book, thank God. I consider it the most faithful book adaptation. It was exactly as I imagined it while reading the book.     A masterpiece, still underrated.
B0009MAO46|5.0|A classic Pixar film that stands the test of time.  I enjoyed it about as much as my son.
0385340990|5.0|[[ASIN:0385340990 The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society]]<br />This book is a winner. One learns about the German occupation of Guernsey, about which I was totally ignorant, and it is easy to forget that this is a novel. The characters are so real, the descriptions so vivid that I feel that I could visit Guernsey (which I now very much desire to do) and find those houses and those people. With just a hint of Jane Austen, it is a book that one does not want to end. I recommend it highly.

0735619670|5.0|There is probably not a whole lot to say about this book that has not been said already, but it certainly deserves another positive review nonetheless.    I bought this book thinking that I did not have a whole lot to learn from it.  I was certain I had read enough 'better coding' material in the past to know what good code was and how to produce it.  I am sure you will not be surprised when I say that I ended up having a great deal to learn from this book.    Almost all of the coding advice, design strategies, and debugging techniques are backed up with real research data.  At the very least, this means that even if you know the advice is sound already, you can more easily introduce the topic to other programmers, or even to management, and it has a greater chance of being taken in to consideration.    After reading this book, my code quality has definitely increased.  I discovered that even the good practices I knew of before were not  being put to effective use.    The book is very specific.  It does not typically give you vague advice that sounds good if you don't think too hard about it.  It gives you very specific, concrete advice, with examples and data to back it up.    The author seems to have put a great deal of effort into writing this book for every type of programmer (and even for people in software management positions).  Every chapter introduction describes who should definitely read the chapter and who might benefit from simply skimming it over.  He will also direct the reader to other chapters or specific sections of the current chapter based on the reader's knowledge and experience levels.    Finally, as others have said, I consider this a must read book for any programmer.
0143144006|5.0|I heard Jill Bolte Taylor interviewed on NPR and knew I had to get this book for my mother. Mom has had severe verbal aphasia for 5 years, which means she can understand you and she knows what she wants to say, but cannot verbalize well. However, her abilities have improved a lot in just the past 90 days. She finds this book inspiring because the author completely recovered from her stroke in about 8 years.     I ran through a few of the revelations from the author with Mom. For example, she said that her stroke made her feel more connected with other people, as if we were all liquids instead of separate solids. \\"Yes!\\" Mom agreed heartily.       She also said that as the stroke occurred, aspects of it were actually enjoyable--e.g., losing the verbal imperative, thinking visually, etc. Another \\"yes\\" from Mom.      Highly recommended.     P.S. Mom's abilities have continued to improve. Last week she told my Dad, \\"You need to call [our daughter] and remind her about her 9:00 appointment in the morning!\\" She and Dad then laughed and laughed with joy. He called me and said, \\"Your mother has just uttered her most complex sentence in 5 years!\\"

B000002L9J|4.0|Never was too crazy for this, but it's hard to deny a consistency and proficiency of craft on the rock solid release. Despite the rigidly detached vibe throughout, each song excels at showcasing why The Smiths are widely regarded as Britain's definitive 80's indie band, laying out blueprints for massive future ripoffs, the likes bands such as Joy Division and only a few others exclusively enjoy in ultimate bragging derivative rites.

B0007KLH1Y|5.0|It's late August and I first purchased a set of Kapla blocks at Christmas.  I can say with certainty that this is one of the only toys to get regular play time 8 months later.  I originally bought one box of 200 for my nieces & nephew and one box of 50 for myself.  Once the other adult family members realized how fun and smart the blocks were, the collection grew to over 700!      The kids are constantly trying new designs and building things with more precision...and when they walk away to do something else, the adults jump in and try their own designs!      I can say with confidence that very few other toys have received as much play-time as these simple little wood blocks have.

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|i would read the book first and then watch the movie, the book is better but the movie gives you more of a reality picture of what you can see and do. I have recieved so much more insights to things in life. the movie is very helpful.
0316518565|3.0|Rogue Trader is an interesting tale of one man's rise and fall in the fast-paced world of derivatives trading.  A reader would likely need to possess an interest in business/derivatives to fully appreciate the nuts and bolts of the story.  I remember Leeson needing for the Nikkei to finish at 19,000 or better for all of the options he had been selling to pay off.  Would these be puts or calls?  Anyone reading this review, of course, knows the answer, but I can imagine this being very dull and tedious to one with no interest in such matters.  Leeson does give us an adequate explanation of the mechanics involved.    Yes, the book is a bit self-serving and bitter at times.  The biting sarcasm is absolutely appropriate and probably well-deserved whomever the targets may be.     What I came away with after reading this book was that we too often assume people know more than they really do especially in the world of finance.  For all of the big salaries and egos there at Barings Bank, management's financial acumen was no match for an unsupervised trading operation and systemic laziness within the bank both of which combined to bring the old merchant bank to a shameful and totally unnecessary end.
6304936362|5.0|If you are a World war 2 enthusiast, like I am, you have to see this film, it may not be the best film of the genre, but it is very entertaining and gives the viewer a glimpse of the war from the perspective of the ones who fought in it.
B0000DZTIW|3.0|Having watched The Last Samurai many times, I can anticipate almost every musical nuance in the film.  I think the music flavors the film almost perfectly.  So, naturally, I had to have the CD.      However, as I listen to the collection of songs on the CD, I am left uninspired and disappointed.  There are four songs I like very much, but even they don't totally work as a complete thought.      Rather, each of the songs is like a bad paragraph with well written sentences.    I think Hans Zimmer has done some tremendous work and I wish I had seen Cruise and Zwick acknowledge his contribution to the film's artistic elegance.  (If they did so, I will stand corrected)     Unfortunately, I don't think most of you who liked the movie and the music are going to be satisfied listening to the CD alone and out of context.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|Look at this pedal.  Look at what it does, and what it costs.  $30 for a tuner in a pedal form factor, and that's if you don't even try to hunt down a lower price.  By contrast, Boss's TU-2 is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing, and it costs $100 retail.<br /><br />Yes, the housing is made of plastic.  I don't know about you, but I generally won't be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set.  If you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever, it should survive.  And if it doesn't, so what?  It's cheap to replace.<br /><br />The other person on here obviously got a faulty model, which happens.  Mine's developed a touchy input jack over time (it's actually the earlier TU-100 model), but I don't know that it's totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap.  One star off for these kinds of quality control problems, just to be fair.  I own three other Behringer pedals as well, and they're still going strong.<br /><br />A tuner is an essential part of any musician's rig, and this does the job just fine.  Use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually affect your sound while playing.<br /><br />UPDATE: After having used a new tuning pedal for some time, I will admit that, yes, this is a subpar tuner.  However, I still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay, this isn't a bad investment.  For a guitarist just starting out, this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will affect your sound.
B00004WG2F|1.0|I never received this DVD and was sent a different movie instead.  I tried to request to be sent Legends of the Fall and was told there weren't anymore in stock!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|A great dance story.  Great music and dancers.  A lot of fun to watch over and over.
0385340567|1.0|One of the reasons I've always bought and read this series is that I enjoyed a main character with an unshakeable sense of honor and hardly any dithering.  So it was disappointing when the author jumped on the tired old anti-war bandwagon.  I thought at least he might hold it down to the usual \\"I hate this war but I honor the servicemen who fight in it,\\" but this time Reacher really goes in the tank.  \\"My country let me down, so I'm released from all personal honor, too.\\"  Who needs it?  It's the last Reacher novel I'll buy or read.    I guess if more servicemen had felt this way, we wouldn't have won the war while Child wasn't watching.
0930289234|5.0|I was excited about reading this novel because I'd heard such wonderful things about it.  However, my enthusiasm waned as I began to feel it was needlessly graphic and gory without having a \\"point.\\"  I complained to a friend, who recommended I finish it despite my objections.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did!  Every bit of what I had complained about had a point in the overarching storyline, and it all came into focus by the end.  I'm very pleased with the novel, and I would recommend it to anyone who can stand a little graphic gore in the name of a good story.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|It was a great elaboration of something every student has to read in school. Visualizing the monsters was difficult from the reading, it was nice to see them.  The computer method for creating this movie was fascinating to learn about and may be a future trend.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|This movie never gets old, and no matter how old I get, I still get a little misty.
B001E780W8|1.0|I don't know what direction these guys are trying to go in.  But, i'm certainly not liking it at all.  This cd is riddled with soft lullaby's.  And, when they decide to get heavy, it becomes the typical noise, fast beats, double bass garbage that has no groove/rhythm....just like every nickel and dime band out there today.  Did not like this cd at all.    ***EDIT***  I believe that this day and age, bands do not need to change their style.  There are a million different bands out there.  If you want to hear a different sound, buy a cd/mp3 from a different band!!  Nothing gets my blood boiling more, than getting all excited about a new album, buying it, only to find out the band has changed their sound, and I have wasted my money.  If I buy slipknot, I want to hear slipknot.  Sure, you can listen to the 30 second previews.  But I've bought many albums that sounded good based on the previews, and ended up being crap.  I know this will probably get a lot of people fired up.  But, I don't care.  I reviewed this album based on slipknot's body of previous work.  And, compared to that, this album is garbage.
055358202X|5.0|This searies has been phenominal! I just wish the next book would be finished soon.
B0012GMUPO|4.0|I have not listened Alice Cooper very much, but this record I found very interesting, especially \\"Poison\\" which theme, I feel, is slightly copied by the Finnish band Lordi in their Eurovison 2006 contest winner song \\"Hard Rock Hallelujah\\". As a whole I a agree with Alice Cooper himself, as he writes in his book \\"Golf Monster\\", this album to be the one of his bests \\"yet?\\". I sincerely recommend this record also to a little bit older enthusiasts.    A Midnight Golfer from Finland:-)
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I heard bits of the Album on NPR and I was blown away at how this was a forgotten album. The messages of this album is so relevant back then (although maybe not accepted by people), as it is now. The style and the sound is well at home today - I'll say much more so than back in the 1970s but it is well worth a listen.<br /><br />Just relax and listen to this album and let it hit you.
B00005JLR2|5.0|great kids movie
B000026C1Q|4.0|Having (foolishly) lost interest in APP around the time this album was originally released, I had never really considered purchasing it. That changed when La Segrada cycled through a couple of times for me on pandora.com. That one song was enough reason for me to order this CD.    Overall, I would consider this an average APP album. Not their best ( I am personally very fond of Ammonia Ave., Turn of a Friendly Card, and Tales of Mystery), but most certainly able to hold my interest and cause me to hit the \\"repeat\\" button. If for no other reason, La Segrada Familia is worth the purchase price all on its own. This song brings with it alot of energy and emotion, much more than I have been accustomed to from APP. Very few APP songs have grabbed my attention and stuck in my mind as well as this one does. It brings very well into focus for me what that structure must have meant and does mean for the people of Spain. It takes a very well written and performed piece of music to accomplish that type of transfer of empathy. This song does that very well!    As far as the rest of the album is concerned, again, the songs are average or above in general. I think the single that was released with this album originally, Standing on Higher Ground, has grown on me now far more than it did back then. Of course, the ending instrumental is more of a reprise of La Segrada and carries much of the same, catchy melodic passage. There are no bad songs on this album. Unlike many groups plodding along during the late 80s, APP never really \\"lost their way\\" (with the notable exception of Vulture Culture) or blended in with the music scene at the time. So, I think, APP's work has more musical validity now than it did even back then and does seem to be aging very well.    All-in-all, you won't go wrong with this album, especially considering that it was the last for the duo of Parsons and Wolfson.
B000E41MS6|5.0|The old Doctor Who shows were great; the new ones are even better for the new generation of Doctor Who fans.
B001AW9DKK|2.0|If you want a third rehash (Living with War, Living with War - In the Beginning and now this CD) of Neil's 2006 solo album - this will be your cup of tea. I'm not looking forward to the fourth attempt at trying to pry my money for essentially the same product (the DVD).    If you don't like Stephen Stills - I'd certainly purchase this just to look at the absolutely horrid photo of him inside. I'm guessing he did not select it (envision a constipated green blowfish exhaling while under duress). I'm guessing Stephen did not get a vote on that picture and I also suspect he and Neil aren't getting along (yet again).    The tour was a ** out of ***** tour and should have been called \\"Neil Young and his famous backup band\\" (and Neil is my favorite solo artist and the one artist I would see live above all others and have well over a dozen times).     Deja Vu was an absolutely wonderful CD and anyone who has not heard it should purchase it. This particular selection rates somewhere near the bottom third of the pack when one takes the Crosby, Nash, Stills and Young works (including solo) under consideration as a whole. For the completist only.     Even the Deja Vu song itself does not compare to the other versions of the song on Deja Vu, The Bridge School, Crosby Nash Live, the alternate version on Crosby's Voyage etc.     Unless and until the other three are treated as equals - I'm passing on the next tour. I'd rather see them solo at this point (where they don't sell themselves out for the tour $$$$$ as they have since they 'reformed').    Neil - bring back the Horse......

1554072840|3.0|This book was helpful in teaching my almost two year old what the potty was for. She loved the book.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|I have loved this movie for many years, and it is even better on Blu-ray.  The chase scenes through the valleys and hills are absolutely beautiful.  Even the bicycle scene is more enjoyable with a crisp picture.    This movie is in my top 5.  The best of the old west.  Newman and Redford both give great performances, and their interaction on screne is unmatched.  And certainly not to be over-looked, Katherine Ross plays her strong female role beautifully.    I could watch this movie over and over and over...
031606792X|5.0|Although the meaning of the cover drove me nuts, once I read those first words I was once again hooked to the \\"Twilight Saga\\". Reading it a second time prove to be best for me.I felt the whole birth and week after needed a more slow read to understand it .. end result?  Great book to a series I think should not end yet. I can't imagine a future without Edward and Bella and Jacob continuing on...so many possibilities.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I love how they set up this classic comic book story.  Batman is a very real person with lots of great toys and a passion for fighting injustice.  With this movie they created a very dark Gothem and a very dark story...as it was meant to be.  A vast improvement from where the films have been going until now.    And there is no better way to watch this than on Blu-ray!
160459201X|5.0|This book was simply Awesome!  I had gone online to read the reviews before I purchased the book;  And found that most people felt the way I do after reading this powerful book.  I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to see life from a different angle.  Enjoy!!
031606792X|1.0|It was the biggest dissapointment from a book I have read. Also the stupidest. It was not worth the money. Trust me. I wish I could get my money back :(
B00000F5KH|5.0|I watched \\"Central Station\\" last night with no real concept of what the movie was about.  I just knew that it had been nominated for the Best Foreign Language (BFL) Oscar in 1998.  So what film could have possibly beat a movie this good?  Well, turns out it was a tough year for the BFL with nominees that included \\"Grandfather\\", \\"Tango\\", \\"Children of Heaven\\", and the winner \\"Life is Beautiful\\".  With appologies to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", 1998 looks to me to have been a year where the Best Foreign Language nominees were, overall, better than the Best Picture nominees (other BP nominees were \\"Elizabeth\\", \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", \\"The Thin Red Line\\" and \\"Life is Beautiful\\").    I admit that I was not immediately drawn into \\"Central Station\\".  I realized later that the director did the ground work for \\"Central Station\\" very skillfully so that, when the movie \\"took off\\", we were very aware of who our main characters were.  This is a story of a journey by a very odd couple.  The various characters and challenges that they encounter touch our emotions and keep us wondering what will happen next.  In the end, we are left with that warm fuzzy feeling that only an excellent movie like this can deliver.  I was satisfied with the ending because I realized that the director, Walter Salles, had given us everything we needed.   He left us at the right emotional peak with the eventual outcome secure in our immagination.    The actors were new to me but they were, as a whole, excellent.  The scenes in the non-Amazonian back country of Brazil were impressive.  The directing was outstanding.  I remember one scene where our young boy, Josue, is alone and weeping in the station while evil eyes are looking out from dark corners. It was a brief, chilling reminder of what was at stake for Josue.  The imperfections in the main characters keeps \\"Central Station\\" from becoming too predictable.  Our emotional involvement is earned and tested and our satisfaction is real.  Don't miss a chance to see this one!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We've only watched the first CD so far, and are saving the rest for our vacation next week. It is beautiful!
0061537934|5.0|I read alot of non-fiction and fiction and alot about animals, because I love them, and because I am a dog trainer. Also a Licensed Clinical Social Worker.  This author was right on about grieving issues and how the characters (man and dog)reacted to situations in the story.  I loved that Enzo narrated the story.   Couldn't put it down.  What a guy (the author) and where did his sensitivity and creativity come from.   Thank you for something wonderful out in the world of the written word.
031606792X|4.0|I loved the first 3 books and was eagerly anticipaing the 4th. I read the book in 2 days and was really disapponited. I guess I just expected too much out of this last book in the series.....
