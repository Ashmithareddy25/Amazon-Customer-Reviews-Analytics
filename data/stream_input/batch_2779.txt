B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best game ever! I love it! It is great for kids because it is a non-violent game. I mean doesn't want a virtual pet horse.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I got stuck on level 7 with the four color-coded numbers that went to the box on the shelf. I also got stuck on level 10 with getting the key out of the box behind the vent, and with where to use the drill. I really didn't want to, but after a while of trial-and-too-much-error I eventually broke down and had to use walkthroughs for those three things. (I still don't understand why it was those numbers for level 7) Other than that it was fun and kept my intrest.
0064471837|5.0|When I first cracked open this book as a young child, i was a little skeptical. I loved fantasy and magic. I'd completed Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I thought nothing could top it off. The Abhorsen Trilogy's Sabriel took me to magical places I'd never thought could exist. Once I read the first one (in 2 days, might I add) I was ready for more. I read them all in about a week and a half (only that slow because I still had to attend school!) and now that it's been almost 8 years, I'm 21 and have read them all 4 times each, and am saving some extra non-bill money to buy the whole trilogy in a matching set. I've always dreamt of having a lifesize replica of her bells. I think I'd be moved to tears to have them. This book inspired my childhood and I fell in love with the characters in this book almost as hard as I'd fallen for my boyfriend (who will now be my husband in 2 months!) I guess what I'm trying to say is.<br /><br />This book is like middle school sweethearts spending all their years of school together, then getting married. I would marry this book :P
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Bought this to use with my cast iron Dutch Ovens. This smaller starter is just the right size to produce coals for my 12' oven, and considerably smaller that the other starters out there - good for when we take the rig camping.

B008FPOIT6|4.0|Penumbras is a metaphor for a life well lived and the soul of this book is in the noble journeys of Its oh-so-geeky heroes. How clever and timely to weave in the up to the minute tech culture and let it flourish in a setting devoid of ugly behavior and senseless violence -- dragons excluded...
B000002KOQ|5.0|Joni Mitchell is one of the most classy artists of our time. Her songs and words and beautiful but simple instruments are like no other.<br />Everyone tries to copy her voice and style but no one ever will. She never has stopped smoking and she is 70 now still puffing away, so I am not as much a fan of her work last 10 years.
0375842209|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I wish I could remember who I loaned it<br />to, so I could ask for it back.

0064471837|5.0|I remember reading sabriel when I was a 10 year old boy and some error with the book deliveries to the local schools had ended with a few copies of books made for older audience's reaching my primary school instead. At the time I hated english, writing and reading in general as I found it all stale, yet we had to pick a book to read every week. So little me picked out the only copy of sabriel and grudgingly took it home. I proceeded to read it into the early morning, in class, at break, at registration, at home, over friends, basically any time I could and I fell in love with writing in general. My hatred for writing vanished as for the first time ever i'd found a book, that I enjoyed! My teachers would comment on my obsession with the book and ask how many times I read it. By the end of the year i'd easily read the book 30-40 times. I worry about my younger self :P Even worse I still own this book, that's right the only crime I've committed in my life was stealing a book. How odd :O!<br /><br />Now as 19 year old hopeful writer, I have every single book by this supremely talented author and have read each of them (apart from ragwitch) many times over. You cannot be disappointed by this series there isn't room for boredom, no idle conversation, no failed character development. Only a disturbingly absorbing story that completely engages you.<br />If you're bored and need a book to read. Look no further you have found the pinnacle of creative talent.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love how easy it is to see the weather. It's accurate, too. And I love the new mpoints thingy. I just donated to a hospital! :)
1439102813|5.0|This story will really touch home, if you've had anyone in your family with Alzheimer's. I couldn't put the book down!!
1439156816|5.0|Funny. This is the first of his books that I've read, but I've systematically avoided the movie adaptations of his novels for years because I'm a pansy. Seeing the clip of The Shining during the drive-in scene in Twister gave me nightmares for weeks. Anyway, I couldn't help but read this book in two or three sittings. I have something of a collection of craft books because, during different stages of my life, I think they'll do any good at all when it comes to sitting down and writing.<br /><br />I'm resigned to the fact that they won't. But they do provide a greater service--they remind you that nothing will help when it comes to sitting down and writing. The greatest disservice you can do to yourself is to over-rationalize, hyper-systematize, or uber-categorize writing. This is a clumsy way to sum up King's eloquent--albeit plainspoken--writing lessons.<br /><br />With that said, I could have cut out the On Writing part of the book, with the style lessons and such, and probably enjoyed the read more. The scenes of his early married life and his struggle to overcome a nearly fatal accident were haunted by writing like a quiet friend who never leaves, always sitting in the corner of your hospital room, nodding his head because he knows what's on your mind.

B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game is tough to play. The app itself is free but you have all these options to buy into higher levels, costumes, etc which is frustrating for my daughter since I'm not spending a mint on playing this game. Would not recommend especially for kids.

0064471837|5.0|I have read Sabriel and the rest of this series several times and it is one of my favourite reads. I could never get bored of reading about Sabriel's (and the other's) adventures.<br /><br />From beginning to end you are cast into a wonderful intriguing worlds of Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom. Where the best comparison I could make to explain the contrast between these world are 1930's and almost medieval times respectively. Ancelstierre a modern world relying on machinery and new contraptions in the form of cars and vehicle and the Old Kingdom of magic and superstition and the dead.<br /><br />Your imagination runs wild with Garth Nix amazing story telling talent. I have been captivated for many hours reading this story. The characters all have depth and you instanly feel like you are there with them and they could easily be someone you know very well. The story itself is fascinating and complete. (i hate it when a three is started then just forgotten about and never referred to again). It is also a wonderful coming of age tale of Sabriel needing to grow up very quickly and to learn her about her responsibilities under difficult circumstances.<br /><br />One of my favourite characters in the book and the series is Mogget. A fascinating creature who obviously knows more than he's letting on and who also has a great depth.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to all ages I was in my early 20's when I first came across this book and now in my thirties and still love.  I am thrilled that Garth Nix has another for the Old Kingdom series in the pipeline - Clariel - and anxiously waiting for its release (some time to go yet). If Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen are anything to go by, Clariel is not to be missed.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was very good.  I usually don't like to watch a movie if I've read the book first because it's never as good but this movie was different.  I can't wait to watch the 2nd one!

B004MSWLU8|5.0|I purchased this book after going to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.  I am not a huge book reader, but I did enjoy reading this book. I can see how reading this book could be useful before going to the house, but I think it is a better effect if you read it after.  It really helped me to connect what Anne wrote to the actual conditions that she and her family had to live through.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book as it is an important piece of history.  Definitely buy it and read it.  It is best to read or re-read this after going to her house in Amsterdam.<br /><br />Just a note about this version, there are some sections in the book that were very personal (about puberty, specifically) that could offend people.

B000641D2Y|5.0|I love this movie almost as much as the first, even though it is along the same lines as the first, just in a different city.  Honestly, I sometimes watch it during the middle of summer.  It's just a really entertaining movie from my childhood.
0312641893|2.0|The cover and synopsis of Cinder had me entranced. A futuristic sic-fi re-telling of Cinderella? Yes, please! Sadly, I wasn't happy with this book at all. While I enjoyed certain aspects, like the characters, it wasn't enough for me to love this book. I do have Scarlet, the second book in the quartet on hand and I'm hoping it's better.<br /><br />Let's start with the plot. I want to point out that there was so much potential for the plot to be amazing but sadly, it was really predictable. Besides knowing who's going to end up with who (after all, this is a re-telling), I figured out a key aspect of the plot almost 15% into this book. There was no sense of surprise in this novel for me and that was not okay. I found myself getting bored and I even admit to skimming some pages because I just didn't care. I thought about not worrying about it since this was Marissa Meyer's debut novel but that seemed wrong. The second half of the book had much more action which was fantastic because the first half was a chore to get through.<br /><br />I was also surprised at the lack of world building. As I said, this is considered a sci-fi book but I found some aspects to be border line fantasy. All of the special powers that some of the characters possess seem to just be there. I really wanted more background as to how it all came to be. The only explanation was that it was because they lived on the moon. Being the science nerd I am, I began to wonder if it had to do with DNA changes or particles in the air or something else that caused the powers. But nothing was explained and that was rather sad.<br /><br />I did like many of the characters. Cinder was a fantastic protagonist. She was brave and smart and loving. She was also willing to do whatever she needed to to help her step sister (the one who likes her anyways) and for the people she cared for. Even though she was strong willed, I liked the aspects in which she was confused or sad since it made her seem more relatable. Iko was hilarious and a much needed distraction from all of the drama but she was also the best friend Cinder needed. Kai wasn't as fleshed out as I had wanted him to be but I was willing to put that aside. Honestly, I wasn't in love with their relationship. I felt like there was no spark and all of the times there should have been tension between the two, I felt nothing.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't like Cinder. I liked out protagonist but combined with the predictable plot and lack of world building, it wasn't a book I enjoyed. I want to give this book more than 2 stars but really, the 2 stars come from liking Cinder and Iko.

B000TGCR38|4.0|I won't go into the plot in detail but this is an interesting movie about civilian life in the Netherlands and their interaction with the Germans during WWII (filmed as a flashback).  I purchased this as I live in the Netherlands, as an American, in an attempt to learn Dutch.  I watched this with the English subtitles on and really enjoyed it. I would suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see a take on WWII other than an American take.  And there are actually a couple scenes that are in English.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|A great app for quick searches and bidding, great for travel or for remembering purchases. Would recommend to friend and family.
0064471837|5.0|my mom bought me the first book in this series, (Sabriel) when i was in middle school and since then i have read all three of these books over and over again. the world is well built and deep- full of people you want to get to know. things are described so clearly that it's no challenge to see the events play out behind your eyes. this is my go-to series when someone asks for a recommendation or i need a gift  for a fantasy lover. i'd love to see this on the big screen someday, it would make a beautiful anime! (think howl's moving castle, just..... sharper) don't forget to pick up garth nix's book of short stories, \\"behind the wall\\", the first story in the collection is a short novella that takes place after the 3ed book! :)

B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I've been a fitbit user for a good while (Ultra and then One) and based on my experiences and comparisons with fitbit, I like this tracker, but have a few issues with it that hopefully they'll work out eventually.  First the GOOD: 1. Syncs with my phone (Nexus 4) with no problems and setup was a breeze. 2. Charges on a normal micro usb cable (no more losing the fitbit charging cable and being unable to use it for a week at a time) 3. Seems to count less &#34;ghost&#34; steps while riding in the car or moving in my desk chair, etc. 4. My history is viewable on the device itself with a simple backwards swipe of my finger. 5. Battery is about the same as my One at about 10 days so far. 6. I've had no issues with the heart rate monitor. The numbers it provides match up with my blood pressure cuff and takes just a few seconds. 7. The app for android and apple both are well organized, comprehensive and tend to keep me focused on what I need to be doing more of (sleeping, walking, keeping an eye on my heart rate, losing that pound for the week). 8. Automatically starts counting distance when it senses a run (I haven't used this feature, but see how it could be very useful for a runner.) 9. Sleep tracker data seems to match how I FELT that I slept better than previously used trackers.  Comfortable wristband for that as well. 10. Clip is more secure and the tracker doesn't seem to be able to get out with normal wear (fitbit fell out a few times)  While mostly satisfied, I do have a few ISSUES with my pulse:  1. Elevation is grossly inaccurate. After a day of hiking 200 meters of elevation plus several floors of stairs, my pulse showed that I'd done 10 meters. 2. No correcting of sleep start and stop times on the website. Several times the sleep function has turned itself off prematurely (maybe I bumped the button?) or turned itself on during the day and once I forgot to turn it off  when I got up in the morning and it would have been useful in all cases to be able to manually correct the time in and out of bed. (I really miss this feature from fitbit.) 3. No setting of personal step goals. I'd like to be able to manage my these personally, but that feature is not yet available (although may be coming soon according to the Withings facebook rep).  While 10,000 steps is recommended for the general population, I have an illness that sometimes keeps me from walking almost at all and other days 15,000 steps are within my capabilities.  More control over my goals would let me keep them realistic and attainable based on what's physically possible. 4. The screen can't easily be read in bright sun. Not a big deal, but if you're someone who likes to keep close tabs on what you're doing, every 30 minutes, the screen dullness may bother you.  Would I buy it again? Yes. I love the extra features this tracker has to offer. Do I hope they continue to improve it? YES! It would be near perfect in my eyes if it would allow manual entering of data (sleep) and personal step goals. If they change these features or fix the elevation counting issue, I'll come back to update.  Until then 4 stars for me.

B009A9SULS|1.0|Loved if the first four months, portable, legible, plenty of storage and great form factor...then after turning it off--off mode displays the book cover of the book currently being read--only half of the screen turned back on with the lower half still displaying a portion of the original book cover.  Resets, recharges, etc. have done nothing and Kobo support appears non existant.  Too bad, very happy with it whie it worked but too expensive to risk trying again.  Be aware plenty of online forums with Kobo-related complaints even if they're not reflected in these reviews.  Dismissive customer service appears to be a constant complaint.

006207377X|4.0|One Two Buckle My Shoe (also published under the title The Patriotic Murders) begins with the murder of a dentist, no doubt a piece of vicarious wish fulfillment for some readers.<br /><br />Although initially treated by the police as suicide, master detective Hercule Poirot, one of the dentist's last patients, has his suspicions from the beginning, and we eventually run through a cavalcade of suspects and red herrings before coming to a rather convoluted resolution to the mystery. But to me the most interesting thing about the book is not the Rube Goldberg solution but how the usually apolitical Agatha Christie gives us a glimpse of her politics, which seems to lean toward favoring conservative fiscal policy and established traditions over radical change to achieve some vision of social justice. Or at least that is what her hero Poirot seems to favor.<br /><br />It's interesting to contrast Christie with contemporaries like George Orwell and John Steinbeck, who were very much in favor of radical change and made no bones about it. Curiously, Christie's \\"coming out\\" is almost anachronistic, since One Two Buckle My Shoe was published (and I assume written) after World War II was well underway in Europe, effectively ending the period of the 20s and 30s when the direction of domestic policy could be debated in England and elsewhere with no outside distractions. With the start of war, those arguments were put on the back burner as simple national survival became the overriding consideration. In fact, the book was first serialized in America and published in book form in England just as the Blitz was raining bombs on English cities and the threat of Nazi invasion from across the Channel was a very real possibility. Under those circumstances, even Orwell was willing to put domestic squabbles aside in favor of defending the Homeland, as articulated in his contemporaneous essay My Country Right or Left.<br /><br />The other fascinating thing about One Two Buckle My Shoe is the continued evolution of Poirot. It has been my impression, as I am reading Christie's Poirot novels in chronological order, that Christie was starting to get tired of him at this point. In the three Poirot novels preceding One Two Buckle My Shoe (Appointment With Death, Hercule Poirot's Christmas, Sad Cypress) the little Belgian is somewhat minimized as Christie spends extra time on the other characters. In Christmas, despite getting title billing for the first time, Poirot is really little more than a plot device for solving the case rather than the focus of the narrative.<br /><br />But in One Two Buckle My Shoe, Poirot is clearly back in the forefront, and he is an especially forceful presence driving the story. He also ends up as the moral center. Christie also spends extra time rounding and humanizing him, humorously with his anxiety about visiting the dentist and almost poignantly with his \\"Am I getting too old?\\" questioning of himself at one point in the investigation. Well, turns out he isn't, or at least not took old to solve an intricate mystery, as this novel shows.he continued evolution of Poirot.

B00DU74U74|4.0|First, I have not read the book, so I can't compare there. I have read a couple of the Twilight series and am not a huge fan. I found this story more intriging and entertaining and less overly teen drama. I might have even given it five stars if it weren't for the outrageous love triangle Meyer's put in it!
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|This is a great movie for guys and girls! I don't buy many movies, but this was worth buying.  Arrived quickly too.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a page-turner of a game, requiring continual interaction, so it's hard to put down.  Its clock keeps ticking overnight. There are reef plants and corals to purchase with \\"sand dollars\\" and \\"grow\\" with \\"algae\\". Mystery seeds become Rare Plants (but not always) to attract Rare Fish which will give Pearls in a day or three if you feed them algae. You can visit your friends' reefs, or random reefs, and work together on Co-op Quests.  Advance all the way to level 50 (original version had 40 levels), perhaps a level a day at first; it takes more and more points (Sea stars) to complete each level. Nemo and Dory and Ray give suggestions and little story lines. Follow the suggestions to gain stars to help advance to the next level. Occasional Challenges provide limited-edition Rare Fish, daily assignments keep the game going and earning star points.<br /><br />New Content appears sometimes, and if there's enough changes, a new Update is forced on you. The new version, 1.6.1 appeared at Amazon in May 2014; other platforms got it sooner. The update added Turtles Crush and Squirt, and new item spines (used to open chests.)  When there is a problem Disney Support has helped me.<br /><br />I'm on Android tablet with this game. You can get it for iPhone, iPad and Android phone.  There is a discussion group of users at gamesdreams.com which you should find and read before you spend all your pearls.  (It's too easy to use them, and buying more costs real money!) Pearls, algae and sand dollars can be bought for real money.  Treasure chests may yield pearls. The game requires Internet, and its server is sometimes down.  There's no \\"exit\\" button, so learn how to force-quit on your device. No guidebook unless it's posted by a user at the group.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I enjoy watching the episodes. Very well done! Great choise for actors and perfect play!<br />The history is presented in an interesting and enchanting way.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Easy read. Simple to understand. Motivational. Practical. This book will improve many people's lives. I know it did mine. Thanks
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix has created a masterpiece! I happened upon this series a few years ago and it has quickly become my favorite of all time.  Sabriel especially is a must read. The story of Sabriels journey to find what happened to her father, while taking on his position as the Abhorsen, captures you from the start and makes your heart ache.  Garth Nix has a cleverly exceptional way of pulling his readers into this beautiful fantasy world.  As the reader I couldn't put these books down even though I never wanted the story to end.  This is the type of series you are looking for! When this book becomes a motion picture I will be first in line! Five Stars.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|If you want an addictive, stimulating puzzle this is the puzzle/game for you. Some are easier than others but it makes you think differently than most computer games
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Beautiful graphics, very player friendly game. Voice overlay was great my biggest peeve is reading character cards on rpg's. Could have done without mini games, however still a splendid game.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Wow, wow, wow,I hated to put the book down, I even took off work this afternoon to finish it up. On to the next!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Extremely erotic story that I found that I just could not put down. The scenes as described are very realistic. The progression of intensity is believable, including the mistakes where Ana calls &#34;RED!&#34;. The overlaying dramatic story line is entertaining and gives a framework for the erotic to exist in.

B004NROYUI|1.0|This case appears to be a fake.  I had an original case from Fujifilm and bought this to replace the top half, which I had lost.  This product is made a very different type of material.  It may be leather, but it is definitely a cheaper quality leather or possibly vinyl.  The base on this also doesn't have the flap on the real product for accessing the battery and memory card door.  The word &#34;Fujifilm&#34; is embossed on the case, but the lettering doesn't look like the original.  The case did come in what appeared to be a real Fujifilm box, but the box had clearly been opened and resealed and wasn't in new condition.<br /><br />This is really appalling, as the knock-off cases on Amazon sell for $25.  If you are okay with a knock-off (which are probably about as good for protecting the camera), buy one of those.  If you want the real case from Fujifilm, don't buy this one.
0385344325|5.0|Another EXCELLENT Jack Reacher book by Lee Child.  I have now read 16 of his 18 books and will start on number 17 shortly.  I have enjoyed every single one of them and \\"The Affair\\" may be the best of the bunch (so far).  However, had I read Mr. Child's website I would have realized that \\"The Enemy\\" and \\"The Affair\\" are both prequels to the other books.  You can pick them up and read them in any order and \\"The Enemy\\" didn't bother me because I sort of read it like a flashback.  But, \\"The Affair\\" introduced people from Reacher's life in the military and his brother ... and if you read them in the order published, you know what happens to some of those characters.  It just sort of spoiled it having read the other books first.<br /><br />All of that having been said, \\"The Affair\\" was a GREAT read.  Once again, the author keeps you in suspense until the very end.  Each night I would pick up the book with the intent of reading one ... maybe two ... chapters and, as usual, I could not stop at one or two.  \\"The Affair,\\" in particular is a book that makes you wish you could read the entire book at one sitting.
B008476HBM|4.0|Elizabeth Bennett is living a young adults life learning what it takes to be a lady and a member of society. She watches her sister's obsess over getting married, witnesses her parents loveless marriage, and longs to travel and find happiness.  She is also very opinionated, a trait which catches the eye of many young men in the town. Unlike her sister's, Elizabeth is picky about her suitors and refuses to settle just for the sake of being married. A good story of growing up and learning about life. Fun read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the different ways to look at. the weather maps radar sattelite always up to date you can look at hour by hot or the whole week and further if you choose
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|3.5 stars for the price, form factor, ease of setup and works well with Netflix, Youtube and GooglePlay. Deduct some points for setup issue, can't play local contents (not Airplay-like) and lack of WOW factor. The product name, Chromecast, makes me think casting from Chrome browser is the key feature. It's not! TabCast on Chrome browser, is still in Beta and it doesn't support Android/iOS mobile device. As of now, it's really just a media streamer that allows Android/iOS/Windows mobile device<br />to select, play and control online contents from the 3 online video services mentioned above. This product is comparable to a Roku Streaming HDMI stick or Plair (home.plair.com), but definitely not in the category of wireless display (Miracast/WiDi) or DLNA/AirPlay media adapter.<br /><br />Below is my full hands on experience review against various devices, with different test cases and even at 2nd location.<br /><br />The Requirements<br /><br />For setup - I suggest to use a laptop, phone, or tablet and have it connected to your Wi-Fi router.  You should have the Wi-Fi PIN in handy. Depends on what you want to stream, you'll need to have either YouTube or Netflix app (and an account). Google Play is readily available on Android devices.<br /><br />Out-of-box Setup<br /><br />Even though the instruction printed on the packaging is very clear, the initial setup experience did not go smooth as I had expected. Connecting the HDMI dongle to the TV and USB cable for power was a piece of cake even my grandma can do. Once you've done that, the TV displays \\"Set me up\\" and instructs \\"On your laptop or phone, visit: google.com/chromecast/setup\\" with the setup name \\"ChromecastXXXX\\". However, it's setting the Wi-Fi connection that I encountered troubles and I think it could happen to other folks.<br />- I tried first with an Android phone, Nexus 4, the browser URL pointed to Google Play store to download and launch Chromecast app. It took a few tries for the app to detect and display my Chromecast, and then I was able to tell Chromecast to connect to my Wi-Fi router by providing it the PIN. Once I provided the wireless router's PIN, Chromecast then connects to the router and displays it's \\"Ready to Cast\\".<br />- On an iPad/iPhone, there is no Chromecast app available so the URL directs me to Google's online setup webpage. It's basically telling user to manually connect the phone Wi-Fi to the Chromecast device with SSID \\"ChromecastXXXX\\" and then configure its Wi-Fi setting to pair with the wireless router. It's good to have the Wi-Fi router's PIN in handy as you'll be asked to enter that information. Once that's configured, it connects to the Wi-Fi router and displays \\"Ready to Cast\\"<br />- On my laptop (Win8), Google setup site recommends to use the Chromecast utility to help with the setup. The utility works like a charm! It's almost like a wizard that could automatically extract the PIN from your existing Wi-Fi connection, connect to the Chromecast device, pushes the PIN to it and connects to the Wi-Fi router.<br /><br />The app is well designed and provides the best connection experience IMO.<br /><br />Note: If the system is connected to your Wi-Fi router via Cat-5 cable and your Wireless is turned off, then it will not be able to detect Chromecast.  Turn on the Wi-Fi and the app will be able to detect and connect to Chromecast.<br /><br />Streaming Experience<br /><br />Once the TV displays \\"Ready to Cast\\" screen, I was able to play online videos by touching the screen. Chromecast just figures out what video I want to play and then it pulls the content directly from the online content service's server. After a short ~5 seconds delay from the time I click play, the TV displays a buffering status and then plays the video without any hiccup. The video quality is probably 1080p or at least 720p - I'm not sure but it looked very clear. Once the movie is playing, I could make or receive phone call and do anything on the phone without affectingthe video stream on TV.<br />- Using Netflix app: The app works very well on both Nexus 4 and iPhone 5, but I've been seeing 'black screen of death' with Nexus 4 (Android 4.3) lately whenever I use Netflix [huge bug according to Android forums]. Netflix app displays the option for you to \\"Play on\\" ChromecastXXXX and will tell Chromecast to fetch the content from Netflix to display. I could rewind, forward and pause the video from the app, but I can't find a way to permanently stop the video. The volume can be controlled<br />from the app or from the volume button on the mobile device.  Netflix also allows you to toggle where you want the video play between the mobile device or TV, which is good because I start in one room and continue on another device from another room later. If there's another Chromecast TV in the house, I think it might be able to shift the video over there and continue where it left off. Since Netflix is the creator of the \\"DIAL\\" technology used in Chromecast so it's no surprise their app works so well.<br />- Youtube and GooglePlay: Similar streaming experience as Netflix, with the little cast-to-screen icon available on the app to Play On TV. I didn't use these apps as much so I don't know if there's any particular goods and bad.<br /><br />TabCast Experience<br /><br />I find this feature is OK, but not great as there are issues pending on the Wi-Fi environment and some websites. Noted the product description says support for \\"select web content through Chrome browser\\".  This feature is still in Beta as labeled on the plug-in, but not mentioned on the product webpage or Amazon's description. To use the feature, I need to download and install plug-in \\"GoogleCast\\".  Not to be confused with ChromeCast plug-in as it's taken by some 3rd party developer.  Once the plug-in is installed to Chrome browser, there's a Cast-to-TV icon showing on the right of the URL address bar. Click on icon allows me the option to \\"Cast this tab to...\\" and Chromecast device of my choice.  The max video quality supported is 720p coming from the browser tab and the computer needs to be at least an Core i5 CPU. I notice my laptop CPU is put to work when I stream from site like ABC/HULU/Vimeo as TabCast clones my browser page and mirrors to the TV.  The experience is odd as I can see what I browsed on the TV, but there's no mouse cursor.  There was noticeable latency as each click takes about 1-2 seconds for TV to update the images.  Nevertheless, both video and audio play on the TV via TabCast.<br />With Netflix and YouTube websites, there's a Cast-to option built-in to the player and the video gets retrieved directly from the device so the system is not put to work.  The supported video quality here is better since it's pulling directly from the service sites and does not go through many network hops.<br />There are certain times I notice a much bigger latency and my video disconnects in the middle of of playing while using TabCast.  This seems to be a Wi-Fi congestion problem or CPU overloads that the data has hard time traveling from laptop-to-router-to-Chromecast.  It is similar to the AppleTV Airplay (mirroring) feature and it also has some mixed reviews due to the many network hops issue.<br />Also TabCast plug-in is only available for Chrome browser on Windows/MAC system. The Chrome app on iOS does not allow you to TabCast since there's no plugin.  So the answer is No to the question \\"Can I cast a tab from phone or tablet's Chrome browser?\\"<br /><br />2nd Location / Portability<br /><br />It's such a small gadget (key fob size) that I was able to put in my pocket and took it to my friend's house.  I forgot to bring the USB micro cable, but good thing my friend had a USB micro cable available.  I'm not sure if Chromecast can be powered with an MHL-enabled HDMI port, but didn't matter since my friend's HDTV doesn't have MHL anyway.  Google doesn't mention about MHL support probably because the # of TVs with MHL is pretty low and most consumers don't even know about it.  The device powered on and looked for the previous wi-fi router connection, so I had to repeat the setup and provide the new wi-fi router's information.  Once it's connected and online, I was able to repeat the stream like I did at home.  I guess people can bring it on the road to hotels, but keep in mind the newer LCD/LED TVs at hotels don't allow people to change the HDMI input.  Also remember to bring the USB cable, power prong and get the Wi-Fi code for it to connect.<br /><br />Would I Recommend?<br />Yes, if you don't have Netflix or Youtube on your TV or Blu-ray player already.<br />No, if you're looking for a media player to stream local files from mobile devices or NAS on the network. Or looking to mirror anything from phone, tablet or laptop's screen to the TV<br /><br />Pros and Cons<br />Pros<br />- Setup app on PC is excellent and props for auto-grab of the existing Wi-Fi PIN feature.  Who remembers their Wi-Fi router PIN??<br />- On screen user friendly GUI<br />- The superb experience of browsing media on mobile device and hand off to Chromecast to play<br />- You can do other things on your mobile device while the video plays on TV, thus save battery<br />- Can stream from Netflix, YouTube and GooglePlay real well<br />- Control Chromecast with Netflix app trick mode is excellent, almost like a remote control<br />- The small compact sized form factor and USB power allows it to shut down when the TV is turned off<br />- The packaging, accessories and instructions<br />- The price! $35!? take my money Google even though I already have Netflix and YouTube built-in to my TVs and BD Player<br /><br />Cons<br />- Setup isn't smooth with mobile devices<br />- Can't permanently stop video on Netflix, thus may result to \\"over the allowed players limit\\" message on Netflix if you want to watch on a different device<br />- While using TabCast, someone can hijack the TV by sending video from Netflix/YouTube app or vice-versa (can be done from another room)<br />- TabCast is strictly for Windows/MAC Chrome browser with plug-in.  Cannot cast a tab from phone or tablet with Chrome app.<br />- Chromecast can't handle 1080p while using TabCast ... even from a powerful system<br />- No support for local contents playback (i.e. photos, music and recorded video on mobile devices).  I hear you can install additional plug-in, Plex, to PC and move the file to the TV via Chromecast<br />- No DLNA DMP support, thus you can't push media contents from other places to Chromecast like you can with AppleTV (AirPlay)<br /><br />Tips<br />- Use Chromecast Windows/Mac utility to find out the firmware version<br />- Use the utility to Reset the device to Factory default setting - or press and hold the push button for 10 seconds<br />- Chromecast Wi-Fi is on 2.4GHz band.  If your Wi-Fi router is dual-band, it should support 2 SSIDs (2.4 and 5GHz).  Chromecast will only see the 2.4GHz SSID<br />- If your Wi-Fi router is a dual-band, ensure it's not in AP isolation mode<br />- If your router has MAC whitelisting - your Wi-Fi network allows this device and your Chromecast to join<br />- Ensure you are not connected to VPN
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Not a fast reader, but I tore through this. It's part adventure, part personal journey, part physiology. Has convinced me of the merits of running in a more natural way and so far so good on that front. Books normally have a single heroic protagonist but this is different. Inspirational. Will enjoy a reread before long I think. Bought on kindle.
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|Before owning this dual socket USB charger, I owned/tested five other car chargers. The first thing that struck me about the design and manufacturing is how extremely tight the fit was compared to the others models tested.  The metal scraping and plastic crunching is a bit disconcerting. Secondly, for whatever reason, it charges my Galaxy Note II smartphone (i.e. phablet) slower than my OEM wall charger. I have seen this before with other high amperage wall and car chargers that should have no problem providing the necessary current. Hence, this might be some subtle circuitry issue particular to Samsung and/or this particular phone.<br /><br />That being said, Samsung might have a special way to impede non-oem charging that yet been reverse engineered. If anything, Anker and its competitors should try to understand what causes the slow charging.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Too bad this doesn't work on the Kindle Fire hd. I played magic a lot when I was younger and was looking forward to the game on my KF. However, like other reviews said, it will not install on my Kindle and almost caused me to do a factory reset. I was able to download the app but had all kinds of trouble while trying to install. Almost caused me to do a factory reset since it completely froze my Kindle and have me errors. It took me a couple tries to get the app deleted off my Kindle. Hopefully there will be an update to fix this major problem so the Kindle owners can play too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Enjoy playing this game!would recommend it to all ages. I like the variety of dragons you can create. And the way your able to design your own area by picking which trees to move out or leave in.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|I was happy when this game was the FAOTD. I just have to say how really glad I am that I did not pay for this. Like another reviewer said, there is SO much talking! The characters in the game are just horrible. Real pictures of people with one facial expression and only a mouth moving. It was painful just to watch. I usually ended up clicking past the conversations and ignored parts of the very weak attempt of a plot. The games themselves were okay. Nothing overly hard, a couple frustrating parts when the order of things that you needed to do wasn't clear. I finished the game fairly quickly and I'm not really that upset because I was getting tired of hearing the main characters whiny voice say &quot;let me help you find that!&quot; There really isn't any replay value with this game so you'll have to decide if a few hours of a painful plot is worth the few bucks. For me, not so much.

B00C9V1ONU|4.0|This is certainly one of the better animated movies I've watched in recent times.<br /><br />Bottom line: Yes, you should definitely watch it!
B009FXIICK|4.0|Fun and easy to understand, it passes short periods of time quickly as a distraction.<br />Unfortunately I've reached a point that I can't really get a better score or further. It has that Tetris feel of hitting that one level that's impossible no matter what you do.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great book. It is a little slow to get started, but once it does, it is hard to put down. Best ending I've read in a long time!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For reference, this is my setup:<br /><br />Time Warner Cable in Austin, Texas with gamer speed, on really old shared wiring that is so bad there isn't enough power to get actual cable--I just have cable internet; a MediaLink router; a four-year-old Korean re-branded Viore monitor without a working antenna, but with three HDMI ports; and, a two-year old basic Dell, factory setup laptop.<br /><br />Having said that:  my cable service, despite paying for \\"gamer speed\\", is pretty shoddy during peak hours.  HuluPlus and Amazon on Demand seem to have packet streaming that deals with that pretty well--I have to restart movies during peak hours, two or three times, but other than that I don't have much interruption.<br /><br />But, I thought this didn't work at all with a two-year-old Dell laptop because it couldn't connect during peak hours. (It wouldn't work at 10 p.m. on a Monday night). Then, my boyfriend got it to \\"Cast\\" using a Samsung phone at about 11:00 p.m.. We like to watch very old Led Zeppelin videos on YouTube, and it did work well for that. The video and audio with even really old footage is excellent.<br /><br />The next day, I had no problem at all getting it to cast at 1:00 a.m., from my laptop.  As of this writing, though, I don't think it works unless your cable is really good.<br /><br />If you have bad internet, this isn't worth the money.  The free Netflix is nice, though.
B001P7HUF0|1.0|Very disappointed with Amazon prime video. Stopped all of a sudden and never resumed back. Not sure if this is kind of a trick where we are forced to buy and watch the movie. Have expected something really better from Amazon.
0525953728|4.0|For a first hand account of a day that changed the world we live in, I think the book was great.  I didn't care for how much the book jumped around during the story.  I understand it builds the character, but it was a bit confusing at times.  I don't care to read books and bought this to give me something to do during recovery from a surgery.  I read it in a couple days and then handed it to my son to read.  He finished the book and had a lot of questions.  All-in-all, I would recommend this book for anyone that wants a more clear story of what really happened and how it all went down from the beginning.

B0057UA4FY|5.0|Many years ago when the Clone Wars movie came out, I loved it as a kid. Now several years later I decided to watch the seasons of the clone wars and I thoroughly enjoyed them. I really enjoy the story arcs that were created and shows aspects from many different and unique characters.<br /><br />Can't wait to pass these on to my nephew and watch them with him.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|It will run for a few hours and quit.  We sent the first one back and they sent us another one.  It ran for eight hours and quit.  I really like the band and the watch but I tried two of them (birthday gift for my husband) and one of them ran for 17 hours.  There seems to be something wrong with this particular watch.  My husband is a big fan of Seiko watches but after trying twice, he asked me not to get him another one.  He said he will just keep his old Seiko.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid and enjoyed it. Now I have taken my time to watch all the seasons, and I am glad I did.<br /><br />I can't wait to be able to watch this movie and the seasons with my nephew.
B00957T6X6|5.0|It kept me spellbound. My wife will be glad I finished so I can spend more time with her. Can't wait for book 6
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel about ten years ago, when I was a young teenager in school. I was a big fan of supernatural type fiction and still am today, but what made me love this series was the collision of the early 20th century feel of Ancelstierre and the swords and spells of the Old Kingdom.<br />This combined my love of reading WWII-era literature with supernatural fantasy literature, and Nix's talent made the transition between the two seamless. By initially placing the heroine in a world which the reader could relate to and then throwing her in a whole new world, I didn't feel left behind or confused at any point - the story just fit together like pieces of a puzzle.<br />It was new, and different, to any other type of fantasy world I had ever read about.<br />Garth Nix is a genius; his imagination combined with a fantastic writing talent brought to life characters which I immediately fell in love with. I'd recommend this book to anyone of any age.<br />The world and plot are fantastically engaging and the writing is appropriate for teens as well as being gripping enough for adults too. I'd also recommend the other books in the series!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|his books are always the most interesting reads maybe because their is so much truth that they make u think this could really happen so it makes for a very fast, gotta hurry so i can see how it ends reads. he is my favorite author and he didn't let me down this time either.

B00004XMTJ|1.0|I love CATS the musical and the production itself is amazing, but I have an actual problem with this DVD. I bought it for my parents, both of whom love this musical, specifically because the back of the packaging said it was close captioned and subtitled.  They're older and have a hard time hearing and being able to follow along without captions.<br /><br />However, as soon as they got it and put in the dvd, they discovered that there were no captions options available. They've tried turning on the caption on their tvs and their playstation and everything, but everything to no avail. This dvd is NOT captioned. And, considering this was the sole reason I bought this dvd (they already have a copy, but specifically requested one with captions) I am so incredibly disappointed at the misleading information on the back of the packaging. Here's to hoping Amazon lets me return this opend dvd ;;
B009R659L8|5.0|With all the trimmings that mark her creative storytelling style, MHC has produced yet another great mystery novel.

B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I love sci-fi/fantasy books and film. I don't love this film. I expected more action, creepiness and darkness from the witches and we really didn't see that from this film. I understand that the underlying themes were that the individual can choose between darkness and light and that \\"love conquers all\\" but come on, we could have enjoyed those themes with more witchiness, more trickery and a few more gruesome acts of darkness. Overall, if you are into witchcraft, sci-fi or fantasy, this movie isn't going to give you the level of heebie jeebies that you are looking for.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This is one of my favorite &#34;swords and boards&#34; films.  It covers a range of topics that don't take away from the overall story:  family, honor, loyalty, religion, military tactics, redemption, and so on.  All the while in a tough setting.  By that I mean it is hard to do a film in the Middle East, let alone in the big J, without walking on eggshells all the time, even back when this film was made.<br /><br />Bloom plays the main character well, without dominating the scenes.  And it is nice to see Liam Neeson pop up in minor roles now and then.  I forget the name of the actor that plays the &#34;i'm always right, so hate me&#34; knight, but he plays the &#34;I'm the guy you'll love to hate&#34; role extremely well.  I wish I could remember the name of the leader of the Arabs.  He deserves mention as the wise, honorable leader.  Besides the idiot knight, there is no real &#34;bad guy&#34; in this film, which also makes this film an interesting watch.  Just two opposing beliefs butting head over a plot of land, none better or worse.<br /><br />Rent, Netflix, yes.  Buy, not regrettable if you do.
B008AVXGA2|5.0|These kinds of renewed Fairy Tales stand the test of time. Magic, enchanted trips through paintings, witches, treasure, a the mythical Firebird with special feathers, and the adventures of Alex and Katie... not to forget their special Aunt. There are always important lessons built into such tales. Such stories of adventure, include lessons about cooperation, kindness, supporting others, and much more. I fully recommend this book for reading to children, and children to read.
B005LAII44|4.0|If you have seen the first G.I. Joe film, you shouldn't really have high expectations in the sequel.  Half-ass in, half-ass out, as it were.  Unlike the first, the sequel was plagued by productions issues that delayed the film for months on end, and honestly... the wait was not worth it.<br /><br />Now, don't take me wrong.  The film is worth an afternoon.  Guns, explosions, silly one liners, bad jokes, and more guns.  If you like such films, it is a nice way to waste roughly 2 hours.  But, if you like such films you know you aren't getting much mental engagement or anything resembling character development or story.  It is what it is and doesn't try to be anything else.<br /><br />Now, for my weak point.  I am a sucker for a good sword play sequence and I must say, the scenes between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow are certainly a redeeming quality in this film.  Not the best I have ever seen, but the sword fights (especially the short one in the hallway) are a nice little treat for the eyes.<br /><br />Rent, yes.  Netflix, you bet.  Buy, only if you really want to.
B00CEF014E|5.0|A real page turner. Great twists and a disturbing ending. Couldn't put it down. Definitely worth your time. I can enthusiastically recommend this eBook Novella.
B004SGWYW4|4.0|Mid range zombie anime, with a lot of boobs and butt for attention grabbing.<br /><br />Overall story and character development is weak to light.  Zombie outbreak, kids and adults in school try to survive, a little background and interaction to keep the folks a little more than 2 dimension.  Not the best story ever, but passable for what the series required.  The average person is mostly interested in &#34;person surviving or being eaten by zombies&#34;, so you don't need a lot of info on &#34;generic zombie fodder B&#34; guy, right?<br /><br />As others have said, a lot of the series is stuffed (pun not intended) with shots and exaggerations of boobs and butt shots and events surrounding such things (shower scene much?).  For the most part, you don't really notice it that much.  However, there are some moments where this fixation does drag the events to a crawl, or a dead stop.  That is the thing that bugs me.  I don't mind a little T&A focus here and there, but when you put the story on a shelf for 5 minutes and basically shoot a soft core porn, I can't help but sigh and fast forward.<br /><br />The highlight in the series, in my humble opinion, is the animation quality.  It is some of the best work I have seen around, in this form of animation.  A shocking surprise, when you don't have high hopes for the series overall.  If you can find clips on Youtube and see some of the shots, you'll see what I am talking about.  Very well done work.<br /><br />Rent, sure.  Netflix, also sure.  Buy?  Maybe, highly dependent on your tastes in anime.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Tons of star power and a gripping story fuel this movie.  The movie pulls no punches and has a gritty feel to it that makes for great viewing.  I've seen this move several times now and it doesn't lose appeal.
B0073U2FB2|4.0|Back story?  No need.  In-depth character development?  Why waste the time.  Toss a gathering of random people in a night club and then throw aliens at the planet.  It is a simple plot, and one that can work.<br /><br />And that is what TDH is.  Characters you barely care about, if at all, trying to survive an alien invasion, in Moscow.  For what it is, it is a solid film, because I didn't go into it expecting much in the way of thinking.  I must admit the alien concept is creative.  Invisible balls of death that uses light tentacles to grab you and gives off enough electricity to light up nearby light bulbs, or car alarms.  The CGI work with the baddies alone makes watching worth it.  They did extremely well with the aliens and how they interacted with environment and their prey.  I did not appreciate how they approach the \\"alien sight\\" moments, where you see what/how the aliens see.  Seemed ill-fitting in such a film.<br /><br />Overall, worth a watch.  Rent/Netflix, yes.  Buy, sure but don't expect a classic.
B004UPANAI|4.0|Some will rate this 5 stars just because it has Hugh Jackman in it.  The movie starts out well enough for the first two thirds.  Then it just stops developing and becomes the generic brain dead action flick.  Still a must for Wolvie fans.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|If you can get by the sub-titles (some folks can't and they miss out), this is a funny way to spend an afternoon.<br /><br />3 person film crew stumble across weird guy while they are looking into another project and decide to follow him.  Turns out, he hunts and controls the local troll population for the government.  CGI trolls here and there, a few silly jokes, and thats the film.  It isn't a serious film and never tries to be.  It takes a lot of the old country legends on trolls and has fun with it, from blood of christian men to sunlight to chewing on tires.<br /><br />Worth a rent, fun on Netflix, buy if you find it on sale.
B00886XQO0|5.0|The voice changing feature is quite a bit of fun.  The 5.1 surround is great on the ears.  It wasn't the easiest thing to get use to the amount of buttons on the ear cups.  The construction is great on this and it is very comfortable to wear.  I didn't experience sweaty ear syndrome when wearing this for extended periods of time.  It will be interesting to see how this will work with the Xbox One.  The reported that an adaptor will be coming out in order to make this work.  Considering there is a dongle that attaches to the current 360 controller, I hope that the adaptor for the Xbox One will start allow this to work.  Either way, the Bluetooth feature is fantastic and will allow it to work with the current and future Playstation.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|This film kind of reminds me of the Resident Evil films (the live action ones, not the CGI ones).  By that I mean, if they just avoided the title, it likely would have gone better.  The second you slap a legendary name with such a following as &#34;Evil Dead&#34; on a film, you set the bar so high that most, if not all, hopes of getting out from under that huge shadow are gone.  Most folks cannot get around that hurdle.<br /><br />Name aside, the film isn't horrible.  Simple plot, characters developed just enough to explain their skill sets and why they are there.  Gore and death scenes are decent, though a bit excessive (not a bad thing in such a film).  Sprinkle the usual stupid acts of horror movie characters, like &#34;whats that sound?  I'll check by myself&#34; and you got enough to carry 90 minutes.<br /><br />The ending was anti-climatic.  All that build up, all that work and boom, the fight is over in a blink with a underwhelming death sequence.  The observant viewer might notice the cameo by the big man, Bruce, at the end of the credits, which was a nice chuckle moment for me.<br /><br />Rent, Netflix, but only buy if you really into Horror.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|What a great series.  This was the shortened season that acted as a filler due to the loss of the lead actor of Season 1.  It stands by itself and is gripping in its own right.  You do get involved in the story and characters.  It was great to see Gannicus show up in Season 3 (really 2 of the main story).  I can't wait for the final season to come out on Blu Ray.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I live this album! I didn't expect it to be this good.  I really think this could be rock album of the year.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|So I ignored all the hype when this show first came out.  I picked it up as a digital download in HD.  WOW!  What a great series!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library but I might end up buying it. Anna is in Paris and meets stclair who is cute and funny. She falls for him but he has a girlfriend . I like that the book is romantic but not cheesy. Happy ending is a must
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|If you have watched the first season you know what you are getting yourself into.  I went on a binge watching Season 1 and 2 back-to-back via instant HD streaming.  It's going to be somewhat irritating waiting for Season 3 to drop.  What a great series!
B005HSGB6W|5.0|Do yourself a favor and see what set Stanley Kubrick in motion for one of his best films - then experience the 'missing chapter' which Stanley did not read, and ask yourself if he would have given the film a different conclusion. It has been many years between my readings, and to me the book has lost none of its power. The final chapter removes none of the poignancy of the story, even though it does add a ray of hope at the very end. If this is your second read, no worries. It's still horrorshow.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Its my favorite game to play, I have it on all my devices. From my computer to all three laptops, Ipad and so forth.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Great to watch. The movie had me glued to the television throughout as I didn't want to miss any part of it.
1250007208|5.0|This book really surprised me. I thought it was a great version of a time honored tale.  The story's blend of an Asian/Blade Runner approach had me from the start. Can't wait to read the next books in the series.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|I bought this from best buy because it had a shipping delay when I first looked for it here. I am a big fan of the Withing scale and thought that I would like this. I already own a fitbit which is very similar.I also should mention that I have the slim coach, body media, nike fuelband and striive.I didn't have any connectivity issues like some of the other reviewers. I thought that the pulse was fairly accurate as far as steps. The calorie count was not for an entire day, it must have been additional for activity.  I didn't like the fact that you have to put it in a sleep mode, I always forget (like fitbit).<br /><br />My issue and concern is a very basic one. I lost it repeatedly and would constantly be feeling for it because it kept falling off. It would fall off my waistband every time I brushed up against something, used a bathroom or just my purse hitting it. I had it all of one week. I finally lost it for good with the rubber housing was on my person, but the withings itself had fallen out of the casing. I still have all of my other \\"fitness gadgets\\" so I am pretty responsible and not prone to losing things. It doesn't really matter how much potential a product may have if it has such a simple flaw in design.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|it is a show that one cannot stop watching.  Ordering from Amazon made it easier than hunting for it at stores.
B005651R24|3.0|John Green is a great and amazing writing author with a great collaboration, however not as amazing as some of his other exquisite books.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very nice sleep sounds app.I like that you can combine sounds and change the volume of each. Sounds don't get repetitive like some sleep machines and/or sleep apps. Timer is helpful too so you don't end up running the app all night. Got this for free as an app of the day but would consider paying for it.

B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Finished The Ocean at the End of the Lane: A Novel by Neil Gaiman and gave it 1 star. Not into fantasy but I finished it unhappily
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Just a dab's all you need with this stuff.... One small tube goes so far.... Why it's there when you need it.... Great quality...!!!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Finding Pride by Jill Sanders is well written. Not good or bad but I did find the supporting characters almost stronger than the main ones. The story was very touching and well laid out. A smooth tale overall that I think may read better the second time through for me! Give it a read and see what you think!:)
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Here is Joe Bonamassa at his best, performing with a great backup band and some impressive guests. The sound recording quality is excellent, and the audio appears in all its glory on the Master Audio track of the blu-ray disc. At the high end, the cymbals sizzle, and at the low end, the bass guitar is clear and musical and can be felt as well as heard. It takes three things to make a great concert video: the performance, the recording, and the video. The first two are so good I almost forgot to watch the video, but that's superb too. Everything came together fabulously here. A must-have concert video.
0452273331|5.0|The book is powerful in its thought provoking.  Besides a good novel story line, the book leads the reader to get new insights into his/her own perspectives life, on what kind of person the reader is, on how have been relating to the world around.
B00417HV14|3.0|I won't add to other reviewers' comments on the concert. It is great, 5 stars for the performance. However, the blu-ray gets 1 star. It is nothing but the content of the DVD copied to blu-ray. There is no Master Audio track. It has DTS 5.1 surround, just as the DVD version no doubt does. Also there is no pop-up menu, something really important on a music concert since it is not necessary to watch the scenes in order and many viewers wouldn't want to. I suspect most people buying a blu-ray of a musical performance do so in order to obtain the ultra-high quality audio. Well, it isn't here. I compared this with the blu-ray of the Beacon Theater concert. What a difference! The Beacon Theater recording was done extremely well and transferred perfectly to blu-ray.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I've read all of her books. While I liked this one--it was not my favorite..found it a bit difficult to follow the characters and the order of the story line. Still think she is a fantastic writer.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|I have used the Strengths Finder approach for many years, even back when the company was Selection Research, Inc. The founder, Donald Clifton, had the brilliant insight that each of us has a combination of talents, or strengths, that can match - or fit - our employment choice. For example, there are individuals who are great plumbers and others who are great managers. The strengths necessary for each of these jobs do not necessarily overlap, but each person has a mix of talents that more closely aligns with a vocation where he or she will be happy and successful. Don also realized that employers can benefit greatly by hiring individuals whose mix of talents more closely fit particular positions.<br /><br />Years ago, this assessment was determined via a highly structured phone interview. Now the Strength Finder is available via the internet with the code from this book. (Don't buy a used version of this book. The code can only be used once.)<br /><br />A Team of individuals can benefit most by taking this assessment and then being guided in a discussion by someone who is familiar with Gallup's approach to Human Resources - see two other volumes, \\"First, Break All the Rules\\" and \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths,\\" for a more comprehensive view.<br /><br />Individually, I would recommend the Strengths Finder to anyone who is thinking about changing jobs. You can gain a good deal of insight into the kind of job you'd be good at, and also infer the kind of boss who would make your employment more rewarding.<br /><br />A terrific book - better with a little guidance from a knowledgeable trainer or coach.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a good app for waking up for school on time and so I can have breakfast on time.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Absolutely loved mixing love with slam poetry.  I have always been a fan of this type of poetry and it was great reading a story with slam helping to tell the story.  The only thing that makes me feel weird is it is a student/teacher story...I hate seeing that in stories.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|I have my favorite movies that are relevant like most of us do. Scarface, Platoon, One Flew Over the cuckoo's nest just to name a few. Now having mentioned amazing movies I have to come clean and say that a silly movie that never really made it big is the movie I have watched over and over a zillion times. It's called serendipity. Just something about it that I like and though it's not one of the greats, it's one of mine. Long story short, after all these years of serendipity I have to say it has been replaced. There is a reason that Silver linings got so much buzz. It's addictive! I love it! I will watch it a zillion times just like I did serendipity. Bradley, Jennifer and Robert should have swept the Oscars. Two of them were robbed!
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Great Movie, best I've seen in a long time! Loved everything about it. From the Sci-fi theme, to the romantic storyline that grew stronger as the movie progressed. Great effects and cinematography and the surprising twists and turns had me at the edge of my seat until the end.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|One of the first apps that I installed on my Kindle HD was The Weather Channel.  I loved it!  A short time later there was an upgrade.  I don't care for it at all!  Too many ads at the bottom, it's not clear where to find things...the page is just too busy.  I much prefer the version on my iPhone and rarely use this one on my Kindle.  In fact, I installed a different weather app and am satisfied with it.  Bring back the old version and I'll start using your app again.  Not sure why you felt the need to fix something that wasn't broken.
0064471837|5.0|I read this book first in the 6th grade and had nightmares about the antagonist, I also remember scouring thrift stores with my mom for my own bells to ring.  I've read and re-read this series and I love how not only is this book a gripping fantasy, it also has a strong, realistic female main character, she was my heroine growing up and it's still an adventure every time I read it.  The trilogy is a wonderful addition to any library.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its great and fun and makes u think on what moves and everything like that and like I said its a lot of fun

1439156816|5.0|I teach English composition and literature as my day job.  That being the case, it will come as a surprise to some that I appreciate Stephen King, but I'm not going to let my opinions be tailored by snobs.  King is a fine writer, a master of the craft.  Much of what passes for literary writing these days has lost sight of what King tells us is the fundamental element of telling stories, namely telling stories.  This book is an excellent primer for the aspiring writer and a good reminder for those who have been practicing the art for years.  My own copy is underlined and annotated with my comments and reactions and with notes of key points that I want to come back to again and again.<br /><br />Review by the author of [[ASIN:0983687242 A Draft of Moonlight]]
0307950689|1.0|I have now only read two Dan Brown books: Inferno, and The Lost Symbol.  I saw the first two movies and was interested in the books, so if anything, I had a bias coming into the books toward giving Dan Brown the benefit of the doubt. Tell me a fun story Dan Brown!<br /><br />That being said, The Lost Symbol was terrible.  The writing style was \\"okay,\\" but didn't contribute to how bad the book was; rather, it failed because of (i) poor narrative; (ii) lack of cohesion between primary elements of the story; (iii) lack of character development; and (iv) predictability.<br /><br />The narrative was poor primarily because there were many chapters that did not make sense in relation to the story, or were unnecessarily included. Just one example was early on when Peter is telling his sister Kathrine--who is supposedly a \\"scientist\\"--about how the \\"ancients\\" somehow had knowledge of modern findings in fields such as theoretical physics.  Not only was this entire discussion unnecessary for the plot, it was just factually wrong.  Brown (through his character Peter) supports \\"claims\\" that modern science is merely \\"rediscovering\\" ancient knowledge, supporting these claims on the basis of vagaries and nonsense. For example, Brown (through Peter) explains that ancient mystics purported some notion of \\"extra\\" dimensions of thought, and this was somehow predictive of modern rigorous results from String Theory.  Not only is that plain wrong, demonstrating Brown's lack of understanding, it takes you out of the story because it seems like an argument a child would conceive to explain something he/she doesn't understand.  If Brown had consulted a real scientist, he would have likely dropped the whole \\"Noetic\\" thing, too. It's implausible passages and plot anchors like these that detract so strongly from the story.<br /><br />In the book, the CIA acts as a police force, which, surprisingly, it is not.  This is absurd, and it would have been more believable if the FBI had been substituted for the CIA. Why didn't his editor bring this up?<br /><br />There is also not much in the way of character development.  After so many books, I would expect his Robert Langdon character to be more developed.  I guess not.  Supposedly being a professor at Harvard university, Langdon is surprisingly dimwitted.  He often is the last to \\"get\\" things that he should get straight away.  I see this as a failing on Dan Brown's part; Brown can only write characters as intelligent as he is.<br /><br />Finally, the whole story is predictable early on after only a little thought, and the ending is unsatisfying and \\"amateurish.\\"  It feels like a giant waste of time after Langdon learns what the \\"lost symbol\\" actually is, especially due to its predictability.
1611761808|3.0|This book has many very interesting &#34;stories&#34; in it.  You finish one and move to the next with no thread between what you just read and what you are now reading.  There may be 3 stories before you get to hear about one of the characters in one of the previous stories.  It is also confusing since all the names are foreign  and unfamiliar names, so keeping the characters straight when they return elsewhere in the book is also confusing. Many of the stories done on a one by one basis are very interesting and quite remarkable. It's putting the whole book together that is nearly impossible. Also, you have 3 different narrators so you have to get used to their various accents.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Really an awesome and possibly revolutionary product! Google has done it here! I used it to watch some Youtube, Netflix, etc all wirelessly with my DLP TV, which is not a SmartTV. I also was able to mirror my laptop screen through Chrome to the TV, which was AWESOME. Happy that I got it for 35 bucks before it went on backorder and jacked up in pricing!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has given me an appreciation of America's Got Talent&#34; although she was on the English version of this show in Great Britain.  To find a wonderful singer like this in our commercialized world, where we expect everyone to be beautiful is a great find.  She has God given talent and I'm so glad to be able to listen to her beautiful voice.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Make sure  you have a pen and paper handy to write down clues. I love it and look forward to more levels. Try it you will like it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I found this book boring.  It's a small village with many various different characters, but little too distinguish one from another until you are very deeply into the book.  The ending portion is when the book finally comes to some point about the individual characters.  The most difficult thing about the book is much of it is written in &#34;Cockney&#34;  and many words were half the word with the apostrophe for what the character wasn't saying.  If you are British, this book would probably be more enjoyable. Cockney is not in the dictionary on your Kindle.
B00E5SCOS4|5.0|My favorite album that KT Tunstall has ever done is her [[ASIN:B000IU3XX8 Acoustic Extravaganza]] album.  I just love the rawness of that album.  Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon returns her back to that sound, that level of emotion.  You can feel what she feels in every lyric on this album and is as good as I expected it to be when I heard what kind of record this waa.  I just love how fearless she is.  She makes music exactly how she wants to.  This is a fantastic album.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A co-worker had recommended this book to me.  I thought the premise was very different, and I enjoyed the fact that the lead character was female.<br /><br />This book had everything, action, bloodshed, politics, romance, you name it.  This is a quick read for adults and it's definitely a great book to get young readers hooked.  I bought the trilogy for my cousin who wasn't a fan of reading but within a month he had read the whole trilogy!!

B005NK69ZC|5.0|I felt like Ellen was talking to me even though I was reading an e book. Loved every moment. Very entertaining.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I purchased these for my husband 18 months ago. He liked them, but the right ear piece just stopped working. They were never pulled on, dropped, ect. He was very careful with them because he knew I spend a lot (for a pair of headphones in my opinion) for them. I paid more than what they are being sold for now. I am really disappointed that they didn't last longer for that I paid for them. My Koss have lasted longer, and were cheaper.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|And customer support is not easy to contact.  Took me forever to find an email address and then it took them a week to get back to me.<br /><br />I will say they got my account back up for me but the game crashes happen 2 or 3 times for every time you try to open it, a day.  It is enough to make me tired of playing.  Don't spend money for the pearls like I did.  That way when you get tired of it crashing you can walk away and forget it without a hassle.<br /><br />Update 8-8-2013:<br /><br />I wrote them again regarding the way it crashes--for Kindle users you will find this important:<br /><br />\\"<br />Thank you for contacting us.<br /><br />There is a known issue with Kindle devices needing more resources to run this app. Try closing all other apps before starting Nemo's Reef. If that does not help you will need to wait for the next update, as optimizations will require a new build of the game, thus having to wait for the next update. Unfortunately we can not throw updates out they have to be tested for bugs that can ruin your game play. Hopefully closing the other running apps will fix the issue you are encountering.<br /><br />If you have any additional questions, comments or concerns please do not hesitate to let me know.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Ben<br /><br />Disney Interactive Studios\\"<br /><br />Update 8-12-2013:<br /><br />Here is my last update--all interested should also consider complaining to Amazon because I think most of the problems come from using Kindles--and Kindle Fire HD (which I have btw):<br /><br />I did as requested above.  It didn't work.  The game won't work and even Disney admits that any Kindle product will not work with this in order to continue with the game.  I got to level 34 and that was the end.<br /><br />Only thing Disney will do is allow you to create a new account and they will be willing to transfer your pearls over if you spent money on them for purchase.  Tell me--would you want to get to level 34 (which took 2 1/2 months) just to get to that same level again and have it crash, again?  I didn't.  This is our life folks!  Don't waste time on a video game that doesn't work when you get to the upper levels just to have to start over again?<br /><br />I'm done with it.  I've deleted it and won't spend my money on any Disney created and/or sponsored games.months) just to get to that same level again and have it crash, again?  I didn't.  This is our life folks!

B003O86FMW|5.0|You never want to stop reading!!! Well written and character development is off the charts!! You become so attached to them you want to jump inside the book!!
1400052181|5.0|This is a wonderful book ! The story is Very disturbing about a women who had cancer and they took her cells to study without her permission. It is a story that will really disturb you and make you think.
0064471837|5.0|'Sabriel' is an excellent book, both as one that portrays a dynamic, complex and intriguing female heroine (who nevertheless never fails to be relate-ably human), but also as an introduction to an amazing trilogy (soon to be pentalogy!) of stories from \\"The Old Kingdom\\". This novel takes many traditional tropes found in the in the genre, but plays with them in such a way that the characters and stories within are extremely refreshing and enjoyable. Definitely one of my favourite fantasy books (and series) of all time!<br /><br />The audio-book (as read by Tim Curry) is also well worth checking out... there's nothing better to curl up with on a rainy night.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I read somewhere that the author scrambled to write these last two books and that they were no where as good as the first.  I can not agree with that at all.  Although the first one, The DaVinci Code was excellent, I honestly believe that each book was better than the last.  The suspense in this book far exceeds than that of the other two.  I have to say that these three books are so well written and developed it's unbelievable.  The depth that his research took him is incredible and this does not just extend to the religious part of the book.  The information on the CIA and the research that Kathryn was doing along with the Masons.  These brought a depth to the book that a lot of writers leave blanks in, not in these books though.  I know that I was shocked with the ending....I NEVER saw that coming!  Dan Brown is a writer that tops my lists of favorites and these three books are an example of why.  Don't hesitate to add these to your reading list, they will not disappoint you!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This is one of those rare books you just can't put down. Sanderson did an excellent job finishing the book. Read the whole series this booked capped the story appropriately.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Awesome contemporary spin on classic Sherlock Holmes stories.  Excellent writing, directing, acting and cinematography.  The city of London is showcased beautifully.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Truly a masterpiece with a well thought out ending.  I was taken by surprise at every turn and when I thought I knew what was happening, another twist.
B00BZW5W3W|3.0|Maybe its just me but I've been a fan for years.However this cd was lacking depth. hopefully the next release will be move upbeat.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is a classic and one everyone should read. I just re read it for the 4th time to get ready for the movie release
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|My Granddaughter, who is 2 yr old, loves it. She would watch it 2 times a day if we let her.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The rush is what u really feel! Great animation and great competition. Awesome for youngsters and adults alike! Love it!!!
B006GWO5NE|2.0|The cable is much to short for my needs.  It should be at least another foot long to be covenant.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A wonderful read! I almost can't wait for the next journey...very comforting if you've lost someone close. I highly recommend this book.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|It is very inexpensive and meets my needs.  I did a small modification and it works well.  I does a good job of protecting.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|I watched this movie on TV and I liked a lot, it was funny and appealing to me cause Im still on school. The DVD was in pretty good condition even doe it was used. And the twist ending is very interesting and unexpected. Hope you enjoy like me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not what I expected<br /><br />Some parts wanted to make you stop reading.  I heard so many positive comments.  Maybe that is why
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|you should definitely get this app. COOLEST GRAPHICS AND SMOOTH FEELING.<br />I would give it a infinity if I could
0064471837|5.0|I first read this book over 10 years ago and have re-read it almost every year since then because it has resonated with me so much. Nix's Old Kingdom is a fully-fleshed, 3-dimensional world with unique yet eerie magic, whereby the title character commands necromantic powers through the use of ensorcelled bells. Despite her maturity, mettle and wits, Sabriel's youth and inexperience make her a very real, relatable character when she is thrust - untried and untested - into unfamiliar territory to fight an unknown and deadly enemy for the sake of both her father and her world as she knows it. A gripping plot with every twist and turn and a supporting cast of characters each with their own complexity and depth, make this an absolute must-read for fantasy fans everywhere.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this to keep in my pocket/with my camping gear.  The sharpener provides three points to sharpen a blade with:  The carbide &#34;V&#34; for creating the edge, the ceramic &#34;V&#34; for polishing, and the flip out spike for working with serrated blades.  The spike has a good, solid feel when locked out, which should lessen the possibility of it folding back into the sharpener during use (a potential hazard I was afraid of).  The carbide &#34;V&#34; sharpens my little pocket knife quickly, and using the ceramic &#34;V&#34; after seems to make the edge last a bit longer.<br /><br />My only real complaint would be that, due to the size, I do feel a little leery using it with my thumb so close to the sharpening points.
0811877485|4.0|These wall decals are so cute but, unfortunately, the Caterpillar and Butterfly won't stay stuck to the wall.  They are packaged so that they have developed a crease down the middle of them so they constantly pop off the wall.  All of the other decals have stayed on the wall perfectly. If they could fix the packaging issue, they would be perfect because they are so cute and colorful and really liven up our play space, the kids love them.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|I am a recent fan Of David Garrett, having discovered him right here on amazon!  I love everything he does and needless to say I went a David Garrett shopping spree!  I bought some cds as well as some downloads and 2 concert videos!  This concert dvd is great.  Now I can see him whenever I want. Just love watching him play.  Don't know if I'll ever be able to see him live so this is the next best thing.  The quality of the video is good as well as the sound.  Not sure if there are different versions of the dvd as mine is in english.  I've seen some reviews where they say there's is in german.  Am looking forward to new music from him.  I love everything I've bought.  Beautiful music from a beautiful man!!!  I must say his band is great also.  Thank you.
B008MM9630|3.0|Fun but, needs some bugs worked out.<br /><br />'re starts a lot so you have start over anything you just done or if you win something it's gone.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I enjoyed the different stories this book uncovered and how the author tied them all together under the theme of success deriving from an opportunity rather than just from talent. The stories the author tells are interesting and the similarities the author uncovers between the variety of stories is intriguing. Definitely a great read!
B0024FAG4Y|5.0|This is a well acted based on a true story that is exciting, as well as informative. I would watch it again.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|love the hidden object games and the mini puzzles are a plus. the people are a little creepy. one guy looked familiar (lol). love the fact you can skip the dialogue. now let me get back to the game.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedlys easy to setup and use. I especially like how you flip the screen to close it and return to the main app. Skipping to the website and returning is a breeze.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|love that I can use my phones camera and transfer all my photos to kindle (and vice versa) with a touch of a button. seeing my photos so large and clear!!!! no need to use computer to transfer them. app works flawlessly. great for us kindle users who don't have camera on tablet. also saves the photos sent to me via email. will be sad if I ever use all 5GB.
0399255370|5.0|I bought this book for a little 4 year old family friend who is headed to his first day of pre-school.  I read it to my own daughter before wrapping it and it is HILARIOUS!!  Very creative and a riot.  Great gift idea for back-to-school!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is an awesome fun game I am a girl and it is fun it is not a boy game girls should play
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My baby loves this paci as she has a friend in the crib with her. It's so cute bc we watch her pet the monkey while she's soothing herself to sleep. We love it bc it's big enough for her to find in the crib and she can place it into her mouth herself... We don't have to wake up as often to put the paci back in her mouth. We ended up buying 2 to have 'back-up' monkey when we have to clean one etc. I highly recommend this product.
B007N3GZ9C|3.0|Link to my review: [...]<br /><br />Review's Text:<br />My rating: 3 of 5 stars<br /><br />Jill Taylor not only suffers a stroke, but is excited about it. Being a brain surgeon allowed her to have a unique perspective on this horrifying event. This tells about her way of working back to who she used to be with just a few changes.<br /><br />This book seems to be aimed at older readers. However, I think some readers might enjoy it because it might help them understand some aspects of their family's lives. Having a loved one experience a stroke is terrifying, but reading about someone who was able to survive and change their life might be inspirational.<br /><br />This book inspired me to explore more into Alzheimer's, which my grandparents suffered from. It was interesting to look at how different parts of the brain function and how it all works together. It was moving and I think many would enjoy reading this book.<br /><br />View all my reviews<br /><br />What I Want to Add:<br /><br />I had read this book during my freshman year of college.  I had enjoyed it quite a bit.  The reason for a semi-low rating is that the book did not have a long lasting impression on me.  It was well written and interesting... I just do not remember it well.  To me, that is a bad sign for the book.<br /><br />With that being said, I do want to say that I liked the book and that it was a unique perspective.  Perhaps I need to sit down and re-read this book and will have a more positive response.  However, I have far too many books that deserve a first read.<br /><br />I would recommend this for young adults and older.  I vaguely remember some terminology that might be confusing for younger reader.<br /><br />My rating: 3/5 stars<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Taylor<br /><br />Have questions, requests, etc.?  Feel free to message me at taylorreadingblog23@yahoo.com
0399246665|1.0|It's hard to tell from the web-site but these books are split so that you can mix and match the pics. I didn't like tho at all and disappointed that it wasn't shown on the web-site. I've returned it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to be honest, I have not read these books (Thank Goodness) but am, in fact reviewing the reviews which are FABULOUS!! I'm certain that I'm getting far more enjoyment reading all these fabulously entertaining reviews than I ever could have by wasting $9.99 on this book. Let me state that I am so very sorry for the pain and suffering all these poor readers had to endure by reading this crap, but wow - what truly fabulous reading your pain and suffering produced! (Please tell me someone is/has started a blog or facebook page wholly dedicated to these entertaining reviews?)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, very fun. Addicting. Great way to pass the time. One of the best out there. Reminds me of subway surfers.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Not easy to use.  Hard to navigate.  Crashes a lot.  I am dumping it and getting something different.. . .
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the best Bond movies ever made. Definitely has taken the place of Casino Royale for me with Daniel Craig helming the role of James Bond. A definitive improvement from Quantum of Solace. Javier Bardem shines as the villain of the movie. Definitively in my top 5 along with Casino Royale, Goldeneye, Dr. No, and Goldfinger.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is quite fun, and not easy to put down! Great for adults and kids alike. It's always a challenge to see if you can beat your own score.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It started out good in a federal prison camp, but the plot got lost at some point. There were way too many money exchanges, fake passports, etc. Just ok.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Fantastic story ....as always. Definitely glad I didn't miss this one. Explains a lot. Great job Mr Child....Great series..Great writing...Great experience.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|Any time i try to video tape or take a picture it freses it makes me mad donloaded for nothing
1400049628|5.0|The first thing everyone should know about this book is that IT IS NOT A NOVEL.  It is a guide on how to survive a zombie attack, and a very useful one at that.  I found it interesting, funny, and just slightly scary.  I though it was very well written, and look forward to reading WWZ.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|For sure it's not the sunday morning  movie, but, if you like real cinema, it will take you to inner places you almost forgot about yourself. Plus, visually it's a priceless jewel.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is one of my daughters favorites movies.  She has played this DVD over and over again. I am planning to buy more movies soon. It came on time and in good condition.
B00D5CENXA|5.0|Great, short story that tells a tale of true love conquering all. Almost a model for a \\"movie of the week\\", this book in a twenty minute read tells the compelling story of an abused wife and the man she is supposed to be with. Every sentence counts, every word builds the plot and it was a compelling, fast read that can be squeezed in anywhere for a harried mother, commuting train passenger or worker's lunch break.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Loved it and couldn't put it down. Saw the movie first which is not usually how I do it. The book was better than the movie although the movie was a good adaptation of the book. And the leads were perfect. The book just gives a lot more detail and both are really stand alone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i absolutely love this series..the character development is intriguing and the twists and turns are great fun, and very sad at the same time. Youcan sense how things are changing all around them, while they try to hold on to the &#34;old ways&#34;.Maggie Smith is so very good, she delivers her performance with a tongue in her cheek, and is flawless.  i LOVE  this series, and have recommended to friends.
B00008MLSH|3.0|The selection seems to be alright. However mediocre CD sound quality is not what I was expecting. You hear her voice but the instruments are not well defined/recorded where you can not follow instruments and stage them properly. Sound detail of instruments playing music is not well presented. I am kind of disappointed of this product quality specially coming from Deutsche Grammophon.
B008OOYALE|3.0|...but you really have to babysit it, which for a &#34;raise your pets&#34; sort of game, I guess it makes sense.  I was never a fan of the Tamagotchi's, so this wasn't a good fit for me.  The dragons are super cute, though, so I guess that's part of the draw.  It had potential, but leveling the dragons seemed to go rather slowly and there's wasn't much to do with them early on.  I lost interest and the pretty graphics wasn't enough to keep me.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|A little on the dark side but great performance by Heath.  Christian Bale is a great Batman.  Best so far.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Works great. Helps me kill time. Would have paid for it if I hadn't gotten it for free from the free app of the day!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Paid almost $80 for case. is coming apart filled out claim. there response, to old for them to do anything sent me to there spare parts sight with no discount not willing to pay $40 for another cover. I have spent $400 on there products. They are not willing to stand behind or assist with issues regarding there product, unless they cannot get out of it
B0061S0A64|5.0|The app is exactly what I hoped it would be and delivers on what it says it does.  It's nice to unwind with and on long train trips.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Once I understood the basics of how to play this game,  I quickly realized two things:<br /><br /> 1.  The game includes additional In-App Purchases!<br /> 2.  I could easily play AND advance WITHOUT spending any of my own money!<br /><br />If you take your time to learn how to play this game correctly, you can play for a long time. You'll even have access to play all of G5's new updates, absolutely free!  It only takes getting to know the game, then developing a strategic plan; carefully calculating your moves in order to gain as many extra coins, crystals & energy, tools, as well as collecting talisman, of which will prove to be invaluable as you move along in the game. If you truly would like to ad advance and discover all the wonderful tthings this game has to offer, one must be willing to learn how to & exactly when to, use items or, exactly when to conserve them! Although this is critical for any further advancement, it is not at all difficult to do.<br /><br />PATIENCE is important. If you should happen to run out of coins, energy and/or crystals; depending upon where you are in the game, goals you have achieved or items you may have already collected; you'll be \\"Rewarded\\" with more over a period of time....for free! So, if you don't mind waiting in order to continue playing but you don't want or don't have the real cash to spend, then....simply wait it out a little while (about an hour) and you'll receive enough to be able to get back into the game to play a little more.<br /><br />I've been playing this game since the day of its release and have not had to spend any money at all. I've only had to wait for a little over an hour to receive more coins to continue playing & that was in the very beginning of the game. Now, that I know more on how to play the game, I haven't had to wait at all.  The Secret Society: Hidden Mystery has an addictive quality to it. I've had a VERY hard time putting it down!<br />Those of you who love the Hidden Object genre will likely enjoy this. There are several opportunities to play both the picture & silhouette-type of hidden objects. For those of you who enjoy the Mini-Puzzles & Point & Click genre, you too, will likely have fun playing this game as well!<br /><br />I highly recommend this one to anyone who enjoys playing either HO or PAC genres. The game is practically un-ending; with G5's occasional, free updates. And, there is LOTS of replayability! All of this for free!

Here you'll find 6 randomly chosen players you can invite to be added as a friend. If they accept, you'll be notified. The more friends you have, the more gifts and help you give by 'visiting' them, the better! Why is it better?

B005ETA5K2|1.0|If you have linux, and you expect to do anything \\"linux-y\\" stop right there.<br /><br />This is a fantastic card for Windows ONLY.<br /><br />Ignore all those Linux walkthroughs you'll see for the NHR. The NHR hates you and wants your linux rig to die. Pure frustration followed by much ice-cream and crying.<br /><br />Needing Compact Drivers in linux for a card that's been on the market several years now means this card is rubbish.
B004OEMRGI|5.0|I don't know where my copy went but I miss it and love this guy's groove.  One of those albums I could listen to all day.
B0086VWCPG|4.0|I used this app to keep track of all my runs and it works great. I like that I can listen to music and it get information about my run (distance, calories, pace, etc.) every mile.

6304795254|5.0|This is my favorite suspense movie, quite a spin at the end. I ordered this and it arrived very quickly and a great price!!
1416914285|4.0|I know that a lot of people are giving C. Clare a hard time - for plagiarizing, for having flat characters, for being predictable, etc, etc, etc. However, a lot of these people had previously read her fanfiction and seemed to have a problem with her copying other writer's work and putting them into those stories. Unfortunately, the majority of fanfiction writers do this. Having been an avid reader of fanfiction for quite some time, it's easy enough to know. That being said, I had NOT read any of those stories before beginning this series about a week ago. I started reading this series with no previous notions of Clare's writing style, characterizations or world building skills. And I have to say, I enjoyed this entire series a lot; I read the first four books in less than a week, and have purchased the fifth. I didn't want to read them at first because I thought they looked stupid. When I heard the movie was coming out in a few weeks, I decided to buy the first and read it, since I hate seeing movies based off books when I haven't read the book. And I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Many people have pointed out similarities between this world and Harry Potter. Well, yes, those are there if you look for them. And now that multiple people have pointed that out - I DO see it. But was that what I was thinking when I read the books? Was I sitting there thinking, \\"Oh, well that definitely came from HP.\\" No, I was enjoying them for what they are. If you compare every book you read to Harry Potter, you need to get a life because those books stole quite a few ideas from earlier fantasy books as well. There's only a limited number of original ideas out there, and you can't expect every writer to come up with a brilliant one for new every series. None of Clare's supernatural creatures are new, but with the supernatural being so popular these days, how could you?<br /><br />The story is fast paced and entertaining. The reviews on the back of the book (which are admittedly biased, since they aren't going to put bad reviews on the book cover itself) claim that the book draws you in and makes you want to finish the book. That is absolutely true. The writing is not the best, but again, this is YA literature from an author who started out as a fanfiction writer, not a professor with a degree in English Literature and Linguistics. I didn't find the characters boring and flat - they aren't the best characterized out there, no, but I wasn't expecting them to be either. Clary and Jace in particular seem to get a lot of flack for either being too perfect or too one dimensional. They're not complex mystery people, no, but in my experience, very few teenagers are. And for those people claiming Clary is vapid - did you read Twilight? Bella is by far a worse heroine, so flat and dull that the satirist website The Oatmeal just calls her \\"Pants\\". And I agree. At least Clary has some definite stances and beliefs. And I found Jace to be far more believable and real than a lot of other male romantic interests. At least he had some demons and clearly isn't perfect.<br /><br />A good thing about this book is that you won't want to put it down. Another is that it's set in the author's clearly beloved hometown. I liked that because it really made me feel like I was in NYC. She clearly knew the places she was describing. The bad things? Well, it is very fast paced. The first book takes place over the span of a week. Another is that she had a big opportunity to really emphasize the psychological struggles a lot of the characters go through, and I don't think she accomplishes it well. It is also quite predictable, as is the norm for YA fiction. In fact, show me one that ISN'T predictable, and I'd be surprised.<br /><br />I would suggest just buying the book and reading it if you are really interested enough to spend all the time reading these reviews. It's a good read. It's not my favorite series, but I was drawn in enough to read four out of the five available inunder a week, which is saying something. And just so you know, a bunch of people giving this book flack (not all, but some) say Twilight is better, which actually made me laugh out loud. This book isn't even comparable to that garbage - well, they do both have vampires and werewolves. Give it a chance! I'm certainly glad I did.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoy this game. My kids like this game also. Keeps them busy. They enjoy having the challenges. I play this when I have free time and when at appointments.

B007N6NGYG|4.0|Trying to get the trains home can be tricky, that's the fun of it. Good graphics and concept. Looks very nice on my Kindle Fire. No bugs found.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Once I get to a higher level even if I complete a level I still can't go to a higher one.  Just not happy.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|This film has plenty of action, but was much darker in content than the previous films in the Die Hard series. I think that the &#34;John McLane &#34; family was never fully explained w/ only a photo of his children in the first film.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It does exactly what it claims, except that if your phone's a little out of date and takes a few hiccups you're left with programming on rails without the ability to change.
1490313370|5.0|One of the best books on motivation, and self help that I have ever read.If you're starting a business , or struggling to expand your business you must read James Altucher.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an amazing game!!!! I cant have a real horse so this is the next best thing. It is so realistic. It like you really have one. This game is so easy but also so much fun. I highly recommend this app for all ages.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book. Much better than 50 shades and all the 50 shades copy cats. Love love love love.
0780772318|5.0|This is the first Garth Nix book I ever read.  It was tucked away in my high school library.  The cover intrigued me at the time and still does.  I borrowed the book and was swept away into an amazing story about a girl and her bells.  Each one giving her the power to send others to the seven levels of the dead.  They gave her the power to go there as well, but danger lurked at every corner.  The idea of necromancy wasn't something I had looked into until reading this book.  After that I was hooked and it wasn't long before my entire study hall was hooked as well.  This a book worth reading.  Nix is an amazing writer who give you every detail you need to feel like your in the book experiencing everything just like the characters.<br /><br />Since reading Sabriel I have read every book of Nix's that I could get my hands on.  Garth Nix as earned the right with his books to go on my bookshelf right beside of my Ray Bradbury books.
B00006FI51|1.0|I ordered this along with several other DVDs  This will not play on any DVD player and states something to the effect that it is not a true DVD  It almost looks like it is a &#34;pirated&#34; DVD although I have never seen one. Very disappointed as we had planned a night with the kids and then the DVD would not play. I do not work a schedule that I can get to the post to return easily. It makes me nervous to order any other DVDs.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This movie definitely has a moral to the story.  There is adventure and intrigue and war and I absolutely love it.  I'm so glad I can have both DVD and Blu-ray formats in one box.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This is a awesome game that everybody is using these day I love this game so much I play this everyday I sware I will play this game until I die
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The actors did an amazing job with this movie, but it dragged on. I think a lot of the movie could have been cut.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really like this game, it may be a little additive, and the special items are hard to find. 3 stars
0312430000|5.0|Very informative and interesting. A new way of thinking much needed in today's  lets make everything complex world.  all who are interested in medicine, public health or just wanted to get a glimpse of How the medicine works its a good place to start.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination, but it was definitely a solid B+. Good visual effects, interesting storyline (although it's already been done many times), good acting and direction. I liked that it didn't have a single cheap jump-cut scare scene. Don't expect lots of character development or tearjerker scenes. This is strictly a story-driven movie. In the end, it held my interest for the entire runtime.<br /><br />I'm still glad I held off buying the movie until rental became available. I don't think this one has lots of re-view value.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This games is amazing it makes you think think think. Also makes you think outside the box. It's a fun fun game to play<br /> :)

0375851569|5.0|As I was reading these books to my child I kept getting tongue twisted and losing my reading rhythm. I would not recommend to anyone who loves to laugh, has an imagination, and loves colorful characters. Besides whats with a cat in a hat?&#34; 5 stars
0718178130|4.0|This is a very funny and engaging story that had me hooked from the first page.  Don Tillman is a brilliant academic with Asperger's Syndrome.  He knows he's a little odd and has coped with people's reactions to him all his life.  However, it's now time to get married and his little quirks may pose a problem.  How will he find a wife who'll love him the way he is?  He decides to approach the task scientifically by developing a screening questionnaire to weed out incompatible partners.  All goes to plan until he meets Rosie.  According to his evolutionary worldview, Rosie is totally unsuitable - she smokes, dyes her hair, has trouble keeping to a schedule, and is vegetarian.  The only problem is that all of the best days of his life have involved spending time with Rosie, except for his visit to the Museum of Natural History which still ranks as No. 1.  Could Don Tillman be falling in love?<br /><br />This is a feel-good story with a lot of heart.  Although Don is certainly unusual, we can't help liking him.  Rosie also has her own baggage, as she enlists Don's help in finding her real father.  We see Don break out of his rigid routine as he stops at nothing to get DNA samples from the 30-plus likely father candidates.  But if he changes too much to win Rosie, will he lose some of what makes him original in the first place?<br /><br />Graeme Simsion's writing moves along at a cracking pace, with great dialogue that makes you keep turning the pages.  Although funny, there are also poignant moments as Don starts to wonder if he'll ever really be acceptable.  The main reason I didn't give it five stars is that I prefer books without swearing.  The F-word was used a number of times, though not overdone.  The first occurrence wasn't until about p. 45 and I was hooked by then.  I don't think anything would have been lost by omitting the swearing, but it didn't detract from the overall story.  I still wanted to find out what happened to Rosie and Don.  Sex is also mentioneda number of times, though there are no actual sex scenes.  Indeed, Don's \\"unusual\\" ways of handling romantic situations end up being superior to that of his \\"normal\\" friend Gene.<br /><br />This is a book about accepting those who are different from us, but Simsion does it in a way that doesn't descend into moralising.  It made me laugh, but also made me think.  If you like the TV show, The Big Bang Theory, you'll really enjoy this book.
B00846F1YW|4.0|my only complaint is that the creator often hides objects behind the top tool bar. otherwise it's a good hidden objects mystery.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I have always loved this album which I still have since 1976!  What I remember most is in 1975 when Paul Simon received the award for Album of the Year.  He said, I just want to thank Stevie Wonder for not completing his album this year'... He knew that Stevie would definitely have received 'Album Of The Year'.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good book. Unique method of storytelling.  It plays with the reader's emotions and you question which character  to  love, hate or believe throughout the book. The end leaves you with a &#34;Wow&#34;.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|This CD was inspiring to me in a way that not too many people would understand.  My younger brother who was a worship leader until his death in 2002 was a BIG fan of the Staple singers in the 70's - He used to say (from the time he was in high school until his death) that he was a 'Black woman trapped in a white boy's body'.  He and I were 2 of 6 kids and shared similar abuse - I was soooooooooooooo blessed to be on stage at the Napa, Ca Bottlerock concert this year when Mavis performed and I wish that I had brought our 45 record of the Staple singers to have Mavis sign for me and David's (my brother) wife and kids -  Her performance was by far for me the BEST performance at the concert - Thank you, Mavis and God Bless You!
B004WMKSH2|5.0|In what otherwise would have been the seventh year of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), and his friends Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint, who, at some point, always wears autumn colors complimentary of his ginger-colored hair), and Hermione Granger( a gracefully matured , heart-shaped faced Emma Watson)we find them, courtesy of Director David Yates, beginning to carry out the plan to hunt for and destroy the magical relics, known as horcruxes, which enable Harry's great nemesis, Lord Voldemort(Ralph Fiennes) to maintain  his immortality.<br />  Interestingly, throughout this saga, J.K. Rowling has incorporated many characters of English folklore, including the house elf, Dobby(Toby Jones), and the Hippogriff Buckbeak. It has been noted that artifacts similar to horcruxes, which allow a murderous villain to maintain immortality also figure in Slavic folklore. Professor Rowling is, needless to say, impressively well-read.<br /> Having come a long way from the first film, which was lit in a warm and glowing hues, the late adolescent years of Harry Potter are captured  in darker, sinister, and more shadowy tones.<br /> We begin with the Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour(Bill Nighy) reassuring the British Wizarding world of the strength of the Ministry  despite the tightening of the grip of the Dark Forces.<br />  Former Hogwarts Professor and current Headmaster Severus Snape(Alan Rickman) arrives at Malfoy Manor, the home of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy(Jason Isaacs and Helen McRory), and their son, Draco( Tom Felton), which has been  commandeered  by Voldemort and the Death Eaters to discuss the whereabouts of Harry and their plan to eliminate all non-pureblood wizards. Hoping to cement the loyalty of his followers, including  Death Eater politician Pius Thicknesse(Guy Henry), Voldemort victimizes Hogwarts' former Muggle Studies Professor, Charity Burbage(Carolyn Pickles) whose pleas for aid from her friend Snape go unanswered. Young Draco witnesses this episode with visible sickness and pallor.<br /> In the meantime, Harry has seen his relatives, the Dursleys(Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw and Harry Melling) safely evacuated from their home on Privet Drive, as they are under threat( The unedited version shows Mrs. Dursley's expression of regret over the loss of her sister as she departs); Hermione, enacting her own \\"Witches' Protection Program\\",  erases her Muggle parents' (Ian Kelly, Michelle Finley) memory of her before leaving home, while Ron waits to take action at his now-rebuilt home, The Burrow.<br /> Harry packs his bags and his bird, Hedwig, awaiting his final departure , and in a poignant moment, pausing one last time to inspect the cupboard under the stairs, which was his initial room, and the little soldier figurines that were his only playthings.<br /> Soon the painful memories are replaced with glad tidings as he welcomes his best friends and other members of the Order of the Phoenix into the Dursley's unfurnished living room, including the now-married Lupin and Tonks(David Thewlis, Natalia Tena), Mad-Eye Moody(Brendan Gleeson), Ron's oldest brother, Bill(Domhall Gleeson), whom Harry meets for the first time, and his now-fiancee Fleur de La Coeur(Clemence Poesy), the Weasley Twins(James and Oliver Phelps), Mundungus Fletcher( Andy Linden) on whom Moody keeps a tight reign, Kingsley Shacklebot(George Harris), and Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)besides Ron and Hermione.<br /> Moody informs Harry that  those now in charge of the Ministry no longer have any part in his protection, and that Harry has a trace on him. Despite Harry's protests, Fleur, Ron, Hermione, the twins, and Mundungus  take on Harry's physical persona using polyjuice potion under Moody's supervision, temporarily transforming into Harry's dopplegangers to confuse lurking death eaters, who will hopefully be unable to detect Harry as he transfers to a safehouse--specifically, The Burrow. The journey is almost immediate perilous with two casualties and a serious injury.<br /> After waking from another telling bad dream, a guilt-ridden Harry sets out from  the Burrow with backback in tow, intending to begin the horcrux-finding mission, but Ron reminds him that he will need help and turns him back.<br /> As preparations for Bill and Fleur's wedding get underway there is a sweetly intimate boyfriend-girlfriend moment when Ron's burgeoning kid sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), dressed for the event, seeks assistance in the zipping of her gown, revealing her flawless  porcelain back as Harry gently obliges. The two express their views on the appropriateness of a wedding, \\"given everything that's going on\\" in Ginny's words. Harry reveals he is in agreement with Ron about the matter, whereas his views had ben different shortly before. The young couple kiss although Harry sheepishly departs when George Weasley shows up... Perhaps a little foreshadowing of domestic bliss for our hero?<br /> Scrimgeour appears to execute Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon's) will, in which he bequeathes his delumiator to Ron, a copy of a children's book, \\"The Tales of the Beetle Bard\\" to Hermione, and  the first golden snitch Harry caught in a Quidditch game to Harry, as well as the missing Sword of Griffyndor.<br />  Harry enjoys the wedding, where he is reunited with Luna Lovegood( Evanna Lynch) and introduced to her father, Xenophilius(Rhys Ifans), editor of the newspaper, \\"The Quibbler\\", which unlike its rival, \\"The Daily Prophet\\", supports Harry, who notices a pendant with a mysterious symbol worn by Mr. Lovegood. A chat with 'Prophet' Commentator Elphias Dodge(Peter Cartwight), and the Weasley's aunt Muriel( Matyelok Gibbs) before word comes of the Ministry's fall, Scrimegeour's death, and the approach of the Death Eaters. Harry Ron and Hermione dissapparate, seeking refuge in London. Having planting an extension charm in her small bag, Hermione provides clothes into which they can change. A brief respite in a diner is interrupted by two more Death Eaters.<br />They hide at Grimmauld Place as they had done previously. House elf Kreatur(Timothy Bates) is caught spying on them after they find a fake horcrux, and they learn that Mundungus Fletcher stole the real one. They dispatch him to find Fletcher, and along with Dobby, retrieve him and learn that Dolores Umbridge( Imelda Staunton) now has the real horcrux.<br /> The three launch a James Bond style mission to  break into the Ministry and retrieve the horcrux, involving polyjuice potion, floo  networks, and exiting via commodes. The ministry shows trappings reminiscent of Nazi Germany, with brutal interrogations about wizards' family backgrounds, and an anti-Muggle propaganda machine. Disguised as Official Albert Runcorn (David O' Hara), Harry learns of a hit list of Muggle supporters, where he sees the photos of those he lost and learns that Hermione is targeted.Disguised as Reginald Cattermole(Steffan Rhodie), whose wife Mary(Kate Fleetwood)is under interrogation and Malfalda Hopkirk(Sophie Thompson) , Ron and Hermione manage to claim the horcrux and escape, rescuing Mrs. Cattermole in the process. But Ministry Official Yaxley ( Peter Mullen) nearly captures them.<br /> After treating an injured Ron, Harry and Hermione set up camp in a forest, they spend their days unsuccessfully trying to destroy the locket. When they decide to take turns wearing it, the evil locket brings out depression in Hermione and belligerence in each of the boys. Hermione has an epiphinal moment about an matter concerning the much-need sword of Griffyndor, but as they relocate, tensions between the boys increase, and the insecure Ron  accuses Hermione of preferring Harry to him, and after a near physical fight, in which he dismisses Harry's concern for his family,Ron leaves.<br /> Harry consoles Hermione as they dissapparate to the White Cliffs of Dover. There is a sweet scene of temporary delight in their tent when the two dance to music on the radio, courtesy of the ever-considerate Harry, whotries to bring Hermione out of her funk. They soon visit Harry's birthplace, Godric's Hollow on Christmas Eve, where Hermione sees the mysterious symbol worn by Mr. Lovegood on a churchyard grave, and  a tearful Harry stands before his parents' grave in the film's most poignant scene.<br /> The celebrated wizard authoress Bathilda Bagshot(Hazel Douglas), encounters them outside the church, and they go to the house where Harry's parents were slain . Voldemort's snake Nagini, emerges from Bathilda Bagshot's now immobile corpse to confront the two teens, and Harry is back in battle in his former nursery. Hermione rescues him, taking him to the Forest of Dean, where the sword appears, and Ron returns in time to rescue Harry from drowning in the lake, nearly strangled by the locket, which Ron destroys. The reconciled trio meet with Mr. Lovegood , who, after Hermione narrates an impressively shown tale featuring computerized shadow puppetry, reveals the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, but then forbids his guests to leave explaining that the Dark Lord has kidnapped Luna and will return her if he turns Harry over to him.<br /> Lovegood's plans go awry and the three escape, but are soon caught and taken to Malfoy Manor by snatchers. Belllatrix Lestrange,(Helena Bonham Carter),insists that her nephew, Draco positively identify the temporarily disfigured Harry, but Draco declines. Bellatrix tortures Hermione as Harry and Ron are thrown into the dungeon with Mr. Ollivander, the wandmaker(John Hurt), the goblin Griphhook(Warwick Davis) and Luna.<br /> A battle ensues but the captives are rescued by an old friend with tragic consequences. As a close ally is lovingly lowered into his grave amid sands and tall wind-bent grasses as gentle as his nature, the Dark Lord cracks open another grave to steal the most powerful wand ever made to prepare for the final showdown....
B000L53D4O|5.0|I bought this for my nephew's first bday and he loves it. He wasn't walking yet just standing or would walk with someone holding him but just 3 weeks after he was walking on his own. He finds it very entertaining and gets so excited he runs around the house with it. It's a very sturdy and safe. Some reviews mentioned the wheels weren't safe because they slip but my sisters home has shiny tile and even like that he's never slipped or had an accident so it's safe to use on my account. I definitely recommend it!
B007SGM084|5.0|This is an amazing story. It keeps you going from chapter to chapter and book to book. I think she shod write the series again from Christian's point of view. Turkey amazing!
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Wasn't even funny.  Just two people slaughtering witches, which got old quick.  Save your time and your money; there are MUCH better films out there.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|I am very disappointed with this lastest film; Lots of action; a lot of fighting, punching, chasing, and tons of explosions...They destroyed a whole major city.  But there was no substance. It deserves the rotten tomatoe award I feel that they left the plot on the cutting room floor. This was suppose to be the comeback of the Cobra-Cobra wanting to take over the world and the Joe's the savior of the world. This was horrible, like a two bit dime movie. Wait unitl it comes on t.v. don't waste your money. Better yet buy the comic book and it will do a better job than the director of this film...
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best game ever! my brother and I play this a lot! Best game to play when your in a dark room!!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app worked great for about two weeks, then it would not open. If I could give it a half a star I would.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I'm a recording artist who has had the pleasure and good fortune to record in many great studios.  It's so nice to see a really high quality doc like this about the changes in studios but also the history of studios in this era - as they really were so important to the social connections and the sound quality and experience that made hugely successful and pinnacle albums possible for so many artists.  I must admit that the artists that chose to work at Sound City are all ones I feel are talented and respectful of the studio but also the studio was open to anything - punk, soul, rock, women - I really love this historical look because as someone who didn't and still doesn't love digital recording- the transition is really well documented here. I feel like the interviews with artists like Tom Petty and members of Fleetwood Mac, as well as ownership and managerial backgrounds- are just so helpful to paint a greater picture of the social and historical milieu of the recording industry and its changes as Nirvana came in in the 1990's grunge era.<br />This doc is well done and is not only an educational piece for students who might want to understand the culture of pre-digital recording, but mostly it's fantastic to see what we had and what we might have lost.  That Neve board. Those amazing people and the social connections that breed artistic collaboration.  Digital is different. I love this doc and will watch it multiple times. The peeps participating are real deal artists and good people.  I'd record tomorrow with any of them. Especially the drummers.
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was in my early teens.  I was in a dark place in my life and reading Sabriel really connected me with her and her story.  It literally gave me the boost I needed to continue on a good course.  Then Lireal came out and this character and her story resonated even more with me!  Every book gets better in terms of plot and character definition.  These are not just fun stories (though trust me they are) they are filled with real life experiences that can really connect readers to characters.
0817439390|5.0|I felt like i had a pretty good understanding of aperture, shutter speed, iso, etc, but I really am getting alot out of this book - really recommended for anyone that buys a camera and wants to start taking better pictures.  Well written, easy to understand, just get it.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|So this was another great continuance of the series but it's only half the characters! The next book will have the remaining characters that were missing in the timeline...
0064471837|5.0|The Abhorsen Trilogy is one of my favorite YA series - my paperback set is falling apart from how many times it's been read! The world-building in this book is phenomenal, the magic system is fascinating, and Sabriel is a great role model for young women everywhere.
0316228532|2.0|I read the Harry Potter series well into adulthood, and loved every book. I was excited to see what Rowling would do with adult fiction. This book was just dreary. It's as if every character in Rowling's fictional village were a Dursley. Now, I think the Dursleys were well written and necessary to the Harry Potter series, but you couldn't build an entire book around them. I disliked every character in this book, and I didn't care what happened to any of them. This story contained some good writing, and was obviously well-researched, but the unrelievedly boorish characters ruined it completely. I cannot recommend this book.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie is a little more aimed at people who play video games but is still great for everyone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great story<br />- Heart-warming ending<br />- Hilarious comedy. So much comedy in the entire movie. Also little unnoticed laughs that you can find in the movie. For example I love how the OREO guards chant O-REO. Little things like those that make you laugh.<br />- Funny references. Nesquik Sand, Q-Bert is a homeless character from an unpopular game, all major villains at bad-guy conference. Things like that.<br />- Twist ending. Something I couldn't predict coming. (I had a prediction it just wasn't right.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Vanellope really had some childish humor but some things have to be for the kids.<br />- I wish they spent some time in other video games. They spent the most time in Sugar Rush and Fix-it-Felix. Spent some time in Hero's Duty. And briefly in Pac-Man and the Bartender game. I wish they could have developed a whole world for Pac-Man and used it instead of just a meeting room at the ghost spawn-box.<br /><br />The cons are barely even cons and they don't even take away from the movie. So a great movie in my opinion. Overall rating: 9/10
0380715430|5.0|Great book for learning about language, with a bit of history, as well as insightfully funny observations from Bill Bryson.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I really see very few things to be disappointed in about this movie.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great story<br />- Amazing special effects<br />- Great resemblence to Wizard of Oz (I bet they would have had as much color in the Wizard of Oz as well.)<br />- Humorous at times<br />- Just like in the Wizard of Oz, people in Kansas represented people in Oz.<br />- An overall fun movie to watch<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I didn't like how Oz was portrayed in this movie as a show-off and player.<br />- Definitely not a movie to take little kids too. I jumped in my seat a couple of times.<br />- The ending feels a bit empty at first but it warms up to you.<br /><br />Overall rating: 8/10
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This is a humorous most readable and different story of two most unlikely mutually attracted persons. Will be of particular interest to those readers with obsessive traits.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun. My whole family loves it. It is a great game for both adults and children. I would. highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a family-friendly game.
B0036EH3U2|4.0|Hi, so I don't get this box. So where's season 4.0? This package does not include the first 10 episodes for season 4??!?<br /><br />Please let me know. Thanks.
B005NK69ZC|5.0|I have flipped thru this one and I am again loving her funny outlook on day to day stuff.  She is a talent in her book writing and I am sure that like the other one I will get many laughs and I will be shaking my head in agreement but I am sure it will be a lighthearted fun book to make me grin and can't we all go with some laughter and smiles on our dials.
B002MJV7JA|5.0|I loved it, just want I was looking for. I am very satisfied and very happy about this product, I received it on time. Thank You
B002U3CCF6|4.0|I rather liked this book.  It was slow to start but once I got reading the book grabbed me and I had to keep reading to find out just who did what and why.  I had many different emotions and thoughts thru the book but all in all I must say I enjoyed it very much.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great movie, very authentic to the struggles that alcoholics face. Not appropriate for children. Some nudity and drug use/ drinking.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is a great quick purchase and play.  It should keep you occupied for a week or so, but it's enough fun that you may want to start over as soon as you're finished!  Upgrading your stats is rewarding - and is done in a way that feels completely fair.  No paying extra money for bite-sized pieces of content or small upgrades, unlike many popular games that simply try to leech money from you.  The graphics look intentionally dated, which plays to any nostalgic users, but the gameplay of shuffling tiles around to perform attacks and open locked doors and chests feels modern and responsive.  You'll be surprised how satisfying it feels to get into the groove of this game, and once you reach 10000000 points, you'll feel very proud!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I was looking for the actual game to play on my kindle for free! Please make available in the app store for free please
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I'd heard so many recommendations to watch this movie and I'm so glad I did! It was amazing. I'm glad I had to buy it instead of rent it because I will definitely be watching it again and again.
B00598Y414|5.0|This album just flat-out ROCKS. This is Iron Maiden at the top of their game. A definite must-have for any Maiden fan, as well as metal fans in general. This is one of the all-time great live albums.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|I've seen both the versions of this move.  I like this version better than Tom Sellec (SP)?  Lee Marvin is less of a pretty boy, and seems to fit this part much better.  I'm just a huge fan of Lee Marvin anyway, and he's always good in whatever he is in.
B00138J9HI|5.0|One of the best live albums, PERIOD. If you like Judas Priest - BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW. If you are a fan of other NWOBHM bands and are not familiar with JP, this album will make you a fan. &#34;The Green Manalishi&#34; and &#34;Victim of Changes&#34; alone are worth the price.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have loved this book since high school. As I read it again as an adult some of the parallels drawn really come home for me. There are so many lessons to be learned here and a profound cautionary tale as well.
B00407PNWO|5.0|A schoolboys epic rediscovered. I was riveted to my comfy chair watching an amazing film by fantastic actors of the past, in a beautiful technicolor action story of sword fighting, archery, and kings, of villainous princes and stout fella's, and a sherwood forest of fame. It changed me to a schoolboy again until the very end.

B0090SI582|5.0|This is a awesome movie. just to let people know that this is not the sequel to x-men origins wolverine. it leaves of x-men 3. hugh jackman does great as wolverine like always. in this movie wolverine is asked to go to japan to say goodbye to an old friend who is passing away. but that friend has other plans for wolverine. i'm glad that they did the japan story. I was expecting lady deathstrike to be in it but she wasn't. but the villains in the movie were awesome. wolverine basically gets his butt kicked by a lot of ninjas an a adatatium samurai and a mutant named viper is a big part of the story. like every marvel movie make sure you watch after the credits their is a big surprise. lets just say it leads into the next x-men movie for next year. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do

B00CPTUNBK|5.0|&#34;The very idea of this...My Little Pony without the pony...just...DO NOT WANT!&#34;<br />--Me, the first time I heard about a movie showing the ponies as human.<br /><br />How wrong I was! Equestria Girls, in spite of turning our favorite ponies into humans, keeps all the humor, all the charm and all the fun of the regular FiM series.<br /><br />Of course, this was originally made to run in select theatres, so you already know the production values are through the roof compared to the series. The animation is beautiful. They get so many different angles on the characters that the normal series wouldn't even attempt. The musical numbers are spot on (this from someone who usually can't stand musical numbers). Everything has that layer of polish that just makes it heads and shoulders above the normal series! And it's not like the normal series is too shabby either!<br /><br />I can understand why someone would have reservations about a My Little Pony movie that isn't primarily about ponies. But they are the same characters, just in a new setting. Give it half a chance. If you love FiM, I'd be willing to bet that you'll love this movie too.
0064471837|5.0|A fantastic read about a strong young woman and her journey to save her father, set in a refreshingly original fantasy kingdom, Sabriel comes highly recommended by me for teenagers and adults.<br /><br />I first read Sabriel when I was thirteen, at the recommendation of a friend of my dad's; he knew I liked fantasy fiction about other worlds, about swords and magic, about strong characters and scary monsters, and Sabriel did not disappoint. Nix manages to create a thoroughly original world and a fantastic heroine, along with some brilliant support characters. While some of Nix's ideas build from long used concepts (the magical wall dividing the kingdoms, for example) his personal spin, original concepts and creative flair create a world you'll want to keep reading about in the sequels. Over seven years later, I still come back to this story again and again, with my copy well-read and much loved.<br /><br />Some huge pros for Sabriel:<br />- a fast-paced and interesting quest plotline, written so as to keep you in suspense and desperate to know what happens next<br />- the undead (who doesn't like incredibly creepy warped undead monsters?)<br />- necromancy and reverse-necromancy (it's the Abhorsen's duty to lay those pesky undead to rest)<br />- a thoroughly original magic system that's complicated enough to be believable but never leaves you feeling confused<br />- a clever blend of two worlds divided by a magical wall; Ancelstierre, not unlike 1940s England, where magic only happens near the Wall, and the Old Kingdom, where the undead walk and Charter mages and Free Magic sorcerers abound<br />- a world devoid of sexism/misogyny<br />- a strong, clever and likeable heroine - Sabriel is a lovely thing rarely found in fantasy fiction: a female character who is neither a damsel in distress nor a bland, hardened warrior, but a believable and easy-to-relate-to young woman, who acts realistically in the hard situations she's put in, but does not give up, does not give in, and retains her morals and sense of self throughout.<br />- Mogget, the Abhorsen's tricky and rather intriguing cat-formed companion, who acts as a refreshing voice of sarcasm and wisdom<br />- a fascinating concept for Death with a roman-style river of death<br />- some 1940s-esque soldiers guarding the magical Wall between the ordinary kingdom of Ancelstierre and the magical, undead-riddled and rather more dangerous Old Kingdom, who are really, really tired of your undead rubbish, thank you very much.n, and retains her morals and sense of self throughout.<br />- Mogget, the Abhorsen's tricky and rather intriguing cat-formed companion, who acts as a refreshing voice of sarcasm and wisdom<br />- a fascinating concept for Death with a roman-style river of death<br />- some 1940s-esque soldiers guarding the magical Wall between the ordinary kingdom of Ancelstierre and the magical, undead-riddled and rather more dangerous Old Kingdom, who are really, really tired of your undead rubbish, thank you very much.

For those of you who are gamers, you will see areas in this movie that were inspired by some video games reminiscent of Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider and Splinter Cell...which makes for a kick-ass movie.

B00009P1O0|5.0|Great overlooked album. Someone told me 25 years ago this was a great album but I never listened till now. Revolution Blues is Neil at his 'crunchiest' and alone is worth the purchase; why this doesn't get airplay on classic rock stations is a mystery. Disillusionment is the recurring theme of the album. Classic Neil Young. Five stars.
B00DL479DS|5.0|This is an exquisite new Brian De Palma film. Passion is playful pure cinema, covering De Palma's common themes and visual styles (voyeurism, technology, obsession, manipulation, deception, guilt, beautiful femme fatale's, heightened performances, overt artificiality, deliberate tonal shifts & stylistic flourishes). Whilst the first half of the film plays as a seemingly straightforward corporate drama, replete with corporate backstabbing (with a brilliant, but frankly bonkers Pino Donaggio soft core score). All is not as it seems however, and the second half of the film takes on a completely different direction and moves into the realms of dreams within dreams and German expressionism with a trademark and quite wonderful split screen section involving Mallarmé's/Dubussy's 'Afternoon of the Faun' ballet linking the poem/ballet to a key character and murder of another which tricks you about its timeline. There are images and adverts of the ballet shown prior to this, and the story behind Mallarmé's poem (the awakening of a faun and the faun's encounters with several nymphs in a dreamlike oration) is central to both to the plot of the story & the character & motivations of Isabella. (Donaggio's score too transforms to riff's on Bernard Hermann's dramatic strings).<br /><br />Like so many De Palma films, this gets even better with multiple viewings as you realise and understand more what about what you have and haven't seen, what is and isn't real, & what is a dream or a re-awakening.<br /><br />Elements of other De Palma psychological thrillers (in particular Sisters, Dressed to Kill & Raising Cain) resonate throughout this film. Overall, fantastic fun.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Not much story, too graphic and too long scenes, a tv series type ending, a disappointment after the first 2 books that I enjoyed reading
0143121006|5.0|Subtitled: \\"How the Murder of a Young Englishwoman Haunted the Last Days of Old China,\\" this is a fascinating book.  It starts off with the most charming description of elderly Pekingers taking their caged sparrows for morning walks: \\"All Pekingers, Chinese and foreign, recognized the distinctive sound of these swallows, which were let out of their cages with flutes attached to their tails to go whistling through the morning air, soaring across the forbidden City and the Fox Tower before faithfully returning to their masters.\\"  The story then segues into the graphic description of the 1937 brutal street murder a beautiful young foreigner, Pamela Werner.  The official investigation produces no arrests, eventually explained by the smoke-and-mirrors actions of the British Consul.  But as the case is closed, the girl's father who had once been a suspect becomes the pursuer.  And French's writing at this point is riveting.  Hiring his own detectives, Werner uncovers multiple clues, unending lies, and witnesses.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|I love this album. She is letting everyone know she's growing up and her sound is so different than her Disney sound. I applaud her for that, because people have to realize you have to grow up. While she might be growing up with a different sound, she is still a lady and isn't being overly sexualized. This new album is very catchy, meaning, her songs are worthy of being on repeat over and over again, because they're that great. If you like dance worthy music, Selena certainly aims to please, with many catchy beats, such as \\"B.E.A.T,\\" \\"Birthday,\\" and her latest single \\"Slow Down,\\" \\"Forget Forever,\\" \\"Save the Day,\\" \\"Undercover,\\" and \\"Music Feels Better.\\" She has sultry songs like \\"Stars Dance,\\" the hit \\"Come & Get It,\\" and \\"Nobody Does It Like You.\\" She experiments with sounds like reggae with \\"Like a Champion.\\" She also shows a softer side with \\"Write Your Name,\\" and \\"Love Will Remember.\\" She definitely experiments with other sounds as well, which is a pleasure to my ears. This is her best album to date, and I hope she continues to make great music. I highly recommend this album and I hope you like it as much as I do.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|If you thought \\"Cars\\" was brilliant, then you'll be sure to love their latest animated adventure, \\"Planes!\\"  It's an action-packed comedy featuring Dusty, a small plane with dreams of competing in an around-the-world race.  The only problem is that Dusty is a crop-duster who's afraid of heights!  As you can imagine, this makes it very difficult for Dusty to achieve his dreams.  But, with the help of his best friends and a trained navy fighter plane named Skipper, Dusty finds new hope and inspiration.  KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Molly J, thought that \\"the visual effects in this film are spectacular\\" and at times it feels as if you are flying right alongside Dusty. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Brianna Hope B says, \\"It is a great film. It has hope, adventure and good humor.\\" Their full reviews follow.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna Hope B.<br /><br />This film is too cute, funny and has great animation.<br /><br />Dusty, (Dane Cook-Voice) is a basic crop-dusting plane with big dreams of competing in an aerial race. However he is afraid of heights, yes that's right, heights! In order for him to even get up the nerve to compete and pursue his dreams; he needs the help of his mentor, Skipper, (Stacy Keach-Voice) and his friends.<br /><br />\\"Planes\\" has a good story line and I really like it. It has hope, adventure and good humor with comedians Brad Garrett (Chug-Voice), Sinbad (Roper-Voice) and many more. All the voice actors do a great job portraying their characters. Of course, the 3D animation is spectacular with great detail and lots of lively colors. My favorite scene is when Skipper starts training Dusty and Chug and Dottie (Terri Hatcher-Voice) are talking too loud for Dusty to concentrate. Skipper yells at them to be quiet and they straighten up immediately, but keep talking. This is really funny. My favorite character is Roper, because he says and does the funniest things. He always seems to be rambling about something and is funny.<br /><br />Writer, Jeffrey M. Howard, writes a comedic script that gives kids something to enjoy and feel good about. Another well known comedian voice cast who I enjoyed in this film is Cedric the Entertainer (Leadbottom-Voice).<br />As Walt Disney once said, \\"All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.\\"  I really like this and believe this message is demonstrated throughout the film.<br /><br />I recommend this film for ages 7 to 13. Kids who love Disney animation films will love this one as it is similar to other Disney films. It's also a great film for the family to see although older teens may not be too interested in it.<br /><br />I give \\"Planes\\" 4 out of 5 stars because I would like to see more originality and uniqueness, but overall it is a great film and I really enjoy watching it. I know you will too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Molly J<br /><br />Well folks, Disney's done it again! \\"Planes\\" is truly a heartfelt underdog story that tells the audience to believe in themselves.  There are always plenty of obstacles in life, but if you dig deep, you can find the courage to become whatever you dream of.  In Dusty's case, he dreams of becoming the fastest air racer in the world!  His closest friend is Dottie, a forklift and ace mechanic.  Although she tells Dusty that he isn't built to race and that chasing his dreams is downright dangerous, Dottie always has his back, no matter what he decides.  I love Dottie because she is such a loyal friend to Dusty.  She is strong, super smart and practical.  When anyone messes with her friend, she lets them have it!<br /><br />Skipper is also very protective of Dusty.  He was an ace flier in WWII and chooses to be alone and quiet until Dusty talks him into training him for the race.  He wants to train Dusty hard so that he races well and stays safe.  Skipper finds that he can learn a few things from Dusty, too.<br /><br />The visual effects in the film are spectacular and, being 3D, there are plenty of scenes where the audience feels as if they are flying along with Dusty!  The race takes us to amazing places like India, Europe and Mexico.  The music is great too, combining old favorites with lots of new songs.  Since the racers come from countries all over the world, the music is based on the background of the characters, which includes Italian, Mexican and British music, plus many more types.<br /><br />It's no surprise that the director of Planes, Klay Hall, is an airplane enthusiast.  He started drawing airplanes at an early age and his father and grandfather were both pilots.  The executive producer of \\"Planes,\\" John Lasseter, is a two-time Academy Award-winning director.  He directed huge hits like \\"Toy Story,\\" \\"A Bug's Life,\\" \\"Cars\\" and \\"Cars 2.\\"  The voice-over cast includes such big names as Dane Cook, Stacy Keach, Teri Hatcher, Sinbad, Val Kilmer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.<br /><br />My favorite scene in the film is when El Chupacabra (El Chu), the legendary Mexican racer, sings to a female racer, Rochelle.  El Chu is trying desperately to win her affection but, keeps failing in hilarious ways.<br />I give \\"Planes\\" five out of five stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, although it's fun for whole families to watch together, like mine did!  It comes to theaters Friday, August 9th, so be sure to check it out!<br /><br />Watch the kids' video reviews at kidsfirst.orgf they are flying along with Dusty!

(Somewhat entitled context not everyone will identify but can appreciate and want (!)--glossy homes, cars, kids, housekeepers, neighborhoods, schools--gee don't all 40 year olds live this way?). But it's real if you can get beyond your own social comparison and let it doe its job, which is to provide angst regarding some stages of deterioration of a marriage. Rufus Waignwright and his brother have a excellent song in the film (but it's not on the CD). &#34;The Days That we Die.&#34; Poignant.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|A beautifully written poem-story that reads like a sort of erotic autobiography. Fans of emotional writing or just good contemporary poetry will appreciate the lush language and exquisite wordplay. A literary piece that is quite accessible, 'Revenge of the Orgasm' washes over and lulls the reader like a warm bath. Recommended.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|After hearing the first single, \\"Where Are We Now\\", I figured this would be adult contemporary like the last couple of albums. Bowie saved the real single, \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\" for after the album was released, and for good reason. He's rocking like he hasn't been for 20 years, and I would go so far to say that this is up there with the albums of the '70's. I know some of you will call me naive or stupid or something like that, and maybe it's that I really didn't like the last couple of albums, but it really seems like he knew the Bowie Curse and waited until an odd decade to release this.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know of the Bowie Curse, listen to an album from the '70's or '90's, and then listen to an album from the '80's or '00's. Diamond Dogs and Never Let Me Down, 'nuff said. Although there are songs I like more than others, and I'll press repeat frequently on those songs, there is no song on this album that I ever skip over.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I will have to admit, I wasn't paying attention when this mono box set came out in 2009, and I had never gotten around to buying the stereo box set. I know, what kind of Beatles fan am I :-) Recently I listened to all of my 1987 stereo CDs and was reminded of how bad the audio quality was. The worst offender was my favorite Beatles record, Rubber Soul. The mix is terrible and this is after George Martin remixed it in 1987. Surely the mono mix in this box set would be better.<br /><br />After reading every review on this box set I took the plunge. I have been listening in chronological order and I have just finished listening to both the mono and 1965 stereo mixes of Rubber Soul. The 2009 mono Rubber Soul blows away the 1987 stereo mix and master. Rubber Soul in mono sounds like the record I always wanted to own. However, when listening to the 1965 stereo on the same CD I am truly puzzled. I can't figure out why George Martin felt the need to redo the stereo mix in 1987. To me the 2009 master of the 1965 stereo mix sounds about the same or better. And the 2009 master of the 1965 mix of Help also sounds pretty good. I don't get it.<br /><br />I know there is more to come for me, but I wanted to say that I am already sold on this mono box set. As many have said, the Beatles in mono sound more like a band, and I can agree with one reviewer that thought that the mono mixes sounded more three dimensional. I think the mix of voices and instruments blend better. Believe it or not, I can pick out the instruments better in mono.<br /><br />My second favorite Beatles record; Please, Please, Me; is one of the first four that appeared in mono in the 1987. Overall, these first four 2009 mono masters are smoother, more detailed, and generally sound more like analog than digital - a good thing. The Mono Master CDs with all the mono singles are also improved in both audio quality and mix. Without the hard panning on I Feel Fine and Day Tripper, these two songs sound more coherent. Paperback Writer is much more enjoyable in mono.<br /><br />I still have to finish listening to the rest of this box set, but for my money, this mono box set is the way to go. I already have Let It Be....Naked and I am picking up Abbey Road in stereo - my third favorite Beatles record. Abbey Road was well done in every way. I can't wait to hear Abbey Road re-mastered!<br /><br />For the older stuff, I think by listening to the Beatles in mono you can concentrate on the music without the dated production getting in the way. To each his own though. I would not throw stones at anyone who preferred the stereo re-masters. We are fortunate to have a choice.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I have now gotten through the entire mono box set. My candidate for most improved album is the White Album. I think it is a combination of both the mono mix and the mastering. Some of the songs on the White Album have intentionally distorted instruments and vocals. Other songs are intended to be straight performances. I think the records hang together better in mono and with the better mastering I can better pick out the instances where the Beatles intended a sound to be distorted alongside one that is clear. This of course requires a decent audio system to discern. I have read on audiophile blogs that Jimi Hendrix music is a favorite test for high end systems. It is ironic that it sometimes takes a great audio system to sort out what some may consider noise. The Beatles always wanted be different and one way was in their choices in audio production. Case in point: Listen to the following music recorded at Abbey Road at the same time as the Beatles and with I suspect the same equipment. This Hollies album sparkles with new mastering but also, the original recordings were more straightforward - just a different approach to production.<br />[[ASIN:B00008AWNW Greatest Hits - The Hollies]]

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I was excited when I first found out that Gaiman was writing a book for grown-ups again.  I love his mix of fantasy and darkness and fable.  This book didn't disappoint.  I was a little surprised that the main character was a 7yo boy and I was afraid that it wasn't really going to be that much of an adult book - but by the end I changed my mind and felt I read a book about a child - not a children's book.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's such a short story.  On my kindle it's barely 2700 locations and that's little more than a single day's read.  It went by too fast.  I wanted a full novel and instead it was as novella sized fairy tale.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, but I wanted more, more, more.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This was the best movie that I have seen in a long time.<br />I enjoyed it so much at the theater I bought This movie on Blu-ray.
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|On my Kindle I downloaded for 7 bucks and I deleted most of my games and a ton of pics and still cant download<br />WAY TOO MUCH SPACE<br />I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!
B0032W5H9C|5.0|I watch this movie religiously and it makes me happy every time! It's visually so bright and fun. I could watch this movie everyday! Carey is just purely magic. Would recommend this film to any woman who wants to be inspired or travel to beautiful places.
0143034901|5.0|I found this book to be intriguing to the very last page.  At times, I found it hard to follow but always figured it out.  The mystery, the unlikely characters, the para ells, how people change over the years, I couldn't wait to turn the next page.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun and it keeps my entertain when I'm bored.!! And my niece think it's fun too so another way to keep her busy..
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Whenever there is a book series that is made into a movie or show, I'm disappointed. In this case I started watching the HBO show before I read the books. I must say the books are marvelous as is the show. Martin gives you a fantastic world seen through the eyes of each character. I enjoyed this book so much that it was hard to put it down!
B00E8B1358|4.0|This movie had a lot of action, this is the type of movie that I like.<br />I know that I will watch it again and again.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I have been following W.O.T.E. for about a year now and must say that they are extremely talented and more importantly very entertaining.<br />Their music is easy to get into regardless if you're a metal head or an R&B lover.<br />Trust me, you will NOT be dissapointed!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I really loved this movie because it's not the typical romantic movie but at the same time it is. It's just so real and true, it is what it is. Zooey and Joseph were THE pair to play these parts. They made it sparkle! It goes back and forth between the years that they are together, it's all over the place just like Summer, it just fits! Really anyone would love this movie, watch it and you'll see!
B000929AJQ|5.0|Greatest NIN Album Ever Made. Pretty Hate Machine Is Awesome But Hands Down This Is The Best. The Hand That Feeds, Only, Everyday Is Exactly The Same And Sun Spots Are The Best Tracks :) Plus Marilyn Manson Bassist Plays In It. Great Album, pick It Up You Won't Regret It.
B000IXUOP0|5.0|Are there ANY bad episodes of this show?  I have never seen one!!  Writing and acting talent is second to none!  I was a &#34;late comer&#34; to the NCIS phenomenon...But once I watched my very first episode, I was hopelessly hooked!  Enough said
0064471837|5.0|This book is fantastic. Garth Nix really has a knack for creating a world with characters that inhabit it. The book, completely engaging from beginning to end. As you read it feel's more like a film then a story (which I love). The story never stops, never letting you have time to get bored. I love the themes in the story, and it hits you right in the feels in the end.<br /><br />I use to say that Harry Potter was my favorite books, but Sabriel (along with Lirael and Abhorsen) have replaced that spot and I couldn't be happier.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|So, at my house we love this movie. We saw it in the theater twice. If you are on the fence about the movie...don't be. It is awesome. This review is more about the Blu-Ray itself. If I remember right, there was only one preview, which is nice. The menu is simple. The bonus feature, \\"Through the Looking Glass of Equestria Girls\\" is the same type of thing in every movie...a \\"making of\\". This will be moderately interesting to adult fans and older children who understand that this is a cartoon that human adults create. There are also 2 karaoke songs...which are pretty fun. My daughter loves the music in this show. The \\"Ponify Yourself\\" feature just left me scratching my head! It is kind of like a music video I guess. It is set to one of the songs in the movie and it switches back and forth between scenes from the cartoon and different human girls sitting in front of a mirror with \\"pony\\" makeup on. A girl will have colorful eyeshadow on and some clip-on hair extensions. And kind of look at herself and then wave. And then it will cut back to a movie scene. And that is it. ??? ok, whatever! And then it seems that there is a printable poster that you insert the blu-ray into a computer to access. So, not really impressed with all of that. But not completely disappointed either.<br /><br />The movie itself is well worth the purchase price and to get a blu-ray, dvd, and digital copy is great. I'm attempting to download a digital copy now!
1416550534|4.0|Another great historical fiction read with delicious secrets and mystery from this author!<br /><br />The reader is transported between the 1920s and the late 1990s with most of the narration being that by the book's main character, Grace Bradley, who is 98 years old and living out her final days in a nursing home in Saffron Green, Essex, in the UK. She recounts her memories when asked to consult with a filmaker who is working on a film about an event that Grace witnessed in 1924 - a young poet committed suicide during a party at the summer house where Grace was employed as a ladies maid to Hannah Luxton Hartford, the lady of the manor. Another person was also there at the time of the incident, Emmeline Hartford, who was Hannah's younger sister.<br /><br />Grace recalls her life and times as she records them for her grandson whom she has't seen in a long time. She also befriends and agrees to help Ursula, the film's producer.  Details are important and it is time to set things right - to tell the truth.<br /><br />Grace, age 14, had been sent to work as a housemaid at Riverton Manor in June 1914. Her single mother had also been in service there until she had to leave in disgrace. Grace describes life and times below stairs as a servant in a time long past. She is a keen observer of both the family who live there and of the events of the day (WW I, influenza, social changes) that occur over the course of her service with the Hartfords. She forms a special bond with Hannah, becomes her personal maid and attends her in all personal and private matters. She is a trusted and valuable member of the household. Keeping secrets is what Grace does best. But secrets rarely stay hidden and \\"have a way of making themselves known.\\" And it is a secret that leads to ultimate calamity.<br /><br />The tale Grace tells, and how she recounts her part in it, is absorbing and complex. The shifts back and forth in time engage the reader and kept me from being able to put the book down before I finished. Although somewhat predictable in a particular scenario or two, the conclusion is satisfying and nicely explained.<br /><br />I enjoyed this and plan to read the other books by this author!ore I finished.

B009ARMS1I|1.0|This season was offensive, filled with episodes that didn't move the plot forward, twists that led up to offensive jokes. Inconsistent plot lines, acting that confusing and stories that led nowhere. I don't recommend this season. Very few episodes that were worth watching. Dynamic Duets, Thanksgiving, were exceptions in a mediocre season. A bright spot in the season was Darren Criss' acting, even in the confusing plot lines he was a bright spot. Unfortunately the stories written for him and the rest of the cast were all over the place and confusing. Give me a coherent story glee.
B00CMQX84A|3.0|The movie skips and freezes.  Then it jumps forward and skips a whole scene.  It did it the first time we watched it.

0525478817|5.0|John green is a genius with his books, this is my second time reading the fault in our stars. I am reading it for a project for school, i chose this book because its a touching love story about two teenagers falling in love with their &#34;cancer perks&#34; i recommend this for everyone to read. Not many books have made me cry but this one had me sobbing. IT IS NOT A SAPPY CLICHE TEENAGE LOVE STORY. It actually has emotion in this book. I also recommend &#34;looking for Alaska&#34; which is also by john green or &#34;the perk of being a wallflower&#34; by Stephen Chbosky. i hope you enjoy this book as much as i did.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm not gonna get all technical.  Right now it's in beta stage and Google is requesting no apps be released yet.  But I only say yet.  As an android developer, I can see the true value of this device.<br /><br />This will turn any HD TV in to a Google smart TV.  Stream Netflix and YouTube easily.  Also, stream chrome desktop. And soon stream anything.  This will have many apps for it.<br /><br />I've purchased one for all 3 HDTVs and really look forward to developing some fun and useful apps.  All I'm going to say is buy it, many of my android Dev buddies are already at working delving some fun apps.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|this game looked action pack so I got it for my 5 year old son who now is in love with it and plays whenever he can.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Quick Services and quality product for the money.  I plan to order another one.  My daughter had recommended this to me. I am glad she did.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|If your like me... you know you played Uno aaaaallllllll the time growing up. But, if indeed you are like me and the youngest in a family, there is no one else to play with you. This solves all problems. I am in love
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the most awesome games I've yet to of played. Always love mind boggling games like this that keep you thinking on your toes.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I congratulate who had the idea of making this movie. Witnessing Hitchcock at work is a privilege, even if it is pretend. Anthony Hopkins was so good that I almost didn't notice him. Only once in a while, on a very rare occasions, Hopkins displayed a gesture or said something in a tone of voice that reminded me that Hopkins was behind that mask. It was very subtle, almost unnoticeable.<br /><br />My only criticism is the scenes with the dialog between Hitchcock and his super-ego. It's just that it became commonplace on biographical pictures.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and cute game taking care of your own horse, feeding and loving it! I always wanted my own horse haha
B00A285OOW|5.0|I hated for it to end, I have read all five over the last few weeks, I was a fan already.<br />Looking forward to the next book. I could not put it down.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Buyer was great and Sons is the best series I've ever watched!!! I've watched all the seasons and will continue to buy them when they come out for sale.
0312360266|1.0|Bought all the books because I loved the first book, I just got more and more bored with the series as it got more into the storyline, I didn't even finish the last 2 books. its the same with my friends they borrowed the books off me but got so tired of reading the last book or so. didn't keep me entertained through out.. but if you like this book, try vampire academy!!! that IS an amazing story and great story line. I was blown away by vampire academy.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This has always been my absolute favorite Oscar Wilde book. It's well written, suspenseful, and filled with life's moral dilemmas. What more could one ask for from such a prolific and fantastic author? It's truly a little gem of a book which gets better over multiple readings! Enjoy!
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel, a young woman in the prime of her life, has to give up childish fantasies to save the world from the dead. With courage and honour, she leaves the place she knows and crosses the Wall, into a world she doesn't know but can somehow remember. Her father, one of the bloodline of Abhorsens, magicians who blend a mix of dark and light to fight off evil, dies and leaves her his legacy - To carry on as Abhorsen. Driven by fear, a hunger to know herself and the strength of her bloodlines, Sabriel fights the truest evils of the earth. In a world where Death threatens the living, Sabriel treks back to her home, Ancelstierre, to save the people she loves from the certain doom of Kerrigor. She is not alone in her burden, accompanied by a free-magic construct who takes the form of a cat, Mogget, and Touchstone, a man she saved from a 200-year imprisonment, the trio battle Kerrigor together. Faced with near-death and love, Sabriel conquers over evil and learns her place in the worlds of Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom, bringing the two together to fight the foe like never before.<br /><br />This book had me yearning for more and I immediately picked up Lirael and read swiftly to Abhorsen. The nearing release of Clariel has my fingers, eyes and Old Kingdom bones itching for more.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful talent and for inspiring an amateur writer like me, Garth Nix. You truly are a master.
B008J34466|5.0|I love P!NK. I think she is a strong role model for girls out there. She has consistently refused to bend to the pressure put on her by the record companies and you can tell that she is only willing to put music out there that she is proud of..<br />I generally buy whole albums from her, because there is rarely a song that I just hate that comes from her, but this is the first album I've bought of her's that is amazing on every song. She isn't afraid to speak her mind and put herself and her life out there in her music, and you can tell.<br />This album cover topics from her rocky (but reconciled) relationship with her husband, to fun party anthems, to ballads about lost loved ones, and those fighting against depression and suicidal thoughts. I have personally really connected with several of the songs on the album, especially the ballad &#34;Beam Me Up&#34; that talks about getting just a minute of time to talk with someone who has passed over. As someone who fairly recently lost my mother and sister, there are many times that I wish they could just &#34;Beam Me Up&#34; to heaven to speak to them just one more time.<br />Also, I've seen some reviews dealing with the profanity that is found in some of the songs, if you prefer to avoid the profanity, then there is also and edited version of this album available to download. Personally I chose to purchase the unedited versions, but I'm not against the edited ones either. I don't feel that  the editing process looses anything of core value in the songs. So, go buy the album, crank up the music, and ROCK ON!
096798467X|4.0|great read, author is very community oriented evidenced by stories and group photos. would have liked suggestions for alternative materials as foraged brick and block are very cost effective as well as the use of Quickkrete in place of home mixed adobe; i am unwilling to mix 5 gallons of clay to test -seems too difficult when there are easier and just as strong mortars around. i make just about everything homemade around my place and i think i'll use my imagination and some suggestions from the book; i'm looking for something a little larger and more aesthetically pleasing.<br /><br />all in all, if you want to build your oven completely from scratch, this is the book for you
B008FPOIT6|5.0|What a fun book to read! It's contemporary and old at the same time. It values books and technology almost equally. It feels like it is about today, but it has tons of allusions to lots of books, movies, events, and politics of yesteryear. No matter the age of the reader, they will find an area of interest. Best of all is simply the way Sloan writes: The neatest phrases come out of the narrator's mouth. The metaphors are usually surprising but totally apt. Enjoy a few hours of entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Could not put it down. Lots of concentration. Will keep the mind working. Can't wait for more rooms. Lots of fun.
1594746036|4.0|I enjoyed this book greatly. It contains a lot of mystery and a lot of questions. The only precaution I would point out is that the ending of the story could leave the reader waiting for more, which may be a good thing if the author continues with the storyline for a future book, or books. The tale is written from the point of view of a boy, which makes the story relatable to anyone, even to male readers. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children also contains a mystery about the people in the book. It is all about finding the truth, and then fighting for a place and home that the characters love. What also made this book enjoyable is that the author found pictures from the past and placed them strategically throughout the book. It makes the story and the people seem even more realistic and what happens in the book a possibility, for readers who have a good imagination.<br />  I think anyone can find something in this book to enjoy. There is mystery and a little bit of peculiarity to the tale. It can make any reader stop and think and the tale can truly take the reader to a new land.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|On zen mode I played for hours without being able to die. Got bored and quit the game. I probably won't play it again. It would be a good game to play in the background while watching reruns of Law &amp; Order or something.<br /><br />Game quality and music are fine. Made for a good FAOTD, but it's not worth $1.99. At any price I'd have regretted the purchase to be honest.I really like puzzlers or &quot;Tetris-like-in-a-puzzley-way&quot; (think Adventures of Lolo on NES), but this one isn't for me.
1416955070|1.0|I just found the heroine incredibly unlikeable with her self proclaimed shyness and geekiness.Going to a nightclub when youre shy is pretty strange.Not to mention that the writing and plot left a lot to desire.<br /><br />When I read a book I like to be shown things not jus told.You would do better to skip this one.
B00021HBGS|2.0|I got these for my 2 year old twins. The concept is cute and they like looking and playing with the pieces. However, the roads do not stick to the tub or the tiles. I have to keep putting them up over and over and they either fall or slide right down. I get so frustrated, since I read all the great reviews on this product. My twins love them, though, and learn a lot from them. All they can actually do with them is hold the pieces, not play with them on the wall. As far as being functional and working as advertised, they dont for us. It is such a great idea though, that I wish they worked!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is the first time I've read this book.  Only thing I can say is that it was wonderful.  I laughed and cried.  I was so taken by this entire family that I couldn't hardly put it down.  Just can't believe it's taken me this long to finally read it!
0345803507|5.0|Read the book online but wanted an actual hard copy of it because my mom wanted to borrow it and didn't know how to use technology. So I reread it and borrowed it to her. Loved being able to have it right in my hand and not wear the battery of my IPAD down and not borrow the IPAD to my mom. Love the book and story.
0547258305|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. It contains adventure and struggle and questions and doubts. Something that every person can relate to. Although there were points that could be considered long and drawn out, while I was reading I did not believe that it was too much. I felt attached to the characters and find myself worried and surprised and results in the story. Often, surprises are hard to come by in books because stories can all seem the same. The main character is a strong female and although that might turn some males readers off from the book, I think the adventure and fighting that happen in the book can be entertaining and enjoyable to male readers, while giving them a different perspective. The ending of the book seems rushed, and though this can be a criticism, at the same time I feel that the ending did justice to the book. If the ending had happened in any other way, I think the story would have become boring and drawn out. Although the summary implies that there is some sort of magic in the book if you read it considering Graces as something that people can work on, although not necessarily \\"normal\\" gifts it can be seen as simply talent.<br /><br />  Other websites and book sites have stated that this book is part of a trilogy. I have started reading the second book in what GoodReads calls the \\"Graceling Realm\\" series, and as of now I can say that although there are a few characters that are the stories do not need to be read together for a reader to understand what is going on. So, if a reader is hesitant about starting a series because they can seem tedious, this is one series where I can say that if you read one (although I started the second because I enjoyed the first so much) you do not have to read another, you can stop at one book or two or all three.
0743289684|4.0|It amazes me how so many Muslim women &#34;allow&#34; themselves to be treated so badly and as substandard to men in predominately Muslim countries.  This book tells one woman's story which shows how this treatment is deeply embedded in the generations and continues today due to abuse and exclusion.  Brutal details about female genital mutilation, beatings, and widespread cultural & educational ignorance.
B004NS710C|4.0|Very entertaining. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.Some things are predictable, but I enjoyed it none the less
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|LOVE this movie.  I'm not just saying that because I am a huge Bruce Willis and &#34;Die Hard&#34; fan.  Great drama, comedy, and a little love thrown in.  Gotta love it.  This movie totally ROCKED!!!!!!  Do I sound like a guy?  Anyway, buy it.  Rent it.  Watch it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00CEQ1JOO|3.0|It is unclear why this doll is an inch or two shorter than the rest if the Monster high dolls. My daughters brought it to my attention as they were a bit disappointed by this. I told them maybe she's supposed to be a younger sister. Also quality of these fools is notoriously poor. The hair really can not be combed or styled or it gets all frizzy. I guess little girls are not supposed to do ther hair, as each doll come with a hair style that is stiff and stuck in position. Why the size difference Mattel is this to save money?
0345803493|5.0|Had a digital copy of it but wanted a hard copy because I wanted to not have to wear the battery down. Plus my mom wanted to borrow it once I reread it and she doesn't know technology very well so a book was very good for her.
0385737955|5.0|This book is one of the better dystopian novels that I've read. It has intrigue and mystery and horror and can really grab the reader. Although I believe the book can be tedious for some readers, I think for the most part if a reader enjoys intrigue and other dystopian novels this book should be given a try. I also think this book is a good start for boys to read. It is the first novel in a series, and although a series can seem daunting, I don't think many readers would feel that way about this trilogy.<br /><br />  Written from the point of view of a young boy, the reader can feel as overwhelmed about what is happening in the story as the characters do. After all, neither the reader or the characters completely know what is going on and there are just enough hints to make the reader question the validity and truth behind all that Thomas says.
1576875776|5.0|This book is beautifully printed and presented but it is a great shame that the bar code is printed on the back of the book rather than inside the back cover.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I don't have a TV with WiFi so this enables me to watch Netflix without having to use my Xbox 360; The picture quality is awesome. I cant wait until there's more apps that have the &#34;cast&#34; feature.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fast fun game to play when you have a moment to sit and wait like at a doctor's office. Lots of fun,fun fun!
1594204217|4.0|I've been baking for years. This book taught me to make the crusty European loaf that I thought was impossible to make at home. Hands down, the best bread I have ever made. That said, this is not a recipe book. It is a book of Pollan's discoveries as he learns to cook. A lot of it is very entertaining.
0345803485|5.0|Had a digital copy of it but wanted a hard copy because I wanted to not have to wear the battery down. Plus my mom wanted to borrow it once I reread it and she doesn't know technology very well so a book was very good for her.
0375842209|4.0|This is another book that I truly enjoy. I've read it multiple times, and that is not something I do very often. Although the story can be somewhat confusing to follow it is an interesting take on the narrator, because Death does not seem to have feeling so the reader is more capable of thinking and seeing feelings where they might believe them to be. This story was easy to relate to and is able to make the reader see a more private part to a very large part of history. I believe that this book would mean more to people who enjoy history. However, I believe that any reader can find something to relate to in this book. I recommend it highly, but would also like to warn that it can be slow at some points, so it is necessary to give the book a chance. The Book Thief is also the type of book where the reader needs to pay attention. It is easy to get a little overwhelmed, because of the way it is written.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. It is awesome. And BANANAS!!! Playing with the minions is amazing. And getting to dress up the minions s fin too.<br />:
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|good game gets a  little boring but I always go back to the birds.  It is also fun and challenging
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I love watching phantom of the opera at the Royal Albert Hall. The whole presentation was wonderful. So when purchased Love Never Dies, I truly expected to see (again) Ramin and Sierra in the sequel. I still loved the beautiful songs some were tearjerkers.<br /><br />BUT I was disappointed that Ramin was not in the film.  Neither was Sierra. Why not?!!! It is possible I did not read the names of this new cast, but why not use the same cast that made the first one so great...that would have truly made it a continuation of this love story with all it's passion!!!<br /><br />A true fan: Myra Medina
B0009VSB06|4.0|This is a good metal detector.  It's easy to use.  It's easy to learn how to use.  I used it for the first time today, and found a penny.  I'm not going to  get rich off this probably, but it is good clean fun, and if I'm lucky, I'll find enough coins and stuff so  I can get some metal detector accessories and keep up with the bills.  The few drawbacks I see is that it's not ultra light and if you happen upon something you won't know exactly what it is by the key onscreen.  You have to dig to find out.  The penny I found fell under the key's iron heading, which would be a drawback if you were really a serious detector and looking for a specific thing.
1938469003|5.0|A wonderful guide not only to brew , but to undestand the history of this style! no wonder my first craft beer is going to be an IPA
B004UID2LC|5.0|Love this app! Now able to watch utube videos on my kindle. Also very easy to download them to the kindle for later viewing. Has a handy search feature to find any video. Have had it for several weeks and no issues so far.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is a good game to play when yo are bored and great in the office or with a friends at the park
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was awesome. I just wish it was more about the \\"tent\\" or whatever it was called cause i'm curious about the war and how it started.. but overall I loved the movie.. great film.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Takes some getting used to at the beginning but once you do, you're off and away. Addicting and hard to put down.
B00BG23LYS|5.0|Jus took a chance on it..., guess the bands name apealed to me...glad I DID! B/F sez they remind him of pre 1975 black sabbath with a lot of the same guitar riffs jus sorta changed up to make it there own. What does not<br />sound like sabbath in the ozzy years or even dio  (79 ) is the<br />lead singer..(That You Uncle?) and off hand the closest  sounding might be Led Zep ''Robert Plant'' without the tight pants that seemed to make robert beller like nuts are being strangulated...!<br />Do Not think...buy this as well as the other offering (Purple Cover)..Believe it or not...IMO..,It's better then this one,....Hope this helps..Kaitee
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Another great book from Brandon Sanderson, and another stunning conclusion to a trilogy. I hope he continues to write Mistborn novels, I love the magic system. Cannot wait to get my hand on the Mistborn game.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I thought the book was ok. It gets a little drawn out at some points but I finished it through. It's not a bad quick read but it's definitely NOT a great read.<br /><br />It's a pretty long series and after the first book, I've decided not to continue with the other 5 books. Just not a good time investment.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea but hopefully the movie is better.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Much prefer the previous version!!!  Way too busy, just want the forecast without all the other junk.<br />Not even sure I want to keep the app.
1781162646|5.0|I really loved this King story about a young man who takes a summer job at a Carolina amusement park during the 1970's. No one humanizes a character, makes him real, like Stephen King, and he does it in spades for his main character, Devin Jones. Devin is going through the pains of lost love as he is dumped unceremoniously by his college sweetheart just after starting the job. But the park is just what he needs, and he finds great friends among the other summer hires, and also finds himself in the middle of a mystery. Along the way, King incorporates a good old ghost story.<br /><br />Was it frightening? Not really, not in the sense that most \\"horror\\" novels are, but then again, this isn't a horror novel in every aspect. When a story makes me get a little misty-eyed as I read, I count that as a huge success. I don't know if this book is really \\"better\\", but I enjoyed this book more than the last couple I've read by King.<br /><br />I didn't mind the issue of not having this book available in ebook form.  It's probably a book I will reread at some point, to get into the richness of the story without the urge to find out what happened, and I don't mind having King books on my shelf, so I probably would have gotten it in dead tree form anyway. The fact is that I really liked this book; it really \\"spoke\\" to me...

B009JBZH54|4.0|The entire trilogy makes a lot of sense now. I was a fan of the third movie but watching the first movie makes the 3rd a much better film. The whole series was great. The extras are exciting and entertaining.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Much of the story is fun and interesting, but there are way too many sexual encounters and way to graphic.  It reads like a &#34;How Too&#34; for kinky behavior.
B00004YYDI|5.0|The extended minutes in this version is well worth the purchase price of the DVD.  I first watched this on a TV channel<br />and liked it well enough to purchase the additional minutes.  All four of the main actors are great but for me Natalie<br />Portman's acting makes it a solid gold choice.

B003J27WFW|5.0|I learned alot about this band and got most of their cds after watching this documentary (and Rush in Rio); which is good because my music collection is rather old.  I love their independence and I notice something different each time I listen.  I can't write an insightful critique of their work, only that they stand out in a very competitive industry.

0767919408|3.0|No, Bill Bryson's latest isn't odd or wacky. But just about every character in his book is.<br /><br />In One Summer America 1927, Bryson focuses on individuals and their accomplishments. Nearly every one was not only historically interesting, but downright weird. Charles Lindbergh was anti-social, Calvin Coolidge liked to have his scalp massaged with Vaseline while he ate breakfast, Lou Gehrig was unnaturally devoted to his mother. Of course, this makes for a fun and lively narrative.<br /><br />It's hard to say how much research Bryson did for this book because the review copy doesn't include bibliography or references, and there are few footnotes in the text. But if you are moderately interested in 20th century American history, you'll have come across much of this story before, and possibly recently. He tells the story of [[ASIN:0312429622 Fordlandia]], and [[ASIN:1400078458 The Lost City of Z]], of Babe Ruth and [[ASIN:0743268938 Lou Gehrig]], of [[ASIN:0425170411 Lindbergh]], [[ASIN:B00BDM500O Henry Ford]], and [[ASIN:1416580603 Al Capone]]. There's a large supporting cast as well, and while the bulk of the narrative takes place in the summer of 1927, it's necessary to backtrack occasionally to set up an event that would take place that year.<br /><br />The importance of the summer of 1927, according to Bryson, is that it was the moment when America began to become dominant in the world for the first time. Our influence via movies, sports, war, aviation, and radio was overwhelming and lasting. Of course it's arbitrary to pinpoint a moment of change that precisely, and Bryson no doubt chose the year for its abundance of good stories.<br /><br />As entertaining as the book is, and it is an enjoyable book, I think I was more impressed by the google detours I took while looking for more information. There's a marvelous video on YouTube of the trip some American Legionnaires took to the convention in Paris in 1927. The video has been restored and it's so clear and vibrant, you're almost there yourself. Checking out silent film star Clara Bow's Brooklyn accent led to some clips of her in talkies and she sounds perfectly middle American, not at all like Fran Drescher, which you might conclude from Bryson's telling.<br /><br />Upshot-- Borrow the book and enjoy it at your leisure.vibrant, you're almost there yourself.

0064471837|5.0|This book is amazing. Its one I can return to over and over again. I first heard of the book from a friend who didn't care for it because she thought is was too dark.I couldn't help myself, I had to read it. After I did, I then made my entire family of 8 listen to it on a road trip, including my father who does not care for fantasy and is what you might call a literary snob. Everyone loved it. There are many reasons why this book is an amazing accomplishment but one of the stand out reasons for us was that so many of the fantasy novels out there set up mysterious characters with hidden powers but when it comes time for the big reveal one can't help but feel let down. When you travel through the arc of this story and reach the big reveals it delivers on the scale that was promised. I also think Mr. Nix has a fantastic ability to follow up the climax of the story. I was always completely interested in the epilogue and wanted to know as much about the characters he had made me fall in love with as possible. The themes are also very well done, so much depth was expressed through the different characters' journeys and discoveries. Many of the most ancient concepts of blood, music, power, death, chaos and order are well expressed here. The world that is created in these novels is believable and sucks you in and though it isn't done on the scale of novels like The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, it achieves the same sort of reality and the language style used has the same integrity. It may be a little dark but it is also incredibly hopeful in my opinion. It deals with death, yes, and that is dark I suppose but even if you are the squeamish type these books are worth your time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is tons of fun! Lots of dragons... even limited time ones that you have to work hard to get... or NOT if that doesn't fit your style. Colorful, good in-game music and you can share it all with your friends... or NOT!<br /><br />Have fun!

0064471837|5.0|I just re-read this book for the first time in almost ten years, and loved it as much the second time as I did the first. This book perfectly combines suspense and horror, with just a little touch of romance in there to keep you intrigued. Nix's world building skills are incredible, and he really draws you in to The Old Kingdom and its more modern counterpart of Ancelstierre. The titular character, Sabriel, is an intelligent young woman who, out of the blue one night when expecting her father to show up for a visit, is thrust into a life she feels she is under-prepared for. This book is also an interesting one in that the subject matter involves necromancy, which gives the story a very eerie tone. It allows Nix's to put the character in desperate situations that, as a reader, you are unsure of how they will escape. However, the best part of all, is that this is just book one in an even more incredible series that will keep you up well past your bedtime; half because your dying to see what happens next, and half because your too scared to sleep.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Slower than usual!  A lot of detail that I didn't need to know and found that I was guessing ahead chapter by chapter.

B008MWBY6W|4.0|This is a great bag if you want to take a very light setup with you. It´s light and strong, it protects your camera very well.

B0067RQYNW|5.0|From my Kindle Fire HD, I was only able to access and view my doc files on Dropbox.  I needed to be able to edit them as well.  After some research, I downloaded Quickoffice Pro from Amazon.  It has the same name as the office suite which was recently bought out by Google, but that's where the similarity ended.  I think it's very misleading and Amazon should look into it.  Anyway, I returned it and went back to the drawing board.  This App (Kingsoft Office for Android) does the trick.  I tested it out by easily accessing my doc files on Dropbox through the Kingsoft App.  I was able to edit and save the documents in Dropbox.  To test that the changes were made and saved, I immediately opened Dropbox on my PC.  The changes were already there.<br /><br />  So far, though admittedly with only preliminary usage, this App is doing what I wanted and very easily.<br /><br />  And it was FREE.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is a wonderful game and you should defenitly get it I recommend this game if you like temple run

B002VWOMMM|5.0|one of my top 10 fav movies of all time, Eastwood is simply brilliant. the story and the incredible cast of characters, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman...oh man Hackmans role was incredible. also the musical score....I watch this movie every couple of months.a timeless classic, that should go down in history along side all Eastwood's other greats.<br /><br />the blu-ray has a lot of extras as well
0064471837|5.0|From the very first time I picked up this book, and its sequels, I was hooked. Sabriel is a young lady who receives a mysterious message from her father, delivered by a denizen of Death. This moment takes her on an adventure to discover who she is, where she has come from, and what her purpose in life is.<br /><br />The world Garth Nix has created is rich and vibrant, filled with characters you will love, and characters you will loathe, as well as characters who confuse you, and make you change your mind about them with each sentence.<br /><br />I have simply lost count of the number of times I have read this book. In fact, I had to buy another copy, because I wanted to share it with so many people, but still have a copy available on my shelf for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book. I had a hard time putting it down. And now I can't wait to start the third one.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I adore this app!! I love challenging friends and beating high scores! I love the challenge and the Goals. enjoy!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One was an outstanding book.  The mix of science fiction with nostalgia for the seventies and eighties make this most enjoyable.  I instantly related to and cared about the characters in this book.  This will go on my To Read Yearly shelf.  I eagerly await Mr. Cline's next book!
B0000025SB|5.0|The Final Cut was the last studio album by Pink Floyd with Roger Waters. Too many it's a jumbled mess, but in my opinion it's a companion piece to the Wall and a Stand on it's own Classic. The Album Centers on Waters obsession with WW II and how it effected His Life. To Many it was simply a Roger Waters Solo album with Pink Floyds Name on it. Sonically the album is a Marvel from Roaring Jets, Missile Shots, and Garage Doors opening In the midst of mostly laid back music. The Hardest Rocking Track(Not Now John) is a welcome break with a Great Solo and Lead Vocal From David Gilmour. There are several versions of this CD Including a few Remasters with Bonus Tracks. I Recommend the Original Columbia Release. A Hard listen for some but rewarding in my opinion if you give it a chance.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its a really good game. Its simuliar to temple run and temple run 2!! this is really awesome because....idk...it just is! cant explain. why don't you get it and see for your self! :D have fun! ~THIS IS A MUST GET~
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book might have been a little out of my comfort zone, but it was definitely worth it.. when I say AMAZING  I mean AMAZING!!!
0064471837|5.0|I've read this book over and over again and I always find something new to love about it. I never get tired of reading it again. This is one of the books I read when I was in middle school that helped me to start to love reading.<br /><br />It's a wonderful, fast paced read with many well defined characters. Full of adventure, suspense, danger and just a touch of romance, plus so much more. It's a good read for anyone just starting to explore different genres or even just looking for a good book to enjoy.<br /><br /> Sabriel, Touchstone and Mogget (the three main characters) are in a race against time. They must save not just the Kingdom of Ancelstierre but the world on the other side of the wall (WW2 type time period), from an evil only the Abhorsen, keeper of the bell's, who send's the dead back to rest, can defeat. With the current Abhorsen (Sabriel's father) missing, Sabriel find's she must take his place until she can find him, in hopes that he can defeat the evil creature named Kerrigor who has come back from the land of the dead before it's too late.

A great family movie, especially a daddy-daughter movie :) I went to see it in theaters six times and always cried :) It's hilarious, the picture is great, really emotional, and leaves a warm fuzzy feeling :D This movie is truly fantastic. And to you dads out there, you should really get your daughters, snuggle up with some popcorn, and enjoy the show!!!!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|There are better zombie books out there.  I do not understand the appeal that this book had.  It's both fragmented and under-developed.  I found the lack of a central character annoying.  Kudos to the author for trying a different story-telling technique, but there are far better zombie books out there.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The setup was such a challenge.  After connecting to TV, Chromecast needs to be setup through a computer/smartphone.  I used my MacBook to fire up the app that I was asked to download as part of the setup process.  My MacBook could not complete the setup process as I was constantly getting an error message that my router settings needed to be modified to unblock UnPP streaming.  After several attempts, I gave up and tried the same setup process on a Windows 8 machine.  The setup software during the installation was stuck up mid way as it required .NET foundation 3.5 and upwards, strange as I had 4.0 installed on my computer.  I gave up and tried on another Windows 8 PC. Same error message about .NET foundation.  As a last resort, I used my iPhone to complete the setup process.  If I was unsuccessful with my phone I would have probably returned Chromecast.<br /><br />My troubles did not end there; after the setup was complete, Chromecast needed me to download Cast extension from my Chrome browser.  The cast extension would not recognize my Chrome cast device both on Win 8 PC as well as on Mac.  I get an error message that if router transmits signals both in 2.4 and 5 ghz, Chromecast may not be recognizable unless there are some tweaks again in the router.  To me this was absolutely frustrating.  After several restarts and shutdowns of both Chromecast as well as my computers, I was finally able to connect! Yeh!<br /><br />Here are few initial comments after using it for a couple of hours -  For people used to Airplay and Apple TV, Chromecast is very rudimentary.  From a computer, all it does is stream a specific open tab  identified for 'casting'. Nothing more.  It does not mirror your PC nor does it 'cast' any other application other than the chosen Chrome tab.<br /><br />I am not complaining as I was able to get the 3 months off for Netflix.  So including that discount, for 11 dollars I was able to connect wireless from PC to TV without an HDMI/VGA cable!<br /><br />Update on Aug 11, 2013<br /><br />After having used it for a few days, here are a couple of updates:<br /><br />1. I have been able to connect Chromecast  to only one of my computers.  I am still struggling to connect other devices, with the cast extension on my chrome browser refusing to recognize them.<br />2. There is so much lag when I use Chromecast that internet streaming drags. I get a constant error message that my internet connection is too slow! I have a few internet bandwidth hungry devices at home and to support these I subscribe to higher bandwidth from my cable company and those devices never complain.<br /><br />I continue to be disappointed with this product.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Lots of characters and plots to keep track of but loved every minute of it! Will probably read it again before I rent the next one.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|Well, let's see. I think the whole film can be summed up in one word..... &#34;Snake&#34;.<br /><br />Actually, I think that is Kurt's single most repetitive dialogue in the whole film. I've always enjoyed these low-budget sci-fi/action films and this is a favorite. However, the film itself is actually just plain cheese, cheesy, cheesola, but that is what makes it so entertaining. Lines are plastic, action is rather mundane. I thought Kurt must have done this film to make a few more bucks off the success of Escape from L.A.... which actually is a 'better cheese' film. So, pull up a chair and a cold one..or two... or three and enjoy. Just don't expect to much but good old plain entertainment.

1595822003|5.0|Bernie Wrightson's illustrations are beautiful but what is particularly impressive is the way text and images work together to retell this class story.  The art doesn't overpower the text; in other words, Wrightson didn't use the Frankenstein story as a mere vehicle to show off his extraordinary talents as an illustrator. Rather, Wrightson's artwork helps set the mood and tone of the text and the two are woven together with great skill; the result is a fresh and remarkable retelling of an old classic.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|If you like the show and you find yourself singing the songs, this first album has all of them (except fade into you).
B0018M6J90|5.0|It was light hearted, funny, and touching. Francis Mcdurmot and Amy Adams where great as always. The two together where a great mix of great acting and comedy that will keep you laughing . A very heart warming movie I have recommend it to all my friends.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing this game.I have always played now I can play anytime now and this is very clean I do not have to look for good cards.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was so hard to finish that I never did. I read about halfway through and it was so poorly written and removed from life I couldn't finish it.  I have tried to finish it several times but can always find something better to read. I didn't find it erotic at all just an over-bloated ego male dealing with a naive and still somewhat stupid young female.  I know so many people enjoyed it, but I would love to get my money back. lol

B0034DGPEU|5.0|What an amazing, moving, and great book. I know that my mind and my heart will wander around with the characters, and events of this story for a long time.
0064471837|5.0|Having found this book in the library of my high school, I wasn't expecting much from it. I picked it up, checked it out, and got ready for some vague plot about magic and spells.<br />However, I was not ready for the intrigue, the mystery, the romance. The use of magic in this story is beyond any other story I've read. So, it was definitely an interesting twist to what I had expected.<br />Regardless if this is meant for young adults, this book is a must read for everyone. Garth Nix has this ability to weave the words around you and pull you into The Old Kingdom, fighting necromancers alongside Sabriel. If you're looking for a book to escape our world from, this is the start of a beautiful series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because I get to compete with other people and complete all the missions!!! I also love this game because of the mystery box and the daily challenges!!!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|What a fabulous movie!  This is probably the best movie that I have seen in the past several years!<br /><br />It is captivating, exciting, sucks you right into the plot from the very beginning and provides and ending that was a surprise to me.  Highly recommended.
B00422LESO|4.0|For all the women who will always love Mr. Darcy (not just any Darcy, but Colin Firth's Darcy) Shannon Hale has created this fantasy.  The story flows effortlessly, the characters captivate, and it all leaves you smiling at the end.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is very good. There are plenty of interesting levels & plenty of trivia. I would say its one of my favorite games to play.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|This is a well made bag that is a true value purchase.  I can not complain, when compared to other bags costing twice as much.  It will fit most SLR cameras with a standard zoom lens attached.  Some of the Telephoto lens maybe bit much for this bag - I am talking to you Canon owners.  Measure your equipment carefully before ordering.  The bag is an excellent bargain.  The only thing about this bag is being satisfied with carrying one lens.  It is hard to pick just one lens for the entire day.  Keep in mind there is no room for an external flash unit.  The pockets are small.  The larger front pocket will hold at most my Canon battery charger with spare battery and a couple spare storage cards.  The side pockets are very tight and suitable for only a storage card or USB stick.<br /><br />Summary:  I don't love this bag, but it is a bargain and something to protect a single camera and lens from dents and scratches.  Every camera bag I own is a compromise.  I will be satisfied the day there is an assistant to carry all my gear for me : )
0857680986|5.0|This book is very instructive.  Perfect for learning proper proportions.  Through the study of this book we are able to create more realistic humanoid figures.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was steamy, but the story line was amazing! I got a little frustrated with the lead female, but all in all, it was awesome!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great if you like puzzles. It gets challenging, definitely keeps you thinking! I don't feel like I zoned out after as other games. Perfect if you want to waste time without feeling like you've wasted it.

0064471837|5.0|Ever since I was a teenager and picked up Sabriel Garth Nix has always been one of my favorite authors. The whole trilogy is awe inspiring and thrilling the entire time. I have graduated college now but every few years I find myself rereading this trilogy. It is worth the buy!
B00AA8Q0FQ|4.0|I am an avid collector of the Monster High Dolls, especially the different series of dolls.  To complete my collection I needed to purchase the movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not a rip off of 100 floors. Very challenging but not impossible. The puzzles make sense. Really enjoyed and look forward to more levels.
B008KE3960|3.0|Fun but way glitched. I've spent a ton of time on this game. Bought gears etc. I've beat most of the levels all the way, but, when I open the game again my medals for completing levels with high scores are gone so I have to play the beginning difficulties before I can get to the last difficulty (survival) so it sucks. And my gears randomly go down after the game fully loads... I would suggest reinstalling the game to anyone else who has this problem but I don't want to because I've spent so much time and bought so much shit...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works awful with Chrome browser casting using a MS Surface Pro: Lots and lots of buffering, cannot watch anything for more than a minute, or two.  SURPRISE...it works perfectly from my old Motorola Xoom tablet! Also, with the Surface and the Zoom, the Chromecast redshifts, that is, everything is sifted into the red colors.  One other thing: Amazon, WHERE'S MY NETFLIX CODE? Actually, today was the 7th day (should have had the code in 5 days from shipping), but I gave them a couple of extra days to catch up.  But, I will be contacting them tomorrow, anyway. UPDATE: I sent Amazon an email this morning (8/7/13), and two hours later I had my Netflix code.  Kudos to Amazon.

0064471837|5.0|Both Garth Nix and the Abhorson series have given me much joy and entertainment since the first time I started reading Sabriel at 11. It's helped me come to terms with a few things, including death as it's dealt with heavily, and helped me feel less ashamed about being me. Strong and especially well written female characters are even now hard to come by in speculative fiction/fantisy, sabriel is definately a well written three dimensional character.<br /><br />To this day, I still consider this book and series to be my ideal book series, something I hold my own writing to and hope some of the magic rubs off.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is too perfect to even describe! I bawled my eyes out and I laughed with the characters. I can't even begin to describe how much I fell in love with Holder. I LIVE IT!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Really good Heatsink for a starting build.  This thing is pretty damn big as well. I was shocked when i saw the size and felt the whight of it, was kind of woried that my mobo would not be able to hold it.<br /><br />With my CPU, and i7-2600k over clocked to 4.3GHz, it keeps an idel temp of around 44 C  with an ambient temp of about 22C.  Instalation is pretty easy, but i would advise to do it before you put it into your case.  The thermal paste it comes with is pretty medicore, i would just get the arctic stuff for 5 bucks.<br /><br />This is not the greatest heat sink, but still none the less a great buy for some one looking for somthing better then stock.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Like it it was a good book it was help full read the book I the gets 5 stars great!
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|I don't mind buying a good game, I hate being treated like an idiot.<br />There is nothing else to say.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Works as per advertised, and very user friendly. I highly recommend this app it's worth every penny for the purchase.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is suspenseful yet simple, exciting and surprising. Unlike most games one cannot predict what comes next.  With each new puzzle is an exciting challenge and key to the room.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for a few months but no stores ever seem to have it. This product came in awesome shape and was better then described! Also it shipped and I revived it within 2 days!!!!!!! Holy fast very very happy!!!!
0062255657|5.0|Had no idea when I started reading that it would be one of those &#34;off-the-wall&#34; kind of stories that just captures your imagination. A book about life, yet full of fantasy. So glad I made this purchase into the unknown.
6304806434|5.0|Gave it away years ago and had to buy it again. Great show with a lot of feeling in it, also a lot of violence. Nicolas Cage plays an awesome part. A lot of good stars!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This was a great movie with a very interesting plot twist at the end. overall I would recomend this to anyone.  Great cast and awesome action sewquences.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|This show is amazing. I don't understand how people think its so much different than the other franchises. Yes the characters are a little more in depth, but their on a damn spaceship, with a Stargate, with alien encounters, they still went through the gate and got in all sorts of issues on other planets, and you get guest appearances from other cool Stargate familiar faces, though the actors In sgu don't need their support they hold their own. The people rating 1 star to hurt syfy are only in return hurting sgu. This show was the best on TV at the time and I hope it comes back! Buy it to support it!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This app has so many great sounds,and I love that they can be combined! I do kind of wish the sounds tht are binaural were labeled,because it said there are six, but I think that the only complaint I have with this awesome app. I've tried it for meditation and it was so very helpful. Next trial is sleep, but I'm almost positive I'll love it for that too! Hahaha. I definitely recommend it to other looking for a sleep/meditation sound app.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a stellar book.  Beautifully written, suspenseful.  Love the history and the love story winding through the entire book. And honestly, who would expect to find recipes at the end of a Stephen King novel!?  Read this book - you will not be able to put it down, especially if you lived through the 60s.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is an ideal free game! Although you can purchase coins for upgrades, it's easy enough to just earn then by playing. The game is simple yet challenging and has fun physics.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It would be much more enjoyable if i didn't have to watch the same ads over and over again!!! Would have given it 5 stars if not for that.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|My title speaks volumes for the first 5 songs of this album by JT -- it absolutely sucks.  I don't know what crowd he was targeting in songs 1-5 but 6-10 are awesome. I love the hip hop beats and the slow, chillaxing moods. Every artist has at least one song on album that's dreadful. Justin Beiber must've produced the first 5 songs, lol.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love uno and the other one costs money but this one doesn't the only problem is is that you only have a limited amount of plays.but you can win more plays just takes time.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|The app was great!! I had lots of fun playing I give this app five stars!!the creator did an awesome job
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's a lot of fun and very addictive. However, I don't like not having the ability to earn coins and having to always buy them. For this reason. I am rating it four stars.
B000007ODL|5.0|I first heard JJ Cale when I bought JJ Cale and Eric Clapton - The Road to Escondido. It's become one of my current favorites and I play it almost every day. So I ordered this one, put on the headphones, and gave it a good listen. It's now in my car and on my iPod. I love this music. Every song is great and gets better with every listen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! It has great graphics and I can have a real horse so it's like having . One but in a game!
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|They just don't make 'em like this anymore. So thorough and well-acted. Love Camelot. Love JFK. Love this movie. Tip top feature, don't settle for secondhand Kennedy movies.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I would like to have seen more about how our 'Star' become so efficient in archery, also I definitely had the feeling half way through it that this movie better have a follow up and my imagination was running on full cyclinders as to what could happen.
B00003CX8U|5.0|what else can I say?  Fosse's use of existing songs to create a first rate soundtrack is brilliant. I Love this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is super fun you can even get a unicorn :) And its free :0 EPIC that is why I love it:)
0525478817|5.0|THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is a book about young adults being forced to confront their own mortality from a relentless beast - cancer.  Hazel is a sixteen-year old cynical girl suffering from thyroid cancer with metastases to her lungs.  She can hardly make it up a flight of stairs without becoming short of breath.  She spends her life tethered to a portable oxygen tank.  The only reason she is still alive is because of an experimental chemotherapy drug that, so far, seems to be working.<br /><br />In an effort to keep Hazel's social life as normal as possible, her mother insists on her attending a cancer support group every Wednesday.  The purpose for Hazel's participation is much less about emotional support than about socialization.<br /><br />In Hazels words:<br /><br />ME: \\"I refuse to attend Support Group.\\"<br /><br />MOM: \\"One of the symptoms of depression is disinterest in social activities.\\"<br /><br />ME: \\"Please just let me watch American's Next Top Model.  It's an activity.\\"<br /><br />MOM:  \\"Television is a passivity.\\"<br /><br />ME: \\"Ugh, Mom, please.\\"<br /><br />MOM:  \\"Hazel, you're a teenager.  You're not a little kid anymore.  You need to make friends, get out of the house, and live your life.\\"<br /><br />ME:  \\"If you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to Support Group.  Buy me a fake ID so I can go to club, drink vodka, and take pot.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, Mom wins, and Hazel goes to group.  This is where she meets Augustus, or Gus - a hotty cured from osteosarcoma.  The only tradeoff is that he now has a prosthetic leg.  A small price to pay for your life.<br /><br />The two begin to spend more time together.  Hazel introduces Gus to her favorite novel, AN IMPERIAL AFFLICTION, written by Peter Van Houghton.  The book details the story of a girl with cancer.  What haunts and consumes Hazel is that Van Houghton ends his masterpiece midsentence.  Hazel obsesses about finding out what happens to the characters.  Gus joins her in this quest.  He actually succeeds in contacting the author and arranging for he and Hazel meet the mysterious man.<br /><br />In a twist of fate, Hazel, Gus, and Hazel's mother are granted a trip to Amsterdam where they meet the reclusive, alcoholic, and ill-mannered writer.  The meeting is a bust.  Hazel leaves bitterly disappointed and without her long-awaited answers.  However, the trip is not a complete failure.  The time she spends alone with Gus gives them both treasures that are typically only bestowed upon adults.<br /><br />The ending, not surprisingly, is sad.  I don't consider that a spoiler.  How could such a book end otherwise?  But for the specifics, you will have to read it yourself.<br /><br />Just as AN IMPERIAL AFFLICTION was a gift to Hazel, THE FAULT OF OUR STARS was a gift to me, on many levels.  As a physician, it enlightened me as to what life is like for patients outside the walls of a hospital.  The world spins for them, just as it does for the rest of us.  Unfortunately, they have to deal with the same amount of crap we all do.  Life doesn't completely stop just because of cancer, but sometimes that's the beauty of it.  As a mother of a teenage daughter, I laughed at Hazel's adolescent attitudes and pushbacks.  In the next instant, I cried at what her disease had stolen from her.  John Green's research and authenticity was impeccable.  His ability to take such a heart-wrenching topic and balance it with humor, love, and growth proves he is genius.<br /><br />I purchased a Kindle copy of this book with no incentive or communication with the author or any of his representatives.  My opinions are honest and my own.actually succeeds in contacting the author and arranging for he and Hazel meet the mysterious man.<br /><br />In a twist of fate, Hazel, Gus, and Hazel's mother are granted a trip to Amsterdam where they meet the reclusive, alcoholic, and ill-mannered writer.

B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|This is an awesome movie that I would recommend to any suspenseful / drama movie enthusiasts. Tom Cruise does a great job in this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is just what a kid likes in a game. Like subway surfers. Go minions! This game is awesome and very fun. Appropriate for all ages after you enter birth date
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|I love how the characters are all battling with their own inner demons whilst battling the real thing too. And a love triangle is always heart wrenching.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />I was looking forward to reading Jack Reacher.  I love this type of story.  I had just finished the first 5 books of John Sanford's Prey series and thought Jack Reacher would be a militarized or covert version of Lucas Davenport.  I was very disappointed.  If you are willing to accept whatever the author presents at face value, you might enjoy this as you might a big budget action movie.  For me, I was dubious from the beginning when the extremely competent (according to Reacher) police department failed to think of calling a phone number to see who would answer, and failed to do time math to determine that it didn't make sense for Reacher to be the murderer.  I thought perhaps it was the author's attempt to make Reacher look super smart and unfortunately the author could not devise a more clever demonstration.  I was able to overlook it.<br /><br />But then the middle of the book fills with awkward scenes and dialogs to force the action along.  It was unbelievable that Roscoe ended up in bed with Reacher so fast, the banker explaining retail banking was awkward, and the scene about Molly and her carry-on was just ridiculous.  The short choppy sentences became unbearable, there was too much unneeded detail, and the story was quite predictable so I skimmed quite a lot of the second half.  I did pause to laugh at the climax which was described in slow motion -- Hollywood action movie indeed!<br /><br />As to Reacher himself, he does not project the tough-as-nails fighter personality that Davenport or Jason Bourne does.  Despite the bodycount, it seems that he wins because he ambushes the bad guys or he &#34;fights like a girl&#34; (clawing at eyes, kicking in the crotch) or he gets lucky (multiple times he reflects that it could as easily have been him on the losing end.)  Between &#34;putting tenderness&#34; in his voice or face for Roscoe and having tears in his eyes all morning at the end, he seems to be an absurdly sensitive metro guy.<br /><br />I won't be reading any more about Jack Reacher.  (PS: The long self-congratulatory foreword explaining how Jack Reacher was created was just inappropriate.  Why would I want to read that before I had even met the character?  Hint: I wouldn't and I didn't.)
0062059963|2.0|I finally finished this book and I don't know where to start. I really like the The Selection and I don't know what happened in The Elite. I just felt America was very childish, I know she's only 17, but It was too much. She kept going back and forth about Maxon and Aspen. She would get very upset about Maxon talking and getting close with the other girls, but she was still seeing Aspen too!! How is that ok. I hope the next one is better, I hope we can see a better side to America.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the game. Unfortunately it only has 10 levels at this time. Makes you think, but not so difficult that you give up.
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|My 2 nieces loved this movie - they watched twice in one day  I will recommend this movie to others!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|It's lots of fun and keeps the mind busy without over taxing it. Lol give it a shot.  Free is good too.
B00C2C637I|5.0|This book was kinda boring at first but picked up in the middle. I enjoyed the ending It had a very big twist at the end. I would highly recommend this book to people who like adventure and weird science fiction books.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have gone through several big storms with the weather channel, including the mega tornado. I enjoy the maps most of all because they help me track what is coming my way. The social comments are helpful too because you know how close the weather is to you.
B005SV9X22|5.0|I fall in love with her :) That expression OMG!! It was love at first sight. and I used to hate her. Now can't stop following her.
B003LPV960|5.0|As a previous nanny I really enjoyed watching this movie with my nieces and seeing their reactions to what happens!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I like the new CD and pretty much every song. Can't wait to see them and perform there new songs.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a great family game all ages can play this or great game to play to pass the time
B004SBS8LA|5.0|THE BIRDS ARE ADDICTING! I enjoy playing as my before-bed-activity. Sometimes it makes bedtime a little later than it should be. In fact one of  the reasons I got a Kindle was so that I could play Angry Birds....and I have not wasted my money.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|It's easy to use, but I actually prefer using the website directly.  I've used it to order things and it works fine.
B0015XAT3Y|4.0|This is a good ELO CD. It is a shame this band went disco. This CD brings back memories of the era.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book drew me in and made the sadness and strength of the people who lived through the atrocities of WWII a reality.  I fell in love with the characters....even the narrator of the story, \\"Death\\".  A must read!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is visually stunning SF. While I was watching it I was so grateful someone actually invested the money to make this film because it is that rare film you can just turn the sound off (or play only the soundtrack) and give the eyes a feast.<br /><br />Tom Cruise gets a bad rap, and I think unfairly, because of some of his 'antics' and his religion. I don't really care about either. His antics have never hurt anyone and, so far as I know, his religion hasn't either. Yes, I know there are allegations of abuse but that is true of any religion and any atheist group, as well.<br /><br />But he delivers yet again another terrific performance, something he has done more consistently than any actor over the past 30 years. The rest of the cast, but I have to point out maybe the most surprising performance in the film and right up there with Cruise, that of Andrea Riseborough as Victoria.<br /><br />I think the 'scavs' were a disappointment, however, and that is why I take off half a star.<br /><br />Yes, Morgan Freeman is good but they never seemed real to me within the confines of the universe the director had created. Small criticism since they really aren't as prominent as they should have been but no spoilers here. I was able to watch the film without any foreknowledge and I enjoyed it as such. I wouldn't want to ruin that for anyone.<br /><br />The ending? There are great and surprising moments leading up to the penultimate scene in the film. It is an odd scene which is by turns stunning and somewhat pedantic. It didn't rise up to the level of the expectations I had built. But I enjoyed the ride so much getting there that I didn't matter. And I have to admit I did enjoy the very final scene even though I saw it coming.<br /><br />The extras are very good. Tom Cruise is always interesting in his commentaries as he is here with the director. He is not just an actor playing a part. He puts real thought into the film and has great appreciation for everything involved inmaking a film as a skill.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I was impressed when I received the DVDs, The box is very nice, inside is also nice, and the book that comes with it is really well made. In summary, a great purchase for people who loves batman.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie took me back to the time I was going to rock concerts. It sure was a different time back then. I would recommend this movie for older people. Not one for the whole family.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I hadn't seen most of these movies in years and am really enjoying watching them all. They are well done and entertaining. All the characters fit the parts so well and there's a lot of feeling to these movies. I've always been a Stallone fan but watching these as an adult gives me even more respect for him.<br /><br />The collection came nicely packaged and I've not had any problems with the discs so far (we are on IV). The image quality isn't up to standard with your normal Blu-Ray and it's even grainy at times but I don't think it was shot with the best cameras, at least the earlier ones. It's rather nostalgic actually.<br /><br />If you remember liking one or two of these movies, get this set. My husband and I have been having random Rocky nights since we got this and it's been fun. Well worth the very reasonable cost.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have loved every book of the Sookie Stackhouse series and other books by Charlaine Harris; however, this book just felt like she wanted a quick, easy end with no twists, turns, or plots.  I think she must have been tired of the series.  So sad.  I'm not a writer and even I could think of 110 more angles to write the end of the series...maybe she just started hating the characters after TV took over.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|I had low expectations of this movie after reading the reviews.  Got to say, I was plesantly surprised.  My husband and I both enjoyed it and have watched it several times since we got it. Granted, we aren't movie critics or anything, but we do know what we like, and this is one of em!<br /><br />Disappointed with the decision that Disney made about the packaging options.  No *COMBO PACK* available.  EVERY other 3D movie I own, there is a BLU RAY disk included which allows me to watch it in other players in the house, not JUST the 3D player in the living room.  So one star lost because of Disney.  BOO ON YOU Disney!
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This is a good movie that I would recommend to family and friends. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job in this roll. I hope there is a 3rd Sherlock Holmes
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I’ve always been skeptical of books that place their characters into supernatural settings but decided to read this one because of all the good reviews. And it was a great decision. This book is much much better than I could have expected!<br />“Outview” makes the readers think about many philosophical concepts but presents them in a very accessible way. One such concept is that of awareness.<br /><br />The author Brandt Legg makes us question our own lives and consider how aware we really are of our surroundings, of others, and of ourselves – and that’s a great issue to ponder for a person of any age,  teenagers included. Many ideas in this book and the eloquent way that the author expresses them feel like pearls of ancient wisdom in the modern world, and that’s incredibly appealing.<br /><br />Here’s just one such idea (out of many more that I loved): “The unseen world is enormously deeper and much more exciting than the human world, but when the two were combined it was a million times more fascinating.” This idea reminded me of the Little Prince, a character of one of my favorite childhood books by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who said that “eyes are blind. You have to look with your heart.” And isn’t that a great lesson for all of us, teenagers or not.<br /><br />“Outview” by Brandt Legg is a great book! You won’t be disappointed.
0061474347|5.0|I can't recall how many times I've read these books. They're like old friends inviting you back in over & over. I have them as audio books as well and listen to them while I travel.  Garth Nix has done an amazing job creating this fantasy world that envelopes you.  You will not be sorry if you crack open these series.
0425266060|5.0|Starting this book, I didn't want to put it down. It wasn't slow moving and kept me wanting more. I was able to read all three in six days! Morning, noon and night I read. Kids and husband were on their own...it was mommy time. This is the second time I'm reading this series in one month! I originally borrowed them from a friend and ordered the set on-line for myself!
B00000JGHS|2.0|This was like a bad porn movie but without the porn.. It was a waste of time to watch it
0425263908|5.0|Would highly recommend! Great story line and adult company.  :)  It's a page turner to the end! Keep going Sylvia!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love the game. The one flaw is u have to have WiFi. But it is cool how you get to chose an aviator.
B004KPX4W2|2.0|I've had more problems lately with the Amazon Prime streaming service. Is anyone else having the same problems? I love the Prime service, but the streaming is jerky and sometimes non-responsive.
B00005NB8K|3.0|I should have known that this Oliver Stone movie would not fallow history. At least the sound track was great.
B001HN6918|5.0|Fun, sweet and legendary!! A great sequence of the first one. Prepare for the laugh--skadoosh! Can't believe how well they blend American humor with the serious idea of Kungfu!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great game would've gave it five stars but lags a lot and takes a long time to load over all great game
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|I've seen Chick Corea perform more times than I can remember at this point. The man is just relentless when it comes to putting out quality music on stage, or in the studio. Whether he's performing with Stanley Clarke, Al Di Meola, Jean Luc Ponty or just solo...it stands to reason that Chick Corea is a virtuoso musician who never fails to amaze. His latest effort on The Vigil is no exception. Looking at the cover art, I had no idea what to expect because it just looks overly grandiose. I actually chuckled to myself, thinking Chick may have finally lost his mind! Luckily, I quickly discovered that the music within is sublime, complex and demanding of repeat listens. A true artist is always evolving his or her sound, while maintaining their original foundation. Chick Corea must be a true artist then, and I'm hoping he continues to release wonderful music.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This was one big thrill ride! The movie does not have any slow parts to it. It is a lot better than the original series. All Stat Trek fans need to see this movie.
B008476HBM|5.0|Everyone knows this is a great read. I enjoy this book. I have read it many times.<br />It is a time gone by and a true classic.
B004XIQIPQ|4.0|This album is pretty good, I enjoyed listening to it. When I received the CD, one of the corners was a bit bent, but I don't mind considering the price I paid for it. It also came pretty fast, so I'm more than happy with this product.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book! My regards to our American Millay, before thinking of cutting their funding read this they are worth every penny and more that we give them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Not so sure at first that this game would hold my attention. But it most certainly does. Besides the fact that even my kids are enjoying it. Quiet time these days are hard to come buy.
B002G1YPH0|2.0|This is another item I had to send back to amazon because the product description is incomplete.  And the fact that they do not allow you to contact a seller before hand about the product for more product info really hurts.  I figure if amazon is going to use a picture then they should used something to show the scale of the item in that picture. This fan is bigger than a soft ball and would not fit into any convential computer box. I know that todays newer processors run hoter but a fan this huge is ridiculous and only an idiot would think that it is necessary or wroth the money.  Again I had to order a product from another company to purchase a product that would work.  For christ sakes all they had to do is mention that this fan wieghts 3 lbs..  So for all you idiots out there that call yourselves master builders that recommended this item I think it's about time you found different type of work..  For you first time builders check with other services about what the right item is to put together when building your own machine.  Remember not every thing is what is percieved to be.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|LOVE this game AWSOME games get to  compete in competitions and feed and care for your horse you are a big fan of horses  this is your game

B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is good for passing the time. I am just confused on what I need to do. I feel like I'm missing something important. It's still fun. I play it once a week.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game this is all my baby sister plays when she gets on my kindle.Just like the temple runs but better
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Congratulations on making something new Fireproof.  I did muddle through in hours but they were so cool to feel like I was manipulating these beautiful mechanical creations.  The Room has atmosphere.
B00634GHJA|1.0|Downloaded this app when Amazon offered it for free. I thought finally I would have a way to transfer pics from my Android phone to my computer without having to attach them to an email.<br /><br />The setup \\"seemed\\" to go ok but I could never get the app [on the computer] to recognize the phone. Maybe I'm an idiot, but the instructions seemed to be convoluted and incomplete.<br /><br />Oh well . . . .
1567184855|5.0|This is the best book I have read in ten years. It answers many questions regarding life after life and even beyond our planet. If I am allowed to recommend only one book for people to read. This is it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Truly an addiction. Very cute. Keeps true to movie details. Costumes are a bit expensive but very cute. Played this many times during down time. Very good game build. Love almost everything about it.
B005L12SB2|3.0|One of the envelopes holding the cd's came apart in the first week of careful use. CD's are for people who like to have a physical product for years to come - these won't last that long, at least the cases...either use better glue or go back to plastic.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My fiancée and I watch an episode of Walking Dead every hour of free time we can spare! After finishing season 2 on Netflix, we couldn't wait until season 3 was released. Its a great storyline if you can get past the mental &#34;walkers&#34; freaking you out when you're home alone. Its actually not made to scare you though. I would say the story is more of a drama than an horror. This season only adds to the drama of season 2. I would highly recommend the purchase...and spring for the HD version!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it was better than the first. i would recommend it to everyone just a fun experience. Just as good as the first one maybe even better with the new characters.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I actually liked part 2 better than this one. This one is okay but seems to be a little slow at times. However, I still like playing it.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Great new band combines classic prog elements with radio friendly, melodic hooks! Oozes with creativity and perfectionism/craftmanship.  Haven't heard anything better yet this year.

B003L16FAE|5.0|For other old timers out there who may have seen the film when it was released in theaters in '87, I wanted to mention that this print is excellent, the transfer to Blu-Ray is nearly flawless and the experience is just about guaranteed to be better than what we saw in movie theaters when it was released. In particular, kudos to the quality of the sound reproduction, which I've found to be excellent whether pushed through a 5.1 home theater or stereo headphones.
0440246008|5.0|I got interested in the Reacher series of books when I watched the movie based on a Lee Child's novel. These books are hard to put down. My husband started reading these too and he usually is a slow reader, but he finished this book in record time. Great story line and lots of action.
B001HN6922|4.0|If you liked the first one you will like this although like everything else it's not as good as the original. Kids will love it.

1451624468|1.0|It is an accurate sign of our decadent intellectual culture that a prominent publisher issues such a book. I agree with most of the one star reviews and add a few points. I have a Doctorate in Philosophy and have done research in the history of science; I taught philosophy for 20 years.  First, the two chapter titled \\"Nothing is Something\\" and \\"Nothing is Unstable\\" are shocking to a person who intuitively knows that beings exist outside his mind.  In grad school, I remember a course in Medieval Logic where the professor said the Medieval logicians held that 'if you begin your argument with a contradiction (eg. 'nothing is something'), then anything follows' meaning that you can say anything no matter how illogical. Krauss does just that. Second, he says that philosophy and theology have nothing to say about the meaning of life.  This is stunning, indicating that Prof Krauss thinks life as he conceives it is reduced to physics; however the average person must take on faith (on the authority of Dr. Krauss)the directly unobservable theoretical entities like particles and multiple universes as well as philosophical principles like 'Nothing is Something'.  Thus, religious faith and philosophical knowledge are replaced with faith in the physicist as his only guidance in life; but physicists disagree and so do the Darwinians, so whom do we follow? Third, it amazed me that there was no mention of Chance in the extensive index.  Fourth, Prof. Dawkins says in an Afterword that material particles \\"go into and out of existence like fireflies\\"; apparently it is just their nature to go back and forth from nothing to something which would indicate there is a real difference between Nothing and Something. As a former teacher of philosophy, I am convinced that the first principle of THOUGHT and REALITY is the Principle of Identity or Non Contradiction which goes back to Aristotle and forward through Aquinas and to the 20th century Thomists like Gilson, Maritain and Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange, who said frequently that the intellectual choice is between \\"God or Radical Absurdity\\"; this book exemplifies radical absurdity. As a conclusion I would say that Krauss' book is very bad philosophy mixed with some standard modern physics although I cannot judge the physics.  As an antidote to Krauss' book, one could read \\"The Devil's Delusion\\" by David Berlinski, \\"The Science Before Science\\" by Anthony Rizzi, and \\"The Quantum Enigma\\" by Wolfgang Smith (all I believe available through Amazon);  all the authors have great expertise in modern physics as well as philosophy.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|This is an awesome application that you can use to purchase and sync applications across devices, but it has one major flaw.  The Amazon AppStore often tries to update applications it did not install, which usually ends up breaking those applications.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I think this is a well written well developed story line by a very good author...will not take long to read this one.This book is one of those you rarely find.You will enjoy it...take a look.
B008NA3I30|5.0|This is an incredible movie - touching, intimate, searingly romantic and yet ultimately very real.  Have watched it now 4 times and love it more every time I see it.  Those who expect special effects and Hollywood-ized romance will hate it....but anyone tuned into to real life and real emotions will love it as much as I do.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Great album!!! What more need be said/ If you don't have any Bonnie Raitt this will be a great start. Even if you do this one will knock your socks off, garunteed.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Even though slavery is no laughing matter, they made this movie very enjoyable. Jamie Foxx was perfect for this movie. Quentin Tarantino did it again!
B004EHZPEG|3.0|This is a book for the conceptual idea of how to write a story for a video game. Great content, but contains little to no programming.
006114665X|5.0|Mr. Clark explains that surviving documents are limited from the pre-war period. Those which would reveal embarrassing communications or implicate persons as initiators of the conflict have been destroyed or altered to present those people in a better light. Postwar history is dominated by the victor's argument that the Germans were to blame.<br /><br />The book details how minor conflicts in the 2 decades prior to the Great War created an atmosphere of paranoia and mis-interpretation of the intentions of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Serbia, Russia, and France. All of them were looking for allies with the mindset that fear would restrain any one country from acting while at the same time believing that war was inevitable as a means of solving diplomatic problems.<br /><br />I will try to summarize the evidence Clark has gathered. Serbia and Austria were competing for influence over the same territory and had become bitter enemies. Serbia was the silent partner in the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand who would probably have initiated a peaceful resolution after he became Emperor.<br /><br />France had loaned Russia money to build railroads to the German border. This would allow Russian troops to quickly engage the Germans. The French saw this as a counter to Germany invading France. But Germany saw that only a pre-emptive war soon would allow them to win. Austria moving against Serbia was seen as a manipulation by Germany to either defeat Russia or France. Austria banked on German support to keep the Russians out of the dispute. The Germans wanted Austria to hold off Russia while they defeated France and then took on the Russians.<br /><br />The Russian pre-mobilization was interpreted as the tripwire. The hawks in all capitals felt their views were vindicated and immediately pushed for war. Egotism combined with paranoia left little doubt that some kind of major war was inevitable and all the major powers had been arming for it for years.<br /><br />Personal comment: History is rife with Heads of State and generals thinking that a war would be quickly won. Most lasted years and only temporarily settled disputes. Alliances were fleeting. These lessons were not learned by those in power in 1914 nor afterward.<br /><br />Clark has collected a trove of official and personal correspondence that paints a much broader picture of the backdrop to the war. This is far more accurate and unbiased than the history taught in schools.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I have enjoyed all the Indiana Jones stories and this was just another of his exciting adventures. Recommend it to all ages.
0385349947|1.0|The book is excellent. Thought-provoking and insightful.  I got it from Amazon at a good price.  However, I bought the book for my wife for our anniversary. I paid about $18 extra for next day service. Instead of next day, the book was delivered EIGHT DAYS LATE.  I would have been better off driving 5 miles to Barnes and Noble to get it, which I may well do next time. Also, the extra fee for next day service was never  refunded. This is my first negative experience with Amazon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is the best! I love the minions in this app! they are all so cool and awesome! I also like the different kinds of minions you can unlock! this app is so awesome! keep up the good work!
B001DF68MA|2.0|This product didn't fit my bike nor my husband's bike.  We figured between the 2 options it would fit one.  So we wasted a lot of time figuring that out.  The seat itself is really small and narrow.  I was worried that my 30lb 17 month old would be uncomfortable in it.  WE ended up returning it.
159463176X|3.0|Not even half as good as \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"The Thousand Suns.\\" Unfortunately, it lacks the clarity of Hosseini's first two books.<br /><br />The characters were very interesting but there were too many of them which sometimes, tend to run into each other. At times, I had to go back in pages to make sure I was still with the same character.<br /><br />I would have loved to know more about Abdullah, about his life when he moved to CA and opened his restaurant. What happened to the little girl in the Kabul hospital whom the doctor had given hope? And the childhood boy playmate who was born in a refugee camp in Pakistan?<br /><br />I would have liked more about Afghanistan and less about France. Afghanistan is Hosseini's stregnth.<br /><br />I am looking forward to his next book. Two outstanding books out of three is fantastic!
B007SGM084|5.0|I read the trilogy in 11 days. A co-worker of mine let me borrow Fifty shades of Grey, which I read in 3 days and had to download the other two books. I went to sleep and woke up reading them. I couldn't wait to get off work so that I can indulge and loose my self in them. Even had my family laughing at my obsession. LOVED IT!!! THANK YOU E L James
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie was great. Very nostalgic.<br />The 3d is beautiful as well.<br />We don't have children and have watched this movie many times over.
B000SEI230|5.0|Nicholas Sparks gets me every time. I saw this movie when it first came out, but I was too young to realize it was a book. Now that it is one of my favorite movies and I've read most of his other novels, I finally read it and it is definitely a favorite.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|this is pure escapist fun to watch - there are of course technical flaws and some can be jaw dropping but overall for entertainment it's worth it
0345803485|5.0|All I can say is READ IT!!!! It is a great book. Yes, a lot of sex but so much more than that. I love them and have read them all more then once...

0345803493|5.0|These three books were the best and I just couldn't stop reading. Book one and two just wanted me to read more. But after the third one I wasn't sure if I was satisfied or not. I still can't make up my mind about that.
B005LAII8K|4.0|This was a blind buy that I have nothing to be sorry about.<br />The plot was interesting and the acting was top notch.<br />It's not a movie you can watch more than once a year or so though.
B002SKZBQS|4.0|Almost everyone has at one time or another wanted to take a stand as the main character in this story did. You knew it had to end the way it did but all thru the story you kept hoping it would end differently because you could relate to the turmoil he was going thru.
0064471837|5.0|I was going away on holiday to turkey a few years back and wanted a book i could read at the beach. Whilst at the airport i picked up some other book (can't remember the name) nearly went to pay and saw the front cover for Sabriel and thought it looked fantastic. Anyway i bought this book and it just gripped me until the very last page of the book. The characters are amazing and the idea of the bells and switching between life and dead is just fantastic. After i had read this book i HAD to buy the other books in the old kingdom series Lirael and Abhorsen and hearing that the new book clariel, made me want to re-read the books before clariel is released.<br /><br />I won't go into any detail about what the books about because i feel its best to find out each character and the story line yourself. However I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for that next series to read. By far the best books ive ever read anyway<br /><br />This series should be made into a movie!!<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book- \\"Does the path choose the walker, or the walker the path\\"
0345803507|5.0|I love all three books! They contain a lot of sex but there is so much more to it than that. Read them!

0399159347|5.0|In this multi-layered page-turner, three women struggle with unbearable situations. Cecilia Fitzpatrick is an ultra-organized wife, mother and Tupperware salesperson living in Sydney, Australia. She enjoys a happy marriage with her husband, John-Paul, sharing the joys of parenting their three quirky daughters. When one of those daughters develops a fascination with the Berlin Wall, it leads Cecilia into her attic to search for a chunk of the wall she acquired as a 20-year-old on a jaunt through Europe.<br /><br />The attic is well-organized but too close; John-Paul, suffering from claustrophobia, refuses to go into it. The only part of the attic that Cecilia has failed to organize is a stack of shoeboxes in which John-Paul saves each year's financial records. Although finding her bit of the Berlin Wall quickly, she accidently knocks down the tower of shoeboxes and must gather up the contents. That's when she finds something decidedly curious: a business-sized envelope inscribed in John-Paul's handwriting:<br /><br />For my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick<br />  To be opened only in the event of my death<br /><br />Cecilia is charmed at first, but then wonders if her husband knows something dire about his health. She mentions the envelope to John-Paul, who reacts very strangely. He begs her not to open it, claiming to be embarrassed. However, her daughters comment on their father; one claims she saw him crying, while the other makes an observation that Cecilia can't ignore. She is torn between her promise to John-Paul and her duty as a wife and mother. The letter inevitably will be opened, and the secret inside will alter everything in Cecilia's world.<br /><br />Meanwhile, another man divulges a secret to his wife. Tess O'Leary's world has revolved around her business partnership and relationships with her husband, Will, and her cousin Felicity. The three have formed a tight-knit family that includes Tess and Will's young son, Liam. When Will and Felicity tell Tess that they have something they need to say, she imagines it has to do with the advertising agency they share. Instead, the two people she is closest to devastate her, informing her that they have fallen in love. With her life shaken to the core, Tess takes Liam to stay with her mother in Sydney. To her amazement, when she enrolls Liam in St. Angela's, the local school, she discovers Connor Whitby, an ex-boyfriend, teaching PE.<br /><br />The school secretary at St. Angela's is a woman named Rachel Crowley, who is well-known in the area, partly because her teenage daughter was murdered more than two decades earlier. Although the crime was never officially solved, Rachel believes Connor to be the murderer. Meanwhile, the only part of her life that has given her joy recently is about to be removed, when her son and daughter-in-law take her grandson along on a move to New York.<br /><br />THE HUSBAND'S SECRET is the ultimate page-turner. How riveting is it? I devoured it in one deliciously unfettered day, unable to stop reading on and on. Author Liane Moriarty capably handles her cast of characters, weaving their stories together into a fascinating tapestry. These women are fully three-dimensional, and readers will experience a rollercoaster of emotions with them. Cecilia's story is particularly compelling; once she reads the forbidden letter, all bets are off. There is no predicting how the story could possibly end, and I predict no reader will manage to resist plunging onward.<br /><br />Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B000SEIDR0|5.0|I loved this book.  I first heard about Michael Pollan when he was promoting Cooked on the Colbert Report, and I'm so glad I did.  This book completely opened my eyes to just how far removed we are from real food.  He takes such a common-sense approach to food that we completely lack.  The idea of eating real, unprocessed food is so unappealing to people, we'd rather eat powdered food, obsessively count points on cardboard packages, and spend hours watching tv with shake weights designed to get rid of arm fat.  Michael Pollan promises us a healthier life, with much more pleasurable food--we should take him up on it!
0064471837|5.0|If you were to point a gun at my head and force me to describe Sabriel in one word, I'd probably piss my pants, because you are pointing a gun at my head. But after cleaning myself up, I'd say \\"original;\\" Sabriel is original. Many fantasy novels these days seem to be trying to cash in on the success of the \\"big\\" fantasy books, like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. The Abhorsen Trilogy doesn't: it is an original, brilliant story, with fantastic character development, and a fairly intense plot. I absolutely recommend reading this novel if you have money to spare, because it won't stop here. You will (I guarantee it) spend money on Lirael, and you will spend money on Abhorsen. Then when you're done with that, you'll spend money on Across the Wall, and eventually (still waiting, Garth) on Clariel.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great Game!  This is a classic game that I enjoyed playing as a child and now enjoy playing as an adult!
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I didn't have a whole lot of expectations for Equestria Girls when I first heard about it.  But my nephew and I saw it in theaters.  Loved this movie.  The special features were neat too.  Interviews with writers, voice actors, and songwriters were all pretty cool.
0064471837|5.0|I first came across Sabriel when I was in seventh grade. From the moment I opened the book, I was captivated. The main character finds herself with a great deal of responsibility tossed into her lap, and she steps up without whining and does what she can to save anyone she can, whether she knows them or not. The world is rich, the magic system detailed, and there is a sense of history and mythos that is hinted at to tease you along (and followed through on in the sequels). There is family, love and unexpected quirky allies. Once I finished the book it left me with one of those \\"what? it's over?\\" drained feelings. It was hard to let go. When the sequels eventually came out I devoured them. They all sit on my shelf of favorite books now, and about once a year I come back for another read through. I've introduced the books to others - my husband, my siblings, my friends - but I always think of them as \\"mine\\". I'm much older now. High school is long gone, college too, and now I have a little girl of my own. Someday I'll introduce her to my old friend and I hope she loves Sabriel as much as I do.
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|This is a very fun puzzle game. It looks great and has a very cartoon feel to it. The levels keep getting harder the more you play.  The first 4 levels are tutorials that get you antiquated with the game. When you setup a path and you fail the game will stop and show you where the mistake is for you to try again.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Do you want your spirit to be lifted up?  Do you want your faith in humanity to be restored?  Do you want some fun time?  Well, this movie can be an answer to all three.  The acting, production, historical authenticity - all the technicals of the movie is truly excellent.  But what is special is the heart behind this movie.  This movie can literally restore your spirit - and these days, not many movies can do that!  But to me, the real enjoyable part was constant surprise about the characters in the movie.  The movie does an excellent job revealing more and more of their personalities as the story progresses.  As a result, one is never bored but stays glued to what is going to happen next.<br /><br />An all around wonderful movie.  Highly recommended.

B007KDFWRG|5.0|I can't get Susan's voice out of my head from Midnight in Harlem. Her voice gives me the chills. She is so blusey and honest.I was blow away when I saw them on Erick Claptons program that i went out and ordered the cd. Derick is amazingly talented. I grew up in the 70's in BOSTON and this band reminds me of some  of the<br />the greats that were just coming up and playing at Paul's Mall and the Jazz workshop and Pooh's pub. I have brought the cd with me to a few friends houses so they could listen to just how superlative this band is. I would love to hear them perform live. Deborah Chevalier
B00DCRE83S|5.0|This has been one of my most anticipated albums of the summer for me.  I really liked the Metal EP and this continues very much in the vein of that ep with 11 tracks on the standard full length version of this album.  two of the songs are from the Metal EP (soldierhead and King of The UnderDogs) so they will are great to hear again, but the new tracks are excellent from top to bottom.  Mike Mushok from Staind plays his guitar very well on all the tracks, and displays that he is more than what he was limited to in Staind.  Very much an \\"old school\\" guitar, drum, bass sound.  For me, it is tough to pick a favorite song because all of them have catchy riffs and parts of each that just really resonate for me. each song clocks in between 4 to 6 minutes (shortest being 4 minutes with ampossible, longest being nocturnus at just over 6 minutes).  With songs of this length, Newsted is able to change paces several times and if you don't care for a part, wait a minute, and the next section may be really good. This has a lot of tones of his voivod work present in it, so fans of voivod may like this also. I highly recommend it to fans of good hardrock/metal/thrash.<br /><br />I have personally purchased 2 versions of this album, but there are several versions out there.  Amazon USA offers from what I can see only the standard 11 track cd and vinyl, but there is also the version I just purchased through amazon UK that offers the 11 tracks plus the bonus track \\"spiderbiter\\" and then the other two metal ep songs \\"skyscraper\\" and \\"godsnake\\" as tracks 12, 13, and 14 respectively.  This version includes the \\"making of heavy metal music\\" documentary dvd.  The other version I purchased was from i-tunes featuring the bonus track \\"The Differents\\" as track 12.  There is also the 2 vinyl version with 11tracks and possibly the CD, and a 12 track 2 vinyl version that comes with a CD that appears to be europe only and features the track \\"spiderbiter\\" also.

I have to keep buying the books as I loan them to friends who become hooked and sneak off with then.<br />Sabriel is such a fantastic female lead.

B009DCOU9S|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst &quot;puzzle&quot; games I have ever had the misfortune of playing. The hidden objects mini games are standard run of the mill types. But way too easy and only have to find about 15 items max. Some of the other puzzles are totally idiotic and make no sense what so ever. In some of these you have to complete a task such as finding a handle to open a valve to transfer a potion. If you don't click on an object fast enough the games automatically highlights what you need to do to progress. Also there is no penalty for just random clicking all over the screen. One last problem is that some of the mini games are extremely sensitive as to where you place found objects on the screen. A real test of patience and frustration. One plus is the graphics, which are well drawn and rendered. Also, it is not a short game; it took several hours to get through. All in all, I would have been very sorry had I had to pay ANY money for the game.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I feel like this book is more than a love story and more than a book about mental health. There's a little bit of Pat Peoples in a lot of us.<br /><br />Wonderful book. I think the movie makers even did a good job of adapting it and the actors of depicting the characters. But like all book lovers.... The book is better it paints a lovelier picture.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Tom Cruise has a reputation for super action.  This movie is not that.  Don't get me wrong.  Stuff does splode real good but this is a more cerebral sci-fi.  It isn't perfect, though I couldn't tell you anything that I would recommend changing.  Perhaps it is the certain level of bleakness inherent in the tale that leaves an after taste.  I am glad that I watched it and I can recommend it wholeheartedly if you enjoyed movies like Blade Runner, Matrix or the early parts of The Island.  Tom Cruise is making some interesting moves these days.  I wrote him off. . .for reasons that don't need to be expounded. . .but after Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages and Oblivion I'm now more of a fan interested in seeing what kinds of choices he makes next. As an actor and a brand he has a lot more life left in him.

B008JFUNWS|1.0|As far as the film genre of sci-fi fantasy goes, it might be time to say enough is enough - for the time being, at least.  Between Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Twilight, The Host, Beautiful Creatures, and any other franchise with a bunch of teen drama and whacky creatures running amuck, it's pretty safe to say the films of this particular genre are growing increasingly stale.  This genre of film has gotten so ridiculously predictable that if you've seen Harry Potter, you've essentially already seen the Twilight films and so on and so forth.  Seriously, how many different stories can possibly be told about the \\"chosen one?\\"  Each and every one of these films, including a beloved franchise like Star Wars, recycles the same old story about prophecy and destiny to the point that you'd think these authors and filmmakers would be tired of making stories about the same old thing.  Come to think of it, it's no wonder authors, like J.K. Rowling, Stephanie Meyer, and Rick Riordan, have all been named in plagiarism lawsuits in recent years.  When everyone's stories look alike, sound alike, and end alike - what did they expect to happen?  And, speaking of recycled stories - Percy Jackson is back with the film series' second installment, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.<br /><br />Based on the novel of the same name (by Rick Riordan), Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is directed by Thor Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) and stars Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson - the demigod son of Poseidon.  An attack penetrates the walls of Camp Half-Blood, forcing Percy, his newfound Cyclops half-brother, Tyson (Douglas Smith), and his friends, Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), to leave the camp on a mission to retrieve the Golden Fleece to restore the mystical barrier.  Meanwhile, Percy's former friend and current nemesis, Luke (Jake Abel), has his own plans as he and his followers are also on a mission to secure the fleece.  Leven Rambin, Stanley Tucci, Nathan Fillion, and Anthony Head also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />In all honesty, Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief provided a great deal of entertainment - incorporating the gods of Greek mythology into present day.  While the first Percy Jackson film greatly resembled the events of the early Harry Potter films, the Percy Jackson character still had a great deal to offer regardless of the easy comparisons.  Like Potter, Jackson struggled with the idea that the world was full of mythical beings, along with the weight of being the \\"chosen one.\\"  Also like Potter, he relied heavily on his friends to help guide him through his journey and to help him become this potentially great leader of \\"destiny.\\"  Unfortunately, the main problems with Percy Jackson is he's not as popular as Harry Potter, doesn't have the drive or ambition of Frodo, and his sword isn't as cool as a lightsaber.  And frankly, his sidekicks - Grover and Annabeth - are not nearly as loveable as Ron and Hermione.<br /><br />On paper, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters provides a solid, well thought out storyline.  The idea of Percy Jackson being challenged again after the showdown in New York is an inevitable occurrence, but the problem with the sequel is that he was challenged too much in the first film and not challenged enough in the sequel.  In the first film, there's a massively threatening potential from the Greek gods to go to war with one another.  Let's be honest, the second film's plot relies solely on the journey to acquire a blanket.  That's right - the majority of this film follows these powerful characters as they travel across the United States to find a blanket, which happens to be resting on the shoulder of a giant, grumpy Cyclops - who lives in an amusement park.  The last film had lightning, gods, and a trip to Hades, while this sequel has absurd, blind taxi drivers, followed by an eventual trip to the oceanic version of the Pit of Sarlacc (from Return of the Jedi for those that don't know).  Sadly, there's no Boba Fett - or Amelia Earhart, in the belly of this water-based beast.<br /><br />Most (not all) bad movies at least have a few positives to admire.  Although admiration probably isn't the right word to use, but in any event, this film does have an early visit from a pretty sweet Transformer-like bull that shoots fire and does some major damage to Camp Half-Blood.  When Michael Bay gets a look at this thing, he'll probably wish he would have thought of it first - possibly having it transform from a Red Bull delivery truck (after all, product placement and transformers go hand-in-hand).  Aside from the bull, this sequel is also paid a visit from not one, but two Buffy: The Vampire Slayer alums.  Anthony Head takes over for the inexplicably absent Pierce Brosnan in the role of Chiron and Nathan Fillion plays the role of Hermes, the messenger of the gods who poses amusingly as a glorified UPS clerk.  Regardless, it would appear someone in the casting department has some deep admiration for Joss Whedon.<br /><br />It's clear the Percy Jackson novels have a substantial fan base, and 99 percent of the time, a film is unable to fully grasp the emotion of a novel.  The knock on this film has nothing to do with the novels, which have attained their own praise and devotion.  Still, it's painfully obvious this film sequel bumbles around from beginning to end, feeling unorganized and at times - just downright fake.  The CGI in the film is nothing to write home about, and while the cast is moderately entertaining (due largely to the addition of the mean-spirited character work of Leven Rambin), they still cannot make up for the poorly adapted script and bad direction.  Thor Freudenthal takes over for the Harry Potter alum, Chris Columbus - and it shows.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the Percy Jackson film franchise, this sequel loses any kind of \\"mojo\\" that was built in the first film, inevitably leading to this this dreadful and at times unbearable sequel.  The addition of a female lead, a bunch of zombies, and a golden blanket are simply not enough to maintain the average level of entertainment provided in the series' predecessor.  Still, the readers of Percy Jackson are ages 10 and up, so kids will easily find more entertainment in this film than adults.  The absence of the gods, Hollywood star power - not to mention an actual sea of monsters, is detrimental to the outcome of this film.  If you haven't yet invested in this film franchise, do yourself a favor and keep it that way.  But, if you're looking to acquaint yourself with Percy Jackson - hit the books.<br /><br />GRADE: D<br />FNDNreview.comse that don't know).

B00CA4S27W|5.0|I have, and listen to, all of the &#34;Blackmore's Night&#34; albums and DVDs. So I have something to compare. This album shines! I was captivated from the opening cover of the Randy Newman song &#34;I think it going to rain&#34; ( So much prettier with Candace), to the last track by Richie's late Deep Purple collaborator, Jon Lord. There is an interview type DVD included which shows how much their daughter has grown.

B000E41MRC|5.0|This is perhaps the best known of Leni Riefenstahl's cinematic propaganda pieces for the National Socialists and Hitler.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the speeches demonstrate a considerable extent of concern among Hitler and his associates over the continuing fallout from the &#34;Night of the Long Knives&#34; in 1934 and the subsequent rise of the SS at the expense of the older and larger SA.<br /><br />For those who have studied the Third Reich at all, it is helpful to be able to put faces together the names of some of the second and third tier of Nazi personalities.<br /><br />To anyone interested in the how and why of National Socialism, this is an excellent example of the face that the Nazis sought to present to the German people.

0316228583|2.0|I don't know what all the hype is about this author writing a book \\"for adults.\\" She approaches her characters in the most cynical way, as if she can't stand any of them and they deserve whatever they get--they are caricatures, at best. It's as if none of them has any spiritual center at all; they exhibit only the most negative character traits: envy, jealousy, hatefulness, cruelty, indifference, arrogant self-focus, crippling self-loathing, competitiveness, ruthlessness, and general heartlessness. I read to the bitter end, thinking that surely she was going to pull something out of the hat--but no such luck. Ruthless herself, she tied up each pathetic little life in a paragraph and brought the book to a merciful end.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is the first book of this kind that I've ever read.  I chose to do so because the author was an educated man of science, an atheist, and a neurosurgeon.  Those credentials, in my opinion, gave him considerable credibility in writing about his personal glimpse of the afterlife.  His remarkable, detailed account of his journey to Heaven and back was amazing, especially since there is no rational explanation for his complete recovery from his diagnosed terminal condition.  His unique experience has made him a &#34;believer&#34;, and a man with a mission.  Sharing his story with the rest of the world is admirable, and his motives seem pure, since a neurosurgeon's income is substantial in itself.  I want to believe in Heaven; his book has helped me to do so.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|There is no other artist at this age that has the energy of Buddy Guy. He has found the fountain of youth. His voice sounds great and NOBODY can play the guitar with such a FORCE as Buddy Guy. When he goes into one of his patented guitar solos I just crank up the volume. He continues to amaze. Have seen Buddy live many times and just saw him a couple weeks ago. Still going strong. Love this album and a double album is a special treat. Buddy Guy is one of a kind. A true gem of an artist.

You can change the settings to customize it to your liking. The app itself is very professional looking. I thoroughly recommend feedly for anyone who wants to stay up-to-date on informative blogs.
0064471837|5.0|I loved reading this book. I was drawn into the world of the Old Kingdom as soon as I started reading. The magic system of this world is really quite interesting. Much of it revolves around necromancy, the raising of the dead. However, there are many uses for that particular brand of magic. However, there are also other types of magic that do not deal with the dead. For an interesting system of magic, I would read this series.<br /><br />This series is great for readers both young and old. I first read this series several years ago, and I am still anxiously awaiting Clariel.

140006922X|1.0|One need only view his twitter account to see his low level use of language  [...]    Luke 4    14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.    15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.    16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.    17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,    18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,    19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.    20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.    21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.    I John 1    1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;    2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)    3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.    4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.    Luke 1  King James Version (KJV)    1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,    2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;    3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,    4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.    John 8:6  King James Version (KJV)    6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.    I wonder why this author is afraid of bob dutko on wmuz?    [quote]  Hi all, Bob here. (sigh)  Reza Aslan just cancelled our interview scheduled for tomorrow. His people e-mailed my Producer, Jan and said they \\"forgot\\" something else he has going. Regarding a re-scheduled date, they said they would \\"let us know\\" if he can reschedule.    I've noticed the interviews he's done have been mostly friendly puff interviews. Obviously, my intentions were to challenge him direc...tly on his claims. I would have been respectful, of course, but he was going to have some tough questions to answer.    I've read his book and some of the claims he makes is that:  1) Jesus was illiterate  2) Jesus never claimed to be the Son of God or Savior  3) The Gospels were written around 100 A.D.  4) The Gospels were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke or John.  5) Jesus wasn't really about peace, but a violent overthrow of Rome.  6) He wanted to just set up an Earthly kingdom, not some \\"Heavenly\\" Kingdom.  7) The Gospels are made up fiction, re-writing who Jesus \\"really\\" was.  8.) Jesus never rose from the dead.  9) Paul invented Christianity as we know it today, making up Jesus' deity and resurrection.  .....and the claims go on.    Anyway, I'm very disappointed he cancelled our interview for tomorrow. I think he needs to be (respectfully) challenged on his claims. BTW, one of the questions I also hoped to ask him was \\"You claim Jesus was not born of a virgin, but you do at least admit he was crucified. Since the Qur'an claims Jesus WAS born of a virgin and that he was NOT crucified.....as a Muslim, are you therefore saying the Qur'an is wrong?\\"    Well, bottom line, I know many of you were looking forward to this interview (believe me, I was too), so I'm sorry we won't have that to hear. I will go forward with debunking his claims today and tomorrow on my show and I hope and pray he will do an interview with someone out there who will directly challenge him.[/quote]  [...]  [...]
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I loved this book and look forward to the next one in the series. I feel the need to let you know, however, there were many typos - too many. Some were clearly the result of edits that left extra words in the sentences and others were words removed in error.  I even saw more than a few errors in tense. In one instance the spell check  used \\"duel\\" instead of\\"dual\\" which of course made quite a difference in the meaning . I have never felt the need to make a commentlikethis one before but the editor of this novel really needs to..do a better job for this wonderful author!!<br />Sandra Hartlieb<br />Sanhart.ak@gmail.com

1250012570|5.0|Park is a decent, Asian guy and Eleanor is a bit of lost soul, self-conscious about her size and aware that she doesn't fit the \\"right\\" mold of what her peers say a teen should be.  Chapters are headlined Park or Eleanor as they tell their stories. Their friendship takes its first tentative steps on the bus and blossoms into a physical relationship over shared music, awkward situations, stupid teen stuff, mean kids, not enough money, sweet gestures and much more.  The language is strong and sometimes crude, but I think it fits the world of these teens.  I loved the complexity of the characters and the painful truthful tone in the way this story was written.<br /><br />Realistic fiction at its cringe-inducing, laugh-provoking \\"I'm so glad I'm a grown up now\\" best.<br />Easy to recommend to high school readers.<br /><br />I do have a minor quibble with the cover: Eleanor is described as \\"heavy\\" and size issues are mentioned more than once in the book, yet the cover shows her shoulders the same size as Park. I wish the cover artist had been bold enough (or true to the story enough) to acknowledge that Eleanor's size is one issue she deals with.<br /><br />About me: I'm a middle school/high school librarian<br />How I got this book: purchased for the library

B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Before I begin: I am a Power User for Anker so I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />I received the product yesterday. One thing I must say about Anker products is that they take care to use quality materials. The products look and feel great. My previous Anker product was an ergonomic mouse which I paid for (not provided free) and it looks and feels great, just as this external portable battery does! It fits in the palm of my hand and the material doesn't look/feel cheap. Being extremely light weight and compact, I really think this is a must have gadget for people on the move and for smartphone users (which is almost everybody, these days).<br /><br />I decided to test it using my HTC One phone and my iPad. Three LED lights came on when I first used it out of the box which meant that it had around 75% charge. I first charged my phone overnight from 30%-100%. One LED was left on when I tried to charge my iPad next. It took a very reasonable 40 mins to charge the iPad (while I was working on multiple pdfs in Goodreader) from 3% to 11% - I call it reasonable because it is actually comparable to the time it takes me to charge it using the apple charger using a wall adapter. The time taken really is a very subjective measure as it will depend on how many background apps you have running, whether or not you're working on the device while it is being charged, etc. From my initial tests, this external battery seems to be doing what it is supposed to. I will update my review once I have had a chance to use this extensively but the first impressions are very good. I'll upload some pictures later.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Just about anything this man does is GREAT.  His stories are wonderful for adults and children alike.  Hope he puts out a whole lot more.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the most beautifully done production! The locations, the scenery, the costumes, the casting...all superb! The BBC always does an excellent job. Although the casting is wonderful throughout, I cannot imagine this production without Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. They just click together.<br />My daughter is a huge fan of the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice. She thought this one just wasn't up there with that version. This one, she said, lacks passion!! Oh, my dearest daughter! Passion is in no way lacking in this production. But instead of heaving chests and heavy breathing, it's in the chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth (Firth and Ehle for those who may not know). It's in the nuances, the body language, especially from Darcy. And those eyes!! That man speaks volumes with his eyes. Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy, and I can never picture anyone else in that role. And the swimming scene with Darcy walking up on Elizabeth and his stammering and nervous awkwardness at the situation...and her embarrassment...great, great stuff!!<br />I enjoyed very much the extra material included in this DVD set. Especially hearing Andrew Davies talk about why he chose to write certain scenes as he did. I can never again watch the scene where Elizabeth walks to Netherfield and meets Darcy just outside without remembering the comments of Mr. Davies!!<br />I am so proud to have this in my video collection. It will be watched and enjoyed over and over for years to come.

B000028U0Y|5.0|There are very few albums that influence music the way this one has.  I was 14 years old when this album was released in 1968.  I can remember playing that vinyl LP so much I literally wore it out, not to mention my Dad got sick of hearing it so much.  The beauty of this version is that it restores the original concert, complete and in the original order, adding back the songs that were cut from the 1968 record because of time constraints of the vinyl LP's used at the time.  It also presents the concert complete with NO censorship, as was common in 1968.  You hear everything that happened at the concert, \\"colorful metaphors\\" and all!  This is also a brand new digital master from the original master tape, so audio quality is excellent.  As primitive as recording was at the time, they apparently used some very good and very expensive tape recorders for this concert, because the quality in transition to the CD format is amazing. Producer Johnson and his recording Engineer, Charlie Bragg, overcame the huge problem of \\"live sound\\" in the all-concrete cafeteria at Folsom by grouping all of the microphones together on stage, as close to the performers as possible, and then going direct into the two four-track machines with no \\"EQ\\" at all.  The resulting recording is stunning.  It lets you focus on what's important......the music.  And it is awesome......almost beyond description it's so good.  This has to be one of the top 100 albums in history.  There are very few positive things that came out of 1968..........Apollo 8 was one of them......this recording is definitely another.  Absolutely essential for anyone's music collection.
B0085FF55W|1.0|As usual, only ONE good song on the entire CD. Such potential, such a let down. Maybe in a few years they'll publish a \\"Best Of\\" CD and we'll get our moneys worth. This CD literally went in the trash...

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a great book that had my emotions on a roller coaster ride...I absolutely loved the entire series!!! Recommended it to all literal thrill seekers.
B00AG475K8|5.0|I saw this in the theater when I was 15. Granted I was the \\"target audience\\", it left an impression.  I'm normally not a fan of romance, the 80's, or whiny teen movies, but Some Kind of Wonderful ranks right up there with The Breakfast Club.<br />The soundtrack is available, and for it's time, is actually very listenable with a couple songs that really get stuck in my head.
B00COCY67A|4.0|Starting with his '68 Comeback Special, a reawakened Elvis conjured a remarkable late-career hot-streak that included 1969's From Elvis in Memphis, the revitalized Vegas stage shows documented on That's the Way It Is and On Stage, and a return to his country, blues, gospel and rockabilly roots on 1971's Elvis Country. In January of 1973, Elvis stormed the airwaves with Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite, and soon after signed a new seven-year contract with RCA. In July and December of that year he booked himself into the legendary Stax studio on [[ASIN:B004SC8XHI McLemore Avenue]], adding to a string of Memphis studios that had been good luck charms: Elvis had launched his career at Sun, and revived his sense of self at Chip Moman's American Sound in 1969.<br /><br />The July sessions produced ten masters, eight of which were released on 1973's Raised on Rock, and two held back for 1974's Good Times. Four were also issued as singles, , with \\"Raised on Rock\\" climbing to #41 on the Hot 100, Tony Joe White's \\"I've Got a Thing About You Baby\\" peaking at #4 country, and \\"Take Good Care of Her\\" making the Top 40 AC. All ten of the masters were solid, though by no means extraordinary. Elvis was in good voice, but neither the material nor the band assembled from road regulars and Memphis guests sparked anything really deep. Elvis connected well with bluesier material like \\"Just a Little Bit\\" and Leiber & Stoller's \\"If You Don't Come Back,\\" and gospel-tinged backing vocals add weight to a few ballads, but the sessions never lift off in the way of his earlier work at American Sound. Two tracks - \\"Girl of Mine\\" and \\"Sweet Angeline\\" - swapped in players from the Stax house band, including the MG's rhythm section of Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn and Al Jackson, but you'd barely know it from the final outcome.<br /><br />The December sessions were a great deal more productive, both in final output - 18 finished masters - and in musical vitality. The results were split across 1974's Good Times and 1975's Promised Land, further dissipating the sessions' unity and squandering the marketing value of \\"Elvis at Stax.\\" But even with the inept marketing, the sessions turned out three Top 20 hits on each of the pop and country charts, and a country chart topping album in Promised Land. Elvis sounds much more deeply engaged than he had in July, and the material and arrangements are a great deal stronger. Highlights include a fiery take on Chuck Berry's \\"Promised Land,\\" the strings, horns and deep bass of \\"If You Talk in Your Sleep,\\" the gospel-funk \\"I Got a Feelin' in My Body,\\" Jerry Reed's revival-charged \\"Talk About the Good Times,\\" and feeling covers of \\"Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues\\" and \\"You Asked Me To.\\" Two ballads, \\"It's Midnight\\" and \\"Loving Arms,\\" feature deeply touching, standout vocal performances.<br /><br />Beyond the twenty eight masters, this 3-CD set includes a generous helping of alternate takes and one unfinished track. All of this material has been released before, but scattered across a number of posthumous collections and expanded reissues. Augmented with bits of studio chatter, the outtakes give a more organic view of Elvis' presence at Stax than did the dispersed master takes. What you'll hear is an artist who's really committed to most of the material, and though the master takes were chosen for their commercial viability, the alternates are filled with vitality. Unlike the many soundtrack sessions through which Elvis often sleepwalked, and despite the Stax sessions being the product of a contractual obligation, Elvis was ready to make great music of his own volition. Freed from the confines of Hill & Range's catalog, Elvis drew from both longtime suppliers and contemporary songwriters, recording songs with which he felt a personal resonance.<br /><br />That personal resonance also applied to the assembled players, who were drawn from Elvis' road band and key Memphis and Muscle Shoals players such as guitarist Reggie Young and bassistNorman Putnam. But the results weren't as deeply impacted by Southern soul as were the earlier sessions at American Sound; Stax, it turned out, was more of a conveniently located venue than a sound with which Elvis wanted to engage. The label's legendary musicians were barely involved in the July sessions, and not at all in December. By the time the later dates came around, even the Stax recording equipment had been swapped out in favor of RCA's mobile unit, leaving the converted movie theater studio as Stax's only real participation. Still, Elvis was home in Memphis, riding the crest of a remarkable career resurgence, and mostly (modulo the Colonel's lingering machinations) in control.<br /><br />The 3-CD set is delivered in an 8x8 box that includes a deluxe 42-page booklet stuffed with photos, ephemera and notes by Roger Semon and Robert Gordon. The discs are screened with images of tape reels, and slid into the pockets of a tri-fold cardboard insert, from which fans will likely want to relocate them to jewel cases or other appropriate storage. Collectors who already own [[ASIN:B000009NSW Rhythm and Country]] and the FTD reissue of [[ASIN:B000RGUH46 Raised on Rock]], [[ASIN:B003YCLRI0 Good Times]] and [[ASIN:B006ZYVFMW Promised Land]] will have most of the tracks in this set, though having them all together in one (affordable!) place produces a uniquely coherent view of the sessions. One thing that becomes clear is that Elvis had a great album in him, but a contract that demanded two albums and multiple singles per year dug deeper than the sessions could support. What's great here is really great, and what's good is still passable. Though he'd record more in 1975-76, these Stax sessions are the last major sessions in his remarkable comeback.

B008OOYALE|2.0|i dont even have this on my phone anymore,. did not like it much i guess no biggie, it might be good for somerone but not me
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to kill to time. It makes you use your brain though. Don't know what else to Say. It's free I guess.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is one of Brown's best works. I originally read it in the summer of 2004 on a beach in Hawaii. It still thrills me as much on my couch in Tulsa as it did then!<br /><br />Langdon is a great character, and when Brown isn't having him people unbelievable feats of derring do, he's a likeable character.<br /><br />I think Da Vinci Code gives a reader a great visual sense of Rome's layout. For someone who used to live there, I could easily follow where Langdon was travelling as the story weaved in and out of the city.<br /><br />Fast-paced, emotional and inventive, this is a great way to introduce yourself to Brown's writing.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The whole series is great. Wow it kept me coming back for more and more. I can't wait for more. Great writers.
1781162646|5.0|What is not to like----it is a Stephen King novel. You know it will be worth reading when he is the author.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I liked the movie so much that I decided to read the book too. The book is great - of course they altered the movie quite a bit from the book, but both were good.
B0083GCK5G|5.0|This is a modern-day Beach Boys classic. The boys of summer are back and so is their hallmark sound.<br /><br />From the haunting opening track to the final chords of the last song, this album will have you smiling and singing along. It's best listened to a warm summer day, windows down, radio cranked up and arm hanging over the door.<br /><br />Love it!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|My friends recommended I see this TV show. Thank God I did. I had never laughed so much with any other TV comedy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is very childish and weird but it is one of the most entertaining games I have on my tablet. When I'm bored I know what to check on
B00BDSRKHO|4.0|I was very excited for this CD to come out and it did meet expectations. They appeal to old fans like myself and to new generation of OMDers. Helen of Troy is their best song to date. There are 5-6 other songs that have get melodies and are a bonus.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|One of the many things I love about this movie is that there is no pretense that life isn't messy.  I don't know anyone whose life isn't messy!  I'm guessing those who have criticized this movie for being depressing or for glamorizing mental illness believe they are without dysfunction or normal or healthy and or feel they are hopeless victims living sad humorless lives.  I think this movie is about seeing the glass as half full and appreciating what is wonderful and worthwhile in every life....even a life that is extraordinarily complicated and challenging.  It is a very honest, funny and touching movie about the patience, acceptance and tolerance of unconditional love.  It made me feel good about the potential for happiness in all of us.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game has been a blast to play. I would definitely give it five stars. The horses look so real and all the things you can do with him or her is amazing. Playing with my horse feels like I actually own her in real life.makes me wish I really had a real horse. Getting to feel her and groom her is very fun.just to see her all clean and healthy makes me feel amazing.oh and when I clean her stall and training area, it makes me feel responsible. This horse game is the most amazing, spectacular, magical game on my kindle fire and five stars is what I rate it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard but still makes you think.  Other games like this can be too hard to figure out.  Lots of fun.  Wish there were more rooms!

0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was twelve years old, and it immediately joined ranks with The Chronicles of Narnia, Redwall, and the Lord of the Rings in my young mind. Sabriel has stuck with me through the years, the sheer force of such a strong character keeping me coming back to the series again and again. As a character, she has influenced not only my own writing, but my own views on what personal strength and determination can look like. As a novel, I am constantly re-drawn into the intricately built world of Ancelstierre, the Old Kingdom, and what lies beyond them both.<br /><br />In short: Read Sabriel (and the books that follow). Let them draw you in like the current in a dark, alluring river.
B0063IH60K|1.0|It's a pretty good game but nothing can beat subway surfers and gta they are awesome I'm really good at grand theft auto my high score on subway surfers is like three millionth go go go go go go go go go go go go go go
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreckit Ralph was pretty original and animated, great nostalgia, great voice acting and a great message, Families wil love it!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|A series that the whole family can watch, no violence, no swearing, no sex, nothing you would not want your 5 year old to watch. See the celebs of the day match wits with the master. They never win. Columbo is one of those series that brings me back to a time when life here in the US was simple and good. It also shows that you don't need special effects or violence or anything else but good writing to entertain. You won't be sorry.
B005PK57IK|4.0|My sister recommended The Good Wife and I watched seasons 1, 2, and 3.  I was very, very disappointed that I could not get season 4 unless I purchased it.  This  really annoys me, because I am still behind when the new season begins.  So while I rate the Good Wife at 4 Stars, I rate Amazon's service at 1 Star.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|Thiss app got all that you need to make a sweet rave party dude tell all your friends buy some drinks and enjoy the moment
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|When the movie came out I had no interest.  I though, &#34;oh great, another fighting movie&#34;. Little did I know how great this movie would be. I initially rented the movie on a lonely movie night and it was an instant buy!
140006922X|5.0|Like many, I purchased this book after the recent Fox News interview of Aslan. Even had I not seen the interview, I probably would have bought it, as I am very interested in the history of Jesus, and how his life changed the course of history.  As a Jew, I am particularly interested - as the gospels were used to justify centuries of persecution of Jews.  I found this book riveting and compelling - and it is a must read for anyone of any faith.  It definitely questions many of the \\"gospel truths\\" about Jesus that we have all grown up with.  I can see why the thesis of this book upsets certain people.  But after all, for thousands of years, people thought the world was flat, or that people of darker skin were inferior ... Read this book, and decide for yourself what is true and what is not.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I just felt like I was getting good when the game was over, I am now addicted and need more.
B0061S073A|5.0|It's greater  spesially when you have  a kid that open  any app. With this app you don't have to worry.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Every time I think of Emma Watson, I think o the harry potter movies. She really emerges from that wizard role and does a great job.  I saw this movie because I had nothing else to see and had to buy it! Highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B00BRUZ5WA|5.0|Get this album, you won't be sorry. Fantastic rhythms and tunes throughout. Bought it a few months ago, played full album countless times since.
B003JHKORK|1.0|The first movie was horrible. Many main areas of the book were missing as well as a few important characters that played an important roll in the storyline. I hated﻿ it to be honest, I am going to see Sea of Monsters tomorrow just because I am I HUGE fan of the series. Maybe it will be an improvement, maybe not. Don't get me wrong, the books are great! Just don't waste your time watching the first film if you are expecting ANYTHING close to the book... Just feel sorry for Rick Riordan. :(
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was an amazing sequel to the equally amazing Ender's Game. I don't recommend it to novice readers due to its often time difficult to fully understand thought actions and reasonings. All in All a great book for read looking for a great plot and amazing, twisty storyline
B00004R84J|1.0|The DVD produces a message on screen &#34;This product may not be viewed in your region.&#34;  Apparently it is coded to play only on players in Europe.  I bought this through Amazon, it was sold apparently from the UK, but it was mailed from Brussels, Belgium.  So it is useless.<br />Wasted purchase and shipping costs on a disc that is not playable in the western hemisphere.<br />The vendor should have specified that the DVD would  not play in some parts of the world.<br />Very disappointed.
1400052181|5.0|I am a tenacious Genealogy Researcher and enjoy anything to do with our U.S. History. I purchased The \\"Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" by Rebecca Skloot prior to it hitting the shelves. I totally hate reading but found this book so compelling and interesting that I completed it in 2 days. In spite of a stigma problem which makes reading difficult. Quickest I've ever read anything! I must say it was worth the time and money. I have the utmost respect for Henrietta and her entire Family who suffered horribly throughout all these years. She deserves the adoration of the World! Through Henrietta Lacks misfortunate suffering and eventual death, she has saved countless millions from the same destiny. (Polio virtually wiped from the faces of the World because of HELA Cells) God Rest your Soul, Henrietta Lacks.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I think this is a very useful program. There are a lot of features I am still learning, but I am finding ways to use it personally and professionally. I wish the kindle allowed speech to text notes as other platforms of Evernote allegedly do.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|Some great action sequences but sloppy plot. You can totally tell this movie was inspired by the Matrix. Three stars is generous.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|It kept my attention. It's not horribly difficult for a hidden objects game and is a good way to pass the time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really fun game.  Both my kids and I play the game.  They often fight over the Kindle so that they can play.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|it a really fun game I think that would be fun for kids because everyone likes killing stuff especially mutants
B009DCOU9S|5.0|These types of games are my favorites. You won't get bored with doing the same actions over and over. One time might be hidden objects, then mirror difference s,then various memory challenges to detective puzzles. Some were pretty easy to some that were rather difficult to figure out. But none<br />were impossible . Even though I completed this game, I still would play again later. Honestly, I didn't want it to end. Just hope I can find others just like it.<br /><br />Cherie C<br />Starfi5ve
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very fun and exciting...reminds me of Mario brothers and I love playing that game just as I do this one!
B008NW67E0|5.0|i dont have the cd but i have heard all of these songs an  they are truely AMAZING i became obsessed with this band around new years because my friend made me listen to \\"I Will Wait\\" and the first time i thought it was ok but then i started listening to it and listening to it hhen eventually wanted to hear more songs and then i heard the cave and then i wanted to know backstories and so Mumford and Sons changed my view of bands and they pretty much just changed my life and usually by now i have moved on to another band, like beoore them i was hooked on taylor swift or the lumineers and before them it was selina gomez and before her it was the civil wars and i would be on those people for a few weeks and then move on but i have been hooked on mumford and sons for 7 months now or probably more haha they are an ammaaazzzzzing band and if you by this cd or listen to their songs maybe they will hhange your life too  :)

1623420148|5.0|To say I devoured this book is an understatement. It was refreshing and a different twist on a love story. I love how we got Drew's point of view through the whole thing. The way it was written was brilliant and really engaging. This is definitely going on the favorites shelf for me to read again!  Drew + Kate = Forever  Who would have thought a man whore would change his ways over meeting a woman in a bar who he knew nothing about? I love how she challenged him and didn't put up with his crap! There was no cliffhanger, but there is a book 2. I wonder if its Dee Dee's book. She was real intriguing and would love to read about her!  *follow my blog for more reviews!  [...]
0064471837|5.0|I cannot put into words how much I loved this book. This was the first book that I read of Garth Nix and after reading all of his other wonderful books, this one is still my favorite. It's just packed with everything. Its all genres packed into one, its so diverse that it really blows your mind. The world of Sabriel is just massive and he can go on for years writing stories about it, and that is just why I loved this book, its an never ending story in many ways. Just buy the book and see for yourself.
B00A8Z6KN8|4.0|I like listening to this music and it definitely has it's place.  It has good flow and you can picture parts of the movie as you listen to it.<br />The movie was an adventure, so I remember the music being faster and more aggressive.  While it does have tracks that have those qualities, a lot of the tracks are slower.  They're still great tracks, but it goes to show how skewed your perception can be when you are engrossed in a movie.  I'm still happy I bought it and I listen to it plenty.
B00465I17E|5.0|I love most of Denzel Washingtons movies but this one is one of my favorites so far. The intellectual part of it is very interesting and the story of how discriminate people were towards these young students was very good, as was the acceptence by an ivy league school to host them.

B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|The story of \\"Scarface\\" begins with a novel of the same name, written in 1929 by tragically short-lived Armitage Trail (Maurice Coons.) His novel was inspired by the exploits of  Depression Era gangster Alfonso \\"Al\\" Capone, who was nicknamed `Scarface.' The novel was adapted to the screen production of the 1932 film \\"Scarface,\\" directed by Howard Hawks. The old film is still an underground hit with movie buffs but the 1983 version most certainly takes the cake. It became \\"iconic,\\" for the lack of a better word. It was relevant, populated with characters and action to which the modern audience could relate. After the 1983 \\"Scarface\\" finished shooting, it was no longer just a \\"remake.\\"<br /><br />If you ever happen to participate in a \\"Scarface\\"-themed game of Jeopardy, and you've read this book, I think it's a safe bet that you are going to win.

I suppose it does take an Oxford-educated man (who, by his own admission, watched \\"Scarface\\" 200 times) to write a book about the pun-ultimate gangster movie that will have such a depth of information. This guide goes way beyond just listing trivia. For example, here's a tentative comparison of the main characters of Macbeth and Scarface:<br /><br />\\"...the audience is watching a flawed, evil man, a monster who happens to be a captivating, silver-tongued devil saying what we sometimes wish we had the nerve to say to people. Tony Montana and Macbeth are fantasy characters who defy the natural order of things. Their problem is that they expect too much out of life.\\"<br /><br />There is a detailed comparison of the 1932 and 1983 films, down to the conception of the hero and the visual palette.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there's even a scene by scene description with notes and even continuity errors.<br /><br />There is so much information and analysis here in this guide, it's hard to put it all in a short review.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It is well written and produced, great cast, fine screenplay. It's one of the few films from 2012 that I'll probably rent again. Very good!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  I just want more from Mr. Hosseini. I will read anything he wants to write about because I know it will be a well crafted, human, informative story. Like Kite Runner....and like A Thousand Splendid Suns.....
B000GY729M|1.0|i just listened to this entire album for the first time. i own and have enjoyed hot fuss, so i'm not out to bash the group. unfortunetely, i'm going to toss another 1 star review onto the pile. i don't have any profound insights as to why it sucks, but i'll echo some of the other reviews: headache inducing, vocals and backing tracks don't mesh, stupid lyrics, nothing fun about it--especially not compared to hot fuss, blatant copying of various musicians including springsteen. it's painfully, painfully obvious where they're imitating much better artists.<br /><br />plainly put, this album sucks. i'm just glad i heard it for free on rhapsody and didn't drop any money.
B00BRBIA6C|3.0|Let's face it. That's the truth. ABBA fans are so rabid and starved for product they would gush over Agnetha singing or doing a dramatic reading of a phone book. She is, as usual, in perfect voice...intonation, pitch...everything is perfect. I do love her. But she deserves so much better material than this. Nothing bad here, nothing offensive. Just overall bland and generic songs she tries her best to lift them vocally out of their mediocrity. A Herculean task that unfortunately falls flat. Gary Barlow, an amazing talent, probably would have made this a great project had he been given the complete reign as songwriter and producer here. But...just to hear her voice again is undoubtably a pleasure.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I feel like Harris was just trying to wrap things up. She wasn't true to the characters and the plot was convoluted. This book is a betrayal of the passion, fire, and humanity she had previously written into each of them. I would have given only 2 stars, but I just couldn't do it...
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I gave 5 stars do to what you get for your money. I know some people have given this product a bad review do to quality, but I think the quality for the price is great.  it would cost you a minimum of $30 at BestBuy or,Target for that matter. But I  haven't seen and any camera bags under $40 at either place. So it a moot point.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Staying up each night to watch &#34;just one more episode&#34;  got me pretty worn out, but I loved it.  My only issue is the ending of Season 3.  I am really upset with the producers and am not even sure that I want to continue with Season 4 when it comes out because it was so disappointing!
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Reminds me of the Girl with the Dragon tattoo series.  Very compelling and I would recommend it to any avid reader.

0062014536|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Lauren Oliver’s writing. So, I was very excited to receive an ARC of the final book the Delirium Trilogy, Requiem.<br /><br />Though very bittersweet, this book really struck a chord with me. It had just enough intense scenes in it, but it also had plenty of emotional parts as well. It really trapped my attention, which is impressive, since lately all dystopian novels seem all too similar and tend to bore me. I think part of the charm was the alternating POVs. At first it felt very out of place and foreign, since the previous books in the series all had one POV, but once I became accustomed to it, it really helped the story line stay fresh and interesting. Having two differ narrators with two very different perspectives on the situation help you sympathize with the character on a whole different scale than before.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Lauren Oliver’s writing, this book will not disappoint you.<br />I give Requiem 5 out of 5 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just like a real horse. It is a fun game and deserves five stars. I love it and cant stop playing
B00785P2QC|5.0|nice graphics, gameplay and commerce that lets you earn cash from the crop to the mouth. Would recommend to anyone that likes these type of games.
B002LHX624|5.0|according to my grandson, this is a very enjoyable book.  it was the last one he needed in the series so far.  he highly recommends them.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Had me laughing out loud! Fun twist on perspective. I strongly recommend this book for a light fun read. Will gladly suggest it to my friends.
B00973DDN2|5.0|Just a fantastic underrated album. Every song is reminiscent of Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen in a great way. Great buy.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Real life characters, in real life situations, played out of history! With each season the changing times for Lark Rise and Candleford  people also grew into the season 3 topper that any nation can look back in their own history of change and relate too. Very well presented, glad I watched all three seasons.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wonderful summer time read. Makes me want to hike the pct. Would like to read another book by this author.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|game is. alright cheesey. voice acting but keeps me interested in the plot,  colorful game,  easy puzzles, but the voice acting needs.to be better.
B003YUNKUU|4.0|A bit on the small side.  I found these shoes to be nicely made and can wear them without socks, but they run small and I would recommend ordering a half size or possibly a full size up from what you regularly wear.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is brilliant in blending of the new technology available to film makers these days with the perceived james bond musts.<br />Action packed with so almost unbelievable bond antics
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The product itself is nice, compact package, it sort of just works. It has a few quirks, probably a combination of older LCD TV (46&#34; Insignia 1080P 120Hz LCD) and networking/driver.<br /><br />Pros: Small package, works (does what it says), inexpensive. The provide the USB cable and wall plug.<br /><br />Cons:  There is a small delay when watching on a laptop while streaming to TV, no biggie but noticeable. *Requires* power. This is not bad by itself, but in my TV, plugging the USB into the TV caused my other HDMI to output no audio (I guess its a TV problem, rather than a device issue); however this caused me to have to use the provided USB power plug, which I try to avoid. Last, It failed to install from my desktop, but using a laptop worked fine (I opened a ticket with them). It sort of needs a WiFi adapter available. I can still see the device from my Chrome on Win 8.  I was surprised that the support is a bit lackluster. Even dev unlocking has been a bit challenging.<br /><br />Where does it fit? Well it's hard. I have an Xbox and a WD TV Live Plus box. I simply thought this would grant me wireless media streaming, but it requires some sort of mechanism to trigger it (Cast from Chrome, or from an Android device). The items I already own do this for me and more. I used it once or twice and that is it. It would be nice if I could navigate Netflix from within the device or stream from PC to this device (HTPC style). But that is not what was advertised and its not what it does.
0770435726|1.0|This is the first book I've read by this author and I won't be looking for any more.  I really tried to like but honestly it just never \\"took off\\".  I felt like I was wandering in a maze that kept going around and I couldn't get out.  I guess the author never did make me believe anything that was in the book and I really need to at least believe the premise and the characters or I just give up.  I'm so glad that I got it for free otherwise I would NOT be a happy camper.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|The set is fantastic. It comes in a very sturdy box, with a heavy-duty instructional guide. Truly some of the nicest packaging in the Lego catalog. I've purchased everything from the Superman sets to the Monsters Lego sets, and none of them are packaged this high-quality. Just be careful you aren't over-spending. The set should only be $35ish. You can order directly thru the Lego website for $34.99 and if you are club member (free), you can get special deals and earn points.<br /><br />That said, it's really a wonderful \\"toy\\". I'm an adult who has a bit of trouble relaxing (Type A), so being able to take my mind off work for an hour or two and build something is a treat. The added bonus is that this is a great replica of a fantastic film.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Was worried how I would enjoy this as I have seen the musical show many times. Was extremely pleased with the result. Very believable characters, impressed with all the voices and the portrayal of the main characters was masterfully done.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|No, it's not American Gods. It was a good read, however. Neil Gaiman can take me places that no other author can make as real. The 3 women were reminiscent of the Fates - the girl, the mother and the crone. I couldn't shake the feeling that the young boy was our author himself, telling his own story. All in all, glad that I bought this, although when you wait so long for anything, it's never quite as perfect as you hope it will be.
8866130915|5.0|I bought the 2012, and when it was done, I bought the 2013. I'll buy the 2014 as well. I love all my Moleskine notebooks.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app very accurate and works well on my kindle. Easy to read and check.I like the layout and my options to see the whole week.<br /><br />.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Worth it . I think this is a mindless FUN game that can be played by kids all the way up to elderly. I watch tv after a long day and play this at the same time. I play with my grandkids as well.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a fun game. I would have liked to have some instructions at the beginning but wasnt too difficult to catch onto.
0316247545|5.0|I picked this book up for my kids 7 th bday. She loves it and reads it. Her friends come over and they all go bananas over this book. Most of our books collect dust But not this one. Definitely worth it price.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Very intriguing. Ready for book 3! This book is a well written sequel to The Selection. Readers will enjoy it.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The third book was even more difficult to keep me interested. Then first was wonderful and full of mystery. The second mildly borring and predictable. Hard to believe about a book with this kind of content.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I Love it, it's just like playing uno for real but easier to keep up with your hand and rules! Lol
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was very funny and then the book was loosing the excitement.so I didn't like it much at all
B005K17RU0|4.0|There are still many places where my smartphone can barely get a signal. In these areas, the app will load the basic weather report: minus humidity, hour predictions, etc..<br />It's very useful when planning outdoor activities.
B008476HBM|1.0|This book did not download. I gave the product more than enough time to download and it never appeared on my home screen.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Quite the interesting short read. Informative and inspiring. I find many of Teslas ideas to be fascinating and would love some of them implemented into society like free electricity simply from plugging into the soil.
B000QFQE4U|2.0|The Movie was way too long. Spike Lee seemed to want to focus on the drugs and violence more than on the actual historical significance of Malcolm X. Also the director effects were confusing and made the story line hard to follow along with. There was no distinction between what was going on in Malcolm's head and what was really happening. It was blasphemous on purpose and it felt like a cheap \\"Scarface\\" movie at certain times. I understand when speaking about Malcolm X it is hard to keep a G rating, but many of the scenes had no affect on the actual movie and contributed to the much wasted time.
0064471837|5.0|I give this book, and this series 5 stars. First read in the 8th grade, it is a book for almost all ages. Garth Nix has written a series that can be reread constantly, with something new being gleaned each time. The characters grow through their adventures, and the story is hard to put down. From Mogget's dry wit to Sabriel's heroism, to Touchstone's dark past-this story will surprise you and leave you wanting more. It's ok though, because there is more! The story continues in two more books, but Sabriel is a fantastic start to a world filled with magic on one side and science on the other, to a story of love and power and the ever-present Dead. I can't rate this book highly enough.
B004GXZ69W|3.0|I got this mouse and the less expensive Anker wireless mouse because I have a trigger finger. Not only did this not solve the problem, it caused an additional problem with my thumb. I ended up going back to a traditional mouse and using it left handed. Unfortunately, I missed the return window and now I am stuck with it.<br /><br />The idea made perfect sense, but it did not solve my issue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't like it I love it you can change character buy coins get keys its so fun and so far i got 10,000,000 coins and 500 keys its great you should download it
B00AB7HESI|3.0|it wouldn't let me enter on the notebook thing al I couldn't play :( does somebody own a kindle and now how? :/
034580404X|5.0|I love these books!!! I'm only half way done with the 1st book, but plan on reading it soon! I've recommended this book to everyone I know!!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Takes a long time but that's the fun of it. At least it will keep you occupied for at least 2-3 hours. Is there going to be a second one?
0099579944|5.0|The book was great of course. It was delivered ahead of schedule. I was about to read it within a week and now I've given it away for someone else's enjoyment.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I have listened to this album probably thirty times and it is awesome to work out with along with their other albums too.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tunein Radio is easily among my favorite apps, both on iPhones and Android platforms. The large number of stations and podcasts provide ample content while the interface makes it easy to find things I enjoy. It's especially nice if you're aware of quality independent radio stations which provide a richness of content depth well beyond what you might find on commercial radio - and more suited to the zeitgeist than what you'd find on pandora (due to human curation of playlists). I don't like that they've increased the price of the pro version, but the only difference is the ability to record.
B0026QC0YU|3.0|For an older movie, this isn't bad.  It's not the most action-packed or suspenseful movie, but it moves along.  Much like Hawaii 5-0, I watched it because I like the theme music.  For a Tom Cruise flick, you could do worse.
B000SNW0HA|5.0|I can’t believe I'm just now listing to this...it feels like I have never heard of DP and finding a new group to listen too.
B00103584Y|5.0|This was my favorite film that I watched during a community college film class, and after wanting to see it again for a while, I decided to buy it on Blu-ray.  It's an exciting movie with an interesting structure, and definitely worth the purchase.
B0063M22QO|2.0|It was too easy. I enjoy Mahjong HD better and it was better on my HD.  My wife did not care for it either.
B00E8B1358|3.0|I was not impressed with the (Spoiler alert) death of Hawk...that was weak.  Just because it happens in the cartoons does not mean it happens in the real movie.  Especially the way he died; these guys are going thru so much and he dies by exploding truck?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was lucky enough to snag one of these a few minutes after it was announced. Amazon shipped it incredibly fast and setup was a breeze. Sure you need to power it but really it's not a huge deal. Its still smaller and much more compact than an Xbox. I will say that currently the support is lacking but that is only because the product was just released and people are still struggling to get their hands on it.<br /><br />In 6 months or so we will have dozens of apps that take advantage of the Chromecast and the possibilities will still be endless.<br /><br />For 35 dollars you really cannot go wrong. And if you were lucky enough to receive the netflix promotion then it's even cheaper.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this product almost solely based on price.<br /><br />Buy it, try it, and if you dont love it, put it away for a few months and come back when more apps support it.<br /><br />This is the start of something great.
0670026557|4.0|heard it all before and couldn't finish book. not sure why others have signed on for the online college course.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|He continues to set the tone for the DC Universe and I hope he will continue on the next Man of Steel: World’s Finest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It has the places it has HD it is the best<br />You have to get it if you don't you wouldn't be satisfied
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|First of all, the title of the book alone had me. I remember going to see Scarface the Movie at the now closed State & Lake theater here in Chicago and seeing it multiples times after at the theater, on cable(regular editions and edited), and DVD. So i considered myself an expert on the movie. How wrong i was. Considering the climate at the time with the building drug trade, the reluctance to film made sense. But what was especially insightful for me was the scene by scene breakdown. So much went into each one that I could've never guessed. Damian Stevenson did an excellent job of putting this book together and delving deep in the legendary work that is the movie \\"Scarface\\".
B000TENK4K|5.0|I can’t believe I'm just now listing to this...it feels like I have never heard of DP and finding a new group to listen too.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Addictive writing. Engaging story. Tender-funny and poignant at times especially about people who are not 'conventional'. The story maintained its lively pace to the very end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much but I wish it were more like the computer version its still a awesome game
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Watched this movie on prime before we went to go see the sequel and my kiddo loved it...mainly the minions.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I got this at a very good price from Amazon compare to other retailer. With Blu-ray version, sound effect and picture quality is outstanding.<br /><br />Me and kids have already enjoyed and watched these movies several times since arrival.
B001CDD84Y|2.0|In a movie like this, I expect lots of fun action and characters that I like. This movie did have a lot of fun action. The concept of \\"jumping\\" and its implications were pretty cool and at least partially explored. However, I just didn't like the main characters, especially the one played by H. Christensen. Perhaps it was his wooden acting, or just that the character didn't have many redeeming qualities, but I was kind of rooting against him, even though I equally disliked the \\"bad guys.\\" I kept watching, hoping that some character would become three-dimensional and at least partially likable, but it never happened, and I was just glad when it was over.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is awesome because if u are good at cross word puzzels then u should definatly get this app. And the best part about the app is its absolutely positivly FREE!!!!!!!!!
0618680004|5.0|It got shipped really fast! And the book came in flawless condition! I actually didn't need to buy this book as I had already read it at the library. Nevertheless, I thought it'd be nice to have a physical copy of this soon-to-be classic work of Richard Dawkins. If you haven't read this book, go read it. It's very insightful, an eye opener for those who have a &#34;little doubt&#34;.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Bruce Lee will live forever in this Blu Ray disc. Nobody flights like him and all stunts are real. The story line is too simple but the fighting make up for it. This movie will be enjoy by generations after generations.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Just the right amount of difficulty to keep you coming back for more. Kills boredom quick and is fun for hours at a time.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Great series from one of my best TV shows. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Peter Falk, you won't be disappointed.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Along with The Beatles '67-70 and the White Album are all your basic fan needs. This is the definition of must have.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I remember it from my old tv that we had in high school but the hi def makes it all seem to kitzchy and funny. The ear pieces look like blackberries and communicators look exactly like cell phones and Gene Roddenberry was a genius.
1616551607|4.0|This was a fun book to reminisce with. I love playing the final fantasy games so I had a great time going through this collection of amazing artwork. The only regret I have now is that I never played a lot of the early games that the artwork here depicts.<br /><br />This is one of those books you just want to stare at, noticing all the details. You really come to appreciate the world. It has left me wanting to go play the games. So, when I have some free cash, I get to head over to the used game store to see what I can find. So here are some points of interest I found for the various games art the artistic use shown. Please note, I am not an artist by any means, not do I know the terminology. I am just a gaming fan who happens to like artwork as well.<br /><br />Final Fantasy 1-1987: Some art is very detailed-worthy of wall art. Others sketchy, quick drawings. Both color, paint, pencil, etc. A nice blend of work shown.<br /><br />FF2- 1988: Lots of collages. Edgier work. Covers the names of beloved characters. which was a nice bonus.<br /><br />FF3-1990: Maturity in color use. Some outfits were too busy however, in color and style, showing trends to close to late 80's look in real life. Fitting for the time but a bit too much to look at now.<br /><br />FF4-1991: Richer color use. Bold blues, reds, greens,etc vs pastels. More dragons which was fun to see being a dragon fan.<br /><br />FF5-1992: Solid colors, and schemes with red and black being predominant with other accented colors. Not all characters were this way. Such as Gogo the mimic who was extremely colorful! Drawings for this game also shows more battle scenes.<br /><br />FF6-1994: The best blend of work so far in my opinion. A maturing blend of styles. Also, the characters seem more expressive in this one. Plus there are pictures of Mog, who is just adorable!<br /><br />FF7-FF10 ??????????????????? I do not know where these are. Please note my copy of this was a review copy, not the finished work but for some reason it does not show the last third of the artwork. It seriously just stopped at page 383! I do not know if it is either a glitch in my copy or because it was only meant for review and being this isn't a novel I don't need to see everything. I do not know.<br /><br />My only real complaint is I wanted information. More that just a character name. Final Fantasy is about plot. Give me some information about the characters. Monster info would be nice too. Don't get me wrong the art selection is incredible, worthy of 5 stars, but I like to know a bit about what I am looking at, especially since I haven't played all the games. Oh well. Still I has so much fun viewing this. The artwork is so detailed! A very enthralling book to view.<br /><br />Special Thanks to Diamond Book distributors and Netgalley for providing me with a copy of this.  This book was given in exchange for a fair and honest review.me reason it does not show the last third of the artwork. It seriously just stopped at page 383!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|The whole family loves playing this game but it does have some glitches every one in a while.  Frustrating at times but we still like to play often.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|This movie had it's moments.  I don't know that I would watch it a second time, but I can at least say now that I have seen it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and was very happy I could get it for a very reasonable price on Amazon.
B004GYY714|5.0|I would recommend this app to everyone.  You can listed to stations all over the world.  The sound is clear.  The choices are innumerable.  There's nothing about it I don't like.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Great Deal, for $70 all 5 seasons of the Big Bang Theory in Blu-ray with DTS sound quality.  Copy right still from Warner Bros., even though distributed from UK.  I like how each season fits on 2 Blu-ray discs.  Recommend to all Big Bang Theory Fans!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After the traumatic events concluding the first book Anastasia Steele enters a long dark night of the soul. Loosing her self in her new job and racked with emptiness of her loss, it takes the event of her friend José's show to pull her back into the light, only to learn that she is not the only one suffering. Thus starts the second book in the fifty shades series. Yet another roller coaster ride of passion, intrigue, and surprises that enchant the mind and fill the heart(and heat the loins). It is such a captivating tale that I could hardly put it down. From skeletons of the past to promises of a bright shining future, you cant help but enjoy the ride, no matter how bumpy it gets.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I just started using this app, but so far I really like it.  There are many good options.  I wish there was an easier way to turn it off after the alarm goes off.  I wanted to use the &#34;shake&#34; feature to turn it off but I read a review where the person found shaking the Kindle to turn off the alarm caused some technical problems, so I'm not wlling to try that.  This will be great when traveling.  I like that the volume is very low in the beginning and increases until it is turned off.
B00AEFY3MC|4.0|I hate science fiction, but my husband, a scientist, talked me into watching this movie.  It is silly, funny, and a relaxing choice for a change.  I still don't like science fiction, but I do like satires and parodies, and Galaxy Quest fits into these genres.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game ... cutest run type game yet .. great graphics. Will be playing this for a long time. Only downfall is I can not get updates to download.
0385523394|5.0|I thought this was a well written book. I had read a few reviews online about the author talking more about her relationship with Larry than the experiences in the prison. I do not believe those posts. I thought the book was all about what it was like in prison for Piper. I really enjoyed reading it! I even felt what it must have been like to be locked up. She talks about how she felt, what was happening on a day to day basis, and how they found their own ways to cope. She also touched on how things work in the prison as far as programs that are offered, (or not offered).<br /><br />The only thing is, if you have watched Netflix version of this book you will realize some of the stories Netflix tells are either made up or exaggerated...which should be expected when they turn a book into a series. They have to make the TV version entertaining. Piper is much milder and does not get in trouble like on the Netflix series.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I have no problems running all 6 cores of this particular unit up to 3.8ghz at standard voltage with some extra cooling installed.<br /><br />I could probably drop back to 4 cores and pass 4ghz if needed, but for what I do with my computer:<br />I use it stock...with cool and quiet on, and enable turbo boost.<br /><br />It makes for great general purpose workstation with plenty of cores on the side for running a modest Linux Virtual Machine when needed and having lots of Windows Applications open at once while watching a movie in a second monitor :)<br /><br />I'm a hobbyist with software like Blender and Gimp...for the extremely low cash layout of this processor it is VERY adequate for experimenting with 3d rendering.<br /><br />I enjoy the Occasional 3d game (WoW, Everquest, Console Ports like Assassin's Creed/Batman)...this is plenty of processor for the titles I enjoy.<br /><br />If you have an old AMD 2X or 3X rig laying around that can take this processor as an upgrade...it's money well spent :)
1936608898|5.0|This book is eye opening, and I've never felt better than I did while on the Whole30. Though I've recently fallen off of the Whole30 wagon, I can't wait to get started again. I will say that the lifestyle is hard to maintain. It is a bit expensive, and hard in a social environment. I currently live with my parents (recent college grad), but plan on starting back up in the lifestyle when I move on my own in the spring. I think it would be much more sustainable.<br /><br />Update (3/31/2014):<br /><br />6 months later, and my life has changed drastically for the better. I'm in the middle of my 4th Whole30 (This is a Lenten round, so more like Whole45). I feel better all around, and I actually love what I'm eating. I still struggle with my sugar demons, and I'm not perfect, but I'm learning to love myself. The Whole30 pushed me to this point, and I could never thank Melissa and Dallas enough.
0064471837|5.0|With the premise of this book in mind, I wasn't so sure it would be something I would enjoy - but I was really pleasantly surprised.  I usually dislike books which heavily use undead creatures because the creatures are typically so hollow and more resemble natural disasters with crude, carnal motivation - rather than sentient, calculating antagonists. Additionally, death is usually a passive verb ... something that happens to you while you are busy and only the aftermath of the verb is acknowledged. It was actually quite nice to see death as both a place and a process - an inert set of rules and tiers that can be tampered with with the correct tools or powers - but it isn't broken if its influence is escaped - much like gravity. Bells can work with it but can't permanently change it, it carries on, as it always has. This layer of dimension was entrancing and took away and sense of heavy morbidity, despite the fairly copious carnage throughout the book.<br /><br />My favourite addition to this story is Mogget - a creature who seems somewhat bitter but rather resigned to his fate so much that a pure feline nature overtakes him from time to time - however, he is not unlike what one would suspect a sentient cat would be like anyway. His abrasiveness is forever tempered by his amusingly contrasting, adorable appearance which he may both resent and exploit.<br /><br />This is a charming read that appeals to the senses so much that you may be tempted to hold the world in your hands for a can of fish.  ^^
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great second in the series. It continued the original through while engaging a new and exciting storyline. I look forward to reading the next in the series.
B000002LSV|1.0|Very disappointed with the sound quality, seems it was recorded at a distance, lost all the quality ZZ Top is known for, guitars sounded weak, and generally just bad, buy another album
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing, the graphics are awesome. It's a good game if you ever wanted your own horse. It's also really fun and keeps you busy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've just reread this series for the second time because I'm so excited for the second movie to come out. So obviously I'm going to give the book the full five stars. And like the second book I would say that this book is good for ages 12 through 25.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Baldacci never disappoints though I did prefer the Camel Club series, I will follow up The Innocent with The Hit and look forward to many more great books.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It is okay up to the last level on each part and then it's impossible to complete that challenge which is frustrating.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Great game, definitely download !! Cute monsters, great battles, good story line, great game! I'm seventeen and I enjoy it, I'm sure you will too!!! I guaranty you will love this game, if you don't, you can always delete it, just download it and love it!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am the type of person who rarely reads and often loathes reading. However this book was just spectacular and I actually finished it!!
B001NIA27E|5.0|Dante's Peak is a great movie. I enjoyed it on tv and wanted a copy so I could watch it on movie nights at home. Easy to watch and enjoyable!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is like the new Harry Potter! It's a great book and a must have. I've been looking for a new series that'll make me reading all day and I think I found it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm really addicted to this game. I'm not sure if its sad or not because I'm 20, but oh well lol.
B0072AYJFI|5.0|I have read the Abhorsen trilogy about once a year since they first came out. I can't get enough of Nix's world or his characters. These books are usually considered YA because of the age of the characters--18-ish--and the coming of age themes they explore, but I'd hesitate to classify them so neatly. Yes, you can (and should) give them to your teens to read, and they can justifiably be found in high school libraries. But there's more to these books than that. The characters are deep and resonant, and each one will connect in a different way to anyone who has ever struggled to meet responsibilities that seem overwhelming, to fit in in a world where you don't feel like you belong, to figure out who you really are when everyone around you thinks they have the answer to that, or to open your mind in the face of new evidence or ideas. On top of all that stunning character work is the world itself: a modern, Enlightenment world of philosophy and science living side by side but slightly out of sync with a world of magic, legend, and spirit--both of them utterly real, and both of them needing each other in order to triumph over evil.<br /><br />Another thing I love about Nix's worlds, both this one and the other-dimensional world of the Keys to the Kingdom series--is that they are centered around the power of words. In the Keys series, whole creatures and landscapes are literally made of words, and only the right words provide the power to liberate or limit. In the Abhorsen series, the whole of existence is based on the Charter, the metaphysical series of sacred words and symbols that focus and limit the forces of magic in the world. There is Charter Magic, a Tao-like force into which people are baptized, and in which people share for the good of all nature and humanity, and then there's Free Magic, those beings and forces that refuse to discipline themselves or to limit themselves for the sake of the common life of all people and creatures. Each is controlled and expressed by words--Charter Marks, rune-like symbols that convey power. The Ideal being presented is that those who submit themselves to the common good, and those who pursue only selfish goals no matter the cost to others, each perform their acts of power through the ultimate, incontrovertible power of words. And really...how else is it ever done?<br /><br />I have recommended this series to countless teens and adults, and will continue to do so. In fact, I haven't read it in a while, so I may just get my own books out and read it again, for the third time this year.d by words--Charter Marks, rune-like symbols that convey power.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie i have seen it like twenty times at least. It isn't your average musical. This is a funny heart warming film that everyone will love.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Game is super fun. I have been playing it all morning. It is so much fun. I would 're commend this super fun game to all my friends.
B0026IUXME|5.0|I would say it's a classic (which is), if it were not that it's stuff that happened for real, back when most of us weren't even born. This movie caused me tons of sorrow and I also felt compelled to read part of the real diary from the man himself, Mr. Szpilman. There's just so much anyone can learn from a movie like this. What it means to be separated from your family knowing that they are all going to be killed. What it means to live in the direst of condition for the rest of your days. What it means to be humiliated by these monstrously insensitive individuals called 'Nazi'.  There's nothing that anyone can write to express all these ideas. This is a movie that all grown ups should see, to grow up more. Stop watching Marvel movies, stop watching movies to entertain yourself, and watch this movie to learn something. I learned to try, everytime I am angry or sad about something that has to do with my own disappointments, to remember what it must have meant to be one of the victims of Nazism. Go to wikipedia and read the article about Czesawa Kwoka and you too will learn to tend to complain a lot less.  Nazism. The shame of humanity.  UPDATE: I have now read the whole diary. I must say, there's no substitute for that. It's too easy to watch a movie, you should read the book too.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game. Thanks for the game and hope the people that don't get it and  you will have fun.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is one of the best games on my kindle. This is a very good time killer and can distract you from some stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Everyone should get this it's amazing super cute outfits amazing graphics I recommend it if you love minions you'll love it
147674355X|5.0|When I heard \\"Just a Kiss\\" from Lady Antebellum, it thought it was the perfect song from Holder to Sky! He was so gentle and tender with Sky despite his bad boy exterior! I found myself holding my breath everytime he was close enough to kiss her, but had just enough restraint to pull back!! \\"The most perfect Non-Kiss\\" in history!
1846573793|5.0|I listened to Fifty Shades of Grey on audio book.<br />It brings back romantic memories of my own, with my husband when we first met.<br />It is well written, and very graphic.<br />Had to have the next in the series, Fifty Shades Darker!!!<br />The cd's were in perfect condition.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I bought this USB extension to set up my in home motion capture studio by using multiple PlayStation EYE cameras. It needed a long cable to extend across the room and this works perfect without any slowdown and no frame dropping. Just what I need!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love how u have to evolve the virus to kill I played it free and loved it I had no problem paying
B00C2IF9SQ|4.0|Looking forward to reading this.....saw Dominique talk about her book as well as her sister that she did not know that she had
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|If you really want one, I would WAIT until after they fix their quality problems.<br /><br />I really want to like this device.  I have had 2 devices in less than 30 days, both died within a few days.<br /><br />The few days it worked, I liked the heart rate measure, loved the sleep analysis as I found that very eye opening how much time I really spend asleep.  I found the steps a bit inaccurate; mostly because my unit would shut off during workouts, which defeats the purpose of having it.  The ones I received had battery life issues, they would only last 10 hours without a charge.  For other reviewers they say that they last 10+ days, so what I see here is an issue with their manufacturing process, they have poor and spotty quality.<br /><br />I could (almost) deal with that IF their customer support made up for it, but it doesn't.  They ignore their customers.  With the first device I reached out to Withings customer support- within 2 days of receiving the device- when I hit issues.  They quickly responded and replaced the device within a week.<br />The second device worked great out of the box. It worked for 4 days before dying.  I had to charge it at least once a day, as it had poor battery life.  Eventually it just died, and won't take a charge.  (The same issue that happened to the first one.)  I again reached out to Withings support (via support Ticket)- Last Week.  I have heard nothing back.  I asked for a fix or a return, I guess when you say you want to return you get ignored.  I've been updating my support ticket each day asking for a status, no response.  It's unfortunate.  As I didn't get a response I can only assume either a) they are overwhelmed with support issues due to poor quality, or b) they don't care about their customers.  Either way it's a problem.<br /><br />Right now, it's been less than 30 days sine I received mine, I've had 2 broken ones, and I basically have a a $99 piece of plastic sitting on my desk.<br />Not worth the money or aggravation.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Well written story with great cast all around and good ending. Certain people have said this was a mashup of other sci fi flicks but that can be said of any film in any genre. I think it was an epic movie and in my opinion had a great soundtrack of classic rock and r&b music. Cruise rarely disappoints and can make even the worst writers look genius and olga K. from the bond film was great as well. As far as sci-fi goes, this film brings the genre back up unlike Prometheus which was an overall disappointment for most fans. I would buy this movie and that is a rare statement from me so give it a try for a movie with the perfect mix of action and storytelling that is just over 2 hours long and well worth your money!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love playing this card game with my kids on rainy days so imagine my surprise when it comes out on social media.....wohooo! My only problem is, I'm accepting coins but not knowing how to give them. Anything help?
B0091WAWTM|3.0|This is a strange movie. It was probably a bit innovative in 1973, when it was released, but today it's a bit of an anachronism. The ending is disturbing, which for some strange reason, makes it worth watching.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I enjoy a novel of magical mystery and thought this book, &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34; had some moments of magical intrigue. One of my top books in this genre is &#34;The Night Circus&#34; by Erin Morgenstern and though it's not quite right to compare the two, I felt this book fell a little short of expectation.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Lol, I love it. I love this game. It's challenging and definitely keeps me thinking. I have adhd, so any game that keeps my intention for more than 2 minutes is absolutely a game worth buying. My son loves it, too. Until the challenges become more difficult. I think he just gives up too easily, but it's as if he can't put it down, even if he can't figure it out right away.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game is very challenging. But easy enough that you don't get frustrated. I like that you don't have a time limit to finish each goal. I think it need a little more direction for the harder tasks, like the string task.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|You'll get so caught up in this game until you'll lose track of time until you complete it.  I wish it were longer!
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|Here's the scoop on this set: It's a bargain affair. It's a great deal, but for that reason, you can't expect many bells and whistles.<br /><br />What you get are the first 10 studio albums, in paper jackets that replicate the original sleeves. There are no inner sleeves, so if any artwork was originally there, it's not present in this set. I'm not a mastering dude or an audio snob, but the disks all sound fine: These weren't pristine recordings to begin with, so a little bit of grit doesn't bug me.<br /><br />What you don't get are any bonus tracks, commentary, extra photos, or liner notes. Heck, the artwork on the disks themselves are those old Warner Brothers CD templates that I haven't seen on a new release in 15 years. That said, I bought my copy new for $34.99 -- that's $3.50 a disk. So can I really complain about the no frills presentation? Am I entitled to more?<br /><br />The answer is, honestly, no: If I had paid $100 I'd expect more, but just to have these albums in their original mixes and nicely packaged is certainly worth 35 bucks. So complain all you want. It's cheap. And in the declining days of the music industry, this is probably the best you're gonna get. So learn to love it...the music is certainly a gas.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A good Star trek yarn, a new take on the ST:TOS crew and I liked what I saw. If you like Star Trek you most likely will enjoy this movie. There are several changes that long time Trek fan will notice but, these are explained in the movie. Not to spoil it there are several major differences  in the time line in the movie that differ from ST:TOS.<br />  I did not see this movie in a theater so my first viewing was on my TV. I paid eight dollars for this DVD and would have paid more.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi Hendrix is back with an album of unreleased tracks that satisfy even the casual fan.  I highly recommend it
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|One box gives every  Star Trek fan all five movies filmed with the ST:TOS cast.  The movies are presented in a crisp clean like new format and sound quality is great and the price was very reasonable.  The only objection that I have is that there are several promos at the start of each movie. you can always skip over these but as always I object to having to either watch or skip over promos to watch a movie.  It's just my feeling and others may not have this small gripe.  However the price and the packaging were a good value. I give this box set five stars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Never thought I'd like Downton Abbey as much as I did but it's wonderful!  The story and acting were done beautifully.  Love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such an addictive game for kids and adults alike! I love the minions! It's not like those other free games where you have to buy everything with real money to get anywhere in the game.
B00AEBB9GY|5.0|Great movie! The DVD and DVD case were in great condition, everything was perfect. Definitely met my expectations! Thank you!
067144901X|5.0|I have grown to love Sandra Boynton books. They are my daughter's favorite. At 15 months she knows moo, baa, oink, quack, neigh, ruff ruff, bow wow and meow all because of this book! I find Boynton books simplistic, and while that may not work for the TV toddler - my simplistic baby loves them and learns from them.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|This movie came in perfect condition. It definitely met my expectations, and I would buy it again. Great product and good price.
B00CEJ2H6K|4.0|This is a solid album. Not quite &#34;With Oden&#34; but still really good. There is some NWOBHM influence but still the overall sound is definitely Amon Amarth especially in to the later tracks.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|If you are a fan of the fantasy genre, this would be a strong recommendation. It has all the elements you could want: a unique world (even by today's fantasy standards), sophisticated characters, sophisticated plot and elements of surprise. It also doesn't depend on the sexual or graphic/shock elements some other fantasy novels (&#34;Game of Thrones&#34; :: cough ::) seems to lean heavily upon. Can't wait for the sequel!
B003HZGT32|4.0|This album has a peculiar -- but interesting in a good way -- upbeat tempo to it.  I kind of expect this sort of sound from Insomnium and noticed it really only a little bit on Above the Weeping World; it's definitely more pronounced on Across the Dark, where this element carries the album from &#34;Equivalence&#34; continuing seamlessly into &#34;Down With The Sun&#34; most of the way even through &#34;Into The Woods&#34; which maintains this galloping pace -- it's not doom/gloom/dreariness but an element of excitement which fades a little bit but doesn't entirely disappear in the last track, &#34;Weighed Down With Sorrow&#34;.  I really enjoy this album; metal for when I don't want thrash/speed/death/etc.  It's still metal, it's just a bit different vibe to it. Great overall album.
0345535421|5.0|games of thrones !!!!<br />The very best, just another 6000 pages to go and we'll know if Bran will walk again :)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I have a kindle fire and I downloaded it and it took forever to download. plus it gave me a virus I couldn't turn my kindle on for about a week.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|For example I lined these up...<br /><br />53<br />35 they both add up to 8 yet nothing happens....<br /><br />or<br /><br />37<br />4<br /><br />4+3 is 7 yet npthing happens.....this game is a piece of junk unless the instructions are just incorrect and theres another way of playin it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, It is so awesome.it is very addicting, I could play it all day long. The creators should make a Subway Surfers 2
0786962984|5.0|Great for a quick game at the table when you don't have more than 45 min to an hour. Very enjoyable.
B009NY43NY|4.0|it s so sad ive been reading these books for years and now its all over :( I think she rushed the ending but I liked the outcome! Bye Sookie!

B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME OF ALL TIME. MY FAVORITE GAME AND BEST OF ALL... MULTIPLAYER.YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME.DOWNLOAD IT ALREADY. I WOULD PAY $50 BUCKS FOR IT.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderfully sad, intelligent, enlightening, thought provoking and heartwarming! Every imaginable feeling can be found in this book. Take some time to experience this book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love playing this game. I can compete against friends &amp; family in the tournament &amp; it works well on my kindle.
1568814518|5.0|As a mathematician who dabbles in art, this book was a welcome addition to my library.  But you don't need to be good at math to appreciate the art or to make it.<br /><br />The designs are made from a variety of different papers.  Often the back of the design is just as interesting as the front.  The pictures are beautiful, showing off the texture of the designs and of the papers used to fold them.<br /><br />The instructions are detailed.  There are several basic types of folds that are explained.  More complex folds are built on that foundation.  As you might expect, there are diagrams for folding each design.  But there are also photographs showing each project in various stages of completion.<br /><br />Very, very well done!
B008BF9ZFM|4.0|\\"The Fishing Derby\\" by Author Peter Collier is a great children's book. I think it gives the younger reading audience an opportunity to experience what it is like for a variety of people who enter a fishing contest. The use of rhyme that the author has chosen to describe this fishing event is a great learning opprtunity.<br /><br />There is a neat cast of characters, such a Barnard Doubleday who is blind and can only fish with the help of his six year old daughter, Kate. This book also introduces children to the infamous way of telling fish stories when referring to the largest fish that always manages to get away. It seems that every time Larry's shares his story, the fish grows more and more. Emile also has his share of challenges even though he is using his lucky lure....it's no fun catching an old rubber boot. It's quite difficult to win a prize with this kind of catch.<br /><br />Yes...this little book is for early school age children or for a good story to be read to those that are unable to read it on their own. I agree with one of the other reviews...it would be great to have some illustrations in this book. It would definitely enhance the reading pleasure.<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00A53FXMC A Woman's Voice - Inspirational Short Stories - Volume 1]]
B0083Z614S|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much.<br />I didn't want it to end.<br />Characters brought from the pages of this book to whirl and twirl and change before my eyes.  The picture so real I felt myself bending to enter into the secret garden.<br />I think I will set this book aside to be read again.  I can't think it would ever get old.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|If you love classic Indiana Jones, you must see this movie.  It successfully merges the stories of a number of comic book stories. I'd say the screen play writer deserves the greatest reward, which says a lot based on the high quality of acting, story flow, direction, music, etc.  The uncanny valley effect is present but you get used to it fairly quick.
B004GYY714|4.0|The availbility of stations and different genre's from all over the country and the globe gives a listner and opprotunity to experience a multitude of music that is not heard on standard or satellite radio. Only wish all songs could be downloaded for purchase through Amazon.  Have really wanted to purchase a few songs that I had not heard in the smooth & classic jazz formats from little known or new artist that were not available.  Keep up the good work and I only wish I could take TuneIn along with me in my car.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|The first unit that I received I felt did not work correctly in Propellerhead Reason 6.5.  So I sent it back for another.  But it worked the same way.  Latter found out that Reason only records one track at a time.  My mistake.  Works great.  Get the latest drivers over the internet.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game dungeon hunter 3 is very fun and epic there is no actual campaign for the game but it is very fun if you want a game similar to this game then get dungeon hunter 4 because it has a campaign and is also a very fun game to play I enjoy it and hope you do to so get this game I love it
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Another good read from Khal d Hosseini. If readers like his other books they willcertainly like this as well. Again the amazing vast landscape of Afghanistan is set as the background.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Preatyy good game but invested points are hard to come by three days into it so fare so good no big problems. Except the invester points
044024630X|5.0|A good book and a fun read....I like all his novels and  I read them whenever I get a chance
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|For a long time I was very intrigued by Steven Erikson’s “Gardens of the Moon.”  The title, the cover, and especially the recommendations and reviews are what made me so eager to read it.  I enjoyed most of it, but he lost me in the end.  The ending had too many characters and battle scenes for me to follow.  All said, I am glad I read it and satisfied my curiosity.  If you are interested in Erikson, go ahead and try him, but for me, I will stick to a few less characters and plots.
0307719774|3.0|I will have to really decide whether or not I will be keeping this journal.  I love the idea of it and I love the questions asked.  What I DON'T LIKE is that the book is so tiny!  The amount of space to write for each year is literally a couple of lines and the book is more of a pocket size.  I should have read the dimensions of the book before ordering.  For some reason, I was thinking it would be sized 8&#34; x 11&#34; (like a regular sheet of paper) and you would have at least a page to write for each question.  To me a journal would be a place to write your thoughts and ideas thoroughly, not just a sentence or two.  They described this journal as a way to go back through the years and see how you answered the question of the day from year 1 to year 5.  How on earth will you be able to remember details of how you were feeling or what you were going through that day in 2 sentences?  I should have paid attention and actually took the time to look inside the book online when I shopped on Amazon.  Shame on me!  I was so excited to order the book that I wasn't thinking straight.  Buyers beware....if you like to journal in just short words, then you'll really enjoy it.  For those who need more space and more lines to write, this journal will not work!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Out of the box?  What box!?  Love the information, the speakers are well chosen and very well informed... great app!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is an awesome app. I can't imagine being without it now. I even take my Bible Study notes in it!
B003ES61EE|2.0|I have one of these by Nikon and one by Amazon, I had to use the Nikon one to clean a lens the Amazon could not get clean.  The cleaning pad is half the size of the Nikon.<br />  Less cost for the Amazon, but it is not worth the difference, in my opinion.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Final victory over Valdemort was inevitable, although in doubt at times.  A look into the future in the final chapter was a little brief.<br />I was hoping it was teaser for future books.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Great product for it`s money. Sturdy. I've paid much more for for much less. If you have a kindle HD 7,  I highly recommend this one.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|First of all, ignore all the negative reviews. They are from people that most likely never read the book, or are caught up in the certain right wing media islamaphobic movement. This is not a book that criticizes Christianity, or debases Jesus. It is a HISTORY book about the life of a person named Jesus.  Jesus who lived in Nazareth. A man even when not considering the portrayal in the bible is someone to be admired and followed. The book is well researched and documented in regards to sources. It is well written and easy to read. Read it if you want to be informed. Ignore it if you have an agenda.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This is a really great app, I absolutely adore it!  There are so many reasons I love it, it takes really nice video and music can still run.  I have a kindle fire hd and it works fine sometimes you have to check to make sure it works on this too but it works no problem and I just love this!! This a defiantly a must have app!
B00846REIS|5.0|I love romance novels and heard this is a lot like 50 shades but not as good.  I thought it was actually really different and a lot better.  NOt as nasty and had a hint of 50 shades in some places, but overall I thought a better story!!!  Book 2 I thought was also really good, but would have preferred to read it not audibly listen to it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My cousin loves this game he's only 3 he always runs down my battery playing this game best game and I like the world tour stuff very cool!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great game but would be even better with out all the other game ads. too many interruptions for other free games.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The whole series is just incredible. The detailed descriptions of the battles as well as the everyday life of folks make you  fell like you are living that which are reading. The multitude of characters and story lines keep you so involved and interested that you cant wait to see what will happen next and don't even try to predict what that will be!
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, definitely worth a watch. This package includes two discs, a DVD and a Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The included \\"digital copy\\" is actually just a code to go download the movie from Shout Factory's website. You are made to choose between \\"Windows Media Player\\" and \\"Android/iOS\\" for the format that you want to receive, and then only either 480p or 720p resolutions. I chose the higher res WMV, and was sorely disappointed. The file is encrypted with some kind of DRM which means it will only play in Windows Media Player (not VLC, forget about it on Linux). I saw noticeable intermittent quality issues during playback which were obvious defects in the file. You would be much better off making your own 1080p rip of the Blu-Ray if you want a digital copy.<br /><br />Good value, enjoyable movie (if a bit short). It would have been five stars if the digital copy weren't awful.
0736092269|5.0|Nice review of muscles and how they work, I had this is nursing school 30 years ago but had forgotten so much
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Fun Game, But It's Slow To Progress. I'd Like It Better If The Reef Could Grow A Little Quicker. Right?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a totally awesome game! But like most of the reviewers said, it sucks to have spend despic coins on all the real cool stuff, but u can't earn them through out the game. But I guess if they don't get money we don't get great games like these. So I guess it's no win, but in a good way and at least the game itself is free :-)
0064471837|5.0|This is one of my all time favourite fantasy series! After learning about the sequels that Mr. Nix is writing... I had to let everyone here know about how brilliant this series is!<br /><br />The main character is strong, and her personality so vivid! The story is compelling! A complete page-turner! I have read this series at least 6 times and it never loses its appeal.<br /><br />The world the Nix creates is the perfect parallel between the fantasy of the \\"Old Kingdom\\" and the reality of Ancelstierre (that seems to parallel early 20th century England).<br />You're immersed in a world of fantasy, yet still grounded by the \\"modernity\\" of the southern Ancelstierre.<br /><br />Magic, Myth, History, Struggle, Love.... this series really does have it all!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Okay so I got this app because my kindle fire wasn't playing YouTube videos at all. But now after about a week and a half it won't even open. Every time I try it just says &quot;vtube has stopped&quot;. So other than that it used to work great. But I need it fixed because I'm 13 and live on there.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game although I have played some other G5 games I liked better. I wish that it had combined more of the other type of puzzles instead of so many find the object games. Still.much fun was had.
B009PDO946|5.0|I am a self confessed Viennese music \\"junkie.\\"  I have CDs and vinyl of all sorts of music from many Viennese composers.  I have most of the New Year's Concerts that are available on DVD going back to Willi Boskovsky (the master).  This year's concert, in my opinion, was a good as any of the other ones.  Many of the pieces were not the usual that this group has played in past concerts.  This I found refreshing.  The Blu ray images were good.  The DTS-HD master sound track was clean and lively.  There were a number of interesting extras including the complete Ballet numbers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this version of solitaire. It is quick to come up and I love the movements of the cards. This game is good to go.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|After many attempts to purchase the song, &#34;The Dance&#34; and not finding it online, found this DVD at Amazon.  It is absolutely THE BEST.  Contains a compilation of his songs and the videos.  I watched the entire collection of videos--even ones for songs that weren't familiar to me.  They're all good!  The price was perfect too.
0064471837|5.0|This book has been one of my favorites since I was a child (not to mention the sequels!) and I would recommend it to just about anyone. It is the best of what I would class as dark fantasy - using some \\"horror\\" elements to tell a story, rather than focusing on scaring you.<br /><br />The worldbuilding along makes the book worth reading. The lands of life and death are both created expertly, and the system of magic is especially worthy of note. The contrast between bound and free magic is something that I at least haven't seen in many other places, and it's execution in Sabriel really stands out! You get a feel for just how grand and occasionally frightening the magic can be. It's hard to describe it better than the author does, so give it a look!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|quick moving. fun to play. different from bejewel as the levels go by quickly. still getting the hang of it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is awesome it's fun creative and addicting there is no other game like it! I always enjoy playing this game anyone would
B005COO1X6|4.0|Mile 81 was like the way Stephen King used to write, which I admire very much. I like the way he brings all the pieces of the puzzle together at the end. I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes he gets to &#34;wordy&#34;.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Had a lot of fun with this game from the very first time I opened it. I liked the large variety of games within the larger mission. Kept me coming back to see what was next!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzle graphics are best have ever seen.  Can't wait for next version but wish it was longer.  Keep will coming.<br /><br />Ben
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is a great app, other Youtube apps say that this video is not made for smaller devices. I have a Kindle Fire and it works amazingly!! Any video, you name it, Its here and you can watch it. Download now!
0316776963|4.0|DAVID SEDARIS either you like it or love it or hate it. He's a cool writer and he's had an interesting life so its fun to read.
B000031WYP|5.0|I've been familiar with the Intermezzo for many years and have loved it, but when I finally decided to try the entire opera, I found that I love it. Other reviewers provide more technical info, but I find this a very satisfying recording of the opera. Along with the Symphonic Intermezzio, I'm particularly fond of Inneggiamo, Allegro giacoso, and Regina coeli laetare. Anyone who loves the melodies of Puccini should enjoy this opera. I do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game there should be number 2.its like a more colerful version of temple run.I think this game is for when you're bored or looking to break a record.I love this game.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I watch over and over again. Love the main characters that made up the band of merry men. I love most of Russell Crowe's movies. I have a secret crush on Kevin Durand, (Little John). Max Von Sydow ..can't believe he's still alive, but love his work too.<br />The dvd came in the mail within like 2 days of ordering it on amazon.com, from this seller. The dvd was in immaculate condition. I saw no scratches, nor any wear and tear. Didn't pay much attention to the case, not important to me. It serves it's purpose.<br />Completely satisfied!
B008XG1X18|1.0|All of a sudden I have three columns of pins. They're too small,  you have open it to &quot;like&quot; or &quot;repin&quot;, and it's booting me off way more often. Change it Back - PLEASE!! Any ideas for similar sites to occupy my time. Pinterest is too frustrating now.  :-(
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The production standards continue to be high, the performers are believable, and the inevitable license taken with the source material is not too jarring. With the possible exception of Qarth. If you've read the books you know what I mean. If you haven't read the books, you really should.
B002OHB3CG|5.0|That's just great. Vocals, instruments, all... And live... Great voices. Totally recommended. Good job. Keep it going. Con gra tu la tions.
B00ATUEKY8|4.0|This book was so intense and real. I loved it. Felt like I was there feeling her pain throughout the entire book.
B003ITDN86|5.0|And that's sum41. Just good. Listing since 2001. Waiting for the new record... I hope have it soon. Congrats, sum41.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|i have an extremely small room, thought this would work as least half descent. it does when i play, but when any children try to play it doesn't notic there motions all the time. kinda sucks cause i bought it to help my nephew to use the kinect.
0064471837|5.0|After having grown up with the likes of Sabriel and Lirael, I cannot help but feel glad to be able to write this review. I'm going to try to be as comprehensive and concise as possible, alas forgive me for rambling on. I'm looking at my bookcase now, and specifically at the Garth Nix \\"section\\" reliving happy memories from the Abhorsen series. The story itself is one of childlike wonder, the story of a young girl who seeks to save her father (and the kingdom) by using the skills she has been trained to use. It includes a variety of moral decisions that whilst building the character also seeks to include, and build a rapport with, the reader. And believe me, it works. The intricacies of the magic itself suggest an immense amount of creativity on account of the writer, but also allowing the reader to be fully included and allows them to fully understand how it works. The intricacies in the plot seek to give the reader an advantage in knowing the story and yet keep things suspenseful right up until the very end. An excellent book and a superb series.
030758836X|5.0|\\"Friends see most of each other's flaws. Spouses see every awful last bit.\\"<br /><br />This is an odd book to review because I don't want to give anything away and spoil the surprises, of which there are many, for anyone.  I don't read many mysteries, this isn't because I don't like them, I love them when they are good but I'm also impatient with them.  I want to know how it is going to work out right now and like a kid before Christmas it is so hard for me to wait to unwrap the presents.  This one was torturous to not unwrap and peak to see what would happen and how things would work out in the end.  I literally had to slap my hand and say \\"NO\\" do not peak.<br /><br />This is not a book for people who like two dimensional characters where one is almost perfect and you can clearly root for that character to win, to save the day or get their just desserts.  No this is a complicated character book where people are good and bad and really good and extraordinarily bad along with wickedly smart.  This is a book that shifted what I wanted to happen in the end more than once.  Normally I can pick out who I want to get whatever the prize in the bottom of the cereal box is and I can stick with that.  However, I changed my mind numerous times and felt torn about so many of the issues in the story.  I can see why people love this book or hate this book and there really isn't a lot of in-between.  I don't need to love the characters to love a book, sure it helps, but I don't' need to if the story is there.  I liked this book so much because the story was there.  But if you have to love the characters to love the book this might not be for you.  Don't get me wrong they were likeable, understandable but definitely and totally full of flaws.  I was kept on the edge of my seat with what could possibly happen next.<br /><br />Here is as much as I think I can say without ruining it for anyone.  Nick and Amy met fell in love and got married.  They were the best versions of themselves for a while they lead a charming life together.  But life happened, time went on and five years later they are not the same people anymore.  Nick hasn't really been a great husband for some time and Amy vanishes on their 5 year anniversary under unusual circumstances.  In the aftermath the story unfolds to reveal Amy and Nick's life together and what might have happened to Amy.  Yep, that is about all I can say.<br /><br />Gone Girl is a rollercoaster ride, with small details dished out here and there.  This is smart and wickedly intriguing.  I don't think there is anyone who can say completely oh yeah I saw that coming.  Because even what I thought I saw coming didn't end up being anything close to what the truth of it was.for a while they lead a charming life together.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|This started out to be one of the best books I've read in ages. It is informative, while being a fascinating story. Unfortunately, it is very sad, but we do need to know that tragedies like this are happening in the world.  The writing is clear, sensitive, and engaging. I was disappointed with the last 25% of the book, when it just seemed to fizzle out.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Would recommend to any age level. I would like to see the regen level increase faster but it's free so definitely worth it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I liked everything about this book. I'd recommend this to fans of the the Walking Dead. That series just seems to fall flat.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Thank you brother for keep making the kick ass good ones. Sci fi forever!  This movie is great. special effects really good. plot is solid and first rate. the special effects make this movie, along with Tom and Olga, and the whole cast. As a sci fi fan, and action fan, it is up to par. the director did a fabulous job here. the surface of the earth is what blew my mind most. very well done.
B00COCY67A|5.0|You call yourself &#34;The Know It All&#34;.......you don't know squat! This is a very good album from start to finish.
B001223BLU|5.0|Lots of great hits for very low cost. It was a good buy indeed. Many good memories in this album.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|i absolutely love this show. The storyline was great, some episodes were a little dry. The season overrall was great but definitely nothing compared to season 1.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|my only real problem with this app is that it occasionally will stutter and sometimes crashes my kindle. when it works it is a fantastic game and lots of fun. it does work a lot more than it doesn't.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Very in sightful and subjective. The narration is very good and some of the scenarios outlined challenge the mind to read more into the daily activities an  patterns that one develops. Good book to understand and develop a perspective  of one's habits. It's definitely not a guide  or an instruction manual on how to change or develop habits. It's more of an observational effort that provides enough nuggets to start thinking and analyze  one self.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like the different modes and challenges.  I like the blades you earn and the music and noise of the bladed fruit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this game along side of my 5 yr. old. He can't do all the clues himself yet but loves to play.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|The reading levels should be posted for the book.  It is a challenge for a second grader with the help of mom and sister we enjoyed reading this good story.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|There have been a lot of positive things said about this set.  Crazy amount of extras, and though I have not seen all of the movies yet, what I have viewed looks good.  The book is adorable, which houses all of the Blu-rays.  My only complaint with the book, is the placement of the movies.  Unfortunately, I had to return my first copy, because of scratches.  After inspecting my replacement, I decided to leave the extras within the book.  I removed the movies and placed them in separate cases.  Didn't want to do this because of space issues, but had to limit the chance of scratches.<br /><br />It's going to take a little while to watch everything, with all the extras.  So far I am enjoying looking at the movies with vibrant colors, alternate endings, and scarier viewing.  Glad I bought it when it was $19.99.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was amazing. Very detailed. Well written. I cannot wait for the movie to come out in the theaters
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Really fun game!! I could play for hours and hours!! I recommend this game to everyone!! But I think we should be able to play as many games we want too!!
1932100660|5.0|We are currently transitioning to a full plant-based diet, and can't read enough on the subject.  Dr. Campbell and his work is very well-respected and life-transforming.
0785153942|4.0|Loved it, but it's short.  It gives you an insight into the story as a prequel but you can read the entire thing in ten minutes.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I remember the old time song this title references.  I listened to several songs on this CD and had to buy the whole album.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|this is a very challenging game. I was able to figure out the basics and eventually work my way through some levels using basic tactics. overall its very entertaining!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Never heard of Hugh Laurie until HOUSE premiered and became a regular viewing pleasure.  Then I read how he loved jazz and played.  I looked it up and listened and OMG...  he is really GOOD.  Bought this CD for my husband.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|It's a good app for a few days, but it crashes all the time now on my Kindle Fire... not sure what's happening/if this happens to other people. without the little kink it's quite fun and all of my friends love it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A novel that makes you sad it has to end. Heart- wrenching, agonizing and upsetting in places because you become so caught up in the characters that you feel what they feel.<br />I enjoyed Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns and now definitely And the Mountains Echoed.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It constantly crashes! I don't know why! I tried refreshing my Kindle Fire, delete and then upload again, but nothing seems to be working. ): I was definitely looking forward to playing!
B008602KQI|5.0|Big brother and corporate greed combine to control rogue &#34;districts&#34;.  Loved it...can't wait for the sequel.  WIsh there was more backstory to how states became districts.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I LOVE this app! ♥ it lets me stay organized and I am able to take it anywhere with my Kindle Fire! a must have for all of us students, parents, or just busybodies in general.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this mainly out of curiosity since it was getting so much attention. I couldn't put it down and finished the series in a week. Love it! I have to admit though, with all of the fuss everyone was making I thought it was going to be much more sexually explicit than it really is so don't let all the hype scare you away from reading this book.
0307245306|5.0|Percy Jackson is having trouble in the sixth grade. He seems to be failing all of his classes (again) and has been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. On top of that, he is always a target for bullies, which to make life even more embarrassing, are often girls. But strange things have been happening recently that Percy can't explain, and when he tries to talk to his only friend, Grover, about them, Grover acts like nothing is out of the ordinary. Percy's home life is not great, either, since his step-dad is a selfish loafer who doesn't like Percy. His mom says his real dad went away on an ocean voyage many years ago and hasn't come back, but Percy thinks she's hiding something. When monsters from Greek mythology attack, he knows something is definitely wrong. But those are just stories...right?<br /><br />One of my friends kept telling me I needed to read this series, so I finally picked it up and listened to the book on CD. I loved it. It started out a little slowly for me, and I wasn't always sure where the story was going since it jumped around to different scenes so much, but no matter what, I wanted to know what would happen to Percy and his friends. Even though I'm not up on Greek mythology, that wasn't a problem. In fact you learn about it as you travel with Percy to meet the various gods and monsters. I enjoyed watching Percy overcome each trial put in his path and see him come to trust his instincts and his friends, despite being warned otherwise. The book broaches some dark subjects that may be scary for younger readers, so I recommend this book for ages ten and up. Anyone who enjoys a good adventure or quest story would probably like this first in a series. I already have the second one ready to listen to. A note on the audio version: very entertaining and great for car rides. The actor who does the reading changes voices well.
0345803507|5.0|Definitely did not expect this trilogy to end the way it did. Love the way the author develops all of the characters and thought it turned out perfectly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game! I can never get enough of it! I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a fast paced game
