B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked the story as there was good developement of the main character, by the end of the story you understood who he was and why.  The author gave an idea of the time line on his life and his reactions with out being too graphic. However, it is still a not an easy read emotionally, but worth the time.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The editing really made the movie hard to follow. Felt like different cuts were stitched together. Not cohesive, disjointed, poor ending.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Engaging and really tough to put down. There are many other reviews that tell you what you need to know about this series, I can just say it's amazing.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Big fan of Evernote. It's my business goto, safe for ideas, and collector of things that intrigue me on the internet. Check it out. It's great.
B009LREA1S|5.0|I would consider moving to an island and watching this movie on repeat for the rest of my life. SHES rip
B008R14YBK|2.0|THE GOOD: Bridget is a very talented singer! shes has  a lovely wholesome personality! she is cute!\\"ready or not\\" is a great pop song!!!<br /><br />THE BAD: for the most part, all the songs are very bland....she doesn't have a very energetic,spunky or wild personality/image to sell such uninteresting music...and her \\"rapping\\" is very awkward...<br /><br />OVERALL: This album is really only good for background music at cafes,bookstores or laid back teen movies. \\"Ready or not\\" is still a killer song though, and the only one really worth listening to on album. Its even a MUCH better song than the mega hit \\"we are never ever getting back together\\" by country pop star taylor swift. its a shame it didnt get as much success though...but then again, taylor's overall album is much better than bridgits debut...

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read a few books on my Kindle that the authors should be ashamed to have published in any form. Awful spelling and grammar, poor story structure, and cardboard characters abound. So when the buzz around Wool reached my ears, I figured it must be the same. Every \\"author\\" has their group of family and friends promoting their self-published works and extolling their virtues. I heard so much about Wool, however, that I broke down and purchased it on a whim. I figured if it was horrible I would just erase it and move on.<br /><br />I was so glad to be pleasantly surprised by this book.<br /><br />No, that's not strong enough language. This book is in a class with other sci-fi classics written by the greats. Asimov, Dick, Card; I would be comfortable lumping this book in with their works. It's that good. I could not put this book down once I started. I am going to purchase the hard cover edition just to place it on my shelf with my other most loved books.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this collection. If you like sci-fi at all, you will enjoy Wool.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|I remembered watching this movie as a little kid and thought how fun to see how my kids react to it. They loved it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book is amazing. Teens and patterns should have to read so they have an understanding of signs of depression etc.
B0026PA05M|4.0|This band rocks. I got The Strange Case Of... first, liked it so much that I purchased Halestorm (first album). I think the second is better, but this is more of a 4 1/2 than a 4. Needs to be played on a real amp with real speakers really loud.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|If you own previous editions, get this--sound is best yet. Though interestingly enough, some little nuance (bow on strings in Act I prelude Walkure edited out now)--but really, the best sound, worth it, and additional stuff is fun. I learned the Ring inside out years ago from the unsurpassed Cooke explanatory CDs included.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I have not loved a band this much and been able to just put the record, album, or whatever we are calling it right now in a very long time.<br />I am a fan for life. All the men in my life are telling me I am overplaying this album but I do not care. I am in love with them.<br />I play music while I am working on the computer and get lost in social media and when this Album pops into my headphones I find myself on the bands twitter page. Then I am tweeting what I am listening to, which I never do. I work in Books. Buy it! It was love at first listen for me!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|An action flick for the ADD. There is no real story here, just a bunch of explosions. Although it is nice to see our old favorite action heroes, plastic surgery, or in some cases a rough life (evidently), have made some of them look inhuman. The creepiest are Dolph (who does indeed look like Frankenstein's Monster), JCVD (whose eyes, post surgery, resemble either the Creature from the Black Lagoon or Fu Man Chu), and Stallone (who's eerie white plastic face hovers above a non-matching body). At one point I had to look away because they were stroking each other so much with their homage's and punchlines, I thought they were going to blow each other (not up).<br />Stallone's muscles look so tensed/tight that he appears ready to explode, like in the ending of some weird sci-fi movie. There is a particular cut, in the opening slaughter fest, where Stallone and Stratham go from riding in a jeep on the ground to suddenly piloting a plane...? I am sure this movie, which appears to have been written as it was being filmed (there is no real story) will appease many fans of mindless violence, but reaches a level of violence that is almost a parody.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book within a few days during a vacation.  I couldn't put it down.  Interesting story line.  I would definitely recommend this book
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland Season 1 was fast moving, with an interesting plot and characters, with a lot of suspense. Can't wait for the next season.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book really puts you in it's scenario making you feel for both sides of the story. Honestly, I couldn't put it down. It was so interesting and I wanted to know more and more about how the plot line was going to turn. I totally recommend this book to anyone wanting a good read.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book just makes you smile.  Its simple, and a very easy read.  I wasn't disappointed and I finished the book in a day.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book but I wish I knew this author before this book.  I loved the way he wrote, and most likely will read more of his books.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book puts you right on Mars. It's an incredibly imaginative and innovative work of fiction. At least I think it's a work of fiction -- it was so realistic you almost have to wonder... And I'll say this about Andy Weir -- if I'm ever stuck on a deserted island, or an EMP device goes off wiping out our electricity, that's the guy I'd want next to me.

B009SQRL4U|4.0|I don't see this becoming a super popular movie, but it's cute. It's worth renting. My 7 and 3 year olds were interested off and on throughout the movie, but it captured the attentions of my husband and I through the whole thing.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I am normally not into this type of entertainment, but the characters, plots and special effects are outstanding.  The writers are doing a fantastic job keeping the fans on the edge and wanting more.  I can't wait until the next episodes air in a few months.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|i loved this movie. as a diehard Dark Shadows fan I was thrilled to be able to see this update of a classic. I never could find Jonathan Frid in the movie. Maybe he was in the crowd scene. I loved the modern twists and turns and the soulful way tribute was paid to the classic Barnabus Collins character. Job well done.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I make a lot of lists and make notes about everything.  Its handy and clean and a great product.  Try it
B009E3EY38|3.0|I have most of the original Led Zep vinyl albums, bought when they came out and always played on high quality audio equipment and handled with TLC.  What incredible music this was back in the day! I was looking forward to this CD/DVD set with much anticipation -- celebrating the contribution and life of Ahmet Ertegun, founder and head of Atlantic Records, Zeppelin's label.  (For reference: I don't have a $100k or even a $50k sound / home theater system, but it is definitely not your run-of-the-mill Big Box store all-in-one \\"hi-fi\\".  Purchased new, my components would total in the neighborhood of $20k.  And I have enjoyed being an audiophile for 40+ years.)<br /><br />I first viewed the DVD of the dress rehearsal performance.  My first impression was:  Where is JPJones' bass?  There was little if no definition to the bass line -- and the level seemed well below where it should have been -- all sounding as if it were \\"one-note\\" although you can see him moving his hands and fingers up and down the neck and plucking the 4 strings.  But there was little musicality to the sound.  This was not how his performance should have been portrayed.  One wonders did he even approve of the mix?<br /><br />As for the rest of the band, John Bonham's son Jason does a fine sit-in, with lots of power and \\"rock\\".  However, there also seemed to be a certain something lacking.  Jimmy Page certainly wails on the guitar, but at times it was way over done, as if the level was maxed out resulting in constant harshness (clipping distortion ?).  The best part of the mix is Robert Plant's singing.<br /><br />I thought:  Well maybe the Blue-ray concert cut will be better.  Nope.  Only more of the same, oft times worse.<br /><br />As for the audio-only CDs:  Well, in general, they only exacerbate the disappointing quality of this concert recording.<br /><br />I guess the audio mixer and mixing engineer (Alan Moulder and John Catlin, respectively) wanted to show-case Plant and Page, while committingJones' bass and the drum kit of Bonham to being second fiddles, as it were.  (BTW:  Jones' keyboards stand on equal footing, sound and performance-wise, to the other 2 original members.  So again, what happened to the bass?)<br /><br />I thought of giving it 2 stars, but given today's digital recording and transfer technology (although this is not strictly a \\"hi res\\" SACD transfer), this is a poor excuse for \\"celebrating\\" what this band was always known for -- hard hitting, rock solid, but none-the-less musical performances.  Guess I'll just have to keep enjoying the old vinyl -- made as the band members themselves originally intended.  Oh where is the spirit of Ahmet Ertegun when he is needed?<br /><br />*** EDITED as of 3/13/13 ***<br />Ok. OK. After getting somewhat slammed by a couple of you, I have decided to revise my rating to 3 stars.  Although my origianl comments stand, it's because I like the music so darn much that I am relenting.  And that's what it's all about anyway -- THE MUSIC!  Long live Zep's music.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I cannot believe.....this disc is better than the first one!  I am playing it over & over.  Not a good idea to have it on when the kiddos are in the car though!  It's a banquet of treat after treat and it keeps Bruno's sexy voice in my head all day long!
1407130293|5.0|Well the books are amazing. And this set was great because I got all three books for a great price.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|The acting and story-lines are 1st rate.  Though the graphic nature of sex and violence may be over the top for some, overall a great show to watch.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I hope the author would write the third one soon :) Fantastic series. Very well paced. Slow building but inescapable characters and a story that stands alone.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|It was good but the character motivations, particularly why they had to shut down the program &#34;Outcome&#34;, seemed a little far fetched and outrageous.  Otherwise, the action sequences and the tie in to the other movies was great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover wrote about an extremely difficult subject but treated it with immense respect and delicacy that equaled a meaningful experience for the reader whether this thing has touched their life or not. I felt everything Sky felt and everything Holder felt. He was the most amazing character ever. The sex scenes were perfectly balanced and were also written with an eloquent amount of class and respect which provided the reader with a deeper respect for the characters intimate connection.<br /><br />The two most poignant lessons for me from the book were these two quotes:<br /><br />\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\\"<br /><br />\\"While I could sit here and feel sorry for myself, wondering why all of this happened to me...I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to wish for a perfect life. The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down. I'm choosing to stand up taller. I'll probably get knocked down a few more times before this life is through with me, but I can guarantee you I'll never stay on the ground.\\"<br /><br />I never thought I could love a book as equally as I do Slammed but now I think I do. I \\"LIVE\\" HOPELESS!<br /><br />BRAVO Colleen you did it again!
1609613937|5.0|I am part of a vegan household and so the guidelines in the McDougall diet fit well with our ethics. We got this after watching Forks Over Knives. I've found it informative and enjoyable.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie ties all the previous super hero movies (Ironman !-2, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk) together perfectly!  We see a familiar villain in Loki.  All the characteristics of these hero's from their previous flicks remain intact (especially Tony Starks sharp wit!)  Absolutely brilliant!
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Beautiful film I enjoyed it, Johnny Depp did a wonderful job so did Judy Dench and the main character of the film Juliette Binoche. I love my self some chocolate in real life Godiva mmmmmm my favorite. But this film is about bringing people together with chocolate and love. But in the beginning the towns people where dispiteful of the brown treats.
B0037WP83M|5.0|Ties Fellowship and Return of the King together perfectly!  Peter Jackson nailed it on this trilogy!  Definitely a must see.

B008SLAXGO|5.0|I love this book! I recommend everyone to buy this book here! And it's really big, the pictures look awesome!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I have purchased five of these same sweepers and I loved them, but the one I purchased on Amazon is almost worthless.  I am thinking they are now cutting costs and making them in a cheaper way.  The power is very low, maybe they changed the wattage.  Does not work well at all.  So disappointed because I loved these sweepers prior to buying this one.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|This unforgettable 1961 romantic comedy,\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" was taken and translated to the big screen from Truman Capote's classic novella. Directing this timeless classic is Blake Edwards, who is also the director of some other memorable pieces such as, The Great Race, in 1965 along with The Pink Panther, in 1963.<br />  With  \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", being a much more heartfelt story, Edwards impressively still managed to keep it upbeat while still making sure to balance it out with the proper sentiment. Taking the lead role of Holly Golightly, is the beautiful Audrey Hepburn, while her new neighbor and future love interest, Paul Varjak, is played by the handsome George Peppard. Holly's light hearted and entertaining character brings her and Paul, or \\"Fred\\" as she likes to call him, closer together rather rapidly, while keeping  the audience engaged. Holly lives all alone in a rather empty apartment with a \\"poor nameless slob\\" cat, surviving off of the fifty dollars her alternating wealthy dates give her for the powder room. Unlike Capote's novella, Edwards makes sure to keep Holly's lifestyle and choice of career much more vague and casual in the film. Rather than making it flamboyant that she's a prostitute, rather he has the film more centered on Holly's desire to be wealthy and marry a man solely based on his financial status.<br />Fred, along with the audience, falls head over heels for Holly knowing that she's a \\"wild thing\\" and doesn't want to be loved or \\"owned\\" by anyone. \\"To know her is to love her\\" is the proper phrase to use when it comes to describe Holly, one can't help but to love her great charisma and innocence. Although she feels money will buy her her happiness, she doesn't know how to act once reality hits her and she finds her true happiness in being with Fred.<br />  Holly Golightly's character is simply delightful and it's quite hard to resist her innocent charm. As Fred starts to fall for the \\"untamable\\" Holly, so does the viewer. Inmy opinion this movie is truly a five star classic, the acting is phenomenal and the characters are relatable and engaging, while Edwards remains to keep Capote's storyline classy.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A fun game and a good way to learn to use my Kindle Fire.  It does not matter your age to enjoy this game.
B002GSXKN8|3.0|I myself am not a fan of these movies, Batman and Batman Returns are the only remotely bearable ones for me and even that is a stretch.<br /><br />My little boy on the other hand, well hes in love!!<br /><br /> The plots are terrible, the dialogue is awful, and I am not sure who was a worse Batman... Val Kilmer or George Clooney. But this really is a good value for four movies, and if my son likes and enjoys them, I guess I can tolerate them.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game to use coordination and problem solving.  And it is fun to play on my Kindle Fire.  I liked it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love all Gillian Flynn's books.  This one was hard to put down.  Hidden intense mental illness on many levels.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|This book brought back memories of reading and seeing movie many years ago.  Enjoyed reading it on my Kindle Fire.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I rented this because I was not sure I would even like it. The second movie in the series was a rel let down for me and failed to be as good as the first in my opinion. So I decided to blow an Amazon provided credit to watch this. My wife was also not too keen on seeing this after the second movie.<br /><br />We were both amazed and surprised by how good this movie is, I have to stop right here I like this movie so much If I keep writing I am going to ruin it for someone. If you liked the first movie and the second left you thinking yeah riding off the first one then the Third movie this one redeems the whole series but only if you see the first two.<br /><br />I will be buying this when the price drops someday.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Very interesting, well written, great sequel. Excited to read the third book! It's a great series so far and I'd highly recommend
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a good starter for those who want to learn how to play the game.<br />Enjoyable! Would be nice if you could do more though.

1451638450|5.0|Especially in the middle section, this book becomes the \\"housekeeping\\" novel of the Vorkosigan saga. We relearn history, see just about the entire cast of characters and how they relate to each other, and explore Barrayar and the general universe-building of this series from all directions. What happened to so-and-so? What about whatshisface? It's all here. The plus side is immersing oneself in trivia and renewing old friendships; the not-so-plus side is a barrage of characters (and character names) as well as planets, wormholes and political systems, and not quite being able to recall who/what the heck they all are!<br /><br />End result: I must reread the entire Miles saga! (Oh boy!)<br /><br />It took me a while to catch on that this takes place BEFORE \\"Cryoburn.\\" Miles (who shows up only for a few pages) has just the two kids at this time. Of course one of the joys of this book is to focus on That Idiot Ivan (who turns out not to be that much of an idiot after all). Another is to wallow in the fabulous crafting of language that LMB dishes out. When the plot bogs down a bit in the middle, the prose is still astonishing. (Reminder to self: I must purchase an \\"enlarge your vocabulary\\" book.) And of course we have LMB's glorious humor. There is one particular dramatic setup here that every reader can see coming--it's hilariously obvious, though ominous--and it's capped off with a completely unexpected punchline that had me laughing uncontrollably for a full two minutes. (So glad I wasn't reading in public!)<br /><br />In addition to learning more about Ivan from all angles, we also are treated to lengthy scenes with Simon Illyan, post-stroke (he suffered that in \\"Memory,\\" I think). If you're a fan of all things Vor, this book MUST be on your reading list!
0375842209|5.0|There are such great words here -- such a great story told simply. This is historical fiction at its finest and finds absolutely beautiful moments in one of our history's ugliest times.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend it.
B004VB3V0K|5.0|I've previously been blocked by understanding I/O, and monads in other treatises on Haskell. Try reading about monads on Wikipedia to get my drift. Maybe I didn't try hard enough. Now I finally get it, after stepping through examples and down-to-earth analogies presented by this book! Even the book title makes sense now.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not a fiction book but gives background on effort and determination of individuals who wish to become a SEAL. Does detail the mission to 'get' Osama Bin Laden.
1611134226|2.0|Like many other reviewers, I have been a fan of the character Pendergast from the beginning in &#34;Relic.&#34;  The series has been in decline for quite some time and &#34;Two Graves&#34; does nothing to re-establish faith in the authors.  There are so many problems with this book. The writing is both repetitive and random. The authors seem to glom on to one word - like &#34;stasis,&#34; and use it over and over in one event sequence and then move on to grind another pet term to death. So many of the events in this book have already been used, ad nauseum, in this series - dark races through underground tunnels, infiltrating a secret island lab, preternatural juveniles, hidden &#34;deficient&#34; humans.  The authors, for no useful reason, place completely incongruous features in real geographic locations making it impossible for a reader to suspend disbelief. The characters have no consistent set of traits. For example, Pendergast is at times super-human and at times laughably stupid (such as failing to notice in his wife the after-effects of a significant physical event).  And who leaves massive amounts of weapons completely unguarded?  The authors just throw every tired trope of suspense novels into the ultimately unappetizing soup that is supposed to be a plot: German nazis hiding in Brazil, a volcano, a serial killer, a South American militia, alternate futures, car salesmen (not making this up), water snakes, a completely random crazy old lady unaware that her former grandeur has not just faded - but started to rot, bodies buried in a basement.  I think the authors spent too much time in a Jasper Fford novel randomly buying narrative devices hoping that if they put enough lipstick on, no one would notice its still a pig.  The authors also fall into the lazy option of having one of the most mysterious characters merely recount her history rather than actually weave the pre-story into the active narrative itself. Appallingly, the authors have taken several different stories and just crammed them all into this book with no attempt at connection. What makes this offensive is that in pursuing completely separate plot lines for previously interconnected characters, the authors cause their characters to overtly betray the trust and reliance previously established between the characters. At the same time that the authors have the characters abandon important friends and colleagues, these same characters suddenly put their whole lives in the hands of completely new and unknown actors.  Who knew that a monster created when a scientist consumed the wrong plant would be more realistically developed than any of the people in &#34;Two Graves.&#34;  The authors obviously don't give a crap about their readers or about the craft.  I wish the original Agent Pendergast was around to vanquish the demon that stole the authors' creativity and integrity and restore the series to the clever fun that was briefly glimpsed yet all to quickly bled out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really like this app. Absolutely no problems with the install. Immediately downloaded a free book and started playing with the controls. Works great so far.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|If you liked &#34;Devil in the White City&#34; I think you will like &#34;Midnight in Peking&#34;. The two books share the same device of using a horrific crime(s) as a hook to immerse the reader in a different time (and place).  There are definitely people who appear briefly in this book that I hope to find out more about through other resources.  A couple times the narrative was jarring when an individual was suddenly disclosed as very different from an earlier description, but maybe that is just how life unfolds sometimes. Nevertheless, some individuals' actions seemed incongruent with the earlier narrative.  One other odd disconnect is that the author was better at portraying the atrocities committed against the single murder victim than those committed against the population at large during the numerous conflicts referenced in the story.  I particularly enjoyed the glimpse into some unique aspects of daily life, such as descriptions of foods and entertainment options. Ultimately, the book kept me entertained and also taught me some things.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I've loved Michael Bubl&eacute;'s style for a while now, but this Christmas album is amazing!  It is apporpriately traditional and also new timely favorites.  I HIGHLY recommend!!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book was a perfect \\"get away from the madness of the season\\" book.....entertaining and caused me to laugh out loud!  Would make a good gift for friends, male and female.
B009VB97EY|1.0|no plot,<br />movie really drags on<br />what were they thinking?<br />was hoping for something like the Full Monty.<br />I was very disapointed and regret spending the money.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very &#34;hot&#34;  and steamy with a good story.  Can't wait to see what happens.  Right now, in the middle of book 2.  My husband actually read the books before me and he thought they were great! He kept bugging me to read them!<br /><br />I enjoy the first person narrative.  It is so interesting reading the main character's point of view on everything.  The book is both dark and serious at times, but not without some comic relief and amusing situations.<br /><br />I really enjoy reading the book anytime I want on my Droid Razr.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Who could not love this book?  Philosophy, fantasy and zoology all collide into one great storytelling.  Great book for discussion.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|If I were in the business of making movies, I would probably keep the wolf vs. airplane duos on the cutting room floor. In the opening scene of this movie Renner's character had just scaled a precipitous mountain range on foot, in a blizzard, while being chased by wild animals. Did I then need to see him laboriously stuff a tracking device down a rabid wolf's throat in order to evade a drone bomber to fully grasp his badassness?<br /><br />The Ludlum series (first three Bourne books/movies) were highly character based - plenty of internal contemplation and strife to set the pace of drama. Action in his books was relatively minimal and never gimmicky, and the first three Bourne movies captured this character-driven battle well.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner was great, as he tends to be, but several silly stunts were not only implausible, but unnecessary for telling a story about a government conspiracy gone wrong. Inserting a nail into a fire extinguisher hose to craft a mid-battle MacGyver gun? His bare hands are lethal weapons!<br /><br />Not a bad movie, but that's about the nicest thing I can say.
B004GJ1XU2|4.0|I was feeling a little sentimental and ran across this film.  I was just what I needed to remind myself - &#34;you can't always get what you want&#34;.  Still funny, and though not quite as touching as when I saw it 30  years ago, a reminder of a very different time.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This was a wonderful and funny movie for the whole family - kids from ages 4.5 to 9 thoroughly enjoyed the slapstick humor (as did some of the adults) and others found the message of the Christmas spirit and belief in Santa cute and humorous.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|If you're a fan of the series, you have to keep reading.  When a new one is available, have to read it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Batman takes on the rapists, thieves, and miscellaneous scum of Occupy Gotham and puts them in their place.  Bane's haranguing exhortations to the mindless mobs will no doubt be subject to lawsuits from Western college professors who will cry plagiarism.  While a fictional movie, Nolan shows how one determined activist can bend the will of sycophantic sheep to do his bidding...all in the name of fairness and equality, of course.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Easy reading, a different twist for Grisham.  It is more in line with the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew series for kids, but still entertaining.....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It will keep you in your seat wanting MORE!!!! The action if packed & the detail is tight! This show will keep you hooked.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Many episodes were five star but 2 or 3 we rated as 3 or less.  Looking forward to the new season.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|This guy gives a totally fresh view in how to look at the world of risk taking. It gets off a little slow but moves along after you are a little deeper into it. It is a &#34;deep&#34; book intellectually, but an interesting read spiced with humor. Anyone looking for a fresh concept on positioning a portfolio should read this.<br /><br />david
0345803485|5.0|Love story but a little deep and constant sex .  Would have enjoyed more of the love story, without so much sex.  Overall a love story.
B0086700CM|5.0|this has helped my handeye coordination a lot. it is fun a and lets you get little helpers like the resurrection helper. I hope you love it as much as I do.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|If you liked previous Jason Bourne movies you probably like this one. Jeremy Renner has done good job filling in role of<br />previous Jason Bourne.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I needed to read this book...even tho this Dr.'s terminologies were a bit (a lot) over my head I couldn't put it down. A friend told me about the book and she said now she has no fear of dying.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. The couple was adorable, the story was funny & find in love for the first time is amazing. Will look for other books by Mira,  Thanks.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I just didnt like this as well as some of the other angry birds. Definitely didnt feel it was  worth spending any money on but it is what it is I guess. Its fun just not all that for me...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|have been using this for over a year. very stable and reliable.  verry happy with this app! I highly recommend. thanks
B002KKCVY6|5.0|This is simply the best outdoor &#34;working&#34; sandal on the market. Great for hiking, boating, yard work, etc. Comfortable and well constructed. I especially like the traction this sandal provides on wet boat decks.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|at first you think omg this game<br /> is so boring but once you play it for a while it so fun!!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Book makes sex boring.  From page to page nothing changes.  Book 1 was even worse.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The characters weren't well-formed and they start to behave like pretend rather than real people.  The plot starts to get a little too convoluted because the story requires some contrivances, almost like the author wanted to go somewhere but had to get out of another place first.  What she does to accomplish this doesn't satisfy me, it's just too unlike real life might unfold.  There's a number of loose threads that never get resolved or fully connected, the evil one is a little too over the edge to be believable. I wanted to really like this book but ended up skimming through the latter parts just to get it over with and to find out how the characters resolved the problem.
B008VBYN80|5.0|its freaking awesome better than all the rest don't play like you don't know say anything otherwise would be uncigilized yup that's what I said foo
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I wasn't sure I'd like a Bourne movie without Matt Damon, but I really liked this movie. Jeremy Renner did a great job!
B0086213XW|1.0|The movie was boring, slow, had a weak plot, camerwork dizzying, unreal life situations, in general if I were you, I wouldn't waste my time.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Written more for the lawyers. Not enough about his heaven experience, but really felt good. Tottaly lost me in the last portion of the book. Over my head!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it! My fav of the series. Great writing and lots of good mystery aspects. The kinky stuff was awesome too
B0027MJU00|4.0|It was a dark book but kept my interest with mystery as well as interesting characters. As I started reading I did't think I liked it but was caught up in the story and the mystery before it was over and was pulling hard for the main character.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|After seeing KISS' current lineup 3 times live (Alive 35, The Hottest Show on Earth, and The Tour), and having listened to Sonic Boom enough to wear out the CD, new KISS music is just what I needed...or so I thought.<br /><br />Sonic Boom, KISS' previous studio album, is the band's highest charting studio record. As an album, it was cohesive, well-written, and very fun to listen to. Lead single \\"Modern Day Delilah\\"  struck me instantly as a latter-day KISS classic, and to this day, is one of my favorite KISS songs. While I preferred some songs to others, Sonic Boom didn't have any glaring stinkers on the album, and KISS's eagerness to record for the first time in 11 years is felt here.<br /><br />Almost three years later to the day, KISS releases Monster, the current lineup's sophomore release and the band's 20th studio record overall. The song titles alone sounded kick-ass to me: titles like \\"Last Chance\\" , \\"Shout Mercy\\", \\"Long Way Down\\", \\"Wall of Sound\\"...yeah, I was expecting this album to have attitude. If Sonic Boom was a nod to Rock and Roll Over and Love Gun, Monster sounded like a nod to Revenge, with a little Destroyer mixed in (even Gene Simmons admitted this several times in interviews). This album would blow me away, right?<br /><br />So I bought the album, and listened to it all the way through about 3 times now. Three things really stand out for me on this album. The first is Eric's drum sound - much heavier than Sonic Boom, albeit not as aggressive as he was on Revenge. His drumming is particularly impressive on \\"Shout Mercy\\" and \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" - my two favorites on this album. Tommy's guitar technique was also a shining star on the album, sounding less like Ace Frehley and more in with his own style - \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\", \\"Outta This World\\", and \\"Last Chance\\" being my favorite Tommy solos on the album. The third thing, unfortunately, is Paul's voice. I wasn't expecting his vocal surgery to make him sing like he did in the 80's, or early 90's,but at least back to how he sounded on the AeroKISS and Rock the Nation Tours. You don't need to be a trained musician or a longtime KISS fan to tell how damaged Paul's voice has become since Sonic Boom.Gene, however, is exactly what you'd expect: groovy bass lines, a decent vocal performance, and songs that don't take themselves seriously.<br /><br />Song by song -<br /><br />\\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" - Sound better live and tuned down a step, though it's not a \\"Modern Day Delilah\\" like I was expecting. A catchy guitar solo and opening lick, but do we really need another \\"take a chance and run with it\\" song by Paul Stanley? Not the best, but far from the worst on this album, and a decent song nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"Wall of Sound\\" - Better than Gene's first song on Sonic Boom, \\"Russian Roulette\\", but gets tiring to listen to after hearing it 3 times.<br /><br />\\"Freak\\" - Supposedly Lady Gaga was going to sing alongside Paul on this song. In all honesty, as much as I don't care for Lady Gaga, she would have saved this song. Friends of mine who like Gaga agree with me - this song had radio airplay potential (and would have been a welcome change from the soul-less music on the radio nowadays). Without her, it's a little tedious to listen to, and Paul's damaged voice doesn't help this song. Having said that, it's a little contrived having rich men in their 60's compare themselves with the social outcasts today. Maybe if this song was written on their earlier albums it would have worked. This late in the game, it's a little smug. Usually I skip this song.<br /><br />\\"Back to the Stone Age\\" - The only song on the record credited to all 4 band members. I get the message of the song - Gene's frustration with technology and longing for simpler days. Gene has never been a lyrical genius, but his lyrics seem to get worse as he ages. Take away the vocals, apart from the opening scream, and you have a great song. Put in the lyrics, and you'll want to cringe. Again, I usually skip this song.<br /><br />\\"Shout Mercy\\" - THIS is the song that should have opened the record. An amazing opening drum fill by Eric, pretty good guitar solo, and a very satisfying Paul scream at the end. The older sister of \\"Modern Day Delilah\\" - this is what I was waiting for. My favorite Paul song on the record, HANDS DOWN.<br /><br />\\"Long Way Down\\" - The album's big time nod to Led Zeppelin, even with a little (very little) of Pink Floyd in there. It's a different song than what I'm used to hearing from KISS, and I applaud them. It takes awhile to warm up to this song, but it's not bad at all, certainly leagues better than the garbage tunes \\"Freak\\" and \\"Back to the Stone Age\\". The album's second single.<br /><br />\\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" - If \\"Shout Mercy\\" was the older sister of \\"Modern Day Delilah\\", than \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" is the same to \\"Hot and Cold\\" from Sonic Boom (my favorite Gene song on that album). An a capella chorus opening the song, Eric's drumming, and Tommy's wah-pedal guitar solo make this song shine on the album. Best Gene song on the record, EASILY.<br /><br />\\"The Devil Is Me\\" - Gene's obligatory Demon song. Much, much better than Sonic Boom's \\"I'm An Animal\\", and not as lyrically horrendous and \\"Stone Age\\", but certainly not \\"Unholy\\" or \\"God of Thunder\\". It's a good song for what it is, but I think having Tommy break away from his bluesy guitar style would have made this song a standout. Less bluesy and more gain on the guitar solo would have given this song sharper teeth. Still not a bad song as is.<br /><br />\\"Outta This World\\" - Solely written by Tommy Thayer, and step up from \\"When Lightning Strikes\\" off Sonic Boom. Definitely a good song; the main riff grabs you more than on aforementioned song. Tommy has the vocal chops, no doubt. But I hope on their next album, Tommy sings about something else besides outer space, lighting, and the weather. Ace did, why not Tommy?<br /><br />\\"All for the Love of Rock and Roll\\" - I thought it would be anothercampy KISS song, in reality, one of the standouts on the album. I actually started smiling ear to ear when I heard the track off KISSONLINE. Eric shines on this tune, an biographical song about his journey to stardom that fits him as a musician, rather than The Catman in KISS. More than any other song on the record, it's a happy, upbeat tune where you can't get the riff out of your head. Hats off to Eric, and the band, for a well-written and recorded tune.<br /><br />\\"Take Me Down Below\\" - Like \\"Freak\\" and \\"Stone Age\\", \\"Take Me Down Below\\" is a throwaway song on the album. I applaud Gene and Paul singing together, but it's a boring track. Simplest KISS baseline I've ever heard, the worst lyrics on the album, and the fact you have two 60 + year old men singing about screwing women. A little gross at their age, huh?<br /><br />\\"Last Chance\\" - This song feels unfinished. Another extra minute on this song would have helped - maybe adding in a different riff for the verses rather than continuing the same riff from the chorus would have been good. Tommy has a great guitar solo here, one of his best on the album. \\"Last Chance\\" doesn't give the album the same kind of closure \\"Say Yeah\\" did on Sonic Boom. Again, it feels very unfinished - a reworked and expanded version of this song would have been terrific.<br /><br />\\"Right Here, Right Now\\" - the iTunes bonus track. Not worth the exclusive hype, there's a reason it's a bonus track and didn't make it onto the standard release of the album.<br /><br />All in all, is Monster a bad album? No, I think it's still worth buying, although maybe at a discounted price. Definitely heavier and more riff oriented than Sonic Boom. The good songs shine and the band songs wreak - cutting \\"Freak\\", \\"Stone Age\\", and \\"Take Me Down Below\\" from the final version of the album would still warrant the $10 I paid for it on release day. Tommy really earns his place in KISS on this record, while Monster shows why KISS has stuck with Eric for nearly 20 years (reunion tours aside). Though this album does show Gene and Paul's age, and although both of them give a solid enough performance, you can't help but wonder how much steam they have left. I've long accepted the fact KISS would never write another \\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"Shout it Out Loud\\", \\"Love Gun\\", \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\", or even another \\"God Gave Rock and Roll To You.\\" Don't get me wrong, there are enough good songs on the album to warrant buying it, but nothing that will overshadow established KISS Klassics, not by a long shot.<br /><br />Standout tracks: \\"Shout Mercy\\", \\"Long Way Down\\" \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\", \\"Outta This World\\", \\"All for the Love of Rock and Roll\\"
0316174483|5.0|i believe i have as much or more fun with this book than my girls.  we make cards.  i even made the mantal a pretty pic with santa and reindeer this year.  we love this book.  gave the girls ideas on how to draw things that we struggled to draw.  and then when we were tired of drawing we just got paint on our fingers and went to town like the artist did in this book.  so much fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show is very addicting and every ending leaves you in suspense ! All I know is that Daryl better stay alive through out the season ! Everyone that I know who is just starting to watch season 1 is already hooked its an awesome show all around !!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Not really bad, not very good.  Donald Sutherland was awful, but, then, most of the acting---no, all of the acting---was weak.  Jennifer Lawrence was like a zombie in overplaying the grimness of her situation---which was grim.  Harrelson came to closest to giving a good performance.  I got through it, but barely.
B009HEMW4W|3.0|Story line is OK, lame at times, predictable. Nevertheless the set up is good and actors are good as well
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. it was worth the money I payed for it. I would recommend it to a friend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book- an amazing story packed with suspense!  Little slow at the beginning but really picks up towards the end.  Highly recommend this book to anyone.
B009KHCT94|4.0|Loved it. The story is great and really entertaining. In some parts a little bit cheesy, but after all I would give it 4 stars for entertainment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this was my first nicholas sparks novel  , i could not put the book down  , katie is  on the run from her abusive husband with no family to turn to she is all alone in the world . katie settles in a small town and slowly starts to open up with her only friend a woman named jo .

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This was a really bad movie.  Just not funny at all. I'm not going to waste time telling you what it's about, but I will tell you not to waste your time watching it.  Seth MacFarlane has become a lazy writer, or he's just run out of fresh ideas.  I would have loved the tribute to Flash Gordon, because that's one of my favorite cheezy movies of all time, but the fact that it was included in such a bad movie ruined it for me.  I had to force myself to finish watching this.  Twelve year olds might find it amusing, because they will get to hear dirty words and watch a teddy bear smoke pot.  Should have been relegated to an SNL skit.  Oh, and Marky Mark has the same cardboard charisma he has in all of his movies.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Movie rental from Amazon that was of great quality and a really good movie. Just like most movies though, the second is never as good as the first.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Book is well written, moves at a good pace, so not boring, and overall is an excellent read. I highly recommend it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I downloaded this for my mother and she plays it all of the time. It was one of the best games that she has had on her tablet.
B004LWZW88|5.0|We love this movie. And it's just my husband and me. Great price for a great movie – BlueRay and DVD! Watch
B0076DELIG|5.0|Like the way the mystery unraveled.  Cold case files are hard to solve because of the \\"tired\\" evidence, but Connelly made it believable.  I liked the way he weaved history in with the present.  He created suspense and feeling of danger.  A few events were not entirely credible, but overall a very good mystery novel.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Overall, this movie did not disappoint. I gave it 4 stars as it was funny along with being touching in moments. It also had a decent story line. Good movie to rent (or buy for the collection)!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Bad acting, worse script - a complete waste of time - unless you're into \\"bathroom\\" humor - and even fr that perspective, it was horrible.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This is the greatest! Love being able to move photos from my camera with such ease. Would recommend this to anyone & have!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Ended up at a price of $27.96 I believe. Arrived Dec 6th, 2 days after official release. I was at BestBuy (sadly I know) and the BluRay combo pack for just &#34;Rises&#34; was $24.99. Here I got all three for $9.32 with shipping. Feel sorry for you if you missed out! I bought 5 of the Trilogy packs. 1 for me and 4 for gifts. Perfect as always Amazon!
B009P5K4HK|4.0|Great addition to the Winehouse collection. I can't say enough good things about this set if you're an Amy fan. The Dingle dvd is about an hour long. It contains 6 songs in a stripped down format with just guitar and bass. There are also portions of an interview with Amy and others between songs along with some nice shots of Dingle. The UK version of this set has two additional dvds. One being a tribute and another being a 2007 Porchester Hall concert. Having seen some of the clips from the Porchester show it looks great. It is a shame this was not released in the US. Bottom line: if you're an Amy fan buy this set and hope the other material is released separately in the near future.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a nice app.  My only complaint is that using from a KF the screen isn't large enough.  It's annoying that pieces are covered up on the side, and there's no room to spread them out.  But I had no problems moving the pieces, and I like that when you find pieces that fit they lock together.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|My book club read this book and found it very interesting and enjoyable to read. I would recommend it. I'm giving copies to people I know.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've played.  Kept me interested for days.  Great graphics and music, too.  Some of the puzzles were pretty hard.  I do wish there were a few more instructions on some of these.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary, along with a couple others, removed the blinders from over my eyes; the first was Food Matters. I tell you what, this is real life that scientist are playing with...our lives. After seeing Food, Inc all I could think about was that up until my 29th year in life I had no problem drinking milk and then all of sudden while in Kosovo I sat down to enjoy a nice cool glass of milk with my chocolate chip cookie. By the time I had finished eating and started making my way outside to my domicile I grew increasingly ill, I vomited so hard that I hurdled over in convulsions and my sides were caving in. By the time I reached the medical facility I had spots all over face and my eye had a contusion.  I was told that I was allergic to milk. WHAT! That was in September 2000. After that sometimes eating scrambled eggs made me puke, while sitting at the table I'd have to run to the toilet. I was angry, I couldn't understand what had happen to me concerning diary. I switched to Soy milk and soy products; stopped even eating my beloved eggs and less bread. Since that time, I am now diagnosed as vitamin D deficient (2011), my level of vit D is 14 the normal range is 32 or so, which is strange b/c I ate my share of vegetables. Since seeing this documentary and others like it I am drinking and eating more organic Non-GMO products. I even drink milk...NON-GMO MILK and I'm eating eggs again (No added Hormones, No Antibotics, Cage Free and Non-GMO) along with other foods that I had to stop eating b/c I was feeling sick to my stomach, sluggish and over bloated. I feel like my life has been saved. Thanks be to God.  I am willing to pay more for organically non modified food...natural food, in order to be healthy. They are even crossing fish DNA in our tomatoes in order to enable them to withstand cold winter frost (youtube). WTH!<br />I think it's an all out shame that food grown and sown naturally is costing us more at the grocer, when it should be the other way around. When I see something that reads FDA approved I want to scream in disgust. When I see something with the little green butterfly or/and Non-GMO on it I feel so relieved and on the inside I exhale and thank God. We can't all grow our own vegetables and raise livestock so for heaven's sake thank God for the organizations that are for the people not only for the dollars.<br />This documentary changed my life for the better.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A much needed &#34;Proof&#34; for folks who see science as their god. This man has shown us that we are here for far bigger reasons and that LOVE is really all that matters.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|The tension between Castle and Beckett is extreme... but I already know how it is resolved so it's not as annoying as one might think. The show is smart and funny... just the way I like my cop dramas!
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I do not like to give negative reviews, so I will just simply say I did not enjoy anything about this movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved it literally couldn't put it down. If you enjoyed fifty shades you will like the second book even more. You got to know more about Christian and his live for Ana.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the Robinson Crusoe book for astronauts. I read this book in about 14 hours (give or take) over two days and it's incredibly hard to put down.<br />I'd describe it as very interesting, with lots of twists and turns that keep you turning the page over and over again and with no obvious scientific inaccuracies (as much as I know). It's actually pretty realistic, the author did his research.<br /><br />More interesting than (or at least as) WOOL.<br />Now that I've read it, I can say that it's easily worth $2,99 like the other ebooks.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It's typical Bourne and pretty decent take and interweaving of the other movies.  I'd rent it again, but I did prefer Matt Damon in the past movies.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Be prepared for a slow opening.  The exposition section of the book is sometimes rather heavy going and concentrates a great deal upon his background and spiritual journey.  Once he is on the ship and ultimately on the boat with the tiger, the pace accelerates although it continues to be thoughtful.  I liked the book, but I did not find it to be a spiritual book which is generally the way it is promoted.  I think the spiritual element is present, but does not necessarily dominate as much as I expected.  The descriptions are particularly well written and, at times, almost lyrical.<br />I enjoyed the book, but it would not be my first choice in a novel to read.<br />kittynix
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It's not a mind bending drama or action flic, but it's a decent comedy and funny enough. if you watch Family Guy, you'll enjoy it.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|From the sets, to the costumes by Ralph Lauren, to the story, by Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby is a film well worth watching.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|By only being able yo use the ONE camera it's completely impossible to take actual photos you can use unless you're in love with your own facial features. I wish I knew how to delete apps!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book with 2 kids and 2 jobs I still found time to read it!! I'm so ready for the next one to come out!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great! Love it! Works perfectly and just as we'll as my iPod and PC version! Wish I'd found it much earlier
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I read this for my book club and enjoyed it.  A lot to discuss at our club.  I did find that at times it was too talking and he repeated himself a few times.  I have read true crime stories that read like fiction because they were so well written.  All in all, I did enjoy the book though.
B0071MQ37E|5.0|I have watched many versions of this stage play.  This one far exceeds any of them.  It is absolutely magnificent!  I highly recommend it to everyone.  The actors are far superior to any I have ever watched.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Who doesnt love the polar express??? its a great flick. Good for kids and adults alike, a great gift idea.
B00004YRQA|5.0|PS2 Memory Cards..... Never had one fail. Oh not enough words to submit. Hmm 7 more words.. three two one. BAMM
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Sean does a fantastic job of keeping this material approachable and not-too-technical for the layperson.  However, that doesn't mean it's dumbed down or trivial.  Get a front row ticket to the history of particle physics and collider politics from an engaging and thoroughly readable author.
B00008973A|1.0|Saw the play on Broadway.  Saw the movie.  Possibly the worst translation of a play to a movie in history.  And even leaving the play out of it, one of the worst movies I've seen.  Save your money.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Kept waiting for Ted to come out. Worth the wait. Really hilarious. Wahlberg perfect for the role. Wife and I were in tears during some of the scenes and Ted's dialogue. By the way...we are in our 50s and the humor was raunchy at times, but GREAT! Hope there's a sequel.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|If you like Ian Rankin's Rebus - this is a great page turner.  Fans will be happy that Rebus is back on the scene and now that he is quasi-retired he can really let it rip.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Told from a dog's perspective, this novel offers an unusual analysis of human endeavors. It is compelling reading (I finished it in three days), and it leaves one with much to reflect on without being overly maudlin. I'd recommend this novel.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Several of my friends and I saw this at the movies when it first came out,and I just had to own it!<br />I am lending it to a friend who has terminal cancer and I think it will bring her some solace. It is<br />one of the most heart warming movies to grace the screen in a long time.My hats off to the directors.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Engaging and profound.  I watched the movie first and then read the book. I found the book provides more important context that cannot be fully expressed in the movie - though I like the movie a lot too. Definitely recommend.
0316228532|5.0|This is not HP and thank God for it.  I love HP and have read all the books twice, but after hearing some interview with JK you get the feeling that this is the book that means the most to her.  This is her view of the world lost but with hope if we can all not only see but also promote the good in others.  Causal Vacancy depicts the gritty underbelly of a town that is seemingly ideal, and how local politics are made from petty emotions rather then logic.  Great book that is 'magical' in a very different way from HP.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Enjoyed it as much as the first one. It is hard to give a movie 5 stars. This is definitely worth renting
B00002N9ER|5.0|The price on these locally is ridiculous; but, the price here is fantastic.<br /><br />Holds my big MagLite over the roughest terrain.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The basic plot is good.  I saw the movie, and for once the movie is better.  This is a very easy read.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|so glad I got this app it makes purchasing through ebay quick and smooth.  click bid pay and done.  I really like it and would definitely recommend it to others.
B00632HWOG|1.0|this app worked perfectly..... until the update. now it force closes ALL THE TIME i cant even read an email
B00846REIS|5.0|Anyone who has read the 50 shades series will really enjoy this story - hoping this series continues as yummy as the first book has started it off! Definitely will check out more by Sylvia Day....
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|One of the few applications for the Kindle Tablet that is so well optimized. Everything is incredibly smooth and changing between articles is lightning fast.
B0000256KE|5.0|Have you ever tried to describe early Roxy Music to someone that's never heard them before ?  I have. It's impossible. There is nothing to compare them to...and that's a good thing. I myself got on the Roxy train a bit late ( 1975 ) but upon hearing them I bought everything by them that I could get my hands on. You cannot go wrong with those first 5 Roxy Music albums. Each one stands alone as a testament to these guys' talent and Bryan Ferry's incredible songwriting.  For Your Pleasure ( album no.2 ) is my personal favorite. This would be a desert island top ten for sure. Every song on this album is great. Do The Strand,Editions of You,and Grey Lagoons are my faves but really there's not a weak track on the thing. This is some very original,ground breaking music going on here. I understand that the sessions for this album were tense as control of the group's musical future was split between Bryan Ferry's more romantic pop leanings and Brian Eno's more experimental approach. The two styles collide perfectly on this album. I mean..c'mon...a love song to an inflatable love doll ? And this was years before that subject was approached on the first Police album. And Eno's snyth solo on Editions of You ? Probably the one and only time I've ever caught myself playing \\" air \\" synthesizer. You can bet future Cars mastermind Ric Ocasek was listening close to this album. The first Roxy Music album had the ( and I almost hate to use this term ) \\" shock and awe \\" factor. But this album took all those elements and, along with Chris Thomas' sterling production,turned it into something warmer and maybe even more sinister. This is one of those albums where the music contained therein is represented fairly well by the album cover itself. That cover photo is what this thing sounds like. You need this one. Trust me.
B00471TLZS|5.0|Poltergeist is one of the best paranormal movies ever made.  I don't really consider it horror, but I suppose it is in that genre.  It's really a great movie.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Dramatic, humorous, irreverent, and witty --- everything you need for a cozy night in with the hubby or the girls.<br />Plus, I received the DVD way before the expected date of arrival. Well done.
B009HELT3C|3.0|I like Will and Tommy Lee, or this would have gotten two stale stars instead of three.  But it kept the kids quiet...
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix is such a unique group. For only five voices to produce this quality of sound and depth is extraordinary.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|The Title is misleading.  This is a well done tasteful story for any and all couples that have drifted apart but still love each other..
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I hope there is a book 2 underway.  Megan and Connor &#34;Carter&#34; deserves a little more exploration.  Now that, Conner/Carter (smile) is on her good side again, there could be a lot more to more . . .
B008M34CSI|2.0|I don't remember it. And i only saw it a couple of weeks ago.  So either my memory is locked out, OR, the movie was forgettable.
B0085157B8|1.0|I would give the movie a no star . I WOULD NOT RENT THIS MOVIE unless boobs and stupidity is your cup of tea.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Trying to recapture the Bourne saga without the Jason himslef is like casting the Easter Bunny as Santa Claus.  Story was a rehash.
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|A must have.<br />Could use some syntactic updating to c99.<br />But the stuff within is still pure, even entertaining and nostalgic in the way it is dated.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|A well acted Interesting Story; the cast played well into the story line, which was not as predictable as we thought it would be.
B000YRY7TO|5.0|Wǒ ài nǐ, chénglóng, nǐ shì měihǎo hé yàmǎxùn shǐde tā gèng róngyì gòumǎi nǐ de diànyǐng, bìng gàosu wǒ de háizi, wǒ ài gōngfu dehuà, wǒ zuò zhèxiē if you speak Mandarin awesome- you must see the original and read the sub titles it makes the movies better
B0088WGBC8|3.0|Of course Denzel is always one step ahead of death and other mayhem. And the movie was very entertaining and had some interesting scenes.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|It is a well developed find the object game with  a good story line and interesting characters. The pictures have details that may be hard to see on smaller devices.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Please No More Dark Knight conglomerations of excessive violence and disappointing story lines.  The Dark Knight story line is mindless.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by this series, starting from the very short 1st part which stands on it's own as a very rich short story.  The next pieces are much more elaborate and flushed out, if less 'literary'  - and each offer surprises and very full and interesting plots and characters.  The author has done an amazing job of extending and expanding the scope of the tale, for example the foreshadowing of the purpose of Silo 1 as a foundation for the Shift volumes to come later.  The story(s) is(are) eventful, fast paced, sinister and smart.  Lots of characters to root for and against.<br /><br />The reader will continually shift their allegiance from character to character and group to group as the tales unfold.  The reader's perspective of who is right and wrong, good or bad, will also shift, for example the role played by the IT Directors of each Silo can be viewed with particular schizoprenia.<br /><br />And yet through it all, it is never clear what is real on the other side of the sensors.  Even after reading 2nd shift, i am not confident that what's on the other side of the hills surrounding the silos wont turn out to be green grass after all.<br /><br />This is a complex work and includes very solid themes, especially the idea that what seems to be real actually could be a fake.  I've come to the conclusion that the title 'Wool' refers to the fact that every character, from the Silo people to the IT people to the folks in Silo 1, to the frozen and unfrozen - all of them might actually have the Wool pulled over their eyes.!<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the way the author gradually portrays the senator & politicians & big government to be more and more sinister and corrupt and dangerous.  And then suddenly exposed as the Democratic party just before TEOTWAWKI.  Or is it?  Will the author actually find a way to redeem Democrats in future twists??  Has the author pulled the wool over my eyes???<br /><br />Too fun, i read the entire omnibus over a couple of days and i expect this to be one of the few books that i've read that i'll come back to and re-read in a few years time.<br /><br />I will definitely confidently recommend.<br /><br />well done, Hugh.
B005HSL626|5.0|my opinion is they should not fall to the ground they should stop in the middle and wait 5 seconds to answer then fall to ground.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Easy to read, very interesting story line. Makes you think about how you view time, relationships,work and life in general.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|This action packed movie is a nice wrap up for the Greek mythos.  It is too bad that the storyline did not leave much room for sequels, but at least the heroes had happy endings.
0316069434|2.0|Michael Connelly has no greater fan than me.  I have read all of his books and enjoy both the many Harry Bosch books and the non-Bosch books.  I think Connelly is the best living writer and as good as any American ever in this genre.  I am amazed at the consistent quality of his writing over so many years and books.  Having said that, my first disappointment was in Nine Dragons.  Harry was still Harry in that book, but the story was the first one where the plot was so over the top that I didn't believe it.  Connelly's strengths are many: character development, dialog, exciting but plausible storylines.  Harry is the most interesting, fallible, contradictory, full faceted police detective ever created, in my opinion.  The dialog is of the highest order - gritty, gutsy, human, believable.  And despite the challenge of creating interesting storylines, which by the nature of the genre necessarily repeat themselves, Connelly has done this admirably - or used to.<br /><br />As I read The Black Box, I noted how slow and long the prologue was.  I wanted to believe that Connelly was intentionally allowing Harry to slow down and 'act his age'.  But the story never really picked up - it remained flat almost until the very end.  And Harry seemed less full of that essential Harryness that has made me look forward to each new Bosch novel - to be able to revisit that imperfect, flawed, fascinating character that I always wanted to meet in person.  He just seemed ordinarily irascible and uninspired.  And for the first time, I felt the dialog was way below Connelly's standard.  Too often, I was embarrassed to hear the words coming out of Harry's mouth.  So, on all three levels - story, character and dialog, The Black Box failed.  I am disappointed in this book, and sad that I am no longer looking forward to the next Harry Bosch novel.  Fortunately, I can return to the older novels to visit my old friend.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I use it whenever I am out and about with my tablet. Amazing how many wifi signals there are and even more amazing how many people don't secure their networks.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Most insightful book i've read in a very long time. A good read for anyone questioning the meaning of life. This book gave me a lot of perspective.
B003LXSY60|5.0|This was a freebie with a code.  I really like the Black Keys very much.  I am a music lover but I don't have the vocabulary to describe this music and do it justice.  It is good music.  I think every song on this is good.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Very nice selection of radio stations.  I am playing x- mas selections.  many sources available to this to do this on this app.  I would definitely recommend this  app. takes some practice to learn to use.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is a very niffty app I recommend getting it. its also free if you don't wanna buy a regular alarm clock
B0073LWEXK|1.0|This game will not play on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  It loads and will only go thru the first two screens.  Very disappointing.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Hysterically funny!! Loved it!!!! It was a funny and touching movie! Seth is a genius!!!! Loved it when Ted's stuffing came out!!
B001E75QGG|5.0|We are fans of this movie and would definitely recommend it to anyone else who follows these movies.  Great price and value for the money.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Didnt live up to the other 3 excellent movies. Should have ended at a trilogy while it was great. This felt like hollywood trying (and failing)  to capitalize on past success without a lot of effort.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is great, watch it. It has everything a show needs to suck you into it's world and keep you on the edge of your seat.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I'm new to this but I think HD camera take good pictures.I would recommend it to all my family and friends.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Nice eye candy but lousy plot.........I was disappointed after all the promotion. Of course I still love Matthew and others
B006C3Q6GG|2.0|Two friends recommended this author's series.  Within one of the rewiews that I read on Amazon the reviewer commented that one should read this first book first as it sets the tone for the followings stories and allows you to understnad the relationshsip between Aubrey and Maturin.  I have read several nautical adventure stories which I have enjoyed.  The Master & Commander was very difficult to get through for me. It makes assumptions that the reader already knows about the workings, hierarchy and practices of the British Royal Navy during that time period. Much of what was mentioned in this story about such things was lost as there was no or minimal explanation.  The book was loaded with old english terminology, slang, the names of the differant sails  and nautical terms where I  could not undertand what was happening.  You need a dictionary to understand a large portion of this story and possibly a book giving pictures of the differant styles of older wooden ships and which shows the names of the differant sails and where they attached to the mast.  Otherwise, a large part of the store is meaningless. Also, there were many times when I could not figure out who was speaking or whose thoughts were being written.  During the coming winter nights I will read the second book in this series to see if the writting gets any better.  If not I will let Mr. O'Brian's writing stay in Davey Jones' locker
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|If you love Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda, you'll love this movie.  I loved the seeing ladies adventures in Dubai.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am a big reader of SiFi.  I enjoy a author that is so visual that in your mine you can see everything they do. This book is all that.  Loved it !!!!
B000W15B24|5.0|This is a great set of tunes from the man in blcak. I love to play this at night when some rain is hitting the windows.
1609611543|5.0|So many \\"diet\\" books are either super corny or drier than a crouton in the desert. This book is informative and easy to read. The bibliography of cited references is impressive and further supports the books message. To the author: message received, acknowledged, and accepted. Mission objectives understood and proceeding ask recommended.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Loved every second of it. If you love video games, 80s movies, and action. You will love it.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I loaded the app on my phone, but when I want to purchase a song the item tells me the app is not on it.
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|This book is a good read for active runners and old , not active ones. Some of our high school cross country runners are also enjoying it.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Love this show.  Can't say much besides that.  Smallville is an excellent series, so if you are a fan of the show, you will be a fan of the DVDs.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Loved it since I was a kid! Enjoyed watching it again. I Love Tim Burton movies. Fun movie for anyone.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Pinocchio is one of the best Disney films of all time.  It has extraordinary animation, beautiful singing, and a wonderful story to tell complete with lessons for the children watching.  It is entertaining for both children and adults alike.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I love the idea of going back and looking at the zombie war from a historical perspective. However this also made for a less than exciting ending but the rest of the book was great.
0394721772|5.0|What else can one say about Julia Child except that she creates perfection.  If you follow the steps in her books, you will cook like a professional.  Read carefully, follow exactly, and she will walk you through things you never thought you were capable of.  If some of her steps seem unnecessary or overly detailed to you, do yourself a favor and try it at least once without skipping anything she says - her little details really do produce incredible, worthwhile results.  Only thing with Volume 2 - it does refer to master recipes in Volume 1 quite often.  So if you are looking to purchase this book, be sure to have the other as well.  I have cooked some of the best meals of my life by following her tips.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Interesting Old-style graphics make this a nice to play game.  Sometimes though it can be hard to control your guy/spy good enough to get him where you want without dying.  I liked the idea and game play was fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Makes me ready and interested in tuning in for more!<br />Angela Landsbury added a great touch and Maggie Smith was priceless as usual!
B0090YHSFC|4.0|I enjoy Penguins, they are wonderful creatures, and this game is a nice variation of your slicing game that involves them.  The object is to slice of enough of a predetermined amount of ice to fill some drink/cup on the side.  You must keep all the Penguins together and cannot slice a chunk of ice that separates them.  You can and are supposed to - in higher levels - slice and separate the Penguins from a Walrus, which was fun.  This game gets hard pretty quick and can be a challenge slicing off enough ice to complete the level with the Penguins bustling around as much as they do, with extra challenges as you progress to try and only slice 3 times in order to get the full 3 stars on some levels.  Fun game, good graphics, and challenging levels.
B00A5052YE|5.0|This is a very personal and heartfelt cd. I loved every track. This is probably one of her best pieces of work.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|This is your basic Chess game - at least that's all I play it for, to play against the computer.  There are other game modes, but I am not that knowledgeable of the variations of Chess to care to play those other modes.  The graphics look good and the game play is smooth and very playable.  It's fun and I enjoy playing it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Not a lot to say, it's a calculator that works, and it's free.  No complaints here.  For the price how can you go wrong?
1416511946|5.0|He had a rough go of his addiction but very happy he overcame it ! Definitely a must read if you or someone you know battles addiction
B007X10OLE|4.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack, to a fantastic television series. If you enjoy the series and the music on the series, then this is the soundtrack for you. If you love Broadway and showtunes, you will also love this soundtrack. And, if you're the type that just likes positive, feel good music, then this too is the soundtrack for you.<br /><br />What a talented ensemble cast of performers.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|As first, I was disappointed because the game seemed too easy and too short. However, that was just the end of the first chapter. The game got more challenging after that; I even had to use a few hints. The hints on this game are just that ---hints. You can choose how much information that you want revealed.
B000XXTCF8|4.0|Van Morrison is a true talent and is highly respected on a global scale for his music. Not only is he a talented singer, but he plays a multitude of instruments and is a talented songwriter, as well. His stage performances are truly transcendental, his music a mix of soul, R&B, and Jazz, with a spiritually inspired twist of Celtic tradition and a stream of consciousness narrative.<br /><br />Morrison has received considerable acclaim, including six Grammy Awards, the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, being inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and appearing on several &#34;Greatest Artists&#34; lists.<br /><br />If you love Van Morrison this is a must have album; if not then I encourage you to purchase this record, as I am sure you won't regret it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Vince Flynn, even though his material is very violent, but I feel it is God's judgment for the wicked.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A very nice book. Very predictable but does have some unexpected turns. I would definitely get another book by this author.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Very engaging!<br />I really like the descriptive style of writing.<br />It is easy to imagine the characters and their surroundings.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have not seen an NCIS show yet that I have not liked and I own on DVD all seasons 1-9.  I missed a few current episodes and could not wait for season 10 to come out on DVD to see what I had missed..
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Sanderson is my new go-to fantasy writer. Virtually everything he creates is worth reading. This was a stellar, but quick, read.
B001NCL382|5.0|The songs are all colossal hits, and it saves money over buying all the individual albums. A must for every collection.
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|Rebus is becoming unbelievable in his need to annoy others, much of it was pointless. Could not buy the ending.
B00122TEPM|5.0|If you like Led Zeppelin, you'll be very glad you found this.  Many tracks on this album completely Rock!  Couple nice slow rock songs too.  All performed very well.  Robert Plant is still very closely following Led Zeppelin style song progressions. Guitar work and drum work is really outstanding.  Phil Collins plays drums on most tracks (Cozy Powell on the others) with Robert Plant's vocals, in a classic Led Zeppelin style...  1982...  Cool stuff.
0307970299|3.0|I guess I missed the point<br />It was an interesting story, but I'm not sure I came away from any  new insights,<br />Just how easy lack of planning can go awry .<br />Well written though
1476712042|5.0|Considering how emotionally unhealthy Travis is I should not be totally in love with his character but I am. There are so many things about the relationship between Travis and Abby that make me want to tell both of them to run in the other direction. Many of the things said about this book in negative posts are true but some how I had to keep reading and I wanted them together. There are times when unhealthy people just fit together and you want it to work and this is one of those instances.    Intentions matter a lot to me and both characters always wanted the best for each other and the only thing that trumps good intentions is physical violence or malicious emotional abuse since Travis and Abby had neither directed at each other I was able to forgive the other problems and just enjoy. Since I am a woman I was able to identify with Abby and that meant that she irritated the s*** out of me sometimes. I read a review that likened this book to black tar heroin and I would say it wasn't far off, once I was five chapters in I couldn't stop reading until I was done. Finished this book in a day and then in a four month time period I read it four more times, don't judge me, I missed Travis!    For the record I have never dated a bad boy, I have always run in the other direction but this book made me admit that I love bad boys and only in books can I get invested in one.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|it was great just like the first two.  I hope there is a number four, and 5 , and 6, and 7 and more...
B000K4WPCC|4.0|There are faults with the plot of this film. I remember thinking, &#34;OMG, this will be the male version of The Craft!&#34; The reality is its not that good but I still gave it 4 stars because I find it damn entertaining anytime you put that many attractive men in one movie. I bought it for my best friend and we regularly watch this movie for no good reason other than, as we call it, &#34;The pretty of it all.&#34;<br /><br />I know its a bad film but I still like it, sue me. It is bad in a way I still find enjoyable and to be fair it wasn't billed as the greatest movie ever. Even The Craft was a surprise hit so my expectations for this film were not that high and it didn't disappoint.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I thought this was a great movie , I would watch more like this. keep them comming, I will sat here and wait.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|although there was some pretty good action this movie was long and drawn out. If they had made this into a 1/2hour show it might have been pretty good. Some unbelievable plot twists. Bruce Wayne goes from barely being able to walk to fighting and beating on a musclebound giant????<br />Not worth the rental fee or the time to watch it.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|This little gadget is just the trick for hooking my USB mic up to my iPad and iPhone 5 so I can record decent-sounding voice clips for podcasts. I was disappointed that it does not work with my husband's iPhone 4, as its description says, but otherwise, I recommend.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|While this movie is strong on action and good graphics, the truth is that Matt Damon would have done a MUCH better job. This is not meant to take away from this actor, who does do a credible job, BUT the sense, at least to this viewer, was off.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have been using the old version and liked it.  this update just messes things up.  I can not add contacts or have my email addresses auto filled.<br /><br />stay away from this update.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|I spent a very long type deciding to purchase a stylus. I read expert reviews etc. I finally (and it is not normal how long I spent before a purchase) ordered this stylus and the Bamboo one as well. They are both very good. I love this one because it is so sturdy and great to use for notes. I think more than one stylus is necessary given your needs. I worried about scratching my screen etc. This is also great if you have children or grandchildren. It is a must have not as you only stylus - but if you want to utilize all the iPad and others offer and want to use for certain purchases. This is sort of like a black Sharpie everyone should have. Oh and excellent writing in all widths the program you use offers...<br />Plus you will never need to worry about replacing the &#34;nib&#34; or any part of this stylus.
B000S9WLBY|5.0|The &#34;Greatest Generation&#34; always portrayed the Japanesse Soilder as less than human. It was refreshing to see a more realistic presentation of the devastation of war on both sides. Governments decide to go to war not people.  I suspect that the regular Japanesse Soilder would have preferred to be home loving their families and tending to their beautiful gardens.  Thank you  Clint Eastwood.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Excellent, except there is not text to voice component. Works in conjunction with my stand alone Kindle and I highly recommend it. The price is right..
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Interesting portrayal of an interesting and volitale time in the history of the United States. I am intrigued to read more about Lincoln after reading this.
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|I liked the story.  It was not to much fluff, believeable writing and great use of special effects without overdoing it.
B004NELBPC|4.0|The articles are unbiased and unpartisaned in their reporting. Besdes, I kind of like Ariana Huffington. I think that is a pretty and sophisticated lady.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Not Batman begins.  Not the same Bane, and Catwoman was not believe able.  violence without reason doesn't make a move good.  nuff said
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Very cute movie for the holiday season.  Adults will smile as well.  More for kids still a great family movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an excellent novel. It was entertaining and well written. Although some may not like the ending I found it to be suitable. Events in life don't always end as we think they should.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I loaded on my Samsung tablet, love it.  It is much better than carry the real book and Kindle book are more affordable.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Another fantastic read from Brandon Sanderson!  This one is definitely on the shorter side (intentionally, not a surprise), but he manages to pack in a wonderful story, world, magic system, and characters.  It definitely left me wanting to read a sequel, prequel, follow-on, something... give me more!
B000WZAE1I|4.0|This is a fantasy with the twist of a stone wall serving as a separation between our world and a fantasy world of witches, stars and magic. I liked the metamorphosis of the lead character learning that a pretty girl is no match for real love. The overall story line was interesting with unexpected visual effects like murdered brothers talking to each other in the afterlife.<br /><br />PARENTS BEWARE there are some scenes that will emotionally disturb children and I did not want to see. Although we know witches use animal organs for looking into the future, the disemboweling was disturbing. Other murders included beheading and stabbing.<br /><br />Objective criticism: the final battle is way too long and the characters act contrary to their personalities. The movie is long enough and dragging it out at the end was unnecessary.
B00AAQ7JNA|1.0|This BD has no HD audio (DTS-MA or TrueHD).  It just has the standard Dolby digital.  DO NOT buy.  Cannot believe they put out a blu-ray concert in today's world.  The sound is horrible.  The 2 channel version of the audio sounds just like the TV sound, literally.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital is totally a nightmare to listen too.  I only able to watch 3 songs before turning it off.  It is that bad.<br /><br />Just to give you an idea what a bad production this is, the Blu-ray doesn't even include artwork jacket with song names or anything.  The BD just has the disc and that was it.  I contacted Amazon to get my money back but since I already opened it, I will just throw it in the trash instead.  Please people, DO NOT BUY this.
0374214913|3.0|This was a fun fantasy novel that was reminiscent of a grown-up version of the \\"doorway into another world\\" books that so many of us enjoyed as children (C.S. Lewis, Enid Blyton, Madeleine L'Engle, etc.) The part that I found most interested was how closely intertwined the plot was with current technology -- Google (the Company) plays a big part in the story.  One wonders how the book will hold up with this significant investment in cultural references that may or may not last.<br /><br />However, as enjoyable as the \\"quest\\" story was, the ending absolutely ruined the book for me.  It was pat, trite, and  tied up into what felt like a saccharine moment from some feel-good television commercial.  In case you can't tell, I was a bit disappointed.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Some of the scenes are almost ridiculously easy, but most you think about &amp; even try out a few scenarios before you're successful. If you like thinking games &amp; blowing things up you'll love this game. Hey developers, give us some more works too conquer!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you or a family member are struggling with the question of what comes after physical death this is a must read.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|oh so funny and bittersweet at the same time.  I am amazed at the creativity to come up with this story!
B00932A2MC|3.0|If you'd like to sit down and enjoy visual effects and explosions, this is the film for you.  The &#34;love&#34; story is there, but it follows the typical Hollywood formula.  Rihanna was a pleasant surprise as a spunky naval officer with some fight.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Who doesnt love Buddy the Elf!? A new classic rare gem of a Christmas movie that will be celebrated for generations!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Need to use sounds from my kindle fire but as an alarm clock it works absolutly good enough for me.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|It was very strange and how I they ever made a movie out of it, I can't imagine. They must have taken a lot of &#34;literary&#34; license.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large keys with great functions. Just what i wanted. Good for balancing checkbook.her easy to use<br />students can use it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Picks up the story where the hunger games left off and contiues with the action, charm, and furthers the story line. Excellent!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Awesome! I use the app to download training videos for learning to play guitar. Provides easy, local access, saves on bandwidth usage, and usable if no Internet connection is available.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|defend the homeland,<br /><br />  What if something like this movies portraial of  something or someone trying to help theirselves to uor resources.<br />I've done that sort of thing for decades.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|Awesome book! Well worth the read and soooooooooo much better than the movie! Would recommend this for adults and children alike.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|I am currently finishing up \\"The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell\\" by (of all people) Marilyn Manson. I only saw it because it was one of the Kindle Daily Deals. And no, I don't listen to his music (I mean, of course I've heard some of it here and there, but who hasn't?).<br /><br />VERY VERY interesting autobiography. What a life. This guy's so freakin' wierd he's actually interesting. But also obviously very intelligent. Anyways... if you wanna try something different that will keep you turning the pages, give it a shot. I don't really know why, but I certainly can't put it down.
0307455874|1.0|Even though I'm glad, in a bittersweet way, that Obama is President, I still could not read more than 50 pages of his B.S. about &#34;caring&#34; after he's been able to totally stop warring but has let it continue, killing thousands of people in the process.
B0063IH60K|1.0|The game works great; but in exchange for the free app you will get ads that pop-up. I understand the need for ads to fund the app development. I don't understand way ads that are in extremely poor taste are allowed. I removed the app because of the disgusting ads.
B007HACDLK|4.0|ALWAYS LIKE VINCE FLYNN'S WORK!! HAVE READ THEM ALL AND WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE!  USING AMAZON AND MY KINDLE FIRE IS WONDERFUL!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|great app and it works well. I also downloaded the paypal app as well. thanks Amazon for all your hard work .
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I went back in time for couple of hours. I first tripped on this in a DRIVE IN in the 70'S  Do it with a friend
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was simply wonderful. The insights on releigion and zoos were delightful and what I've felt all my life. It was so good I want to see the movie. I've already started to read the book again and find it just as good the second time.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is a good night home at the movies..... Made for the adult..... Just too funny! more than worth the money
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Super fun to listen to! For a debut album, most of the songs were produced really well.Completely happy with this purchase.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funny Movie!  I have a feeling, movies will be more and more funny here in Colorado as everything kicks in.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This was simply not interesting at all.  I won't give any spoilers, but I can tell you if you are a Bourne fan from the Ludlem days and then with the new series, this just did not cut it.  This had nothing to do with the book or Bourne.  The Bourne Legacy book was still all about Bourne, but this movie had nothing to do with him.
B000J233SK|5.0|haunting, good for both background music and intense listening. &#34;dante's prayer&#34;, esp when listened to with a good sound system is beyond excellent.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Clear, concise, relevant.<br />The 4-hour chef is great reading material.<br /><br />Still reading a little every day and restarted reading 4-hour-workweek.<br /><br />Tim, thnx!
B000I0PZ1Q|5.0|Few movies reach the iconic level of social consciousness as does Network. The incidents depicted are a total take off of the SLA and the Patty Hearst incident, but zeitgeist of the 70s and early 80s fear of revolutionaries is clear. A must watch for serious critics of modern film.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|How great is it to see that one of the most successful people in the world (depending on your definition of success) do what he does best. You understand his genius, you understand his way. You may not like it, but you can see why he was so successful.<br />A real book, about a real person.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this! Hard to quit playing! I get into it and can play for a long time!  Every turn is unique and challenging!  Not so challenging that it is frustrating either!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book is so well written that it is captivating!  It reads like a novel and is a page turner.  The author has done a fine job in taking  a very complex period of history and making it so readable.  I have become immensely impressed with Abraham Lincoln as I have learned more about him.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I like Johnny Depp because he is witty and a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. In animations such as this his humor and wit shine through equally so. This is a good story about a lonely little lizard fellow that likes to create alternate worlds within his own world by way of his imagination. Funny and entertaining. Blu-Ray of course is an excellent media platform.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|'Sunshine' is Danny Boyle's unsung masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to give it a go.
B003DZX44I|5.0|The story of Beauty and the Beast is one that can be likened to many personal stories in actual life. A beautiful man is transformed into a beast because he was arrogant and rude. The witch who came into contact with him cast a spell on him making him remain a beast forever unless by his 21st birthday he was able to find true love. The princess is made to stay with him in trade for her fathers release. She stays begrudgingly but in time discovers a tender side to this beast and eventually loves him and breaks the spell that bound him for so many years.
B000JRYOPG|4.0|I am not a film critic of any kind, but i was actually introduced to this movie a while back by my friend who told me it had a good story line to it, plus alot of people can relate to it, like gangsters or just people who hustle and love making money, but putting aside the dirty business. If you search this movie up i am pretty sure other reviewers can explain this movie better then i can.<br /><br />I would rate this on a 5.4, but on the imdb website it has a 5.7 which is not bad, as i said the way i picture this film i'd give it a 3.7/5 on amazon but a it took it by a landslide bumping it to a 4ish, with the great services amazon has been providing me with for over many many years
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This product solved the issue of my not being able to charge my iPhone 4S with my Defender Otter case on. It raises the charger mechanism so the bottom doesn't block the connector. The price is outrageous given what it costs to manufacture. It was however a much needed part for my Sony alarm clock/ iPhone charger I could not do without and they know that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Highly recommed this game.  Very challenging. This requires a little  planning ahead so lt is great for exercising your brain.
B004G6009U|5.0|I like the story and my kids love it too. It is a Cinderella story of sorts but the witch takes the princess away to use her special hair to keep herself (the witch) young. A young man (thief) finds his way into the tower where the kidnapped princess has been hidden for years and she finally leaves the tower where she always thought she had to be, based on the lies the witch told her.<br />She travels the countryside in search of her lost family, finds friends along the way, finds trouble and danger as well and finally reaches her long lost family her greeted her with open arms.
1451627297|1.0|I have never been a fan of Stephen King (my stepfather is-he has just about all the novels). But when he came out with \\"11-22-63\\" last year, my Mom bought it because of my obession over the President Kennedy murder. I hate to tell you this but this is the worst novel I've ever read. As what Daffy Duck said in one of the Looney Tunes' cartoons: \\"I've never been so humiliated in all my life!\\" There are three reasons why I hate this:    1. The author wants us to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy when I now know he didn't (Thank you Jesse Ventura for doing this case on your TV show. Did King do his own research and found out that Oswald was sitting in the second floor lunchroom when the first shot was fired at 12:30-how could he climb four flights of stairs, fired the shots, and come back down? Impossible!). The scene that he writes the main character fighting with Oswald in the sixth floor was (in the words of George Carlin) major league bull***t. I mean, what if someone really did come up there and realized it wasn't Oswald, but actually the imposter? Did King understand what Oswald said that weekend before he was shot by Jack Ruby? \\"I'm just a patsy!\\", \\"I didn't shoot nobody!\\", and the most cryptic: \\"I deny THESE charges!\\" Meaning that not only did he deny killing JFK but not killing Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit (this is where Stephen King should of stopped for a moment and said 'Hmmm, what if there was someone that was doing the dirty work?' but no: he is swimming with \\"The Lone Gunman\\" sharks like Gerald Posner and Vincent Belguosi). When did America turn into the John Wayne western \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\"? (you know-\\"when fact and fiction collide, print the fiction\\")    2. He makes a phrase in which he decribes the time portal as \\"the rabbit hole\\", when it truth he is talking about the vagina hole (thank you Truthiracy House of Wisdom for that exposure). After all, isn't that where we're born, where we will die, and when the time comes,God will call us out of the hole again?    3. King writes an annoying cliche that the past sings (or harmonizes; looks like the author has listened to too many songs from  The Beach Boys). No it doesn't: it may be on the radio with the classic Rock and oldies, but as what legendary writer William Faulkner said: \\"The past is never dead.\\" In other words, it does not die, not sing (just as the future is never written).    I pity these people writting five stars reviews for this book. What part of \\"WAKE UP!\\" don't you understand? It's a safe bet these are the same people that wrote how great the 1968 movie \\"Petulia\\" was when for me that film was also torture for my mind. If Stephen King is reading this, he needs to buy the books \\"Me and Lee\\" (written by Oswald's mistress) and \\"From An Office Window With a High-Powered Rifle\\" and realize that he made a big mistake by making Oswald a monster instead of giving him due process that he was a patsy (in both books the authors state this and name the person they think was really on the sixth floor-remember the rifle used was a German Mauser).
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie; Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale did a wonderful job in their respective roles and thr movie was exciting to the end! Be prepared for a very long viewing as it is close to 3 hours long.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|kids liked it, and there's a message that they get from it.  some darkness but not too bad (compared to what else is out there)
B000F9RB8A|5.0|Now this is not a kid friendly movie but great for adults. I don't believe any movie with violence of any kind is good for children to watch, however this movie is great because of how well they mix the art of kung-fu with the art of moview making. For me they utilized digital cinematography with kung-fu choreography and it just worked really well to create a movie that mesmerizes and entertains quite well. Blu-Ray is an excellent format and makes the movie experience that much more worth the buy. Very happy with my purchase.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very easy to read and get through. As accurate as any other weather predictor. I would recommend it to anyone.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book was interesting to read.  But it left me feeling violated.  A waste of brain mass to have read it.  Definitely WTF?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book it is amazing it gives such grace detail and makes everything feel so real that it is scary
B00136Q6DA|5.0|Sara has an amazing voice and she's not afraid to use it! I've purchased both Little Voice and Kaleidoscope Heart and love them both! If you get the chance, check out her music videos.
B000063V8R|4.0|TNG begins it's climb toward greatness in season three. Seasons 1 and 2 have their moments, but season 3 is when they really start to pull it together. It still has a number of super corny episodes with terrible dialogue, but it also has some of the best episodes in the series; e.g., Yesterday's Enterprise and The Best of Both Worlds Part I.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Words are inadequate to describe this writing....FABULOUS! Thank you Marcus Luttrell. It is necessary for this story to be known by all Americans.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It's an inspiring story with deep and diverse characters. The English prose is great, but the translators also left many phrases and verses in the original languages so as not to lose certain valuable nuances. Read this book!
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Great Confort Movie !!! A Movie to curle up to and watch over and over !! Just a great all around good acting movie that gets you right there in the movie too - Loved it !!
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Great movie.  love it every year great family staple for holiday enjoyment wouldn't be the sme Christmas with out it
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|As an Iranian living thru and expericed the revolution can say details have been beautifully researched and written  it took me back 30 years
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is by far my new fav show. the acting,writing and filming are all top shelf. You wont be dissapointed.  THIS IS NOT FOR PRE TEENS though.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this movie.  I heard some conflicting reviews.  My husband really wanted to see it, so I just went with it.  Just go into the movie with a clear head that this is a movie!  As we all know, teddy bears don't talk.  With that said, there are so many funny parts in it!  I would highly recommend!  Enjoy.
B005HSL626|4.0|I guess it's a good game for your library but I think it's a little violent, would perfer if it didn't have hand granades
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver makes an important statement against &#34;data mining&#34; in this book & reminds us of Bayesian insight.  A must read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can't believe how  hard I try to hit the target and still can't make it, it's good to laugh at oneself and this game is good for that
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This is a great movie. I was a little hesitant because of the title. I rented the movie first then bought it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Every Kendle should have at least one card game, this one is very nice, the graphics are excellent and the response is fantastic!
1451662432|2.0|This book took me a month to read at 615 pages in length.  I was impressed with Arnold Schwarzenegger's recall of events throughout his life as well as his detailed knowledge of the political system of this country as well as California itself.  However, Arnold doesn't spare us the intricate details of economic budgets and public policies and spends hundreds of pages going on and on about it.  This felt repetitious and was a very boring read.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book mostly for Arnold's account of his family life, courtship of Maria Shriver and his journey making action film blockbusters in Hollywood.  However, I was hoping for more on his womanizing as the book only mentions his affair with Bridgette Nielson during the filming of Red Sonia and Mildred the maid during the book's second to last chapter in which he fathers Joseph out of wedlock.  The book stays &#34;hush hush&#34; about everything else.<br /><br />To conclude, I think if you skim the chapter titles and look through all the great pictures, you pretty much get the gist of what's covered in this bloated autobiography of one of Hollywood's greatest action film stars.  I therefore wouldn't recommend that you waste your time reading the book in it's entirety unless you're a big fan of politics or bodybuilding.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My family loves this movie!  We always have a movie night to watch Polar Express at Christmas time.  So much fun!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Quick read and excellent development of the story.  I have recommended it to about 10 friends and they have all enjoyed the read.
B0081BU42O|4.0|This book is certainly a good read, though, in my opinion, not as strong as some of the other &#34;Culture&#34; books
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is an extraordianry writer! I love how her books intertwine the past with the present ~ often with a twist ~ thus giving us an unexpected ending! Beautiful prose!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Contrived and not very well written. It's almost as if it wasn't written by him. At least it was compelling enough for me to finish it, but I can count on one hand the number of books I've put down before the end.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Wow what a let down.<br />Good premise but it just never came together.<br />The acting was pretty good but the story just laid there waiting to be revived.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The clock is a handy app for anyone that has meetings to attend and needs reminders.  I gave it 4 stars because I don't use it very often.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Perfect movie if you go in with no expectations.<br />It starts strong, rolls along and then ends with a nice close and a twist.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|My boyfriend got me into this type of music; I really like Skrillex, his music is rad and I would definitely purchase future songs/albums from him.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Awesome movie! Great time watching it with the family. It is a must buy if you have never seen it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|So glad I purchased this, such a great movie. I plan on buying it for my family member for Christmas
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I first read this wonderful book in 2007 and used the release of the movie as an excuse to re-read it on my Kindle Fire.  It was just as good the second time through.  The only other books I've read more than once are War and Peace, Son of the Morning Star, and Les Miserables.
0345803493|5.0|I bought all three books in the series and I absolutely am hooked in readying these books.  I will definitely buy future books by this author.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Makes reading emails on the Kindle so much easier - took a little while to find my calendar though (it's there under \\"c\\").

B005LAIGPA|2.0|I expected better from this and was greatly disappointed. I would of rather purchased this in the bunker at stores for 3.99 and would not be as disappointed. rent this or wait for bunker diving :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I found this app to be everything I needed - easy to use, visually very intuitive and clear, with an excellent &#34;board&#34; view of all my favorite locations saved which I can instantly click on for detailed weather information. The icons and weather descriptions were also clear, detailed, and easy to navigate. This is a useful app that will be a great help to me either traveling or at home. Good job, Weather Channel! :)
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Great gift my mom loved it! Best offer I could find :) I will be buy more frm u all
B000N2HBSO|4.0|This book is interesting because it revealed history I had never heard before reading this book.  Words required for submission.
0425263908|4.0|needed something worth reading after fifty shades of grey and this book definatley fit the bill. you got to read it
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Loved the play. Loved the movie.  Bought this after recently seeing the broadway production. This is a definite for fans of the play
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I am studying to be an Early childhood teacher. Watching the babies grow probably the same way in terms of developmental domains, made me realized that culture( the way we live and our surrounding) plays a big part in how we see the world. If you are not a teacher you might not appreciate how the children's grow, only because in the movie there is no dialect.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|My sons have a blast listening to Tom Cat imitate their silly phrases. In fact, even my husband was caught playing with this game. It's cute.
0307887960|5.0|and the book.  It arrived very quickly and the diet itself is easy to follow, thanks to Dr Dukan.  It takes a wee bit of will power, but the weight definitely came off quickly and stayed off for me as I followed his recommendations to a T.
B000YHG72E|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies. I love that its clean enough for my kids to watch too.  A classic!
B008C20TDG|5.0|Best book I have read on Paleo, just enough science stuff to allow the reader to understand the impact their diet has on a hormonal level. Goes so far past the benefits of weight loss.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I honestly expected less when I wathced this movie.  Best Batman ever....loved the Scarecrow and the plot.  Renting the rest of the trilogy tonight!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Heartwarming. The interaction between the characters, made me laugh in some places and tear up in others.  Sandra Bullock in the role of &#34;mama&#34; was stellar casting. This movie gave me hope. There are really good people left in the world. Southern accent anyone? *grin* c'mone and awlright then. The rest of the cast were perfect in their roles as well. S.J. was such a cutie and the scene where they are in the truck singing rap cracked me up, Yeah Baby! Collins showed an adult role in a teen. &#34;he wanted a truck&#34; ? Dad said &#34;Michael thinks he's a redneck&#34;. I may be prejudiced a little but I was educated in Memphis Tn in both High School and College. &#34;what's it gonna take?&#34;
B009FZHYKU|5.0|How many stars would I give this? How many stars are in the sky?? I love it. So exciting and you never know what to expect will happy next, My favorite show.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|A self-contradictory mess of inconsistent character origins and agendas which managed to waste the extraordinary potential of this story. Its mediocrity has haunted me for weeks now; I wish that I had never seen it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|great acting; interesting story line; held my interest.  why do i need to add so much into to these reviews.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|What an amazing story.  I read this while on vacation in Belize.  I couldn't put it down.  Anyone that is a runner or can appreciate the benefits of running should read this.  I have read it 3 times now.  The great thing is that I read a lot of other books about running and runners and a lot of them either refer to this book, or some of the the people within the story.  This should be on every runners shelf.  I also bought the Kindle version so I can read parts over again on the train to work.  It is always an inspiration and sometimes I need a little extra push when the weather get's a bit nasty or life just gets real busy.  I truly is a great read!
B005HSL626|5.0|Nothing bad to say about it. I absolutely LOVE it, and would have even paid for it. I lost my phone that I used it on, so I am doing this from memory.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Never knew where it was going to lead, even when you think you had it figured out, it twisted!  A great exciting and yet disturbing read.
B003THHIEM|5.0|i've been meaning to watch this show for ages, and i finally have the time. I love it already. great stories and great characters.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Very interesting take on cultural expectations of introverts and extroverts.  Good solid research, but no conclusion, open to individual conclusions, which I appreciated.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|after installing, I was quite impressed with the screen format and the information.<br /><br />I could not change the city, state.<br /><br />Tried everything that I could, but no luck.<br /><br />Removed from my device.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|This movie felt like some thought went into it - something beyond jumping on the latest fad. Something like art and creativity.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the best Christmas movie.  I bought this a gift for my secret santa and she loved the quality of the video.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So far, so good.  I have more to learn but so far I like it.<br />I have not gotten bingo yet but looking forward to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think pinterest is the best! The app is amazing and I love that I can get the info from the pins I've made right from my phone.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I listen to this one over and over and fall in love with different songs each time :)  Her voice and lyrics are beautiful, haunting, creative, and unique.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love reading these books. After seeing the HBO show I was interested in the books. I haven't been able to put them down.
B009FO96ZC|2.0|Don't think this is one of McLaughlin's better efforts... Players sound disjointed... didn't care for the production values or song forms or themes...  sounded sloppy and undisciplined.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The Game of Thrones books are amazing and I love to read them. I can't put them down. They are a delight to read!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|This book was well done.  I recommend to those who enjoy historical romances and tactfully done wallflower tropes.  It is always always enjoyable to read about average people also finding love.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this series. I think it's a great read. I can't ever put it down! If you like dragons and kings and castles, you'll love this series.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I haven't seen a really good movie in quite a while..I've been wanting to see this since I saw the previews when it first came out so my husband and I rented it and we both loved it. Gary Oldman is my favorite actor and although he didn't have a very big role in this movie, he still was amazing as usual!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the size of the display. Great for a 70 year old. So far as calculations it's all I need
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Hilarious! Rented it one night after a long day, and I couldn't have ended the day laughing so much. Definitely worth every penny and more.
0634060384|3.0|A very well copied book, just not for me..the songs are too old for me to know. I was hoping to see Pop Tunes turned in Jazz or light jazz. This isn't it.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I rented this movie for my daughter and she loved it. she watched it maybe 3 times before the time expired. This would also be considered for a movie to purchase for the holiday season.
B00AH34AUQ|3.0|But nothing to write home about. word word word word word word word word word word word word and words
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was hilarious, I could have watch it over and over. This would be a great purchase to buy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i AM ADDICTED TO THIS SHOW ,LOVE THIS SHOW,IT IS MOST EXCELLENT, READY TO MOVE ONTO SEASON 4.MORE MORE MORE
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Simple fun funny creative easy yet entertaining all the way through. Love this game. Look out for the yeti zombie.
B000KIPT30|5.0|My father-in-law has lost most of his hearing and has difficulty watching TV.  His hearing aid has a bluetooth interface, so we had hooked it up to the TV, but the volume wasn't loud enough and we couldn't change the level.  That's where this guy comes in.  I bought it and a few 1/8 to 1/4 inch adapters.  We have it set at about 75% and he is happy with the volume.  The device looks to be of good quality and well built.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Ordered this movie on instant play, great playback. My daughter who is 7 greatly enjoyed this movie. I loved how Disney has evolved all of the princesses to not follow the old snow white stereotypes. Overall an enjoyable for my family.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|It was a good end to the series.  If you liked the other Dark Knight movies then you will like this one as well.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|had to return first one as it was defective, second works great very addicting , grand kids love it  may purchase others
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie put a new unexpected twist on the Civil War.  Lot's of  edge of your seat action.  Good movie.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I love hidden object games and have quite a few downloaded. However this game pretty much ducks! It starts out that you're looking for 3 or 4 objects. Then goes to 15. You're given quests to complete but you must be linked to facebook and have friends in order to play. I personally don't want to connect to facebook just to play a game. You cant.buy objects you need forbthe game whether with real money or with your game coins without the friends. Also you are limited where you can play if you refuse to download the graphics. Why weren't these graphics included with original download? I only downloaded it roughly one week ago. The games constantly charges me more energy than required to play a room. This means I run out faster. I get two turns before I have to put the game down for several hours to rebuild my energy. This is a blanant attempt to get players to spend coins and/or money as in real money for the coin refill. I have contacted the developers about why I keep getting charged more energy than a room is worth and of course I got some BS generic email response. Beautiful. Also I cant stand the.night search and I cant stand the maids broken English and horrible grammar. What exactly was the point of making the maid that way? This game is getting uninstalled. I shouldn't have to download more anything just to be able to play. I'm not spending real money to play and its not cool they rigged the game to try to force you into spending real money. The developers weren't as smart as they thought although I see some of you actually spend money on it... not too smart in my opinion...
1609611543|5.0|I just received this book...cant wait to read it. over the Christmas break,,,it is Full of info and helpful recipes...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A must read for those who have lost a loved one.  It also makes you not fear death as we approach our final years.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Downloaded this app and just wasn't very impressed with it.  Can do better just going to the youtube website and searching.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wonderful story with unexpected twists and turns; beautifully told with eloquent use of language.I love the book and have recommended it to others.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Matt C is always nice to watch.  There is no real story or even interesting joke here but if you like male abs and a tiny bit of nudity, you'll get to see some.
0201633612|5.0|The conent of the book is obvisouly classic, but I do want to complain the papers they use to print the book. They're really poor; whenever you highlight, the highlights pervade to other side of the page.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love reading DeMille books. I enjoy the the humor of John Corey. The plot kept me engrossed in the book.
B0060ANOXY|5.0|roger waters is the best!!!! three wishes is my fave off this album. my advice is to buy this album it is awesome
B003O86FMW|5.0|I purchased the Hunger Games trilogy for reading on my iPad.  I had not seen the movie; after seeing the previews, I couldn't understand what all the buzz was about.<br /><br />As is usually the case, the book is so much better that the big screen.  I flew through the first book and Catching Fire did not disappoint.  I read the entire series in a few days.<br /><br />WARNING...you will not be able to put it down!!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Having played the game, I figured I would try the book.  It was very interesting and kept me wanting to read constantly.  I really liked the background story and I thought the writing was really good.
0762777931|5.0|Kris Carr makes this book not only educational but a fun read. I would totally recommend this book! She makes going healthy FUN!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|What can i say about this,  it watchable over and over again, brilliant cast, brilliant acting,  in fact brilliant everything
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I saw a Facebook post from another author advertising this book release. I absolutely love that author and have liked everything she has recommended. Well this took my breath away.<br /><br />I can not remember ever being so wrapped up into the characters of a book. I felt their pain but I also felt their love. This is such a heartfelt story.<br /><br />This definitely makes my list of must reads!!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It made history come alive.  I couldn't put it down.  His characters were so believeable, they drew you into the conflicts.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|My family's ALL time favorite Christmas movie! So Funny!  I would recommend this movie to EVERYONE!  Will Ferrell is Hillarious!
0345441184|5.0|I did order it thinking it was new, but it was in fact used, I don't really mind though, if anything the dust sleeve was slightly yellowed but it's still in great condition. I love this book so much, and so I wanted to give it to somebody for Christmas. Worked out well, and it was delivered much faster than estimated.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun,  I must thank my friend for suggesting I try it. Also my six year old grand daugther says its a real blast.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is truly addictive. I find myself so wrapped up in playing it that I lose all track of time.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A good story, a little far fetched but just what you want in a work of fiction. Corey's smartass attitude got a wee bit tiring. But that his character. In all a good read
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I was a fan of Sing Off when it was on the air and had heard Pentatonix was coming out with a Christmas &#34;album&#34; so was interested.  PTXmas did not disappoint.  With only 5 voices it is amazing the complexity and depth of the sound they achieve.  And the innovative arrangements are what they are know for and another one of the things I love about Pentatonix.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is so wel written that I felt like I was on the trail with her.  I loved it so much that I am bought two for Christmas presents.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Haven't listened to it yet - but looks good ! it's an used item, but it looks like i never has been played.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|how to get  your kids caught up on your childhood. And this one is from john hughes, a classmate at my high school.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this album. I'm not a die hard Ke$ha fan, but I did like Cannibal. This album is so much better! Every song is different from the others and I love the use of actual instruments. It is not all dance songs. I've listened to the album about 3 times now and I love it more with every listen. This is raw Ke$ha unleashed. The deluxe edition is definitely worth the extra money.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Guess your never too old for Teddy bears!!!  This movie was far better than I could have imagined.  So funny.  Laughed from beginning to end.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I bought this album because I loved the single, Locked out of Heaven. I can say that I am thoroughly pleased with it. I did, however, buy the deluxe edition from another retailer. If I could buy it over again, I wouldn't have spent the extra money and would have just purchased it from Amazon. The songs on the are very catchy. Bruno doesn't stick to just one genre, hence the album title. His voice is absolutely incredible and fun to listen to. This was my first Bruno Mars purchase and it has made me consider looking into his other albums as well. Two thumbs up!
B000QUCNXG|4.0|Very interesting study of personalities; left the reader reaching their own conclusions about the ending.  I would recommend the book.
B0027BVMSY|3.0|I love Daniel Craig as James Bond, and the opening chase scene is AWESOME.  However, it kinda falls off after a bit.  It was nice to watch it before going to see Skyfall in the theater.
B000I3W1XS|3.0|This movie is an integral part of the series of movies, but it could have had more depth.  Still, I enjoyed it.
B009VB97EY|1.0|thin story, characters were not engaging at all. What was the well known director doing taking up this empty and unsatisfying story? The characters were entirely predictable. Useless waste of money and flim.
B0098VXCR0|4.0|This is a good, entertaining adaptation of the children's story.  It's all grown up now with action and suspense.  It borrows some references to the original fairy tale, but is its own story on its own too.  Nice job.  Not for the little kiddies (especially when one of the dwarves is killed!), but adults will like it.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|We watched this classic during the holiday season. It was warm, witty and it sent a simple message appropriate for this season. Beautifully photographed, the charming 'minor' characters, the gentle story all created a satisfying movie viewing experience. So nice to not have pyrotechnics, cgi effects, etc that bloat today's movies. The writers knew how to tell a story and told it well.
B005ONTD42|2.0|If you thought \\"I Robot\\" was the greatest movie ever made and totally lived up to the hype, then you will love Sphero. Sphero is an awesomely advertised, brilliantly implemented little R/C toy that provides $50 of fun for only $150 out of pocket!<br /><br />To be clear, as a former engineer, I am exceedingly impressed with the amount of work that clearly went into the implementation of this device. The problem is that these brilliant engineers appear to have solved a non-existant problem to create a device that provides limited entertainment value: as other reviewers have pointed out, there are no decent apps for Sphero (to use Sphero as a game controller) and the control apps are fairly limited as well. Sure, you can spend 30 minutes driving Sphero around the house before you get bored and/or frustrated, but then you're kinda done.<br /><br />Unlike an R/C car with actual wheels (or a helicopter that flies), Sphero has a great deal of trouble transitioning over even modest floor-carpet interfaces. If you have a throw rug in your living room, then you have a new game you get to play with Sphero: how many times do you need to ram Sphero into the side of the carpet before it will make it instead of getting stuck on the edge, vibrating sadly?<br /><br />Need to stop suddenly or make a really sharp turn? Not with Sphero. Controlling Sphero is an excellent exercise in learning about momentum, and if that's something you're interested in, then by all means, please buy. I, however, wanted something to simply relax with in the evening or after lunch. In the same way that I will personally never again purchase an R/C helicopter without a gyroscopic stabilizer (if you really want a lesson in physics, go for that -- I still have a few pieces left from mine in a box somewhere), Sphero is not for those looking for a simple R/C toy that \\"just works\\".<br /><br />All-in-all, this Robotic Ball ends up being a $150 toy that does very little for the cost. I ended up returning mine to get a $25 R/C helicopter and $125 of Cheezypoofs.get a $25 R/C helicopter and $125 of Cheezypoofs.
B009Y2KGSQ|4.0|I was really surorised by this latest offering from Aerosmith.  I had low expectations and this turned out to be a great listen.  It is a greast combination of old sound with more recent sound.  The band sounded tight and Steven Tyler sounded really hitting the mark.
B0046XMTZG|3.0|Loved the comic so I thought I'd check it out. It's worth watching once but it's mediocre. Feels like a remake of Wild Wild West.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|Delightful performances from a powerful cast.  Guys will squirm in their chairs watching Jones react to the various challenges presented him.  The movie serves as a wakeup call for couples with a stagnant relationships after more than 30 years of marriage.  I have already recommended it to several of my friends.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Well written exploration of an interesting concept.  The idea of space exploration using experienced humans opens up entirely new approaches to storytelling.  Will look forward to reading more of these stories.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Look, you know what you're in for if you're already watching Season 3. There are some good shockers and plot twists. There are still the same problems with the thin characterization of women and apparently the writers think that you can't have more than one viable black character at a time. However, watching everyone deal with their internal issues is really compelling and the main characters do grow in ways that make them more believable. I have to say that the best characters are the redneck brothers - Merle and Dale...I mean, who knew that rednecks would be the ones with all the necessary survival skills to make it in the zombie apocalypse??
B0058YPL66|5.0|Snow White, Prince Charming, the wicked queen, Rumpelstiltskin, Cinderella, trolls; something to please everyone. However, I  hope they don't allow the series to turn into soap opera.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Very interesting concept for a new show.  May download rest of the first season since I don't get this on my cable plan.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Delightful, gentle, and charming film with so many wonderful British stars! How could one not like a film with Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Celia Imrie, Penelope Wilton, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy!
B000MRA5NS|5.0|This was a great reboot of the bond franchise.  Many of the 80's and 90's versions were kind of bland, no real teeth to them and not very entertaining.  This was gritty, but still sophisticated, what you expect from a Bond film.  Really enjoyed Daniel Craig in the role.  Not a perfect movie by any stretch, but certainly enjoyable.
B008602KQI|5.0|A movie everyone should see.  Action packed and very likeable characters.  I give this 5 stars and would see it again and again.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Wicked funny.  Great story, and wonderful resolution in HD.  I would definitely recommend this movie to all Macfarlane fans.  Makes me think of what Stewie would be like when he grows up.
B009KCUX3S|5.0|Fantastic book, perfect way to explain material (in pictures)<br /><br />Highly recommended to everyone, who is going to start learning his first programming language....intresting to read, easy to learn and you will get a fantastic result.<br /><br />Best guide book ever for me.
B003B02O7I|4.0|Was very good, but slow starting, once it got going it held my interest through the end. I would recommend it.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Bosch at his best. Couldn't put it down. I need 10 more words to describe what I like about this book. m<br />Get It !!!<br />Joe W
B0083EW97W|3.0|John is VERY talented, but this is not his best work. It seems experimental. Hopefully he will be back to form on his next album.
B00004YRQA|1.0|Thoroughly disappointed. I bought a PS2 for my boyfriend, as I already have one for myself. When I put my memory card into his PS2, Kingdom Hearts 2 reads it, but when I insert this one in, the game does not read it. Won't be buying another memory card from Amazon again.
B006LSZECO|2.0|What a waste!  I was really hooked until about the middle of the book. I had to force myself to finish.  And then, the ending, what can I say?
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I found myself unable to put this down.<br />I thought the characters were great and well developed. A great read all around.
B00170DEM8|2.0|My wife and I wanted to watch a holiday themed movie that was good, clean, and fun.  We had seen the talents of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire before, so we decided to rent Holiday Inn.  The movie had a thin plot line and gags which were not funny.  The singing and dancing talent was amazing, but not enough to carry the movie.  We stopped watching half way through.  If you want to get a glimpse into what was considered entertainment back in the '40's, this movie is an example.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Again, another story about teenage angst by this author.  I enjoy this author and have read numerous books by her.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Must watch season one first, but this series is awesome. Surprise endings and suspense! Buy the whole packaage and save yourself money
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|What a wonderful independent film with a great original music score.  Glen and Marketa are naturals on the screen, and I would highly recommend this film.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|The Bourne Legacy is a heart pounder.  I saw it twice already.  It's as good as the other Bourne movies!
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I give this the highest rating due to it's vivid, shocking but accurate portrayal of the times. I would recomend this for any adult who enjoys historical dramas who is not faint of heart!
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I really like michael Buble on CD's, but can't stand him live or on video.  He has too much nerves energy and looks jerky on stage not smooth like the great male singers.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry just gets better with age.  Hope Connelly keeps him going. Looking forward to the next edition with this character.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book so much! From the moment I started reading, I fell in love with the two main characters, Clary and Jace. I recommend this book to everyone, as well as the rest of the series!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book.  It was a fast, riveting page turner.  I would recommend it to anyone, male or female.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read! Especially great for romance and action lovers, this book as well as the rest of the series is one of my favorites! Its a great sequel to City of Bones, and well worth the read. It will leave you wanting more, and its good that there are five books in the series and a sixth on the way!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I Love the solitaire game, butI find itthe extremely frustrating because I can't figureout how to top all the pop up ads in between games?can anyone tell me how to do this?
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this is such a great game u should get it if u don't have it yet fin fin fun fun fun
B000SW4DXK|5.0|It's nice to see good, positive movies with the &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending in a time when we see so much bad, negative!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Had streaming problems only once and I'm not sure who's end it was on. I need 6 more words to submit this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow - are there any other words to describe this?  Couldn't put it down - and didn't have to since it was downloaded on my Kindle!!
0062202081|5.0|Gave this a 5 stars because it came really fast, I was surprised. and most importantly this product is amazing. i love it&#60;3
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I'm not a big fan of any of the so called social networks but then<br />I grew up 2 or 3 generations ago when Jimi Hendricks and Janis<br />Joplin were still alive and would rather talk than text.It seems<br />that if people have 2 comon cents to rub together they'd be<br />dangerous.Why does it seem like stupid and lack of privacy<br />go so well together.I quit the Facebook for that reason and<br />this thing is there only by a thread.I guess it just feels so good<br />to have their moment of celebracy
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I think this story is powerful and relevant. It takes beliefs I've always held and expands them even further. Truly a beautiful and thought provoking book. I think it would make a good book club book to share and talk about the ideas held here.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I loved Tim Ferriss's life style and his first two books were very enjoyable.<br /><br />This one is in a very similar style. Two things that I don't like about this book compared to 4 hour work week and 4 hour body is that it seems more randomly organized and it left out some important things that I was expecting. ( things like advice on provigil usage )
B005XE33FM|5.0|Best album ever! And I love how thick the record is! Chris Cornell is the best singer I. The world!
B008JAGTNK|3.0|I was anxious to see another Kenneth Lonergan film given my rabid appreciation for his first film, &#34;You Can Count on Me&#34;. &#34;Margaret&#34; doesn't quite meet the bar set so high by his earlier work. It ran a little long, moved a little aimlessly and didn't quite pay as deep an emotional dividend.<br /><br />But it wasn't horrible.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This album, like the ones before, provides exactly the type of passion and sincerity that we have come to expect from Mumford & Sons. The lyrics are sometimes less than concrete, allowing the music and passion to speak for itself and touch the hearts of listeners from a diverse variety of contexts.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I must say this show never dissappoints. I am stuck in front of the tv the duration of the show. I recommend this show to any and everyone : )
B009HELT3C|3.0|Josh Brolin was great as a young Tommy Lee Jones. But the movie was over done with unnecessary special effects, they should have focused on the storyline a little better.
0393343405|5.0|The reason I read history is not to get an encyclopedic knowledge of past events, but to stumble upon some narrative that makes sense of the events I know. Greenblatt, whose Shakespeare book is also worth buying, is a master at creating such a narrative. What we call the Enlightenment was no doubt inevitable, but the way it  happened owed its actual trajectory to the rescue of a disintegrating manuscript of the first century BCE poet Lucretius. Among the cascade of events following that happenstance may be the addition of &#34;the pursuit of happiness&#34; to the American Declaration of Independence, for Thomas Jefferson had a number of editions of Lucretius in his library and under his influence, called himself an Epicurean: hence &#34;the pursuit of happiness&#34; rather than Locke's &#34;life, liberty and property.&#34; Now that's history a layman can love!
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I have seen this movie many years ago and loved it, when my wife was looking for a fun movie to watch, I got her this one and she enjoyed watching it too.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I would change the title of the book. I almost didn't buy it because of the title. After I read some reviews I found out that it wasn't really about being a chef. Of course, Tim weaves some interesting things into the book about being a chef. The book is very long, but I jumped around and read the parts I was interested in first. You don't have to read it front to back. Bottom line: I would highly recommend the book.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|great go to when you just want to do a quick perusal of a bunch of sources.  then only thing i can think of THAT would make this perfect is the ability to read subscribed to sources; such as Wired magazine.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not even a science fiction fan for the most part and I only read this book due to the overwhelming reviews. Turns out they were dead-on. Highly recommended book(s)!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Real simple. If you enjoy quality in all elements of production, realistic enough not to be offended by language, political views or gritty sex; then this is your show. It's a complex world and we rarely have the opportunity to be exposed to real character development in our entertainment offerings.<br />I actually may watch this more than once just to see the character development evolve. Bottom line it is well worth the money and time.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I bought this on the recommendation of my cousin.  I wish I had listened to my own instincts and saved the money.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Adele is simply an amazing young Singer. I recommend this album to anyone who  truly appreciates real quality music listening.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|The Social Network gives viewers a sense of what it is like to be around genius.  I do not use the term \\"genius\\" lightly; whether or not people like Facebook is not the issue; rather, my review focuses on the creation of the idea...how anyone, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc... gets an idea and runs with it.  Millions of people have ideas, but most are not able to implement their imagination.  This film gives the public a window into Harvard, the students who attend that institution, how an idea is germinated, and finally, how what seems to be a simple idea is turned into a multi-billion dollar company.  The Big Three (listed above) did not actually graduate from college, not counting honorary degrees; however, who cares?  The products these people invented have changed all of our lives; we use computers in every facet of life... and we rarely think of Gates, Jobs, or Zuckerberg while using their imagination.<br /><br />A remarkable and stunning portrayal of genius in the making.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and addicting game. I love puzzle games, this one is one of my favorites so far. The 10x10 can be challenging at times, I'm excited for the 14x14.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love all the Dark Night movies.  You just can't go wrong with the story line and to have them all in one packet with extras is great!
B007C7UZIG|5.0|It help me see who online or not and the list I can see to compare. Also to see if the list is active game for sale
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show always has you on the edge with survival and conspiracy.  Not gov't conspiracy but more like survival conspiracy which is harder to imagine and create a plot for.  GREAT SHOW!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome book....stayed up very late night after night reading.  Incredible!!  This book kept me wanting more.  All three books were outstanding!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Awesome soundtrack! I liked the music it was very melodius I especially liked the dwarves because they had cool beards
B006CQLGXG|5.0|It was great helped us out a lot when my son left his paper back copy at school and needed it to refernce his home work that night.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of his best books and would make a great movie. Plot was intriguing which kept me turning pages as quick as i could.
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this for myself but catch my grandsons enjoying it too.<br />The hero is a rogue, the princess is strong, with attitude.<br />modern values
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Ok book. Not too bad but kind of strange. tough to explain. It was just an ok book i guess.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Buy one for each of your family.<br />This is a great movie with family values and virtues worth emulating.<br />Hard to believe people were like this, unless you were there.<br />Heart warming, funny,
0425263916|5.0|Couldn't put it down...Can't wait til the next book comes out. Gave recommendations to a few friends & family members to read as well. They all loved it!
B000T433CO|4.0|I purchased as a gift because I liked it well enough to do so.<br />It is decidedly &#34;chick flick&#34;  Hooray!
B0015UKX7E|4.0|I saw Prince in concert several months and can't stop thinking about how great a Performer he is.  I've watched this DVD many times...it's great!
B0013527I4|5.0|purchased as a gift last Christmas for my son in law who is a collector.<br />I think he stashed it away in his treasure chest.
B001NLN07K|3.0|This DVD....not so much.  The storyline was too predictable and the acting wasn't good.<br /><br />Which is very surprising for a Michael Mann movie.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Great Disney entertainment.  Sad that the toys have to find a new home.<br />My 85 yr old grandmother wanted a copy so I bought this for her.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|While the violence of the book pride & prejudice and zombies was a bit much, the humor, wit, excellent writing in the phraseology and sentence structure of original P&P made it a delicious guilty pleasure.Unfortunately P.D. James version had none of the above. So flat, so boring it felt like a bad star trek fan fiction in which the author relies on the reader to imagine the characters and paint in the color, flavor, tone and dialogue. P.D James's books usually have settings and characters that are so alive and vibrant. It seemed more gothic, moody and ominous than I have ever read in Jane Austin. ouch...It is not easy to be so harsh, especially since I really enjoyed P.D. James's Children of Men which was also quite a step away from her usual genre of british murder mysteries.<br />Part of me wonders if it was not P&P I would not be so critical (since there were a few Jane Austin movies I have walked out of since director had different view point than me.)<br />I am guessing if this was a book with Dickens characters I would not be so emotionally invested or disappointed. Thankfully I have many enjoyable P.D James books I can re-read to buck my spirits.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This cloud storage is very helpful in keeping everything synced. Works behind the scenes. I would recommend for everyone to use.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|Seth MacFarlane shows that he can be funny and romantic. The movie is about a foul mouth teddy bear with the voice of Peter Griffin, so if you love Family guy, you've come to the right place, it also has a bit of romance in it. Mark Wahlberg needed to be in this, cause its set in Boston, and he is in most Boston based movies.
B0063GORYU|3.0|The game is fine. The device on which it's played flips back to ads between each game.  That's time consuming<br />and unpleasant for a purchased game.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|i thought story wise waaaaaay better then RIses. i just really love the movie. The insanity of the Joker makes the movie great, well played traps and great acting all around (even christian bale, i know right?). just an around great movie if you're a batman fan, and even if your not.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|Only the begining and last 10-15 minutes of the movie had the Master Chief,sniff.  That alone was<br />worth the price of admission.  It would have been nicer if they went right in to battle and Master Cheif was training the cadets in actual combat.<br />(And give The Master Chief more one liners.)
B002BI6SMI|1.0|I love the movie taken. However I wasn't able to watch it because it kept stopping or it would stop and go back it the main menu.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a great game to pass time and challenging enough to stay interesting. Love to hunt for all the bonuses.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Book held my interest. reminded me of some of the Harry<br />Bosch novels, but not quite as intense. Some of the court sessions got a little long.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is a cute game and it is lots of fun to play. I like the graphics as well. It is fun to choose pets and take care of them on this game.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Just like the original Atari, you have to BUY all but one game.  The game you get is not my favorite.  It is actually my least favorite.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Was a very funny movie with a cute storyline.  This movie is great for any group of friends to watch.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Will has always been a good character, this movie shows what a good actor he really is.<br /><br />Most anything he's in is gonna be a good movie!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has been very handy for me to upload documents that I have scanned. Makes them always accessibile on any of my devices
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|this album by T.I. really reminded me of Trap Muzik but still was modern and up to date though. T.I. takes us back and remides us why is he the King of the South
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Works really well so far!  Well worth the price for the extra flexibility! I would highly recommend this APP for all those that have the need for this capability.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The language that has been allowed to be viewed in the message area has been deplorable, and takes away from the enjoyment of playing the game, blocked that out, the game is not very reactive on the Kindle.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|When I first watched the tudors I could not understand the casting.  By the end I concluded that the casting director was a genius.  JRM and the tudors take you from your couch to the intrigues and horrors of 1500s England.  Wonderful dialogue, terrific acting and beautiful costumes command attention.  The actors transcend themselves to take on their persona.  Cromwell and JRM are outstanding.<br /><br />You will become more interested in English history.  You can watch over and over.  I watched when we had Netflix and bought DVDs to rewatch.<br /><br />This is for very mature audiences only as there is significant nudity and sexual content.  It is very off putting in the first season but lessons dramatically afterwords.  Fast forward is my friend.  To any producers----save some money and leave that to imagination.  Best scenes are with Cromwell, More, Fisher and JRM all with clothes on!<br /><br />Only negatives are you will watch multiple episodes in a sitting and stay up too late.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I got this as a replacement cord from the original that came with my kindle 3 years ago. The original cord's plastic covering was crumbling and falling off exposing wires. The replacement seems ok so far.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|These are plastic uno cards.  They are wettable, washable and take a beating.  Small children can play and one does not need to worry about them folding, chewing or otherwise ruining cards.  (They are not scissor proof so cannot say indestructible but very close.)<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Ordered the movies and they are exactly as expected. Besides adding a personal thought about the movies, i'm not really sure what else to say. Nice packaging?
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|The rider and elephant is a good comparison to the emotions and the common sense person.  The description of a clear goal and how to achieve it is great.  I do feel, especially here at Christmas, froozen by too many choices.  It helps you figure out how to unfreeze yourself and make progress daily.
B0089OBLDO|5.0|Great 3 in 1 tool for any gamer. Allows for the excuse &#34;oh I can't play because of the controller to be a thing of the past.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was completely overtaken by this novel. The author's descriptions of the different parts of the magic competition let your imagination run wild with vivid detail. I have recommended this book to several people and they all have loved it.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|We bought this app for our daughter and she can't stop playing.  She loves the different songs and has different opportunities to play all types of music.  Great App!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|The Christmas Carol by C. Dickens has become a traditional read at Christmas time for me in the past few years. The story really embodies what the Christmas season is all about, and if you're going into the season feeling stressed and &#34;Humbugged&#34;, then this story will elevate your &#34;spirits&#34;, no pun intended.  I think it would be a great tradition to start each year with your children or grandchildren.  I highly recommend this book.
B000006YXV|5.0|This one has all of the good songs on it.  Buying this cd used was cheaper than buying a few of his songs on iTunes.  Great album.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The colors are very vibrant on the blu ray. Definitely worth the money to get the DVD, blu ray, and digital copy. Now we can watch it in any room.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Worth reading just to get you thinking about the value of a life. I read this not long after viewing the movie &#34;The Intouchables&#34; which has a similar theme but a totally different focus and outcome. This novel provided some good food for thought on the subject of euthanasia and people's rights. It manages to do this in a light style with characters that will appeal for different reasons. This provides a few different perspectives on the issues. I recommend this book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Book was great!!  Harry was in his usual rare form!! Getting into trouble with top brass without much effort!! Solving a 20 year old murder.. Gotta love Harry. Everyone counts, or no one counts...
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I bought it for my son but in this moment I'm still reading it and I like it.<br />English is not my language and it is easy to read without s lot interruptions with the dictionary.<br />I only wonder how far Riordan can go with these demigods story.
6304401736|3.0|The product plays well, though the tape was cracked and the box was squashed. Probably caused during the transit process.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Maybe my expectations are too hi, but there weren't as many laughs as I was hoping for.  I'm a Macfarlane fan and there were great reviews on this, but it fell short for me.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Great read. I really enjoyed the book. Its pretty content heavy!<br /><br />From my perspective, Cooking isnt as daunting as Tim found it. I think the real value in the book comes from the &#34;how to learn anything&#34; overview.<br />Being able to de construct and learn anything simply and quickly pays off across the board in life.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Team of Rival is well written and researched to my knowledge. Very readable in the sense it isn't academic.I highly recc it to anyone interested in this seminal figure in our history as a nation.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is a game similar to Tiny Monsters, its just Tiny Monsters is a cash hoard. In Dragon story, you can either buy anything or breed and earn it! There are millions of dragons to collect and you can visit peoples islands! At least try this game!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the lower levels are great for little kids while the higher levels offer even adults a hard challenge! great app
B008J05EL8|1.0|I downloaded this app because  my kindle recommended it. after I spent the money<br /> downloading it the app never even worked! it's a waste of an app because the app I already paid for should come with fonts and then the thing didn't even work-! I want money back!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|got this for my 6yr old, but my 15 yr old took it over!  (shhh.. my 10 yr old boy played too!)
B004SDEP38|1.0|when I signed  up for this app it did not inform me that in order to get the full use out of it I had to purchase it for $14.95.
098555780X|3.0|I was rather disappointed in this purchase since nearly all the knots are covered in any basic macramé instruction, or if not, you can find them in Ashley's Book of Knots. Personally, I have found paracord a less-than-pleasant medium despite the fact that it comes in a wide selection of colors. I won't say this purchase was entirely money down the drain, but it definitely converts to a high cost-per-project ratio because I don't enjoy this version of the craft.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I love complex harmony, I love a capella, and I love the way Pentatonix takes on these familiar old songs and OWNS them!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Michael Caine is utterly brilliant as Ebenezer Scrooge (a fact which should come as a surprise to no one)and when played against Kermit's humble Bob Cratchit, the effect of his conversion to benefactor is more touching and heart-warming than any fully human cast could achieve. The real surprise, however, comes in Miss Piggy's portrayal of Emily Cratchit. For once, our beloved Piggy gets to demonstrate her true talent as an actress, suppressing her famous temper in all but one brief flareup directed at Scrooge. If you're going to watch one Christmas movie, this should be it!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Good movie. Has Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg. Action packed, has a climax. Eighteen words is the minimum.  Look. Platypus.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Great acting and fun story. They definitely completed the picture of the relationship of the two main characters.  I would watch it again
0007350031|4.0|Book was in excellent condition and arrived when they said it would. I appreciated the cover being in fine condition and the illustrations/ graphics the paper backs do not have,
B004OC07F8|4.0|I have wanted to build a new business that has very strong customer focus for years. This book walks you through the process. Combine this with Lean Startup methodology and you will know sooner than later if you have a winner. It's well worth the investment.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Best book I've read in awhile.  Thought provoking and uplifting, I am still pondering some inner questions.  Saw the movie after the book and it followed it pretty well although I am glad to have read the book first.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This years second season actually trumps last years premier season - Jessica Lang is fantastic as is the entire cast. The show has spectacular production values, superb perfomrances abound and enough twists, turns an secondary story lines to keep you guessing and glued to the show. And the best part is no commercials whatsoever! The HD is flawless as is the sound. As for the streaming - ZERO buffering and the show loads immediatley. Just a fun, creepy and compelling show that's both well concieved, well written and abounds with a dark and delicous spooky atmosphere
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is so helpful! I am in the process of publishing my book on Kindle and really need a user-friendly guide to walk me through it. I couldn't do it without this! Thank you! Highly recommend to other authors out there!
B005SZAEYO|5.0|American Horror Story is smart, well written an well concieved. Geniune scares abound in this dark, haunted and wonderfully produced series. Performences are excellent all the way around and I've enjoyed seeing it again just as much as the first time. Full of sinister sub plots and unexpected twists it's freakishly fun.<br /><br />It's always a pleasure to see Frances Conroy she's a terrific actress and I loved her in Six Feet Under, her role here of course is quite different. The entire cast is superb as is the overall production value. We're \\"grave\\" dep into the new season which is just as well done - and it's great to see so many of the old cast members back for a second go.<br /><br />Streaming via Roku is effortless and the HD is brilliant, clear and pristine as is the sound even from you TV speakers. There's no buffering and better yet NO commercials. This is a terrific show for any horror fan, and even if you're not you're sure to get a kick out of it.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|Great movie for a laugh for all ages. Watched with my highschool age kids and we were all laughing. Glad I added this to my video library.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I personally am a Jeremy Renner fan, so that helps I'm sure. Otherwise, this was a decent Bourne flick, I do recommend watching at least the previous film first, as there is a lot of references and time-line cross-over to the last film. The stories seem to run somewhat parallel - Jeremy Renners character is also evading the CIA hit squads that are trying to take down Bourne.<br /><br />Hardcore Bourne fans may be a tad disappointed, but I was not. I own the preceding films on Blu-Ray, I will add this one to that collection.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|Five stars and I don't even like halo. :) Now I feel like playing all the games. Go watch it now.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|As always with G5 games, this is great fun! Plus the video and fixed graphics are better than ever<br />Regarding the fees, the game description does say that the game has a feature that uses real money. Albiet it isn't clear what those fees are. Personally., I like playing the free game intro. This allows me to check out the game before paying. So if I don't like it, I've not lost any money. I would prefer that once I've paid for the game I wouldn't have to go through the extra steps when I replay it.<br />Keep up the great work G5!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|VERY GOOD STORY, SO I LOVED THE MOVIE. THE STARS WERE JUST PERFECT FOR THE PARTS THEY PLAYED.GREAT SHOW. THANKS
B008NMT684|3.0|My kids really love this product, however, the free version is not very robust.<br />I think I may break down and buy the upgrade though.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This is a great movie to watch and it also has a value message.  I would recommend it to anyone to watch.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great scope.  Strong plot.  Well developed characters.<br />The story took you where you hoped it would go.<br />Very well done
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Very strange movie - the acting was great but other than that it isn't worth the money.  Left me wondering why I spent all that precious time watching it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This was the best of the Harry Bosch series so far.  But then I say that about each one!  It has some great details about the riots of 1992 (I was there) and his handling of the 'time' aspect of story telling is excellent.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This was action packed all the way and I loved Renner in that role.  He is going to become a super star.  The storyline was good and kept me interested the whole time - didn't want it to end but the way it did end signaled a sequel.  Very glad about that.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|A quick worthwhile read...interesting main character that you might not always approve of...slight twist to the timeline in plot revelation
B0076DELIG|5.0|Best Harry Bosch novel yet!!! I see a future where Harry retires and his daughter takes over as the series lead character.
B007R41E8O|5.0|i like this game because at the end he turns in to some kind of monster and then the woman stabs him
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love this movie dearly.<br /><br />I love Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Iron Man. I think that each iteration of Tony Stark in the latest Marvel movies have been perfect. I was also a fan of the other characters in the movie. As a guy, I am obviously in love with Scarlett Johannsen.<br /><br />The story starts off with the attack of a super secret military headquarters and never stops building steam from there. Some of the most memorable moments in this movie (and pretty much anything that Joss Whedon has ever but his stamp on) came from the dialogue.<br /><br />At one point, Captain America asks Tony Stark, \\"Without the suit, what would you even be?\\" Tony replies, \\"Uhh...a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist?\\"<br /><br />Another moment you hear Robert Downey Jr call the antagonist's weapon a 'glowstick of destiny'. It is Marvel. It's The Avengers. It's also been perfectly 'Whedon-ized'.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it by now, chances are you are unhappy or living without any form of technology.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show on TV!!! I look forward to taking a break from my homework every week to watch it.
1409375978|5.0|Some Character Encyclopedias are hard to find and this one was worth waiting for.  My grandson requested it.  Just what he wanted.  Great buy.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Gives a different perspective on Lincoln, a great storyline and awesome action scenes, the ending brings the viewer back to reality.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|..which is stupid.  I foolishly thought kindle books were kindle books.  Now I like all my kindle's a little less.
B007T99ENE|5.0|one of the few books I would really  recomend- he gets better with every book -  this is more like his early work
B00328R21C|5.0|This item arrived in time and is just what my kid wanted from christmas. I hope he'll enjoy it. Thanks
B006LSZECO|3.0|The members of my book group and I did not like this book. We liked the poetry with the clues and an occasional good phrase but did not enjoy the story. However it made for a good discussion regarding Nick's weaknesses and Amy's psychotic behavior. We also decided that we did not have much regard for her parents who as psychologists should have done a better job with her.
0316228532|4.0|It starts out slow and I wonder in what direction it will go.<br />I am reading chapter 9 right now....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Pure entertainment! Interesting to see how even in an apocalyptic zombie world both good and evil remain among the living.
1579128955|5.0|My kids love this book. This is a must for young inquisitive minds. I really appreciate the way the author has embedded information for various expertise levels. For examples: For young kids - lots of colorful pictures and easy readability. For the expert - there is also the electron orbital configurations.
B0058W74UY|2.0|It does not work as a replacement for Adobe Flash Player for Android. This player did not stream video from the web. It was a complete disappointment and a waste of time.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|At first glance the Kindle app looks like the Android one, but the feed available goes back only two hours! Inadequate!
B008CIUS72|2.0|I bought this player because Adobe Flash Player for Android has been discontinued. It does not work as a substitute for the Adobe product. Don't get this if your goal is to replace Adobe Flash Player---you will be disappointed.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Fun drawing on the bigger screen, but without \\"bonus\\" words, badges, and color store, it seems incomplete. Also, app crashes when opponent guesses an extra coins drawing. Boo. Finish it, please!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|The main reason I downloaded Avast Security Mobile is because I use Avast on my windows 7 laptop and it's been great in stopping all threats to my computer. Also the built in firewall for mobile is great, I can stop permission from allowing to have access to my phone through Wifi, 3g, etc. I installed angry birds, and chess games and the sort that ask for permission that are private and with Avast I can stop them through the firewall :-) Some apps, I really like and I think it's a waist of time and effort to remove them because I can't get rid of there privacy issues against my phone but with Avast I can control what they see. Thank you Avast for your complete protection, I'm a great fan of yours :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book's amazing and purely awesome. The book took my breath away. I can't wait to read the next two
B007PVHMCG|1.0|I thought this was a large lego set as it was priced at $129.00.  It's smaller than a small kleenex box.  When I read reviews, most customers paid between $30 - $40 dollars for this item.  Either Amazon has made a mistake in pricing or they are ripping people off because it is the holiday.  I'll return it but end up losing $30.00 for the expidited shipping.  This is about enough for me to stop shopping amazon
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A decent game.  Fun and Variety.  Haven't upgraded yet but will seriously consider it.<br />Better music would be a plus.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Not a huge fan of the Batman series but this one  -- well one of the better ones if not the best.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Although the plot is a lot like the show, Homeland, I found it as gripping as all of De Mille's books.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|soap(guy pearce) is an uber cool character(that plays on such gems as \\"the count of monte cristo\\",& \\"the hurt locker\\")he's an over the top action junkie with a radiant wit(if u're into action,or comedy[,or both in my case]u'll b pleased).
B007FEFLTO|2.0|The trite contrivance of having a character present at every significant event in history is annoying. A family in a boat in Pearl Harbor during the attack, another present at the Oswald Mosley riot. Enough already.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|A must see. In my top 50 of the best  movies made! Fasinating ture story of Frank Serpico. Al Pacino at his best.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Interesting premise, and lots of sly digs at the beaurocracy.  Kept me going, just to see how things would turn out
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Hi hi j jddjjdjdjduw hi jdjudusussuueejd see suggests huge when he's joined together yesterday holidays brings joy and robbing the first time since
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Very repetitive.  Author really couldn't explain, at least not in earthly terms.  Would be more convincing if done in a shorter version.  Too much clinical detail about his illness
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids love this application, it is great for their reflex and they enjoy palying this great game. Awsome game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What ever possessed the publisher to print this trash? Nasty premise, extremely poorly written (as far as I could tell -- i quickly put it down..)
B0086700CM|5.0|Again my kids love to play with this application, they use a lot of their reflex, I reccomend it to anyone.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book reads like a romance novel. I don't know what possessed to think I might like it. Lots of sex though if you need sex instructions!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Both my wife and I thought that casting a female Dr. Watson was a stunt, but Lucy Lui actually adds an interesting aspect to the oft told tales of Holmes. Jonny Lee Miller is a fine Holmes. Supporting cast is very good.
B009INAKM8|5.0|This review is about the new Tenth Anniversary Edition of the album, not just a re-hash review of the original TOTBL album released back in 2002.<br /><br />Got this album off Amazon and am very pleased with it so far. The album contains 2 CDs and a DVD..... 1st CD is the original TOTBL album, completely re-mastered. It sounds incredible! 2nd CD is a disc of various demo takes of several songs, previously unreleased songs, etc. My favorites off this one, besides Specialist (which appears to be the same one from the 2002 EP), are Interlude and Get The Girls/Song 5, and also Precipitate. The DVD contains either full concerts or snippets of songs from 2 different concerts. First concert from 2000 is with (still current) drummer Sam Fogarino in NYC. It is significant because it was Sam's FIRST show with the band, performed only a month after joining. The second concert is from 2002 at the Troubadour in L.A. The DVD also includes music videos for NYC, PDA, and Obstacle 1.<br /><br />Update on DVD (12/21/12): Just watched the DVD. Some great stuff! 1st show from 2000 is pretty good. Liked hearing Song 5 live, and Precipitate. 2nd show from 2002 is even better. One mistake they made though in labeling was that they put down Precipitate for this show, when actually it's Specialist. Which is fine with me as Precipitate is again played in the 2000 show. The 3 videos for NYC, PDA, and Obstacle 1, are all cool. Only thing I didn't like was that for PDA, they cut out the outro (arguably the best part). Oh well.<br /><br />This album (referring to 1st disc) is nothing short of spectacular. Pretty much every song on here is a gem, and even my least favorite one or two are still pretty good. Interpol in my opinion is the BEST band still around that started within the last 10-15 years. That may just be why they got to open for the biggest touring band around of the last couple years, U2. TOTBL is definitely my favorite Interpol release, and this special anniversary edition serves asa fitting tribute to a classic album! This edition comes in some pretty nice \\"hard cover\\" binding (very smooth to the touch). It includes 48 pages of unpublished photos from 2000-2003, with liner notes by the band. Definitely a MUST for any fan! Do yourself a favor, and buy this great new release.
B000026C3T|4.0|The audio quality of the re-mastered tracks is fantastic but I wish they would have left off 2 or 3 of the more indulgent tracks like &#34;Achilles Last Stand&#34; and &#34;Celebration Day&#34; so &#34;Living Loving Maid&#34;, &#34;Over The Hill And Far Away&#34;, and &#34;Fool In The Rain&#34; could be included to make this a truly best of compilation.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|It actually took 3 days to receive this CD. It was dropped off on my porch and was damp to the touch even though I brought it in within 30 minutes and it was not raining.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I fell victim to the &#34;the best parts are in the trailer&#34; bait and switch trick. Solid acting and very well done CGI convinced me that I was actually watching a stuffed animal that came to life. Weak story is to blame here in my opinion.  I'd definitely recommend renting before buying on this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great version of Soitaire.  Colors are bright.  Cards move well.  Better than most of the games I have tried on Kindle Fire HD.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|I have heard this will turn in to weekly show .Thnk it is important someone is out there to show people this side of internet
B00000FC5H|5.0|Heard an EW&F song on the radio and decided to look for a Greatest Hits collection. Thank you to other reviewers who led me to this CD. Packed well and arrived in a timely manner.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Of course, I am a huge Twilight Fan so I love it.  Every song takes me back to a part in the movie.
B00005NNT1|5.0|I Love To Watch Snow White When. I Was A Little Boy I Use To Play On Stage Back In Chicago hieghts il.  Kidinggarden 2 GRADES My School Teacher Told You Look Like THE Guys On snow white That Is TOO QUITE It  I told My School Teach Thanks Alot Miss teacher.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|The movie had an excellent cast, but had a cheesy movie plot with cheesy lines :(  Could have been much better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|That My Favorite Tv serie I Love To Watch The Zombie Movie. Let Me Know When The Walking Dead Back Video.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|As a late adopter of technology, I bought my first smartphone two months ago.  I had used the Kindle application for the PC for a while and liked it so I downloaded the Android app to my Galaxy S3.  Kindle is just as easy to use on the Galaxy as it has been for the PC.  So far, there have been no glitches, just smooth functionality.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I Love To Watch The Walking Dead Thats My Favorite T.V. SERIE.<br />I Always To Watching Every Day On The Video By Computer Desktop.But I Never Get Tire To Watching The ZOMBIE.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best to make some time each day to log on, as you will be constantly watching this site.  Pin on.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Why am I writing a review of this film?  There are 412 reviews of this film at this very moment.  My birthday is April 12.  That's why.  And the film?  Did Sylvester Stallone ever make a bad action movie?  Don't answer that.  Cobra.  Did Sylvester Stallone ever make a bad action movie when he tried, really tried, to make a good one?  Don't answer that.  Rambo III.  Did Sylvester Stallone make one great action movie for every finger on your right hand?  Yes, of course he did.  Rambo.  Rambo II.  Demolition Man.  Rocky.  Rocky III.  Now you will need your left hand, too.  This film deserves a finger.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book keeps you reading from the beginning, I have to put it down at times so I read it so fast.  Usually, I can figure out the plot, but haven't been able as of yet.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|An excellent variation of the original Aliens movie with just enough new plot twists to make it worth your time.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Typical in-funny from a has been writer who shoulda just focused on something that wasn't just a rearrangement if everything he's already done into a boring and long mess of a movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down, It's one of the best books I've read this year.  It's not the type of book I usually read, I thought at first it was a detective novel, not at all....read it, and see for yourself.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I love Meryl Streep.  I did not love this whimpy character however.  Ms. Streep and I are of the same generation and I felt her character in this movie was more in keeping with the women of my mother's generation.  She seemed so beaten, so timid--so boring!<br /><br />The movie came across as contrived, I knew from the beginning how it would end.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|I love the movies. I hated the layout of this case. It keeps going and going and going. It's not practical and a pain in my arse. If you have so many discs, you should not keep folding. Just a suggestion.
B006AKIGUU|5.0|This is wonderful compilation of the works of a great musician. Very cool. Product arrived well packed and on a timelu basis. Thanks!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I use to watch this when I was little and loved it. I wish it wasn't so old so that there were actual special features, but whatcha gonna do. Movie is still great.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire game is really good.<br />The down side is ever time you select a new hand you get pop up advertisements.  If these advertisements were blocked out I would have made this a five star review.
B009IQG5LK|3.0|Let's just get this out of the way; Dick Tracy is a blatant Batman '89 rip off.  The distinct visual style, the heavily made up villians, the Danny Elfman score, even the ending is right out of Batman '89.  That being said, it's still a fun movie.  Warren Beatty's take on Dick Tracy is totally straight to the point of being bland, but everyone else seems to be having fun.  The visuals of the film are fun with the use of an extremely limited color palette, and Elfman's score is grand.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is where my praise for this blu-ray ends.  This is the barest of barebones editions, with not so much as the film's trailer included (although oddly you get some non-Dick Tracy trailers).  You get a digital copy of the film, does that count as an extra?  Technically the film is fine, although the transfer comes off as a bit flat.  I know this is an older film, but I've seen films much older than this that pop on blu-ray.  Again, the transfer is fine, just not dazzling.  I'd wait for this one to hit the bargain bin.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My family had a great time watching this movie...it should definitely be in your list of movies to see during the Christmas Holiday!
B009329ZF2|4.0|Though cheesy in some respects, my boys were captivated by the bountiful array of movie graphics. It is best to watch on a large flat screen with quality sound system to enhance the experience.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Decent movie, and could have been about 30 mins shorter and still been interesting. Not sure I would recommend to a friend though or ever watch again.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|There is no problem with the game itself.  It works as intended and is perfect copy of yahtzee.  The only draw back is unlike other &#34;with&#34; games this one is more luck then skill, hence limiting your control of winning.  It is still a fun game and good as a quick break, but it is a very quick break if not playing multiple opponents.
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|One of the worst movies I have seen in along time, and which is sad considering the actors is this. I wish I could get a refund.
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|If you like rom-coms... this one is very well written. There are a lot of rich layers to the story which make the characters really enjoyable to get to know. Anna Faris is beyond adorable and brings the plot to life. Chris Evans is a really good leading male. He's the right amount of badass to make his sweetness very sweet.<br /><br />I laughed a few times and it left me very smiley.<br /><br />Good story, good music, great acting, fun watch overall.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie!!  Never a dull moment!!!  Also appropriate for kids!!! I look forward to watching this movie every year!!!
B007URCTOG|2.0|The movie is more sad than happy. There are cute moments, but overall don't expect a rom-com since there isn't much &#34;com&#34; involved. If you're looking for a good, sad love story... this would do.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Great movie! Jim Carey did an excellent job. The ghost of Christmas past was so funny, parents and kids both laughed!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have sure liked playing Mahjong.  I had the game on my computer several years ago and missed having it.  It plays pretty well on my Kindle Fire.  It hangs up occasionally but infrequently - not any more than any other games do, it seems.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is pretty cool. I think its probably the best war game on the Kndle Fire, definately a game you should get.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a thought provoking story, with a message worth listening too.<br />Whether you see the movie or not, don't miss the book
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I found this movie very funny and entertaining, but the language definitely keeps it from being kid friendly, so for grown up eyes only!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very simple layout, clean lines and quick. Appears to be a small program, loads fast and i am yet to see any issues
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I had high hopes and was disappointed. Batman is hardly in the movie and when he is, his fight scenes are really weak!!
B0095R64AO|1.0|What a depressing movie. The previews were certainly misleading. I'm a big Jason Segel fan and this came up very short.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. it is so much fun to play. BEST GAME EVER I LOVE THIS Game. Thank you for reading this.
B005KR6NJU|5.0|You have to give this a try if you are a Star Wars fan and love CGI animation. By no means this is a cartoon series!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really enjoyed this account of Dr. Alexander's experience of heaven.  It was unique in some ways and in other ways shared characteristics of other after-death experiences.  Although some of the personal tale seemed long-winded while reading, it all made sense in the end.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Do yourself a favour, stop watching TV get this book read it and do the work!<br />you'll see results but only if you want to
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Watched this with the whole family even though my 7th grader refused since she had already made up her mind that she was not going to like it. Standing ovation by all
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love it! Had a Harry Potter movie marathon with my younger cousins who have never seen it before and they loved it!
B003XNTTYY|5.0|Loved this trilogy of books.Was just that little bit different to other books,and was fun to see were it all ended up
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Haven't seen this? You're stupid. Buy it. Watch it. Marvel. Or be disappointed because I overhyped it. Frankly, I don't care.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|For a purchase of over $200 I think the camera should have been working without having to buy this app!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A thorough , well written  book based on author's  near death experience, The author is a neurosurgeon who describes his  experience in graphic detail, both in personal and scientific terms. I finished the book and  immediately  began to read it again.'
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This movie is a very good movie. I saw it in the movies and knew I would buy it once it was released on BluRay
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|First two Batmans were way better.  This one was slow and feels like had no real plot.  plus the voice of Bane was annoying as hell.
B002G1ZHNQ|2.0|but it is definitely the case that I had buyers remorse for not having been able to actually pick up the book and leaf through it to see its potential value.<br /><br />It's possible a beginner or young practicioner might get something from this, but it's not for the experienced.
B0020M99LC|4.0|Despite the considerable liberties taken with mr. Fleming's book, Craig hits the mark as the hard bitten Bond. He is the man for this role going forward.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I have finished both games I wish they would come out with more updates sooner so I have started it over again. Waiting
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It was a cute movie. I liked how it showed all angles of what couples can go through - easy to watch
B0058VW36U|5.0|great game but needs more levels with harder ranges I'm still waiting for updated levels so I can keep playing
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This movie was just ok. Charlize Theron was amazing! Kristen Stewart was just ok, but it was a different spin on Snow White
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really loved this game, I finished it by cheating which now I wished I hadn't, I am playing it again
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I didn't expect to be blown away by this movie, but it was cute and easy to watch, Russell Brand was great and loved the songs.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love it my granddaughters love it we first played it in an arcade it's great to have it at home
B0086DBE62|5.0|I loved Julia Roberts in it - It was a really cute movie and a good spin on Snow White. The only weird thing was the song ending.
B004FOA84A|3.0|this is an ok game but I liked lost city better. I'm still working on this game too that's a good thing too.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Amazing Movie! Good way to end it, action was great, as well as acting! Loved basically everything about the movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|love this game, keeps you on your toes always chances to get better my granddaughters and I love it too
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very emotional, but anyone with a dog can relate, highly recommend to any pet lover.  A must read for anyone!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I loved this game but it needs lots more levels and skill ranges I'm still waiting for updates to keep playing
1439156816|5.0|The book is not only useful but also a good read. The author is candid and has a great sense of humor.
B0072V394E|5.0|A seminal film, haunting hero, scorching damsel, despicable villians, scenery to die for.  Hero has gattling gun and many do.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|It was pretty good.  The vampires were portrayed in a different light, but still good overall. The acting was believable and filming was realistic.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Overall the movie lacked a decent plot at the end, you were left saying, &#34;is that it, it that the whole movie?&#34;....  For a Bourne movie, very disappointing, and not what you've come to expect.
B00338QENI|4.0|I am a physician and read with great interest the story behind HELA cells which I learned about in Med school many years ago. Not only interesting scientifically but well worth reading about this poor unfortunate woman.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is back - with an unusually plot twisting &#34;can't put it down&#34; tale of Rapp's exploits.  Mitch Rapp is a black operative for the CIA and outdoes James Bond for &#34;reality.&#34;  Flynn leads the reader up one side and down the other in his inimitable style: tautly but straight forwardly written.  We all love to read the exploits of unsung heroes
B003UYUP58|4.0|I really learned a lot about Cancer even though I am a doctor. I particularly found the social and demographic background of lung cancer and smoking interesting.<br />A good read for doctors and non medical people.
141659521X|4.0|Excellent Book.  What can be said about Vince Flynn that has not been said before.  Keep writing about Mitch Rapp!!
B007TXN4TK|2.0|Didn't play the way I had hoped.  Not enough songs to choose from. Difficult to get the timing down even though I really do play the piano!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great book to lose myself in. I hated to put it down! A great read! Thank Ms Kelly.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Enjoyed it--am now on Book 2. Due to my lack of historical knowledge, it's a bit challenging, but I will learn as I go!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|It's a classic film.  Funny, witty, but it's for the open minded; not the stoic. I'm just writing because it wouldn't let me submit without more language.  Not doing these anymore.  I want to say what I want to say in as few words as possible.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I thought the book would be more edgy based off of the talk, but I was not as shocked as I thoght I would be. Story was ok, but the ending could be better.
B008476HBM|5.0|Great book.  Can't go wrong with a classic book.  Love the kindle addition. Can read on kindle and my phone.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I am an inexperienced chess player and I have tried other chess apps in the past.  They were all too hard for me, even on the lowest levels.  I like this one because I have a chance of beating it once in a while, on the lowest level.  I do not know how challenging it would be for those who are highly skilled, but for a beginner, this is great.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book kept me rivited becasue it took sometime to determine what was actually happening.  I hate books whereby you can guess the ending well before it happens. There weren't too many characters that make it had to keep track of who's who, the descriptors were just enough to get a picture in your mind (Not Stephen Kingish who sometimes grotesquely overdescribes things), and the entire premise is something new.  I read the short after the book in which Mr. Crouch describes his love of the show Twin Peaks.  Since he &#34;based&#34; this book on his enjoyment of the TV show, I thought I'd give it a go.  Unfortuantley, I didn't make it beyond 2 shows.  However, that certainly doesn't take away from the quality of Pines.
B0049J3QF4|4.0|Watched this with a toddler.  The movie did not capture his attention and keep it.  He got bored with this movie about half way through.  It is probably meant for an older audience.  I enjoyed the cars in the movie and the moral of the story was a good one too.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  While its a well-written, fictional novel, it's rooted in factual events that made me want to learn more about World War II. .  Thank you Mr. Follett!  Definitely a series that I would recommend.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a really useful app for getting straight into your yahoo e-mail.  It is simple and straightforward. easy to use.  What more could you want?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I held off reading this series for awhile because i couldnt get the \\"young adults\\" label out of my head. Within the first chapter i completely changed my thinking on this series. Suzanne Collins has written an amazing story that draws you in and makes you feel like you know these characters. This will continue to be a favorite of mine for a very long time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app works well for me.  It is dependable and does everything I wanted it to do: wake me up.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Studied Plato and Aristotle in college.  I'm not sure Taleb totally understands their context relative to the Peloponnesian War, or their value in asking questions vs. truly believing in the philosopher-king, which Aristotle critiques.<br /><br />That being said, I think he is an incredibly important thinker who will make you think about the way the world works - and what's knowable.  And how we might respond.<br /><br />Would love to see a debate between him and the author of \\"The Beginning of Infinity.\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|We play this all the time wish we got more coins quicker it takes thirty seconds to get a coin love playing but not going to pay extra for coins.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|ENJOYED THE BOOK.  SINCE THIS WAS THE FIRST NOVEL, THAT I DOWN-LOADED, PHEW, GLAD THAT I DIDN'T MESS ANY-THING UP.  WILL BE SHOPPING FOR MORE, TIME PERMITTING.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I Really enjoyed the show.  It is definitely NOT something I would recommend for children to watch though.I would watch it again.
B008I43DYU|5.0|WAS LOOKING FOR A BASIC CALCULATOR, WITHOUT TOO MANY EXTRA FEATURES, TO CONFUSE USAGE.<br />NEEDED AN EASY TO USE AND READ APP.
B001706I5I|5.0|I love this movie, a great christmas laugh! My children and I enjoy watching it year after year.  It never get old.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|IF I WAS A BETTER ARTIST, THIS APP WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE INTERESTING.  I HAVE QUITE LARGE FINGERS, SURE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME FINER LINE DRAWING OPTIONS.
B000005H7D|5.0|Esta grabación es una de las más importantes de Coltrane. Temas con mucha fuerza y alta calidad. Para escuchar y disfrutar todo el tiempo.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This Lav mic has improved the quality of my audio, especially the interviews I've recently filmed. If you're forgetful, like I can be, make sure the mic is turned on and off each time; as well as keeping up with the battery.
B000W4KSWO|5.0|En esta grabación hay temas hermosos y llenos de amor. La unión de Duke y Coltrane es suave y tranquila. Para los que gustan del jazz de alta calidad.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is Amazing! for $7 this is worth buying it. I highly recommend this game to everyone. Nothing bad to say about this game.
B000002ADT|5.0|Una de las grabaciones más importantes del jazz. Música tranquila y memorable. Es la unión de grandes músicos y todo coleccionista debe tenerla.
B002VWNID6|1.0|Please review my movie before sending out to me, I love this movie, but I never get to finish seeing it. It finishes at the 17th chapter. I always miss the best part of the movie. It would be nice to see the whole movie when its not defected.
B0000A118M|5.0|Esta grabación es de alta calidad musical. Uno de los clásicos del jazz de todos los tiempos. Temas muy espirituales.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|The sound quality on this movie was terrible, you could not hear half of the dialogue, even with the volume on my surround sound up to 60 % other then that it probably was a good movie. Who knows.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Esta es una de los mejores productos sobre la banda. Con un DVD que presenta las canciones más conocidas. En esta grabación están todos los grandes temas.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really liked it! I was drawn into the story, almost like I knew them. I couldn't wait to pick it up and read more. I did have the Kindle version, and could not make out the pictures and letters. Other than that It was great! I have pre-ordered the next book and I hope it's just as good!
B0000691U1|5.0|Esta grabación reúne a dos grandes del jazz. Se trata de una obra musical pensada como un concierto con varios movimientos. Los sonidos son realmente fascinantes.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A fun novel taking you down a nicely crafted path.  It's been a long time since I have read a total escape novel. The characters were fun and it was a great ride all the way through.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|La edición de este clásico es muy buena. Se trata de dos cd con la obra completa de esta banda. Música de alta calidad.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I poured through this book.  The characters were interesting and made the pre WWI historical events come alive.  I couldn't put it down.  Ken Follett gave us a great story written in an artful writing style.
B000002AH7|5.0|En esta grabación Miles interpreta una obra clásica de la música culta. Una excelente producción llena de sonidos tranquilos y muy inteligentes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a Lot of fun. Wish there weren't so many ads though. Already played a lot. It's basic solitaire
B00004VWAF|4.0|En esta grabación está Miles lleno de instrumentos elctrónicos. Es música llena de muy buen ritmo para bailar el jazz. Un coleccionista debe tenerla.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Ok....so I am not a kid, nor do I have any. I am an aspiring artist who happens to love anything that is animated. which is sad I know, but Que Sera Sera. I loved this movie a tad bit to much for my age lol. If you have liked movies like \\"how to train your dragon\\" or \\"hotel translavania\\" (very funny movie btw) then you will like \\"Rise of the Guardians\\".
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I gave this rating cause the action was wonderful and loved the fact of who all was in it, I love movies like this cause I can really get into them. I would recomend this movie to anyone who loves action movies.
1423140605|5.0|All of my children loved this book.  They read it immediately, one after another. It is from a good series.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|The whole family loves this movie.  The imagination, music, lyrics, and of course defeating the bad guys (can you tell I have grandsons) make this an enjoyable experience.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The Last Man is a great read.  As usual Fllynn grips you from the beginning.  Great insight into the country and politics.A very good read.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My sister is a huge Harry Potter fan. I bought this DVD collection for her birthday and I have lost count of how many times she has watched it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Winter of the World.  Very good, but not as great as the first book of this trilogy.  Very interested to read the last book to see if it compares to the first.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|My sister (and I) are both huge fans of the TV series and I bought this boxed set of DVDs for her birthday. We really enjoy rewatching Gibbs and company.
B005R32L66|2.0|I just got a Polaroid Android tablet with a front-facing webcam as a gift.  Skype downloaded and installed great and I could use it to send IMs fine.<br /><br />However, it came up with an alert when it first ran saying that it wasn't sure if it would work with my device's video camera, and that they're working on it.  Sure enough, it did not work with either my device's camera or my buddy's Samsung phone that we also tried it on (and also had the same alert).<br /><br />I've used Skype in the past and love it, but it looks like this particular version just needs a few bugs fixed.  I'll be sure to update my review once it works :-)
B006LSZECO|5.0|EXCELLENT BOOK. This book is a page turner that has quite a few twists and turns. Haven't read a book this good for a long time.
B0000524CY|5.0|this is still the scariest movie i've ever seen ,when i fist seen it year's ago, i had nightmare's! it's amazing what the devil can do to someone!
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I've never really gotten into Halo. At best, the Halo game series is a mediocre way to waste some time. I completely lost interest after dragging through the second game... so despite the mostly good reviews I held off on watching this for a while. This movie, however, was just frigging AMAZING. I love sci-fi movies in general, and this has to be in my top 5 of all time. Like I said, I am not a big fan of the games, but this movie kicks butt, well worth the time and money to watch! The plot is fine, the characters are believable, and the action is AWESOME. In all caps.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I was introduced to this series by a friend, and was hooked. The plot is constantly intense, and as a musician, the musical score is fabulous!
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is our favorite show. We can watch it over and over and over again. Highly recommend to new parents or people with a close knit group of friends.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I love the original NCIS, but it's taken a second seat to NCIS:Los Angeles. The acting ensemble is terrific; the plots and sub-plots are riveting and compelling.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I rate Homeland highly for story and fine for acting but sometime it is a little out of touch with the real world (Marine Sgt's slugging Marine Captains?) (Agency interrogation rooms with camera dead spots?) (Dim bulb Directors of Operations?) Maybe I am just a little picky and should be able to suspend much disbelief.  Its not the Wire but the Wire wasnt without its failed moments altho an Omar in Homeland would be a real kick.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just recently jumped on the Walking Dead bandwagon and can't believe it took me this long to get into the show. I watched the first 2 seasons on Netflix then I downloaded the current season on Amazon and was able to watch it on my fire, my macbook, and my tv through xbox.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|My husband is addicted to this show. It is mindless entertainment for him. The part that sucks is characters keep dying off and new ones keep coming. We hope this show continues.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE IN YOU HOUSE COLLECTION, BUY IT BECAUSE REALLY IT IS !!
B00A757EFW|3.0|This used to be one of my all time favorite games to play! It is still fun on the kindle fire however, it seems to be a lot harder to control than i remember!
B008M721MS|1.0|I bought two Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" 32G tablets for my husband and I for Christmas presents.  He is a marine, I thought that for his deployment this would be great for entertainment and communication.  This app has worked correctly once.  Just one single time.  The speakers stopped putting out what he was saying, the screen freezes, calls are \\"busy\\" over and over again (even though we confirmed the other person is not making a call).  I'll be deleting this App and might try to re-download, but I don't have much faith.<br /><br />This is separate from the Skype review - but I'm incredibly disappointed with my Kindle over all.  It seems that most things don't work - except for things eligible for purchase off of Amazon.  I am an avid PC/Android user - and I hate to say it - but I wish I had just bought an IPAD.
B0061S073A|5.0|this app is great to restrict ghd Kindle for small kids. They can only access what you let ghem thru kids place.
B008Y6S07M|5.0|Great acting by Will and his son. The story behind the movie is even more interesting. When the father was homeless the kid was really a toddler.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|does not work for me .  la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Excellent movie - enjoyed the story of young teens who are misfits to the so called rich one, who were shown to be snobs.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Great cast of characters..especially the little girl..A must for watching while I wrap presents or write Christmas cards. Would be a great gift for folks with a love for Christmas movies.
0760335540|5.0|This has to be one of the best service manuals that I have seen.  It has really good, easy to follow, step by step instructions with illustrations for most of the repairs and services that you would have to otherwise take to the dealer.
B0074V3712|4.0|Considering what I learnt at school,times have changed and this book,refreshed or taught a whole lot of new facts that have come along,the reading is easy,and comparing us to social insects makes it a lot more understandable
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This flash works great on my Nikon D80, and D3200.  It's compact enough that it hardly takes up space in my camera bag, but it delivers a brighter flash than what the cameras come with.  It also adjusts vertically so that you can bounce the flash off the ceiling, but it doesn't adjust horizontally.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I don't know...Mark Walberg ruined this for me.  It wasn't that funny.  The bear swears a lot, which is kind of funny to see but it gets old.  Tired story line.  Mila Kunis is hot.  I would take a Steve Carrel movie over this any day.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As usual with Bosch books, my Kindle followed me everywhere. 3 days later, and after much abandoned day-job workload, I clicked on the last page. The characters continue to evolve and the revisiting of Harry’s early career on the beat added to the unexpected turns in the plot. Now if Harry could just manage to hold a personal relationship together, be it with his daughter or his latest love, and put his job second for once, he would be a lot happier in life. But then he wouldn’t be Harry.
B00A4TKDKY|2.0|I'm a huge Buddy Guy fan and have seen many, many concerts. This CD is not a true picture of Mr. Guy. It's amazing that a artist of his stature can't get a full length CD that represents one of his live concerts. Frankly, it disgusts me. All his fans want is a full length CD/DVD of one of his unedited concerts. Luckily I purchased live performances from his club that were recorded by Pirate Records several years ago. Buy it if you must but beware of it's length and quality.
B0000024YL|5.0|I think this is the third time I have purchased this in my lifetime. And I am older than dirt.. I have an album that is in great shape, but it would be a pain to hook up the turntable and copy it.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I thought  up all night was good. this is better. as I one direction fan I think its great that everyone has a solo. good job guys.
B00026WU64|2.0|I thought I was more of a Dylan fan, but I guess not. I know that a few of his hits are great, but this disc will be in the rummage sale.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|I've been a Beatles fan since the late 70's and have all of the American releases on lp as well as the original cd's, the mono and stereo cd box sets, etc. When I found out this came out I was very excited; however, the 1 and 2 star (even 3 star reviews) had me very concerned about purchasing this set. I had read where the vinyl (especially on side 2 of ABBEY ROAD) had pops, hisses, &#34;zipper&#34; like noises, etc. Nevertheless I decided to gamble and purchase this set and told myself that if I encountered the problems that I had read about on Amazon I would simply turn the box set in and ask for a refund (as opposed to having a replacement box sent to me). When I placed my order I sent a message to Amazon to make sure they sent me a box that did not have any outer visible damage (no dings, no bent corners, etc.) I am pleased to say that Amazon sent me a box that is very nice and one that I would be proud to display on my shelf. I have listened to the &#34;problem&#34; albums (again, side two of ABBEY ROAD seems to be the most mentioned in terms of hiss and noise) and I have to say that there is no noticeable noise, cracks, pops of any kind. The only reason I'm giving the set four stars is because the back cover of the PAST MASTERS lp is messed up towards the bottom of the cover. There are noticeable marks in the back of the PAST MASTERS album jacket that look like something scuffed it up pretty bad. There's also a scuff on the WITH THE BEATLES cover (though not as noticeable). All in all I'm glad I purchased the set. The hardcover book is out of this world and done very well. I would have to say if you are &#34;on the fence&#34; about buying this box set after reading the reviews it might be somewhat worth the risk in getting a good copy (like I did), especially if you are really wanting the box. Again, I felt like taking the risk in buying it despite the reviews and to my listening ears the vinyl sounds good.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|It was every thing I expected from Men in Black....drama and action with a little humor. Over all worth it.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you like The Hangover, you will really love this movie!  Rent it or buy it, you won't be dissappointed.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is an amazing read. You will not be disappointed. Its for dog lovers and those who've over come what you never dreamed you could.
B00011CZRE|3.0|If you are used to horror movies then this movie will be nothing for you to watch. For me, it was a bit graphic. I get the point of the seven deadly sins, but it was a bit gruesome in my opinion.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|This movie has promising moments but for the most part underdelivers. Bruce Wayne is an EMO crybaby throughout and gives up the superhero role entirely by the conclusion of the film.<br /><br />I never read the comics so maybe it i true to the storyline but, if so, I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />What a crybaby-fest.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie will bring tears to your eyes! Just when you're on the brink of giving up this movie will motivate you to keep pushing forward!! There is light at the end of the tunnel.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|Cute graphics, and the minigames are fun.  My son hates needles though, and one of the games has you stab a syringe into an animal's butt (you don't see it go in, it just pops), then push the plunger down, and finally put a bandaid on puffy red welt left there.<br /><br />The game play gets boring after 10-20 minutes.
1881273989|5.0|This book is great for everyone! It helps you to learn more about yourself and what your love language is as well as about other people. Not just your significant other, but your family and friends. It will help you to better understand others and how they interpret love. Everyone is unique and typically falls into one of the categories.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love the art in this and the game play is a good take on the original.  Lots of new things to see.
B000JLSLZQ|4.0|Great movie enjoyed it a lot.  Loved the music wish i can see it on broadway.  Emmy Rossum did great.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian is really a hidden gem.  The book takes off on the first page and never slows down until the very end.  Andy has filled the story with a lot of interesting details, facts, and science.<br /><br />If you love science, space travel, or human perseverance you will love The Martian.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book started a little slow for me but really ramped up into an exciting read that left me wanting more.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The inter-tangling of the stories was stunning. Only one big chase scene, but it was great.<br /><br />Hopefully there is one more on the way.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|I needed some Christmas music since I was hosting a Christmas party, I like Zooey Deschanel, and the mp3 album was on sale for a mere couple of bucks so to me it was a no brainer to buy this.  Overall it is just okay.  Nothing spectacular.  I'd say about 30% of the songs are enjoyable for me where the rest were blah and not the best feature of Zooey's vocals.  For the price I paid and because I needed music for my party, I am satisfied with my purchase.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is Always a good read.  Can't get enough of him. I read till late in the night as usual
B004EPZ06G|5.0|This is a funny movie, and my brother, and I like it just as much as the first one. The dvd arrived in great shape, and we love watching it!
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Irredeemably gory, to the point now where I question why I could possibly watch a TV show that might feed unstable viewers' blood lust.  More gaps in plausibility than before.  A certain young male character continues to grate, but then his parents are no better.  Not sure the series will sustain my interest for a whole season.  But not giving up quite yet...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I always like Grisham novels, but having him write in the first person as an African American antagonist was odd and not necessary to the story.  As Grisham novels go, this one was as enjoyable as the next, but not particularly memorable.
B000SW4DXK|4.0|My family really enjoys this great remake of an older version.  The actors are great, the scenery/decorations are truly delightful.  It tells a good hearted story that makes you feel good about Christmas, and know that there are still a lot of good people in this world.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|brilliant - have to read all 3 books. it is a easy read and keeps you captivated. absolute recommendation - good holiday read
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Eric Nylunds' simple and fluid prose is a quick and energetic read. I found myself desperate at night when I had to put this novel down to go to sleep. My only consolation...knowing I would pick up again on my commute to work. If you're a fan of the Halo video game's this is a MUST read. If you never played the games and have no idea what Halo is, Nylunds' introduction to the fictitious sci-fi world is worth a read as well. I would even go as far as to say if you are not a science fiction fan give this book a try. It has a lot of human drama and a sympathetic main character in John 117.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|brilliant - have to read all 3 books. it is a easy read and keeps you captivated. absolute recommendation - good holiday read
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I am a zombie fan like most 25 year old men and had hoped for something with a bit more rotting meat on its bones. The fictional story tellings were often very well done but I never had the emotional response that I would have expected from reading first hand account of the zombie apocalypse. I think this is due to the fact that as a rule, none of the characters that we most intimately identified with were killed/zombified. We only see the survivors and as such I feel we are robbed of the emotional response. Most interviews are short, only a few pages a most. This is enough lenghth to get the story of what happened to them, but I must admit they are now almost all, forgotten. By the time I got to the end, and the characters start repeating, I honestly had little to no recollection of their original stories.<br /><br />However, the world building and attention to detail in creating a wholly realized zombie apocalypse was very convincng. I never thought that I wasn't here on planet earth with just the addition of zombies. I am aware that there is another book by the same author that detials the zombie virus in increased detail. Although that book is not necessary to enjoy this one I am sure that it is helpful. If you are picking this up in order to be prepared for the movie, I don't know how much they will overlap (based on the trailer, not much).
B007L3BMGA|5.0|What a great read. Cannot put the book down once you start reading it. All 3 is a must to read. Story really unfolds in last book. absolute recommendation - a MUST read !
B009OYSFDM|5.0|If they don't make a second season I will be shocked. I absolutely loved this show! Watched it on Amazon while deployed and it made my day every time I got to see it.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I purchased this cover for the new 7&#34; Kindle Fire that I purchased for my 4 year old grandson.  It fits the device like a glove but I do wish that the magnet was a  little stronger.  When I first closed it and turned it upside down it came back open.  The magnet is only in one small section at the top of the cover instead of running down the entire side or at least at the top and bottom.  As I keep checking the settings and downloading  everything it seems to be holding it closed.  It is a Christmas gift so it still hasn't be used by the 4 year old so if anything changes then I will write a new review.  I would recommend this cover.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Constant ads. Spend the money for the game and enjoy it and not ads. I'm way to old to want to join a dating service.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|A great wrap to the trilogy.  The ending was well done and even left you looking for a spin off.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|Bee Movie is one of those cute movies that has perfect animation. The storyline has a happy ending with plenty of tension in the middle, so it will leave you feeling satisfied. The movie explores the consequences to humans if the bees demanded all their honey back.There are plenty of puns, Seinfeld style. It gives you a look at the world from a bee's perspective and presented with fantastic computer animation. If you have children you will not be disappointed with the purchase. And your children will develop a respect for bees.
B0060D123K|5.0|This Christmas Carol has all the charm the Muppets are famous for while remaining true to the original work. Michael Cain's profound portrayal of the miserly and miserable Mr. Scrooge is as effective as his transformation into the humble and generous Uncle Ebenezer is affective. Moreover, the soundtrack will keep playing in your head so the movie can stay with you until the next Christmas Season. I love this movie and am moved every time I watch it! Do not deprive yourselves of the experience.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Loved it - great fun for the whole family.  Lots of action and humor. Would watch it again for sure!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It was what I expected, The Avengers brand new. It's what I bought and paid for, did get here on time as well. Good product.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great read my youngster thoroughly enjoyed it and has read all the series.  Would recommend all kids read the book
B0029QRA1U|4.0|I had an older version of this for my PC, but I switched to Apple and the software just wouldn't work. This was MUCH eaiser set up, really just pulg and play and looks better too! The only thing with most of these products is that you can't pause the recording to turn over the album, it is a real pain. I think you have to get the professional equipment, but you'd think they could get software to do that.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|A wonderful and beautiful masterpiece by the geniuses at studio ghibli. This film is great for kids or the kid in all of us.
030758836X|1.0|I started reading this and was very put off by the overwrought prose and couldn't decide whether or not to continue. Other reviews convinced me to forget it. A lot of hype and lots of trees killed in the name of self-indulgent excess.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome app. I'm not very good but it's still fun. I think this is the best app ever created.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I liked the first movie very much. The second movie had a riveting perfomance by Heath Ledger that made up for structural flaws. This movie is structurally, logically, and morally a mess.<br /><br />Many spoilers below...<br /><br />The whole first third of the movie moves like molasses, though Bane is an interesting and formidable<br />character. Catwoman is shoehorned into the plot and is so despicable and amoral<br />in the beginning that I never grew to like her character at all and I certainly<br />can’t imagine why Batman would, although Anne Hathaway is pretty hot in that<br />catsuit, so I guess that mitigates Batman’s stupidity.<br /><br />I thought it was sort of interesting that Wayne lost all his money, although the<br />mechanism for his losing it is complete nonsense. Of course, somehow he gets to keep his mansion,<br />so he has access to all his batstuff. Except somehow he loses track of his fusion reactor/bomb thingie. Yeah, that would totally happen.<br /><br />Then, Alfred takes a powder, just when Bruce needs him the most, then disappears from the movie entirely, except for the prototypical Nolan ambiguous ending. I can only assume there are deleted scenes with him in them. Otherwise, it was a completely foolish plot point, intended only to strip Batman of his closest ally (oh, and I<br />suppose a little bit to forward the idea that Batman is more valiant and capable if he fears death…say what now?).<br /><br />In the comics, Bane does indeed beat Batman bloody and break his back, but it doesn't work in a<br />film context. In Frank Miller's famous Dark Knight Returns, Batman takes on<br />Superman himself and kinda wins. Bane is gonna beat him? Please. And who heals a<br />broken back with a rope pulley and cheery thoughts from a guy who speaks English when it's suddenly convenient?<br /><br />The Batman is also supposed to be wicked smart, not just indomitable and brave and so forth. He never<br />outsmarts anybody in Nolan's films because Nolan isn't that smart and couldn't think of a way to outwit Bane. Batman is the World's Greatest Detective, but he never detects anythng in these movies, just punches everything a lot and has cool toys invented for him by this Fox guy who is a nonentity in this movie, a terrible waste of Morgan Freeman's talents.<br /><br />Lots of other problems. Bane knows all of Wayne's secrets? How did that happen?<br />The League of Shadows is still dedicated to...huh? Miranda was the child in the pit? What now?<br /><br />The whole plot of this movie is a soap bubble that only wishes it was as substantial as cellophane.<br /><br />I am giving this misbegotten mess two stars because there are occasional good moments, like &#34;So, that's what that feels like.&#34; and &#34;This isn't a car.&#34; Also, Anne Hathaway in a catsuit; that's worth a star right there. Otherwise, meh.
B003O86FMW|4.0|There is a lot of descriptions, so truthfully, I skipped most of the book to the action and dialogue. It's a little confusing to younger people, but overall it is a pretty good book, but not as good as the first one.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|This documentary features interviews with many actors who were featured in his movies. They tell what working with him is like. Allen responds to their comments as only he can. In the process, the viewer is able to remember the highlights of one of our greatest filmmakers on two DVDs. Don't miss it.
B003T0G9XU|4.0|Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite authors while the book is fantasy his parallel to reality is astoundingly insightful and funny what a talent loooove it
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|My husband was working late and I was looking for a way to pass the time. This was a fun movie but most definitely a chick flick, I would never subject my husband to this movie or any movie like this.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is the best one I've read since I can remember it's better than around the world in eighty days and 20000 leagues under the sea I hope Jack London makes a sequel to the book it was wonderful
B001EC2ISA|1.0|Was only able to get it on my IMac.  Would not use the amazon for viewing movies.  We really like the movie.
B0068FZ1AU|5.0|This Blu-ray DVD was entertaining from start to finish.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys light musicals with a decent plot.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Surprisingly, it was a better movie than I was expecting, lots of action, once it got going, a little slow at first.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Minimal ads, and they don't pop up during play. This is a fun game to play by yourself. I highly recommend it.
B00A23MYCC|3.0|This is a funny movie if I were in my 20's-30's, member of a Frat House. or just loved stupid humor....<br />I will admit, there were parts that were funny... Not a film I'll watch over & over...
B0076DELIG|1.0|I have always enjoyed reading the Bosch series of books but this one feels like the author is running out of ideas. It is quite simplistic,  formulaic and fails to live up to the minimum standards of the detective genre.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|I am enjoying this book and love the setting and characters, but at times feel like I am being beaten over the head with the protagonists self discovery.  But a fun read overall.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Not as good as Season 1, in my opinion, but still interesting and freaky. There is a LOT to take in and keep track of in this season so you have to pay really close attention. It is a very dark and disturbing story line so this definitely isn't for kids.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Excellent app. They should all work this well. It probably gives you more information than the average person cares about but I'm certain the technology minded people will be happy with it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|So glad someone told me to watch this show. One of the best shows out there as far as writing, acting (Claire Danes is AMAZING in this), story line, cast...I could go on. It is relateable in this day and age and actually gets me more interested in keeping up with real life current events. Can hardly wait until Seaosn 2 is ready for purchase.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Thought I would love it but it wasn't my favorite. I really wanted to like it but it was just a bit slow. Maybe cause we got the unrated version? Maybe the regular version would have had a better flow to it.
B009TH2ENG|5.0|I had not read the previous Fables books but I am a Huge Werewolf fan and so this title pulled me in. I was happy to see it available on Kindle and when I saw that, I had to get it right away. I thought the premise was good and could see it as a possible base story for a motion picture. This makes me want to go and get the rest of the series as well so I can get all the back stories and understand some of the references. Hopefully I can get those on Kindle too. -James
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|It was entertaining. There was more storytelling than I had expected but it was good overall. It did bring the background facts to light and that always helps.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Good clean family fun movie , watch it with all and not have to worry ,they need to make more of them
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Awesome...saw it at the movies and knew right away I needed it for my collection.  If you like something different, fresh humor, and a movie where you can't begin to guess the ending, this one's for you.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved it and it was hard to put down.  I was up one morning until 2:00 reading it because I had to see what happened next.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I watched the movie, not expecting much and I was blown away. Although some have pointed out that not everybody on the soundtrack are \\"singers\\", they are far from bad. The musical arrangements are extraordinary as well.<br /><br />The soundtrack blows the broadway version out of the water. Even Tom Cruise did the music justice and I'm not a big fan of his.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love this show, i just watched the first season and love this season too... its edgier than first season and so well written!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Sanderson always manages do a great job with his world building. Each of his book has a completely different magic system, and this one is no different. It's a fascinating journey that ends too soon. I demand a proper sequel!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|goofs game I love it its challenging and fun. love how there's a lot of games in one huge app.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|It was okay, I'm sure little ones will love it.  But Disney Pixar has had better, wasn't for me though.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|this game is so awesome I love it when you get to change the topic.I also like it when you get farther up you go faster and there's new stuff up there.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|The first time I ordered an Impossible film (Push for SX70)I had a very bad experience.<br />I decided to give the Impossible project another chance and I bought this film. I am very happy to tell you that this does work.<br /><br />Just a Tip. I used a piece of a plastic bag to wrap (several times) the end of my camera so the film won't be ruined. Just be careful because the piece of plastic might appear in your picture.<br />Tip 2. WAIT 30 minutes or more after the film comes out. You don't wanna mess with your picture.<br />Tip 3. If you adjust the white balance of your camera, you should use a tripod to take the picture. The best you can do is set the wheel in the middle. Don't touch it.
B009ZE27US|2.0|this app is a waste of space don't bother! it NEVER gets the age right -_____-  this was a complete waste of time
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I pre-ordered and saved $2.95. A great box set for the money!  The FX are spectacular with an overall sound story line that draws you in. I can't wait to see what comes next!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Such an addicting show! Haven't finished season five but have watched all the other seasons and have not been dissapointed.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|this app is great. I use it to listen to new songs that haven't been released yet. but on kindle fire please be aware you cant record as the kindle fire has no mic. kthxbaii
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This was a totally forgettable movie with great actors just straight up mailing in their performances. Pass on this one.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is a hoot, we love playing it. It is a great addition to the Kindle Fire. And a lot of fun.
0307460444|5.0|I may not use every recipe, but this gives me ideas to use for cupcakes for all kinds of occasions. Handy reference to have around.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Kids love this movie!  ( but you have to stay with them and FF adult scenes) Anyway, great movie great seller, and I paid right under $10, don't hesitate, go ahead and buy!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed reading about the historical foudation for this novel and was struck by how things through time have not changed.<br /><br />We still have poor reasons for beginning a war; negotiation is what ends a war, but few think to use that tactic first. Wars create hardships for people who don't deserve it and praises fools for lying to a nation to achieve their end. Wars are first and foremost the genocides of the world. Little else is achieved.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Not a bad flick to watch but it's the same humor as an episode of Family Guy.  Just one more character that will have more fame than Seth MacFarlane.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult does it again.  A beautiful but sad story.  I had trouble putting the book down to do mundane things like working!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great book. I was able to read it in two days, I couldn't put it down. Recommend for anyone who likes an easy read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Everyone was recommending I read this book, so I did.  Not a single person told me what it was really about, just that I should read it....well...I've learned a lot!<br />Its a good book, I really like the story line.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book in two days--I just could not put it down. This is perfect for a flight or rainy day.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Since the kindle boots up faster than our PCs, this is a great way to check mail without waiting for a computer to boot up.  So far, it works fine, although a little clumsier than Yahoo! web-mail.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I loved this film when I saw it in the theatre.Purchased it as a stocking stuffer for my young family.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A very interesting read, without the hype.  The author is generous in his praise and acknowledgement of all who contributed to the success of the mission.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|There are some very funny lines, but I guess I was expecting more. Overall, still a good movie and worth it
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not as good as I had hoped, but entertaining none the less.  Will not watch it again or buy the dvd.
B000JIJPZY|1.0|I bought this for my 3 month old to get more tummy time but the &#34;pillow&#34; and I use that loosely is really small!  It barely pushes her up so her face just goes right into the mat.  The ball turns on the part that is turned up but that is it.  Not worth it at all.
B004EHZDE8|4.0|As I am just starting graduate school (at the masters level) I found this book to be very useful. It gave me an idea of the things that I should be keeping in mind or at least thinking about when trying to tackle graduate school. While I may not agree with all of the points that the author makes his insights are often very well based and it gets me to think about what he is saying either way. I definitely think that this book will help me as I progress through graduate school
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|It takes much too long on the movies/stories between each segment of the game.  It is TOO dark to see anything.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Loving a book with a subject like this might seem weird, but it took me places I thought our world had eliminated.  There's a special hell for those who treat human beings like there in hell...  in which there is no escape.
B001I9WK14|5.0|I saw this in theaters years ago, and wore out my old vhs copy. It's so timeless... I ordered an extra copy for the friend who introduced me to U2 in the early 80's. It's time we share the experience with our kids!
B007PFD90G|4.0|Understanding that this is a Memoir, one can only wonder why religious zealots would have to attack freedom of speech and how they can justify persecuting anyone in the name of god!  It seems as if this kind of behavior would only cause self destruction!  The only complaint I had was that the memoir was too long for me.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'm still in the process of reading this book, but I absolutely love it!! I don't want to put it down. It packed full of simple but deep truths about being animal and human, having a heart, and truly surviving. I'm really looking forward to seeing the film once I finish the book. There is some imagery in the book I will never forget that have made an impact on my life. It's amazing what we can learn about yourselves when we learn things about our earth bound counterparts, the animals. Truly a must read for everyone!
B00005QFE5|4.0|The Road Home is one of the most simple and tender love story I ever seen. It's noticeable the simplicity of the anecdote, the short dialogues and characterization, but overall very effective movie. Ziyi Zhang is lovely in her character as a very young woman that falls in love at first sight. Obviously one can't judge the social circumstances with occidental eyes. The atmosphere, and the values surround the feelings and actions are of the rural China, with long and strong traditions, sometimes in conflict with the communist view. I recommend it.
B003B02O14|4.0|I always enjoy reading John Grisham books.  I would definitely recommend this book to others.  I was a little disappointed in the ending though.
0345803493|1.0|****May Contain spoilers*****<br />After reading the first book I thought I would never read the second one. Well my friend assured me that the second one is really good and the books do get better. So what did I do? I went out and bought the second one. I really wished I hadn't though. These books get worse as they go on. I feel like there wasn't as much sex scenes as the first book. That made me more happy. I know its erotica, but where is the story line? That is what i look for in books. Not one that is basically porn. The second book kind of had a plot, but I felt like it was resolved too quickly. Even after a few more plots the book went on and on. The writing + the characters + no real story line quickly gets on your nerves. They have waaay too much sex. Ana is always turned on by the mere sight of him. I can really go on and on over how awful it is and say what other people have said 1000 times. The one thing that bothers me the most is how controlling and stalkerish he is! Ana allows him to be this way because she can't possible live without him and is scared to piss him and that he will leave her then she will be an absolute mess and can't live normally in life. Did I mention this is also exactly like Twilight except no Supernatural things go on?
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|This is a great movie. We always stopped to watch it when we saw it on TV. When I was preparing my Christmas Wish List, I saw the great price on this movie...which is almost impossible to find in the stores...I snatched it up. Can't go wrong with this and I got free shipping.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|I've used vertical/battery grips on my cameras for years, for the additional batteris of course, but also for the vertical controls that make portrait orientation shooting much more comfortable and because the added mass of the grip helps the camera balance better with larger lenses. I have used a pair of Canon BG-E7 on my two 7D cameras since day one (now over three years usage). IMO the only things that would make the BG-E7 any better would be a slightly slimmer grip section (it's a little \\"boxy\\" feeling) and a secondary joystick for AF point selection (see the BG-E11 for 5DIII, for example). This OEM Canon grip is better made and more durable than the third party grips, but costs more as a result. It is a good match for the quality of the 7D camera.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|The game kicked me out at Chapter 13.  I don't understand why this wasn't caught by the production crew.  In reading other reviews, it seems a LARGE number of users are having the same problem.  Really discouraging when you've had to pay for the game.  Also, you have to reduce the screen size in order to access certain objects when they are hidden around the edges.  Way too much work for the amount of fun.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the top shows I have ever watched. It's on the top of my list next to firefly &#60;3<br /><br />I do not recommend this for children at all. Wait until they go to bed :)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Classic Clancy!  I couldn't put it down and love the continuing story line from previous novel(s).  Great gift for your favorite Clancy fan.
B00AECGQF2|2.0|The person who is  writing all ithe reviews must have some relationship to the developer.  This is not kid friendly at all.  It is kidda creepy.  The reviews are over the top.  It is not the greatest app and don't buy it.  Stop the momentum bCause the reviews are not quite correct.  That is my opinion.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best SEAL stories I ever read.  Heart and Soul of a warrior and a shining example of the brave men that protect our country regardless of the cost.  The &#34;human&#34; side of the story (Adam's life-long battle with personal demons) brings out a side that is often neglected due to political correctness, and the additional focus on his family shows another side that is often forgotten, the families left behind.  God Bless each and every SEAL past, present, and future.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Virtual (kindle) page turner on a long flight to Asia. Vince Flynn back to old form. Will be looking for his next installment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the way this story was written and how it jumps from vantage point to vantage point.  Without giving away the ending, I  was disappointed with the unexpected ending.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|The story line seems quite a stretch of realty, but the singing is unparalleled<br />and leaves me in awe and emotional. Thank You Barbra and Michel
B000PDYVVG|1.0|One of the few books I MADE myself finish.  This lady could justify anything just by talking in circles.<br />Heaven help thiose whose life she touches
B009MFKO3M|3.0|Alt rock meets prog rock by way of psych rock. Besnard Lakes type vocals (only male) drenched in late 60's distant Gandalf reverb.  It all grooves!  Be Above It has an audaciously repetitive drum sound with vocals that live up to the title.  Endors Toi is equal parts psych and prog, a short version of what is to follow.  Apocalypse Dreams would be very much at home on a late 60's/early '70's pop prog record.  It's the best track on the album.  Mind Mischief is more contemporary sounding, yet still blessedly retro.  Music To Walk Home By and Why Won't They Talk To Me are more of the same.  Feels Like We Only Go Backwards is a step into cosmic uplift.  Keep On Lying is the most far gone song... which leads into the most straightforwardly beaty Elephant (the second best track on this album), which is synched very nicely to the pink elephants sequence of Dumbo on the video (go see that on YouTube straightaway).  She Just Won't Believe Me makes for a great quick and messy intro to the 6:01 contemplative harpsichord-laced epic Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control.  And the closer Sun's Coming Up changes all to simple piano first half then washing into psychedelic dream. The backing band for this recording is Pond (from Australia), and their new album is just as good. Check it out.
B009SCRERI|4.0|It is very cute and I am glad they made this movie.  I let my kids watch it all the time and they love it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching Once. It's a clever take on the traditional fairytales we were told as kids.  And it's presented in an enjoyable way for adults. Two thumbs up!
B00005B1W5|5.0|The picture and sound are great!  My husband and I love to watch this over and over again.  When we have guest over we play it and they love it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A great ending to a great series. I really enjoy the trilogy, I finished all three books in less than a week!
6305781427|5.0|We first saw this on PBS and fell in love with Yanni.  Our friends want to buy a copy when we show it to them.
B005QUQP76|4.0|It took me a while to set up though because I received multiple errors when performing the mandatory firmware update. Also,  it's slightly uncomfortable for left-handed users (like me), hence the 4 stars.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Title of this review is the review. You can picture the predicament, but reading about the husband -  wife and father - son struggles, makes one not care about the outcome.  Melodramatic. Watch Beautiful Boy instead
B0046W5E0Y|4.0|I am not generally a fan of the Disney girly princess stuff (not that the movies are all bad, but the merchandising is awful), so I was prepared to dislike this movie, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by it.  There is a pretty good story line, attractive animation, and some nice themes about friendship, kindness, bravery, and believing in yourself even when others don't believe you.  The little girl in the movie is kind and imaginative, and Tinkerbell is depicted as a smart problemsolver with a good scientific/mechanical mind, and loyal and caring to boot.  Plus, of course, the movie has enough magic and fancy to keep young kids fully engaged.  My 4 year old daughter ate this up, and she is now dreaming of being a fairy rather than a princess, which is a refreshing change of pace (in our house, the princess thing seems to be all about putting on a fancy dress and looking pretty [sigh], while the fairy-based imaginative play involves flying, nature and animals, building shelters to get ready for the winter or the rain, being magic and rescuing people, etc.--much more interesting).
B00AHXDECG|4.0|I wasn't 100% sold on Doo Wops &Hooligans, I felt it sounded too much like a demo, too many fillers for a 10 song album, and left much to be desired. But he improved with Jukebox, another album that is geares towards a fuse of many genres such as Pop, Rock, and Soul, pretty much aiming for an MJ formula that so many try and fail to emulate these days, but this one comes quite close. Standout tracks are 80s Corvette cruiser-Moonshine (which I think is his best song EVER), 2013's \\"Someone Like You\\"- When I Was Your Man, which will probably score a 2014 Record of the Year nod, the 70 vintage rocker lead single Locked Out of Heaven, and rollercoaster heartbreak song-Natalie. But pretty much every single stands out to a good degree, which is hard to do when you make short albums, on his next effort, I would like to see at least two more cuts on it just to add a bit more to the ride. Some are already jumping broom and giving him the Michael hat, which I think they shouldn't do. But if he makes more albums like this in the future, he will be setting a benchmark in pop music.
B00139XTG4|4.0|i said all i hve to say in my origina statement.... i know mr. groh read and thought it was a cery good book.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|A great trip down memory lane at this blessed time of year -  hadn't read Dickens since high school in the '60s, so it was a GREAT re-visit!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Best best best best one of the series! Me and my husband both loved it! We were on the edge of our seats and at the same time it was funny. We thought that the bad guy was the best one by far through out the series, the one from the first movie can't compare haha. It was awesome being able to see young Agent K. They picked the perfect guy for him! The end was crazy! Loved it! I'm  planning on buying the DVD we liked it so much!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed the details about the different Religion choices Pi experienced at such a young age.  The movie focused more on the adventure but I recommend the book for a deeper, more detailed look into the life of Pi.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|Loved it, saw it first in the in the movie theater with my husband our mind was blown. We rented it a few times since, that way we could understand things as there happening and catch up a little lol .
B0076DELIG|3.0|I like the Harry Bosch series. This is another good adventure. Some have been better than this one. But I liked it.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Great formula: get ALL the aging action stars together and have at it again.  They're obviously having fun and it comes across.  I love the not-so-veiled references to prior fan favorites.  Make no mistake: these guys still &#34;got it&#34; in the action dept.
B001GE6L0M|5.0|This is possibly the greatest musical purchase that I have ever made.  It is an awesome body of work and I love listening to the entire concert.  It may also be one of, if not the best, &#34;live concert&#34; albums ever produced.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Review:<br />Waste of money! Bad acting.Very unbelievable fight scenes. You can actually see the extras/stuntfighters pausing so that Batman/Batgirl can do their thing. If this goes on sales for 99 cents, you'd still pay to much.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Kid loves it!  Looks well made and can't go wrong with the price.  Hopefully it will last a good bit, as the kid loves to lose pieces left and right.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|Even for someone born in 1946, this is an eye-opening education. And tremendously readable. If you like David Halberstam, you'll really like this.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|So I have been lifting consistently for about 4 years.  Usually train with massive guys, a few of which are scientifically enhanced and I always wonder how they are making gains and I'm doing the exact same workouts they are, and staying the same.  Filling out muscles here and there but strength is relatively the same.  The magazines are total BS.  How can you expect to do the same thing a pro bodybuilder does and get the same results.  They recover 1,000 times faster than you do.  Mike lays out everything in this book in a super easy to read and understand format.  You have to do a little leg work with the diet, but I mean c'mon, take 30 minutes and figure out your nutrition plan.  After all, it's your health and your life.  I will definitely be following his advice for the coming months and based on my experiences I am pretty sure that this new way of lifting/eating will help me reach my goals.<br /><br />-Jeff
1451696191|5.0|She loves this book. Sha asked for it a while ago and I got it for her recently. It has made her happy
B0024F08UG|5.0|I originally watched this movie when it first was released. After marrying my husband, who is a firefighter, I really appreciated the movie more. Good story line and good acting.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|I thought there was a crudeness about this book that took the romance out of it. I didn't think the characters gelled. It passed in a wet weekend for me.<br />It came across as a cheap version of Fifty Sheades of Grey.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app is very entertaining and fun. The instructions are no where to be found so you have to figure out how to play on your own but once you do, you can't stop.
B008602KQI|5.0|Bought on Amazon for someone else.  Great movie. Greater book. NOT a children's story. But the whole series is great.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved the way the story went back and forth in time.  It is a book that is hard to put down.
0792844890|4.0|Typical Mel Brooks parody.  Very funny, very slapstick.  Great cast.  Good connection to Star Wars and Empire. Love it and recommend.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This was required when my other charger failed.  The original charger is no longer available.  Ad for this does not specifically state it can be used on the Kindle Fire I.  The customer service agent had to help me.
B000ID37KO|3.0|Tippi Hendren may have spent her career fighting off Hitchcock's advances but one has to wonder why he was so entranced by her. Rod Taylor does his usual good job and the bird sequences are indeed scary but I would not call this one of Hitche's best.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I like the Angry Birds a lot, but Piggies didn't do it for me -  maybe the next one will be better
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Overall good, but too many unconnected themes to make the movie believable. Would be interested to see a sequel though...
1433524619|5.0|I feel this Bible, or any other study Bible for that matter, is essential for the Christian who really wants to delve deeper into the Word of God and get more out of it. I know for me, I felt I wasn't getting the most out of the passages and books I was reading; this study Bible really does its best to squeeze out the most from every word to help the reader understand just what exactly is going on. Background information before every book, images, and countless footnotes are provided which are extremely helpful. Many times the footnotes and commentary exceed the actual text itself, and while the notes can be overwhelming, you learn to find a balance between reading text and referring to the commentary. The commentary, again, clears so much up and I can't imagine just how much time and work went into this book. I personally think it's definitely worth the price and I'm so thankful for the commentators of this study Bible.<br /><br />As for the product itself, I intentionally ordered the personal size. It is indeed more portable and easier to carry, but the size of it is still rather awkward to keep in a backpack. But hey, having this much commentary and insight into the Word of God is worth it. The pages for the Bible are very, very thin; in retrospect, I would have paid more and bought a sturdier ESV Study Bible with thicker pages.<br /><br />I chose the ESV because it really is reliable and true to the original text of the Bible. The ESV is becoming more prominent, especially in Reformed churches, and I trust the translators of this version. I know countless people who use the ESV and they recommended it along with this product. I would definitely recommend this Bible to anyone who yearns to know more of God and His Word.
B0092QITO2|5.0|VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED... AND I LOVED THE ORIGINAL! __ I admittedly had very low expectations... I knew this would either be really good (and a pretty \\"original\\" take, compared to what most remakes end up being)... or it was going to be simply God-Awful trash that I'd have to wash my eyes out with a screening of the original immediately afterward, just to get my memories wiped-clean (hopefully)... Thus, I waited until it was rentable...<br /><br />Now, I'm sorry I waited. __ This 'remake' is AWESOME! (and I'm not a big Farrell fan either, so me saying that, says a lot)<br /><br />Sure, it doesn't have the same impact it would have, if I'd never seen the original... and sure, there are elements I really miss... BUT... Mr. Wiseman seems to have done the unthinkable: He managed to make an Astounding(ly original) Remake, while respecting the original; but not regurgitating it so much so, that you can still enjoy BOTH... Like, Unintended Sequels / Chapters... or, Rekall Memory Implants, given to 2 different people; but who selected the same \\"secret agent\\" base-formula!<br /><br />Honestly, I don't see why so many people are bashing this, who profess to love the original... unless they went in completely biased; and never gave the film an honest chance.  I just purchased the blu-ray online; and can't wait 'til it gets here! -- 'Till then, \\"Mind-Bending Edition\\" Original, here I come!<br /><br />As for those who say this is \\"way better\\" than the original.... Yeah, I can't agree with that one.  It is As Good As; but it's not \\"better\\". __ Most of those reviews are coming (understandably) from 15 to 25 yr olds I'm betting; and only feel that way because of the CGI vs Practicle/Miniature-Effects; and of course, the Supreme Hotness (Biel/Beckensale) vs Old Hotness (Stone/Ticotin(?)).  ---  LOL, don't get me wrong, when it was made, Stone was hot; but even so, the age of nearly both Biel & Beckensale combined; and she, even in my opinion, can't touch the hotness, or acting ability, of either Biel or Beckensale.... and while I love Arny in the original, his acting isn't even on the same planet (ha-ha) as Farrell's... and don't forget what I said about Farrell earlier!  ...But I digress, LOL.  Rent it, Buy it, whatever... as long as you give it a chance, you'll enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have ever read!! I was crying and smiling through out. I couldn't wait to buy catching fire
B005RDF2RG|5.0|Although I still remember pretty much all of the jokes in the movie, I still thoroughly enjoyed watching it again.
1552095258|5.0|I am looking forward to using this book to make me and my family a conoe for our summer trips up many different waterways.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|In case eariler &#34;Bourne Series&#34; films stirred your curiosity (as it did mine) concerning OTHER agent-members of the clandestine super-secret group of which Jason was a member - this film becomes the &#34;cracked-open door&#34; allowing such illumination.  The story, as is true with all of Robert Ludlum's created &#34;Jason Bourne&#34; character writing skills, taken up by Tony Gilroy is consistent with what we have come to expect in this series - and, the viewer is not disappointed.  Action a-plenty - and &#34;I-can-believe-it&#34; choreography; Acting abilities of all the major (and a couple of minor) &#34;stars&#34; is commendable.  AND the reality of the two major characters inter-actions are consistent (in my estimation anyway) of what intimacies would most likely transpire between two persons in like (or similar) circumstances as those depicted in the story/film.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film, which will no doubt be the catalyst for a long line of sequels - and, if those future productions are as good as this one is ... I'm looking forward to them.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|This has the potential to be a great app. Great design and all, except it keeps freezing. When that happens, I have to close out of it and start my projects all over again. I hope the bug gets fixed soon, very frustrating. Otherwise, it's great when it actually works.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I enjoyed the magic of this DVD. I would recommend it to every one (all ages will enjoy this story)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love the mix of horror, religion, pop culture, politics, feminism and sex - and it's just plain fun.  Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe should all win Emmys.
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|I already liked this movie and this dvd was in excellent shape and a pleasure to watch...it is a great story if you don't mind facts and you can accept facts as they are.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you like zombies you will like this show. Season 3 is full of twists and turns. There is a cliffhanger at the end of each episode to keep you coming back next week.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|It just a sex book  and it takes 4 chapter to finish it I kept trying  hoping would get better  but it didn't<br />I got all 3 books but 1/2 of one was enough
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|If you are a fan of his other work, you will not be dissapointed.  McDormand, Murray, Willis and Norton give good support, plus two kids that pull at the 'ol heart strings a bit.  For a moment there it was sort of like &#34;Blue Lagoon&#34; on acid.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|The movie it self is great and the movie arrived earlier then the delivery date so that was a plus only thing I didn't like was that the case is cheap so that's why its a 4stat
B009FOBMBI|5.0|This is an amazing album and Amazon is a much better deal giving you the individual mp3's vs Apple iTunes album (beware!)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book will suck you in, hurl you around, and then spit you back out, all the while never wanting to see it end.  I was hooked from page one.<br /><br />Sky and Holder smolder with intensity.  The development of this story will have you guessing and believe me when I say, \\"you will never see it coming.\\"  The story did not seem rushed nor does it feel drug out. You will feel every angst ridden moment right along with them.  Colleen Hoover weaves a story that really does seem to connect all the dots and yet is cognizant of the delicate nature of what is being tackled.<br /><br />There is an almost surreal quality to the ease at which Ms. Hoover, pulls this story together.  Don't let the title fool you, Hopeless will leave you feeling anything but hopeless.
0345803485|1.0|The writing is atrocious. It gets repetitive and the plot and character development is lackluster. I didn't realize this book was Twilight fan fiction until halfway through the novel. I didn't like Twilight but this is infinitely more horrible.
159413586X|5.0|Loved this series.  My granddaughter had the first two copies, I just had to get the last one.  It arrived quickly, was in good shape, and I read it the same afternoon.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Riveting story and superb characters make for an enjoyable book. Action with a little romance added in.  I couldn't put it down!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this alot I can keep up with the weather here and where my daughter<br />lives up north. Very happy with it.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Not your typical comedy by any means but good for laughs.  Would have given three and a half stars and would recommend to friends.
B0091VTNZC|5.0|Modern Christmas classic blah blah blah blah blah blah minumum word requirement will ensure I never review another purchase blah
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is a well beloved movie amongst most in our family.  Would highly recommend.  Very close to the Broadway version.
030758836X|1.0|The book had a very slow begining and I found it difficult to get through the first half.  Being part of a book club, I had to finish it, it felt like a job.  The ending was terrible.  I don't recommend this book, and it is not worth the money. I have read 99 cent books better than this one.
0691142165|5.0|I'm a finance book junkie, and this is one of the better books for both entertainment value and perspective.  UNlike most flavor-of-the-month books on financial advice or the latest crisis, this is a timeless book that will still be a good read fifty years from now, if not even better. :)
0792164903|5.0|I think its the best Sleepy Hollow ever!!!!  Acting is superb!  This will be a classic.  Of course, Johnny Depp is always good.
B003RV43X4|4.0|I like this remake.  The graphics are mcuh better than the original and the story remains the same, but fills in more detail.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was so well done.  Having lived in England among that &#34;set&#34; I appreciate it soooo much.  Takes me back!  M
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|if you are in the mood for an action movie, you could do much worse.  I gave it three stars because it didn't hold my interest all the way through like the first one did.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is very handy to have this app on my Kindle. I like having it at my fingertips, and I am ready to connect at a moments notice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading this a lot. Very engrossing...couldn't put it down until I finished! :) Recommended if you like good literature.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I have listened to the CD on repeat for the last month! I like other things by this artist but I love this CD soooo much more!!
B005KR6OBM|1.0|The movies arrived on time, but upon opening them we could tell they were not a very good quality. Sure enough the first disc would not play a couple of episodes. We checked every disc and they got progressively worse as the seasons went on so that by the last season we had the disc would not even work at all. Needless to say we contacted the seller who did not respond, so we had to get Amazon involved. Thankfully with Amazons help we got a refund and were able to buy the movies from a decent seller, whose stuff actually works.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I have been waiting for an album like this since Mumford's release album. It makes my heart happy! The Lumineers are the type of musicians that deserve recognition for their art. I'm not surprised to see how popular they have grown this last year. I think many people miss authentically talented musicians.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Got this for free.  The story was not very believable but it is a fun read and it is not very long.
B0042UGMYW|4.0|I thought that this was a great film.  One gets tired of blood and gore after awhile and it is refreshing to just lose yourself into a fantasy that ends well for a change.  I thought Amanda Crew was outstanding, even though the film was supposed to revolve around Zac and his brother I do not think that it would have worked at all without her.  She showed emotion but did not overdo it...whereas I thought Efron except in one place did not show hardly any emotion.  Now maybe this was the idea of the film that he was wounded by the loss of his brother and therefor &#34;numb&#34; to life .<br />There were &#34;holes &#34; in the film also.  After a brief part for Zacs mother she disappears from the film as does<br />Tess's mother.  I just think that part was unrealistic and left kind of an empty spot.<br /><br />It was a very good story and....I would sail off into the sunset with Amenda anytime.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a touching book that EVERY dog lover must read!  It's that simple. It's truly the perfect book.  I know better what my own dog Beau is thinking.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|A good movie to watch if your looking to kill some time.<br />..............would not watch again........A one hitter quitter......not for kids  ...
B00884GR0W|1.0|This is just a copy of minecraft! This is just a copy of minecraft! This is just a copy of minecraft! This is just a copy of minecraft!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Entertaining story line filled with creepy games and puzzles. Well worth the download. Can't wait to see what they put out next.
B00926J3K6|5.0|If you are a fan you need this!!! DGM has been sold out of this for while now.... Wonderful music and packaging.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a fan of horror shows or movies.  In fact, I intentionally stay clear from them. But I was told what a Great show the Walking Dead.  Through my hesitation I sat I watched it from Episode 1 Season 1.  And after a few episodes, I was hooked.  I am now caught up and awaiting its' newest episode in February.  Great Show, Great script...I still find myself looking away when it gets bloody.  But it's like looking at the Sun - I have to stare at it.....&#34;Two Zombie Thumbs up&#34;
B009LROCJI|3.0|Music is quite interesting, but there is a skip in the first track. Is this the recording or the cloud?
B009E20IB6|4.0|Bosch is the best and he never changes. Persistence is a great asset for a survivor. Bosch's world becomes more real and full with every read.
B003XKRO9E|5.0|I'll leave the music review to someone else... but I wouldn't have bought this on vinyl if I didn't think it was amazing.  :)<br /><br />The vinyl pressing of this album sounds exceptional.  So many new records today are very poorly engineered, but this was a pleasant exception.  The sound is full and clear, bass is perfectly balanced -- there's no distortion or mistracking that I've been able to hear.  The dynamics going from soft, acoustic to loud bass and drums is flawless.  Being very familiar with the DVD-A copy of this, there's nothing lost at all.  It has all of the fullness and presence of a high-quality digital recording and all of the warmth and organic sound of vinyl.<br /><br />One of the best new vinyl purchases I've ever made.
B004S9AK7C|3.0|I have read every Ken Follet book and enjoyed them all but found this quite heavy going with so many characters I had trouble keeping up. Certainly not his best work
B009K0OTVM|5.0|I'm a romantic comedy girl through and through. I usually refuse to watch anything else. I'm not exactly sure how I started watching this tv show but before the first episode was over I was hooked. This has got to be my favorite tv show that I have ever watched. I will watch this again and again and never get tired of it. It has something for everyone: Romance, drama, comedy, action, suspense... I hope this tv show has a long journey ahead of it. I would hate to see it end after only two seasons. I beg the writer/director to keep it up. Thank you for giving everyone such a great show. I haven't been this excited about tv in years. Great actors too
0307592731|2.0|The author attempts to leave behind the loss of her mother and some destructive personal habits by solo-hiking a large portion of the Pacific Coast Trail (PCT).  The tale is mostly uninspiring, however, and there are *much* better modern personal journey books than this.  I suppose that troubled readers, more so females, will disagree with me but there is just not much here.  It appears that the author wrote the book many years after her trip and it shows in that some of the details are missing or just glossed over.  For example, first night out on the PCT, solo, she just pitches her tent and wakes up the next morning.  That's it?  The occasional history segments she offers seem to be inserted later, with little relevance to her actual trip.  If the hike cured her admitted bed-hopping tendencies or appetite for drug experimentation, I sure didn't get that message from this book.  Fine you say, must the book have an epiphany? No, it doesn't but then this book should be more positioned as \\"Attractive female hikes the PCT solo and keeps a diary.\\"
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I like both 1 and 2 hopes there is a 3 Best show on tv<br />like it a lot and cant wait for 3
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I have watched this couple of times with almost an year apart. Watching Dark knight for a movie buff like me is like a treat.<br />This has a great starcast too. Portrail of bad or evil without using much of voiloence is<br />a hard thing to do. Both Nolan and Heath ledeger have done extraordinary job at that.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Amazon streaming was the best I have experienced.  The Good Wife is my favorite television drama, interesting characters and excellent acting.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|I'm not a diver, but I use this watch in the pool 5 days a week. No problems. Easy to read, even through goggles. Looks great, good size, and comfortable.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is definitely worth watching. If you liked Monster's Inc you will love this...so many cute characters like Boo. And plenty of humor!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|A little disappointed.  Seth MacFarlane never misses on Family Guy.  This film was not as funny as a regular episode of that weekly program.
B00004ZDVQ|1.0|When this CD arrived it was NOT the 2CD version - it was Original Musiquarium 1 VOLUME 1 - very disappointed and a waste of money.<br /><br />NOTE: The item I purchased was provided by a 3rd party seller and was NOT the item this review links to on Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|My son 8, and my daughter 7 they both love this game. I had to installed in two devices so they don't have to wait for turns. Thank you, for those who are always working on such a good games.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />J.Urbina
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Great Movie!! Have loved this movie for a long time. If you are looking for a great family Christmas movie,<br />then I would recommend this one!!
B008EZVNO0|1.0|Van used to be alive . He used to put out great records and do great shows . But he is lost in California movie soundtrack pseudo jazz for most of this disc .  Plus , maybe he's got bad dentures , but his singing gets more & more garbled as time goes by . It is not that you have to sound that way just for aging .Some folks have said this disc is a \\"phone-in\\" . Would that it were so . I think he believes in this & that is more disturbing . Notice that his lyrics are becoming more & more distant from the poetry of his years ago recordings . Sad .
B003F5NSTW|4.0|I struggled at first to read this book. I just couldn't get into the story for the first 35% of the book. However, I persevered and I'm so glad I did because the end was intriguing and so sad.<br /><br />I don't know what was wrong with me at the start. I just didn't like Kevin's mum. I thought she was just so whiney and unlikeable and I found the letters awkward and confusing. However, as the book develops and you realise what a demon child Kevin is and as the pieces of the puzzle start falling into place it becomes a gripping, poignant story.<br /><br />I'd love to give this book 5 stars because it made quite an impression on me but I have to take away a star because of my feelings about the start of the book. It's the type of book that you should read again bacause everything is clear. Definitely worth a read. If you're like me just persist.
0062103377|5.0|Gift for my son! Hope he likes it, which I'm sure he will. We all love this show, Supernatural!!! Thanks
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like this app with the exception of the navigation between boards, settings, etc.  I got stuck on just a list of my boards &amp; when I was finally able to get out of them, I was getting everyone's pins, not just the people I follow.  I had to reboot my Kindle HD to get it working right again.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|The author is a Harvard neurology professor. She brings her knowledge and understanding of this debilitating disease as a gift to share the story of Alice, a Harvard linguist who has early onset Alzheimer's.  The story is beautifully and compassionately shared. It is required reading in a Cognitive Psychology class I teach and should be required for all who know someone suffering from Alzheimer's or who just want to know more.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I had heard how great this movie was, but until you actually see it you won't fully understand why. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as always as well as Zooey Deschanel. This movie can get annoying if you can relate or just get frustrated with the characters choices, but the movie is still something I would recommend and watch again.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The series is very well written with an excelent cast. There are MANY surprises that keep my interest. I can't wait until the next episode.
B000HF0IIC|3.0|Better than Batman and Robin, but the Christopher Nolan trilogy is the way to go when it comes to Batman movies.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|I liked it. Not the greatest movie I ever saw but it kept me entertained. I never got bored and, trust me, I've watched plenty of other \\"better\\" movies where I kept glancing at the clock in hopes they would be over soon. Not so with this one. A little silly, mildly humorous, not hilarious, nothing profound, but good clean fun anyway.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|If you're already into this show then you'll love this. If you haven't started watching this show for some reason, then start watching now!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This alarm clock has a lot of great features and I like it.<br /><br />However, I've switched to using the clock from from Social & Mobile instead (sorry).  It does NOT have all the features of Alarm Clock Xtreme that I like, but I really really like what I call the Bed Side Clock display.  Improve the display and I'll switch back.
1401937519|5.0|I read this book just a few weeks before my mother died.  This book changed my outlook on death.  I have not suffered as much grief as i thought I would.  I have shared this book with friends that have cancer or know someone who has cancer and it is changing their lives also.  I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about death and more specifically what we are going to experience on the &#34;other side&#34;.  This book is an easy read and Anita has a talent for explaining things.  Fabulous Book.
B004EKCNMA|1.0|I've seen other versions of A Christmas Carol and this one is not good.  Very scary. My kids did not  like it at all, and we know the story. Too much left out, dialogue hard to hear... yuck, yuck, yuck. Don't bother. Go rent A Christmas Carol starring George C. Scott.  Now THAT is a good movie.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The only entertaining part was that Batman got his ass kicked through the entire movie. Ann Hathaway was really hot.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The Colorized version of this Classic will better hold the attention of young viewers and truthfully added to my viewing enjoyment with background images I had never noticed before.And still includes the original B&W that has been a Family holiday tradition since birth. It was so overplayed on network T.V. for so long that now it is uncommon to see it broadcast at all in the whole season.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille is one of my favorite authors - always on the watch for a new one. This one, The Panther, was no exception.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|great musicality, wonderful rhythm and energy, makes you want to get up and move, or sing along, or just celebrate life
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've played this game a few times here and there.  I just noticed where I could play it on Facebook, but I don't like having to be logged in there to play a game.  Now I can play it more often.
034580404X|5.0|This whole series was so steaming hot.  I really enjoyed reading these books.  I could not stop at just one book I had to read the entire series.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of the best PS2 games and one of the best RPGs ever is made even better on the Vita. This is the version to play if you haven't played this game yet. It was actually this game that sold me on the Vita even though I had beaten the PS2 version.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|You've got to see the movie in 3D as well!  Saw it twice and loved every minute of it.  It takes you out of yourself on an unforgetable journey into the limits of your physical and spiritual capacities and still love and compassion purvails and saves us all.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|I think the producers should have stayed with a well known cast like Del Toro, Travolta, and Hayat because the more main characters of the story just didn't do it for me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excited to read the last one! I held off reading these because of all the hyper but it's not nearly as graphic as they made it out to be.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I really tried to give this movie a chance because I have watched all the other Batman movies but I just couldn't get into this one.  I don't know if it was the darkness of the plot or the darkness of the movie itself (pitch black throughout the whole movie) but I got bored and finally turned it off after about an hour and a half.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far I'm enjoying it......some items are a little easy to find but over all its a good game.......id reccomend mystery manor to anyone who likes hidden object games
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I was glued to my tv up to the last minute of the movie. Very entertaining. I liked it better than the first one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's fun an easy to play. I like the features in that I can customize the background and the back of the cards.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Wonderful music and it is very nice that I do not have another CD lying around, it is all electronical!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|But after reading good reviews, decided to give it a shot. Great premise and a very good book. With his other books, I often had problems with the endings, but it was perfect in this book. And like all other King classics, this one caused a few drowsy days at work after not getting enough sleep the night before.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I felt the movie lacked the feel of the first three Bourne movies, which I loved all of those. They kept you on the edge of your seat, while Bourne Legacy was kind of thin on the plot and could have used just a little more...ummmm...&#34;magic&#34; in the movie.
B00027JYLC|5.0|The fact this film was basically re-mastered and had additional material made it perfect for my Sociology class when we were in a section on discrimination and how sub-groups form and support each other.  I always loved the ending.  I think in the original it was even more graphic but they changed it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Loved it! Great movie and would watch it again and again. I can't wait until they come out with the box set. I don't buy dvds or blue-rays, but I might make an exception.
B005HP2J66|4.0|This is exciting to see this cave, but the film seems to really drag in the beginning and also since there were no flutes found in the cave the section on that seemed out of place.  If it was down to just about 50 minutes it would be perfect.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Works great! This app is a quick and easy reference for the weather. It's fast and as accurate as any weather service can be. Now if only I can get the weather to cooperate :)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First person account was really needed because of all the confusion in the media about what happened and with the film coming out soon.  Very good inside account.  Thanks Mark.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This was such a great! A really good story and an interesting film. I would definitely recommend it for anyone!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Glad I deleted weather channel app which would often not load and chose this one that I view each day and look also for week forecast.<br />Feel this will also be helpful when traveling.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|James Taylor is my all-time favorite musician/singer/songwriter. An entire album of Christmas songs is perfect at this time of the year. Every song puts me in a holiday mood. I highly recommend this album. I just love it.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|A good read, filling in some of the back story, having read more recent works by Jo Nesbo. At times it did feel as though it was a tour through some of Sydney's tourist destinations. Some nostalgia with the boxing, because as a child I was fascinated by the boxing troupe run by Jimmy Sharman which did the rounds of the country shows throughout Australia.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Love this movie, a must see for all comic character lovers. Watch it in theater and rented it. I will be purchasing this movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved Season 1. Love Season 2 even more. Fantastic performances and great story line that will keep you guessing - 5 stars on 'creep factor.' Highly recommend it if you like horror stories. Can't wait for Season 3!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This is a great Romeo and Juliet story set in NYC. Great dancing, singing and acting! What more could you want?
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Great band, perfect sound quality, and very easy and fast download. One of their best albums. Has &#34;Good Time&#34; and &#34;Shooting Star&#34;
1401322786|5.0|Love purchasing items on Amazon, but espeically love buying books.  I have a Nook, but I still like to be able to hold a real book and read it.  Guess I will always be a little &#34;old school&#34;.<br />Recieved my book in 5 days.  Have come to expect excellent service from Amazon and I have never been disappointed.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Good when there's some down time in your life. Only 4 stars because of the sounds, limited amount of levels. Quite addicting and engaging and easy to play. Good powers ups and boss levels as well.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was a very disappointing mystery/thriller. The entire plot was lame only to be surpassed by a terrible ending. It was a total waste of time and money.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope, my grandchildren love playing it!  They argue who is going to play it next! Eben the grown ups find it challenging.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Will Ferrell and director John Favreau  work together well in this possible holiday staple.  I say possible because it hasn't had time enough to earn that title.  If it becomes an annual tv network holiday movie then it's well on its way.  With a cast that includes Ed Asner as Santa, Will Ferrell as Buddy the elf, James Kahn as his scrooge like father, Mary Steenbergen as his mother and the great Bob Newhart as his adoptive father (and narrator) this production really can't go wrong.  Sure, it falls short on occasion but it has lots of heart.  It is now in my limited collection of holiday/Christmas movies, along with It's A Wonderful Life and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (A Christmas Story will never belong to that collection).  Check out the brief but hilarious performance of Game of Throne's Peter Dinklage as uppity Children's book author Miles Finch.
B009ZE27US|1.0|ok guys how does a app know first of all and it just wants you to have some humeri dub at lest its free and you can always get rid of it
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Men in black is a Great way to spend an afternoon...good movie...hallarious comedy..great family movie....highly recommended for all age groups.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|A good fun read with characters I cares about.<br /><br />Scalzi is one of the more interesting authors at present working in Sci-Fi. He may be a little camp, but that is a great part of the genre.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This move had a great moral to the story, kept me absorbed in it the whole time, well worth the rent.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|You really don't need to pay for this one, unless the between stage ads are really annoying to you. This is one of the best Angry Birds though... they do a great job on the music and including the Stars Wars weapons with the birds.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I found it hard to work.  Haven't had much chance to try it out. Anxious to get to work with it.  It's okay
B00AA7O22U|4.0|it was a great movie. I would tell everyone to watch it you will not be sorry. enjoy it ok
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I always seem to have my headset with me, but I don't always need to have it on me.  So most of the time it would end up in my purse or pocket.  I would worry about how I placed it in, so I didn't break.  Now I just put it in my case and it's safe and secure.  It also doesn't get lost in my purse or pocket, much easier to find when I need it.  I don't know why I waited so long to get one!
B00170DEM8|5.0|This movie always make the holidays feel more special. I love the singing and dancing of Bing and Fred. It's a tradition I've had since I was a child. I'm so glad amazon had it to watch instantly.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|I bought this for my great-nephew's 2nd birthday.  He absolutely loves it.  I like that it can be used indoors so he can shovel his toys into his toy box and he likes to play in the gravel area out in the yard.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|after seeing the film &#34;lincoln&#34;, which is one of spielberg's best, i had to read &#34;Team of Rivals&#34;. i was not in the least disappointed. great insight, easy read, in short, lovedit.
0345525558|5.0|THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS - I am very happy to have read The Language of Flowers....and pleased with the way the book arrived.  I have loaned my book to our local florist.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like that you get to play with players from all over and not just against yourself, however you don't win bingo often and its almost impossible to fill in the puzzle map in each city. Also you should be awarded with more daily bingos. Some of the citys you can only play once with the amount they give you.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I loved this book. I liked the ending but found I needed more closure. He storms off and then realizes he knew she hadn't told the secret and nothing else is mentioned? Could have been done better. But a great read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's not his best, but it is very entertaining.  Like many of Flynn's books it seems to end a little abruptly.
B0046B3QTG|1.0|Unfortunately, I downloaded the movie and was unable to watch the entire movie due to it got stuck and would not move beyond that point.
B00A4TKDKY|2.0|I love Buddy Guy, but this CD should have an explicit rating for there is an f-bomb in the introduction.  Furthermore, the sound quality is poor.  Not what you'd expect from a live cd in 2012.
B00A5052YE|4.0|I think there are some bright parts in this album.  Alicia Keys is an extremely talented artitst.  She possesses the ability to produce complex pieces boardering jenious.  Her only drawback is her loyalty to her hip-hop connections.  Niki Minaj did not add anything to Girl on Fire in my opinion, but maybe I am just gettig old.  I would love to see Alicia produce a novelty album of just her more complex pieces.  Just throw it all out there I think we will be impressed at the genious that is Alicia Keys.
