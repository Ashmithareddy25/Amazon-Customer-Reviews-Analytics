B00979CS50|4.0|I guess this is all we can expect from Neil at this age - rambling guitar and simple (mostly meaningless) words.  Don't get me wrong, this is better than 99.9% of the garbage that is put out these days.  Was hoping for a classic, but will gladly take this, a relatively minor yet solid work - and crank it up!  Don't care much for Born in Ontario - a very weak song, but the rest of the songs are fine and Driftin Back, Ramada Inn, Twisted Road, She's Always Dancing and Walk Like A Giant are terrific!  Walk Like A Giant could end about 2 minutes earlier or keep it rockin'.
B003Y5HWGI|1.0|We had the same issue as others here.  The fourth and fifth disc are the same, even though the fifth disc is labeled as such, it is a repeat of the fourth disc.  I purchased the first seven seasons as part of my wife's Christmas gift.  We live out of the country and have been watching the series as time, weather and circumstances dictate.  So several months into the year we have worked our way to the end of the seventh season and deja vu hits.  We never do see how the season ends.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I liked the book because the author gave us an inside look into the hazards of being in the military. He understandably could not go into great detail, but he pushed up to the line of what he could and could not say. The book was a page turner for me. Very well written by a novice author (that was meant to be a compliment). If you enjoy military non-fiction you will love this book.

1439127700|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The President's Club\\". I'm glad I read it at this time because it showed that our politicians aren't always as bad as we fear - especially now! Of course, I was surprised at some of the ones who were somewhat worse than I thought. And some of the least likely candidates bonded in the afterlife of the Presidency. The Bush's even call Clinton their brother.  When Clinton posed for a family picture with them, he commented that \\"every family has to have a black sheep\\".<br /><br />Some of the stories are humourous (Clinton & the Bush's) and some are heartwarming.  More than one or two are aggravating and some are surprising.  My views on some of our former president's changed.<br /><br />The book shows that most of our president's tried hard to do the right thing (with an exception here and there) - both while in office and sometimes even more afterward.  I'm glad I read it.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Seriously, Don's cover of Out Of The Ghetto alone is worth the price of the CD.  This album is EXCELLENT, front-to-back and top-to-bottom.  Don may be getting older (as he reminds us in several of these songs)but he hasn't lost any of his lyrical edge or musical chops.  Every song is at once very familiar yet incredibly fresh.  How does he do that?<br /><br />If you like Steely Dan or Don's previous albums, I promise this album will thrill you.

B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I can overlook a bit of departure from reality in the name of eliminating some tedium from a film, but egads!<br /><br />  Here's the trouble.  None of the characters are introduced to us in any real way, and what scant development exists, only makes the viewer want to root for the aliens. Because we don't care about any of these people, there is no real tension when they are in danger.  The mission itself is evidently not understood by the writers themselves.  The childish and obnoxious \\"good\\" scientists want to go meet our alien creators, but once launched, the mean, evil commander says that they have a different agenda, and that no one will be making contact with any aliens. Repeat---there will be absolutely NO contact with the aliens.  They then land and immediately set off to go make contact with the aliens.  Plumbing the depths of the alien catacombs, they remove their protective helmets and start grabbing hold of anything that looks deadly or poisonous with the gloved hands so that they can gauge the gooiness of the strange material, and inspect the snottyness level by spreading their fingers apart and seeing how stretchy it is.  The android figures out how to use the buttons and he plays them all a hologram of the aliens running around and getting their head caught in  a door.  They then open the door and bag up the head  so that they can poke at it back on the ship. Due to their impeccable scientific protocols they observe, the head only falls off their dune-buggy once on the way back to the ship.  But they accidentally nuke it anyway, so. . .<br /><br />  It gets dumber. A scientist gets killed because he sees a hissing, sputtering snake like thing, and he starts cooing at it, and tries to pet it like it was a retriever puppy (watch the movie if you don't believe me.)  An evil but aging rich guy who is hoping to find some kind of life extending goop has stowed away on the ship and announces his desires.  This supposedly explains why the android spiked oneof the good scientist beverages with some slime and caused him to accidentally impregnate the other good scientist with a gut buster.  She removes the offensive reptile by having a serve-yourself-surgery machine make a massively intrusive incision in her abdomen and salad-thong the creature out of her. Once patched back up with a series of huge steel staples, she goes about her business, occasionally moaning to show that she's been cut open and it still hurts a bit. For some reason, she doesn't  see the need to bore the rest of the crew with details about this ordeal.  They then go to the alien ship that is somehow immured in a mountain, where they wake up an alien and ask it for life extending goop for the millionaire.  The alien shrugs off his slumber and proceeds to festoon an old fashioned tail-whooping on any human within convenient range.  The tummy surgery chick escapes and the creature tries to launch the ship to go destroy earth (we never really know why the good scientist is privy to this info).  She radios the ship who kamikaze's into the alien ship (killing most everyone) and brings it back down to the planet.  The good scientist uses the android head to hot wire another conveniently available alien ship, and she takes off to go. . .home?  No. She wants to go to the alien's home planet to find out why they want to kill us so badly. . .I'm not kidding.  I guess just going back to earth would make a sequel harder.  On this screen writing fart, the film ends.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars for visual effects and unintentional comedy.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|So sad. Decent enough game but the addition of network permissions in the most recent update sucks. What is the need for data mining in a paid app? I guess the developers think they slip the new permissions past most people in an update now that their feedback is so high.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading her first book, I couldn't wait to read the second one and can't wait till the third.  She had my attention all the time and I would try to figure out what was coming next before I got to that part.  She made is so real you could almost feel the sex between them, great imagination and well written. Her discription of the characters was so good, you could see them as you were reading the book.  I liked the way she put both characters together with each one having a specific problem and at times I thought Eva was too hard on Gideon, but then I realized now that she had too, although he did not pressure her, but she was so honest with him even though she could have lost him.

B008KOTNVA|5.0|Update August 2015: Kit is still pristine. It is used every day my multiple people. Somehow we have yet to lose or break anything. All pieces are parts still fit like new; nothing is worn out or has too much play. Awesome value to make it 3 years and still be in new condition. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />Update May 2013: Kit is still like new. Not even a chip in the paint. Really impressed by this kit. Buy one!<br /><br />Update Feb. 2013: This kit is still holding up wonderfully. It is used daily on a variety of electronics, and I've yet to break or lose anything. The case is kind of pain, difficult to open with one hand. The bits themselves show no signs of wear, which surprised me considering the amount of abuse to which they're subjected. If you're on the fence about this kit, take my word for it as a technician who depends on these tools: worth every penny if not more.<br /><br />I repair a variety of electronics at my job. When I started, we had one of these iFixIt kits floating around for everyone to share. Since everyone fought over the one kit, I picked up another set for myself. Everything is very high quality. I've used it for months on a daily basis without damaging anything in the kit. If you work on small electronics/computers, do yourself a favor and buy this set.

1426209584|2.0|I have been very interested in Birds of Paradise since childhood and was very eager to see this book. Unfortunately, virtually all of the imagery was printed with extremely saturated colors. The colors are so exaggerated that in many images, much detail on the birds are washed out. Even the brown saturation was so great, that those shades often appear bright red or orange. What an incredible disappointment.
1579128955|5.0|If you're a mathematician by trade, education or inclination - or if you just enjoy science - then the periodic table is a thing of beauty.  It puts the universe in order in a wonderful fashion, giving it a logical basis that didn't exist prior to the table's creation.  It even successfully predicted elements that hadn't been discovered.  Theodore Grey's The Elements celebrates both the periodic table and the individual elements that make it up.<br /><br />After a few introductory pages that explain how the periodic table is constructed, the book dedicates two to four pages on each element, providing a few paragraphs about the significance of the element along with some nice pictures of the element either in pure form or in a compound or in some object.  Of course, with later elements (the very short-lived elements), there is very little to show or discuss.<br /><br />For each element, Gray provides some vital statistics (like atomic weight or density) along with graphical representations of the electron distribution, atomic emission spectrum and temperature ranges where the element is solid, liquid or gas.  Fanning out the pages will show that these ranges fluctuate based on atomic number and are not merely random.<br /><br />If you are into science, this is a nice book, but it may not have all the details you'd want.  It is more of an introduction to the foundation of chemistry, something to teach newcomers with nice illustrations and often humorous text.  Despite all the versions of periodic tables he shows in the book, the one thing I found Gray omitted was a complete table showing all the elements by symbol.  Nonetheless, this is a fun and informative book that is good for all ages to learn more the stuff of which we are made.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|I was sad to hear about Khan's unfortunate departure. It was shocking to all fans, who firstly loved the band's style based on his vocals.<br /><br />Replacing a departed vocalist has never been an easy job, Iron Maiden, Queensryche, Journey they all suffered, but in the case of Kamelot Tommy Karevik is the perfect candidate.<br />Not only he fills Khan's shoes perfectly, he also adds a new depth to Kamelot.<br />The album simply is one of Kamelot's best.<br />My favorites so far are:<br />-Song for Jolee<br />-My Confession<br />-Falling Like The Fahrenheit<br />-Solitaire<br />-My Prodigal Son<br /><br />You might laugh because these are most songs, but to like this much of songs from first listens, I imagine I will love it from cover to cover when I listen to it more.

1451620829|5.0|I have to say, I love this book.  Not because I'm a Kiss fan, but from a biographical stand point.  Peter's book leads you from his childhood growing up in the streets of New York to the big time!  If you have read the book \\"Heaven and Hell\\" by ex Eagles Guitarist Don Felder, Peter's story is very similar.  As Felder called Henley and Frey \\"The Gods\\" who ran the Eagles, Criss has a real similar experience with Paul And Gene.  As business and band partners, this book, like Felder's, gives you the highs and lows of being in the glorious and sometimes cruel world of Rock and Roll!<br /><br />Peter Criss has always been my favorite KISS member, and as a drummer myself, I can relate to his challenges playing in bands with egos, craziness, good times and bad!<br /><br />Great Book! You will enjoy this for sure!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love Lee Child books -- the strong, handsome, competent man finding solutions, helping the damsel in distress, beating the bad guys, saving the country, book after book.  He travels light, not looking for trouble - but it always finds him.  I love his creative solutions and the twists and turns that evolve.  It's all action, not sexy or seductive - and that's just fine!
0307454541|2.0|Motivated by the opinions of some respectable reviewers and my current interest in international authors, I was predisposed to like the first of Larsson's trilogy. Maybe my high expectations also predisposed me to disappointment, but maybe not. My reading experience ranged from trying really hard to maintain attachment to feeling intellectually insulted. Larsson builds his mystery around the dark mind of sexually violent predators (SVP), their male and female victims and the dysfunctional family. Trying to connect with his protagonist was like chewing on styrofoam. Lisbeth, who I loved, is the intriguing figure and should have been the voice of the story. I disagree with reviewers who thought that the violent rape by her legal advocate was gratuitous. Larsson attempts to paint Lisbeth as textbook Asperger's with massive intelligence but no connection to human emotion other than her intense anger. Her lack of emotional response after the rape, other than to revenge it, is an effectual device that reveals her psychological core. Well done so far until she joins Blomkvist. Then Mikeal's mega-chic-magnetism supposedly provides the antidote for Lisbeth's syndrome. She becomes fascinated and aroused by him while I became like yeah, right. It's as believable as me (56 yo but still a Blomkvist stud...in my own mind) hooking up with disturbed teen emo-chicks. Not fantasy, absurdity. Throughout, with all due respect to those who love these books and consider them so cerebral, I found Larsson's writing amateurish and not at all intellectually stimulating. To be fair there are nuggets of insight and creativity, but these are nested within loads of trite devices, redundant descriptions, bland characters and simplistic, choppy prose delivered in sophomoric style. When an author chooses a subject as serious as the psychology of SVP and a victimized woman with Asperger's he owes the reader a serious treatment. Read Joyce's Ulysses instead.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|I'm a veteran horror movie buff, and my favorites are always the stories that are genuinely creepy, as opposed to gory and violent.  Creepy and atmospheric is what you get in this film.  I don't remember seeing any fake blood at all, even during the death scenes.  Also, I did jump, and I even squealed a couple of times, hanging on to my husband's arm for dear life.  Remember, I'm a horror movie buff.  Even movies that make me jump NEVER make me scream, but I found the images truly frightening.  If you're a person who needs violence and gore in your movies like, say, Hostel or Saw, you may not like this one.  But if you're a fan of vintage horror novels like Dracula, Wuthering Heights, The Woman In White, etc., this one might be up your alley.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Recently decided to re-read some of the classic stories from my childhood, this being one of them.  It was first read when I was under ten years of age and not since, although I seem to remember watching one movie version, a very old one, I think starring Mickey Rooney.<br /><br />I have found it almost as entertaining as I did all those years ago, with its descriptions of childhood behaviour and pranks, particularly when 'Tom' meets a new boy in town, who is much better dressed and apparently from a more 'well-off' family. The threats such as \\"my brother could thrash you, with one hand behind his back\\" etc are so amusing and it is so well written that the reader can easily take an instant dislike to this 'new kid' and be delighted when Tom eventually comes out on top, in the ensuing struggle.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed this return to my childhood and can recommend this book to adult or child.
1883217040|5.0|I have a large collection of music instructional books and The Jazz Theory Book is the best.  It goes deeply into where others leave off and cut short, and it does so with clear, simple explanations and illustrations that makes the complex discussion of advanced harmony readily digestible.  Several years ago I hesitated buying the book because of the cost and especially because it did not have a \\"look inside\\" feature.  After continuing to see great reviews I went ahead and took the chance, and am glad I did.  It is loaded with juicy tidbits of jazz history along with the harmony lesson at hand such as this: \\"Before the bebop era, most jazz musicians played the 4th of a major chord as a passing note only.  Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk and other pioneers of bebop often raised the 4th, as shown in figure 3-11, in their improvising, chord voicings, and original tunes. It's hard to believe now, but the raised 4th was a very controversial note during the 1940s.  People actually wrote letters to Down Beat magazine about it, saying things like \\"the beboppers are ruining our music\\" and \\"jazz is dead.\\"<br /><br />The only other thing I can say is that I am in no way a paid reviewer and do not benefit from the sale of this book.  As a musician, I simply feel grateful to have come across it.

B00913DPW2|5.0|The Haunt IS challenging in many ways, but to those who like to use intuitive and deductive reasoning skills, it's great fun!! I have played it twice on my Kindle Fire 7 and thought the game functioned well, despite a freeze-up, which is easy to deal with. I also have played it on my KF 8.9 and it looked/functioned super good.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game as a true walkthrough adventure. Those who need help will find lots of aid in game via Moth hints AND a link to the official walkthrough. There is  Skip option for puzzles that seem difficult, but you need to turn it on in your game options. I prefer to do as much as possible by myself first and use help minimally, b/c the whole point in playing these sorts of games is the mystery involved in not knowing anything and then discovering everything through patience and personal experimentation to solve each problem. I can hardly wait till there is another game as good as this one. It remains a great favorite of mine.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I purchased this book because I loved the Harry Potter books and so did my kids. I had high hopes, but am sorely disappointed.

Sorry, JK Rowling needs to stick to children's books.
0307743659|5.0|The first time I read The Shining was back in junior high and it terrified me. I didn't even have the image of Jack Nicholson's evil smile yet implanted in my head. The king of horror never ceases to amaze me, even the second time around. This time rereading it in my *coughs * forties *coughs* I got to fully appreciate King's talent at fleshing out his characters. Filled with subtle horror, madness and a hotel that manifests and takes on a life of its own, this tale gave me all the creepy goodness only King can deliver.<br /><br />While I cannot imagine you aren't aware of the tale or at least watched the movie, the tale centers around recovering alcohol Jack Torrance and his struggling young family. After a breakdown that cost him his teaching career, they have been struggling to make ends meet. With a car about to choke out its last dying breath, he accepts a job as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. * cue ominous music* Wendy his wife is very fragile and has seriously contemplated leaving good old Jack. Sadly she loves the loon and with a young clairvoyant son they travel with him to take up residence at the Overlook. Danny, oh poor Danny! He sees thing but is too young to articulate and shout, \\"we all gonna die if we go to that there hotel!!\\" Needless to say that as they head to the hotel * cue ominous music* with thoughts of bonding, writing and love the tale that unfolds is anything but a fairy-tale.<br /><br />King has a unique ability to create dark, flawed and believable characters that stay with you long after having read the book. My husband and I are both huge King fans and still quote lines from our favorite Stephen King novels. \\"They all float down here\\", \\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\\" \\"Get Busy Living or Get busy dying.\\" Jack Torrance is one twisted, broken, angry, demented, alcoholic recovering wanna- be. He is also charismatic, a sickly sweet talker and manipulator. While his intentions are good, somebody forgot to flip the switch on. Add in the Overlook hotel *dantdantdant*  and you have the ingredients for sheer terror. Danny loves his Mom and Dad, and gets upset when he hears bad thoughts in his parent's heads; like \\"divorce\\" and \\"suicide\\". He really doesn't understand the things he sees. That is until the creepy Dick Halloran tells him that he has his \\"shine on\\". Danny's gift is known as the Shining. (Hence the title) The hotel takes on a life of its own as it feeds on and grows stronger from evil committed on the premises. *shivers* Haunted houses have nothing on the  Overlook. It is worse than the Hotel California.<br /><br />Stephen King slowly draws you into the tale and its characters. You become completely lost in the corners of his warped mind. The lines between his world and reality blur. He slowly builds the suspense of the tale, carefully weaving in the gooey creepiness he is so well known for. Finally you reach a point where your hands are sweating, your heart is racing and there is not a chance in Haiti that you are setting this book down. His portrayal of Jack's madness was genius and so well fleshed out. Add in the hotel's growing interest in Danny and *squee* you are in the middle of a book high that will not quit! The supernatural elements only enhanced the tale as the story picked up speed. It had me racing to it conclusion. While I love many of Stephen King's work, this tale will forever be one of my favorites. He is and always will be on my auto-buy list. If you love horror, then my guess is his book(s) already graces your bookshelf.<br /><br />One of the reasons I chose to reread The Shining was because of the announcement that Stephen wrote a second book to this tale called Doctor Sleep. Scheduled to be released in 2013, it will tell the tale of a grown-up Danny Torrance and his quest to save a special twelve year old girl from a murderous tribe of paranormals. *I know right, I shivered too* The True Knot tribe lives off the \\"steam\\" that children with the \\"Shining\\" produce but only if you torture them to death!!

It consists of the record of a mescaline trip, where he was attended by a friend and his wife, and musings on the spiritual and historic uses of the drug.<br /><br />For the reader today, the book will seem quite tame and matter-of-fact, but for someone like Huxley to speak out on this drug, in his time, was quite controversial.  I did enjoy the essay though I think it suffers from a fatal flaw:<br /><br />To the already initiated user of the drug, the book is unnecessary, as the effects he describes and the conclusions he reaches are nearly universal among users I have known.  On the other hand, to the uninitiated reader, the book will read like so much nonsense.<br /><br />It is not terribly different than to try to explain a personally transcendent experience of any kind to those who have not experienced one of their own.  It was Huxley's goal to penetrate academia with this book and motivate research into what he considered a very important drug for mankind.<br /><br />The second half of the book (more or less) is a second essay, \\"Heaven and Hell\\", which discusses, basically, the transcendent nature of art (mostly) and the draw toward certain mediums, themes, and materials in history.  It is a study in philosophical idealism.<br /><br />I found that it wandered, did not well support its case, and was over-long.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its cool but you have to wait to get coins if you run out but anyway it cool and fun to play
B009DJB9HC|5.0|This is definitely a must have album for any rock n roll fan. My favorites on this album are Big Train, Common Man, Afterglow, and The Circle is just one sick ride with Hughes reminding everyone why hes called the voice of rock. Highly recommended!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Love this show and so happy to see that Amazon has this for instant download :) Tysm Amazon. The show is awesome and the quality was perfect.
B004FCEFUK|5.0|I was searching for some music as I often do using the reviewers here on Amazon to inform me and ran into Waiting in the Wings, a band I'd never heard of. However, I had some mp3 promotional credits to use and the clips sounded pretty decent. The first few spins didn't blow me away, though The AngelMaker did catch my attention, but having now spun it many times I can say this has found a pretty regular spot in the rotation for me. The music overall is very well constructed both with strong licks (especially the bass player) and quality songwriting.<br /><br />While it's not pushing the envelope in terms of originality, it's nevertheless quite enjoyable. The only thing I'd caution you about is while the album/songwriting is very good, some of the lyrics are quite cheesy and can be difficult to get through (Alley Cat -> I'm looking at you here especially). That being said, I certainly wouldn't let some cheesy lyrics here and there detract from an otherwise very solid prog album.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|we bought this app about a week ago and my son loooves it! he isn't much into the games yet but this one is a winner!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|** Updated **<br />I cannot recommend this game any longer. Teamlava has stopped creating the special holiday apps for the KF. All other platforms get them, but not us.<br /><br />This means we don't get the goals, the recipes & decor items used in those goals... nor the cool rewards. If they've stopped supporting KF, why get their game?<br /><br />Sadly, I'm going to recommend you pass Teamlava games up until they begin to support the Kindle Fire. :(
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a great book and once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down. Lots of action and romance, keeps your attention the whole time! Loved this book! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
6305428042|5.0|Best Halloween movie ever and at a great price! It came super fast and was just like watching it on the Disney channel.
B0095T3H2U|2.0|It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. I expected to be rolling on the floor in tears laughing but it's just a few laughs here and there. Not a movie I would buy but might watch if it came on TV and nothing else was on.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great family movie for a good laugh. The kids love it, grankids love it and so did we! you have to rent this
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|We enjoy sci-fi movies.<br /><br />This movie was about . . . I'm not sure.  Some of the visuals were amazing (the intro scene in particular).<br /><br />The futuristic medical technology was fascinating. In other ways, it seems to have been an attempt at delivering a storyline with some deeper meaning.  Connecting it with something associated with our understanding about our own world (and its people) or world's future, or other worlds (and its people or beings), amounted to an aggravating stretch, albeit possible.  We were waiting for a really \\"whow\\" moment beyond the medical technology scenes but it never happened.  There were times when it seemed like the delivery within certain scenes was mere unimaginative thin threads to a message.<br /><br />At other times it was a bit difficult to take the characters seriously because the script in those particular scenes were not really valuable--although ordinarily I would consider them good actors.  Perhaps the sequel will be more interesting and engaging since the Alien-looking creature which popped out in the end looked like it had somewhere to go.
B00361CAEE|4.0|I can't get enough of fashion, vogue magazine, etc. This is a cool glance into the world I work in. It is candid, fun, and shows how the biggest fashion magazine creates their biggest issue. If you are fashion girl then you will love this movie
B0084IG8TM|3.0|The movie was great, but the quality of the DVDs was atrocious.  The first disc aborted several times, the replacement played through once fine, but the second time it also aborted.  The manufacturer either used lousy equipment or substandard media.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building Your Book for Kindle is an excellent book. I found it easy to use, easy to understand, descriptive, and what I would consider a \\"Bible\\" for writers. Wish I had discovered it before I uploaded my first book to publish online.<br /><br />Catherine Coyne
B009KHDT0C|3.0|The movie was slow. The chemistry between the actors just was not there. Overall I am very glad I rented the movie and did not buy it.
B009DJB9HC|1.0|Very disappointing.  Not their best.  I loved every single song on their first 2 albums.  I like none on this one.  All songs sound like only half-heartedly made. Is this why they say this is their last album together?
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The more you see it, the more you like it.  Great FX and I hope a seuel is on the way.
142314189X|5.0|We started \\"reading\\" Rick Riordan by audio on a family vacation. Both our male and female teens have read all of his books as a result. I love the learning disability-turned-on-its head qualities of Percy, as a ADHD/Asperger's parent.
B008QOH1NG|5.0|Awesome DVD. Its shot well without the crazy jumpimg video of some live shows. Its easy to forget how hard Stryper actually rocks. These guys are a tight band with amazing lead guitar changes and massive bass lines and drum beats. If you like them at all give this dvd a try. If your not sure give it a try anyway. You will be amazed.
B008YZXYY2|3.0|I will keep this review short because i think the first reviewer had it correct.<br /><br />I really wanted to hear this album because the first two songs on it are really good; unfortunately these were the only two songs i could get into.  Maybe Corey should have concentrated his effort a little better on this album and made it a single disc (like Operation: Mindcrime or The Crimson IDOL).  Also other than some distortions and different sounds throughout, this album does not remind me much of a concept album.  Maybe Taylor and company would have been better comparing this album to Guns n Roses Use your illusion than \\"The WALL\\" which had dialogue and drama that is not found here. However that is just my opinion, you might like it.<br /><br />I still think Corey Taylor is one of the best vocalists out there. However I see him following a path of another great singer (Paul Rogers).
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I remember this book from high school and loved it. I took the time 4-5 years later to re read and I still love it! Its a quick easy read that you cant put down. You are instantly transported to this future world and the fascination to be pretty. Looking forward to delving into the next book in the series, Pretties.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is an extremely talented musician and this CD is truly a unique piece of art. The style if the music is uncommon and I love the quality of each piece. This is six/five star product that, according to the laws of mathematics, can only receive five.
B00913DPW2|1.0|This is one of the worst games ever! Don't waste your time and money on this piece of garbage. The front door would not open after you take a lock off of it, prolly was the end of the game, because thats all the programmers had time for.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this well written book.  It gives you a great understanding and appreciation for those who give their heart and soul for our freedoms.  Thank you.
B000000XB9|5.0|As we remember the past we think of CCR. After listen to it it several times I think it should have stayed in the past. We only remember the good things and forget the rest.
1455121924|5.0|I do not have any obvious sensitivity to wheat, but it all makes sense for improving your diet and your health.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed the first of the series and this continuation was also very intriguing. It satisfied the erotica fix I needed from the withdrawals I was having from the 50 Shades so I'm looking forward to the next novel in this series.
0446580848|5.0|This is a first class novel in every respect. I noticed some people gave this story a low rating because it supposedly dragged in some places when describing Yemen and its history and arab customs, etc. Wake up readers. DeMille handled the history of that country very well while engaging a great plot for John Corey and company. Next to Nightfall, this is DeMille's best novel.<br />I certainly loved this story and hope DeMille gives us another John and Kate story and perhaps, adding Paul Brenner. I give this story a bravo five stars.  Dennis
B00000DG1R|5.0|I used to listen to all these songs long ago. I have allways wanted to buy this cd. It has some great songs to listen too.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Having seen the movie on TV (with all of the commercials) we bought the DVD and were able to watch the whols movie, it was very funny.
B00111YM5G|3.0|A little too depressing, even for me! I kept expecting this movie to turn around and be better than just ok but it never did. Not a total loss though, Andy Whitfield was right for the part of Gabriel. I miss him, He had so much potential.
B004132I20|5.0|My girlfriend just gave me this series as well as series 2 for birthday presents. I'm pretty stoked because I got what I asked for. Not only as gifts, but as a fan of the show and stories. This show is immaculate on Blu-Ray. There is the original pilot and audio commentary tracks as well as a behind the scenes feature that's about 40 minutes long. I love everything about this show, the modern and contemporary setting, the actors, the cinematography, the music, everything. I think Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock Holmes since Peter Cushing and Martin Freeman is the best Watson to date. I can see why Peter Jackson cast them as Smaug the Dragon and Bilbo Baggins respectively, in his forthcoming The Hobbit trilogy. I highly recommend this to any fan of suspense thriller mysteries and well shot and acted shows. And the fact that each episode is 90 minutes is great, granted there is only three episodes a series. I cannot wait to re-watch this series.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I enjoyed the film.  Worth the purchase just to see the removed footage.  If you have a bluray player I consider this a must buy disk.
B000002IO1|5.0|I purchased this cd to replace my old Alannah Myles I wore it out. Its realie a great cd I enjoy listening to it.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|Love this show. It was cool to see them invade the prison. I am glad they are at the prison storyline arc. Great opening to this season.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Too bad this show was discontinued. A fun, action film that makes you care about the characters. Enough creativity and humor to set it apart.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love this app! this app is perfect for what I want to do with my pictures. My pictures look professional. That's all that matters to me. thanks Amazon for a good quality app.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|This is much nicer than the old battery pack I was using -- it wasn't powerful enough to charge my Kindle Fire but this product has plenty of juice to do the job. It was also cheaper than my previous battery pack.<br /><br />Instructions were well-written. Charging is relatively speedy.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to use it for an upcoming trip. This was a really good purchase.
B009FB3W9G|5.0|This will knock your socks off. The Glee performances (not all listed) were a stand out. Can't wait to relive this wonderful evening. A must for any Striesand fan, ENJOY..............
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Dang, I downloaded the first installment months ago and loved it.  Just realized 5 more \\"episodes\\" have been released since...zipped right through them.  Best sci-fi I've read!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I read this book because of the hype around about it - curious I guess. It really is a fantasy tale - \\"young inexperienced girl meets older experienced but screwed up rich man who attempts to involve  her in his sado machochistic sexual pursuits\\". There is little else to this tale - I found myself skipping over the very very long and detailed accounts of the SEX - (9/10 of the book) because it was just more of the same and the relationship pretty unbelievable. I kept at it because it really got me in - where was this relationship going?  There were the morsels of intrigue thrown in - e.g. Mrs. Robinson but not a lot of any real literary value. The ending was obviously intended to get the reader to rush out and get the second book - & I did!
B00433SVP6|5.0|I loved the Percy Jackson series, and am thoroughly enjoying this book, looking forward to reading the series. Cracking good read.
B000001GXJ|5.0|Only two things would, I think, make this better: if it were live (and we can't do anything about that - I just generally prefer live recordings, warts and all, to studio recordings), and if Cappucilli's voice were...I don't know how to explain what tiny thing I think is missing in some moments, because he's unarguably great, but the other voices on this recording are so outstanding that he's a tiny bit pale in comparison at times, particularly initially. I've never heard Freni sound more beautiful, I've loved and continue to love Van Dam's voice, and Jose Carreras soars. They all do, actually, so I'm only nitpicking Cappucilli. If you're thinking of buying this recording, you should.<br /><br />And Abbado does wonderfully with this score. Boccanegra can be slow in parts, but you'd never know it from this orchestra. Dramatic and dynamic, and the orchestra and singers are in great synchronicity here. Well worth it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Pretty good game for fans of bejewelled but much better graphics and game play. Glad I got it when it was FAOTD.
0345803485|1.0|This is one of the worst written books Ive ever read. I ordered it because I bought into all the hype about it and I have to say the book is difficult to get through. The author's repeat use of the SAME words is so boring. She must have used the phrase \\"said dryly\\" about a thousand times in the book, and I don't even know how you say something dryly. Her continued reference to the characters \\"inner goddess\\" had me wondering after awhile if the character had multiple personalities. I found myself not really connecting or even liking the characters and struggling to get through the book itself. Many times I would think 'I dont even CARE about what's happening in this book.' I don't normally write negative reviews, especially about books, but this author is terrible and I do not see myself ever reading any of her works again. Save yourself money, it's not worth it, it's been totally blown out of proportion due to all the sex scenes, which in my opinion, are not that great either.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Flexible, well integrated, cloud-based product. Unnecessarily clunky, however, when sorting To-do lists. In this respect, &quot;Out of Milk&quot;, with its drag and drop sorting, auto insertion of check boxes, and the ability to toggle visibility of checked items, outshines Evernote. I find Evernote's cloud data storage and multi platform data accessibility more valuable than the above mentioned features, but would love to see Evernote incorporate those features in the near future.
B000TENE6Y|5.0|I misplaced, lost, or otherwise can't find my original so have purchased it again. Yes, it really is that good. But then again, it is Thom and the boys, so how could it be bad?
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The Hunger Games was quite entertaining.  The rental process was easy.  Being able to rent at home, at my leisure, was most important to me.  I'm always looking for new options for my \\"me time\\".
B004T4LUPW|5.0|It does everything I could hope for. I use this several times a day on my kindle for work. Since I'm constantly on the road traveling it allows me quick access to both my busy and free time to schedule additional work.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|this kind of movie is why i like dramas. it dives deep into the nature of close relationships, and wow does it hit home.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a charming story of escaping to India to a hotel for a fairy tale retirement.  However ... the perception of the owner is not quite what the visitors experience.  Watching strangers become friends and experience new levels of life in their latter years, is delightful.  An all star cast makes this even more delightful and refreshing.  I seldom buy movies, however, this is one that makes me smile and I will enjoy it time and again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I liv this game soooooo much have it on my xbox ipod and computer. it is awesome on all sytems don't miss out on this app get it!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a really good game this is the early version 0.4.0 give it some time it will be the minecraft we all know and hopefully love
B007M45PMU|5.0|This whole album is fantastic. I have to say classy girls stubborn love and Dead Sea are my favorites off of it.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|this app is awesome. it is free( I don't know why people are saying thar it is just a trial version, I have had it for about a month now and it still has not asked for money) it does everything I need it to, and it is easy to use.
0375507256|4.0|The above quote from this book refers to a musical composition that the character is writing.  That composition, a sextet, has the exact same structure as the book. The author is winking at us. Heck, he has a cleverness tic.<br />And we readers, an eager bunch, catch the wink like a kiss. We nod at all the allusions to Nietzsche and his Eternal Recurrence, to Spinoza and his God or Nature, to the back and forth to where we were, to the darn memories melting into time like tears in the rain. We note carefully which character has the birth mark and trace the evolution of that soul.<br /><br />So grouses cynical me. Appreciative me notes the nicely done changes of voice from one chapter to the next. I also love the occasional beautifully crafted moment which can be breath-taking.<br /><br />\\"As many truths as men. Occasionally, I glimpse a truer Truth, hiding in imperfect simulacrums of itself, but as I approach, it bestirs itself & move deeper into the thorny swamp of dissent\\" p.17.<br /><br />Very nice but nothing that many others could not have done as well. I can page through my commonplace books and find quotes from Churchill, Ross McDonald and Montaigne that are as true. I admit that is a fine company. Mr. Mitchell is an excellent and skilled writer and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. But whatever philosophy is expressed in his writing is as inchoate as his beloved clouds.<br /><br />Ours is a time begging for transcendence. That longing is what gives our movies, our novels, our thought whatever mythic quality they have. How many of us have picked up a book hoping that it can make sense of our lives?<br />Still I can understand why this book was made into a movie. The visual artistry will add to the sense of mythic poetry. However, computer imagery is not meaning. (At one point, the Cavendish character notes that an author he is reading has split her manuscript up into small chapters easily turned into the scenes of a screen play. O cynical wink! Were the movie rights already being discussed? O corporocracy!)<br /><br />But computer imagery, like this book, can be clever, beautiful and v. enjoyable. By all means, read it, enjoy it and track down its many i/allusions. But I warn you, you will still have to create your own transcendence. Sunt lacrimae rerum.
1423140591|5.0|I enjoy Rick Riordan's books and this one didn't disappoint! It's great to see he is continuing Percy Jackson's adventure's. I read this in 2 days so yeah it's that good!

0307155102|4.0|Lots of stuff packed into this book. This book is better for kids older than two, because of it's complicated nature.
B000RZGFZC|5.0|I gotta say this is their best one Ive heard and With metal classics like Dead Skin MASK,War Ensemble,Hallowed point,you cant go wrong if you are a Slayer fan.If you dont have it I would Highly recommend this one to anyone.

B009DJB9HC|5.0|Legendary producer Kevin \\"Caveman\\" Shirley put the rock guts back into Rush in the 1980s when they started to get too keyboard and synth oriented.  Guitarist Alex Lifeson was asked to ditch the reverb and Neal Peart  the electric drums. The problem being addressed was strikingly clear and indicative of the Eighties. \\"The songs had no \\"balls,\\" Shirley said. \\"They were thin so I was hell bent on making a heavy record.\\"  No such issue befalls  his Black Country Communion project. The Anglo/American hybrid is unfairly stacked with talent even by supergroup standards. With  Zeppelin, Sabbath and Deep Purple in its bloodline, their latest release \\"Afterglow\\" (out Oct. 30) is all balls; blunt force blues/rock trauma from both sides of the ocean. Fellow Brits Jason Bonham and Glenn Hughes combine forces with guitar legend in the making Joe Bonamassa and Dream Theater's Derek Sherinian for a hard rocking experience rarely  seen since its golden age in the early Seventies.<br /><br />Like its predecessors, the 11 track compilation starts out with a bang and then keeps exploding for another 53 minutes  as Bonham channels  his inner Zeppelin alongside Hughes' massive vocals and Bonamassa's  scorching Les Paul.<br />It's difficult to label BCC. Part English, part American,  blistering rock and hardcore blues. It doesn't really matter how they are categorized. If you're looking for a classic hard rock experience, there is no need to sort through your vinyl collection.<br /><br />For an exclusive interview with Joe Bonamassa and al the latest music news VISIT: [...]
0345803485|4.0|I had read about this in an Allure Magazine.  I then heard about it from a friend.  She told me about a group of women who actually have Shades of Grey toy parties!  I was intrigued and had to get the book.  It's good to see the mainstream finally being open to something other than \\"vanilla\\" sex!  It's been there all along, just a deep dark secret. If you like kink, or just want to explore something totally different, I highly recommend this book. Just be aware it's not for everyone.

B008DVJO8C|1.0|Ungawdly bad. Read ALL the one star reviews ... they are ALL correct.  I will bet some of those five star reviews are FAKE!! There has never been so many dishonest reviews like that which I have seen here on this BLOOD cd.  Amazon is pretty good too, as far as honest reviews go. Man, there is like no way in helll this is appreciated by ANYONE BREATHING.<br /><br />UPDATE: Hey, check out the 5 Star reviewers.  Almost all have ONLY REVIEWED THIS CD .... I KNEW THEY WERE FAKE!!!!!!!
B00913DPW2|3.0|HAUNT is decent Search, Logic, Puzzle Adventure game that has Great HD Graphics and nice Soundtrack.  App FUNCTIONS SMOOTHLY MOST OF THE TIME.  Lots of Hidden Puzzle pieces, INVENTORY Items and Hint Moths to look for everywhere.  Sadly, it is difficult to play compared to other games of this type.  It does offer Vague Hints but many people have to use the online Walkthrough to make any real progress.  CONS: I don't care for the seemingly Unnecessary Intrusive Permissions.  It should offer more clarity to get you started on solving many Uniquely DESIGNED Puzzles.  It repeatedly Crashes my Xoom Tablet after I play for awhile.  Overall, I Like it but am Disappointed with Flaws.  Deserves 5 Stars if fixed.  Only 3 Stars AS-IS!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|The acting, effects and actors were all great. But I'm sorry I sat through the whole thing waiting to get into it. But the life was all sucked out.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I was at first skeptical expecting only a few laughs from a movie that when looking at the artwork gave me the impression that I could expect it to be a spin off of the Munsters or the Adams Family, but there are so many great scenes & story \\"gotchas\\" that I would even consider watching it many more times just because of how well it is done, the effects are great & the laughs can give you cramps if you have any sense of humor.<br /><br />Kudos!
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing. Anyone who enjoys science fiction will enjoy this and hold it up as an example of the best that Television has to offer.

B009CYCF5I|1.0|This item is an exclusive for Target & is only $15.99 + taxes there. Do not give these fools your $. The album is awesome, but the $12 markup (minus taxes) is going to the reseller and not the artist.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I saw my husband playing this on his kindle so I downloaded it on both my phone and tablet.  It is so addicting, I can hardly put it down.  A winner!
B002WJI63A|4.0|Great toy I was able to find it since my son wants all the \\"Mario Bros\\" collection but its too small for the price,but my kid is happy that's what matters to me.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|This movie was a wonderful experience in the theater, and this DVD combo is a truly great home version of that experience. [Squirrel!]  The quality of the Blu-ray AND the standard DVD is exceptional.  Having seen the theatrical release (in 3D) prior to purchasing this set, I've now watched it twice at home with adult friends who aren't generally fans of animated features. [Squirrel!] It always impresses the new viewer, and after 3 viewings I'm still enchanted by the story and impressed with just how great it looks at home.  Highly recommended, and the preorder price on the set made it irresistable.  [Squirrel!]
B009B50QOU|5.0|Every single song in this album is amazing. Green Day's music definitely grow on you. I've listening to this album every day ever since I got it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I started the game on the beginner courses and thought I was in for a simple and way too easy game that I would end up uninstalling after a day or two. Boy was I wrong. After about the second course I started to realize there was an.actual challenge to be overcome on each course. On top of that there are so many courses each with 9 holes and assorted themes and obstacles. With unlockable powerups and achievements and replayable challenging gameplay I'm surprised I got this for free. Great game!
0783240287|1.0|JOSEPH etc was  a  great and memorable  show on stage (if  rather short). This  production is appalling and amateurish and the  staging is on the cheap side. Many cast members are seen looking directly at the camera when they should not be doing so.It looks terrible.Who directed this rubbish.The Jason Donavan  London stage show was  far superior.Get a copy of that is you can.It's brilliant.Wait for a better version.This one is woeful and forgettable.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I loved this four disc set because you can see each version of this film made.This is my favorite sci-fi movie along with a space odessey:2001.The visual atmosphere of this film is what I like best about it and the characters in this film have a lot of depth to them.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun game that reminds me of the old days of going to the fair with my parents and playing the carnival games...all the fun and no cost :)
B0000DK4RM|3.0|Once we got to play this movie..it was awesome. But little did we realize, it was from UK when purchased through Amazon. Much to our surprise! We had to literally buy a new DVD player to watch this. Different country codes for foreign movies and our old player was not compatible. Buyer beware!
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|this game is realy good looking but it will not let me put my name in as the player, it also crashes after each board, but saves progress. then crashes and losses progress after placeing collected items, the game works well on my wife's milestone x, but not my x-2  :-(

B002RT2BXQ|4.0|A very dramatically acted movie of a very good book. Ayn Rand was a civil libertarian, and her stories reflect her mindset.<br />I remember reading the book 40+ years ago, and my brain didn't have the people acting in such dramatic ways. However, the movie is very  good, and sends a good message particularly in this modern era when the government seems to be wanting to take over our free enterprise system while sucking the energy out of our workers. I particularly enjoyed seeing Gary Cooper.

B000J10ER4|1.0|Let me start off by saying that the Superman I knew and loved from my childhood was a paragon of virtue who fought for \\"Truth, Justice, and the American way,\\" and he didn't apologize for doing so. Apparently, the writers and directors of this movie believe that the old-fashioned values and patriotism that made me love this character had no place in the more \\"enlightened\\" age. \\"Truth, justice and the American\\" way is replaced with \\"Truth, Justice, and all that stuff.\\"<br /><br />In addition, Superman is not virtuous. He's not even a fairly moral person. He has a one night stand with Lois Lane and then leaves her for five years with his child. WHAT!?! No, just, no! At the same time that Superman is being made more \\"modern,\\" Spider-Man is being framed by the Old Glory. The contrast is staggering.<br /><br />In conclusion, this Superman movie not only destroyed my love for the character, but also any love I had for the DC franchise. It is one thing to make a character slightly immoral (Iron Man, for example), but it is another matter entirely to take a character and destroy everything about him that made him so iconic.<br />Goodbye, old friend, at least I can still look back at you with fond memories of how you used to be.
1451696191|3.0|This book didn't catch my attention until recently. I saw a preview for the movie and was intrigued because Emma Watson (Hermione) is in it and I've been wanting to watch the Harry potter people in different movies. But I have a small problem. I have this compulsion where if a movie is based on a book I HAVE to read the book first. That's just my thing.<br /><br /> I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It reminded me alot of the Catcher in the Rye (which is one of my favorites!) I was also intrigued by this book because I am a wallflower. Not to the extent that Charlie is, but I prefer to sit and observe then to act. I can relate to the anxiety that Charlie faced when he was challenged to come out of his bubble and really participate in life.<br /><br />This novel is made up of letters that Charlie writes to an unknown, random person who he simply refers to has a friend. This adds a very personal connection to the story as the reader is left feeling like the tale is just for them. The honestly in those letters is at times startling and shocking, but at the same time refreshing. I grew to love Charlie and my heart broke for him when things didn't go as he hoped, and then just a few pages later I was thrilled to see his victories in no matter how small or large.<br /><br />Another aspect to this book that I loved was the secondary characters. Many of them quickly took Charlie under their wings and  helped him in his person experiment to truly become a participant in life. Charlie becomes fiercely attached to them and they begin to mold him into a new person. However, Charlie never ceases being Charlie. I loved that. You can't just stop being a wallflower, it's in your nature. Charlie will always be a boy found sitting on the back row or standing in the corner, watching, but he grew into a young man who had the ability to step out of the shadows on his own terms. Watching the subtle changes in him made for an excellent read.

0385742886|2.0|I wanted so badly to love this book. This is the prequel to James Dashner's Maze Runner series, which I LOVED. I could not but down that series. I was counting down the days to The Kill Orders release, hoping that this book would answer some questions that the other three left to your imagination. I was wrong. This installment from James Dashner was very weak. It's almost like it went too far back (at least for my liking) It went back to before Thomas and his friends were even in the picture. I was really hoping it would focus more on the formation of WICKED and Thomas' and Teresa's involvement in the planning of the Maze and other trials. But it went even further back to the first sun flares. For me that was too far... it was almost like it was another story all together. It didnt really mesh with the other three books in the series.<br /><br />I also found the story very repetitive... people get sick, go crazy and attack others, repeat process for 327 pages. Just when I thought it would lead into the beginnings of The Maze Runner the book ends and never makes that connection.<br /><br />All and all I was very dissappointed... but still read the rest of the Maze Runner series by James Dashner. They are wonderful, but you can definately skip the Prequel.

0872860175|5.0|What can you say?  That Allen Ginsberg's Howl is one of the finest American poems of the second half of the twentieth century may be a matter of opinion (though it is my opinion), but that it was the most important is simply a matter of fact, and this modest black-and-white cover City Lights edition, with a selection of wonderful shorter poems besides Howl and a classic introduction by W. C. Williams, has for half a century now been riding around in the back jeans pockets of students, drifters, and hipsters.  The reviews here and in innumerable other sources will give you a good idea of what the poem is like, so I'll only add that anyone interested in modern American poetry, literature, or society should have a copy of this book.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I was really disappointed in this book on many levels.  The characters were unbelievable: the parents who wrote the 'Amy\\" series, the father in the senior facility, the flaky neighbor who considered Amy her best friend, even Amy and Nick.  None of them was developed into a real person.  If the rest of the book was at all plausable, perhaps psychotic Amy could have existed, but the fact that so much of the story development was unimaginable and the characters so unreal made this book a loser.  I was surprised and annoyed that it was a best seller and that I wasted my money on it.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This excellent recording of the entire Phantom of the Opera musical is like a front row seat to the play.  The acting and singing is solid, no poor performances, great cinematography.  I have seen the play in the US many times (including front row center) with 3 different troops, and there are only minor differences with the staging.  Personally, I prefer this version far more than the movie.  I am grateful that the recording is available on DVD and Blue Ray because, as a big time fan, I truly missed the play.  Nothing quite matches the magic of seeing the play from a front row seat.  But this is a good substitute.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty.  There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage.  Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.<br /><br />This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay.

B009UVWBMA|5.0|* The following review appears on the main \\"Red\\" page as well but is a review of this version which includes the extra tracks available here on what is the Target Exclusive version *<br /><br />There are going to be hundreds of reviews of this album out there (and yes, I'm old, I still call them albums) and I know I'm not in Taylor's main demographic audience. First off, I'm a guy. Second off I'm 42 years old and normally listen to things like Irish punk, The Beatles, Springsteen or some hard core country like Chris Knight. I love big band music whether it's Frank Sinatra or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. With all of that said, I adore Taylor and this new album \\"Red.\\"<br /><br />Taylor's songwriting is still in fine form here. The thing that always amazes me about her writing is that she's able to tell stories in her songs, she keeps it simple and more often than not finds one heck of a hook in the chorus. There is passion, there's energy and there is joy. Sure, there are so sad songs, but it seems to my that Taylor takes so much joy in making music that it's hard as a listener not to get caught up in that with her.<br /><br />After listening to the 16 tracks and the 6 bonus tracks available on some packages I have to say that Taylor's bonus tracks alone are better than what most artists are putting out as albums these days. The \\"demo\\" recordings of \\"Treacherous,\\" \\"Red\\" and \\"State of Grace\\" are excellent and polished works that are just a bit more stripped down than the versions that appear on the album. It's not really fair to call them demos, as when I hear that word I'm expecting below-par sound and performance. I think it's the mark of a good song if it can be done solo-acoustic (or at least very stripped down) and these three songs certainly hold up well.<br /><br />For me the whole album is very solid, there are no songs on this disc that I'd skip when listening to it. There is a nice mix of slower ballads and hard hitting rock numbers. Make no mistake about it, Taylor Swift is a rock and roll star. She's setting the bar for what pop music is and doing a fine job of it. It's funny, while listening to \\"Red\\" and the big anthmatic numbers I couldn't help but think this is the modern day version of Phil Spector's wall of sound. Sure, there are a lot of synthesizers here, but Taylor has an uncanny ability to create a big sound that just envelops you, especially if you like to play your music as loud as I do.<br /><br />I think it's the fact that Taylor is such a good songwriter and maybe more importantly storyteller that makes her so accessible across so many different lines. It doesn't matter how old you are or what gender you are, Taylor's songs resonate. Even a song like \\"22\\" which is an anthem for the young \\"let's go out and party\\" crowd it still hits home with me at 42, because believe it or not kids I was 22 at one point. And, I'm guessing the 10 year olds that hear the song will relate to it because they know it's exactly what they're going to want to do when they're 22.<br /><br />Red is a little bit country, a lot of pop and a heavy dose of rock and roll. Like some big artists before her, Taylor Swift is not a follower, but instead she is creating the standard for what is popular music. And maybe this is the old man in me coming out, but where most of popular music is fairly brainless and devoid of substance that's the opposite of what Taylor Swift brings to the table. She brings some great story songs, most of which (if not all) I'm pretty sure are very auto-biographical. Taylor is simply telling us her story, she's just making it rhyme and adding some killer hooks and melodies for good measure.Swift is a rock and roll star.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was great.  It kept me on my toes with suspense, but I didn't feel it it was as steamy as the other two. I would still recommend this book to anyone.
0439813786|5.0|This is a beautifully illustrated book which has fully lived up to it's other reviews.  My 9 year old who is a reluctant reader is avidly reading this book.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Movie was better than expected, likely due to the lackluster reviews by some who had high expectations of closure with respect to the Aliens series.  I liked it.  From what I see, it appears to be a prequel to the Aliens series and provides a split, or a parallel story.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel to this movie where the origin of the \\"Engineers\\" or the motive for transporting alien creatures to Earth is pursued.  As expected, awesome special effects.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I have to say that this was, quite possibly, the best sci fi movie in the past decade.  Great story, great cast, acting, effects etc.  One of a few movies i enjoy watching more than once.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|The game is entertaining not difficult to play. It's a little better then some match 3 games because you have to make sure you moved pieces to the end to collect in a certain amount of time.  It kept me busy during the hurricane until the kindle had to be charged. I'd recommend it especially being it's free.

B007NESBK2|5.0|Sade is so lovely, and this concert was so nice.  Obviously much-rehearsed, because it was flawless.  I loved the huge on-stage screen backdrop and how it was used - in one number she appeared in different windows and doorways, really cool.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the short film extra that's included - little time clips from before, during, and after the concert, but jumbled in time sequence.<br /><br />The sound quality and HD was immersive and felt like I was there.  If you have only even heard one song of Sade's and like it, you will enjoy the whole concert.
B00367XA1K|4.0|If you enjoy period movies and romantic stories, then \\"Reds\\" will entertain you.  It is quite long (almost 4 hours): two discs and a much needed intermission.  A 20-something free-spirited and progressively-thinking wife in Oregon (in a dull marriage to a dentist) falls in love with a handsome but somewhat naive writer with socialist leanings.  She moves to New York with him and joins the Village ultra-liberal scene.  Changing times and changing values in early twentieth century America influence the young couple.  Interspersed flashback comments by aged, wrinkled interviewees add a light touch, and there are other small elements of comedy throughout the movie, but I thought the attempts at comedy were only partly successful.  The story winds to Russia at the time of the 1917 revolution.  This long romantic tale likely will interest women more than men.  I thought the most interesting aspect of the film was one of its messages about how well-intentioned Americans of that period who had socialist leanings were taken-in by the early Communist movement, and how Communism quickly changed to incorpate repression and severe limitations in individual freedom that surprised and stunned the do-gooders who had earlier thought that Communism might have been a just cause.  Communism turned out to be an unworkable system full of inefficiency, repression, violence, and failure.  But these messages appear only during the last 20 minutes or so of this very long film, so I think the writer / director / producer was really trying to \\"sell\\" the romantic story in this movie rather than any profound message.  In short, this is a good movie for romantically-inclined persons who are trapped at home by a blizzard for a day and who still have electricity.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was extremely well written and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time. I simply could not get enough!
B007Q0CKAU|5.0|My class started reading this book together. I realized how much I loved it and so I could not possibly resist reading ahead.<br /><br />Tally started off as an average Ugly missing or New Pretty friends. Then she met Shay and was lead into a life of, following akward clues, falling in love, betrayal, which made this book an interesting, adventure full, life, story that I recomend for mostly young adults butother ages too. I will be readig the next four books, Pretties, Specials and Extras. I can not wait to find out what Tally Youngblood's life becomes.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The acting in this movie is tremendous.  I love Maggie Smith in anything - her timing and delivery are so biting, funny, and poignant.  So right off the bat, if you're interested in a lighter movie, as a break from the usual murder/violence/sci-fi action animated content, this is a good candidate for you.<br /><br />I would have liked to see the hotel manager's role developed a little more; he's talented and interesting, and I found myself hoping more time would be spent on his story line (and his girlfriend is a knock-out).<br /><br />But this film is not all fluff and sunshine, which definitely improves the story - when has life for anyone ever been all fluff and sunshine?<br /><br />I feel that some have over-analyzed the film; take it for what it is and enjoy it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I struggled with the beginning as the main characters shifted and met their demise.  I am so glad I kept going because I couldn't put the second half of the book down.  The characters are easy to relate to even though their situation is not.  I just bought and downloaded First Shift and Hurricane- I am definitely a new Hugh Howey fan and can't wait to read more.  I have recommended Wool to all my friends!
B008RZF1UO|3.0|First off, let me say that I think that Tommy Karevik is a talented singer, and is as suitable a replacement for Roy Khan as you're likely to find. He seems to get the style, and he proves in the first track by really going for it.<br /><br />I think this album falls down on the lyrics, composition, and production.<br /><br />The lyrics aren't as good as Poetry for the Poisoned, and nowhere near Black Halo. I wonder if this is where the real loss of Roy is showing through. The lyrics on this record are trying way too hard to seem dramatic. Tommy belts out mellow-dramatic none-sense at a rate that I more associate with bands like Stratovarius (Whose newest album, Elysium, is excellent btw). Lyrics like:<br /><br />\\"Send me a sign<br />Hear this broken melody<br />'Cause each night i die<br />In hell\\"<br /><br />sound pretty corny, and make me wonder if who-ever wrote them understand what they're writing.<br /><br />The composition really shines in songs like Sacrimony and My Confession, but it feels like there's alot of filler on this album. Too many of these songs sound the same, and I don't remember ever thinking that about a previous Kamelot album. I shouldn't be feeling the urge to skip songs on the first play-through. This, again, leads me to believe that Roy contributed to a lot of the song writing.<br /><br />Forgiving the song-writing itself, the production is where this album is truly hobbled. I purchased this from iTunes, and had to go into my file-system and check to make sure the bit-rate was over 128 (it was 256). This album is compressed as all get-out. On my best pair of headphones (ATH-M50s) it still sounds like its coming in over FM radio. If there's a deal-breaker in this album for Kamelot fans, I'd say that has to be it. If I hadn't already purchased it, I'd save my money and wait for a remaster some-day.<br /><br />In Summary, Tommy sings just fine, but I worry that Roy was the backbone of the song-writing. If you don't believe me, listen to thisalbum, and then listen to any of the last 6 albums, and I'm confident that you'll agree that they're all more interesting.

0385342063|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's books are just fun--madcap comedies of error where you just can't believe that the characters get themselves into these situations. This book starts off innocently enuogh with a missing engagement ring and then races into a case of mistaken phone identity that just grows and grows.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the story, I wished Poppy would have had more friends to call upon--real deep friends. That would have added a dimension to the story.<br /><br />All in all, I liked the book a lot.
B007V65R54|4.0|I am about half way through this book and plan to finish it.  It is interesting, but in my opinion, the author overly extends stories about forecasting by going into details not directly relevant to ideas about forecasting the stories are intended to illustrate.  I got the impression this is to lengthen the text to make the book longer.<br /><br />In fairness, many of the stories involve subjects with which I am unfamiliar and uninterested.  He doesn't take the time to explain a few terms, and I am uncertain of them from context.  A good example is the discussion of poker.  While he provides a chart of which hands win over others, other terms are used as if the reader knows them.<br /><br />On the other hand, the discussion of trying to predict earthquakes is easy to follow and interesting to me--and shockingly I just heard  in the news that defendants in Italy were found guilty of killing people because they didn't predict an earthquake.  Yet from the book, it is easy to understand that earthquakes absolutely can not be predicted. The discussion of moneyball and basketball is actually interesting, though sports are again not my interest area.  Predicting weather is also discussed, including some of the tricks of the trade in giving the forecasts to the public.<br /><br />I also thought the author should have explained why his web site (now a blog) is named fivethirtyeight, which I only discovered by Googling it.  It refers to the number of electoral votes.  He has predicted election outcomes with much success.<br /><br />At the begining, the book promised to get to more specifics about forecasting in the last half, so I am hoping it gets into more detail.  I would have given it 3.5 stars, so it seemed fair to round up.  As the book indicates, a score of four is accurate but not precise.

Since I was so disappointed when I first got the app with the lack of relaxing sounds, I never used it.<br /><br />However, I'm changing my review to Five Stars because this version has been updated with the full offering of sound choices as well as 6 binaurals.  Thank you for the update!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  This is a wonderful app for relaxing; one of the best I would say.  However, I am extremely disappointed with the number of choices for the Kindle version labeled as \\"Relax Melodies Premium.\\"<br /><br />The free version of \\"Relax Melodies\\" has more sound choices (41 as opposed to 36) and is just not available for the Kindle Fire.  So, to get this app for Kindle Fire, we have to pay $2.99 for fewer sound choices.  Why?<br /><br />I have the premium version for my iPod which was well worth the price.  There are 6 binaurals to choose from and 90 different sound choices.  Yet in this \\"premium\\" version we only have 3 binaurals and 36 sound choices.<br /><br />Very disappointing.  I do hope future updates will add more sound choices to bring this up to Premium quality.

SO GLAD I GOT IT!
B006Z7Z3R2|5.0|The only explanation for the bad reviews on here is that people expect it to be a gore fest that throws a lot of graphic, over-the-top CGI in your face. Today's Attention Deficit Disorder audiences want things fast and furious, and to not have to think. This movie is not for them. It is a good, old fashioned spook story that relies on good character development, takes its time to tell its story, and creates its chills by getting you to use your own imagination. It is more about what you don't see, then what you do see. The flaw is its ending, which does pander a tiny bit to what modern audiences expect from horror films, and only looks ridiculous in the attempt. However, this is only a minor flaw in what is overall a good thrill for people who like their chills to be realistic and intelligent.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike's book \\"Bigger Leaner Stronger\\", is a great book to not only motivate, but also to give direction to anyone. Whether you are beginning your training program for the first time or like me, getting back into it after many years of not training, this can work for you. In the past, I trained hard, felt good, received much praise about my routines and results and really want to move in that direction again. Mike has allowed me to visualize my program, diet and results. I am really excited to start my program and plan to send Mike before and after pictures. I feel his book clearly lays out the training required and clarifies the diet aspects for optimal results. I also bought \\"The Shredded Chef\\" to give me more knowledge and options for the nutrition side of a two to three month program. One last item to bring up is cardio.<br />I do drive a UPS truck about 9-12 hours daily and expect that may help on that end, but, I am still excited to read the third book I bought from Mike called \\"Cardio Sucks\\". Again, the combination of weight lifting, proper diet, and cardio, really are the keys to transforming your body into what makes you proud and pleased to look at in the mirror, more importantly, how you feel. Mike has replied to a couple emails with great info tailored to me. THANK YOU MIKE!!!
B007TK77QE|5.0|After HP I like a lot of readers wondered if JK could do it again well if you were in any doubt, she has.<br /><br />Read this book, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry.  I will not give a big review as I would not want to spoil the story for anyone, but will just say this is how writing a book should be done.

We were happy with the quality of the Blue Ray Season 4 and are now happily watching season 5.  Great series with perfect characters...good and bad!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The next best thing to seeing it at the theater. The end where all the Phantoms come out and Sarah Brightman( Andrew Lloyd Webbers ex wife and the person he created the show around(Christen)was the highlight.The reason Michael Crawford didn't sing is because he just came from a matinee of &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; which he was starring in and since there was also an evening show he needed to save his voice, but it was sure nice seeing him.

B004FA8NOQ|5.0|I have had my i7-2600K for over a year now and it has worked flawlessly. It is super fast and easy to overclock. With just a single change in the bios I am able to run it at 4.5 GHZ and it is rock solid. It is a big chunk on money to spend on a CPU but in my opinion well worth it.<br /><br /> It has enough power to future proof you for the next several years. I cant imagine any software or game needing more power then this for some time to come.

B000FCKRDI|5.0|I absolutely love Lisa Kleypas books.  The Devil in Winter is my favorite book of all the Wallflower books.  Sebastian St. Vincent seems to be a cold hearted rake who doesn't appear to stand a chance of redemption until our little Evie enters his life in full force.  Although the previous Wallflower books made her appear somewhat of a fraidy cat type of gal, she has some real courage to show up at St. Vincent's home and tell him she knows he needs to marry money and she is an heiress.<br /><br />From their flight to Gretna Green, back to her dying father's gambling hall, the story is intriguing and rapidly builds to an amazingly entertaining story.  It seems Sebastian isn't as cold hearted as we thought or perhaps he has finally met someone he can care about.  My favorite part of the book is when he fights Evie's evil uncles and cousin when they try to kidnap her.  Who would have thought it?<br /><br />I have already read this book three times and I'm sure I will read it again and again during the coming years.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Not a 5 star for WOW! what a great movie get out the popcorn but for the information that needs to spread to the public! Thank you for enlightening us. We need more non-biased information to make informed decisons based on the TRUTH. Watch It!!!
B005CM1INE|4.0|This review is primarily for the blu-ray transfer and not so much the film itself.  The transfer is acceptable, with a good level of detail, although this is offset by a high degree of film grain.  Also, the colors are a bit washed out, including the darker tones.  This detracts slightly from the suspense of the film--greater contrast generally suits the psychological thriller genre well.  The quality of the visuals do not matter all that much, however, since most of the movie occurs in one room; there is not much in the way of scenic vistas or action.  So if you already own this on DVD, it is not worth upgrading in my opinion.  But if you do not already own it and find it for a good price (as I did), then it is worth it.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself, I will simply say that Kathy Bates earned her Academy Award for this performance.  Her character Annie Wilkes is deservedly listed as seventeenth on the all-time movie villain list by the American Film Institute.  Very suspenseful.  Parental warning: the movie does feature psychological suspense, scenes of violence, and some profanity.  Viewer discretion is advised.  Otherwise, I recommend this movie for a few good scares.<br /><br />Additional Comment: This one-disc edition has no special features.
B000FA57US|3.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />I had never seen Halloween 5 (1989) until last week.  I really wasn't missing very much.  While the overall Halloween atmosphere is an improvement over the original Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981), the plot and especially the characters bring down this movie.  I found the characters incredibly annoying.  Injecting camp into a Halloween movie is just plain wrong.  A little bit here and there for comic relief is OK, but then the line needs to be drawn.  There was a new director for this movie and I think he was off the mark with the characters' behavior.<br /><br />My favorite Halloween movie in the entire original Halloween series of movies between 1978 and 2002 is Halloween III - Season Of The Witch (1982), starring Tom Atkins, Stacy Nelkin, and Dan O'Herlihy.  If you want to watch a far more serious and darker movie, then watch this one.  The atmosphere is eerie, the musical score is John Carpenter's best (collaborating with Alan Howarth), there is suspense, and the story and plot are very unique.  It deals with a warlock madman who has a sinister plot against children on Halloween night.  It also has elements of the Celtic origins of Halloween 3,000 years ago in what is now Ireland.  It doesn't have tired old Michael Myers, either.  My second favorite Halloween movie is Halloween (1978).<br /><br />The Halloween movies that came after Halloween III are sub par.  In other words, when Carpenter and Hill exited, the movies went south.  Halloween 5 is fair at best and I give it 2 1/2 stars out of 5, but I rounded up to 3.
B005MP28B2|3.0|Watch a Sean Penn movie? Really??? I would feel like a traitor, funding anti american idealism. He was so young when he became successful in acting he has no idea what it is like to be an average american adult. He needs to stick to dancing on his cloud for money and leave real life to the people who live it.

0062082353|2.0|First and foremost, I want to thank Chris Kyle for his service.<br /><br />However, this book is so poorly written that I stopped reading it.  Besides the fact that it jumps all over the place and has no flow, Chris Kyle comes across as a blood-thirsty sniper who enjoys killing people.  That is not the type of SEAL I am used to reading about, and hope it is not the type of SEAL he is.<br /><br />Reading about SEALS is very interesting, but this was just bad.  If you want an amazing SEAL book,<br />read \\"FEARLESS\\" about the late Adam Brown.

B007THA4FI|5.0|A perfect \\"political fairytale\\" for the raging arguments long heard, but not heard, on both sides of the aisle and The Pond.  I hope the heartless amongst us will read and take heed, but I sincerely and painfully doubt it.  The urge to shame and blame just runs far too deep with its attendant dire consequences blamed on rich economy's victims.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was totally amazed at the exciting story line that took place in this book. Author Day nailed it with this book. I couldn't put this book down.  She made these two characters, their personalities and their flaws pop! If you've read Bared to You this is a must read!  The suspense and mystery levels were Awesome!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is the brilliant documentary about the not so legendary `Rodriguez'. He recorded an album in 1970 called `Cold Fact' it was instantly adored by the critics and very fair comparisons were made about him to Bob Dylan.  It was then roundly ignored by record buyers. Undeterred he recorded a second album which followed the same trajectory as album one. Album three was not to be as the record company decided to drop him, just before Christmas.<br /><br />Meanwhile in a record store over in South Africa we have a story of a legend who has died in mysterious circumstance and a man who made it his mission to find out the truth about his unsung American hero. Rodriguez and his anti establishment attitude, easily accessible lyrics and effortless vocal style had made him an underground hit in apartheid struck South Africa. He was seen as a man who spoke for those who saw segregation as an unnecessary evil. His records had not only been banned but defaced by the authorities so that the offending material could never be played on air. Instead it took off underground, even with bootleg tapes etc. Then they heard he had shot himself, then he had burnt himself and the mystery of the man behind the shades deepened.<br /><br />This documentary tells of the amazing story to find a man that had inspired a nation but who never knew about it. It features a lot of his music and some live performances, and it is just inspirational. I am going to order his records after hearing some of them in the film. This is one of those films that you will want to tell your friends about, it has that rare quality of being a true story that you feel just has to be made up, but is all the more brilliant because it isn't. If you love music, good films or just a great heart enriching story then you will adore this great piece of history.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really cool. it has no problem at all. when your bored just start playing this game and it will get addicting

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very well written. A must for history buffs. Hard to put<br />down. Kept me up late. Am now reading the second book of this trilogy, \\"Winter of the World\\". Love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not often does a book comes along that is SO good you want to tell everyone you know to read it! The plot is unpredictable, and exciting enough that I had to skip a chapter fearing the outcome. Great adult (as opposed to YA) dystopian read!!!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I confess that I was among those who initially panned this movie. Like others, I felt that the film was all visual razzle-dazzle and weak plot, characters, and action. I too was annoyed by the \\"muddled\\" plot and apparent lack of character motivations. But, having seen it twice now on blu ray, the films strengths have become more apparent to me. Character motivations make better sense to me now. In particular, I now see how deeply and consistently insulted is the character of David. And so, I see why David does what he does.<br /><br />Largely on the strengths of the character (and characterization) of David, I now believe that Prometheus is a solidly fine film. Does it deserve five stars? To me, that ultimately depends on the quality of the sequel(s). If no sequels are made, Prometheus will only be an interesting film with unrealized potential (ditto if Prometheus spawns bad sequels). But, if the follow-up film(s) are as good as this first film in the series, then I believe Prometheus could wind up a classic.<br /><br />As a film series Prometheus has real potential. As the themes receive further development, I can see Prometheus plumbing depths of profundity rarely seen in films. I just hope that the initial bad reception won't nix the sequels or strip them of the budget they'll need to have.<br /><br />Give us a big budget visit to the Alien home world! Give us more Prometheus!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Now at only $71, this collection is a must-buy if you're a diehard SATC fan.  Remember when they used to be close to that much money per season?  Anyway, I am girl, but not usually into \\"girly\\" type shows.  My collection at home includes Breaking Bad, The Wire, The Sopranos, Oz, Deadwood, The Walking Dead, Mad Men, Carnivale, Eastbound and Down, Treme, Homeland, and um....Sex and the City?  I can't help it, I watch anything HBO - I've been doing it for years and only sometimes I am disappointed.  I was too young to watch this show when it first aired, but when I got a bit older and caught up, and have seen every episode many, many times.<br /><br />The great thing about SATC is that the writing is actually GOOD.  It's not only a chick show (which it is, yes), but a wonderfully written chick show.  If there was less of Carrie reading in \\"dear diary\\" mode (well, her articles), less women, and more POV from men, I feel very strongly that this show would have been hugely popular with both sexes.  The writers are just funny and know how to write good comedy.  If you watch the movies, just listen to the difference in dialogue quality between here and there.  It's not even close.  The movies are miserable in every way compared to the show.<br /><br />The great thing about this show is that it's just pure entertainment.  Many women are obsessed with the women characters of the show, but I just prefer to watch it purely for the laughs.  It is cleverly written and I like the characters, but its over-the-top lewdness and raunchy attitude mixed with genuine humor is what makes it special.  I watch SATC sometimes with my boyfriend in exchange for a back massage and he pretends he hates the show when we're not watching it, but he still laughs and used to say things like, \\"I guess if you want to put the next episode on, you can....\\" He's seen every episode about 4 times now though, so he's just getting sick of it, but yeah - anyone can enjoy this show, men and women.  It's just for fun, and now it's a classic.  Also, syndication ruins it.  They have to make sure to fit in commercials, so they automatically HAVE to shorten scenes, not to mention all of the nudity, cursing, and sex scenes are cut out...what's the fun of SEX and the City without that?!?!r fun, and now it's a classic.

B0098VXBIA|2.0|The movie starts slow and did not hold my attention. If you must see this movie go to Redbox. Its worth a 1.00 if that much... boring!
B003FSTN7A|1.0|Mixed review - the seller/Amazon did a wonderful job with sending me new, sealed product.<br /><br />When I opened it however, there were disks 1, 1, 3, 4, 5.  No disk 2, and 2 copies of disk 1.  Being a Canadian customer, hard, nearly impossible, for me to return.  Do not blame Amazon or the seller at all - product was in factory sealed packaging and there is no way they would have known, but if I had purchased locally, could have just returned it.<br /><br />Still look forward to buying from the Amazon team in the future.  Buy many many items at Amazon and they are great!
B0021L8V1G|5.0|This movie was in really good condition. As was the cover. I did not notice any skips or freezes during the film. I love the Iron Man movies.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am still reading this one...not quite finished...I skim or ignore the CONSTANT sexual parts and try to enjoy some of the drama going on.  I am really sick of the begging \\"don't leave me\\" and the constant \\"oh, no I'll never do that\\" junk.  Not sure if I will read the third one yet.  We shall see how this one ends with it's cliff hanger.  Sorry, I just find this a little boring, but it puts me to sleep at night.
B002RPR6DU|5.0|I saw this when I was kid. Nice story and excellent use of FX. I appreciated the fact it was another CGI movie.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I was very pleased with everything.  The blue-ray of course excellent quality, I don't have a 3D tv yet but when i get one this is the first movie I'm going to watch. I also saw the dvd and was great, and came with the digital copy and I copied it to my pc so i can watch it anytime.  Not a huge fan of the music but you are able to download the soundtrack.  The delivery was very quick in 2 days and at no cost, (AMAZONPRIME)so i was very pleased.  Overall this product is great and an excellent price as well.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect from a book written by J.K. Rowling aimed at adults and without magic, but this was not it. To me, this book was a rambling plotline about a small foreign town, all of its politics and character flaws. No one in this book was even vaguely good or slightly wholesome in anyway. It was like she tried to write the opposite of her Harry Potter series and ended up with this unattractive mix of British slang and bad attitudes. Nothing was resolved by the end of the story and I am not really sure where she was trying to take the readers. Overall, I was underwhelmed with the end result. I have been told that J.K. Rowling is going back to children's books permanently, and if that is the case not only is it for the better but she also realizes where her strengths and weaknesses are. This book is apparently wonderful to some people, as I have seen other reviews, but it is definitely not for me. Good luck with this read!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I know people have their issues with this movie, but I love it!  The only issue that I have with the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack it that this set does NOT come with the \\"making of\\" special features disc.  That, I believe, ONLY comes with the 4-Disc 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD set.  So buyer beware.  Then again, I'm one of those people who primarily PURCHASE movies so that I can see those special features.  If I just wanted to watch the movie again, I'd \\"rent\\" it.<br /><br />This version does have alternate beginning & ending outtakes and deleted scenes, which are cool, and a commentary track or two, so it's not a total bust.  Maybe somewhere down the line, they'll release all the special features as a separate disc for those of us who didn't get them with this version.  It would make a pretty cool companion DVD, as there are almost 4 hours of \\"making of\\" documentaries.  And they're really interesting to see, too (I borrowed that disc from a friend who bought the 4-Disc set).<br /><br />And now I begin the wait for the sequel...
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This one is the best ever. My two girls love this one with a passion. such an amazing story of love and sisterhood.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This was just what I was looking for because it is so easy to use to print my material.<br />Nice app!
B004FRX0MY|2.0|App itself is ok, but there is no ability to save MP3s on external storage.  I would be fine with the concept of saving internally and then copying to external, but if you do that, you lose the playlist you downloaded to your phone.  There is no 'playlist' file that can be transferred or updated to find the newly relocated music.  Now you just have a playlist on your phone that has '0' songs in it.<br /><br />Storage location is a must for this type of app.
B0081BU42O|5.0|I'd read Banks' Consider Phlebas, and, although well-written, didn't enjoy it too much.  I loved this book though.  I'll now try the other Culture novels.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I had my doubts about this movie based on the previews, but I picked it up because I liked the art-style.  VERY glad I did.  One of my favorite Sci-fi movies of all time.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|About half of the book seemed to be about something completely different from the second half. While the first half seemed to me quite authentic, the second was quite implausible. Grisham himself admits he did not do much research - with all his bestsellers he has now flunkies to do it for him.<br /><br />Also, obviously, he does not need too much more money. So, he can indulge himself in any favorite pastime, in this case in blasting most feds, more the judicial feds, bit less the FBI.<br /><br />What looked in the first part as a bit exceptional event becomes a pattern in the second half. I can be more specific but it will spoil the fun.<br /><br />Suffice to say that till about 50% of the book I was glad I spent the money, after reading the whole book 'not so much' as they say.<br /><br />Still, there some interesting characters in the book and stereotypes that are definitely not racist. Perhaps bit politically incorrect but even that is debatable.<br /><br />Judge for yourself.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game makes you want to keep playing until you've won all the levels! it's fun for adults and GREAT for kids to challenge their puzzle skills!!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Absolutely amazing work by Taylor. After seeing the Red Tour, I liked this even better, which I didn't think was possible.<br /><br />Best songs:<br />The Last Time, Treacherous, All Too Well, State of Grace, Holy Ground, Begin Again, The Lucky One
B009VB97EY|2.0|There wasn't enough Dancing.<br />There wasn't enough Joe Manganiello<br />There was too much Matthew Mcconaughey - dude is creepy.<br /><br />I didn't expect a blockbuster but man this was boring. It was just over all lacking something. Why have a movie about strippers/dancers when only 1or 2 can actually dance? This really could have been cast better probably. The only real casting complaint I have though is Kevin Nash. Come on, really? Ex wrestler? He didn't even put in effort during the few routines. Maybe that is supposed to be his character, I don't know.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just being picky but I wanted to enjoy the movie, not be bored to death.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I usually have trouble sleeping and play music so I can. It's really hard to find decent music that you can sleep to let alone an app that you can create your own music that helps you relax. So when I saw this free app I just had to add it to my Kindle Fire. This app is excellent because of the combinations of music's and volumes you can create to make your own inique relaxing tune. What's even better for me is that I can put my Kindle Fire on the &quot;sleep&quot; mode and the app will continue playing so I don't have to see the screen life and waste my batteries' life.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I built an awesome world on a lava seed. ok there was a castle, village, cabin, and... were is my huge mansion!<br />I found it cut in half and replaced with the original Terrain
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As a reader of intrigue and mystery, I was certainly not disappointed. Lots of detail about Yemen and the Islamic culture -- very important in getting the most out of this page-turner. John Corey and Kate Mayfield are in rare form. A definite thriller, but also a laugh a minute from detective Corey... I highly recommend -- this is DeMille at his very best!
B00000JR2A|5.0|This is an incredible album by any standpoint. The writing, production, choice of musicians and aural quality are impeccable. It took them a long time to make this album, and it was worth it; they got it right. This album is a pleasure to listen to with headphones or in any situation. It is a borderline concept album with some recurring themes, and the song order flows perfectly. Whether or not you are a long-time fan of TFF, if you enjoy and can discriminate great musicianship, songwriting, vocal virtuosity and sound quality, this piece of art should definitely be high atop your desert-island list.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I stumbled on this one and wasn't sure what to think, but ended up really enjoying it.  The five stories fit perfectly together, you'd never know they were released in a series, it functions as a novel.  The characters are engaging and the whole thing has kind of a Lost feeling to it.  I love books where the protagonists slowly figure out what's going on behind-the-scenes and that's what we get here in spades.  The strong female lead is well developed and I can honestly say I enjoyed just about every virtual page.
0385344333|5.0|I was shocked to go to this site and see how many people were disappointed with this book.  I downloaded it, started reading it a few hours later, and wanted to miss work and other activities so I could continue to read.  I actually am back on Amazon to buy a hard copy as I want to loan it to several people.  I highly recommend it.
B003XREL98|4.0|British raj and the their social life in India told beautifully, good story, good story telling. Classic literature. Like it
0316228532|2.0|Yesterday I read about 10 pages of the book. All the words that sprang to mind were: so-so, mediocre, boring, dull, lifeless...<br /><br />After reading 10 pages, I am not sure whether I can finish this book. A good book reads you, but you need to push yourself to read a dull, boring book.<br /><br />I would like to say sorry to JK Rowling for this negative review. But this is a genuine from-the-heart review.<br /><br />My advice to her: focus on her core competency - writing books about the magical world of wizards.
B007L6VR6M|2.0|I just can't fathom how any producer could persuade such a stellar cast to act in such a mediocre movie.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Well worth the wait!<br /><br />Only speaking from personal experience, I found this motion picture to be more than worth the wait to receive it.<br /><br />Having been a Ridley Scott fan for years, and having the good fortune to start viewing the Alien kingdom of films in the theater when it was released in the 70\\"s, I can further offer my opinion that Prometheous caps the Alien series with a \\"Gold Cup\\".<br /><br />This is quite easily the best sci-fi film to come along in a long time. The production values are above par; the acting is sublime; the writing well-written and well-conceived. The photography simply dazzling; the CGI is used to great affect, without it detracting from everything else which makes this film.<br /><br />If you are an Alien fan, missing this film is anathema to you. After watching Prometheous, the grand arc of the Alien storyline comes into focus and is clear.<br /><br />What the author postualtes grabs you at a deep, visceral level, and you don't see it coming, the surprising way the film eventually resolves.<br /><br />I envy all of you who are watching this for the first time. Just one thing you must count on:  therre's is no way ANYONE will be able to see this movie just once. I've already watched it five times, and I'm still getting things I missed.<br /><br />Have fun!

B004PGNB1K|4.0|Well written with characters that had plenty of attributes which were both mysterious and appealing. The main plot running through the book could have been more explored.
B002GHHHG0|5.0|Legendary horror icons George A. Romero and Stephen King team up to create an anthology classic in 1982's tribute to the horror comics of the 50's, \\"Creepshow\\".  Bookended by a dark story of a boy punished by an abusive father for reading a Creepshow comic book, this fan-favorite film goes on to tell five stories of terror to chill your bones! In \\"Father's Day\\", an awful old man takes revenge for his murder from beyond the grave. In \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\\", a country simpleton falls prey to an ever growing fungus from outer space. \\"Something to Tide You Over\\" is a revenge upon revenge tale of adultery and its consequences for everyone involved. \\"The Crate\\" basically takes the Looney Tunes' Tasmanian Devil cartoons as fodder for what is probably the best segment in the film, a story of a man embarrassed and brow-beaten by an awful woman, and what he does about it when he discovers a seemingly perfect solution. And, finally, \\"They're Creeping Up On You,\\" a tale of a Scrooge-like man with a germ phobia whose supposedly bug proof apartment becomes overrun with the critters!<br /><br />\\"Creepshow\\" is a really fun horror anthology (my favorite type of horror film) from beginning to end, though not all the tales are equal. The wraparound is fascinatingly creepy. Father's Day is, in my opinion, the weakest of the bunch. I just don't find it that interesting. Jordy Verrill is close in the running for best story. It's downright disturbing, silly as it is (and King plays the lead!). Something to Tide You Over is a great one in the Amicus anthology tradition, and with a great cast, too! The Crate is most likely the favorite for most folks, though I'm just guessing, because the idea is just fantastic and it is well played out. They're Creeping Up On You is very good, but it's also very gross; one you may be tempted to fast forward through on repeat viewings. Well, I particularly dislike cockroaches...<br /><br />This film is loaded with familiar faces, creepy thrills, and even lots of humor, and it's well worth having in your collection. The DVD is a bit lackluster, but at least it is widescreen (as well as full) and comes with the theatrical trailer. Say what you want, but a lot of great films don't even get that much! Of course, for the Blu-Ray release, there ought to be more, or at least an improved transfer. But, I HEAR it appears exactly the same as the DVD! So, basically, you should go with whichever you find more affordable. They are, as I've heard, basically the same thing. Myself, I've had the DVD for a long time. It was probably one of my first DVDs, in fact, probably because I DID find it one of the more affordable DVDs at the time I was getting into the format. At any rate, love the film and thoroughly enjoy rewatching it, especially at this time of year. I highly recommend it.ls, and even lots of humor, and it's well worth having in your collection.

0143142364|5.0|I listened to this a few years ago and loved it just as much now as I did then. Unfortunately I only own the abridged audio version, but it's still very good. The abridged version of the prequel, Pillars of the Earth, was not nearly as good. World Without End abridged was still 12 CDs long!<br /><br />This book is simply well written and an excellent listen. There is a single actor who does all of the voices and he does them well. His pace is good, he has distinct voices for all of the characters, and he is interesting and engaging throughout the book.<br /><br />This is a great book with a wonderful story and unforgettable characters (well, except that there are a lot of characters to keep track of, so sometimes I forgot who some were, but then quickly remembered again!). If you liked Pillars of the Earth, you will like this. If you like 14th century stuff, you'll probably like this. If you like historical fiction, you may like this too.

B009FZZFME|5.0|this is my all time favorite series! Its not really about the zombies and being spooked by them, its about watching the characters learn new techniques on how to service this sort of attack. Very much worth every second of the hour of my life to sit and watch!

But Auggie has a wonderful family, a mother, father, and sister and dog, Daisy, who proclaim their love daily.  The author hits home through different characters that Auggie's face will always elicit responses from screams,shudders, horror and panic.  But this book is uplifting and with each chapter and character, Auggie finds an inner strength, friends and champions to combat those who disparage him, bully him or just plain ignore him.

B0098VYCCE|3.0|The acting was a bit staid. Ending was a flop where everyone stood like stones. The scene took so long and you wondered where this was going. Does she marry the Duke and live happily ever after?

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The game is, really, fun at first, but playing continuosly or leveling up makes it harder and a little more boring because you just do tap tap tap tap aww a coin fell off the edge, over &amp; over and over again. so if you get this app you may also call it boring. how people LIKE it be cause its a fair game is just plain silly. Younger audiences may  not under stand the game so I recommend for ages 8+. Younger kids may play but the game could easily please, confuse, or bore them but it depends on what they are like. So have fun with this item. Hope fully you enjoy. For more infor mation since I am not a llowed to give out my e mail, con tact Amazon, or what ever company your electronic uses or GameCircus LLC. Thanks have fun enjoy! :)

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I feel like every book has something to offer. While this was, simply put, a love story, the book certainly offered me a new perspective on sex. The characters where easy to care about, and excitement was a certainty with every page.<br /><br />I liked reading the book. Fifty is a fantasy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't get enough of these stories! E L James did a terrific job and I hope to see a fourth book soon.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|I have been a fan forever. There were a few good tracks on Sonic Boom but I just can't get into this record. Paul and Genes age is really showing in their voices. Tommy is a solid player but his song just rips off an old Mountain tune. In the end it's an insult to try and put this in the same category as Revenge or Destroyer. I know Paul stated that He couldn't let Psycho Circus be their last album because he felt it was sub par. This is better??? Give me a break.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|After listening to the first two outings by The Fireman this one comes along. I liked this in ways the other two differed. This one was more commercial. Add the special edition (if you can get it with remixes). It could have been released years ago in the 80's. I think \\"Sing The Changes\\" could have been a single. There are other standout tracks as well. Well, got to get a** back to work so check it out (sorry to cut this review short ;-( but have to go). It is very much a good listen for McCartney fans.<br />Drop by my website sometime @ JudeMac Forever.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I have been disappointed  given the hype and excitement surrounding this series. I barely got through the first book. I found the writing to be poor and the story not interesting. Yes, it was titilating. this second book was better in that the writing has improved a little the editing I think was better but she repeats herself<br /> over and over. I got it, she loves him! We are introduced to some new characters and you do begin understand Christian's darkness. I became bored with sexual sitinuations. Too much of a good thing? the story content comes off a bit corny, un believable and downright silly but it is a fantasy so I guess anything goes. the best thing I can say is that this author has a great marketing team!
B008NW67E0|4.0|I loved the sound of the first Mumford and Sons CD and was very excited for this one. While I enjoy listening to the instrumental part, some of the lyrics were a little religiously heavy-handed for my taste. Still a good CD overall!
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I have been a fan of Jonathan and Charlotte since I saw their audition on Britain's Got Talent. I was simply dumbfounded by how well these two sing. I am still staggered by these two. Having listened to the CD \\"Together\\" all I can say is if you want to hear how angels sing, listen to these two. These two continue to inspire me. I just think this is one of the greatest stories of friendship and talent to be seen for many years.  Some of my favorites.. \\"The Prayer\\" is exactly that..a prayer..so thoughtful.\\"Caruso\\" is at a whole other level with these two. Andrea Bocelli has competition!! \\"Il Mondo e Nostro\\" simply enlivens the soul...chills down my spine every..single..time. \\"Forse\\" is a most unique twist on Muse.. I am pretty sure I may be one of these two's biggest fans!! Well done you two!!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Wasn't crazy about the first Book as it seemed to be a remake of 50 Shades of Grey story but this was better with a much better twist.  If you read the first book of this trilogy, I recommend reading this.  The only flaw is that you now have to wait for the last version of the story.  I'd recommend waiting until the 3rd book is out so you can read them back to back.  It's difficult getting back into the story after so many months of waiting.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Its soooo much different than anything else I've read before.  It was a little slow to begin with but then it sucks you in and you can't stop reading it!  Mind=blown
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I have been a massive Killers fan since dot and could not wait to hear this LP.Part of me was worried it wouldn't be as good as i hoped and another part of me kept saying \\"what r u worried about...it's the Killers.They have never let you down before so relax\\" and finally upon my first listen i was not disappointed one bit.Great LP with the most amount of consistent emotion and melody to boot.I was holidaying in Melbourne when this came out so i was lucky enough to purchase the Australian LTD edition with 17 tracks and it made a massive difference.My favourite songs are Be still (Alternate version),The way it was,Miss atomic bomb,Here with me,Heart of a girl,Be still,Carry me home,Runaways,The rising tide,Battle born and Runaways (Michel remix) in that order.These songs hit a nerve and take u places whether it be general troubles we all go through in life or relationship problems.Brandon's voice fills up the LP with so much emotion you can taste it.My favourite Killers LP's (with the 1st being the best) are:Battle born,Day & age,Flamingo (although not a Killers LP per say),Sam's town and Hot fuss.Sawdust i could take or leave and my favourite x'mas songs by them are Boots,Happy b'day Guadalupe and A great big sled.Overall a great consistent band who keep getting better each outing.Can't wait to see what they do next.I just hope They never lose the heart and emotion along with their great melodies.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|I bought this as a CD when it first came out.  I have it loaded on my ipod and my computer and it is in the cd player of my car!  I really love this entire album.  There isn't one song on it that I want to skip.  I downloaded it for my new Kindle.  I listen to it when I read.  Barbara's voice paired with so many incredible voices is just magic.  I have many of her albums, but this is one of my favorites.

B001QJUX24|5.0|Ethan Edwards proves to be one of the most complex and controversial figures of American cinema thanks to the clever direction of John Ford and the equally incredible performance of the legendary John Wayne. Definitely a must-watch for any fans of the genre or the cinema as a whole.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I put off on seeing this movie after hearing so much negativity about it, and seeing the review scores for it I decided to put it off. I realize the mistake was reading too much into negative reviews probably by the same people that would give  film like this 1 or 2 stars and a film like Paranormal Activity (that's barely a film btw)5 stars. Cloverfield although a shaky cam movie is the only one I can see having a legit reason to be shaky. The characters are running for their lives most of the time, they are always panicking, they use the camera as a tool like for light, and eventually start using it to document what they see. In this movie it actually makes sense to have a shaky camera and the shots although never clear make sense. This is the first person perspective of someone caught in a monster attack and that's what the movie is about.<br /><br /> They show just enough of the creature to let you know that you do not want to be near it. The few shots they are seen of the creature explain more than enough about it. It's not like Godzilla 2000 where the creature is some mystery most of the time. It's revealed in a more interesting way. When everyone is running from the creature they barely see it only the damage it does but, once they start going towards the creature they see more of what it is. The plot is pretty foolish though in that it's about a group of friends running back into danger to find 1 girl that may or may not be alive even. The group does foolish things but I didn't find it to be annoying or that silly as people seem to complain about. Why? because all they really do is bring you to the action. Running away from the monster, fighting it, going into buildings, etc. etc. that's really about it. It's not like they're screaming and yelling at each other for 20minutes. They do scream and yell and argue BUT, the difference is it's when they're actually doing something interesting so your not paying so much attention to them as to what it is they are doing.<br /><br /> This mostly is your typical monster movie but done with a much better and much more film worthy budget that makes it believable. That's pretty much what makes the movie good is that it's believable. Nothing that's too impossible ever really happens, and the worst thing I can think about is when they moved the girl who was impaled (that's usually the worse thing to do but hey, it's a movie and they were in danger). I liked Cloverfield and wish I watched it much sooner. The promoters did good for this show keeping the \\"monster\\" a secret and just showing clips of the chaos. It kept people guessing about the film and that's an interesting way to market a giant monster movie.<br /><br />4/5 for this one. Good movie, fun to watch, and enjoyable.ng.<br /><br /> This mostly is your typical monster movie but done with a much better and much more film worthy budget that makes it believable.

B007VYQ9G2|5.0|This blu-ray looks great! I've been hoping for more docs in hi-def, and this one delivers the reality. The doc isn't especially fabulous, but there are a few truly fine things, especially when Oscar finds his mentor (don't want to spoil it saying more). That's a rare happenstance and getting it on camera in this quality is a once in a lifetime deal.<br /><br />My gal loves monkeys (hence being with me), so I got this for her with high hopes, and we both loved it. Anybody would have a hard time denying some ancestral background with simians while watching this, but boy I wish I could hang around on that level. Their societal setup sure ain't very different from ours, either, is it.<br /><br />The best moment for me is Oscar's eyes when his new Dad gives him some food and you see the very deep gratitude and love. Everybody involved in the corporate destruction of our rainforests so we can eat more fast food burgers should be shown that Clockwork Orange-style for a week to wake them up.<br /><br />The final stat, that there were a million chimps in the wild in 1960 and now only 20% of them are left, says it all, sadly. Who are the real apes here? At least these ones know how to live in harmony with their environment. Makes you wonder what intelligence really is.<br /><br />For positing those questions to our young ones--and we the not so wise elders--in such tremendous visual depth, this is well worth seeing. Add a few bits of slo-mo genius, such as rain hitting the puffy fungi, and the incredibly close footage which took five years of co-habitation to achieve (as explained in one of the many very useful extras), and Chimpanzee becomes a vital reminder of what our seemingly cozy little suburban lives are costing the rest of this planet.<br /><br />Isn't it high time that we stopped monkeying around?

Freddy has a bunch aswell. those of you looking to have the whole mystery of aliens laid out and explained in one movie are not using your heads. this franchise requires several more movies to do it justice.. we are about half way there... that said, hopefully the movies keep coming every few years.. waiting 30 years for the next one would suck immensely.

B006Z00M9I|4.0|This movie is awesome, mainly because of the children!  These are the best little child actresses!  I do think the original movie should have included Kristi jumping off the balcony and being caught by the demon, because it is so darn creepy.  The scenes with the oscillating fan camera are super scary to watch!  The sheet ghost collapsing freaked me out!  This extended version had me avoiding my closet for days!  Rent it!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I read the reviews before purchasing which were not so hot. As I have enjoyed all the Reacher novels, I bought it and was not disappointed. My only regret is that it takes so much longer for Lee Child to write another, I finish them far too soon. Looking forward to the series continuing.
B000002NZO|4.0|Most people when they think of Genesis, they think of the megahits like Invisble Touch or Land Of Confusion. What they really don't know is that Genesis started way back in 1969 as one of the most innovative and artistic progressive rock bands of all time. Way before Peter Gabriel was singing about sledgehammers, he was a long haired hippie madman that wore bizarre costumes and played with some of the most technical musicians on the planet.<br /><br />This, their 1970 sophomore release, paves the way for later brilliance. The band is in much of a pastoral mood throughout the release, and there was still a lot of work to be done. But this is still a good album. Looking For Someone begins the classic sound: Peter's resonant soulful voice, Tony Banks' powerful keyboard playing, and a dark sinister feel. Other standouts include the melodic Visions Of Angels and the climax of Stagnation.<br /><br />Of course, the real winner here is The Knife, by far Genesis' heaviest and most powerful tune. The song would be a stage favorite for years to come.<br /><br />My only downside is that the long winded White Mountain doesn't really go anywhere, and Tusk, while a good song, is just a little too short. Other than that, this is a great introduction into the surreal world of Genesis.

I also enjoy the moods they set and the consistent transition between songs. That's something YouTube jut can't give you, and its appreciated!<br /><br />If you like 80s metal this well worth your money, buy it!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The book had my interest immediately! It held my interest the entire time, but from the time Sophia met Charles the story really flew right by. The romance added some hot scenes to the story but didn't get in the way. There is a lot of action and mystery in this story that kept me guessing and shocked and surprised me numerous times! Charles and Sophia were excellent characters and even the side characters in the story were so well written they felt like people I knew. So very glad that I did read this one!

The audience is not expected to cheer for victorious and righteous royalty at the conclusion of Pinocchio (1940 Disney).<br /><br />It's a story about a lonely bachelor artist and craftsman, Gepetto, who makes toys and entertaining clocks which \\"perform\\" mechanically.<br /><br />Gepetto creates a marionette type puppet in the shape of a little boy, and wishes in his prayers the boy would come alive and become real, thus making Gepetto a father. After he prays and goes to sleep, his home is visited by \\"The Blue Fairy\\" who grants half of Geppetto's wish as a reward for the old man's goodness and kindness. The puppet comes alive, but is still made of wood, and will only achieve status as a \\"real boy\\" (i.e. a human boy with real flesh and bones) if the puppet earns that by doing good things, and listening to his conscience. A visiting cricket named \\"Jiminey\\" is recruited for the job, and after Gepetto awakens and learns to his joy that Pinocchio has come alive, the puppet goes out into the world where he must make good by doing good, and in the end, after several set backs, does that. He rescues his puppet maker father from a giant whale named \\"Monstro.\\"<br /><br />The movie ends happily with no departure from the happy old man's small home which celebrates the end of his loneliness, and the arrival of human company in his life. Jiminey Cricket ends the movie (the incredible, lilting, haunting voice of \\"Ukelele Ike\\" Cliff Edwards, the voice of \\"Jiminey Cricket\\") with the simple song \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" and a final portrait of the lovely star lit night time sky casting it's friendly light over the small Swiss Italian village.

0385535147|2.0|As a hardcore J Grisham fan I was sorely disappointed. The story is more of a mish mash of ideas from his previous books and lacked the hard pace and excitement I saw in his earlier works. Its almost as if he wrote the book just so we don't forget about him. The zinger's were old and did not hit the spot. I expected something in the realm of \\"The Broker\\" but got something totally different. The characters were not as colorful as those in his previous books, the bad guys were run of the mill with no personal conflicts as such and the plot in my opinion was half baked and a little too generic. Not even close to his best work.<br />Normally I find a line in JG's books that will just simply cause me to double over in laughter. In this book I can honestly say I found none. It was like watching a bad movie where you keep watching just to see the ending because you have already watched half.<br />In the authors note he says \\" Inevitably even the laziest of writers need some foundation for their creations, and I was occasionally at a loss......\\". This indeed was a VERY LAZY BOOK.
B006AN78XS|3.0|\\"Midnight In Paris\\" (2011) directed by Woody Allen at age 76!<br /><br />The following are comments about \\"Midnight In Paris\\" (2011) and also (at the end of the comments) a brief memory of a time I met Woody Allen personally.... from Tex Allen, SAG Actor.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />The \\"Midnight In Paris\\" (2011) movie is OK and interesting many ways....movie making is very hard work, and Woody obviously went easy on himself and the actors part of th movie....took a lot of short-cuts....how to make movies at age 76 and not die from overwork, it appears!<br /><br />The main character gets into a time warp and goes back to both the 1920's and the 1890's and talks with celebrities in Paris during those two periods...quite a WHO'S WHO laundry list of famous people...maybe 2 dozen of them.<br /><br />Nice photography of present day Paris, too, which is very clean, clean, clean and so scrubbed is lacks charm in contrast to older movie depictions of Paris when it's charming (AMERICAN IN Paris [1951], etc.).<br /><br />The actors improvise a lot, and Woody's script has about 3 very good short sections with memorable writing, etc.<br /><br />The movie is no classic, but not bad, either. Young Owen Wilson has the lead role, plays the part of a writer with girlfriend problems and job problems...all comic ones...same as Woody when he used to star in his own movies.<br /><br />Documentary part of the DVD I got shows Woody at a press conference in 2011 at Cannes, and his looks very fragile and unhealthy...his skin is very yellow and pasty looking, and one eye looks bad, like a man who had a stroke...and his speech isn't clear at times......but...he keeps on going like old man river.<br /><br />He really is one of the great figures in cinema....like D. W. Griffith, I think. I met him face to face in NYC in 1972 at a place where he played his clarinet several times weekly with the house jazz band...called \\"Michael's Pub\\" as I remember. I was living in Manhattan then, selling educational movies....had a jazzy apt. in the easy 60's near the place where Woody played...went to see him one afternoon with a girlfriend who knew about it. He talked about the Mets baseball team.<br /><br />Woody is very important...made 41 films since TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN in 1968...... Woody made that movie in SF CALIF on almost no money!<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor.selling educational movies....had a jazzy apt. in the easy 60's near the place where Woody played...went to see him one afternoon with a girlfriend who knew about it.

B003MAOTP2|5.0|Not much to say but speechless!!, I can think out a 24 page research of how good this movie is...<br />one of the best films that you'll see in this generation; shows two side of religion and how they consider Jerusalem important to both Islam and Christianity. Jerusalem is a place meant to be shared by all and not claiming that its 'owned' by this nation or coalition of nations, but a place of where people (anybody) could worship God without any restraint.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was intrigued in buying this book because I am an avid Harry Potter fan and I enjoy the storytelling abilities of JK Rowling.  When I started this book it wasn't what I expected, it was completely the opposite and I wasn't a fan originally of the book. I felt that it was lacking a conherent plot and no action or a story line.  However, as I read on I felt like it was more a social commentary on modern day English life, and the politics and problems that plague England and could be applied to other parts of the world.  While I was in love with the book like Harry Potter, I felt that JK Rowling is an excellent story teller and the ending was super exciting and amazing!!!! While I would agree with other reviewers that it was a great book but I throughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to people to read!!
B000VSYDRM|5.0|The visuals run from stunningly gorgeous to commonplace to extraordinarily grotesque.  Very artfully made movie, with surprises such as Dustin Hoffman in a major role, and a detailed peek into the ancient art of perfumery, and even recalls for us the role of the Church in France during this time.  The story also delivers an interesting theory on the rank of scent among other attractants such as politics, religion, beliefs, and money.  Would watch again.
0316212377|4.0|I have enjoyed all the Culture books. I enjoyed this one too. I had hoped that what exactly Subliming is would have been better explained. Still, perhaps the ineffable is not describable. A point that bothered me was that I didn't see how a culture as small minded as the Gzilt appeared to be, would be in a position to actually Sublime. Observing the politics, assassinations, and generalized poor behavior of the Gzilt citizenry, I saw no evidence of an emotionally or intellectually advanced or evolved race of beings. Perhaps a civilization sublimes because it gets bored with itself. That would be sad. I do have one question though: Banks uses the word \\"irresilable.\\" What exactly does this word mean?

B008BM9L72|5.0|It is fantastic that Amazon.com made the entire Fifty Shades Trilogy available for the Kindle.  The books are a pretty good read.  At the end of the first book, the reader is left hanging a bit as to what else happens in the rest of the story.  Having the trilogy all at once meant that with the click of a button I was able to start the second book.  The books themselves are an easy read, not extremely well written but its a good way to pass some time.  As the books go on, the characters are developed more.  All in all it's a good read!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The few things that happened in the movie that most people criticized were not enough for me to drop stars off of this rating. The story was great and the special effects were phenomenal. I particularly appreciated the very last part which lends clues to the beginning of a well known series of excellent sci-fi movies.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Since I discovered The Piano Guys on youtube, I've been a huge fan. I simply love how they take any song from classical to modern hip hop and make it their own. Their CD does NOT disappoint! It even includes some of my favorite youtube videos like Cello Wars and Peponi. Truly a work of magical musical genius!

B0083P1QUM|4.0|I've read all of the Scarpetta novels by Cornwell and have thoroughly enjoyed them.  I was a little disappointed with this novel because more time was not spent with Benton, Lucy and Marino.  Also, I wanted the motives and hows of the killer more fleshed out.

B0083SBMBM|4.0|I live in the UK and brought this region one version as the UK releases on dvd and blu ray do not have the commentary by Joss Whedon and the film itself has been slightly edited.<br /><br />The film was excellent (as expected as I saw it at the theatre) and the commentary was informative and amusing like all Joss Whedon commentaries.  If you enjoyed the Marvel films that lead up to The Avengers it is simply not possible for you to not enjoy this.  If you are new to the franchise The Avenger's is written in such a way that you don't need to have seen the other films to understand who everyone is and what's going on.<br /><br />The dvd itself played perfectly on my multi region dvd player.<br /><br />I would have rated this as 5 out of 5 if it included the other special features that are available on the blu ray.  I would have brought the US blu ray but unlike my dvd player my blu ray isn't multi region.  The UK blu ray release is dissappointing as it has a hardly any special features at all for reasons unknown.  I suspect sometime in the near future a 'special edition' blu ray will be released in the UK to include all the special features but until that day I am more than satisfied with my region 1 import (and the service by Amazon in shipping it etc) as even with the shipping costs it was still only cost me as much as buying it in the UK and I least I get to listen to the commentary!
B009GEAPYW|4.0|When I saw the previews for this movie I was EXTREMELY skeptical! I was thinking \\"No way am I watching this movie!\\" But I shouldn't have been I didn't realize it until my husband pointed out that this was a DC novel at some point and time (which lets me know that it's going to be made of good quality) It's nice to know that although Batman is old in this one.

B0098460O4|5.0|I can ditto everything everyone has said, except Fred. He needs a better stereo system.<br /> I got my cd today also. It is more beautiful than I thought it would be. I also have watched the interviews and followed J&C since I learned of them a month ago.  It is because of their excitment over the album that I bought it.<br /> In one interview Charlotte told how- The Prayer- has evolved since they first sang it in school. She loved the way it turned out on the album. That was a plus for it for me. Then I heard them tell about- Rule the World- which is their favorite song together. It's my favorite too. I looked up the original and heard it. It was bland compared to J&C's version. It's like a cake without icing and then you put the icing on it and it's THE cake.<br /> It will be a pleasure to watch & listen to J&C grow.D.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a must-have addition for any 3D tv owner. It looks just as great as it did in theatres and has some pretty cool extras on board as well. Too bad they took such a long time to release it to the masses, as I'm sure it has lost some appeal at this point. Nevertheless, a great film in a great format.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|To begin, Avengers is awesome. I am so happy I got the super-enormous-combo-pack for it because I wanted ALL the extras. It was also great of Amazon to have all the different combo DVD/Blu-ray packs listed to show what was included in each, in a CHART, because that made it much easier to figure out which one I wanted.<br /><br />However, it would have been nice to know that some of the extras are ONLY available on the Blu-ray discs, hence why those extras are only available on the combo packs that include the Blu-ray discs. It's possible I should have assumed this, but I didn't, and now I will need to get a Blu-ray player at some point in order to watch most of the extras.<br /><br />Other than this, though, the movie was great, the products all worked as they should, and I'm completely satisfied with every step of the purchase and receipt process from Amazon.
1451695195|3.0|This book was a quick easy read but lacked the detailed information that I was looking for about Heaven. He kept saying everything he saw and learned but never really gave many specifics as to what everything he learned was. I was looking for more specific details and experiences.  It is worth reading but lacked the detail that i was hoping for. Glad I read it and would recommend it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I hate self help books. I never read them. I decided to read this because my husband and I are going through so much hectic stuff that I don't want to lose the spark. Our real estate agent recommended it to me. I absolutely positively loved this book. It only took me a couple of days to read and I have a 4 month old son, a full time job and no time in between. I read it while pumping breastmilk on my little pump breaks.<br /><br />I am so excited to go home and try the activities that I could just burst.<br /><br />I should add I have a bachelor of science in psychology; not because it was an easy degree, but because I am avid fan of conditioning and reinforcement - this is right up my alley.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not what I expected at all. Funny, yet intriguing. I'm not one to reach for a murder mystery, but this one kept my attention until the very end. I especially appreciated the realistic ( sometimes too realistic) dialogue.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|In the very beginning I was getting so annoyed with the back and forth of the relationship, and I almost stopped reading the book, but as soon as I said I was done reading, something happened in the book where I just couldn't put it down. I'd say the very last few chapters in the book possibly make it a better read than the 50 Shades trilogy and I canNOT wait until May for the last one to come out!
B00846REIS|3.0|Good read, but too similar to 50 shades of grey.  Sylvia Day did do a nice job writing the book, it keeps you interested!

B001VKSPVE|1.0|Watched this movie because it was directed by Spielberg. Unfortunately, even Speilberg can't fix a dumb plot. It was hard to sit through, but I forced myself so that I could honestly say that I'd seen the entire video. This is not something to waste time or money on.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|RUSH is my all time favorite band and I have several DVD's of them. This one is an awesome performance. They not only played their music but they had skits that made it more enjoyable. I will be on the lookout for more to add to my RUSH DVD collection.

B0013O123Q|5.0|For all of those who have said that this film goes too far and shows too much:  Congratulations, you are human beings with a working conscience.  Unfortunately, stories similar to this play out in real life every day, I think the thing that is most disturbing is the break from what we expect in cinema.  When we watch a movie we want an escape from reality.  We want something that could never really happen or is so over-dramatized that we can use it to escape our world.  This film shoves  one hour and forty minutes of reality down your throat and offers no escape other than the stop button.<br /><br />From a film making stance: This piece of art is genius in its purest form.  Sure, it borrows some style points here and there, like the reverse storytelling similar to Memento, but it is used in such a way that I was glued to the screen.<br />Another point of directorial glory is the camera and editing work.  Almost all the way through, there is not a single discernible cut or fade transition and really makes it seem as though the entire film is done in one long take.<br /><br />One reviewer recommended watching this film alone.  I agree, the emotion and raw humanity at its worst and best are not exactly date night material.  Plus, there is subject matter that in order to truly experience it, you must be free from the emotional influence of others.<br />The title of this film is such an fitting metaphor,aside from the obvious reasons, you will never be the same. You do not just watch this film, you experience it!
1400032717|1.0|In The Curious Incident, Haddon takes a good idea and mangles it so profoundly that despite me wanting to like this book, I have very little nice to say about it. The Curious Incident is a first-person narrative that tells the story of Christopher, a developmentally challenged boy who takes it upon himself to solve the mystery of the murder of the neighbour's poodle. There's no denying that my opinion of this book is heavily influenced by my experience with my own brother, who has autism and other developmental disabilities. Admittedly, Haddon does provide some fascinating theoretical insights into the thought-process of his narrator. However, the different way of thinking seems to define Christopher. There are no redeeming qualities to this character. It is as though he is incapable of experiencing kindness or love but only goes through the motions of determination and fear. Christopher is essentially robbed of his humanity and his mystery condition becomes the character by itself. In a landscape of an underdeveloped genre of literature, Haddon seems to create some unfair perceptions and conceptions of people living with autism or similar disorders. His thinly-veiled social commentary delivered by his narrator also detracts from Christopher ever becoming his own fully-developed character. I'm not going to say this book should not be read, but if it is, the reader should at all times treat this work as complete and pure fiction with little foundation in reality.
B00288KNL8|4.0|The disk for this movie was so scratched that it messed up the playback of the movie and skipped over parts. It's not too bad that it's completely discouraging though, so I still watch it. I'm very glad I bought this movie because it's very well done and a good adaptation from the book.

Only this 2012 season did I finally find this lantern that is brighter than my dual mantle and is decent on the battery life. It also has a nice hanging hook on the butt that makes tent and sunshade hanging really easy. The only down side is I don't have anything to put on my propane tree anymore.

I find Nicholas Sparks related movies yo be overly sappy, but I genuinely enjoyed this one. I actually ended up watching it the next day as well (forcing my husband to watch it with me...he enjoyed it as well). I would definitely recommend this movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Mr. Stein did a wonderful job of capturing what many of us who own dogs feels are their ability to understand much more than we think.  Although the story has some sad and tragic parts to it there are some really fun chapters like the one where he takes the dog into the race car and they test drive a car at full speed giving the dog a thrill of his lifetime.  Intertwined in this story are so many funny yet insightful thoughts made by the dog, it is an easy read with a somewhat expected outcome and ending.  I would highly recommend it.

Very nice to see her picks here (a couple of them are my all-time favorites, like Mom's Apple Cake), in a sort of \\"best of\\" format, with some lovely photographs.<br /><br />So many cookbooks anymore don't get proofed or vetted and contain major mistakes or recipes that just do NOT turn out right. I've never had a recipe from the Smitten Kitchen blog fail me and I feel confident that none of these will, either.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|The final chapter in the epic series... Fantastic film for all ages and it's one i can watch over and over again with the kids.
0375507256|3.0|It took only a few pages to realize this book is written in the postmodern style I've yet failed to appreciate. As a group, these novels are cynical, overly erudite in places, with too much attention to the story's voice and not enough to the remaining characteristics of good novels, i.e., sharp dialogue, tension lessening scenic depictions and  broad narratives. And Cloud Atlas fits perfectly in the bullseye of such a description.<br /><br />It's a difficult plot to summarize, but I'll try - in a hundred words or less. The book begins and ends in an epistolic account of the relations of South Sea islanders and whites in a particular century of European colonization. Then there's more letter-writing, between composer Robert Frobisher to a friend, Sixsmith, concerning RF's 1930s alliance with a famed Belgian composer Vyvyan Ayrs and his family, followed by some seesawing time changes in which big corporations are hiding their screw-ups, even as they're screwing over the people of the planet. This begins a slow slide into apocalypse in which tribal life returns, but with some vestige of technology. Shades of Plato's Republic!<br /><br />First, I'll be nice and say I admire Mitchell's imagination, his vision for such a monumental work. Clearly, much thought has been put into this work. Each of the several segments contains excitement, suspense, and many elements of a good mystery. Kudos for that.<br />But his dialogue, while sizzling in places, seems a one-note samba emotionally, and in one section in which he resorts to a made-up dialect, it's downright distracting. His various narrators' voices overwhelm any stabs he might have made at setting and complementary moods, and overall the text is a sprawling affair that often invites boredom. If you haven't read the book but plan to, my advice is to read fast. Either that or tie a flotation device to your ass to save you from drowning in the book's pretentious depths. Okay, that's pretty snotty - I apologize.<br /><br />Still the book is worth reading. Mitchell has a grasp of many of the implications of modern times' so-called progress. As he writes near story's end, \\"...one fine day, a purely predatory world shall consume itself...Is this the doom written within our nature?\\" Surely this question must be asked, over and over, in as many ways as possible, as Mitchell tries to do, if the human experiment is to be worth its existence.till the book is worth reading.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|I loved this book, fast read that tranported me to the beginning of life and every minute in between.  The choices you make are so very important and every little one affects some other part of your life.  Makes you think what, you really want or need in life, is really so trivial next to life itself and the joy it can bring.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|The book makes clear where Townsend stands on a lot of issues surrounding the Who and how it fits into his world view. He admits that his editor cut down the thousand page draft into a more manageable 500 pages. There are the expected story of the deaths of two founder members (Entwistle & Moon) who seemed destined to the sad role of rock star, drugs, and death. More surprising are the other people in his life who died and who affected him more (Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones comes to mind). In the end it is difficult to gauge how much the ravages of drugs and booze affected Townsend, booze rather than drugs appear pretty constant in the story. He reinforces the view I have held for a long time that the Who are the vehicle for most of Townsend's music and Daltry is clearly the voice he often sees as showcasing the songs. I do have a lot of the solo stuff by other band members and it reinforces the foundation of Townsend as the major song writer. One of the more interesting aspect is the story of the different rock operas and theme collections that go from the heralded Tommy and Quadrophenia to the Iron Man and the failed Lighthouse project. I enjoyed the book and felt I learned some interesting things along the way. I don't know how much of an audience the book has with people unfamiliar with the music. Townsend is clearly a creative person with huge flaws that he is open about displaying.

0743454537|4.0|This book tells the story of a family with a terminally ill child through multiple points of view. The book really held my interest and was fast-moving. The author conveys the frustrations the other characters feel about the 13-year-old daughter's wish to sue her family. Her motivations are unclear and her moods change constantly. While the daughter's actions are realistic for a teen, I felt that her language was not. This was one weak spot in the book, as she often spouted comebacks or phrases that seemed too glib and adult. (Saying this as parent of a pretty sharp-tongued 13 year old). Overall, this was an engrossing read with a couple of surprising twists at the end, which I won't reveal. I could easily see this becoming a movie. The book brings up difficult issues which would make it an excellent book club read, and I think any parent will find it fascinating.
B0058Z4NR8|2.0|Interesting point of view and concept indeed, but, IMHO, it could be stated in less than a hundred pages.<br />The same concept over and over again is not enough justification for more than 500 pages.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have been a fan of DeMille for a long, long time. When he is good he is very good and when he is not the book is irritating. In the Panther the plot is not plausible and the main character is much too flippant. It was funny in Gold Coast, not so here. I just did not get any sense of reality with the characters or situation. I could not suspend disbelief while reading this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love these type of games and this is a good one. Play is simple yet challenging. Hope for more levels.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game!! It is so addicting and I play it for hours!! Definitely get this game!! What are you still doing get it now!!! GO BUY IT!! IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT!
B000005RUV|5.0|It's kind of dumb writing a review on an 80's cd but I purchased this as a gift for someone a week ago and ended up getting another one for myself.  I had forgotten how much fun Wham's music was.  I have George Michael's double cd because I love his voice -- I have always been a fan.  But this cd is just plain fun -- every track rocks.  I found myself dancing around my living room -- hate to admit that -- but if you want to get in the party mood this cd just puts a big smile on your face!!  Glad I got one for me!  Say Wham Bam!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|great book started like all the other Seal team books ive read over the past year or so. I found that i couldnt stop reading and had it done in 2 days. No sleep
B003B02O14|4.0|Grisham does it again.  When you think you have it figured out he will throw in a twist.  Great read as would be expected. Intriguing characters and captivating plot.  Enjoy!
B009AMAM9S|4.0|Trying to make some movies, big movies, work is like trying to catch a whale with a rod and reel. It's not easy to do and herein lies the problem with \\"Cloud Atlas.\\"<br /><br />Here's the scoop. The viewer is taken through several stories, spanning several centuries, that show how actions at one time can effect things further in the future.<br /><br />To say this is ambitious in both concept and scope is an understatement. At a nearly three hour running time it took both the Wachowskis and Tow Twyker to direct, with four writers and a cadre of producers. There were even multiple set and costume designers. The effects budget alone could run a small country for a year. But, as much as I liked it, and as much as there was to like, it lacked emotional punch. At the end, given the content of the stories, I should have been emotionally strung out but I wasn't. In one story, a female looking android, discovers the secret that old androids are processed to feed current androids (there is a nod to \\"Soylnet Green\\") and she somehow becomes a martyr and near deity for centuries to come. I didn't feel a thing. This was true for all but possibly one of the stories.<br /><br />I haven't read the source material by Mitchell, which many seem to like a lot, so I can't comment on the faithfulness the movie shows to the book. But again, this is a sweeping epic with a lot going for it. It's a visual as well as conceptual feast. Scene after scene will burn itself in the viewers memory. It was a bit distracting to try and peal away the makeup to see who was playing which role, and some of that makeup was pretty awful, but that's a minor quibble given everything. I will probably add it to my library upon it's Blu-Ray release, but it's just that bit short of being a truly great film. Do see it. Films of this magnitude are few and far between. Just be prepared for a mental workout and an emotional letdown.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|I bought a blue ray player just for this movie  - 7 hours of extras!<br />I see now that the extras are are just on blue ray now a days :(<br />Did I say 7 hours of extras OMG love it<br />Never mind the haters I saw this movie 3D Imax and loved it and this blue ray is awesome. Ridley Scott is a genius and a graphic artist as well. I would love to buy one Page of his story board drawings from this film - such great talent just drawing scenes!<br />I have the 10 disk brief case Blade Runner dvd - I would so get whatever Mr Scott wants to put out for Prometheus<br />Not going into content since there are 100's of blogs on that  out there anyway :)
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I am not a sci-fi fan, but I liked this movie.  The girl in it really makes you want to go work out after the movie.  I think the special features make it so worth owning a copy.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I have only watched the blu-ray copy so far but this move is fantastic if you like you are a fan of the Avengers line of movies.  They did a great job of combining and highlighting all of the characters.  Lots of action and humor.
B007704HO6|5.0|James Bowen's account of how he saved ginger tomcat Bob -- and how Bob saved him right back -- is a heart-warming story of pure, altruistic love between one man and his moggy, and that they've now become a media sensation (with a book deal, to boot!) rekindles hope that maybe the world isn't completely a terrible place after all.<br /><br />If there's one message to take away from their story, it should be this: your pet doesn't need a price tag or pedigree papers to be priceless. We should always adopt a rescue animal or a shelter pet -- or take in a waif or stray from the street. I marvel, wonder at and applaud the modern-day miracle that is the partnership of Bob and James. Love it.
B000002AGN|5.0|Another fantastic Dave Brubeck Quartet album.  I have several of their albums on vinyl that were from my dad's record collection. Highly recommend this if you are a fan or if you have never listened to Dave Brubeck yet.
B008NEMN0K|2.0|Amazed to read some others found the 3D conversion suitable on I Robot.<br /><br />I am using a top of the line blu ray 3D player and a new LG TV and I found I Robot to be a big disappointment and a very bad sign of where 3D (conversion) is headed -- studios using the cheaper conversion option and movies having little depth and no pop-out whatsoever.<br /><br />The funny thing about the I Robot conversion to me was the small on-screen menu that would appear when prompted was the ONLY popout in the whole movie and the sad thing about that is that it immediately and constantly shows you and reminds you of how the movie COULD have been.<br /><br />I do think the 3D version of I Robot is better than just the bluray experience BUT when you watch other 3D movies like Titanic and Avatar you'll see a day and night difference. At least I sure did.<br /><br />To all studios: I will be re-thinking future decisions on 3D purchases if this is what you'll be offering us. What I see in I Robot is not worth the $30 pricetag at all. It's an amazing and entertaining technology but you are going to miss your opportunity if this is what you'll be offering us.
B008KWHKGM|5.0|Very excellent album and worth a listen.  I highly recommend the deluxe version which comes with the live show because that live show is fantastic.  I also purchased the vinyl album which came with a hi rez mp3 version of the album.
B003G4W49C|4.0|So the author is a total wanker bigot that supports discrimination because of his narrow minded and cult-like `religious' beliefs.  But, unlike how this vile piece of trash the author is in real life, I am not going to let that influence my review of Ender's Game...<br /><br />In the future, the human race was attacked by an alien race.  The `adults' in the future are idiots.  I am surprised Humanity could withstand not just one but two attacks against the aliens who have never attempted to communicate with the natives.<br />Because of the current policies of keeping the people ignorant by cutting funds to public schools and higher education, it does not surprise me that Ender (age 6 at the start of the book) becomes the final hope of Humanity. Humans have lost their ability to think for themselves let alone `think outside the box' for some reason and have resorted to recruiting young kids into Battle School.<br /><br />While this book is classified as Science Fiction,I can actually see this happening not too far into our future.  Only the extremely ignorant would think Earthers as the only space-faring species in the galaxy.  Of course, when you get into the story, you realize there are exactly TWO space-faring species. Yes, much more believable then simply only humans traveling in space...<br /><br />Honestly, I was told to read this book when it first came out in 1986.  I waited all this time to finally pick up this book and while I did enjoy the story, just seeing all the subsequent books that has been published since Ender's Game, I am wondering if the Author is just trying to fill his bank account instead of telling a good story.  If and when you read the follow-up books (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind, Ender in Exile, and the myriad of books told from other character's perspective) I am thinking the follow-up stories is less about Ender.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|Purchased product after reading reviews on Amazon (great sources for information and reviews). Product arrived and with great excitement I spent hours trying to balance a Canon HF G10. I was so very close to having the center of gravity just perfect, but never reached success. Since the product does not come with any directions, I used the web-based videos for the Merlin as a guide. The concepts are easy to understand and I have spent countless hours over five months trying to get this thing balanced. I just can not get it balanced. One thing that may be problematic is the folding part of the arc which is made poorly. This section has a significant amount of play and if you cause it to shift (lay down the product, sit the weighted end on the top of a chair or towel, the balance will be waaayyy off and you get the pleasure of starting all over in your attempts to balance the product. There are no position marks on the product. I attempted to use tape and mark locations (scotch tape and a sharpie). This helped greatly over time to track approximate locations. Ultimately, this product sits in my closet unused. I plan to sell and move to another product. I am an incredible patient person and actually love to tinker with techie type products. This is one I simply could not get to work. If you elect to buy this product, be warned, balancing is very challenging and it requires constant adjustments for even the slightest bump.
B008ENA74E|4.0|Thanks to Mr. Smith, we have a first person's account of what EXACTLY goes on inside one of the biggest \\"Banks\\" in the world.<br /><br />Although I would never be a customer of Goldman Sachs, it does concerns me that if antics described in the book is happening to individuals of wealth and corporations (those who should know better!), it probably does happens to small time retail customers at 'smaller' institutions!
B002R27J1W|5.0|This movie is slow at first, but just for the last 15 minutes, its a movie I'll watch over and over again. Psychological thriller and will leave you feeling a little shaken at the end of it.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I've got to admit that I've never quite liked the movies as well as the books, the adaptations always change too much. This one's no different in that almost every element is at least a little different than what Stephenie Meyer wrote in the related book. I did notice in BD part 1 that some of the small details, such as during Renesmee's delivery were there but not explained, which will possibly confuse someone who hasn't read the book, (it's still bloody though).<br />I got the two disc edition, everyone should, for the extras- and found that what few deleted scenes there are will be found buried in the documentary feature (Alice calling Bella, Edward showing Bella how many eggs she'd eaten during honeymoon serve as examples) and that there are no music videos.<br /><br />It all looks very good, will probably satisfy most fans and irritate the critics, worth viewing. At least one review bashes the producers for splitting the story, I think that was one of the best moves they made- too bad we've had to wait a year for part 2.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a great game that gets progressively harder. Great problem solving way to spend some time. I recommend this one to anyone that likes using their brain every now and then.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This was a great movie.  Though it was Hollywood, I think it still captured the turmoil and temperament of the time.
0446580848|4.0|I, too, have read all of DeMille's books.  By far, Plum Island was and remains my favorite.  I sat in O'Hare airport reading that thing and was laughing so hard, I was crying.  Everyone was staring at me and asking \\"what are you reading???\\"<br /><br />Anyway, The Panther is another good one by DeMille.  I was captivated with the entire story.  And as always, I love DeMille's humor.
1881273156|4.0|Helpful discussion on the five ways to show your love to your spouse. Author has several examples to support his claims but there is no scientific documentation to back up his hypothesis. In my own experience life is not so clean cut and succinct. I found myself identifying with several of the types of love and couldn't even say for sure I had one that was dominant. I bought the male version for my male spouse but he has put it in the pile of to reads and unfortunately what I gleened from reading my book will probably be forgotten by the time he reads his book. Therefore, although it was an interesting, quick read one shouldn't buy it in hopes of fixing a broken relationship unless both parties are interested in working at it.
0071813721|5.0|Thus was a great book offering a lot of insight and perspectives that I may not have thought about previously. I recommend this book to anyone running social media for a business. Can't wait to read Dave's new one!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Good read, but The Lion's Game and The Lion were better, Corey and Mayfield still had it together. Interesting ending.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|A good, comprehensive look at the Pi. In some ways, I think this doubles as a pretty good intro to Linux for the newbie as well.
B001NLL0RW|4.0|I really enjoy all the books of Mr. Rollins that I have read.  His ability to use real science and then weaving that into the stories seamlessly with fiction science is really fun.  With that and the suspense, the books are very hard to put down.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|the graphics are awesome it is fun and addictive and I never get frustrated. buy it!!! it is worth a million bucks!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the puzzling part and the page tilled with color woo h00!!! I also like the fact that there are so many puzzles to choose from. In class it improves my hand eye and coordination but don't get caught
1567184855|5.0|Tis book was recommended by a fellow clergyperson.  The format integrating case studies helps validate many of the beliefs I have read before.
030759565X|3.0|I generally enjoy the smitten kitchen blog, even if most of the recipes aren't to my taste. The cookbook is the same. I don't blame the author for this - everyone likes different things. But what I couldn't get past was the baby. Every five pages, a story about the baby. Baby baby baby. It's a cookbook, not a parenthood scrapbook. Good grief.
0307592731|5.0|Cheryl's journey is inspiring and heart wrenching.  It is a crazy quilt of laughter and tears.  Bravo!  A great read!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The Life of Pi is a book I bought several weeks ago and just recently started to read after seeing the movie preview.  I was intrigued with Pi from the time he became a member of three totally separate and different religious persuasions.  The book is a non-stop read so start it when you have quiet time - it is hard to put down.  Pi's description of his 220+ days on a raft after surviving a sinking ship is detailed and leaves one feeling they are there with him.  The ending story leaves you either heart broken or wondering what really happened.  I will read it again.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|After reading this, I found myself questioning why God allowed evil like this man on earth. Jaycee is a true survivor. I skipped through the diary part, mostly, because it was about her cats. I completely understand her need to love animals during her captivity but found those sections a bit boring. Nevertheless I enjoyed her story of hope and recommend this book highly.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins is incredible!  He is detailed, specific, tongue in cheek at times and altogether rich in his intellectual paths.  Challenging to read, not meant to be scanned over. I've had to read paragraphs twice to pull out the meat of it.  If one is going to doubt the existence of a fairy tale \\"god\\" because it's just too much trouble to struggle with why the notion is foolish , this is not the book for them. Dawkins makes the reader pay attention.  No quick solutions or summary here. I started w/ the position of agnostic. I'm 3/4 of the way in the book but think I will end closer to an A-theistic position.
B0076JPX46|5.0|This is one of the greatest trilogys I have ever read.  For me, \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\" started of a little confusing, but once I got into it, I just couldn't put the book down and couldn't wait to get to volume 2. Now finishing volume 3 (Hornet's Nest), I am disappointed that there are no more volumes.  I just love it!!!

1451695195|2.0|Good Job<br />+ With Eben's technical expertise and crossing over into the heavenly realm says to fellow scientists, \\"True reality cannot be defined or explained in labs or with microscopes.\\"<br />+ Once again, another NDE that there is proof that heaven is beyond religious texts, misused and spewed by religious fanatics. It's refreshing to see that not one particular religious organization will get the prize when they die.<br />+ Eben's storytelling of his connections to his friends and loved ones was a nice touch.<br /><br />Oops<br />- As Eben gave a thumbs up to Robert Monroe's Hemi-Sync audio material, there wasn't enough help on spirituality.<br />- After the chapters, there's a section in the book named Eternea.

B009OZ690C|5.0|Episode 8.02 \\"What's up,Tiger Mom?\\" is my favorite of the four episodes aired this season. There wasn't much artificially constructed tension between Sam and Dean as there was (to me) in the S8 premiere, the Purgatory flashbacks were well done (although I'm NOT Cas fan) and there were a few intriguing moments that Sam did (quick reverse exorcism) and a possible increased antagonism between Sam and Crowley that might show evidence of more contact between them than Sam is admitting to Dean at the moment.<br /><br />Even though Sam and Dean were not completely in step regarding Kevin and his mother, their conversations felt more natural and in character. I just hope the Sam incidents in 8.02 were not \\"red herrings\\" and there is more to Sam's storyline than just hitting a dog, getting the girl and having picnics.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I love having the Spanish and French versions of I Just Can't Stop Loving You and a few other songs that have not been heard before plus all my favorites from the original BAD.
B009SRJAG6|3.0|I gave Supernatural 8.03 Heartache only three/five stars because Dean was again raking Sam over the coals for not hunting and saving people (and not caring) during his \\"year off\\" which is exactly what Dean did (or didn't do) during his year with Lisa and Ben.<br /><br />I also wasn't overly fond of the MOTWs, except the \\"babbling\\" police guy inmate who felt so guilty that he put his \\"donated eye\\" out was quite good as was Sam's contacting the prof from Season 7's \\"The Slice Girls\\" for help on the case along with Dean's enthusiam in using his \\"translation ap\\" for the first time. I thought the actress who played Randa (who received \\"Brick's heart\\") was over the top and just one of the few bad actors/actresses the show has used.<br /><br />One of the good parts was the end scenes (Sam and Amelia) as well as Sam's little smile at the memory but there was far too little - if the show wants to give a valid reason for Sam to give his heart to Amelia they have to show more than 15-30 second soundbites of their life. Of course if Supernatural does that it runs the risk of being too soapy as was my (and a lot of fans) criticisms of \\"Dean's year off\\".<br /><br />Jensen's directing was pretty good given the blah script. .
B00913DPW2|1.0|I wouldn't mind trying to solve the puzzles, if I knew what I was supposed to be doing.  no hints, nothing to tell you what to do.  frustrating and a waste of time.
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|Supernatural Season 8 is not starting out well for me. I disliked the premiere 8.01 - Jeremy Carver seems to be totally out of touch with most Sam Fans desires to have the character presented in both a sympathetic light and heroic light; I will never support JC's decision to have Sam not look for Dean and not even try to rescue Kevin. Even if fans find out there's more to Sam's storyline than Amelia and organic produce during Sam's year off, when if ever is it going to emerge - in episode  8.20 ??? and by then will fans even care? (The more major issue is why would Sam feel the need to be secretative if he did try and fail to find Dean and rescue Kevin.)<br /><br />I only loved 8.02 so far, although the premiere did have a few good moments (music, Dean's appearance, Benny - I like \\"shady characters\\"). I gave 8.03 Heartache 3 stars.<br /><br />I loathed 8.04 \\"Bitten\\" - I dislike the shaky cam/found footage genre with a passion and the story line was like a very bad episode of \\"Teen Wolf\\" meets \\"The Vampire Diaries\\". I rated \\"Bitten\\" (on forums) 1 star (Awful). The only reason I bothered watching \\"Bitten\\" was because I liked all three of writer Robbie Thompson's  Season 7 episodes. I knew before it aired that 8.04 would be \\"Chronicle - like\\" and Winchester lite.<br /><br />For the first time since Supernatural started - I've been watching since the show's debut in 2005 - I'm considering bailing on the show if I don't see Sam taking a more active role and evidence - soon - that Sam is keeping secrets of his own from Dean that don't involve Amelia but do involve hunting of a sort.
B00138GY5I|5.0|Cake grows on you -- the more you listen the better it gets.  This was a 5 dollar special offer, so.... why not?
0345347951|3.0|I'm a fan of Arthur C. Clarke and I'd read about \\"Childhood's End\\" for years -- what an ingenious plot-devise it was to have the aliens look like devils. So I finally ordered a copy from Amazon. Frankly, the book is over-rated. Especially disappointing is the book's ending -- on Earth and humanity coming to an end because of the sudden \\"evolution\\" of homo sapiens into a new species with extraordinary paranormal powers. Readers should know that Clarke wrote \\"Childhood's End\\" when he was fascinated with and believed in the paranormal. He was even captured by the charlatan Uri Geller. By 1992, Clarke had become a complete skeptic.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book - many twists and turns keeps it interesting.  Really makes you think about who you associate with in your personal relationships.
B00846REIS|3.0|This was okay. I just wasn't feeling it.  It wasn't anything I have not seen or heard before.  I did not feel any connection with the characters at all.
B0082KPF32|5.0|This is an album that had it been made before Cynic's epic \\"Focus\\" or other equally jazz/fusion tinged extreme metal albums of the late 80's or 90's, metal heads wouldn't have known what to do with themselves.  This is a great example (among many) of jazz/fusion interspersed with metal -injected with melodic sense and then given a great production job that doesn't make it sound \\"modern\\" (a term of derision among metal heads) -but gives it a clear and concise sound.<br /><br />You have to really be able to appreciate fusion, classical and extreme metal music in order to even appreciate this -otherwise the music will be lost on you.  That is not to sound superior, but a statement of fact. This is not odd (like Gigan's or Tholus's output) -this is for those who can appreciate Fate's Warning infused with a heavier, more extreme sound.  There are lighter passages mixed with riff heavy sections -very much like a symphonic piece of classical music. Black metal style rasps, with clean vocals, violins, high speed double kick drumming, well written and arranged music -nope, this ain't death metal. It's something more...<br /><br />If you are into extreme, progressive metal, this IS your ticket. This is not Dream Theater (I know, I know, lay off -sorry...) as the keyboards are more backdrop than a separate solo instrument.  This is music with a vast outlook and needs to be heard to be appreciated.

A rogue, a scoundrel, a womanizer, an athlete, but also a man whose need to protect those he cares for completely humanizes him. Great movie.... The best since Goldfinger!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great Book!!<br />Has an awesome and unexpected ending.. But have given it 4 stars, bcos the story drags a little in the middle, and you tend to get bored. otherwise good read.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great Movie! One of our all-time favorites and I still haven't found a better price anywhere in town.  That was almost 2 months ago when I bought it.
B009329Y30|4.0|I enjoyed this movie even though it was a chick flick. It had just enough action to keep my interest.
B009VLX8FS|1.0|This is so awful it's hard to believe people actually pay good money for it. But then again people also buy Chia Pets. In fact it's the musical equivalent of a Chia Pet. Music for the gullible. Tin ear stuff. There are so many great artists out there why waste your life listening to this pile of cow chips. Taylor Swift is the Kim Kardashian of music. Not much talent but famous because she's famous.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I should have read the reviews more critically.  This IS a dark, twisted, sick book.  I kept reading, thinking that there would be some good, some redemption, some resolution.  Instead, Nick, a self-centered, immature, cheating husband is a very unlikeable, to say the least, protagonist.  His wife is a psycho who somehow meticulously plots against her husband, to a ridiculous degree.  This brilliantly sick person makes a class A stupid mistake, which she compounds with another stupid mistake, but creates and executes another meticulous plan on the fly.  The ending is abrupt and seriously disturbing. (Spoiler alert: They are going to raise a child together? Call Social Services now!)<br />For some reason, I thought a best seller meant a good book. I wasted a lovely free weekend and contributed to this book's bestseller status.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I am a great fan of Grisham but I must admit it is the \\"earlier Grisham\\" that  hooked me as a ardent reader. His<br />latest book misses the mark. I found the plot too convoluting. I feel Grisham should have revealed more of the facts relating to the scheme sooner rather than later. I found the story to be a \\"still in process\\" work not quite ready for the publisher.<br />Perhaps a publisher's deadline compromised what could have been a Grisham hallmark of excellence work which we have come to expect.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A touching film filled with top-notch actors, what could be wrong with that? The stories of the characters all connect in a hotel in India where they have all decided to retire. The hotel is advertised as a place of luxury and relaxation in which to retire. Not so when they get there, but they all seem to handle it well enough (except for one). Their stories, and their lives, intertwine with the owner of the hotel and his girlfriend. Judi Dench is phenomenal, as always. Bill Nighy is brilliant and so are all the rest of the cast. I recommend it highly and it's a movie I return to again and again in order to remind myself how life is not over when you turn 50, nor is finding love.
B004XQO8VO|5.0|This is not a review of the film. This is for the people who just want to know if this is a good Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />Yes. Yes it is. I know how frustrating it is these days buying Blu-Ray copies of our favorite classics only to find out that the transfer is nothing more than the DVD (or worse) slapped on a Blu-Ray disk and now $10 more. Fortunately this is not the case with Demolition Man. There's not much as far as extras, and no special menu, but if all you're looking for is a good clean sharp transfer that really looks Blu-Ray, then you've found it.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have enjoyed all of the Jack Reacher books, but this one seemed to move a little slower than the others, although it was still good entertainment. I just hope there are more adventures from Jack Reacher in the near future.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Overall I enjoy this app. Previously I had been going to the pinterest mobile site and just looking at stuff, but with the app and membership it is much easier to keep track of all the things I want to remember. And because everything is stored nonlinear, I don't have to worry about whether or not my pins will sync. My only complaint is that this app does crash a lot on my Kindle Fire, and I have to do a forced close. Which means I have to wait for it to close out and return to the home screen, and I lose my place. I still enjoy it, though.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I looked forward to this book and it was terrific!  It is books like this that make me excited to read books again after years of abstaining and watching TV.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Easily one of the best movies of the summer. The Blu-Ray Combo pack is teeming with extras and the 3D Blu-Ray disc is AMAZING! Definite must have!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book. It has kept me in suspense from start to finnish, and I cannot wait another hour to read Mokingjay.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great book definitely worth reading. I would recommend this book to anyone. It's a quick read and an enjoyable book for all
B0000062Y2|5.0|Excellent CD, fast service. A quick process that exceeded my expectations. Will be using this service again in the future
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The detail and depth of these stories is only surpassed by the scope of the silo.  If you are on the fence don't be, buy them all right now.  Be warned you will need to clear your schedule.
B005KR6OBM|1.0|I've had to replace most of this set due to bad DVDs which are completely unwatchable - more than one too. I've replaced season 2 and now I'm going to replace season 3. It was too late to return the product. I would recommend buying the show in single DVDs. The only thing I can figure is that this set must be bootlegged.
B006H4DBA4|4.0|Very clever story.my only criticism is that it wasn't long enough. That said,I did enjoy it and am sure others will too.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I love this game I am going to go find some simmilar to it. When I got it I made everyone in my house buy it too then we all worked together to figure stuff out... and share hints I give this a5 star rating.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Loved this story- truly heartwarming which made me both laugh and cry. Fabulous love story, hope others enjoy as well.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The beginning of the Movie is totally a possibility. How we got here, how we are going.. The middle started to connect the dots. This is where the movie had a dip in belivability and nearing the end the last dot got connected. This Prequel to another series of movies was a total surpise. Will see it again in a day or two to see what I missed.<br />We are not alone... and who knows what is gonna happen.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|This is a terrific, enthralling movie that appeals to men and women of any age who appreciate intrigue and issues central to all humanity.
B009DJB8I2|4.0|The discs seem to be fine, and everything that came with them, including the promo code and the comic booklet. The only problem is a bit of a serious one, though, and that is that the box does not properly hold the second and third discs in the middle section, and when it arrived it had shattered pieces of the box in it. I need to be able to actually store these discs, so I suggest, just in case, for anyone who plans on buying this, to have separate disc holders ready.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have used the Free Version for about 75 days and this app has worked flawlessly.  Since  taking the time to calibrate to my devivice I have even greater confidence in the application.  I purchased the Pro Version fo have access to more features and to encourage the developers to create other high quality apps.<br /><br />For me this is one of a handful of apps that keep your device running w/o any unexpected surprises (how much is that worth)).  This application does it's job, requires a small amount of space and is EASY to set up.  I rarely give a 5 Star Rating...this one has earned all 5...HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I can only play through level one. After I get to the last game of level one, it just keeps repeating that game over and over. It won't let me move on to level 2. From some of the reviews I have read, that seems to be an issue on my phone, Motorola Droid X2. I hope there is an update soon that will fix the issue. I love the game, graphics are great, it just would be nice to play more levels.
0345803485|1.0|I bought the book only because it was a best seller and people were talking like crazy over the internet... i find myself in chapter 9 i just can't take it anymore... i give up. after me writing this review i'm going to get rid of that book, i'm will burn it. its a waste of  time.<br />if i get a penny for every time Ana says: \\"Oh My...\\"  \\"Holy cow\\" \\"Holy shit\\" \\" gasp, down there, lip biting\\" i'd be the richest person in the world!
B0071BY2OG|5.0|Ok I'm a real bike racing fanatic and have all Mark Neale's works, but that doesn't matter as this is a great sport movie for the uninitiated anyway.  Brilliant action with beautiful footage that will appeal to anyone that can appreciate the skill of the world's greatest racers.  Ewan McGregor is the ideal narrator yet again.  This is a highly recommended movie for anyone wanting to understand more about the current crop of talent at the pinnacle of motorcycle racing.

B009QW7HMC|3.0|This episode was kinda boring and wicked at the same time. The ending was so gruesome and setting up the new character to be so mysterious. Hopefully this episode is setting up an awesome next episode!

030759565X|5.0|I have been waiting for this book to arrive for months. Smitten Kitchen is one of the best food blogs around and if you enjoy the blog then you will love this cookbook. The recipes are beautiful, yet simple enough to enjoy any day of the week. The photos are amazing, I didn't expect any less from Deb. I love that her cookbook is not just about food, but how food is so essential in her everyday life and how she interweaves personal stories and sentiments that connect her life to these recipes. Great job! I will be hidden away in the kitchen trying these recipes for a long time to come.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|I love this series and I love Kay.  But the last few novels have really been as much about Kay feeling insecure with herself, and her relationships as about the actual plots.  I love the twists and turns that these stories took in the past, that seems to have been lost in the last few.  The guilty party was a little known character in the book and that provided for an anemic climax for me.  I still thoroughly enjoyed Bone Bed, but it could have been better.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It was ok. Too many questions unanswered. Seemed like relevance to the Alien saga a bit forced. Wish I only rented it
0920668372|5.0|The first time I heard this story was in first grade (1997-1998 school year).  My teacher read it out loud to me and my classmates.  As I read this book throught the years, it made me cry because it tells the story of a bond between a mother and son.<br /><br />Even though Love You Forever tells the story between a mother and son, I am close with both of my parents.  I love them both so much.  When you read this book, you might cry a little bit because of the mother-son bond.  This book will make you cry.  I did!
0385535147|2.0|I am a Grisham fan but this book was disappointing.  You are asked to believe some of the most unrealistic premises put on paper.<br /><br />The characters were unbelievable and the insert of the \\"love story\\" was senseless.<br /><br />Sorry, wish I could offer a more positive analysis but this book just did nothing for me judging by his past work.<br /><br />Maybe next time but this one wasn't satsifying in the least.  It was as if he was \\"phoning it in\\".
B008XG1X18|5.0|Excellent way to stay up waaaaay too late.  There are recipes, crafts, decorations, beauty...all kinds of awesome ideas in one place.  It's surfing the web on crack :)

1594744769|3.0|Jacob grew up listening to his grandfather Abe's stories of fantastical and harrowing adventures, most stemming from the orphanage he grew up in - Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. How peculiar exactly are these children? Just judging from the photos on the covers - things get really weird.<br /><br />  I had seen this book at the bookstore several times, and I was always creeped out by the photos and the premise doesn't give much away. It wasn't until I actually bought the book and really looked at it that I noticed the girl on the cover is levitating, it just made me all that more excited to find out what was going on.<br /><br />  Our main character Jacob loved his grandfather Abe and his stories about the war, and the unique children he befriended at the orphanage he grew up in with their unusual abilities. But like any child, he got older and became increasingly skeptical about how real these stories could be. It's incredible how we rationalize everything, even when there's real physical photographic proof in front of us and Jacob is no different. But when his grandfather dies in a horrific accident, Jacob starts to question his sanity while plagued with nightmares and his grandfather's last request. Piecing the fragments of his grandfather's life together, Jacob ends up on a remote isle off the coast of Wales to search for answers - but he soon gets sucked into a world full of wonders and dangers he couldn't even begin to imagine.<br /><br />  Grandfather Abe completely reminds me of Grandpa Abe from The Simpsons. He tells war stories, and each time the version changes a little bit and it gets wilder and couldn't possibly be true. Soon relatives start brushing him off and thinking he's not that mentally stable anymore. But boy are you in for a surprise when the truth about Abe's life is uncovered and how hard he tried to the very end to fend off the things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />  This book is definitely a work of art; from the eerie photos to the end papers, to the in between chapter papers and the handwritten letters - it's all gorgeous and makes this an enveloping and engaging read. Although I don't think I'll ever be able to look at the photos for more than a few seconds - it feels like their unblinking eyes are just boring into your soul, even after we get to know some of these peculiar children.<br /><br />  The story immediately draws you in with the photos, and Abe's unfortunate end, but then it lulls a bit as Jacob struggles to figure things out. But Riggs does an excellent job contrasting Jacob's life before and after these life altering events so that when he does find the orphanage he easily fits in and it just feels right that he's there. However, for me this is where the story shifted gears completely. It was no longer a creepy mystery and I just didn't feel as invested in the story as I did before. It turns into a superheroes unite to save the world kind of situation and while I still wanted to know what happens, the last half of the story ends up as a predictable set up for the sequel and left a lot of questions unanswered.<br /><br />This story definitely has a unique and intriguing plot bolstered by old fashioned photos (and apparently they're all real?) and I generally enjoyed it. I had expected a lot of suspense and horror, but I never really got apprehensive at any point. It was like listening to your grandfather tell you a story and just watching it all unfold safely from a distance.photos to the end papers, to the in between chapter papers and the handwritten letters - it's all gorgeous and makes this an enveloping and engaging read.

007174889X|5.0|The best book available for every med school student. The corrections and additions are really accurate. In the asthma you could add a GINA control classification.
0062060562|1.0|I never leave reviews but I'm leaving a review now because I hated this book.  And I never hate books so that's saying something.  It's like a bad tv show that you know is bad but just don't stop watching for some reason.  Then you get to the end of it and you're so mad you wasted your time on something like that.  (It's a really quick read so I didn't waste that much time on it but still.) I guess I expected more because this book was for a library book club and I liked the last two books we read quite a lot.  I guess if you like thrillers or really easy reads you might like this but even for an easy, entertaining, vacation read I would never, ever recommend this book.  To be fair and to put this in context, I'd much rather be reading an Agatha Christie than a book like this.  So if you hate Agatha, you'll probably love this.
B00979CS50|5.0|This is a big smouldering,shuddering recording that sees Neil at his best-with Crazy Horse.<br /><br />A double CD with 9 tracks commencing with the 27 minute Driftin' Back that also contains several other long tracks with great guitar solo's and jams that sees the band provide their best performance since Ragged Glory. Other reviews here are \\"spot On\\" and I won't repeat the information contained but I will say that this album and Bob's Tempest are the two stand out album's of the year with Luther Dickinson's The Wandering also worthy of a mention.<br /><br />If you like Down By The river, Cowgirl In The Sand and Cortez, then this record is for you.

B00AMBH70S|4.0|Now, in 2012, a NEW chapter has arrived to the Bourne franchise: The Bourne Legacy. Directed by Tony Gilroy, the man responsible for writing the previous trilogy, and starring Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, and Joan Allen, The Bourne Legacy is an action-packed, globe-trotting, entertaining, action spy-thriller.<br /><br />The action scenes are kinetic, explosive, and exciting. They feel less brutal then Matt Damon's fights in The Bourne Ultimatum, but they are in no way less entertaining. In particular, a motorcycle chase in the Philippines will grip you by the tongue and pull you to the edge of your seat, your pulse-pounding. The suspenseful, hand-to-hand fights do NOT disappoint, filmed in shaky-cam, and filled with splintering, brutal blows and chops between 2 or more combatants.<br />Action: 4.9 Stars! (Juuust short of a perfect score!)<br /><br />But the real reason why you should watch Legacy is Jeremy Renner. He gives a commanding presence to his character Aaron Cross, and of course, genuine badassery! His character is well-formed, memorable as far as action heroes go, and has a few half-decent one-liners (&#34;Come with me if you want to live&#34;).<br />Of course, the inevitable comparison with Bourne arises. What do you expect? Nobody could ever beat Jason Bourne, even Aaron Cross. But he's cool, fit, charismatic, can fire a gun, beat up a bad guy, get the girl, and drive fast vehicles. What more could you ask for?<br />...<br /><br />The Bourne Legacy is NOT without it's problems, however. I felt that Rachel Weisz's character was handled particularly clumsily, not doing much more than plot dumping and screaming during action scenes.<br />The peerless Edward Norton (who usually rules every role he plays) is given no room to shine, and plays a cliched, one-dimensional villain. And that leads me to the main problem with the film - the script. Tony Gilroy is under NO circumstances a bad screenwriter or director, but this script is too small in scope to make much of an impact.<br /><br />The core of the film is Aaron Cross trying to &#34;viral off&#34; his chems. That is to say, retain the physical and mental benefits conferred by them, without actually having to consume them. Cross and Shearing spend the main portion of the film evading capture and travelling the globe from the US to Canada to the Phillipines to perform the operation needed for Cross to viral off. After I saw the film I got the feeling that Jason Bourne could have done the same thing in less than half the time. He would have gotten in, gotten on with it, gotten it over with, and gotten out in time for dessert.<br /><br />So in conclusion, Legacy suffers from some character and script problems.<br /><br />...<br /><br />But don't let that deter you in the slightest! I urge you to watch The Bourne Legacy, preferably in HD on a big screen. It's one of 2012's best action-spy thrillers, with great action set pieces, exotic locations, (on the whole) great characters - both reccuring and original, and a stellar turn from Jeremy Renner!<br /><br />Here's to much more of the same!

Great buy and great film!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book was well worth the wait. I could not put it down. Not only were John and Kate Corey in this book Nelson DeMille brought back other old favorite characters as well.  This was a tremendous read along the same lines as The Lions Game and The Lion.  I hope he writes more with these characters. All of his books are great. I would highly recommend all of them.

0385535147|5.0|This book is a delight.  I think its Grisham's best.  A wonderful tale of a 43 year old Afro-American lawyer wrongly convicted and incarcerated in a Federal Prison Camp.  His story is a cunning combination of patience, planning, revenge and, in a way, redemption.  I was hooked on the very first sentence `I am a lawyer, and I am in prison.  It's a long story'.  A long story indeed.  Malcolm Bannister (aka Max Reed Baldwin) is an affable, intelligent, cunning, patient, imaginative and courageous character, and his story will keep you entertained, involved and riveted from the very beginning.......I guarantee it!

I managed to read all 19 of them by March, I was so bummed that I had to wait until this book was released.  It was so worth the wait.  Once again, finished it too quickly and now I am left wanting more.  Anything written by Patricia Cornwell is well thought out and a pleasure to read.

B006O6F932|4.0|The ghouls of Monster High are ready to be cool at school with this monster playset.  This absolutely huge playset includes enough space and enough accessories to make sure any child can play out her own Monster High stories and adventures with her Monster High dolls (no dolls are included).<br /><br />The set consists of one large piece that unfolds to review a classroom and a cafeteria with a bank of lockers and a balcony.  The balcony converts from a trophy room to a DJ stand - convenient, because with the addition of a mirrored \\"ball,\\" the cafeteria becomes the perfect place to stage mixers and dances.<br /><br />Flip the set around, and out back there's a casket ball hoop (and yes, a black casket ball).  On either side of the front door are reading gargoyles, atop matching pillars.<br /><br />There are plenty of accessories - play food for the cafeteria, notebooks, a cauldron for Home Ick and a specimen for science class, notebooks, locker locks, trophies, decorations, and even tiny pens.  There is also plenty of furniture for the dolls to use.  The set comes with two desks, a lunch table, trophy case/DJ stand, a rolling cart that can be used in the classroom (or for a variety of other things, limited only by the child's imagination) and bleachers so the ghouls can watch pickup-games casket ball.  Stickers are also included for decorating lockers, notebooks, and desks. The set can actually be set up and decorated in a variety of ways - which of course, is the fun part.<br /><br />I was surprised at the attention to detail.  Inside each locker is a tiny hook (remember hanging your jacket on one of those?).  But the best part (in my opinion) are the tiny little skull-shaped locks for each locker - the u-shanks really open and close!<br /><br />I actually have only two real issues with this set:<br /><br />* The advertising says it folds away for easy storage.  Which is true - the main piece of the set folds up and slides right back down into the box.  But set upand breakdown is time consuming, especially the first time; trust me, you do not want to rush it.  The instructions aren't great.  They'd be a lot more helpful and easier to read if they were in color.  It didn't help that my set was damaged when it arrived.  One corner of the main piece was bent in enough that you could see the stress to the plastic, and enough that unfolding it for the first time was difficult.  Additionally, some of the pieces (like the desks and tables) probably weren't meant to be taken apart and reassembled multiple times.  So if you don't have space to store those items intact once they're put together, be very careful in taking them apart and putting them back together later.  Trust me on this - as I was taking apart one of the desks when I was ready to put the set away, the end of one of the bars popped off.  A spot of glue should fix it, and the bit is more for looks I think, but still disappointing.<br /><br />* The furniture is really neat.  But the dolls don't want to sit at the desks or benches without some maneuvering.  As poseable as the dolls are, they simple will not sit at the desk without the legs \\"stretched out\\" in front of them.  You can see what I mean in the photo of Operetta and Jackson in the cafeteria above; the dolls are posed with their legs crossed way out in front of them, to hold them steady.  You should also be aware going in that you will need your dolls' stands if you want to pose them at the DJ stand or at the lockers.<br />Not an issue for me, but for some parents, will be the number of small parts.  The little pens and the locks are really tiny so if you have small children or pets in your home, please use extra caution.  Also, I remember how sad I would be as a little girl when I would lose the small pieces or shoes that came with my dolls.  It's a good idea to save the little plastic sacks that the bits come in to keep them together when it's time to put the set away unless you already have an organization/storage system for bits like this.<br /><br />Is it worth the price?  That depends.  Amazon's price for this set is fairly reasonable to me at the moment (at the time of writing, the Amazon price was $68.65, but that is, as always, subject to change by a number of factors).  I have seen it at other retailers for over eighty dollars, which I don't think is reasonable at all.<br /><br />Despite the few issues I had, I think this is a great set.  With a few dolls, some space, and a lot of imagination, this would make a great  addition to any child's Monster High collection.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game was fairly easy to start but ramped up nicely to captivate my attention and desire to finish the game.  It barely took me two afternoons but still felt it worth downloading.  Now playing harder levels on the next setup.  Almost crazy hard but able to finish with the \\"extras\\" it gives you.  Otherwise it would be impossible.
B007ZMAL32|5.0|This album offers some great melodic (and catchy) tracks, and what's cooler than the fact that the entire album is about Karl XII?  As a historian and musician, I loved it!<br /><br />All of the songs on this album are solid.  My personal favorites are:<br /><br />The Lion from the North<br />Gott Mit Uns<br />The Carolean's Prayer<br />Carolus Rex
B008JGSM6G|5.0|sooo this is a very fun and addicting game. although I get frustrated from time to time because I cant figure out how its suppose to go but that's just my response to my Blonde moments.. anyways its a fun game that passes time :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I first got my Fire, I was dismayed greatly when I didn't see it on the Amazon Market.  I had already purchased the game in Google's Marketplace.<br /><br />I hacked my Kindle Fire just so I could have Minecraft and am pleased to see it is now available through Amazon as well. I am an avid MC player both on PC, Xbox and my KF.<br /><br />Just to be sure to set proper expectations, here are my observations:<br />- This is not the PC or Xbox versions and cannot be compared to those versions completely.<br /><br />-This is still in semi-beta stage and this is why some things like the Nether and some mobs are missing. Mojang is going to try and bring those features in with future updates. When I first started playing MCPE, I couldn't make stone from cobblestone and the current version fixed that as well as introduced creepers and skeletons.<br /><br />- Due to the platform, your world does have a maximum size but that is to guarantee it will work on all Android devices. Even then, given the platform's limitations, the worlds are huge and multiple people can easily fit on one map and not see each other.<br /><br />- The KF version is not exclusive, so a KF User can join a game started on an Android device and vice versa. Neither the KF version nor Android version can join Xbox or a PC version.  I'm not sure if that will change in the future (I hope it does).<br /><br />Overall, is it worth it? Absoloutely!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I played this on my Pc... I was ultimately addicted instantly! And now its on the kindle my life is comeplete! Right wyn I started playing it on Pc I Thought, wow this would make a great kindle game! And now, it is! BUYING INSTANTLY!
1451650728|5.0|I was worried after reading the last several books since Destiny, that except Losing the Peace and Typhon Pac IV that I wouldnt enjoy the book and was very surprised.  It is an honest to goodness great Star Trek NG novel that gives you our favorites as we like to see them and tells a great story that has you wanting the next book now.<br /><br />If I had any issue it is that there needed to be a little more time at the beginning to bring relationships and such up to date as the story takes off quickly and leaves you wishing a few more pages had been dedicated to the personal side.  Especially with the loses in the novel.<br /><br />The book is fast paced and full of surprises.
B009CPES4I|4.0|I really loved this movie, it was sad and funny at times.  I would really recommend this to any movie lover.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It sucks. It continually takes me back to old posts and frequently freezes. I expected better from a company like Facebook, but i guess i was wrong.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this app is fun and challenging and I am wondering if there will be a bad piggies season. love it!!
B00866H7SS|4.0|Good book it is Along very close story line as 50 shades so I found it difficult to separate the two stories other than that good read easy to get into
1451627297|4.0|I am about halfway through 11/22/63 and let me just say this is exactly what I am looking for in a book. I hate to read books that make you think way too much. This book talks about a near impossible task of time travel into the past to stop the JFK assisation from happening. King is very well thought of how he wants to tell the story. Even if this is your first book that you read by him( he has written a library's worth of books)you can tell he has written for ages. This book keeps you up day and night wanting to finish, but know you can't b/c you have other things to do with your life. In all this is an extroardinary masterpiece that should be read in colleges and highschools( not anything below that because of sexual content.) So far I like this book and I hope you do too.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Well written and complete review of the progress being made in cancer research. A must read for medical staff and patients too.
B009329Y30|4.0|The movie was gripping and help my emotions captive from start to end. I would recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys stories of love, loss, fate, patriotism.
1476712042|1.0|The only interesting aspect about this novel was that Travis had tattoos. There was no substance to it although I didn't realize it was contemporary romance when I got it on my kindle. Waste of money.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|Interesting Idea. Could use some refinements but I do like it. We have fun playing it. The say in the manual, you can make up your rules. Yes I can thank you!. That is sort of a cop out but you know I get the point. Be Creative.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|This was a great read.  I thought the book was very honest and also very interesting.  Brought back some good memories.
B009439HEY|5.0|I am a big Steve Hackett fan. He's been in the midst of a creative peak for a few years now. This album capitalizes on that inertia. Of course, I was big on Genesis back when I was young. When I threw this CD on my expectations were mixed. While I was somewhat ambivalent listening to \\"Supper's Ready\\", when it got to the \\"Apocalypse in 9/8\\" section things really hit a good stride. The album never let up from there. These are fantastic cover versions played relatively close to their original arrangements. Steve's guitar work is superb. I recommend this to any fan of Hackett or Genesis or Progressive Rock in general!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|AWESOME!  This show is great!! Have Dish and was without AMC for the 1st episode of Season Three, was able to buy it for $ 1.99, works for me.
B009YDAUJ0|3.0|Definitely love the Walking Dead series.  Amazon still has some catching up to do in the streaming business though.  It paused a couple of times and we have some quality cable internet speeds at the house.  Netflix is still the leader, but I admire Amazon's efforts.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Waste of time and money<br /><br />She should have stuck to wizardry and fantasy where she was brilliant.<br /><br />Sorry I got sucked in to buying this book
B000002MIY|5.0|I like the music.  Heard some of his songs a few years ago and bought two albums.  I enjoy listening to the music every chance I get.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie came to me in very good condition.This is a great war movie with aliens trying to take over the World.When I first recieved this movie it stopped part way into it and I tried to play it in both of my DVD's and it stopped in both of them.I called Amazon and explained the trouble I was having and the Vender sent me a e-mail telling me that they were sending me a replacement for the one I was having trouble with and they was also sending me a envelope to send them back the one that was not working as it should.The new movie arrived in two days and I sent them back the first one that I recieved.I am very satisfied with the way this vender handled my problem.I would buy from them again.
B000002KXV|5.0|I have Kamakiriad, the best album.  All the music on this album is good too.  Easy listening music coming from a musician that played for Steely Dan.  Personal likes and taste.  Waiting for another album.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I can't say enough about this book.  I couldn't put it down.  From page one it was so very interesting and the historic part was so accurate.  I took it on holiday with me and as soon as I returned I purchased the second book in the trilogy.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book was outstanding as were all of his novels.  The humor level reached an all time high.  I didn't want the book to end.  Hopefully, he is busy writing the next novel.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book is wonderful and I just hope J.K. Rowling will write more like it.  From page one I was \\"spellbound\\" and did not want to put it down for anything.  The characters were so 'real-life' and all the events were believable.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I was not disappointed! Each Scarpetta novel has proven worthy and The Bone Bed is no exception. This novel had me on the edge of my seat and left me speechless. Patricia Cornwell's writing above her competition and puts her on top! Love The Bone Bed and look forward to her next Scarpetta novel.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I loved every page of this book and read it from start to finish without stopping!!! I can't wait for the second and third
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 :<br /><br />The free version is excellent and does everything I need; but I purchased the PRO version just to reward the developers because I like it so much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the hardest books to put down! It was action filled and truly intriguing. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading Omnibus. The characters were lifelike and well thought out. It is a different type of science fiction that keeps you riveted. Can't wait for the subsequent books.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Love Diana Krall.  Each new CD is exemplary of her smooth jazz style.  It makes great dinner, house cleaning, and relaxing music.  It's a nice addition to our Diana Krall collection.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|A rookie lawyer just out of law school, barely received his law license, takes on a huge multi-million dollar Insurance corporation, suing them for wrongdoing. Rainmaker, 1995, by Grisham, is a novel that you cannot afford to miss. Although just a fiction, but in reality it could happen to anyone who is ignorant of his/her rights. Plenty of truth in this novel. And the way JG delivered, makes it even more interesting. A superb work, a page-turner, a magnificent plot, which makes him a storyteller of first grade. I cannot imagine anyone giving this work a less-than five stars.
B009CGYO0K|1.0|In due that it's a wonderful book but the lack of proper formatting makes this graphic heavy book very difficult to read as you are unable to zoom into the small print on many of the pages. Definitely avoid and buy the actual book or read the comic strip on the oatmeal.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Great variety of songs.  Glad to see somewhat of a return to their edgy and more hardcore side.  Has me eagerly anticipating the release of Dos and Tre!
0439023491|5.0|The book arrived on time and was in great shape, just as advertised!  That is all I have to say about it.
B000BMYWYC|5.0|Bigger than expected, great bond to plastic, drys quickly. Ships quickly<br /><br />I will be buying this again, great product! ,
B00018TI5E|5.0|The product was in good condition. The quality of the CD was great and it was sent to me within a reasonable time from where it was being shipped from.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Ordered these on October 25th 2012 and they were released on the 26th for shipment. Being that was a Friday the 1 day business shipping didn't get them to me until the 29th as expected. First impressions: These appear to be MUCH better made than my Turtle Beach x4's that they are replacing. They are solid, appear to be made of good material and have a nice feel to them. Included in the box were the headset, transmitter, Bluetooth chat puck, (1) optical cable & (1) USB power cable (The transmitter is powered by a USB power cable & does not plug into an outlet but into your Xbox), (1) short USB cable to plug into the headset for charging purposes when sitting on the transmitter, & (1) long USB cable to charge & play. The headset is factory paired with the Bluetooth puck so no set up required. Just hook up the transmitter with the two cables to the Xbox and go. WOW! Sound is amazing. 100% better than my x4's. They are paired with the transmitter via dual channel wireless where my x4's were infrared. IR required line of site & anybody or anything (my very large Weimaraner) walking between you and it would cause static or fallout of sound. There is NO problem like that with the Tango's. Sound is very crisp with no static, hum, popping or fallout. Since Black Ops II isn't out yet I fired up Modern Warfare 3. FANTASTIC!  These things flat out ROCK!!!!!  There are a number of presets built into the headset for different sound profiles that can be accessed by just a button push. These cover both chat & game sounds. It appears you can even program your own which I will try at some point. I have been using the presets but will experiment with all of the available options later.  Also another very cool feature is the Bluetooth is dual pairing which means you can pair it with another Bluetooth device. I paired it with my Samsung Galaxy S III with no problems which enabled me to listen to my music while playing the game and chatting. How cool is that!!!  Also supposed to be able to use your phone to make & receive calls while playing. Have not tried it yet but see no reason it wouldn't work since the music does. My son has Astro A40's and these beat them hands down. They also make my TB x4's seem archaic. If you are an Xbox gamer & and can afford them then I don't think you will be dissapointed.<br /><br /> PROS: Too numerous to list! Best headset I have ever used or owned.<br /> CONS: None at present except maybe price. But I guess you get what you pay for.to use your phone to make & receive calls while playing.

B008602KQI|3.0|Though the movie had intense action, but not Bourne Identity intense,  there was fun in it too. It hinted of a Pendragon book. Everyone says READ THE BOOK, so I guess I will read the book at some point.  I suppose like the Harry Potter books, The Hunger Games book has so much more detail than the movies can ever get into them. And I understand more movies are coming out. So, I will add The Hunger Games book to my Christmas wish list. I think it's important to flow with pop culture, so you can understand movie references, MAD magazine satire, and Saturday Night Live skits, and this movie definitely fits into that category.
0345803485|1.0|Again dont waist money time and brain in this aufully written book that has NOTHING  to justify the expense....well, maybe the beauty of Cristian, but you dont buy a book for the beautiness of an unreallistic character!!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Watch out Nelson, I may have to start comparing you to Tom Clancy, but you are right up there with him on my list.  The story moves fast and smooth with all the smart alec comments throughout the book.  Story reads true as to all the political blocks and secrets and missing ataboys to the real heros - can't wait until his next book is out as always.
B009VLXMJA|2.0|I love Taylor's music. I think she's a talented song writer with an attractive, cute voice. But this album was just disappointing. None of the songs was really catchy to me; the most memorable was \\"We are never ever getting back together\\" (wow, what a title). I am also 22, but I feel like the message of these songs (party, party, like, we're never getting back together, I said, like, party--the lyrics verge on being VERY annoying) is rather immature and doesn't address any problems young people this age have to deal with. Save your money and buy her earlier albums. And, hopefully, her next one.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've listened to this album about 5 times now, and the songs do grow on you--from any other artist, this CD would get 4 stars. So if you really want some new pop music to sing along to, this would work just fine; I just don't think it's a classic like her other CDs.
B001HN69AY|1.0|This has to be one of the dumbest written scrips made into a movie I have viewed yet. And I have seen hundreds of movies in my lifetime ,but this is just one of the most pitiful movies yet.
1582701709|1.0|For the longest time I was utterly beyond words after I started reading this book.  It's taken me a few weeks to re-compose my senses enough to post my opinion here! But unlike many of the other 1-star reviews, I'm not going to discourage people from picking up this book.  I actually ENCOURAGE it, so you can see for yourself just how absurd its premises are.  But instead of handing over your $$ in order to line Amanda Byrne's pocketbook... please, please, please instead check this book out for free from a library, or borrow a copy from a friend, or locate some free passages online.  Stick it to her!!  Now, for starters, this particular paragraph just rubbed me completely raw:  &#34;Whether we realize it or not, we are thinking most of the time. If you are speaking or listening to someone, you are thinking. If you are reading the newspaper or watching television, you are thinking. When you recall memories from your past, you are thinking. When you are considering something in your future, you are thinking. When you are driving, you are thinking. When you are getting ready in the morning, you are thinking.&#34;  Gee, I'm not sure I get the point... Do you think perhaps she might be trying to tell me that I am, ummmm, CONSTANTLY THINKING?  And then there's this:  &#34;You have two sets of feelings:  good feelings and bad feelings.  And you know the difference between the two because one makes you feel good, and the other makes you feel bad.&#34;    {start sarcasmn} Whew! I am so much more enlightened now after having read that little nugget.  I finally have labels for my contrasting feelings... and now I know how to tell them apart!  How did I ever survive before realizing this? {end sarcasm}  And to think, such &#34;wisdom&#34; keeps popping up ad nauseam throughout the book... An hour-long concert of fingernails scratching across a chalkboard is much more pleasurable to sit through than reading this kind of crap.  I don't know what is more insulting... the actual content of the book or the fact that it was even green-lighted to begin with. And Oprah!  Dear beloved Oprah!  How COULD you endorse a book that preaches, &#34;If you see people who are overweight do not observe them but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect body and feel it.&#34;  Selling this line of thinking to the masses has just as many frightening implications as the trying to sell the following: &#34;If you see people who are Jewish do not observe them but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect race and feel it.&#34;  (And we all know that the &#34;mental&#34; snuffing of Jews didn't end at just that....)  If you might be thinking, &#34;Well, that's got to be an exaggerated comparison, Rhonda Byrne is not implying the genocide of fat people&#34;, well... think again.  Rhonda Byrne may not be advocating physical genocide but she certainly is advocating the mental kind, encouraging her readers to embrace the US vs THEM mentality. &#34;Us&#34; being the thinner, the richer, the superior (or those who strive to attain such shallow niceties) and &#34;Them&#34; being anyone who is, well... not &#34;Us&#34;.  A person who tries to find their identity through such a skewed mentality can become so desensitized to &#34;them&#34; that violence against &#34;them&#34; often can and does erupt, whether it is the murder of one..... or 6 million.  And to think, regarding &#34;events in history where masses of lives were lost,&#34;  Rhonda Byrne has the AUDACITY to say, &#34;By the law of attraction, they had to be on the same frequency as the event.&#34;  So, according to this &#34;law&#34; of attraction, Holocaust victims essentially &#34;thought&#34; the violence upon themselves?  ! ! ! ! ! !  (The exclamation points are a polite substitution for what I was REALLY thinking... I have to keep my review G-rated, of course.)  Amanda Byrne must have never read a book such as Holocaust survivor Elie Wisel's &#34;Night&#34;.Or if she has, she probably did not &#34;observe&#34; any of Wisel's horrific written accounts, and instead chose to envision her own &#34;perfect&#34; book and &#34;feel&#34; all the millions of dollars she would rake in by selling it to the gullible masses!!!  But I digress...  A quote at the beginning of the paragraph about weight reads: &#34;Make it your intention to look for, admire, and inwardly praise people with your idea of perfect-weight bodies.&#34;  Are you effing kidding me?  With shallow advice like that, is it any wonder, then, that people (mainly women and young girls) end up obsessing over their own bodies and develop eating disorders?  And I can't even BEGIN to tell you how completely turned off I was when I read THIS:  &#34;Everything that surrounds you right now in your life, including the things you're complaining about, you've attracted. Now I know at first blush that's going to be something that you hate to hear...and I'm here to be a little bit in your face and to say, yes you did attract it.&#34;  Ok, I'm sorry, but if you feel you have to &#34;get in my face&#34; to make me believe what you are telling me, well, then you're insulting my intelligence.  REAL experts in REAL sciences don't have to get in anybody's face to convince them of a REAL law.  (I've never heard of a single physicist/scientist/academic professor ever having to get in anyone's face to prove the law of gravity.  Have you?)  And besides, no matter what kind of point someone is trying to make, whether it be about this so-called &#34;law&#34; or about something as ordinary as an opinion about a new movie, if it is coupled with an &#34;in-your-face&#34; attitude, I'm not going to take to the message - even if it is something I might happen to agree with - very kindly.  That whole &#34;in-your-face&#34; statement comes across as condescending and pompous.  And just a little further on down in that section:  &#34;Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it [all that is negative] through persistent thoughts.&#34;  Really?  So the pizza-delivery guy who gets car-jacked at 1:00 am in the morning, robbed at gunpoint, then gets shot and killed actually summoned the thugs to appear out of the dark right at that moment?  Now, the problem with &#34;The Secret&#34; is that the quotes I referenced above are not the only disturbing/damaging/insulting ones to be found.  The book is FULL of them.  Don't believe me?  Well, all you have to do is read the book to find out for yourself.  Last, but certainly not least, the only logical explanations I can come up with for the baffling number of 5-star reviews for &#34;The Secret&#34; are:  1. Reviewers actually wrote a negative review but accidentally selected 5 stars (if you read some of the 5-star reviews, you'll realize it's clear that some people really did make this mistake...)  2. Shameless investors/promoters of this book have inflated the number of 5-star reviews by writing bogus posts.  3. Real people are writing about their real experiences with positive thinking, but mistakenly attribute the positive things happening in their lives to having read and espoused &#34;The Secret&#34;, as opposed to the fact that they might have just had a stroke of plain luck, or, even better yet - they actually worked hard for what they got.  P.S.  Oprah... I love you and I truly believe you are the light for so many people.  I hope to see you one day take a stand against &#34;The Secret&#34; and expose it for what it really is, even if it means backtracking your endorsement.  You did it with James Frey, so you can do it with Amanda Byrne!

B009NQKXYK|2.0|It failed many ways. I've seen tv shows with better effects. Poor storyline. It is one of the two worst movies I've seen this year.
030758836X|1.0|This book is written in a bizarre approach that wanders back and forth between the two main characters and confuses the timeline of events. I found it hard to follow, and I quickly tired of reading it.  It wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention.  I skimmed ahead to learn the end. I don't think an Amazon sample via Kindle--normally a great feature--is adequate to show the peculiar and confusing read that lies ahead. I'd give this a half-star.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This book had me riveted to my seat, feeling dread for the characters I've come to love and mixed feelings for those less liked.  Many heart thumping moments.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Starts off a little slow, but before you know it this movie will grab your attention. Ill put it this way I watched it more than once and eventually I will view again. Best movie for 2012 in my opinion. Check it out.  ty,AJ
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I can't believe I paid $4 to rent this movie!!  UGH!!!  Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
B002I0J5FG|1.0|These games are terrible. They may have a unique look and story but they are not fun to play. Their are better films if you want to watch a film.<br /><br />ICO: if you like ancient game mechanics, repetitive sounds that force you to mute your sound, frustration and annoyance, this game is for you.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus: one of the worst game camera and player control scheme I have ever used. The world is visually interesting but moving around in that world is painful. The boss battles are just pure tedium. This game was a huge disappointment given the hype and nostalgia it has received.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good mix of various games.  they do have various deals that are no cost that allow you to get more games
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Amazing 3d effects.... Adds so much to the already extraordinary film on your TV.  Also comes with a 2d DVD that you can share! Outstanding buy!
1439156816|5.0|I consciously avoided reading \\"On Writing\\" for years. I finally broke down and acquired a copy of it and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Part memoir and part how-to, \\"On Writing\\" is one of the best books on writing that I've ever read. In fact, I'd put it in the top 3 books on writing that I've read. Maybe even top 2, or even the coveted #1 spot. It's really good.<br /><br />King manages to use his tragic accident as motivation to pen one of the most useful books on writing ever. He doesn't issue the normal salvos or drop cliches like you typically find in books on writing. His explanations are terse and he uses examples from his own writing habits as well as the writing habits of other writers. Instead of giving you a nuts-and-bolts how-to instruction manual, he instead approaches the task of writing in a practical and creative way, explaining the bare bones for a novice writer while leaving specifics about his recommendations to the individual writer's imagination, style, and comfort zone. What a breath of fresh air!
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|Even though this novel follows the same pattern as Picoult's other novels (a court battle) I was surprised that I liked this book as much as I did. If you're looking for a book to use in a reading group, this would be a good book. I especially liked the original music that went with each chapter, each song was a great fit for the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw the movie, and decided that I should try the book series. I am glad I did. Great read!
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Good film, pretty good adaptation of the graphic novel. The dark knight returns is one of the best story of batman. The animation was great but the only down side is that this is only part one.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I love the Gilmore Girls and this box set is everything I hoped it would be.  I'm ecstatic. I would recommend it to all fans of the show.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|We're all in this together: the key to Cloud Atlas and to understanding our place in the cosmos. We get one planet; we have to share it; and we must try to leave it no worse than we found it. Mitchell nailed it. I'll miss the people he created to populate this funky machine of a novel.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|Very poor movie.  Not coherenet.  No redeeming value to any of the characters, script, or movie.  Very, very boring...  Very disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is worth getting for. There is creative mode and survival.But I'm still not satisfied with different versions of this game on the kindle fire like the free version.I hope they add fun games that are on the i pad that we can't acess to.  I've heared that the new update on the version wil probaly be on November. Get  this game now before they rise the price for the new version!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I absolutely love this game, but I would play it more if it had endless modes and the endless jar mode. that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. quality game :)
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Another well-written book by Nelson DeMille. Always a few twists and turns to keep the reader's interest. I really enjoy the John Corey series of books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its actually very fun and addicting its better than temple run too and if u r readimg and looking a bad reveiws ignore them and get thiz game!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I love this book a long read but worth it. I love the ending and the momentum that was starting to build.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|LOVE love love this game. I play it all the time. I'm excited to see more from Angry Birds in the future!
B0086700CM|5.0|Templr Run is a great game for killing time. The achievements make the game addicting and engaging.  I imagine it is easier to play on a phone rather than a tablet.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|This isn't a fun game, and it feel's too rushed to play. I am glad I didn't pay for it.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Passion Pit really outdoes itself with Gossamer.  A huge upgrade over Manners... which was a very good album in its own right.  I highly recommend Gossamer!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very nice app not many problems perfect for waiting on things. and great for so many challenging games
B007HU7NBK|5.0|Such a wonderful book and I love the honesty and emotion that he poured out in the book.  I really value his ability to keep this book about him and not telling other people's stories.  Often rock biographies are whiny and blame others when they dont like how things have turned out.  This isn't one of those and was a pleasure to read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|needs to last longer but its a good game...I like all match three games...would definately recommend to others...more games by playrix please
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is very fun. the goals are easy to complete. the graphics are really good too.I would reccomend this game to friends.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|what a great game. the only problem I have is that it didn't last long enough! cant wait to play the next one.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is very well done. The graphics are top notch, and the soundtrack is great as well. If you enjoy the matching type games, you have to get this one. Great job developers!
0670023329|5.0|\\"Depotism\\" doesn't seem to be a suitably outrageous description for North Korea's governmental system. I guess you could call it a sad caricature of Orwell's Animal Farm. I highly recommend this book as a window into the atrocities of the North Korea.<br /><br />To me, North Korea, is a cautionary tale as to where statism can take things in some cases. And while I am by no means a foreign policy interventionist, it may be the case that separates the interventionist boys from the interventionist men. Will the interventionists spend their time eliminating hackish despots that may or may not have nuclear weapons in the next 25 years and are generally more moderate than their populations? Or will they tackle North Korea?<br /><br />The book presented indirectly through the words of the author, who narrates Shin's story. It's only 224 pages (or 5 hours if you chose the audio book format). It's an easy and worthwhile read.<br /><br />I started reading this book with a fairly completely \\"overview\\" understanding of what life in North Korea is like, even though I probably can never know it in the deepest sense of experience! Even though my \\"overview\\" knowledge covered most of what is shared here, this book was very helpful in visualizing some facts which previously were largely abstract. And I found myself shuddering at times, especially at the cold-hearted betrayal and dehumanization that stands at the very base of the North Korean system.
B0091REZMW|3.0|fun so far., but haven't been able to download the entire game. its pretty easy too but good to pass the time with especially because it's free
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was lovely to watch on several levels. The Scenery made the viewer feel like we were there. The actors each had characters with very different tales to reveal about themselves; and each story wove into the other throughout the story until the end. I felt an older person could relate to the feelings of the characters, but for the youth, I felt it was very well featured by the young hotel owner, with dreams(personal and professional) and obstacles. Obstacles were in EVERYONE'S way and somehow they were able to push each other through them. We can't go through life without help from someone(even total strangers; telling us \\"WE CAN\\" & \\"It's never to late\\" The collective talents were great to watch. Their acting experience showed. Everyone had their moment and each moment was worth watching. Even the character(s) I may not have like as much, I understood them, sympathized with them and that made them<br />easier to swallow or take in. In the final view of this movie, I really liked it. Its the sort of movie a viewer can watch more than once. I'd recommend it for a person who wants not just to be entertained, but to feel a STORY.
1416594795|5.0|Very interesting book, enlightened me about the topic of evolution and presented a massive amount of evidence that backs up the claim that evolution is a fact. A must for evolutionary biology lovers and a devastating strike upon the ill-informed creationist proponents.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The author has created a totally emersive experience in the manner of Robert Jordan and JRR Tolkien. I highly recommend this.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|My Kindle book by Nelson DeMille is a book that you just can't put down.  A fast, exciting, keeps your attention, novel that will not disappoint the John Corey fans.  It picks up right from DeMille's last thriller and doesn't let up, till the very last paragraph, with all of John Corey's, sometimes snide humor.  Lastly, and I'm sure you will also say this, \\"when is his next book coming out\\"?  Oh by the way, the cast of characters are right on the mark, you'll love and hate them all.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Ridley Scott has provided a fine prequel to the three Alien movies.  I first saw it on the IMAX screen in 3-D and it was phenomenal.  I bought it in 3-D for viewing at home and it is only slightly less visually striking.  The story is not complete with this episode which is added fun to the previous three.
B0098460O4|4.0|I won't trash this album with a low rating because Jonathan and Charlotte deserve all the success they can get.  But the arrangements and the mixing is bad.  Not just bad by professional standards, but bad by amateur standards.  First rule: never step on the vocals.  Cowell and crew didn't exactly step on them.  They drove over them in something slightly larger than an Abrams tank.  I thought that what was done to Susan Boyle in her first albums was bad, but this is worse.  I can't imagine listening to this mess and thinking it sounds just fine, although having a tin ear might make that possible.  If you don't have one, borrow one of Simon Cowell's.<br /><br />Is all lost?  Not exactly.  If you're listening to the album on a computer, download Winamp (if you don't have it) and turn on the equalizer.  It's just a ten band, but it will help.  Cut the 60hz slider the full 12db and the 170hz slider about 7db, maybe more.  That eliminates much of the low frequency droning that ruins many cuts.  I found that cutting the 14khz slider by 4db and the 16khz slider by 7db helped the sound, but that may be personal preference.  If you're listening with headphones, realize that although the headphones may have a flat frequency response, there is an ear canal resonance causing a peak at about 7khz.  You might experiment with the 6khz slider to see if that smooths the sound.  All this does nothing to eliminate the damned choir, but it does make the album listenable and in many places, very enjoyable.  After all, these kids are really good.<br /><br />If you're listening on a surround sound system, you have better options.  Charlotte and Jonathan appear to both be dead center, even when doing a duet.  They will be on the center channel, so all you have to do is cut the volume on the right and left channels (maybe the surrounds as well; I'm a two channel guy).  That should do an even better job of correcting the botched job done by the \\"pros.\\"  Alas, it sounds as if the aforementioned damned choir is also centered.<br /><br />It would be interesting to know J&C's reaction the first time they heard the finished(?) album.  After all, the accompanying noise tracks are laid down after the vocals, and the singers don't know what's about to hit them.  I'm betting tears were shed.
B009QWNQ8Q|5.0|I love this episode!  Once Upon a Time is the best new show out there.  We watch it every week religiously.
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|In all honesty, I need a good month's worth of listening to this record, day in and day out to give it a true review... but after reading the Barrettbowie 2 star review, I had to take it on myself to come with a five star review of what I feel is a true genre defying masterpiece.<br />As I stated in my rebuttal to his contrived review, none of us have an earthly fathom as to the creative processes utilized in the making of this music.<br />I promise a more in depth look at this record, say around the end of November... but as for now, it's still resonating and hardly ready for my obscure review.<br />Deeply moved by their musicianship and vibe, and dare say this may end up being their best work yet. Certainly unexpected, and a miracle of sorts in my eyes.<br />Listen deeply friends.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|This is the bazillionth time that I've seen this movie. It never gets old. I've watched it several times with children while at work, and today I got to watch it with a friend of mine. He was not too fond of the old guy but nonetheless, my friend enjoyed the other characters.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than I did fifty shades. I liked that it had a plot and not just sex every minute. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out, I've already pre-ordered it!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This might be his best ever.  If you like laughing, being tense, and not being able to put it down, buy this one!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|i love hello kitty since i was a little girl, ! &amp; im in love with this game. its a time consuming &amp; very entertaining!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is the only film I know that has made me cry every time I have watched it, and I have watched it about 7 or 8 times. Now because other reviewers have explained the story much better than I, the focus of this review will be on why I think you should buy and watch this film.<br /><br />Firstly, do you have a parent or relative/friend who tells outrageous tales of past adventures that could not possibly be true? Do they use those tales to get all the attention focused on them? Does this really irritate you, especially as they seem to repeat them continuously? Would you love to debunk them? Ah! This tale features just such a protagonist and a son determined to get to the truth.<br /><br />Secondly, do you like to both laugh and cry in films? This film will do both to most of you.<br /><br />Thirdly, do you enjoy tales that are a bit over the top? Well, this is like that.<br /><br />This is a strange, quirky movie. Its structure is definitely not linear - juxtapositions with the past abound. There is a depth about it, an allegorical feel that is somewhat transformational. The acting is good, not surprising if you read the list of actors in it.<br /><br />All in all, I love this film and I hope you will too.
1439192812|3.0|The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True might be more precisely subtitled:  What I Believe to be Really True.  Dawkins version of what is really `true' leads to a dead end science because he adopts an exclusively metaphysical materialistic view.  He fails to stimulate the intellect by his superficial treatment of the topics discussed.  His defense of science and scientific method are marred by his disdain of the fundamental role played by mysticism and perceptibly transcendent human consciousness. Dawkins' simplistic view ignores the many different kinds of reality that cannot be known through the materialistic methods alone. Karl Popper observed that \\"science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths,\\" Myths graduate to science when they are open to being tested; indeed, science rests on a bedrock of mythology. Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Kurt G&ouml;del, Immanuel Kant, and many others were mystics before they were  philosophers, physicists, or mathematicians.  I fear that Dawkins' book may be unsafe for the children to whom it is apparently addressed.<br /><br />Put aside notions of spirit, soul, God as perhaps useful albeit unprovable, unreal. Put aside all religious dogmas, theologies, philosophies, metaphysics, history, and everyday experience. Even under sensory deprivation conditions what remains is the sensation and immediacy of consciousness. Patently, consciousness exists, because we experience it. The recently-published book My Universe - A Transcendent Reality explores human consciousness with the presumption that it is more than mere self-awareness and that it transcends its physical-neurological manifestation. The book elaborates the notion that we progress in three stages, bringing order out of the cosmos and chaos that confronts us: poesy - philosophy - physics. Each stage follows from the previous, sometimes immediately, sometimes in halting succession, stretched out over time, often spanning generations. The `order from chaos' process is cyclic. Poesy may be an a priori concept, out of the blue, or poesy may be a posteriori, if a tangible physical reality is its inspiration. Philosophy is the intermediate rational phase by which a concept is expressed in a logically malleable form. Physics is the material product of the sequence. The sequence may be recast as: inspiration, formulation, realization, a process to bring order out of chaos. (page 67, My Universe - A Transcendent Reality)os' process is cyclic.

B00932A5QA|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was excited, having watched the other starship trooper movies, however when I discovered it was animation, I felt a wee bit disappointed.  That disappointment did not last, however because the story, characters, and even the animation was absolutely enjoyable to watch and intriguing to follow.  This turned out to be a great story.  Not for kids, this is animation for adults.  Very very good.  I liked it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sequels and trilogies are risky moves for some author but Sylvia Day does it again. I am left wanting to read more about Gideon and Eva. I had some idea what this book will be based on the first book but I have no idea what will happen on the 3rd one. Can't wait for Entwined with you.

B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia Day has outdone herself with this book. I have read this months ago but never got to rate the book. This is hands down one of the best steamy erotic novels to date.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|The video is dark compared to when I watched this on cable \\"Pay per View\\".  The characters, special effects and sound track is fantastic.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|For the superhero buff. Action packed, totally unbelieveable, almost bizarre at times and certainly will<br />excite the comic book crowd. Don't look for deep meaning, character development or deep interpersonal relationships. The god with the hammer seems to have been poorly casted and almost a misfit or forced character(believe it or not).<br />Will not disappoint the right audience.
0765348276|5.0|I got this book as part of a package deal, and was pleasantly surprised. The character development is great, and I enjoyed reading it despite it being about a very dark topic -- war against sometimes superior forces.<br /><br />Instead of being a shallow space-opera plot, there's significant depth to the characters, and very few convenient coincidences were used to move the plot along. A few do sneak in necessarily to reveal the major plot twist, but it's a good enough twist that I forgive Scalzi.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Normally, &quot;Free&quot; translates to &quot;Junk&quot; or &quot;Strings Attached&quot;, but not in this case. As an alarm clock, it's amazing. As a FREE alarm clock, it's even better. Even with the easily ignored ad banner at the bottom of the main screen, I still highly recommend this app. There are so many options to customize how your alarms work - you can finally have an alarm clock that will conform to your wake-up needs. My favorite options are found in the advanced settings of each individual alarm. There you can choose to decrease the alarm's snooze duration after each snooze, or increase the number of math problems you have to solve before you can snooze it again. By making it more difficult to mindlessly snooze your way through the morning, even a deep sleeping snoozer is bound to wake up on time.
B000FVE3A2|4.0|I have already received my Grand Diver, as someone said it is big and heavy but not too much, at least for me... This weekend i am goint to test it on the sea, to see how it works under the water... By now, i think it is perfect considering the price, let´s see later.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|Even as a long time fan of the band, I'm still kind of shocked at just how good this latest album is. It starts out of the gate really strong and the first 7 tracks are just dynamite. They are instantly likable like perfect pop songs that would all make great single releases. The 5 remaining tracks needed a few listens from me before I grew to appreciate them, but I do love this whole album now.<br /><br />I used to compare every PSB album, mentally, to Please, Behaviour and Very, but Elysium will now be the standard I judge PSB albums. Plus the appeal of this album is so broad, even my dad and my wife enjoyed it a lot. My dad still listens to Sinatra and my wife usually scorns all English language music, so this is a pretty big deal. I hope this turns out to be their most successful album yet because it deserves to be, and it actually has the amazing dual appeal to both long time fans and newcomers.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|works well it does what it says it will do. I like the graphics. l would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something like this.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|The final season of Veronica Mars. It should have continued. Though not as good as seasons 1 and 2, this season debuted a more mature Veronica, in college and dealing with more than the usual high school mischief. One major story arc seems to finish too soon and somewhat unsatisfyingly and the relationship drama seems forced. But overall, some good episodes and still enjoyable.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I am very impressed with this product.  Incredibly inexpensive, but exactly what I wanted: a tight (and it's really tight - hard to get on - but that's good) fitting case and a protective film.  I took my time, put the film on carefully and then had to work a bit to get the case on, but the tight fit is worth it.  Much smaller profile than most cases and mostly lets the iPhone be what it is - a beautifully designed device.
B001FB5634|5.0|This movie made me cry. Not because it is dark, depressing, grim, and terrifying - all of which it deftly accomplishes without recourse to buckets of blood, piles of gore, or CGI monsters - but because it presents the most exquisitely poignant and beautiful depiction of a father's love for his son that I have ever seen on screen.<br /><br />If you have children, you know exactly what someone means when they say they would endure anything, sacrifice anything - even their own life - to protect their child. Fortunately, most of us have never been put to this test. The Road shows us what it might be like.<br /><br />In a bleak, dark, and dying post-apocalyptic world, a father and son set off on a journey of survival. Life-threatening dangers, both insidious (the constant cold and threat of starvation) and gruesome (butchering by cannibals), lurk at every turn. We are never told what calamity has destroyed the earth, how civilization has ended, or what the father hopes to find at the end of the Road. McCarthy's omission of these details forces us to focus exclusively on how the father desperately fights against both the horrors of the Road and the loss of his last remaining shard of humanity, so that his son does not lose his.<br /><br />Watching this saga of selfless love slowly unfold is both extremely upsetting and extraordinarily uplifting. This is not an easy movie to watch - or to forget.
B00979CS50|3.0|Good old Neil is just playing the sound as he always has and simply changes the words.  If you can dig that, then this one's for you.
0307960471|5.0|Jo Nesbø's \\"Phantom,\\" expertly translated by Don Bartlett, brings Harry Hole back to Norway after a three-year stay in Hong Kong.  He has returned because eighteen-year-old Oleg Fauke, son of his former lover, Rakel, is in prison, after allegedly gunning down a friend and fellow drug addict, nineteen-year-old Gusto Hanssen.  Harry familiarizes himself with Oleg's case and Oslo's squalid drug scene.  The financial stakes have soared since a synthetic and highly addictive substance called \\"violin\\" displaced conventional heroin as the drug of choice.  It is purer, less toxic, and more expensive than its predecessor.<br /><br />\\"Phantom\\" features a more mature Harry Hole.  Our hero used to be a self-destructive drunk, but he is now a recovering alcoholic and addict, trying to face life with clarity and sobriety.  He is still a gifted and tenacious investigator who methodically takes in every aspect of a crime scene, noticing minutiae that others miss.  Since he is no longer employed as a detective, Harry relies on friends and acquaintances for help.  Most of them oblige--some willingly, others reluctantly.<br /><br />This story is, in some ways, reminiscent of \\"Rashomon,\\" the classic film about human frailty, the subjectivity of perception, and the elusiveness of truth.  In this case, we are like members of a jury who listen to conflicting testimony from a variety of sources.  In italicized passages, Gusto, the dying junkie, poignantly and heartbreakingly bares his soul as his life drains away.  He is paying the ultimate price for taking and selling drugs \\"that consume the soul, cause the body to disintegrate and send the buyer into dependency's cold gripping hell.\\"<br /><br />In addition, we meet a cast of venal, power-hungry, corrupt, arrogant, deceitful, and violent people, most of whom would willingly barter their souls for profit and influence.  Not everyone is a scoundrel; there are a few decent and honest individuals who are both compassionate and altruistic. Harry Hole is a force of nature who manages to offend, bully, and cajole his way into an investigation that is, technically, none of his business.  He pays a steep emotional and physical price for his involvement.  Readers will be open-mouthed at the physical abuse that Harry endures in the course of this novel.  Most people who are battered, bruised, and bleeding would consult a doctor or at least try to get their hands on some potent antibiotics.  \\"Superman\\" Harry grits his teeth, treats his wounds with sewing thread and duct tape, and proceeds with his inquiries.<br /><br />The author's vibrant figurative language, cutting and sarcastic dialogue, scathing social commentary, and ingeniously convoluted plot keep us riveted. In addition, Nesbø provides valuable insight into his characters' complex motives.  Red herrings abound, startling developments keep us off balance, and the conclusion is a shocker.  \\"Phantom\\" is an engrossing police procedural that, for all its bleakness, black humor, and unrelenting violence, underscores Harry's selfless devotion to Oleg and Rakel, for whom he unquestioningly risks his life.rry Hole is a force of nature who manages to offend, bully, and cajole his way into an investigation that is, technically, none of his business.

B0082RHRHC|5.0|Jane tells her own story and you the listener/reader are drawn into the scenes as an observer, feeling her pain, her courage, her deep felt love. The story is beautifully narrated and will remain long in my memory.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I expected more action from this movie.  It was pretty long and drawn out.  Not enough explanation for the general viewer while lightly touching on the \\"Alien\\" theme.  I probably would never watch it again.
0525953728|4.0|I appreciated getting an insiders view of this military operation.  The most enlightening part for me was being able to compare what the person who was there reported verses the news peoples take on the event.  \\"I guess the reporter wasn't there and had to fill in the empty spaces with his/her imagination.\\" Nice to know we're stupid to believe everything the media puts out. Liked the book however very much and God Bless the guys who put their necks out for us. And curses on the politicians who give aid to the enemies that shot down the heliocopter that held the seals in the air.
B000002UAC|5.0|Seriously, people really need to buy a clue before they write such uneducated reviews on Amazon. I see 2 or less stars in the ratings for this album stating it's not up to the standard of other seminal rock groups - Stones, Zeppelin, Purple, Who, Kinks etc.<br /><br />Let's establish something here, namely when this album was recorded  - August 1963  :  The Stones had only just been in the studio to record their debut single 'Come On'(and a Chuck Berry cover at that) for Decca. The Glimmer Twins had not yet been locked in that room by Andrew Loog Oldham to come out with something original that was decent. Yes folks, THIS was the album that convinced Oldham that songwriting by the band themselves was the way of the future. Covers were not sustainable, and he was correct in that assumption. Little Richie Blackmore was in an instrumental band dancing lame steps - a la Shadows - ina low budget film with The Outlaws (with Chas Hodges later from Chas & Dave fame. Search youtube \\"The Outlaws - Law & Order\\" to see). Jimmy Page was a session guitarist in London playing on \\"horrific Elevator music\\". The mighty Led Zeppelin were not even a twinkle in his eye yet. The Who were still the High Numbers and The Kinks had no record contract.<br /><br />So with this in mind we can do an historical evaluation to see where Rock & Pop were at at this time. ROCK as we know it had not yet happened and POP as we know was being ushered in by, and only by  -  The Beatles.  Yes this album WITH THE BEATLES laid the platform and inspiration for bands to follow.<br /><br />No, The Beatles were not the reason some these classic bands formed - they were around way before influenced by the Rhythm & Blues greats and early Rockers. But it was this album that established Lennon & McCartney as real songwriters (aeolian cadences, the greatest composers since Schubert was being thrown around after this album smashed it's way into public consciousness) and inspired the soon-to-be Rock greats to mold theirown identities and not be mere cover band acts. Merely 3 years later, John & Paul were unanimously the greatest songwriters unrivaled by anybody in modern music.<br /><br />There are some great Lennon-McCartney tracks here  : It Wont Be Long, All I've Got To Do, Not A Second Time, All My Loving, Little Child. George Harrison bats very fair with his songwriting debut 'Dont Bother Me'. Throw in the covers 'Mr Postman, You Really Got A Hold On Me, Roll Over Beethoven' and the amazing version of the R&B classic  'Money' - the ultimate version that John Lennon turned into a piece of primal therapy, seven years before Arthur Janov - and here you have an album light years ahead of any band of the era. This was the album that had young kids in Britain wanting to buy guitars and try their luck at the big time and be Beatles. This was the album that America fell in love with 6 months later, though it was titled 'Meet The Beatles' and was embellished by the soon to be recorded  I Want To Hold Your Hand, This Boy and a few from Please, Please Me.<br /><br />'Please, Please Me' was a tremendous album debut and showed undoubted promise but it was still 1950's in approach and style that did hint at something new , fresh and original. WITH THE BEATLES delivers on that promise and changed the course of modern music. I dare say culture.<br /><br />Of course The Beatles bested themselves with every release ie. every release was a progression from the last and they would soon best this with Hard Day's Night. No band under their schedule and pressure has ever came close to the work they created in a mere 7 years recording.
B00170DEM8|5.0|My friend introduced me to this movie when I was in College and loved this old movie. I love Fred Astaire and the music and dancing are great in it. It pretty old school and can tell how they celebrated Holidays in the Movie that there were no censors regarding racial stereotypes. Other than that, Its great!!!!!
0316228532|4.0|Harry Potter was not my cup of tea; realistic fiction and nonfiction suited me much more than fantasy.  But thanks to the relentless urging of my kids to read the books and see the movies, I am now an unlikely Potter fan; I think they're called Potter Heads.  So I was intrigued when Rawlings came out with a more realistic piece of fiction for adults.  I just finished The Casual Vacancy, and it was GREAT.  Just a caveat, that the first few chapters will throw out a lot of characters and back story.  Some books include a summary of characters, and that would have been helpful with this one to get all the players straight.  But about a quarter of the way through the book, everything starts blending together, and the political intrigue, plotting and conniving between the villagers build deliciously.  Almost everyone has an ax to grind, skeleton in their closet, or some petty self-serving motivation.  You may see yourself in some of the characters.  Due to adult subject matter and language, it is not suitable for children or teens in my opinion.  Many of the villagers grow a bit, some remain stagnant, and some come to a terrible end.  I find myself wanting to read a sequel to see how everyone evolves, perhaps with new characters, like a thinly disguised Snape as the new school headmaster . . .
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Good movie and streamed well through Amazon. Lots of great action scenes. That said, I have a short attention span & the movie is LONG which is the sole reason I probably will not watch it again.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|We like the Avengers. The beginning was a little drawn out, but we liked how the movie portrayed each character's usefulness. Of course, the Hulk took the cake.And especially Mark Ruffalo who starred as the Hulk.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|its an ok game... pretty much a rip off from temple run. so I got tired of it quickly. no offends.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The case for the kindle is great for the price and holds the device pretty secure. I like the elastic band that allows you to secure the front cover. My wife has an Ipod cover that magnetically closes the lid, but I like this a little better.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|this movie is so good. i rented it on amazon and was very impressed with the quality as i played it on my playstation. this is a must watch movie especially if you like original movies. the pacing is amazing and the acting is stellar.
1451695195|5.0|Great book - but lots of questions! If true, this is perhaps the most astounding, important, enlightening and uplifting story ever told. It complements, supplements and/or trumps all spiritual revelations and materialist musings up to this point in human history. If people think about this correctly (and I have little hope that the majority will), and if it can be confirmed, we would all come together and live happily ever after; this is the stuff of fairy tale; in the good sense.<br /><br />Is it real? Certainly for all intents and purposes, Dr. Alexander is highly credible. So either: 1) it is true, or 2) he is somehow misinterpreting a really strange hallucination caused by brain damage as reality or 3) he is making it all up. Personally I discount this last option.<br /><br />Is it possible that this was a strange hallucination caused by brain damage? Dr. Alexander is sure that it is not. The fact that he received validation with the photo of his sister at the end is really stunning! But I suppose it is possible that his mind (or brain) may have been playing tricks on him. A critical question for me is whether or not this journey actually did occur when his neo-cortex was non-functional as he says as oppose to being in a degraded state. He says he has time anchors which demonstrate that the majority of the really sublime experience did in fact occur when his neo-cortex was non-functional. If this journey really did occur when his neo-cortex was non-functional, then clearly, it would seem, consciousness is not reducible to material causation as materialism requires. However, even if there is some doubt about when the most exquisite elements of his journey occurred, the following very difficult question remains for those who adopt a materialist line of thinking: How can it be imagined that such advanced concepts discloses in the book which rang very true to me (there are more that are difficult to articulate) could be evoked out of a severely compromised brain?<br/><br />If this is real then virtually everything that nearly all the scientists in all the universities of all the world have been saying for decades about evolution, the brain and mind is spectacularly wrong! If there is a conscious mind apart from the brain then it must have been bestowed by some pre-existent intelligent entity--probably some divine entity. But materialist scientists are not going to like the idea that they themselves and the scientific paradigm itself could be regarded as fallible any more than the authority of the leaders of the church was challenged a few centuries ago. If this story gets traction, materialist scientists are going to wage war on Dr. Alexander.<br /><br />A few thoughts about the phenomenon of consciousness related to Dr. Alexander's experience. I have never understood how intelligent people--including Dr. Alexander until his NDE--could dismiss consciousness as a phenomenon of the physical brain. I have never accepted that for a wide variety of reason only one of which I will mention: If human consciousness were reducible to physical phenomenon then what accounts for the immutability of one's sense of self? How can it be imagined that, in Dr. Alexander's case, after the brain damage he incurred and once his neo-cortex was restored (miraculously), that his sense of self--that he is the same Eben Alexander he was before--be perfectly reconstituted? How can a physical algorithm--organic computer--account for that especially in light of the fact that his brain structure must have undergone catastrophic change? Personhood--self, identity whatever you want to call it--is constant despite radical changes in the underlying physical structure. In fact, how can trillions of firing neurons account for consciousness at all? When the best explanation offered by materialist to explain consciousness--the most real thing about us--is that it is an illusion, you know they are really grasping at straws.<br /><br />I am anxious to read more about Dr. Alexander's experience. He has written 20,000 words about it.
B00913DPW2|1.0|Would not download when compared connected to public wi fi network. Word minimum has no purpose and sucks. Additional words added for count, no information.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|It is true that everyone has an opinion and yes, I know alot of people love this and of course they should be able to love whatever they want and for any reason they want. That's what is great about being free. We can choose what we want to buy and how to express our opinions. In my PERSONAL opinion I believe this is a sad CD in more ways than one.<br /><br />First, the quality is just not here. Radio and chart success does not equal quality, and this is a good example of that. I will say one thing positive. If they only marketed this to 9 to 15 year old girls then I could see the appeal. However, they are marketing it to both country and pop radio and since those are two formats I do listen to I feel my opinion is valid. This is a very sad album in the terms of what this is doing to country music. Some will say it's good for country and I will totally disagree. Country music has been the number 1 radio format now for well over a decade and is one of the best-selling genres for a very long time, so country does not need this type of pop music to broaden its listener base. So what does this do for country? Due to the young girl demographics the executives will now jump on the bandwagon and attempt to have all new artist do the same type of music. This is totally changing what country music is and they will now be playing less of what real country fans like. I want to mention to the people who will criticize me that I actually love some pop country just not when it has no substance. This of course is all done for money. Executive will be honest in the fact that they could care less about quality. This is also sad for music in general. For those that like it that is wonderful but what happens is that when DUMBED DOWN music sells then companies invest less and less in quality music. Why would they spend time on developing real talent when they can just find a marketable image and make fast dollars. I would not care at all what Taylor releases but it does indeed effect what others will be listening to. This is a product and it's a shame we don't demand more quality in our music. Again, chart number and sales do not impress me at all. Its about the quality. I hope next time around Taylor will come up with something thats not designed only to make as much money as possible.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I was looking forward to this book. I'm a great fan of J.K.Rowling but believe she missed the mark with this book. It is more of a political statment/sociology study than a work of fiction. The story line was slow, the characters messy and there were no clever twists or turns. Disappointing!
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|the season three premiere was probably the most exciting and well written of all the shows from the previous seasons. it was exciting, edge of your seat the entire time. the zombies looked great, and i loved how all of the characters have evolved over the past several months that was supposed to pass.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Another book I couldn't put down! Gillian Flynn can't put these books out fast enough. Love the creativity put into the story, a read you will not regret, I promise.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|I thought this book was pretty good. I've been a Duran Duran fan since the early 80's, so I had to get this. For the most part, I enjoyed it. I wish some topics went into a little more depth. At the end, I felt slightly unsatisfied. I wish the photos had captions, too. That would have been helpful. An entertaining read, just wish it had a little more detail.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Book is 4  star, as well as the audio book I  purchased for this book. It also is 4 STAR.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was surprised to find the new J K Rawling book not only entertaining, but well written  I have not read all Harry Potter's books, one was enough. As her books have had such phenomenal success, it is not strange that her new book will have success too. I highly recommend it, if you like books, which begin with the death of one of her positives characters and end with the death of the second one. The book, as any contemporary novel vying for commercialc success, contains all modern ills:school bullying, the resulting (?) self-mutilation, addiction to drugs and all the modern explanation of it--poverty, maternal elect ... The admiration for promiscuity ( the characteristic of her main  character) , the disdain for middle class virtues... The comparison of the obesity of  one of a major taxpayer in the community and the expense of the NHS to treat it with the expense of the treatment of a drug addict , made by an Indian GP! (another bow to a modern novel with diverse characters!). Anyway, it is a realistic portrayal of modern England and its welfare state!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down.  Well written with engaging characters.  Will look for other books by this author.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|One of best shows out there right now and with amazons best video quality amazing.<br />There are no more words to describe the genuine Amazons Instant Video its amazing!!!!!! And oneof the best out there.

0142406112|5.0|I ordered Stormbreaker by Anthony Horowitz for my nephew who loves to read.  Before I packaged and sent it, my 16 year old son saw it.  My son is not a reader at all.  In fact he would rather do anything but read.  He said he would try it, and has been reading it ever since.  He loves the book.  I am hoping he continues on with the series.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is one of the most addicting games ever. I cant get enough..ive beat the game 4 times and still haven't got tired...if you don't like this game its cause you r lame and cant accept a challenging game...I'm ranked 13% in overall distance :)
1603420398|5.0|Very good explanations and techniques. This will be one I keep and return to time and again. Gives me new ideas each time I look through it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the third book the best.  The first one was little too much.  The ending was great and I look forward to more books from this author.
B007SGM084|3.0|I think if you take all the porn out and put all 3 books together you would have 1 Harlequin romance book.
0345536886|5.0|I loved this book. Entertaining from the first page to the last. And as many other reviewers have mentioned, it appears that Mr. Grisham is once again \\"having fun\\" as he created this story.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|Just finished book four.  Not as excited with it as with the first three.  Too many cliffhangers left unresolved, unlike the other books.  Still fascinating, just not quite as good as the others.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I've never really been much of a Tom Cruise fan, but I have to say he literally \\"swaggers\\" away with this movie! What a fantastic performance he delivers in 'Pour Some Sugar On Me'..... This movie was extremely entertaining, and was an exact replica of the late '80's bar scene.... It brought back memories I'd forgotten I had..... Rock on!
1932100660|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  The facts were presented in a way that made them clear and understandable.  The author seemed not only highly knowledgeable on the subject but a genuine human being who cares for the health and well being of others.
B000CC3SDW|5.0|I have this album in the dual disc version for years. I love it, and I found the this SACD/CD version. I know even I don't have a SACD player, the DSD CD is totally different to a normal CD. I first import it to itune and convert to Apple Lossless format. Compare to the dual disc version. This one is like 3D sound. Breathless!!<br />A lot more details and separation. I can't use much of words to tell you the difference, but if you have the another version of this album, don't feel bad to buy it again, its totally different.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I don't care if it's Rovio's fault or Amazon's, waiting this long for an update that has been made available elsewhere already is just ridiculous! whoever is responsible for the delay, and I don't care who it is, get your crap together and release it already. 1 * for extended delays of updates. cut the crap and the red tape, release the updates properly, and it will be 5*'s again. From now on, I'll just get ALL my apps from the Play Market.
030759565X|5.0|My sister bought me a copy of this recipe book.  I have read her blog before and while I enjoy reading it, I never really make the recipes.  Deb is a recipe purist.  Meaning she never takes cooking shortcuts, so if you are the type of person that only uses the freshest ingredients, spices all the time and likes making everything the longest way possible to ensure it will be perfect...this is your cookbook.  I am just too busy for this. Also, I like when cookbooks showcase the food via amazing pictures.  This does showcase the food but it also has a lot of pictures of her son. Some people may be into this, but as a person that never stares at pictures of puppies or children...I am not.<br /><br />Updated Review:<br />Based on some suggestions I went back and made some of the suggested recipes that were quicker and I have to say they turned out amazing!!! I had a small cocktail party over the weekend and made them for that.  Parties make me nervous about preparation so it was the perfect time to try them out.  They turned out great, used few pots, and the guest raved about them.  Most important, they were done quickly so I wasn't trying to prepare stuff while my guest were here.  While there are definitely more tedious recipes in the book, I recommend saving those for when you have more time.  However, there are quicker options in the book!!!  Another tip, that my sister gave me.  Days with inclement weather like our recent hurricane are ideal times to make the more elaborate recipes.
B008H6GHL0|3.0|Since Resident Evil: Damnation achieved a moderate success, the fellas at Capcom decided to do another fully-CGI movie. This one also ties into the continuity of the Resident Evil video games, and totally void of the Paul W.S. Anderson live-action franchise(thankfully!). It was animated by Capcom studios, and Digital Frontier which handles several Japanese live-action and anime movies.<br /><br />Taking place sometime after the Resident Evil 5 game, zombie survivalist Leon Kennedy is sent into an unnamed Soviet country which is in the middle of a civil war to see if either side is using BOWs(Bio-Organic Weapons)such as the T-Virus. Leon is captured by the resistance and discover that they are using a new form Plaga that allows them to mentally control the wall-crawling Lickers. Meanwhile, RE femme fatale Ada Wong is posing as UN liasion to the country's female president Svetlana, but Ada is really working for a unknown source(more than likely to be revealed in Resident Evil 6. Leon's rebel buddies get taken down by the Plaga-infested zombies, and their remaining leader Alexander uses a Plaga to launch a Licker attack on the capitol. Svetlana's forces are unable to repel them, until she unleashes several of the giant Tyrant monsters on them. Leon and Alexander are ultimately saved by the combined American and Russian forces, which almost seems to make everything Leon went through entirely pointless if they were going to step in and take control of the country in the first place.<br /><br />Damnation is a definate upgrade from Degeneration in as far as the action and animation, plus this one is actually Rated R so there's alot more blood for your buck. Storywise though, this doesn't have much of an impact on the given series, sorta like an anime movie based on an TV series like Naruto that acts an an outside filler arc. There's still very few actual \\"zombies\\" in this, although the showdown between the Tyrants and Lickers is a seriously cool fight. I'd recommend this for fans of the video games, or people who are just damn tired of Milla Jovovich and her Matrix bullcrap.or fans of the video games, or people who are just damn tired of Milla Jovovich and her Matrix bullcrap.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|These people are so talented, I love that the character seem like they are stereotypes but then something will happen and you'll be shown a whole different side of them. The musical numbers are great and Chris Colfer is so good in his role as Kurt Hummell he deserves more than the Golden Globe he already won.
B005FUTC86|5.0|The grand children love this movie!  We had been checking it out from the local library, but all were sad when we had to return it.  SOLUTION: Purchase a copy to be available any time!
B004WR125O|5.0|Plugged in to a new Onkyo TX-NR414 receiver, the little \\"Dongle\\" works perfectly.  It found and connected easily to my home router and in no time the receiver was connected wireless to the internet.  It opens up a whole new world of music and entertainment to hear through my sound system with a few button pushes.  I'm spoiled now and sure would hate to give it up! BTW, Amazon had the best price.
B007SGM084|5.0|loved the books, I read all three within a three week span. Looking forward to reading them again in the near future.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Love this new album, especially Mike Shinoda and his words, but all the songs on this album were outa sight and continues with the great music of Linkin Park
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Although I was squeamish about the taboo nature of the story, I quickly overcame my reservations.  These two characters were in love from the day the younger one was born.  The love affair is apparent when the characters were five and 10 (ish).  Even the mother sees it.  The father recgnizes it.  The stepfather is aware of it.  When adults, and just after the death of their mother, the two brothers explosively unite in what is one of the most beautifully acted love scenes ever recorded on film.  The actors are so believable in their love for each other--in and out of bed--that it is impossible for me to say anything remotely negative about their performances.  The movie is a visual treat.  These ridiculosly handsome guys, and the beautiful home where the characters grew up in affluence, are magnificently filmed.  Am I gushing too much?  Not a chance.
0525952926|5.0|I recently re-read the first book in this series, so it is fresh in my mind.  The flow and feel of the second book is nearly identical to the first book which was great.  Several reviewers have complained about the book having too many characters and I don't get that.  There are slightly more main characters than the first book, but not a huge difference.  This series has scope, and that can only be done through a lot of eyes.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|Well it is not a country album at all.  I enjoy many of the songs but not as much as her previous music. I think this album may leave her original country fans a little disappointed.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|The plot is good but had to start skip the sex scenes as it is just too many of them, which gets a bit boring!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it.It was so fun it was.probably one of my favorite games.It's kind of hard but it is still really fun.The only part I hate is that it takes time to get more coins.
B009QW7HMC|3.0|It is not bad it could be much better very disappointing when i thought we all were finally done with Lori they screwed us
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Loved the historical novel and got to know the well developed characters. I was sorry it ended and can't wait for the third book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun for all ages. I can do the more difficult levels and my 4 yr old granddaughter can do the easier ones, it is good learning for her too.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book; not many books can keep me wondering what will happen next?  I would go through my days wondering when I could get to read some more and wondering what will happen next.  I liked the format the author used, jumping between present day and the past.  She did a good job of helping the reader identify with the main character as she was in the present and how she was in the past.  This was a page-turner I couldn't put down and I wish I had something else by this author to pick up as while it was gratifying to gain closure at the end of the book, like always with any good book, it's such a let down when it's over.  This is a really, really good read and I can't wait to read her next book.  I hope it's another psychological thriller as this one was top-notch!  It's especially good if you really like British life; the author is a Brit and former investigator or something with the British police.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I didn't take watching this movie very serious and didn't expect much, but it did deliver a lot of fun and entertainment. Cruise was great, the songs are memorable and done well. The story is so so, it was worth watching just to see the actors pull of the roles they had taken on so well.
0765324857|5.0|If you're a HUGE fan of the game like I am, this is a MUST have.  If you couldn't get enough of the games and have played them multiple times, you shouldn't think twice about this book.  At 430 pages, it's actually a quick read as there are times you can't put it down.  Book does a good job at fleshing out certain minor characters from the game and gives them plenty of depth.  There are a few things that feel unnecessary in the reading and exist ONLY because they were in the game and the author wants to nudge us and say \\"Hey remember that?\\"<br /><br />Those are minor complaints.  Awesome book, great read, makes me want to play through again.  Can't wait for the new game in February!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great read! Keeps your attention! I never wanted to put the book down. Brought tears to my eyes, but also kept me wondering.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|First of all, I must say that I am not much of a reader. It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to literature. I bought this book because it was in the top 25, and it was the best decision I‘ve made to this day.   Everyone knows these characters because they are the people we love and the people we love to dislike.  Sam and Patrick are your closest friends from high school, Bill is your favorite teacher, and Susan is the girl who makes the biggest physical transformation between middle school and high school. Whether we acknowledge it or not, this is our high school experience. All of our thoughts and true actions are recorded in Charlie‘s letters. I would, however, hesitate to allow children or younger teenagers read this book due to occasional swearing, drug reference, and sexual content. Overall, this book captured my deepest thoughts and struggles and gave new perspective on them.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so addicted to this show now.  The first season was free with my Amazon Prime membership and just paid 14.99 for season two.  Watched it on my Kindle Fire.  First time I have used it for that, and other than the wireless connection at my gym being poor on a few occasions, it was perfect!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|So loved this book.  It shows a truth that can not be truly experienced by the mind.  My book \\"The Ordinary Buddha\\" is 13 stories of individual's awakenings while living on this earth.  I love that near-death-experiences really, while there are differences, still show us the same understandings as on-the-earth spiritual awakening experiences.

However, it is more than that.<br /><br />The beginning took me back to my childhood and how my grandfather was a major influence in my upbringing and who I am today. Only until he died, did I learn the untold stories of his life... just like Jake. However, at this point, the world changes to magic.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I absolutly LOVE this game. In Cut the Rope, Om Nom (the green monster) can only eat candy. Zepto Lab has created a top notch brain puzzle game where you have to figure out the puzzle, and get the candy to Om Nom. This game will have you laughing every time you play. The noises, and graphics are just too cute. This game is totally worth the $0.99 payment. Enjoy!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game, it is very addictive.  However I have noticed one issue.  Whenever one of the larger silver coins drop it give you a +2 or +3 that is added to your amount of coins that you have.  If more than one drops it doesn't add them all up it only gives you the total for one coin.  Kind of discouraging since the higher you level up the more there are and the heavier they are to move.  Lots of coins are lost moving them so I'd like to see an accurate count in my personal coins.<br /><br />Otherwise I love the game.<br /><br />Michelle R. Bard
1439152802|4.0|This spectacular new novel is just an astonishing achievement from the highly acclaimed author Kate Morton, who wrote the house at Riverton, the forgotten garden and the distant hours. This enthralling and truly compelling novel is such a great read, being one that is as good if not better than her previous works and is great confirmation of her skill and writing ability. I was moved by this poignant and emotive tale of wartime secrets, love and loss and above all family loyalty. There is something in this narrative that makes it so special as you really connect with the characters in the book, their stories and the hardships that they have to face. It is about desire and longing, divided loyalties and honesty that is projected through the characters decisions and choices, actions and feelings that are expressed so fully through the writing. Kate Morton brings wartime life to the forefront, making it as realistic and authentic of the time as possible with much understanding when it comes to researching the past. The characters within this tale are so believable because the author has painted such a vivid, clear picture of their lives and the foundations of this era.<br />Set in 1961 The Secret Keeper begins with Laurel daydreaming about a boy called Billy, her move to London and of what her uncertain future may bring. During this particularly hot summer's day Laurel is a witness to a most shocking crime that changes everything, and which becomes the catalyst for great change in her life and for the future. Time jumping to the modern day of 2011 Laurel, now a much loved actress, finds that her mysterious past filled with dark secrets comes back to haunt her as memories of that particular day and event come flooding back. Making the decision to return to her family home she then begins to piece together bits of the puzzle and the history of what once was. This tale of three very contrasting strangers (Dorothy, Vivien and Jimmy) who are brought together by chance in wartime London, are connected as their lives begin to entwine with each others both fiercely and fatefully. Shifting between 1930, the 1960's and the present day this is a story of mystery and hidden secrets to be unraveled, theatre and thievery, murder and enduring love.<br /><br />Set over three time periods this novel is both deeply complex, fascinating and intensity gripping and which will have you hooked to the page for hours. I completely lost myself within Lauren's (the eldest daughter of Dorothy Nicholson) story and the secrets that continued to reveal themselves after every single page, that began to piece together parts of the most inspired, clever and intriguing puzzle I have ever read within great literature. Kate Morton paints a very indisputable picture of the blitz that is earnest, whilst presenting you with a tale that is so spellbinding and which makes for a brilliant read. I loved every single part of this novel from beginning to end and therefore I cannot recommend it highly enough, to all readers who love historical fiction, heartfelt and honest narrative that is a delight to read. I am very much looking forward to reading more of Kate Morton's work as she has really impressed me with this wonderful book, and so I will not hesitate in adding other titles of hers to my bookshelves.rtime London, are connected as their lives begin to entwine with each others both fiercely and fatefully.

B004EFN6K8|2.0|A big deception, the content of this video is basically the same from earlier versions.  Not recommended.  She has so many CDs with so many great songs, is about time she includes new songs at her concerts.
B009KUANWG|5.0|I am a big Adele fan, and this track does not disappoint. Great song for a bond film. Her voice is perfect for this.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I finished this book in ONE DAY!!!  It was hard to put down...it was such a fun read!!!  I TOTALLY recommend it!!!<br />Tina Fey is smart and witty and cracks me up.  Parts of this book just made me bust out laughing!!!  It was great!!!<br />Bossypants basically went over her life journey from her childhood, her career, to right before the birth of her second daughter...nothing heavy, just enjoyable.  I hope that she considers doing another, because I know I wouldn't be disappointed!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very fun and addicting game. This is my new favorite game. I honestly didn't think I would like it as much as I do. And you can't beat free. worth getting if you like challenging game.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|when i thought dish would never get AMC back i downloaded the new season from Amazon. ready to watch on new kindle hd
B00992CF6W|1.0|This is.way to high of a price lower it Kr I won't buy it and I will tell my friends and family not to ether.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|This is a great mix of songs from Taylor and it shows her range from country to pop.  Because I love all types of music, this one fits right in with everything I own.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Nice to find a challenging game that isn't luck based!  I love that I can play it and so can my kids...with a little help
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I loved this game it was really fun and I had around 100000 coins and I was going to buy zombie Jake. I had to do something so I stopped playing and closed the app. when I came back it restarted itself and I lost all my coins. uninstalled immediatly.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have read all of the books involving Percy Jackson by Rick Riordan, and this one was just as good as the rest. I would highly recommend it if you have enjoyed any of the other books.
145162445X|4.0|The first 2/3 of this already short book are given to an overview of more or less recent developments in physics and cosmology, in preparation for the final 1/3, where at last the subject of the book's title is addressed. When the main arguments of the book do arrive, they turn out to be based on somewhat preliminary and speculative physics- very interesting, but nowhere near satisfying or convincing as an explanation of 'how something could arise from nothing.' Also, the author promises to show how the universe(s) could come into existence without 'preexisting' physical laws- his nothing ne plus ultra- but fails to actually do so. Honestly I would have been quite surprised and impressed if he had; but it illustrates the most frustrating aspect of the book, which is that it purports to sketch out a framework to obviate all manner of prime mover / first cause arguments, but fails pretty resoundingly to do so.<br /><br />Still, thought provoking and well worth reading.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Absolutely LOVE Lindsey Sterling's  CD.  Beautiful music that makes me want to dance and lifts up my heart.  Bought it after seeing her on TV. Best impulse purchase I've made in a long time.
1603425381|5.0|I'm so happy with this purchase! I'm an intermediate crocheter and was looking for more borders for flannel receiving blankets. I've been super disappointed with what's out there. I love that this book is in color; the photograph of each border is large enough that you can really see detail and the instructions are very clear. In addition, the ideas for combining colors really opened my eyes to new possibilities.<br /><br />One of my favorite features is that the author gives you the number your base row needs to be divisible by for the pattern to work. I'm not actually working with a hard corner but a rounded one and just ignored the corner instructions but it's nice to know they'll be there when I need them.<br /><br />The book itself is an odd size (8.5\\" by 6\\") but it is easy to prop open or put in a book stand close by because it's made of such heavy stock. I actually photocopied the one I was working with for ease of transport and use.<br /><br />I don't think I'll need to look elsewhere for edgings for a very long time.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I had J.K. Rowling sharing a pedestal with only deceased authors...until this abysmal book.  I didn't find one character to be likeable and felt like the narrative rambled on and on.  I kept wondering when the book would 'get good'.  It didn't.  I'm very sorry for Ms. Rowling that she didn't stop her literary career with HP.  Alas, don't struggle through wondering if there is something good here.  There is not!
0425263908|1.0|Bared to you is a Best Seller. It is written much better than Fifty Shades of Grey.  There was a great amount of sex, so I would not recommend this for your teen or the christian adult reader.  The story is interesting when to damaged people find each other.  There is not the bondage as in the Fifty books. However these two adults have many problems and even though they find each other marriage is not discussed.  The end leaves you hanging thinking there will be the proposal or a least more to the story with a proposal.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|If you enjoy historical novels, you will find this book gives an accurate reference as to what happened before, during, and after World War II.  Because the Cast of Characters is so long, it is a good idea to list everyone for a quick reference list.  I am reading this on my Kindle.  Therefore, a list on paper is a good supplement.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|My daughter enjoys this game very much. She and her dad have enjoyed playing it together and talking about what they have to do to keep customers happy.
B007TBZ63Y|2.0|I love the way he talked more about Percy than Jason! Its also amazing that ANNABETH and  Percy get together
B004X4QW42|5.0|For those of you who enjoyed Ip Man, Ip Man 2 is more of the same. It has excellent choreography, a gripping story, and very likable characters.<br />In Ip Man one, Ip was a badass. In Ip man 2, nothing has changed.
B005HI4LMS|4.0|Tucker and Dale vs. Evil (Eli Craig, 2010)<br /><br />Back in the day (in the dark ages of 1997) there was a ridiculously awesome TV series called Breaker High that pretty much no one watched. Among its cast of up-and-coming young-and-beautifuls were a pair of young actors who portrayed best pals Sean and Jimmy: Ryan Gosling and Tyler Labine. Three years later, Labine would be making high-profile Hollywood blockbusters like Antitrust, while Gosling had gone into the quirky-indie market with movies like The Believer. Fast-forward ten years... and somehow the roles have been reversed, with Gosling headlining everything from romantic melodramas (I man, crap, he was in a Nicholas Sparks movie ferfooxache) to neo-noir (Drive), while Labine, who's just as talented an actor, is now doing the indie thing. Ryan Gosling is in your face; you have to go looking for Tyler Labine. And here's the best example in recent memory of why you really, really want to.<br /><br />Tucker (Beautiful Boy`s Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Labine) are two blue-collar guys who are going on vacation for the first time in, well, ever; Tyler scored a great deal on a vacation property in the woods. Or so he thinks: it's actually the former residence of a crazed serial killer, and it's still replete with traps, tricks, and all other sorts of deadly hijinks. Still, the boys are determined to make the best of it, despite a bummer of a chance encounter with some college preppies at a dilapidated roadside gas station (a hilarious homage to at least fifty slasher flicks that have been released since The Texas Chain Saw Massacre). All goes well enough, with the boys managing to avoid getting themselves killed, until they run into the same college kids again while having a moonlight boat trip. One of the preppies, Allison (Piranha 3DDbeauty Katrina Bowden), slips from a rock and hits her head, so the boys bundle her into the boat and take her back to the cabin for medical attention, leading her friends to believe a couple of crazed serial killers have abducted their friend and launch a half-baked attempt to rescue her...with predictable results. From there, the comedy of errors gets funnier, and gorier, as the preps and assorted helpers from local law enforcement keep trying to rescue Allison--who's actually having quite a nice time bonding with Dale and playing board games--and running into the former occupant's traps or stumbling, sometimes quite literally, into fatal predicaments.<br /><br />There's not much I can say about this other than that it succeeds on all counts, and it does so in the most smashing of ways. It's not only the funniest horror comedy I've seen since the eighties (yes, funnier than Dance of the Dead, Boy Eats Girl, and even Slither), it's the funniest comedy of any stripe I've seen since The Fisher King and Delicatessen back in the early nineties. Wonderful. ****ouple of crazed serial killers have abducted their friend and launch a half-baked attempt to rescue her...with predictable results.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|My mom told me about Dr. Alexander and I was intrigued. I read this book in less than two hours. I could not go to sleep until I finished it. I was raised believing in God and I realize that not everbody feels the same way that I do. After reading this I don't see how anybody can deny the presence of a higher power. This is written by a docter who did not believe in God. This man being alive is a miracle. Please read this if you are having any doubts are if you need some reassurance.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have been playing the game over one year, and still love it. Some levels are very challenging. It is fun to too squish pigs and make full use of your chicken arsenal.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is wordy....no doubt about that.  Sometimes her characters seem full of big complexes, but it does intrigue one!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game but some of them are hard to beat. But its a very good addictive game to play.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I have to say that I too, along with my three girls, got totally engrossed in this movie. I thought it was a charming movie with good messages. What can I say, we are Tink lovers!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i very much enjoyed this book from beginning To end ...I loved the ending contrary to a vast amount of ppl ...I can see how it could've ended a different way but this ending was perfect to me ...I wish there was another book coming !
B006LSZECO|4.0|I bought this item at Amazon for my Kindle and I loved the book UNTIL I got to the ending.  It is very suspenseful and keeps you turning the page UNTIL the end.  I could think of a MUCH better ending.
B008VBYN80|5.0|finally someone got it right. been waiting a long time for a free game that has all the same aspects as a bought game. I think it rocks.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I'm very upset about these \\"restrictions\\". I mean I was able to download the kindle app on my laptop but I cannot download it to my tablet because of my geographical position...not bad, available in Canada for PCs but not tablets? I'm thinking about removing the amazon market app from my tablet because everytime I try to download an app, it's never available in my country. This is stupid!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is amazing but very challenging that's why I like this game I don't like it I love it
B003Y5H5F6|2.0|I'm pretty sure die-hard underworld fans such as myself, were disappointed with this installment to the series. While Beckinsale and Speedman did revive their roles as Selene and Michael, nothing else mattered but the plot. Wow what a complete waste of one hour and thirty minutes. In fact this movie was so bad I'm trading it in for a gift card! SPOILERS TO FOLLOW. We find out Vampires and Lycans have been all but terminated by humans and Selene is captured and frozen. Selene is freed by another prisoner and we learn that the girl is her daughter. Selene protects girl and finds another vampire coven. They are taken their but lycans are called in and apparently these lycans are immune to silver and are larger than previous lycans. Can we say genetic altering has taken place?? This said company is run by lycans who created this girl who can transform into a lycan and has vampire healing. Selene kills company owner and while we are lead to believe Michael is dead, it isn't true. At the very end where Selene finds him frozen as well. Selene kills company president, together with her daughter they find Michael has broken out of the lab and is gone off into the city. The two of them are left on top of a helicopter pad and must go looking for him. The end of the movie leave us with a cliffhanger for a sequel to this movie. I'm still sticking with Underworld and Underworld Evolution. Do yourself a favor and watch those again and skip this one completely. Screengems, please don't release another cruddy Underworld Movie like this.
0743270754|5.0|I often find reading history books very tedious. Team of Rivals was a welcome change. Goodwin writes as if she is sitting next to each character and making notes. Her research is so well woven into her own commentary that I felt like I was talking to a friend who had access to some incredibly powerful and influential people. As large a tome as this is, the pages almost turned themselves. A fun, enriching read.

B002APU580|5.0|I am a fan of Jane Austin's books, Pride and Prejudice being one of my favorites. This movie followed the story very well and maintained a great Jane Austin feeling.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I just finished reading The Bone Bed. It was a huge disappointment.  The story line was shallow with several sub plots about Lucy and Marino and of course Benton. I was really looking forward to reading this; but it was a huge letdown.  I'm not sure if I will read another Kay Scarpetta novel and that saddens me.  I had enjoyed her books until Benton rose from the dead.  I felt that was never really clearly explained and in each of the subsequent books, it just hangs out there waiting for a plausible explanation.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I finally got to play this after hearing so much about it. I love this app and it was free!

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I don't know why people not giving this app five stars.  Free movies to watch without needing online access.  Even my Hauwei Metro low end device has no problem downloading.  People are asking too much in this day and age.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|i loved this game but the 15 second ads that popped up EVERY 5-10 minutes was out of control!! what a shame because I was really enjoying myself
B009329ZF2|5.0|Battleship is a movie about the beginnings of an alien invasion. I like that the aliens are not outright brutal as so many are portrayed. The storyline flows quickly with great action. The drama portrayed by the actors is excellent. And the moments of humor are spot on.
B007HJ8RTI|5.0|I was a little worried after hearing from my friends that the HBO show didn't compare to the book, but I disagreed.  For the time alloted, I was amazed at how much of the story they were able to squeeze out.  Hopefully, Martin won't wait until the show catches up to the book to releaase book #6.  That being said, if you're reading this review(and you're a regular reader), forget about the show and go read the books.  Then enjoy the show.
0525952926|5.0|Even tho this book is a continuation of Follett's first book in the trilogy, it stands alone as an exciting, interesting novel.  I can't wait to read the third in the series!
B008K5T5AI|5.0|As ever with Iain (M) Banks the depth of character and cultural detail keep you engaged and enthralled throughout. The Culture series are pretty much my all time favorites, competing only with the original Dune series and the LOTR's.<br />I buy everything Mr Banks puts out on both sides of his repertoire for the simple reason that he is an amazing writer.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|SO.... A lot of people are writing their reviews based on what they thought about the movie and how they didn't get it. A GOOD MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU THINK AND QUESTION THINGS!!!!!!!!!!! Albeit, there's no way you can get everything that Ridley Scott intended for you to get from one viewing. That said, it's a great movie that's extremely well made.<br /><br />As for the product... It's a fantastic set. Great behind-the-scenes mini-docs! Everything from production information to little, well made, supplements to the plot of the movie like Weyland's TED talk and a \\"commercial\\" for David. The extended and deleted are excellent! This is an absolute must for anyone who liked the movie and wants to learn more about the Prometheus Universe.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, rent it first. This product is only for people who liked the movie and want to learn more about the lexicon of Prometheus, and will appreciate the effort that went into making this movie
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Please be prepared to buy 50 shades Freed also. Because in this trilogy you HAVE to have them all! I would love for a couple more books to continue in this series! Totally ADDICTING!!!!

B008O9V4C2|3.0|Well, you knew exactly what you'd get with this album.  It's extremely pleasant, inoffensive, and ready-made for the grocery store.  It's not hard to imagine yourself grooving out to Miss Marlene whilst perusing the Sanka, deciding on Geritol vs Centrum Silver, Polident vs Sea-Bond.<br /><br />Several years ago I found myself at the local shopping mall on an early Sunday evening, hoping an ice cream place I liked was still open.  But the mall had closed maybe an hour previously and it was deserted, though you could still walk around.  On the PA system I heard this oh-so-pleasant background music that sounded like Donald Fagen.  I wondered, does he have a new album out?  I was able to discern one lyric: \\"We'll have to work, my love, just to keep the flame from going out.\\"  I remembered the line, went home, and googled it.  Sure enough, it was from his 2006 album Morph the Cat -- which I bought when it came out.<br /><br />It was a moment of \\"oh.\\"  Yeah.  Here was this song I liked from the mall, hoping it was something new, only to realize that I already owned it, but didn't know it.  I guess the point is that Fagen's music is just not all that memorable.  His sound has not changed *at all* since at least 2000, and really not much since the few late-80s one-off tracks he recorded.<br /><br />I do like \\"Weather in My Head.\\"  It's a decent track.  But the recurring nightmare of lite harmonica that has plagued his recordings of late is just so dull and bad.<br /><br />I don't know.  Buy it or don't.  Your life won't change either way.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I ordered the kindle edition, which was very convenient for me: I could take it with me and read in the waiting rooms of various doctors and dentists. The plot was so intriguing that I actually could not wait to continue reading. Anyone who has not read one of the books in this trilogy is missing an exciting read.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|The app itself is great but the one amazon offers does not Work. had to go to goodle play to get the functioning one. Amazon needs to remove this from their products if they know it doesn not work and I've learned that they are aware of it...

B0053O89Z6|4.0|This clever sitcom still entertains me and my family in its seventh season. The characters remain true to their original creation, but have grown and developed. This is a great ensemble cast, with NPH as a solid contributor.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|its great and i extremely enjoy it and a lot of my friends are addicted to this game and i t gets more challenging everytime i play it!
0345803485|3.0|I picked this one up because everyone was talking about it.  I read all of the reviews and they were all over the place. I started this book thinking it was going to be an easy read, but it took me 3 months to read it.  It just wasn't that interesting and didn't hold my attention.  The good part was that you could return to this book over and over and over again and still be in the same place.  A lot of repetition and a very slow drawn out story line.  I bought the three-book set, so I am going to read them all.  Already started book two and its a little bit of a faster read than book one.  In addition, within the first five chapters of book two, there is some interesting developments.  I hope that book two doesn't fizzle out.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is amazing. When I saw it was finally available for my Kindle I didn't hesitate a second to buy it. Not only do I believe it is worth the price on the Kindle Fire, I've already paid for this game on two other platforms in the past.  Amazing graphics, addicting and challenging (but not unplayable) gameplay, a ton of levels (I believe 48?) and the rare quality of being great to play over and over again.  Of all the cell phone and tablet games out there, I would absolutely recommend this one the highest. Enjoy!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Love it. I highly recommend this book for several reasons. It will allow you to understand the different types if love
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Whatever your view about suspense and possibly the state of wolf populations in our environment, you will find this a spell binding film extremely revealing. It is sensitive, suspenseful, terrifying and engrossing. If you care about wolves, this film will let you understand why they have a place in the human intrusion into their world. What a wonderful view of a controversial subject with beautiful realities.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|Finally I found the first Harry Hole book after I have read three other Harry books. Jo Nesbo keeps you guessing from beginning to end and makes it almost impossible to put the book down until you have finished it. Even though it isn't necessary to read the books in order it was great to finally start from the beginning and get Harry's back story. Now if only they would translate the second book!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used this keyboard since it was the free app of the day.  But when I got my new phone it wouldn't install from amazon to my RAZR Maxx.  But now it seems that they have fixed it. This is the best replacement keyboard that i have tried by far.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|Good story but a little wordy.  Corey takes the (smart ass) comments a little too far.  I found myself skipping some of the snide remarks.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|My nine year old daughter and I played this game together on my Kindle Fire. What a great time we had figuring things out together. The graphics, storyline, fun and challenging puzzles made it so hard to put down each night. We both looked forward to playing it and rushed around here so that we could have extra time at the end of the night. We were so bummed out when it finally came to an end. We can't wait for number two on this one. I'm hoping we're able to find another one even half as entertaining.
B00902AKK4|2.0|I missed playing this game when I switched from my iPhone to Android. I was so excited to get it and start playing. Unfortunately the game crashes on at least half of the levels. Once it crashed 3 times on the same level. Sometimes it crashes so hard I have to reboot my phone.<br /><br />AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II with ICS
B009QW7HMC|5.0|The episode provided the desirable amount of surprises and twists to keep the viewer involved. Although the main cast wasn't present, the new scenario added a another chapter to the story.
B007W7P5L8|4.0|This Kindle Fire cover is sturdy and comes in really fun colors. My only complaint is that I wish it had a strap to wear around your hand while you're reading like some of the other Marware covers do.It's a little awkward to hang on to -especially if you're reading on a sunway or bus.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|could not put the book down.  Loved the John Corey humor.  Love the wife also.  Hope DeMille writes a new book in a hurry.  I was very disapointed when I finished the book as I had no more to read
B001O3B2M2|5.0|I am a huge fan of Christina Aguilera. This album did not disappoint in any way. She showed the full range of her voice.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|For fans of Scarpetta, and I am one, this book attempts to be a 'normal' mystery for once unrelated to Scarpetta personally. No spoilers here, but I was disappointed with the quality of the mystery. Most actions are just talked about endlessly in cars and offices, and the clues are not satisfying. Early on Marino is shipped off as a suspect, and we don't get to watch him be the good cop he really is. The books are best when Marino and Scarpetta face off over a perplexing series of clues. This book had none of that.

B008WCP2PG|3.0|The title pretty much sums it all up - excellent dancing, if they did that the entire movie it would have been 5 starts. LOL However the 'story line' was pretty terrible.<br /><br />**just a side note, I did not buy this luckily I did redbox and only paid $1 to watch it thankfully and the 3 starts is just for the dancing - nothing else:)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|With Amazon's faotd, apps come and go. This one tends to keep me coming back. Maybe it's the smooth and interesting gameplay, maybe the frequent updates and new levels. I keep coming back to this one. Love it!

0385344333|4.0|I really don't get why so many people seem to be slamming this book. It's certainly not the best Reacher novel, but I don't think it's the worst and it's still better than 98% of the junk that passes for fiction these days. OK, the plot was a little slow and the fascination with \\"rain man\\"-like statistics was a little tedious (why would they know that?) but like all Lee Child books, I kinda skimmed over those parts and generally found it fairly engrossing. In the end, I finished it far too quickly and was sad when it was over.<br /><br />So quit harping on Lee Child - you should be encouraging him to crank out more, not bad mouthing what he's done. If you want to be mad at him, do it because he reportedly agreed to Tom Cruise playing Reacher in the movie. Tom Cruise would fit in Reacher's pocket. Ridiculous.

030759565X|5.0|The \\"frugal\\" side of me thinks, 'I can just Google for a good recipe online or check the Smitten Kitchen blog.  Do I really need yet another book to add to my cramped one-bedroom apartment, and will I really find new recipes in it that appeal?  Should I just wait to borrow it from the library?'<br /><br />I'm glad that I didn't hit that cancel button because I got it and WOW.  I have been waiting for a recipe book from Ms. Perelman and now I remember why.  Her photos are stunning, the recipes I flipped through I haven't seen before, and her quick wit and humor translate beautifully in print.  The blog, plus so much more in tangible form.<br /><br />Some might be quick to comment that this is just her blog in print format.  I would like to state that yes, there is some overlap, but not much from what I have seen.  Plus, if you're a blogger and are producing a print copy, there is some expectation that there *will* be overlap and the more popular or highly clicked recipe posts will make it into the book.  If you didn't, you'd hear it from your audience.  You really can't please everyone, but I for one haven't been this excited about a cookbook in a long time.  There are many recipes I haven't seen on her blog, (and I have been following her for at least 6 years now) AND I love that she includes Jacob in her stories and annotations of the recipes.  I find the inspiration to cook simple, healthy, and tasty meals for my little man.  I suspect that Jacob is her source of inspiration... AND if your son was as cute as that little future heart breaker, you'd be sure to put him in your cookbook.  ** I'd like to also add that this is not a family album.  What it is: A fantastic cookbook.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Spoiler Free Review!<br /><br />This is one of those read-surreptitiously-at-work, late-into-the-night, at-long-stop-lights, while-your-partner-is-talking, kind of books. You will get yourself sucked into a hole, one as deep and cavernous as the Silo, keeping you trapped until you finish and crawl back into reality, blinking away tears at the sudden light. Get ready for an awesome ride.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />A society of people living in an underground silo, their only view of the uninhabitable planet through cameras on the outside. Most residents live their lives out, working their jobs, getting married, hoping to be chosen in the lottery to be able to bear children, without ever upsetting the status quo. However, a unintentionally scavenged piece of knowledge that results in an  always-deadly \\"Cleaning\\" of the cameras outside, sets off a sequence of events that will end up affecting every person in the Silo.<br /><br />The Awesome:<br />Character development truly carries this series. Howey is skilled at making these people utterly real and relatable, so much that the pain they feel, you'll end up experiencing as well. I love, love, LOVE that we have a female main character that is not a killer sexpot, innocent sexpot, or psycho sexpot. Juliette is strong, intelligent, and principled, and engineer to the bone. There desperately needs to be more characters like Jules, to inspire the next generation of engineers and mechanically-inclined women.<br /><br />Setting is superb. Evocative enough that as the book progresses, you start to experience the silo on a sensory level, feeling the steps underneath your feet, the perpetually recycled air against your skin. However, it is done subtly, without making you slog through pages or even just paragraphs of description. It's seamlessly interwoven with plot, as it should be, adding depth to the story rather than distracting from it.<br /><br />Plot is driven, tightly woven, and does not disappoint. Even as you piece things together, you'll be almost frantic to discover what's going to happen, up to the very last chapter. Howey has no problem killing off a character he's made you care about, so keep tissues handy.<br /><br />The Not-So-Awesome:<br />It ends. :( It starts this insatiable hunger to know MORE, what HAPPENS, and then it has the temerity to go and END on us?! What the H! >:(
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have been waiting for the release of this book.  That wait was worth it- I was not disappointed.  I have enjoyed the author's other books but this one is my favorite.  Her character descriptions are wonderful.  I love the way the story weaves the past and present together to make great story.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|If you used to be a duranie, like I was, you'll love the book, because of the inside look. But even though I liked the look inside, I still think it missed a bit. I didn't get the just as much as I hoped for, and I think there was to many times John held back on things. I didn't expect  all the dirty laundry to be exposed, but everybody knows some things happend within Duran Duran, that is important to getting to know who John Taylor really is. Not the best biography I have read, but still a good book.
0062073567|4.0|For some years I have heard this novel contains one of the best twists in popular literature. The characterisation was just a little flat and, while the plot was pretty much bullet-proof, there were a couple odd non sequiturs in the text. So perhaps it is not the perfect novel, but it deserves the plaudits none the less. One could say that Christie employed a literary device, perhaps one that this reader was alert to, I even suspect I may once have seen the movie, but the end got me. Highly recommended and enjoyable crime classic.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|The well known way of writing a thriller, but with a lot of history as well, which makes this book one of the best Stephen King I've ever read - and I have read a lot. This book was one of the fastest I've read in a long time, cause when I first started, I just couldn't put it down. The most fantastic thing about Stephen King, is the way he captures you from the first page, and you stay right on the track with him, untill the last page, and even though it's a long book as usual, you always think it ends to soon.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|Having worked in that part of the Wod  I found the authors discussion and portrayals of Yemen were excellent<br />And the book was very good but having the same lead characters in book after book  takes a great deal of the mystery out As you know they will survive for the next book..<br />Consequently I've enjoyed his books with \\"one-off\\" lead characters much more than this one..
B001HDWKMA|4.0|I just love Ray LaMontagne - always have - but this album to me is his best. A Falling Through is sorrowful and longing and just a real beauty, it is my favorite on the album.

B0071FBARY|5.0|Having been an admirer of all of thier prevoius works I was excited about Scars & Stories.  Although it has a clearly different sound from their previous works, it is every bit as good!
1451695187|2.0|and I was hoping to be uplifted by it.<br /><br /> First, the importance of his book is that he is an expert on the brain, and that according to all he knew and knows, his brain was \\"unplugged\\" while he was in a coma for seven days. And the fact that he is one of the \\"medical\\" and \\"science\\" people who knows what he knows, yet had this experience which confirms the soul mind, should carry some weight with doubters in fields of medicine and science.<br /><br />As one who has had several similar spiritual experiences, I felt very disappointed in one  thing he \\"got\\". I don't think it is likely that criminals and serial wrong-doers will be reading this book, but it really upset me that he wrote at least 3 times that one of the messages he got was that \\"nothing we do is wrong.\\" He did not , he states, go through a \\"life-review\\" like many near-death experiencers. People who have had that experience, feel very strongly that loving, and trying not to hurt others is very important. And I agree with that. And I just do not feel that \\"nothing we do is wrong\\" is really spiritually \\"correct\\". I feel like he did not have a very complete experience.<br /><br />I felt sick at the beginning of the book, reading about his contortions, and \\"pus.\\" He is a doctor, so that stuff doesn't bother him. It bothered me, that he focused on so much/MUCH medical observation, and of he schedule that his relatives kept going to see him.<br /><br />To conclude, I think that the \\"importance\\" of his book is for those doctors and scientists who have not believed in such experiences. The author is probably a nice guy, and I feel he is correct, as he wrote near the beginning somewhere, that our purpose is \\"to grow\\" here. It isn't his fault that his experience was not as wide-ranging as that of many others, but I felt frustrated especially with that \\"nothing we do is wrong\\" message. Most NDE-ers would , I think, not echo that idea, but instead, urge others to be sensitive, examine themselves, and certainlynot do whatever the heck they feel like. I wish this book had been written/marketed for medical and scientific people, rather than for the general public.
B005M2A4D4|3.0|I like Matt Smith as \\"The Doctor\\", but an overall summary of season six is thumbs down.  The episodes seemed bitty and only three or four of the eps were a continuation of the main story line. \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" was a true test of genuine love.  The Christmas ep was ridiculous.  Get the picture? ..........................scifigal....................

B008ALAHA4|4.0|This works as intended but none of the magnetic link is stronger than the other. This means that when you disconnect it, sometimes the adapter will stay with the laptop, sometimes, it will stay with the power supply.<br /><br />My solution, put some heat shrink around the adapter and the power supply side, de facto transforming a magsafe power supply into a magsafe2 power supply.<br /><br />Overall, this is just a so-so fix to a needlessly created problem of having two different kind of connectors (magsafe and magsafe2) which are not visually that different. Not different enough that you won't accidentally attempt to connect one kind to another.  Yet different enough to be incompatible, force you to update all your adapters and live an annoying transition as long as you have devices using both :-(
B002YCVX5S|3.0|Christoph Waltz makes this a great film. He is a joy to watch. A number of other actors do their part. Otherwise it's a silly movie. As usual for Tarantino, the violence is revolting and totally over-the-top. Brad Pitt's acting is horrible, again as usual. In short, it's a mixed bag.
B008ALA6DW|1.0|Unfortunately, this is the only way to connect something at high speed to a Retina MBP so I/we have to live with the below problems.<br /><br />First, the time to network is extremely long, about 20 seconds. When you enable airport, you usually have network connectivity within a few seconds. On a traditional MBP with an actual Ethernet plug, it's almost instantaneous. With this adapter, it takes 15-20 seconds!<br /><br />After a few weeks of uses and a dozen connection/disconnection cycle, the thunderbolt connector is quite loose and it doesn't take much for it to slide out and disconnect. This is especially annoying with the above mentioned issue as each disconnection yields to 20 seconds without network connectivity.
0545123275|4.0|Grace was in love with a wolf. Sam was in love with a human when he himself was not.<br />I enjoyed this book. It was cute and romantic and all of that other stuff that women like. It was a somewhat quick read and the writing was artistic and fun. There were a few slow parts but I suggest reading til the end-it was worth it and I loved the way it ended.<br />I wish that there was more character development though- I didn't feel like I knew Grace. Sam was a well developed character which is strange because I felt like we heard from Grace more.<br />The romance in this book was just enough without being way too much.<br />All in all I suggest this to those who enjoy a good paranormal romance. I can't wait to get my hands on Linger.

B001E1GXPA|5.0|When this CD came out, I was very hesitant to buy it. I had listened to Trivium's first three albums and, despite my fondness for progressive metal, was not particularly impressed; many of those songs sounded too rough (aesthetically under-polished) for my taste. But I read some pretty good reviews and figured I'd give it a try... and I was blown away. The progress and maturity that this band achieved in the mere two years since their previous release was astonishing. I enjoyed every single track on this album, especially Kirisute Gomen, Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis, and Shogun. The guitar work was much cleaner; the lyrics were more resonant, with deeper metaphors; and the vocals. Matt Heafy shines on every track of this album. His decision to use his screaming purposefully--as in Like Callisto, where the screamed vocals represent one character and the clean vocals another--sets the bar for the rest of the prog-metal community. And his baritone voice on the track Shogun is still the standard to which I hold many of my own vocals.<br />Now, four years later, this album is still my favorite of Trivium's LPs, and still one of my personal favorites. And if you don't already own them, the bonus tracks are worth purchasing.<br />I would recommend this CD, in particular, to fans of Metallica's Death Magnetic, Slipknot's Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses, System of A Down's Toxicity, and Dream Theater's A Dramatic Turn of Events. Enjoy.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found this book to have a ton of parallels to Twilight. If you like like the love story in Twilight you will probably like this book provided you're not offended by it. I find it easy  to skim or somehow ignore parts of books I don't like and I will say that this book often goes too fR INTO

B008BSPQ3E|5.0|I'll leave it to others to provide a comprehensive review of the content of this box.  My review will focus on the remastered audio of the original album.<br /><br />As presented on the physical CD included in this set, the So album has become yet another victim in the ongoing \\"loudness wars\\" plaguing contemporary music releases.  What would otherwise be a good remastering has been rendered loud, limited and compressed, more so than on any previous release of the album.  And if that was where the story ended, I'd recommend this box set only for its other content, but would urge you to look elsewhere for a better copy of the album itself. However, when purchasing this set, you are also provided with the option of downloading the master 24-bit/48-kHz files, from which the CD itself was mastered.  (They can also be purchased for download separately.)  The mastering presented in these files is outstanding, and quite possibly surpasses all previous versions of this album.<br /><br />For this remaster, Peter Gabriel wanted to go back to the original sonic \\"vision\\" of the `80s master, and worked directly with the original mastering engineer for the album, Ian Cooper.  The result of their efforts is a sound quite similar to the `80s CD, but with higher resolution, a touch more warmth, and slightly more muscularity.  (Also, there is a tiny boost in loudness, and a touch of added compression, but nothing that really detracts from the overall listening experience.)  These qualities are all reflected in the 24-bit master files, because these are the masters Gabriel and Cooper created, prior to any other tinkering for other formats.  In other words, these files present the album tracks as Gabriel and Cooper intended them to be heard, and they sound superb.<br /><br />In contrast, the CD is the sound of a record company commercializing those results.  When used for the physical CD, the master files were subjected to additional compression and limiting, thereby substantially increasing loudness, reducing dynamic range, and causing a significant amount of clipping.  Comparing the waveforms of the two versions shows the 24-bit files to be well within their maximum range, with plenty of punch and breathing room for transients.  Conversely, the CD waveforms show amplitude signals to be maxed out all over the place, with clearly \\"shaved\\" peaks that have nowhere to go.<br /><br />These numbers show the maximum and average volume levels for \\"In Your Eyes\\" from the original 1986 CD, the 2002 CD remaster, the 2003 SACD remaster, the 2012 CD remaster, and the 2012 master file (units are percentage of a CD's maximum gain; 24-bit file converted to redbook for analysis):<br /><br />1986: Peak = 99.90; Average = 46.00<br /><br />2002: Peak = 99.47; Average = 67.25<br /><br />2003: Peak = 50.99; Average = 31.68 (normalizes to 61.51% average at 99% peak volume)<br /><br />2012 CD: Peak = 100; Average = 75.33<br /><br />2012 master file: Peak = 99.06; Average = 55.50<br /><br />To be fair, the levels of compression used on the new CD are not as egregious as on so many new releases these days, and overall the CD remains listenable.  Nevertheless, it presents an unneeded and detrimental departure from the mastering on the 24-bit files.  With these master files, Gabriel has given us the definitive sound of one of his greatest albums, and their availability is commendable.  It's just too bad their sound isn't faithfully preserved on the physical product included in this set.asing loudness, reducing dynamic range, and causing a significant amount of clipping.

B0057UA486|5.0|Having never read the Thackery novel this movie was based on, I would still have to say the author would have been well pleased at the outcome.  I have no idea how much, if any, the novel differs from the film but the film is just beautiful, and the blu-ray is so much better than the standard issue dvd I bought years ago.  This is the way I remember it when it was in the theater in what? 1976?  It is so sharp and clear and there are no black bars top, bottom, or sides of the screen. I don't know about aspect ratios or any of that, but I have a widescreen tv and it fills the screen completely.<br /><br />I love the narration, and the lovely landscapes are indeed like paintings.  Terrific music.  I would highly recommend adding this to your collection.  I go back and forth between this and The Godfather for my favorite film, somedays it's one, somedays it's the other and somedays it's a tie.

B0096PAA6E|2.0|Ive seen Gary Clark Jr. Live, so I am aware of his immense talent, but this album does very little to capture it.<br /><br />Many of the tracks remind me of Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, almost too similar at times. There are a few solid tracks and guitar rifs on the album. The rest of it sounds like forced, over-produced tracks that were recycled from an R Kelly album.<br /><br />Gary you can do better!!

B007URVZJ6|4.0|When I set out to create my first e-book 2012 and Beyond (2012 AND BEYOND - The Present Time), I had no idea of how to go about it or what was involved! After searching the internet for information, I came across the \\"How to build your book for Kindle.\\" After reading through it I found the book to be very explanatory and is easy to understand even for those who are not computer geeks! The book lists in order the detailed steps necessary on how to create a word file including paragraph indent settings and formatting and how to convert the file for HTML. The upload and publishing process is also described in detail. It even gives hints on how to create a book cover using the right pixel settings of 1,000 x 625. How to set up the front matter such as title page and table of contents etc is also explained. Whilst the creating of the TOC is not described in great detail, it does not subtract from the book as the TOC will be created automatically when the steps described are followed. Although the book is set up for MS Office Word 2010, the process can even be used with Word 2003. Most of all, unlike other how to books, it is free to download. Before you even start to write it is best to read the book from the beginning to the end twice over.

Not only does a giant white bar cover much of the screen if you pause or slow the film (and this is a film that begs you to watch the FX frame by frame), a second bar appears above that one, a guarantee that you won't be able to see anything you want to see. Although they disappear after a few seconds, they reappear with every frame advance, virtually disabling your ability to study the FX. Compare this to the Harry Potter films, for example, where NOTHING appears on the screen when you pause it, which is exactly what a competent author does with a disk. Unfortunately, this one was authored by SLIME MOLD.

B008C20TDG|5.0|I purchased this book after hearing rave reviews from others who have read it (that I know personally). I attended Dallas & Melissa's workshop back in 2011 at a local gym. I've been following this type of diet for 2+ years and have done multiple Whole30 programs. I'm currently in the midst of another Whole30 and thought this might be a good refresher/motivation for me, but didn't expect to learn too much from the book, so I just purchased the Kindle version. After reading through the book, I'm now buying a hard copy as well - the basic food recipes are excellent (they give credit to Melissa who wrote the \\"Well Fed\\" cookbook, which I own as well) as well as the no-nonsense information about why certain foods can make us less healthy.<br /><br />Following this diet and with their advice, I now think of every food that I decide to eat and understand if it will make me more or less healthy. I think before I eat and I understand WHAT I'm eating. That is huge! For someone who grew up (literally) on fast food, my family is amazed to see me cooking fresh vegetables and eating stuff that doesn't come out of a box. I've seen a drastic improvement in my health and have dropped 30lbs that I didn't think I had to lose (this came slowly, but I've managed to keep the weight off for over 2 years). Through their program, I've also identified triggers that make me want to eat unhealthy things and I'm working to try to change that. I still struggle a bit with the social aspect of eating with people who don't understand why I eat the way that I do. I've repeated the information so many times that now I just rattle off a few of my favorite sources (this book will now be at the top of my list!) and tell them to go do their own research. I'm not going to engage people in a verbal argument about my food choices. If they can't see the difference in me (if they've known me for a number of years), I'm not going to fight about it. Food can be a testy topic - just like politics or religion.<br/><br />In summary, I find Dallas & Melissa's advice to be sound and they try to teach you how to navigate through the food landscape on your own after you identify how different foods contribute to your health & well being. For this alone, the book is well worth the price. They give you no-nosense, simply and tasty recipes to get you started. This way of eating made me a better cook. I literally had to learn to cook, I had to learn what spices went with which food items and which spices I prefer. In the end, it's worth it. Even though we eat very high quality proteins, we can cook at home for less than it costs to eat out at a restaurant and the food quality is higher, plus it's tasty!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille again brought us John Corey in an exciting Mideast adventure.  I love his smart mouth and brains.  This book also provides some insight into the MidEast experience and customs.  I hope there is more to come.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Fun reading. Another one you can't put down. This one should have been the initial introduction to Jack Reacher because it sets the tone for all that follow.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love the game but need ways to connect to more friends.  Need to come back often otherwise.  Connecting with Facenook friends would help.
0446580848|3.0|You have to read at least 80% of this book before getting to any confrontations with the bad guys. No gun fights, fist fights or car chases that are worth their salt. This part of the book mainly consists of a myriad of one-liners by the main character, grousing about his assignment to Yemen. Some are funny but most are not, and they eventually become an annoyance by trying to force humor when none is called for. The last 20% of the book contains the meat of the plot, although here things become very complicated with double dealings and behind the scenes plans against the main characters. I was looking for an adventure/mystery story, but what I got was a joke book.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love the game but still trying to master it.  Just wish I could get passed Level 7 of Greece.<br />I need a tutorial...
B007THA4FI|1.0|When I began reading Casual Vacancy I knew would have to adjust my brain and not expect Harry Potteresque writing.  However, I was so disappointed in the book.  I hated it.  I tried valiantly to like it and I kept reading, but I finally gave up.  It was very disappointing.

B008OIQYTG|5.0|As on his last album, 6 string theory, Lee Ritenour is gathering top class studio artists and creates an extremely versatile CD. Anybody liking melodic, rhythmic jazz music with a lot of different facettes will have much longlasting fun. You feel the joy the musicians had when recording this album. You´ll find some interesting videos on youtube, showing the production of this recording.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Love, love, love Revenge!! I'm enjoying every minute of this show!!! I can't stop watching Revenge and stay up until all hours to watch each episode!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I adored this book. I read the reviews and apperciate folks doing that because it helped me make the choice of which book to start reading next. I finished this book in a day. Fell in love with the characters, and could not put it down. Do yourselve a favor~buy it. You will not regret it..I know I sure didn't. Hoping for a sequel..
B001CTDH4Y|4.0|This was the best of the three in the series.  This one was funny and had a story to it. Too many sequels sometimes ruin them.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|While I did find the content of the first book fun and exciting, now that I have read the third book it has become much of the same over and over. I do like that there more of story line and plot but found myself skimming several pages at a time because I was more interseted in the story line than yet another sex scene.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I only buy DVDs of films I really really like, this is the case for this film, if for some reason you haven't seen it, get it, you won't regret it!
B002NNA9N0|5.0|After working for a short period of time at TruGreen (training in two days) for inside sales, I learned first hand what it was like to work in a very demeaning and underpaid work environment.  When I shared information about what daily work environment was like with family and friends, I was told to watch the movie Glengarry Glen Ross...  I couldn't believe how many of the negative and illegal work practices from years ago were very real and present in work life at Tru-Green.  Sadly the management knew what was going on and did nothing.<br />Awful company to work at.. if you have any self worth or self esteem, don't go here. Salary is based on 50 hr work week, so you aren't paid the hourly wage told - and I was paid less than men doing the exact same job (they were paid higher commissions).  I was actually offered money for one of my sales by a male colleague because he was paid a higher commission and wanted my sale for higher commission bracket.  I said no.<br /><br />This movie is a chilling reminder of what I went through as a woman in an environment few can tolerate or remain in.
B0084ANCBC|4.0|It was long, but I liked it.  It made me appreciate how things have changed, but also how some things will never change.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This story is packed full of friendship issues and how to handle these situations<br />Super fun and a great read!
B00785P2QC|4.0|its free. hard to advance fast without buying coins etc. full length though. a lot of waiting like facebook game
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|I have always wanted to see an Opera in person.  This is the next best thing.  I have a big screen TV, and I can sit in the comfort of my own home and watch an Opera even with subtitles to translate the language.  I am very satisfied with the DVD and plan to purchase more.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I thought it was good; but not one of her best.  I have read almost all of her novels and love Kay Scarpetta.  I would like to see them make more movies with Angie Harmen
B0049UVAVU|1.0|Do not buy! This distribution company's name says it all. Shameless. They completely mutilate the coolest scene in the movie by removing the mutilation. I bought this to replace a dvd copy I used to have and that included the razor nipple scene in its entirety and was much cheaper. To think that this company tries to claim this \\"the most complete\\" version of New York Ripper available today is inconceivable to me. Maybe in the UK. Which is a place I just decided I will never set foot in. This is my favorite Fulci movie. Fulci is my favorite director. If I can't return this blu ray I'll take it out in the street and burn it. Then I'll puke on its melted remains.
B008CJ0KEM|4.0|If you like the Lost Girl program, you will enjoy this dvd, did not see much difference between SiFi and DVD except a little more skin (not much) save yourself the money. DVR it, when it shows on dish.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I'm not a book reader but I couldn't put this down. Loved it, can't wait for the next one. Already preordered
B006LSZECO|3.0|Throughout this book I was riveted!  I loved all the twists and turns.  Then, I get to the end.  HIGHLY disappointed in the way it ended!  I expected more after being on such a roller coaster ride all the way through the book.  I guess the one thing that the author did do right was to make you both love and hate the characters.  I would recommend this book but don't be waiting for a climactic ending, it won't happen.  I kept reading past the acknowledgements thinking there HAS to be more...but alas, I was let down.  This is my opinion.  Read it for yourself and see if you feel the same.
B008I43DYU|5.0|it is a very goog app for the Kindle. I recommend it. I do not regret what I pay for it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is one of Nelson DeMille's best books. A real page turner that I found hard to put down. John Corey, as usual is an amazing character.
B00914JWSW|1.0|This entire album doesn't cut the proverbial mustard.  It's a shame as I thought WOW this is going to be the younger Barbra singing which I love.  I quite liked \\"With One More Look\\" from A Star Is Born but other than this track it was a very poor offering.  I believe that it's time that this 'Star' retired.  I feel I've been taken for a ride with the last few albums.  Time to call it a day Barb' and leave us to enjoy what 'was' rather than what currently isn't and what will never be again.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|Playing backflip is the most fun ever, I laugh from the time I start til I turn the game off,I don't play the game well, but that doesn't matter ,I would recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh, my gdaughter is an award winning gymnast, and she loves backflip, be sure to have volume up, I love the noises the guy makes when he falls. Best game ever. Sandy
0345803485|5.0|Great product. Highly recommend it perfect for the job works great will buy more as gifts for my friends and family
1594203334|4.0|I really appreciated the insights this book offered on both American and French parenting. It made me question my own beliefs and gave me a new perspective on why those beliefs exist. Added bonus: It is an easy read. I wouldn't call it great literature, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars, but for those looking for something relatively light yet thought-provoking, I would highly recommend it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent movie very thought provoking looking forward to the second film. Very good acting and this was a gift so I really don't know
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I am not quite finished with this book yet, but it's def holding my interest. This is the third book I've read by Gillian Flynn and I've loved them all. I'm ready for another, as soon as she publishes another. Please write faster Gillian!
B001LF6VLK|5.0|I thought i already reviewed this movie. It was wonderful, sad. Happy, intriiuging, and more than you hope for. Sean Connery is superb as always,but Christopher Lambert is absolutely perfect in this roll. Of course i always hate the villain so without mentioning names we will leave it at that!<br />The romantic sides in this movie are very rewarding additions to it. Its very dreamy and i did find myself wanting to mentally go tjere again many times. Even now.<br />Thats all i have to say. If you want to know more, then buy the movie and get your popcorn ready and just enjoy it!  You want be sorry in my books!<br />I want to add that the sweet scenes with first love were memorable and the sexy intimate scenes with second love made me blush! Even in my dreams. But Queens contribution to the musical score was myfirst reasin to buy this movie. I was not dissapointed! Got many rewards! Try it. You will have a classic.
B007HU7NBK|2.0|I expected a lot more rock & roll raunchiness and insight about one of my all-time favorite bands...not to learn that John Taylor had crabs.  Yep.  He felt it necessary to document having crabs.  Overall,  this was not a very interesting read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book is an awesome read! The finality was unexpected, yet thoughtful.  It's a book that you can read over and over.  I am a fan for life.
0786956291|5.0|I've always wanted to play DnD and this has helped me learn a lot. Just started playing with a group and can't wait to dive into the immense world of role playing.<br />It was delivered really fast too.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and can not wait for the next installment! I fell in love with Vaelin almost immediately. He is smart, strong, and loyal. The story did not drag, but quickly drew you into the lives of each character. I would definitely recommend this book!
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|Well, I missed the ending because I rented the movie on my new Kindle HD. I love the movie though as it had a ton of 80's music in it which I love! The acting was really good and I loved seeing Tom Cruise in this role! I highly recommend renting it but not sure about in HD!
030759565X|5.0|I got my copy of the book yesterday, and I'm so happy to see some of my favorite recipes revisited.  Literally everything I've made off of the Smitten Kitchen website has been a hit, from the carrot miso soup that my daughter begs me to make, to the apple cheddar scones my family demands for holiday breakfasts.  While neither of those made it into the book, a new and improved butternut squash galette is going to be on my Thanksgiving menu again.  I've found no other recipe source has been so consistently great. Deb's recipes are easy to follow without requiring any guesswork, and I hardly ever make any on-the-fly changes.  That last bit is notable for me, because I am unable to leave most recipes alone.  The book captures everything the spirit of Smitten Kitchen so well.  I originally pre-ordered it as a way to support the work I've been enjoying for free for so long, but it's a valuable resource in its own right.  This will get a lot of use, and may end up being ordered as a present for several people this year.
B008R9QAY6|5.0|It´s finally here, Leonardo Vinci´s Artaserse, one of the most popular and influential operas of the 1730´s. Leonardo Vinci was a hugely talented composer from Calabria, and though his birthplace and date of birth are still in dispute, he must have been born around 1696.<br />Vinci studied in the celebrated Conservatory dei Poveri di Gesú Cristo in Naples, and began his career as an opera composer when he was in his early 20´s. I first heard of him thanks to the marvelous recording of his comic opera Li Zitte N´Galera with La Cappella de´Turchini in the OPUS111 label. Earlier this year Dynamic released on cd a live recording of La Partenope also with La Cappella de´Turchini, a marvelous opera whose libretto Handel later used for his own version of Partenope.<br />Now Virgin, and not a minute too soon, do him proud with a stellar recording of his last opera, Artaserse, to a libreto by Imperial Court Composer Pietro Metastasio. Artaserse became so popular and well liked that Charles de Brosses in Paris was referring to it as \\"the most celebrated Italian opera\\". It´s really great music, with character, fantasy and endless melodic invention. Virgin has assembled a showcase of great countertenors, no less than 5, including Max Emanuel Cencic and Philippe Jaroussky. But the big aria of the opera that ends Act 1 \\"Vo solcando un mar crudele\\" goes to Franco Fagioli, a spectacular Argentinian countertenor with a Marilyn Horne technique,<br />But all the singing is absolutely spectacular (needless to say), and conductor Diego Fasolis left his excellent Swiss group I Barocchisti at home in favor of the legendary Concerto Köln, one of the best period orchestras around.<br />This is an extremely important recording because it finally makes available a much talked about masterpiece from the Baroque Era, and not only that, but a very enjoyable one too.<br />Leonardo Vinci like his equally talented contemporary Domenec Terradellas was murdered in Rome when he was still very young. There were talks of a love affair with a high born Roman lady, Vinci was reputedly very handsome, or more likely a jealous rival composer poisoned him (Porpora could hardly bear to hear his name), the fact is that the World was robbed of a major composer who lost his life at age 34.<br />This is infinitely better singing than what the MET can offer in Wagner these days, yes, I´m talking of the new RING of course, and the Artaserse is an instant landmark recording. Do get it.
0316223239|4.0|\\"Room\\" will grab you and not let you go until the very last page.  Excellent reading and very thought provoking.  It begs the question of how many other ways humans can exist in closed, small societal environments and what are the consequences of such conditions...such as over-bearing parents or spouses, oppressive work environments, etc.  Our Book Club purchases all of its books from Amazon.com and the ease of this certainly adds to our enjoyment. Thank you, Amazon!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther is a very time-appropriate novel.  I learned a lot about the Middle East with a good story and plenty of humor. I've read all of DeMille's novels and this one is as good as any of them.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|You can almost hear this droll, intelligent, and genuine lady speaking to you as you read her work here.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable, light read that will also make the parents out there stop and think a little bit about the long tern effects of some of their own hang ups on their children.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I tried to download this to my Droid, Amazon took my money, but all I got was continuous error messages when trying to download/install.

Probably going to take me at least a week to learn everything it can do!

B007EECSFA|3.0|Very slow in the beginning of the book.  I wasn't sure if I even wanted to finish.  Narrative does not flow as Morton's other books did.  Last quarter of the book became interesting enough that I was glad I finished it.  Loved her other books.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|A hard to put down story! Easy read and easy to follow. Enjoyed it 100 percent. I would highly recommend it
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|Hollywood needs to take lessons on how to do movies or series like the Walking Dead. Horror films these days are not made like The Walking Dead is made when it comes to gore,special effects,etc. These guys do a great job of putting the Walking Dead series together. I would recommend watching The Walking Dead from the very first season.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|John Hiatt is the wizard of rock n roll.  He's the musician's songwriter, the rockabilly rockmaster who never fails to execute with songs that just get down to your ankle bones.  Buy Mystic Pinball; I dare you to be disappointed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|SSometimes a sequel can be very disappointing. It was not the case with this one. I actually found myself laughing out loud, embarrassed and disheartened for the characters as if I was actually there living the events. I was surprised by the way the story went but very excited to see what the third and final book will be like. There are many loose ends that I can't wait to see tied.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have read bible all my life. But this study bible makes it fun. The more I read the more I want to discover. The kindle version is inexpensive and very easy to use. I can't compare it with other study bibles but I am very happy with this one.

B0053O89KG|5.0|I loved the 4th season. Season five I know will be even better. I love the show. The characters are great and could not have been cast with greater acters. They all gel great together.
B005O7PSRO|4.0|I love Castle, the actual Castle character. I believe Kate is beautiful/hot, but I also feel it's painfully obvious she's trying to hard to be tough. They could've picked a better actress to play the tough hottie. However, I love this show, and impatiently wait for the next episode.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|Was trying to find a button for a photobooth project.  Found this product and the reviews where very good.  I not only use it for my photobooth but for editing pictures and video too.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />However, you can't go wrong with this one and even if you can't figure it out you can always return it to Amazon.  But I'm sure you will love it as much as I do.
B009WJWMNI|5.0|I never thought that a TV series would be made that would have such a believable character... the actors in this new show were well picked.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|From the very beginning, people like Michael Moore always attempt to redefine capitalism. Adam Smith already defined it hundreds of years ago. One of the pillars of that definition is the notion that people on both sides of a contract enter into it freely because they both believe they are getting something out of it. People like Michael Moore are all over the map on that one issue. On one hand, they really don't believe you're smart enough to make decisions for yourselves. On the other hand, they don't want business owners to be able to make their own decisions either. When they critique capitalism, they almost always criticize things that contain a heavy dosage of coercion, meaning the thing they are critiquing doesn't meet the most basic definition of capitalism.<br /><br />Michael Moore does not even really understand the thing he is attempting to criticize at the most basic level and it saddens me that people will view this movie without first understanding that when one side of a transaction is coerced, the transaction ceases to be capitalist in nature. For the sake of brevity, I will end my review there.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|While I basically like this book, I found that the &#34;world building&#34; (amount of detail provided) is a bit weak even considering that it's written in first-person voice from the point of view of someone who's largely kept in the dark by a totalitarian government. To me the setting basically seems too surrealistic for the level of believability that the author seems to be aiming for simply due to the lack of detail about the world itself. Obviously the whole premise of the book is far-fetched but in order to have characters who behave according to believable realistic human psychology you need enough detail about the environment to get the feeling that their behavior makes sense. I feel like there are too many unanswered questions and unspecified details to give me confidence that the author is making realistic statements about human behavior and society.<br /><br />For example, I'm constantly thinking to myself: &#34;There's absolutely no way they'd need to have a lottery to force someone to participate. They would always have volunteers, and if there was a lottery it would be to decide which volunteer actually got the option to become the 'tribute'. There are simply too many adolescents who are suicidal, or want some sort of fame and don't really grasp that they're over 95% likely to die, or maybe just want to die or would be willing to just to be famous for a while.&#34;<br /><br />Maybe I'm just hyperanalytical, or I just spend a lot more time than most people do studying how people behave in real world extreme situations, but while I think the author does understand certain aspects of human psychology very well as it applies to warfare, I still can't help but be bothered by too many behavioral assumptions that just don't seem to match up with real-world study and experiences.
0061733199|5.0|Listen Just buy this dont even think about it I have read A LOT of survival hand books over the past couple of years and this is one of the best.It covers just about everything there is, So just take the word of an Eagle Scout you will not regret purchasing this book.
1569242739|5.0|This is absolutely THE BEST cake/cupcake recipe cookbook EVER. I have made recipes from this book over and over again with nothing less than perfectly yummy, moist cupcakes every single time. My boyfriend is absolutely obsessed with the chocolate cupcakes and literally wines when I haven't made enough \\"extra\\" for him. I made both the chocolate and vanilla gluten free cupcakes for a friend's wedding, and they got rave reviews. I also added chocolate chips to the chocolate cupcake recipe for another friend's wedding, and guests were coming up to me all night saying how moist and delicious they were (and they didn't even know they were vegan!). I use the vanilla buttercream frosting recipe (although I only use about 1/2 the recommended amount of milk) on just about everything! It's easily adaptable for other flavors too, you just switch out the vanilla extract for whichever flavor you want. This is my go-to book for cake/cupcake recipes. Vegan or otherwise, these are the best cupcakes on the planet.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was on a high from the 50 Shades series and came across the first book in this series, Bared To You. I was still left wanting more and patiently awaited Reflected In You.  What a step up from the first novel. Now patiently awaiting the third book in this series.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|First off, I think the author might have a thing for Kelly Clarkson lyrics because she has a song called Beautiful Disaster and Walking Disaster (book from Travis' POV) is a lyric from a Kelly Clarkson song. I love KC so whatever :)<br /><br />I found myself really confused by this book. There was no real plot or story line, just that Abby didn't want to repeat her mistakes. Honestly, I didn't like Abby much. She couldn't make up her mind which drove me crazy the whole time. I did like Travis, although I thought he was little over the top. The characters weren't well developed and I was kind of shocked at some of the things that occurred between Travis' and Abby's friendship/relationship. I wish we knew more about Travis' past to find out what made him the way he was (but I guess we'll get that in WD).<br /><br />I didn't like the ending. It just left us hanging and I was wish there was more concise ending. It was a quick read but I don't think it's worth $7.99.
B006UKC566|5.0|Really enjoying the new 3D films (with a couple of exceptions).  This film was very enjoyable in 3D - decent story with really cool visuals.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book has so many similarites to 50 Shades of Grey that I wouldn't be surprised if they got accused of plagiarism.  I thoroughly enjoyed it anyway.  If you liked 50 Shades and can look past the similarities, then you will enjoy this book.
0375507256|4.0|CLOUD ATLAS (2004 Man Booker Prize Finalist) is complex fiction; David Mitchell joins (strings n weaves) six medium-length tales--each nearly sufficient unto itself and each passably resolved, together; notwithstanding the abrupt mid-sentence termination of Adam Ewing's journal entries at the outset (initial chapter) ah, intrigue in the offing (!) and despite how tenuously one character may suggest another--from a prior segment--Mitchell reintroduces them in a kind of second-half sequel, and so it all soon begins to work rather well.<br /><br />His characters (credible?--passably; likable?--two or three; where not--revelatory of gritty humanity) reflect each other across eras: 1850s, 1930s, 1970s, 1990s, and a science-fiction-era: Year 2144--in which cloning has led to an evolved yet enslaved sentient class) so it seems Mitchell is reincarnating his creations; also, there's this 'comet' tattoo of his that keeps popping up, tail n all (ooooh, so spooooky--nah, not really: the author neglects to drill this body-ink motif sufficiently to get it through my thick skull; never did say: \\"Ah, I get it!\\" As for Twilight Zone's theme wafting o're me whenever a story-connecting etude blew in, such woo-woos of his just did not resonate; but no matter, there's much to ponder:<br /><br />The characters' South Pacific, Belgian, China-cum-Korean and Hawaiian motifs kept my nose to the grindstone [page after page, small type] till I hit THE END. Why?--A COMPELLING QUALITY OF WRITING; each character, speaking in an era's dialect, did share (or came to share) a resigned cynicism (hey, there's little reason for optimism) yet also appear inclined to engage in and enhance life--no matter his or her limitations, or til life's tenebrous aspects overwhelm them, or that relentless killer shows up. CLOUD ATLAS is far more interesting than gloomy; it's just that life's deflating; did I mention mortal? Sad how oblivious Adam Ewing is to his own demise.<br /><br />A reader obstacle---for me, a nuisance---interpreting Mitchell's language style in `Sloosha's Crossin'--a 70-page segment that draws on Hawaiian folklore.<br /><br />[Warning: spoiler alert; the novel's line-up follows]<br /><br />  #1) Adam Ewing, notary---33-year old's journal entries in 1850s English are posted during a South Pacific three-masted sailing; Adam reports roguish behavior. (Hint: an avowed physician and a Christian missionary have much to answer for, but don't) Adam ends up owing his life to Autua, a freed slave, and becomes an abolitionist, determined to have a life worth living by helping to shape a world that he wants his son to inherit, and NOT one that he fears that his son will.<br /><br />  #2) Letters from Zedelghem: Musician/composer/amanuensis Robert Frobisher pursues an ex-pat Englander in failing health--a cantankerous composer: Vivyan Ayers; he stalks Ayers to a Belgian castle-hideaway on the outskirts of 1931 Bruges; Frobisher gains employment and lodging from the nearly-blind genius, and is seduced by Ayer's 50-ish wife, whose daughter Eva he ultimately lusts for (The Graduate? Nope. Things don't work out so well for Robert, as for Dustin); the talented young Englishman (Frobisher) seems compelled to unburden his woe-is-me rural existence in a series of letters to a mysterious `Sixsmith' -Frobisher's occasional benefactor, and, it comes to light, his once-upon-a-time lover. In the close, Frobisher has planned his suicide well; even so, he is doubtful that he will escape himself even in death; he believes \\"We do not stay dead long.\\" However, he employs the Luger, to see perhaps if his belief will stand up.<br /><br />  #3) Rufus Sixsmith unmasked:  in this 1970s noir segment he is 66 and an energy-consultant/nuclear scientist/whistle-blower in `Half-lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery.' Its atomic-powered rending has a Three-Mile Island flavor; Mitchell ushers in murder-for-hire, corporate malfeasance, p.r.-intrigue, investigative journalism---whisking in comeuppancesfor all dem kats in the his cat n mouse fray. At one point the reader is left hanging, like when Luisa gets launched over a bridge-railing into a sure-watery death by hit-man Bill Smoke. But heroine Luisa survives such repeated close-calls, exposes corporate wrongdoing, and Smoke gets smoked.<br /><br />  #4) The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish was by far my favorite of the six tales: the protagonist (poor buggah suffers a stroke in Aurora House) is a n'er-do-well publisher/book-agent, also 66; he gets trapped in an assisted-living facility; his farcical attempt to escape the wretched place (and the clutches of Nurse Noakes--One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest sprang to mind) is humorous as all get out, if only he can get out; Looking at old-age homes: \\"You will not apply for membership, but the tribe of the elderly will claim you...this slippage will stretch your skin, sag your skeleton, erode your hair and memory, make your skin turn opaque so your twitching organs and blue-cheese veins will be semivisible...only babies, cats, and drug addicts will acknowledge your existence... and you will stand before a mirror, and think, E.T. locked in a ruddy cupboard.\\"  More: \\"Oh, once you've been initiated into the Elderly, the world doesn't want you back.\\" For laughs, re-read pages 360-361.  There's also the not-so-funny: \\"Unlimited power in the hands of limited people always leads to cruelty\\"--consider the right-wing dominated U.S. House of Representatives. It does turn out well for Mr. Cavendish; he relocates to a northern England village, his ordeal and middle-age left behind.<br /><br />  #5) AN ORISON OF SONMI, 451 -deposition of a cloned (fabricated) human, conducted by an archivist; her name: Sonmi; her production #: 451--assigned off the wombtank assembly line: a `perfect organic machinery' in a futuristic Nea So Copros regime. Having snuck herself an education, and uncovering a murderous government conspiracy, she's a major threat to establishment enforcers. She's awaiting execution, sees herself a martyr, and tells the skeptical archivist about show trials, and over-population solutions. Sonmi thus gives evidence of a grim 22nd century world: which is life under Papa Song--he may be the equivalent of The Great and Powerful Oz--a sham tyrant, made in this instance of bytes n bits. Two groups at odds: 1) Unanimity, whose Purebloods hold n wield power in a suffocating, corpocratic state, and 2) Union Abolitionists, whose aim it is to wrest power from Unanimity, and put an end to fabricant slavery. The setting? Northeast China, near a Korean peninsula. Sonmi tells the archivist that highly-ascended Purebloods (think Cheney, Rove, Rumsfeld, or the Koch bros.) intend to exterminate downscale Purebloods (anyone at all literate) in order to replace them with docile, readily controllable clones (say, ones beholden to Grover Norquist.)<br /><br />#6) Sloosha's Crossin: Zachry--this tale's illiterate narrator--and Meronym, an island guest, traverse the Big Isle of Hawaii together. Meronym (back from the future) stops in at Kona, ostensibly to study Island Life and to document how Hilo natives placate (toss in a few slaves every so often) their awesome god Mauna Kea; either He is a humongous volcano or He inhabits it. Who the slaves are depends on who's exercising dominance. This segment was my least favorite, its vernacular hard to fathom. Mitchell's witticisms, however, are numerous: \\"The nation-state is merely human nature inflated to monstrous proportions. Another war is always coming. War is one of humanity's two eternal companions.\\"<br /><br />Wrote this review in Feb 2011. Then in Oct 2012 I saw CLOUD ATLAS, the movie---dumbstruck the film project would even be tackled. Anyone who has NOT read the book, it's my belief, will be lost in this film, and likely frustrated. For the book's readers, the movie will be entertaining. (Yet come to think of it, now that you've read my review, you may profit from the movie after all) I was particularly engaged in the film's ORISON OF SONMI 451 sci-fi segments. Jim Broadbent is terrific; Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are fine; the one casting miscue: Susan Sarandon.awaiting execution, sees herself a martyr, and tells the skeptical archivist about show trials, and over-population solutions.

030758836X|5.0|This book was a little slow to get into, but once your in, you can't put it down.  The characters are engaging and well-developed.  The plot is exciting and unpredictable. Enjoy!

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love this character, but I feel this was not the best Reacher , maybe Lee Child was thinking how dumb it was<br />to have Tom Cruise play a 6'4\\" Jack Reacher in Hollywoods version...Must be the $$$ they are paying him.
B003W5C0VM|4.0|The film is a mix of good and bad.  The Stones are great, at the top of their game, which more than makes up for the horrible directing.<br /><br />The film starts with a great extended lead up to the Stones coming on stage.  Your anticipation builds until you hear the announcer say, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen the Rolling Stones\\".  You hear the crowd roar and you feel your hair stand on end.  Suddenly a shot of Charlie on the drums.  Then Keith ambles out in his typical style, followed by Mick Jagger bounding on to the stage.  More exciting anticipation, waiting for the band to start. These were the days before everything was timed and computerized and it took a minute or two for the band to get started once they got on stage.  Jagger walks back and forth a bit then mumbles into the microphone, something like, \\"Let's go, Keith\\".  Then Keith rips into \\"Brown Sugar\\", the crowd roars and you can just feel the excitement from the crowd.  You want to stand up and cheer watching it in your living room!  That lasts all of a fraction of the opening riff before the crowd sound is completely mixed out of the sound.  That's kind of it for the rest of the film.  No crowd.  I mean, this is a concert film.  Shouldn't we have some sense of the crowd?<br /><br />What follows is maybe the worst directed rock concert film of all time.  The camera shots are way too limited and usually too close up.  The sense of the size of the concert and event is lost in the viewing.  One great example -- for the song, \\"Happy\\", Keith sings lead, but the camera focuses on Mick Jagger, who is standing with his back to the audience waiting for Keith to sing.  The stage light is also on Mick as he frantically points toward Keith, signaling, \\"Over there!  I'm not singing this one, Keith is!\\"<br /><br />However, the Stones sound fantastic and are at their live concert peak.  Mick Taylor is a master on guitar throughout.  The rhythm section of the band, Keith, Bill and Charlie drive the songs with a steady intensity.  Funny for those who know Keith only from his image as a mumbling, incoherent smack-addict, it is stunning to watch him in this film.  Keith is a study in concentration during the performances.  He frequently turns back toward Charlie, focusing on keeping the rhythm of each song on track.  Great shot of Keith in the opening song, \\"Brown Sugar\\" as he plays in the background and grooves and lip syncs along with Mick.  Keith has rehearsed a great band for this tour and he is enjoying the product of his hard work.<br /><br />\\"All Down the Line\\" is my favorite performance of the film.  The band hits such a groove that you even catch the stoic Mick Taylor bopping his head a bit.  And no one seems to be enjoying the performance more than Mick Jagger himself, who at the end of the song appears to be dancing more to entertain himself than to please the crowd.  Other highlights of the show for me were \\"Brown Sugar\\" and any song with Mick and Keith together at the microphone (\\"Happy\\", \\"Dead Flowers\\").<br /><br />A must-have for Stones fans.  Yes, the film has its flaws, but no one is going to time travel back to 1972 and film us a better Stones concert.

B002IDDRT8|5.0|Outlander was a fun watch!<br /><br />Now, this is not an Oscar-type movie.  Nor does it have the detailed character interplay and development of a Jane Austin film.<br /><br />But it is a highly entertaining sci-fi movie, set back in Viking days (an interesting twist), with a \\"Predator\\" type feel to it (even an alien \\"dragon\\")!  There's surprisingly good acting here, even when it's not Caviezel, interesting characters, actual character development, and man vs. man conflict as well as man vs. monster.  It's fast-paced, there's tons of action, the characters jump out from the screen as real people that you quickly come to care about, and there's even a small tint of romance.  For Jim Caviezel fans, here he is heroic and trustworthy and gallant, angst-ridden, and for those who appreciate this kind of thing, so very easy on the eyes.<br /><br />It does dip into some gore, so to speak, from time to time.  The \\"dragon\\" is not tidy, and there is real swordplay with what are probably realistic results, blood and death-wise.  I'm not a big fan of gore myself, but this was within my boundaries.  However, I've observed my tolerance for this is a bit higher than some other women, so beware if the occasional severed arm would offend you.<br /><br />My recommendation:  if you liked Alien, or Predator, and you enjoy a good sword-type movie (vs. guns) - get some friends together, hand out the popcorn, and enjoy the story!  For this genre, \\"Outlander\\" is at the top of it's class.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|First let it be understood that I am a Tim Burton fan. Something in his style and hius choice and treatment of material speaks strongly to something don't ask what!) in me. I like the macabre, with or without a twist of wry humor. I have to say that \\"Dark Shadows is not first-rate Burton.  The script is a bit loose. His desire to include as many references as possible to the original TV series (which ran a long time) make for a scattershot story whose line must twist and zigzag to allow for the bits. That did not bother me too much. The film also boasts a very good cast, and gives nearly everyone something fun to do. A guilty pleasure? Perhaps -- but a pleasure nonetheless.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Awesome book especially if you love dogs. Very insightful, from a dogs point of view. Enjoyed the book immensely, enjoy
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Somehow I knew this would stink. Despite me hoping it woudn't, it just STANK. Besides Charlize Theron, there is not one redeaming quality about this film. I have no idea what the director was thinking. How did this movie come to pass and why did it make so much money at the box office???<br /><br />So many issues with this film-where to begin?! Kristen Stewart. Sigh. Very pretty but seriously, utterly, devoid of any emotion aside from uncomfortable confusion. I have not seen any of her more independant films, but I hear she can actually act. Not seeing it here. The story goes, when the girl(Snow White) comes of age(I'm merely assuming it's 16) she will be the most fairest of them all bla bla bla and destroy the evil Queen and her reign of terror. Oh, and I guess that includes leading an army and actually FIGHTING with a large sword that she apparently has never used before and -Oh by the way she was locked up since forever in a dark, cold tower away from the world but she acts completely normal.<br /><br />The Huntsman: Another huge sigh. Was he called that because he was supposed to be hunting Snow White(whom he finds in a matter of minutes it seems) or is he a renown huntsman of some kind? And what the heck was up with that ridiculous half scottish, half something accent Helmsworth was attempting to use? His character is so pointless it hurts.<br /><br />The Dwarves: Again. POINTLESS. The action. Pointless. Plot. Stupid. Why are there 5 star reviews of this??? Is this literally the best thing they've ever watched?<br /><br />Charlize Theron as the evil queen did a fair job and actually ACTED, but even she couldn't lift this film past anything watchable. It's just very dissapointing to watch something, that could have gone a completely different way, but was just so blah.
0345803493|4.0|The first book, Fifty Shades of Grey actually had an interesting plot, but it got a little boring in the middle of the book, as the xxx scenes got a little too repetitive. It ended leaving you wondering more about Christian Grey's background and what made him the way he is, which is why I bought the sencond book, Fifty Shades Darker. I'm in the middle of the book and am not finding out much more about him.  Pretty much same old stuff as the first book. I heard from others that the sequels are not great, and that you don't found out anything earth shattering. The books are not boring, and make for easy reading, but are a little disappointing with character development.
030758836X|4.0|This is the first book by Gillian Flynn I've read, but I will most certainly be reading more by her. This is the kind of book you just can't put down. Every chapter's ending leaves you wanting to find out more. I pretty much devoured this book. I don't want to get into it too much because this is one of those books where the less you know, the better. All I will say is, the book is written in 3 parts, and switches point of views between the two main characters-Nick and Amy. Husband and wife. To know more about their relationship would be to ruin this book. One day, Amy goes missing, and from then on it's a page-turner. Every chapter is a mystery that demands to be unraveled.<br /><br />Flynn is an amazing story-teller. This book would be lifeless and cliché if she wasn't so prepared, so precise. Like a great action film, she had me pretty much on edge the whole time. Is this book perfect? No. I can nitpick things here or there, and most would do the same, especially with the ending. I'm not going to because, it wasn't what I was expecting. It made me mad, irritated, but not in a bad way. This won't make sense except to those who have read the book. It's just so different, and I love things that are not ordinary. This book could have had a different ending, and it could have been boring. Or predictable. This book is neither of those things. I must say, less than half-way through this book I sort of had it figured out. Too many clues were given, but even then, it didn't lessen my enjoyment. In fact, I was intrigued further by the turn of events.<br /><br />Side note: I noticed a review stating he/she thought the point-of-views to be confusing. Really? You can't distinguish between 2 different timelines??  I had to laugh at that one.<br /><br />I urge people to read Gone Girl. It is a quick, twisty and well-written book that won't dissapoint.
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|This movie speaks out to those who are living a pointless life and want to change it. By far it is one of my most favorite movies with an amazing soundtrack. It definitely has a twisted ending, but its perfect!

0345803485|2.0|A friend recommended this book to me. I think it's because I enjoy the psychological aspects of characters. There are a few things that struck me right away.<br /><br />1. The book is set in Seattle with characters that have always lived in the U.S. Why are they using terms like \\"ringing\\" someone up and going to the \\"cinema\\"? These are purely British terms. It's like the editors of this book had no brain when they were reviewing it.<br />2. Their relationship reminds me of Edward and Bella in the Twilight series. He seems to be under the impression that he is her Father and he should tell her how to live her life...like Edward. I know, I know...he's a Dominant. That explains it but it really reminds me of the way Edward treats Bella.<br />3. Sex. Sex all the time. Doesn't this man run a multibillion dollar company? How does he have the time to take off all weekend to have all this sex? I'm not a prude in any sense but some of the sex scenes are a bit much.<br />4. The writing. Really? I read a review from someone who wondered if a teenager had written the book. I can see her point. The writing is juvenile at best. I would think that publishers would have more taste when reviewing and selecting books.<br /><br />I am frankly appalled that this book has garnered so much attention. If this is how easy it is to publish a book, I should get into the running. It is erotica. Are the sales limited to those over 18? I would hope so. I would not want my teenagers reading this material. I don't even recommend it to my friends.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is an interesting read from a psychological standpoint. I am curious about the reasons that people get into these types of situations. If I had a friend that was acting like Ana does after she meets him, I would be as concerned as Kate is. She cries, CRIES, when he beats her the first time. She felt demeaned and rightly so. His excuse that he does it for their mutual sexual gratification is manipulative and abusive. Thisbook perpetuates abusive relationships under the guise that he gave her the choice (which is true) and that incredible sex is worth losing your self worth. There's a reason why she struggles against it but the sex is so addicting that she agrees to it.<br /><br />There are many people who love this book. The book is a different type of book not generally seen in the Best Seller's list. It explores a mostly taboo subject. Maybe people are drawn to it because they want something new in their lives. Maybe there are more doms and subs out there than we think. I'm not sure. All I know is that the book leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. I feel sorry for Ana and Christian. They are getting into an abusive situation that cannot end well.

B003OPUZYY|5.0|I really liked Ten Years After when the band was active back in the early 1970s and I recently decided to preserve some of my old vinyl Ten Years After LPs - reducing the wear and tear of playing them - by getting the CDs of those albums.<br /><br />I found this one on Amazon and decided to buy this as a cost effective way of preserving 5 1960s and 1970s era vinyl LPs with one CD set.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile way of doing that. This 3 CD set contains five complete Ten Years After albums: SSSSH, Cricklewood Green, Watt, A Space In Time and Rock and Roll Music To The World.<br /><br />The sound on the CD mastering is very good. Overall, a very cost effective way to buy these five albums.<br /><br />I've noticed Chrysalis Records is gradually releasing these 3 CD sets of 1970s artists who recorded on the label. They've released two Robin Trower sets as well as this Ten Years After set.

This book is honestly the most beautiful book I have ever read - I have no words!<br /><br />I don't know what I can say that others haven't said before me, but I can warmly recommend this book!!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|As with \\"A Game of Thrones\\" I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am quite happy that the author hasn't killed off my favorite characters...yet. I'm already half way done with the third book in this awesome series, and have come to realize that I'm absolutely addicted to this author's writing! I'm especially impressed with the dialogue, which defines each character in their own unique way. It is obvious that the author spent a lot of time building a plot where nothing can be predicted; the well-imagined world these characters live in, and making it easy for readers to slip away from reality and experience, rather than read about, these characters' daily ups and downs. I can see why this was made into a TV series: it's just so darn addictive!
0385344333|3.0|Just finished this one. Read about 100 pages/day which is to say it's a pretty fast read. Not as bad as people are saying, though it is a bit long. Child is great at creating scenes of desolation and loneliness along with some great twists. I may be going on a limb here but I think he lays some of the groundwork for Reacher's demise towards the end. All in all it's a good read.<br /><br />By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
0061743526|5.0|A very dear friend of mine insisted I drop everything and read this book immediately! I was a little reluctant to do so as I was always mistakenly under the impression that \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is an old-English, Shakespearean-like read for highly educated scholars. I wouldn't understand a thing of it and be bored out of my mind, was what I thought. Oh boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. Never before have I fallen in love with so many characters in one book, as I have in this one. For as long as it took me to finish this book, I was part of a close-knit community in a small town, with all its daily ups and downs. I walked in so many characters' shoes; I got to see every facet of human nature from various angles. I have experienced every emotion a reader could possibly get out of a one-of-a-kind book, and I grew as a person.<br /><br />Someone once asked me to define a \\"talented\\" writer. I had many answers to that question, but in hindsight, the answer should've only been this: Harper Lee is the epitome of a talented writer. Her writing is pure liquid gold and it leaves you in awe.<br /><br />If you haven't yet read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", you haven't yet experienced ultimate reading bliss. You can take my word for it. I highly recommend this unforgettable, thought-provoking, beautifully-written, delightfully charming book to absolutely everyone. No matter what your age, no matter what your genre preference - you have to read this book! It's a classic for a reason.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Whenever one is reading a series, there is the risk that the author will run out of things to say or challenges for the hero(es) to overcome.  Rick Riorden has, so far, avoided that pitfall.  Once again, he has given us a rollicking good time with plenty of adventure, just enough romance and a goodly dose of history and mythology.  I had been under the mistaken impression that this was going to wrap up the series so I was a bit disappointed to find out I have to wait another year for the next installment but, he left us with a great cliffhanger and I definitely cannot wait until the next one arrives.
B008RC72G8|1.0|i bought this movie because i have always loved dark shadows.  well barnabas collins this is not. i fell asleep watching it. anyone not familiar with the original dark shadows would probably enjoy it.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Very nice read with a scientific take on magic. Decent love story. Decent action. Decent magic (but there could have been more) and almost no sword play... Well here's hoping for the next book in the series (which I just bought).  Read this book. It's worth it. :-)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read Gone Girl in two days. I was totally gone from reality because I could NOT put it down. It demands your attention, approval, and praise.
1616960922|5.0|Many, like myself, enjoy Brandon's works due to their length, depth of world building and character development contained therein.  That being said, I was a bit hesitant on dropping $10 for one of his shorter works.  Despite being relatively unimpressed with The Alloy of Law, I took the dive and was more than pleasantly surprised with The Emperor's Soul.<br /><br />More than impressed actually.  The combination of the unique story, its tie-ins with Elantris, and the vividness of the characters placed this on the level (or higher) of his past works.  While I wish the story could have kept going, I realize now that it has never been the length of his stories that kept me coming back.  It's the realistic, introspective characters who fill the vast and exciting worlds he creates.<br /><br />Defiantly one of his best.  Thanks Brandon!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|The best scenes in this movie were in the trailers, the movie itself was a letdown. I was very disappointed in it. The original series was admittedly campy but had a certain amount of intrigue. The movie was just lame.
0062124293|5.0|This book had me guffawing out loud, night after night, with my husband looking across the couch at me like I was crazy.  I originally borrowed it from the library, but marked so many passages to read again and remember to use that I ended up buying the book, plus several more copies to give to my friends.  One of my friends had already done the same thing - bought ten copies just to hand out to every lady and college-age girl she knew would approve.  So spread the fun and spread the word ladies - you will want to own this book.  A good time is being had by all!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My three year old asks to play this game all day long. If he can do it, that shows how simple and fun it is!
B002QF31HQ|1.0|I have bought my favorite Yes LP's on vinyl and have had return all of them due to worpping and Skipping.<br />I don't get it, they want us to start buying Vinyl LP's again and we get crap. If its 180/200 gram LP from FridayMusic, save your money, you'd be better off finding an old used copy online, I have 25 year old LP's that sound better. My last purchase I bought Close to the Edge, Relayer, and a old Roger Daltrey ($5.99) and the Daltrey was perfect.....<br />Not a FridayMusic fan !!!!
B009NQKXYK|2.0|We were pretty excited to see this film.  It was entertaining, but once seeing the ships crew, became too far fetched.  The story seemed to have too many holes in it.  It could be really cool and is pretty good if you can look past the parts that make it totally not believable.  It is entertaining all the same.  Give it a watch and see if it's any good in your eyes.  Not worth $3 rental in my eyes.
B0028INIWE|5.0|There's not a lot to say about this album that isn't obvious from the track listing. I don't know how many decades are represented here but, I consider this compilation to be snapshots of one of the great rock groups of our time and an expression of who they were at each stop along the way.<br /><br />I'm okay with Amazon automatically adding a copy of the album to iTunes but it's a bit of a hassle when I move the albums from the Amazon folder to one I've already created. Gotta have iTunes prompt a search for the location of the song that is no longer in the Amazon folder. Great concept but room for improvement. However, I've come to rely on my smartphone and prefer to use Amazon Cloud Player when Wi-Fi is available. There's a lot I like about the way Amazon delivers content. And, a lot to like about The Very Best of Greatful Dead.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Excellent in every sense is the best movie ever in 3D is awesome, recommended 100%, you don't disappointed for the purchase.
0525953728|5.0|How do you describe the amazing talents of the Seals?  As a former Air Force member, I saw some of these amazing men when stationed in the Philippines.  What I thought were amazing was these guys did not want any recognition but did the job.  This book sadly is still in the news but where the book resulted in no casualties other than the enemy, now we have leadership who procrastinated prior to the Bin Laden raid and just recently did the same in Libya but the result in Libya was the death of loyal Americans just doing their jobs.  I think the author should be commended in that all profits are donated to the families of deceased Seals.  An inspiring book based on today.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed this book but it's not one you can't put down.  I will read the third.  I had to know what all the talk was about and now must finish the series.  I like it.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable book with lots of word play and enough plot twists --mysterious libraries, strange book shop patrons--to move the story forward. Ok, it did have a couple slow spots towards the end, but they weren't significant enough to spoil the fun. This book isn't a deep literary experience and it isn't meant to be. It's light, charming and a pleasure to read.
B000148KK2|5.0|I love every single song on this magnificent CD.  Diana Krall has the voice of an angel and plays the piano beautifully.  I consider this perfect, calming rainy day/lazy Sunday music.  No matter how often I listen to it, it never gets old.  'Narrow Daylight' is my favorite song, but they all resonate in my soul.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|An unusual story by Albom.  Very different in that it's not about his personal experience with anyone he knows, and yet he winds a good tale with a familiar moral throughout.
B002WWKZJK|2.0|I have read nearly all of Heyer's books at this point and this was my least favorite.  I just didn't buy Horry as a character.  She was boldly matter of fact and practical about the realities of an arranged marriage and then turned into a confirmed pea-goose once the deed was done.  There are many wonderful Georgette Heyer's books to chose from - you should indeed chose another.
111846446X|5.0|Gareth Halfacree and Eben Upton's RASPBERRY PI USER GUIDE is a must purchase for the first time owner of the credit card sized educational computer, the Raspberry Pi. The Pi computer is simplicity itself, and deserves a work like this to get the user up and running. It IS NOT an in-depth reference or thorough user guide. It IS a work that will get one up and running with all of the most important aspects of the 256K Raspberry Pi. Note that the primary focus is on the revision B Pi (the one with the two USB ports). After a brief history of the Pi project, the user is given straightforward directions on hooking it up to monitors and keyboards. After simple directions on getting an operating system \\"flashed\\" on an SD card, you're off.<br /><br />By the end of this book, you will be shown the basics of Linux administration, mostly in the context of configuring the Pi and setting it up on a network. The rest of the book leads users to install home theater software, web servers, and several programming environments. In no way will you be an expert in any of these areas, but you WILL be up and running and ready to proceed a lot deeper in any direction of personal interest.<br /><br />Think of this book as the manual that comes with your new car. It's got every thing you need to get up and running, but if you want to tinker you'll need more information!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|[[ASIN:0446580848 The Panther (John Corey)]]Wonderful book.  Compares to The Lion.  Hard to put down.  Have read everything Nelson DeMille has written.  He is the best!!!!
B007PFD90G|4.0|I bought this because of a compelling excerpt in the New Yorker magazine. I have since spent nearly a month working through it, and here is the best response I can manage.<br /><br />Rushdie is a brilliant writer. As a prose stylist, he knows and employs every possible strategy of irony and comedy. He shifts well to fit the content he is describing. And he has much to say that is memorable. I have used my Kindle bookmark function extensively, more so than with any other book, to identify passages to which I wish to return, or which I wish to share with others. It is a book I will remember, and often wish to reference.<br /><br />But though he is brilliant, Rushdie also comes off here as a self-regarding, self-aggrandizing person who manages to emerge from a memoir (presumably written for people who consider his life of interest) looking excessively full of himself. I suppose that I should praise him for being honest enough about his thoughts and actions to allow this judgment to be available. So I will. Good job.<br /><br />No one reading this memoir could suppose Rushdie to be just plain folks. He is consistently a bon vivant (even under the fatwa), consistently wealthy, constantly flattered with honors and lectures and awards. People devote their lives and careers to defending his interests as he becomes a socio-cultural symbol. He gives lists of literati and occasional movie stars who are his dear friends, creating the impression that the restrictions imposed upon him by the fatwa were largely an inconvenience to his shining upper-crust lifestyle of dinner parties and drinking with nigh every famous writer of cultural note. This is the bulk of his narrative (though not the heart), and it has the effect of muting my ability either to pity Rushdie (which he does not ask for) or to admire him for standing up for free speech (which he might perhaps welcome, or which at least he is used to).<br /><br />I'm not saying Salman Rushdie is or was a bad man. So long as you are not married to him, he seems to be a loyal and loving friend. Clearly, he is a man of principle in regard to the arts, which is not the worst thing to be. And if so many people really do like him, there must be a reason. If I had access to the literati, and to giving lectures and such, I would live as he has lived. Who can blame him?<br /><br />To balance against my impression of him as a pompous, blathering philanderer (and he does express regret about his philandering), there is vast humor in this  book, emerging with brilliance from the murk of dinner parties, name-dropping, and posturing as bright ripe berries might emerge from a dung-colored bush. And wherever the folderol is not, there is meditation upon mortality, and there is touching depiction of his deep devotion to his family, including a moving, elegiac account, near the end, of the death of his first wife Clarissa. And there are accounts of the development of his literary ideas, although they are few and rare compared to the far less valuable accounts of his conviviality.<br /><br />The fault for this may well lie with Rushdie's editor. The editor should have confronted him with the textual imbalances and urged him to bolster those portions that deal best with his legacy. If Rushdie comes off as neurotic and self-centered in this book, as if trying both to lionize and to justify himself, then this may be because the focus of the book is defined by its page to page content, rather than its superb high points. Rushdie does acknowledge his mistakes as mistakes, and he does blame himself for the majority of them, and to his credit, he thanks people who should be thanked.<br />Perhaps the honesty of this representation is better, and perhaps there is a greater value in the oxymoronic depiction of a noble sybarite, than in the properly pitched version I have faulted the editor for failing to demand.  Perhaps it is the measure of a great memoir that it reflects and embodies the contradictions of its authoras this one does.as this one does.
0316789798|5.0|Purchased these on the advice of our schools art teacher. They have step by step instructions on how to draw things. Makes drawing accesable for all. My older son has some minor OT issues and feels he doesn't draw we'll. after using these books he was MUCH more likely to sit down and just color for fun.

B006ICOK00|4.0|I spent two days trying to dump videos from camera to my computer using a usb cable. Then I learned from another review that the usb cable is only for external power. I had to buy a card reader and remove the SD card from the camera each time to transfer videos to my computer for viewing. The poorly written manual and description of this camera on amazon needs to be more clear on this fact. I was very frustrated during those two days and almost returned it. Another problem is the small LED that blinks as it takes pics. It's impossible to see outside in bright light and you really don't know if it's actually taking the shots that you want. A brighter, bigger LED would help. Once I struggled through the learning curve, I am very pleased with the videos I have taken with it. I highly recommend that you get a IKEA egg timer to take sweeping videos ( up to 360*) with the camera riding on top of it. It's less than a smooth sweep, but it works. Check on youtube for samples of videos taken using this technique. I'm very pleased that batteries last a long time with the Brinno TLC 200. I'd recommend this fun gadget to anyone who enjoys playing with time lapse videos. I was also pleased that vids from this camera can be processed in my Pinnacle Studio HD Ultimate Collection program to add music and other effects. Also upgrade to the 32 Gig SD card so you have lots of space for your creations. I wish this neat little camera was waterproof. Maybe the next model will upgrade some features. In the meantime, I'll enjoy what I have.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you did not see this theaters and are a fan of comic book movies, this is a MUST HAVE!! Definitely the best comic movie ever or possibly second to the last Batman movie. Excellent. Received everything as advertised as always with Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good and challenging game.  Can spend hours playing but it is very hard to unlock new levels.  Otherwise would rate five stars.
1476712042|4.0|I just want the readers to know this is a fun youthful book that made my giggle and I enjoyed it so very much! It is about the young impulsive love but I just enjoyed it so much despite how irrational they could both be! I loved it and I think you will too! Give it a try and I know you will love this bad boy and Abby is a great surprise too.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Just a take off of Angry Birds, but from the pigs point of view I guess. I am not going to keep this product however because I do not think it is all that interesting.
B00846REIS|2.0|I love chick lit! I was disappointed at the similarities with this book and 50 shades. I was interested in the series due to my friends discussion about it. I just was very surprised by the characters being so similar and the themes being the same. I didn't care for this book. I will admit, it was written better than fifty shades.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really liked this book. I thought that author did a better job with the plot and the ending is worth the 300 pages!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a great game. I am so addicted! Easy to download and install. Come Check out Filmon.com for FREE TV! A+++
B0096HIEE2|4.0|I like this movie a lot. It's not just about just striping eventhough it's nice to watch them dance. It's about finding yourself and wanting to be more in life.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. Definitely a page turner.  I loved it and can't wait for the next one.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its is fun but it gets weird so ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
0763652245|5.0|My 16 month old loves this book so much, she already loved the first copy to death. This is a lift the flap book with a twist- you can lift each flap two ways. One way will show you something nice like strawberry tea or cans of beans and macaroni. The other way shows you something yucky like frog spawn or goblin pee. My kid thinks this book is hilarious, and she loves looking at both sides of the flaps to shout out YUM! or YUCK!<br /><br />The rhymes and pictures are simple enough for her to enjoy now, but I think all the different patterns and the novelty of having to choose something gross or nice on each page will keep this book in rotation for a few years, if this copy lasts that long! My only complaint is that the flaps are a little flimsy. I don't see how they could have made it better, the ingenious design limits the strength of the paper, but this isn't really designed for small, rough toddler hands.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Great Product, on time delivery. My experience with this season was so awesome it blew my mind in a sit on the couch and explode kind of way. I haven't been the same since.
0984999302|5.0|Several people recommended this book to me and I'm very glad they did. Steve Blank is a teacher at heart. He understands why there is a need for this kind of material in this sort of an economy. No matter if you are an MBA or High School graduate and starting your own business I recommend getting this book. Also check out his FREE online course on Udacity.com (EP245) which complements this book. Do it NOW!
0525958002|2.0|with its two and three page chapters, it's a written version of MTV with the attention span of a gnat. I don't think John Taylor himself remembers a good deal of what happened to him, hence the gaps, as he meets and loses supermodel Renee Simonsen as a significant other as if he were changing shirts. I thought the parts with his dad were special but otherwise, not too much here, as \\"vacations\\" in Antigua turned into monumental videos almost by accident and his illfated attempts to reach out with Power Station seem as dreadful in retrospect as they did at the time. Odd that Andy Taylor, one of the original five, wasn't listed with the others as \\"inspirations\\" at the back so i suspect there's no love lost there. Not much good about Simon LeBon either except that he has a good name and good hair. Interesting when Andy Warhol encourages Taylor to take over as lead vocalist, he declines. Good move.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|by any means but this one is a winner, although i'm not sure how he can make his wife HB Carter look as hideous as she does in this one and still be married to her, but that's for them to sort out. Michelle Pfieffer does almost as well with comedy as she did in Hairspray and the soundtrack with the Moody Blues and the Carpenters stands on its own. i almost expected Lynn Anderson's \\"Never promised you a rose garden,\\" it's that 70's. Eva Green, so good in the Dreamers and Casino Royale is stunning as femme fatale Angelique (or was it Angel?). Some parts are too graphic for kids and the kids in this movie aren't of the sheltered variety but all in all, good fun. Johnny Depp has some good oneliners and even when he doesn't, he seems to do wry irony well, even if unspoken. Watched this one more times than i care to count.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i LOVE this game is just like temple run but this game is a lot better p.s.  sorry temple run
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I have all the underworld series dvd,s. Underworld Awakening was one of the better ones. And Kate Beckinsale is still looks very good, good enough to eat!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|nice graphics, pretty accurate, easy to use. I've been looking for a weather app for a while, and am glad I found this one!
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Just watch the news and see how close we are to tech like this. I enjoyed this book every bit as much as the Daemon / Freedom duo. Three cheers for Suarez!
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great movie, I loved every bit of it. Rihanna did a great job, especially seeing this is her first time in a movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Its a great game to pass the time away. Especially, when your kids are at shcool or at their dads.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wonderful book!! A lot about different animals and religions and finding hope where ever you can.  Hard to put down once I started.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A friend urged me to read this book, and the description sounded a bit depressing, but she assured me that it wasn't.  It's a tough topic, but extremely well-written, with insight and humor. Although it's a YA novel, it was one of the best I've read this year!
1439152799|5.0|I hope a movie is made from this book!<br /><br />I will never forget these twins & their secrets.  The twists in this book are excellent and well worth staying up all night to read about.  This book is well worth every penny you pay for it.  A book worth reading several times over!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is great continuation of Book One. Makes history come alive. Interaltionships and political climate during WWI and WWII are fascinating and insightful. I highly recommend both books.
1416550550|4.0|This might be the first book I read by Kate Morton.  If you like mystery and lots of details this book is for you.<br /><br />From the start when a small child is found at a dock I was hooked.  This author has a super talent for developing the characters in such detail that you feel you know them ... That they are your friends.<br /><br />So grab a box of Kleenex and prepare to be transported ... Into a well written world of twists and turns!
B004SKIPXW|2.0|\\"If you kids don't shut up I am going to turn this car around and go home!\\"<br /><br />Fine, see if we care. Drive Angry is not worth the time or money. It's just pure drivel with no idea of what direction its going in, setting up possible subplots and tangents and either killing them immediately or just abandoning them.<br /><br />Nic Cage, on a career nosedive that would make Cuba Gooding Jnr. and Val Kilmer shriek, plays Milton (get it?) an outlaw on a confusing and boring quest for revenge against crazy cultists on the back roads of America's highways. A man in a suit known only as 'The Accountant' (William Fichtner, the ONLY reason for suffering this nonsense) is hot on his trail, keen to take him 'home'. Milton meets a stray girl, bangs a floozie, kills people, drives angry, and kills more. And I swear it is so boring you'll probably start reading a book before the credits end.<br /><br />The car chases are so poorly done, the action so flatly staged, one has to wonder if Patrick Lussier was directing this inbetween afternoon naps. A very cheap, worthless film that is not worth keeping. If you insist on ridding yourself of your hard-earned dough...give it to the poor and needy.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is in 3D 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. I was so bored-to-tears with this film I didn't even check if there were any extras.
B008476HBM|4.0|A good book and a very interest romance. An history to put in your heart and in your life. Fantastic.
1579126235|5.0|What gets me every time reading these detective murder mysteries is the amazing ability of the detective (Hercule Poirot in this case) to observe and make educated guesses about whether this or that happened; which clues are significant and which are not. The hero of these stories is in fact Poirot, not any of the characters. He is like Sherlock Holmes: he sees what other people do not see. He observes with 1000x magnification while others must be content with 2x. He logically deduces conclusions with agility, while others are left dumbfounded. In short, Poirot's reputation is well deserved. We, as readers instinctively root for him because we know that he will always get his man.<br /><br />Christie concentrates on character development. While Poirot is a familiar figure, the other characters are completely new to the reader. We have the villain Ratchett contrasted with the other passengers: Hardman, Col. Arbuthnot, Princess Dragonmiroff, Count Andrenyi, Countess Andrenyi, Mrs. Hubard, Greta Chisson, Mary Debenham, Hildegrade Schmidt, and Hector MacQueen. Each of the characters has their own peculiarities and their own reasons for being on the Orient Express. When Ratchett is murdered on board the train, it is Poirot's job to discern who the murderer is. In this case the conclusion is very unusual.<br /><br />On the whole, I enjoy reading Agatha Christie mysteries. This one in particular is iconic and makes for a good character study. It also helps to see the movie to better appreciate the subtleties of the book. The book is organized to a tee and draws the reader in to drawing their own conclusions before the end of the book. Astute readers will identify the culprit (probably early on in the book), but will still enjoy the book nonetheless. Agatha Christie maintains her reputation with each book she wrote. While the book is somewhat formulaic in the overall structure, it is nevertheless enjoyable.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I read through the whole book intent on finding out the truth and guess what, it leaves you hanging.  The characters are complex and well written.  I really enjoyed it up to the end and then I was very disapointed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this way to much.But it is because I enjoy being able to just touch it and it goes to the next available space.  Good work!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and consider it to be superior than the Harry Potter books. Similiar in many ways with 'peculiar' people trying to exist in a world of normals, the author uses photographs to add an air of mystery and nostalgia. Now, the photos and some hand written letters are embedded in the novel so for Kindle users I would suggest downloading the Kindle App on your workstation and viewing them there because on a smaller device they don't show up well. I grew fond of Jacob and his relationship with the peculiar children, especially Emma. Hidden away on a small island off Wales, the writer fits a timeline with real historical significance such as The Battle of Britian in World War 2, the Holocaust, and other unsolved world mysteries. I really enjoyed the writing style in the first person; it worked extremely well for this book. Again, I enjoyed it better than Harry Potter series and hope for many sequels.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Regardless of the controversy around this book and author, I thought it was a great, easy read that was very informative. It is great to hear the personal account of a Seal's career.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|i FOUND THIS MOVIE FUNNY THROUGHOUT ENDING KINDA LAME BUT STILL WORTH THE WATCH. I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BUY IT. THE TWIST AND TURNS WILL HAVE YOU ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING. IF YOU LIKE HILLBILLY SLASHER FLICKS YOU WILL LOVE THIS GOOD ACTING GOOD GORE TWO OUT OF THREE MISSING NAKED  ANY ONE OF THESE MAKES A GOOD SLASHER FLICK PLUS COMEDY MAKES THIS ALMOST A GREAT MOVIE.
B008966SIU|1.0|The first few minutes of \\"Yet Again\\" were palatable.  \\"Speak In Rounds\\" is decent too.  Everything else is a waste of time.
B008220CFG|5.0|I went to go see this movie in the theaters with my husband, not knowing what to expect except that I read it was based off a true story.  I sat there throughout the movie, gripping my husband's arm.  I even jumped a couple of times.  I don't know why it got such bad reviews from others; I can't wait 'til it comes out so I can buy it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Another great book couldnt put it down read it in 2 days! Prob gog to read all three of them again!
B008KE3960|1.0|Game is good, but they need to be clear about what \\"Free\\" means... you can only unlock couple maps by playing, then you can't progress farther unless you buy each map for $0.99 or $2.99 map pack!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was outstanding. I could not put it down and glad I didn't. What a mission and the training to get there. These guys make us proud.
B000UBQO9K|5.0|I heard today that Mr. Callier had died, and Chris Matthew mentioned him. Apparently, he was into music a number of years ago, but gave it up and went into computer programming so he could put his two kids through college. He released an album in London a few years ago and his music career was reborn. I'm sorry I didn't know him till now. He has an ecclectic style that combines folk and jazz, with a little blues thrown in. Buy it. You'll like him.
B00979CS50|4.0|Over his career, Neil Young has released an amazingly diverse collection of albums, from Folk to country, to swing, to that Peter Frampton voice-altering device on \\"Trans\\", you never really knowing what going to come next.<br />Unless of course it's an album featuring Crazy Horse, then you can pretty much anticipate a grungy, live in the studio, slightly self-indulgent type shenanigans.<br />Saying all that, there is a real energy & enthusiasm to Young's collaborations with Crazy Horse that crackles throughout the album.<br />It's perhaps a little more polished, refined & laid back than pervious works with C.H, but that's no bad thing, giving the songs a bit more accessibility.  The Vocals & Harmonies seem stronger as well, which have always been a bit of an acquired taste when listening to Young.<br />My only nit-pick would be all the publicity surrounding the duration of some of the songs on the album, opening track \\"driftin' back\\" clocks in at a whopping 27 minutes. In years to come, the album may become famous/infamous for length of the songs, similarly to when Dylan's \\"Bringing it all back home\\" which had all the \\"going electric\\" controversy surrounding it, which would be a really shame, as I thinks this is the strongest Young/Crazy Horse project since \\"Ragged Glory\\".<br />You even get some whistling, which is always nice to hear on a record.
0425263916|3.0|I liked the story - and people need to remember it is fiction.  I like how the ending is a police women's \\"theory\\" of what happened.  Gideon didn't admit to anything.  I like how Ms Day lets us think what we want.  People said this is like \\"Shades\\" but clearly it's not.  Gideon and Eva are nothing like Christan and Anna, but thats ok - both series have their redeeming qualities.  I was a little disturbed with one particular series of events - the concert.  The aftermath in the limo was kinda hot, but then when you really look at what she did and what he did to get the truth out - well yikes!<br /><br />I am looking forward the the third book - and I wish they were put out a bit closer together - it's such an on-going story that waiting is difficult.  I actually reserved Bared to You again from the library because it's been a while and I need to read it again to fill in a few blanks.

I loved that they gave the science behind everything - and for you non-science people out there, their analogies and explanations are super easy to understand!  Read this book and become enlightened! I'm starting my Whole30 in January!

It is like visiting with an old friend that you have not seen in a while and want to know everything that has happened.  I am ready for the next book!  Thanks Patricia Cornwell!!
