B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I bought his album the moment it was announced.  I agree with all the praise and positive comments about Phillip -- the man, the instrumentalist, and the singer. I love Phillip World (including, of course, his beautiful album)  His sound his so distinctive, you'll know within seconds that it is him.  While driving with his CD playing, I actually take a longer route to hear more, as his music starts and ends my day.  Can't wait for his next one too!!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|this movie was very inturesting and very funny and emotional. i cant wait for my mother to watch it so that we can talk about it i think the movie is a reflection of me mine and my mothers relationship.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my son.  He loves it and I was very happy with the price and quick service.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Do yourself a favor save $1 and 2hrs of your life! Go buy a hammer for $2 bucks and smack yourself in the head! I cannot believe there are 42 people in this world that think this movie is worth 5cents! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|This is a great movie for action and acting.  The story line was consistent with the prior trilogy and kept us interested from beginning to end.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Have this game on another device (with different account) and liked it enough to have it on this device (;
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was very realistic and adorable. It's a great story about friends growing up together and the book itself is a very easy read.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I read this book based on word of mouth.  Everybody is talking about it.  I was shocked and horrified that such things as the author writes about, exist.  It boggled my mind that somebody as Christan Grey (be he ever so fictional), could exist and treat women as he does, and indulge in such depravity.  What intrigued me most, was how he amassed such wealth at such a young age, and how he maintained such a top job with his mind and attention almost 100% on e-mailing his girlfriend. I read this book as if it was a psychological thriller, not as a masterpiece of erotica.  I do not particularly like the explicit descriptions of the uncoventional sex scenes.  But I do like the writer's style.  It is entertaining, and I was kept in suspense.  I wondered throughout the book if the depraved Mr Grey was going to pull the lovely Miss Steele right into his depraved web, or if it would be the lovely Miss Steele who would gradually introduce him to the more normal and less depraved way of life and love.  It was pleasantly surprised that it seemed to be Miss Steel who was heading for the win.....
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Had me glued.  I couldn't put it down. Gideon is so hot. Time for book 3, Entwined. I am enjoying this Crossfire series.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|both Claire and Damian deserved their awards<br />It has drama, romance, thrill, reality,danger and it touches our sensitivity because of the threat and risk linked to current political issues.
B008OTTRXU|4.0|Carly Rae Jepsen is talented. I sing along to the song &#34;Call Me, Maybe&#34;, which is why I really bought the CD in the first place. Some other songs are nice listening and may be future hits.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|Smart, intelligent, gripping, pure entertainment! Once again, the authenticity of Cornwall's plot is masterfully entertwined with well-defined characterization - a must-read!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|A fan of SOA. What can be wrong with this season. I'll be collecting any more seasons to add to my vault.
1601254679|5.0|Even the most prepared GM can get caught flatflooted by their players (afterall they do outnumber us), and you find yourself needing a cast member you hadn't remotely planned for. The Codex has numerous characters from all the major classes presented in the Core book, along with variations. It even has write-ups and progressions of the so-called &#34;Iconic Characters' (like Seoni, a fan favourite) seen in various Pathfinder modules over the years. However, its not just for GMs, players will find a wealth of character concepts in here, and one can see how their own creations stack up against the personalities the game designers created.Though many of the NPCs are designed with Pathfinder's official world in mind, these can be adapted with little effort.<br /><br />All in all, its well worth the investment, and deserves a place in the GM's arsenal of tricks.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great deal when I got this, priced dropped and I had to get it, as a gift for my two year old son

B001UV4XIS|5.0|The price for this is amazing and definitely worth every single penny that I spent on it. The shipping took literally two mere days, and it's now one of my favourite movies that I own.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Good price had to jump on it when it jumped down, great gift for my two year old that is in to movies rig now.

B00AKOB7CG|5.0|all six workouts in one app! if u stick to it it will work!!!  it has a lot of excirsise to do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to admit, I read this book due to the reviews the movie had gotten. I had not seen the movie, but was intrigued. From the first sentence to the last, I was hooked. Not a word did I see out of place; no extras to distract. I would recommend this book to anyone who asks if they should read it. Wonderful!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Great movie. Anything with Emma Stone in it can't be a bad movie....a new Ferris Bueller for the next millenium?
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a good book. For young mature readers this is the book for you. It's one of those books that gets you on the edge of the seat.
B002WY65VU|5.0|One of the great movies of all time! Yes, there are Zombies but, hell, what a cast and I can't wait for the follow up!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|If you like romance novels you will like this book.  Although there are no surprises or suspense, this book does have quality romance scenes and is well written throughout.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|You can &#34;beat the clock&#34; or play classic or arcade versions.  It is addictive though.  Thats why I love it!

B004NOCCEG|3.0|paid to watch the movie in HD.  got low quality with major delays.  good movie, but amazon seems against me watching it.
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|for my kindle it was horrible no games no apps no games and I'm no longer going to buy from you and tell my friends not to buy from you.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|probably the very best free app I have come by on my kindle fire so far. its quick to load and runs smooth.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Over the past 40 years, I've collected rock music biographies and have found that Townshend's memoir is the best I have ever read.  His relaxed unassuming style of writing allows the listener to feel as if they are having a conversation with the man.  Beyond all of the interesting historical Who tidbits, this book gives the reader an intimate look of one of rock & roll's greatest artists.  A must-read...absolutely.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Excellent product. Fast performance. Compatible with all versions of MS Office. Free PDF reader. Only CONS: lacks seach in PDF.
6305428387|5.0|This is our family's favorite movie! It's funny, it's based on something that really happened, and it has a wonderful message - don't give up on your dreams.
1594744769|5.0|It takes you to a place of dark mysteries, exciting adventures, and a life time of innocence. The photography makes the story complete. The more you look at the pictures, ...the more familiar they all become. One of the best books I've read for a longtime!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Bizarre, disjointed story and action.  Too over the top with unbelievable weather disasters and other events that did not go with this particular story.  Credibility was non existent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Insight into a world I never thought to know. Best and most suspenseful book I have read in a while.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It got a little tiring watching the superheros knock each other around, but always got better when the superheroes worked together to kick some bad guy behind.  Good dialogue for the most part.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was one of those books where you can't put it down. I read through it like a storm. I would recommend this to teens and up because of mild language. This books story though is truly unique, the way the author wrote and used diction was nothing short of amazing.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Started out kind of slow and ponderous but finally found it's &#34;soul&#34; and interest grew in the characters' lives.  Happy endings for all.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I loved this book because it had an unexpected ending. That usually doesn't happen in typical romance novels. what i did not like was the fact the fell in love in 2 weeks. That is absurd.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'm a big fan of Tina Fey and Bossypants exceeded my expectations.  I was expecting funny - and it was. I was pleasantly surprised, however, by Ms. Fey's thoughtful and honest approach to some very difficult topics.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was really long... but I found out lots of new \\"z\\" words I never heard of.... it is great
B00009AOBI|1.0|i hate the boss.  i loved this movie...the original with Bob Seger soundtrack.  the boss ruined this movie for me.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was a great book to read....... but I think it is  great way to learn new words that you don't know
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Good movie.  Original better.  No issues with playing movie yet.  Some digitial copies have issues (require internet connection to just play).
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought this book had a lot of funny scenes. Although some parts were a little boring. I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, but if you haven't already read a book from the series, you would be confused.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|Have not watched movie yet, but digital security did not allow my daughter to play on laptop while we where traveling.  Very frustrating and disappointing!!!!!  Seems to work fine now that we are home and have internet connection, but still frustrating as would have been nice to watch while traveling.  Where we were staying had slow internet, so could not digital copy until got home.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was a little awkward and i could not get it to work! I hope the other Amazon books are better!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this series and already own season one. Watched this in just a few days. Make sure you order the UK edition...
B0036OS3EW|5.0|Live on a farm, run in and out frequently.  These pull on boots are warm, dry, and perfect for me.  Love 'em.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I bought this to protect my new Kindle Fire HD after watching the demo video on the product page. It's easy to use and as a stand it works amazingly well.<br /><br />It's compact, sleek and the Kindle popped right in there quickly and easily.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I expected a bigger part for Bill Murray and Frances McDormand but they actually serve as a back drop for this 1960s humorous stereotype of summer camp boy scout life featuring a very different marches to his own beat scout who sets off on his own with a frustrated homebound girl on the Island where she lives. If you got Napoleon Dynamite and liked it, this may be your movie. Otherwise this may not be your film. I enjoyed the film, mildly funny, unique story, some very unusual surprises and certainly off beat.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is the absolute best version of A Christmas Carol for families. It is very funny.  So glad to have replaced our old VHS version with the DVD.
B004EPZ084|4.0|One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Ever!  You need to see this on DVD because if you see it in a movie theater you'll miss half the funny lines due to the laughter. One complaint, and this is sad....the language is as vulgar as you can get. It is a total turn off.  Thus, tens of thousands of people will not see this movie because of the language.  The even sadder part is that it COULD have been made with minimal foul language and not lost a minute fraction of the humor.  One day Hollywood may realize that we don't need language like this to sell their movies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it! Hate that I have to wait untill feb to see the next half of the season but whatever its worth it. Rick is great in this season!
B009X00E18|1.0|I'm perplexed by this cover and stand for Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It's made by Marware, which makes good covers, but this one doesn't come up to their usual standards. It's a flimsy cover that isn't comfortable to hold while reading books and magazines on Kindle Fire 8.9, and the stand is poorly designed so that it tends to fall over if jostled at all. The front cover has a fold down the front to enable you to fold it into a stand, but this makes it awkward to use as a cover for reading on Kindle. The cover leaves all the controls and ports uncovered, but the power button is very small to begin with and this cover comes right up to the edge of it and gets in the way when you want to press the power button. I cannot recommend this cover which is overpriced and unattractive. For a lower list price you can get the [[ASIN:B009X018CW Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\"]] which has a better stand, is comfortable to hold, and even turns on the Kindle's power when you open the cover.

B0083DJWGO|4.0|This work builds on Taleb's well known title on The Black Swan - which discusses the severe impacts possible due to extremely rare, and perhaps totally unanticipated events.  He notes that while statisticians, economists, and finance professionals often ignore extremely rare events, some of these can have severe consequences (e.g. the Great Depression of '29 - 39 and the financial collapse of 2008.)<br /><br />In Antifragile, Taleb proposes the concept of Antifragility - the concept that some organisms and systems can actually be strengthened by random shocks.  He distinguishes antifragility from resilience, noting that resilience implies that an organism/ system can survive shocks or stress, while antifragile entities actually improve as a result of the stress.<br /><br />Taleb applies this principle to a variety of disciplines, including finance, management, medicine, and political organization.<br /><br />I found his thinking gave me good ideas to ponder and apply.<br /><br />He isn't shy about criticizing any number of &#34;experts&#34; for their failures or limitations, and reserves special harshness to those who (after the fact) claim to have predicted problems when in fact their work was often ambiguous.  He also questions many ideas which are sacred cows (for example, he asks for proof that education improves national economic performance.)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game because I can play this on my tablet and the computer, but the tablet is more fun to play on.
B009738XXM|4.0|It's a fun album with an interesting sound and definitely falls in the &#34;pop&#34; category. It's the sort of music you put on to play while you're driving down the road on a long road trip, especially if you have a convertible.
B00866JLEG|5.0|I love this movie so much. Zac Efron is one of my favorite actors and he does an excellent job in this movie! I will love to see him more in his movies.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I bought this movie because I thought the dancing was phenomenal.  Channing Tatum is an amazing dancer.  There really wasn't a great story line here, but I don't think anyone would expect that anyway.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|A nice new twist for old fables. Good acting. cool way of telling back ground stories of the characters. Buy it!
B00271HAK8|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of our favorite movies.  We must watch it at least once a year.  Not only is it very entertaining, it also has a deeper meaning.  I recommend it for  all parents.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love flow free cause its free and you can get alot of the levels. i would recomend it. u would see why i love it.:):):)<br />&lt;3.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app is simply amazing! Great devotionals and study aids. They even break it down in topics or focuses e.g.: family, youth, women etc.  I love it!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I enjoy fast paced action, so I gave it 4 stars. I would recommend it to others. Good. Picture. Quality.
B004I744AS|4.0|This is a solid free dictionary app. It has several definitions for each word which are also available in several different languages.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|this is the ultimate timewaster.  fun. cute.  nothing but kudos to the developers.  so far every one in the house has played and liked.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Great retro game, that will entertain you for minutes on end.  Perfect for killing time on the pot.  Similar to Rad Racer on NES, among others.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This only loads about a half dozen news feeds and then no option to see more!  Not acceptable for such a nice Kindle!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I wouldn't give this movie a second glance while it was in the theatre because I thought it would be silly. My wife and I laughed the entire movie and had to back up a couple times to make sure we were hearing the lines correctly. Have a drink, sit and relax, and get ready to belly laugh. We loved it.<br /><br />Oh, not for kids 13 and under.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|For all the &#34;Rockers&#34; that poo-poo this CD, move along.  There are enough real Rod fans, that you won't be missed.  Rod, keep em coming.  We will keep listening!
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Although certainly not her most intriguing, still very good, an easy read, something to do on a rainy afternoon,well done.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|This was actually for my husband...great quality, arrived quickly!  Love all the crisp colors that pop out--blu-ray is the way to go with this one.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved this selection, I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult and only heard of her a little more than a year ago.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This movie brings together the rhyming story of The Lorax from Dr. Seuss, a childhood favourite. It is put together with some catchy songs and beautiful graphics (especially the trees), making viewing a fun experience for all. A nice way to while away an hour or so on the weekend.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I rate this book high because of the author. The character Sherlock Holmes provides clues to the readers to allow them to help solve his case. The author, to me, is the best short story writers of all times. Holmes' character is a true classic.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love that u can choose the music that wakes u up and its really easy  too set up. would recommend for those on the go.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the best writers of his time and this book proves the point. Books by Stevenson should be required reading in the schools so upcoming author can understand the methods used to keep a reading interested in the charaters and the subject line.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app has fruit in it and fruit makes me Fat and self-conscious. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? Here are some adjectives I would use to describe it; disgusting, and chemically imbalanced<br />But other than that it was great<br />Word of advice make it cake.ninja
B004MNVKVO|5.0|I'm not reviewing the music. If you don't know about the tracks on Moving Pictures yet then just ask any Rush fan. I am, however, reviewing the 5.1 DTS Master Audio.<br />I have a humble home cinema, small Sony bookshelf speakers with  even smaller matching Sony surround and centre speakers and a Polk sub woofer. These are hooked up to a basic Onkyo receiver. I have been listening to this album since its release. I know the tracks backwards, sideways and upside down. Just like any true Rush fan I can air drum in sync every fantastic fill that Neil does. etc etc So, how is it there was so much that I had never heard before?<br /><br />The 5.1 audio in HD absolutely shines even on my simple system. The use of the surround generates effects that have the music swirling around. It really stands out on the opening triangle rhythms of YYZ. You don't have to close your eyes to hear the chimes smoothly circling you. During the opening to The Camera Eye I heard things in detail that I had never heard before. Well, I say I never heard them but obviously I did, but had never picked up on them. You get the idea The sound is stunning.<br /><br />So, if you are a Rush fan, with a blu ray and home cinema receiver, it would be too easy to say, &#34;meh, I've heard it a million times, I can't justify buying another version, how different can it be?&#34;, but if you do that you'd be making a mistake and you will miss out on yet another Rushian, Utopian experience. I nearly made the same mistake, but I bought this for my wife for Xmas as she's just as much a Rush nut as I am. We sat there with jaws dropped, grinning stupidly at each other. We immediately agreed to get the recently released 5.1 version of 2112 as well. Meanwhile I'm drooling, thinking about them giving this 5.1 treatment to some more modern releases with crisper production like Power Windows or Roll the Bones. Almost too much to bear in anticipation!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a quick read with a fun plot. The premise seemed a little predictable when I read the book description. Waking up married in Vegas is a storyline that has been done in books and movies plenty, but the author included a twist with the male lead being much more intentional than would be expected. There is also much more focus on the time after the trip to Vegas which helps really portray how a meaningful relationship starts to form. Overall, if you're looking for a fun romantic read pick up this book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Got it for free. Interesting game with nice music and picture. Amazon's free apps really get good ones, I like it.
0307744434|5.0|I read it in a little over 2 weeks and I loved every page. For whatever reason I thought it was about vampires and odd creatures when I picked it up, and when I discovered it was about magicians I did not think I would like it. I was pleasantly surprised as I was immediately engrossed in the story and the way the story was told. A very talented writer and story teller. I hope to read many more of her books in the future.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This was an excellent book. I love mystery and suspense and this book gives you both.  The story is so believable it's hard to stop reading.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Love the story lines and the Winchesters aren't bad to look at either! A mix of sci-fi, drama, and comedy.
B00785P2QC|5.0|truely amazing game! this game helps me past my time. it is a fun and addicting game. I reccomend this to everyone
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Love the story lines and the Winchesters aren't bad to look at either! A mix of sci-fi, drama, and comedy.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My 9 year old put this app on the Kindle and she and my 4 year old have not put it down. Cut, color, shampoo, add bows. Lots of fun.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Love the story lines and the Winchesters aren't bad to look at either! A mix of sci-fi, drama, and comedy.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is my all time favorite book!!  I can not wait until Walking Disaster comes out:)  If you haven't read this book, it is a must read. If you like romance, and bad boys that are CRAZY in love, this is the book for you!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Love the story lines and the Winchesters aren't bad to look at either! A mix of sci-fi, drama, and comedy.
B008MM9630|4.0|like this app.not very good girl avatars but boys look fine.tight now trying to get pet bird.loaded well and dosent freeze up on my kindle.I chose my avatar to be wild one.looks like cave girl.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Love the story lines and the Winchesters aren't bad to look at either! A mix of sci-fi, drama, and comedy.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|My daughter loves this rendition!  She was excited to see all the deleted scenes too!  Great gift and all we heard when she opened it was YEA!!!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love the story lines and the Winchesters aren't bad to look at either! A mix of sci-fi, drama, and comedy.
B000I3W1XS|5.0|Assuredly the best Star Trek movie ever made.  However, you must watch &#34;The Wrath of Khan&#34; before watching &#34;The Search For Spock to understand the history!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Started this book yesterday evening and read til my eyes dried out. Thought about it all day<br />today, came home from work, promptly sat done and finished it. Amazing and thought provoking. Would love to see this as a motion picture!
030758836X|5.0|The story kept me interested and I wanted to keep reading. I am looking forward to reading the other two books I ordered!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I have been a follower of Stephen Hunter's books for a long time.  This adaptation of his book really hit the mark.  Rarely do movies do books justice, but this one did a really good job.  I highly recommend the Bob Lee Swagger series of books as well.  Great entertainment value.
B00992CF6W|5.0|100% fun. I like it because you can do whatever you want. You can build you wildest creations, you can fight monsters, you can even start a farm. Any thing is posable with Minecraft. If you think $6.99 is to much go to you tube and watch people play it! You decide.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I agree with the others you need to fix the newsfeed and beable to refresh and show additional posts! Please fix asap!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this series. I have from the beginning. It has yet to disappoint. It is creepy without being overly gory yet it still has a humorous side to it.  .
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Wonderful modern setting of Homer's Odyssey. The late Charles Durning as Pappy O'Daniel should not be missed. The soundtrack made many blue grass converts.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|just takes forever to get energy. wish it was faster to rebuild. i wish you could visit more people with out logging to social network
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool 1 - 5 was amazing!  I fell in love with the characters and couldn't put it down because I had to learn more.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I was skeptical of this book, hoping it wasn't a Young Adult sort of fluffernutter.  It wasn't - more like Christopher Morley's The Haunted Bookshop.  It was a fun intersection of book lover-meets-high-tech-geek characters, and they were well developed.<br />Nothing too heavy here, but a pleasure to read.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I saw this movie on theaters in Costa Rica and I got so in love along with my family, that we went again to see it. Got it from amazon by pre-order at very nice price and loving it.<br /><br />Pixar should have an Oscar for the programming of Merida's hair... is amazing, outstanding!
0439023491|1.0|I really liked the first installment despite the fact that at times it felt like it was written for an audience of 14 year old girls. This second book for me was unreadable. It takes the cheesy dialogue to the extreme and I couldn't take it any more.<br /><br />The first book was obviously made into a major motion picture. Honestly I liked the movie better than the book, and I've never been able to say that.<br /><br />I recommend just watching the movies as they are released.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|cute game....taking me a minute to get the hang of it, but I can see that it's addictive! Highly recommended
B006B3975Y|4.0|The roots killed it again. Maybe not as good as How I Got Over but still really good. This album felt a little more laid back.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My grankids LOVE this.<br />It is easy to understand and navigate.<br />We wish there were alot more games for kids like this one!
1400049628|5.0|Taking zombie survival seriously and it was fun. If you read this you must read World War Z, or vice versa.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great service, and just what my sister asked for!!! With the accuracy of the order and the speed ot its arrival, I was able to complete my holiday shopping early, thank you!
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Everyone into the blues must see this recording. The title is very misleading; the line up is far, far better. The \\"Stones\\" are not in full attendence, just Jagger, Richards and Wood. But there is so much more, and the show was superb with or without them. This is blues at its authentic and entertaining best. The sound is excellent and captures the true tone of the instruments (I am a blues player). This is key to any blues concert recording. So, if you are into the blues and happen to be a Keith Richards fan (or even if you're not), get this DVD, turn it up, and get ready for a very good time! You will feel that you were there at the club with them.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books! I couldn't put it down. I've read it before but, I will continue to reread it for years to come.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|great service and pretty fast diverly  i wish you all a happy new year God Bless you and your family
B001BANK32|5.0|This is easily King's most well-written piece, and I've read many of them at this point. I saved this for later while I was working my way through his stuff (Dark Tower I-VII, Dreamcatcher, Cujo, Needful Things, IT, Tommyknockers, Skeleton Crew, Dark Half, etc).<br /><br />Jack swings from likeable to tragic to terrifying over the course of the story, in addition to the other elements of life in the Overlook Hotel that mirror his inevitable slide into insanity. At times, you identify with his hatred of Wendy constantly nagging him for sins of the past. Other times, you see Wendy's POV as her husband intentionally distances himself from the family.<br /><br />Very few novels today would tackle child abuse so frankly and openly, in addition to the themes of isolation, despair, and a cycle of violent, alcohol-fueled destruction. It's an amazing book, and should be required reading by anyone who loves great characters.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Got a new Kindle Fire HD and wanted the Facebook app for the Kindle (android OS).  It doesn't work.  It shows about ten recent posts with their related pics, then four or five older posts (words only) in blue boxes,... and that's it. Nothing else.  Apparently the updated app version came out in Sept and they still haven't fixed it?  C'mon, that's pathetic.  So I've been using something called Scope to see FB.  If not for Scope app, I would have most likely sent the Kindle back.  Never had any FB issues with my Windows based laptop or Apple iPhone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not sure what made me get this book but I'm glad I bought it. A lot of twists and turns that kept me guessing. I'm looking forward to more in the series!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Takes a bit of skill but it is a fair game. No pay to win stuff at all. Runs flawlessly on Asus tf700.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the angry birds star wars ! its helps pass the time while im waiting at the DR. and when they call me I think to my self I could have waited here alot longer ! hahaha Just wanting to get to the next level !
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is so easy to play.  I truly love it.  Now I can play anywhere and any time. I will take it will me everywhere.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This is a fun, yet challenging, game! Even my grumpy teen daughter joined in the fun! I love that we can use our own Lego's, too and even make additional games out of it.
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent suspense book.  Very hard to put down.  Kept you wondering who did it until the very end.  Hope he has more available.
B009GEPPYC|3.0|Kinda corny but it passed my time on a layover flight. Tom C looks great and the music is fun. Brings back memories.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I like the variety in this game - different looks as you progress through the levels.  It's a fun, brainteaser style of game.  If you enjoy problem solving, puzzles, physics (yep, physics can be fun!) then you should give this game a try.
B0036OS3ME|5.0|We have received quite a bit of snow so far this year.. they are warm, water proof and stylish enough to wear at my job. I love them.
B008D28HYS|4.0|The only reason I took one star off of this game was that I am using my phone, a Droid X, to play this game.  The phone screen is sufficient for the easier levels, but now that I'm in the harder versions, it's a bit challenging to work within the small confines of my screen.  It really makes me want to get a tablet as I absolutely love this game!  If you like logic games, puzzles, or even crosswords, this would be a good game for you!
B007SGM084|3.0|I found this trilogy very interesting--at times captivating. However, the series lacked in substantive writing. I found myself wanting to email the writer a thesaurus. If you are looking for a quick read and an escape from reality, this set is for you. If you find yourself constantly editing grammar, word choice, and basic sentence structure, move on.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This book is better than the last few Patricia Cornwell has written, however I don't think she is quite back yet.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Our grandson loves the books and when he sees the books come to life in a movie it thrills him.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This only shows a few postings from people and then nothing. Very unhappy with it. Someone needs to fix it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing app. so many games. addictive. I can play for hours. best entertainment app ive ever used. a must have.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I ordered this as a  Christmas gift.  She loved it.  She has already watched it several times.  Great quality.  Would recommend highly.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Bought on vacation for my grandchildren.. They watched more times than I care to count.  Kept them occupied while we cooked.  Best purchase of Christmas vacation.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I ordered this as a  Christmas gift.  She loved it.  She has already watched it several times.  Great quality.  Would recommend highly.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|I got the DVD to replace my wore out VHS tape. I watched it as a kid. I watched it with my kids. Now, I'm ready to watch it with my grandkid. Fun!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Wonderful. Have played it for my friends and I am sure they will be buying it too.  Really  good music.
B0063GORYU|1.0|It didn't work work on my netbook, because of low resolutions.Not your fault / and but there sometime night word
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you need a good laugh for ADULTS ONLY get this! very funny~~ Its worth a great long hard LAUGH!!!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I like this movie as it reminds me of the spirit of Santa Claus.  And my beautiful niece Taylar, s a Natalie Wood look a like.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this ap. It's easy to use and navigate to my boards as well as others. perfect for using on my kindle!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great to keep an eye on the sky and stay prepared for storms, but ready to roll on nice days!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This wasn't a great movie but was worth the watch. Plenty of action in this remake. I decided to rent this movie rather than buy because I knew it wasn't a \\"keeper\\". Worth the $3.99 and will keep you entertained for the 2 hours. Just don't expect a fantastic movie, because it wasn't. :-)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is going to leave you in suspense it would make my heart stop. you could practically visualize everything that is going on in the book. It's so vividly detailed. And the relationships between everyone is spectacular. Some begin to trust and some become better friends. You are going to love this book.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|He loved it. It was a great price for a great series. It is coming to great use and he couldn't be happier.
B008J05EL8|1.0|you need to buy another more expensive app to use this app....it was not full explained before i purchased it....i have no need for this app...really see no need for MOST people to ever buy this app...a pop up appeared on my kindle saying i needed this app...but i really did not need it at all....
B0072OFOM6|5.0|rapida entrega de parte de la tienda muy buena serie me encant&oacute;, espero la proxima temporada lo mas pronto posible
B00004Y6NU|4.0|One star off because the product took too long to arrive and the CD cover was cracked. CD works fine though. Price was excellent.
0316017930|4.0|I got this book for a class.  I really enjoyed it and I ended up getting Malcolm Gladwell's other 2 books.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The misremembered Man : Love the plot and how it was brought together at the end.  Sad that so much of the torture of this story was true
145210655X|5.0|My son loves everything Star Wars, so when I saw this I had to pick it up for him for Christmas. Then I went to wrap it, flipped through it, and read it myself! It is a very quick little read. This is a great book for ALL ages, great coffee table book, bathroom reader, etc., It was actually hilarious, there my two kids are, six and thirteen, xmas morning, opening presents. Xavier opens this the same time his sister opens her Little Critter book. Both pause.literally pause with presents before them, to stop and read their new books! It makes a writer proud! Xavier finished his book before he opened another gift, yes, that's how good, how cute, how absolutely hilarious this short reader is! My son was more worried about finishing this than opening presents xmas morning, and I more worried to read it than to wrap them! Lol his sister, not quite as patient. Highly recommended to all!
B004T4LUPW|3.0|I've found it hard to find calendars that consistently sync, but this product not only syncs well, but offers tons of customizable options for syncing with multiple calendars.<br /><br />The one thing that kept this product from getting 5 stars was the color scheme. I tried adjusting all the color settings, but even so, whenever I go to create a new event and set the Start/End time, the numbers in the Set Time window are black and so is the background. This makes it almost impossible to read the time you're setting for an event (which is possibly the most important aspect of a calendar). This product would get five stars if the font in the 'Set Time' window was simply set to a color that was easier to see against the black background.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Words I never thought I'd speak, err, type. The only app I have yet to buy (okay,I seriously just upgraded my phone about two weeks ago as my xmas present to myself). Until I saw one of my favorite board games if all times, I swore I'd only download free apps, and it's an oath I kept, until Carcassone!<br /><br />So, what I love about this app is that you can play with up to five computer players or human players, me and my son played a game one night. However, if you're playing a two player human game, it can get a bit confusing and is slower than one vs AI. But I do love the automatic scorekeeping, tile sneak peeking, and how it exes out unusable places once those tiles are no longer in game.<br /><br />I also like that it has River expansion, but would love to see more expansions in the future! Princess and the Dragon anyone? And I know someone already commented on this, but I must agree tenfold, I would love love love online play!<br /><br />All in all though, this is a great game! If you love the board game version, you'll love the app. It's a great way to be able to finally play by yourself when everybody else refuses to play it with you anymore after you keep whooping them! Five stars!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I all kinds of movies but why this gotta be 3 hrs long for? I mean could u not fit the same in a 2 hr long movie?
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Very helpful for finding external Wi-Fi availabilities. I particularly enjoy the simplicity and clean design. The logo is really neat as well.
B009POCG2C|5.0|My husband is a Clint Eastwood fan. He got this for a Christmas present and watched it right away. It was a good/different story line. Drama, romance and comedy. I heard Clint Eastwood was retiring an then he saw this script and decided to not only direct but to act as the main lead. I cant picture anyone else playing the lead in this movie. Eastwood did a great job if not a little stereotypical for himself.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Beautifully done. Lots of weapon choices. Appropriately challenging. I was lucky to snag it free for my Kindle and I'm very glad I did!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is great! It's way better than the movie. This would be a book I read over and over.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This is one that will definitely keep your attention much longer than a typical I-spy sort of game.  Great graphics! Too bad its not the full game.
B008JEJP5A|1.0|I was very happy to find this album for a relatively cheap price and got it before the expected shipping date. My dissapointment was so big when I opened the package I realized the vinyl jacket was very damaged, same as the inner sleeve. I made sure to buy it new exactly to avoid this type of problems.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This is a very amusing movie. For 15 and over but very realistic. A must see. I have watched it several times now. Good every time.
B00A757EFW|2.0|i didn't realize that this wasn't a complete download. why even bother? i will keep looking for another pacman game.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Every family should make their kids 13 and over watch this. Shows hat drugs can do to mess up a person and family. The acting is awesome and it's a true story with a great ending
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This book was not my usual choice - had to read it for my book<br />Club. Am I ever glad - what a terrific story and good writing.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Not really for Kids. Don't know what Disney was thinking making this. Too scary for children.<br />Condition of DV was NEW.
B0035FQ1UU|3.0|A little far fetched and many things didn't add up but it was okay.<br />It was suspenseful but they were gaps.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|If you like Jack Johnson, more of the same. He has a great style, layed back and smoothe, easy to listen and chill to.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp saves the world again.  I know we have people out there like him we never get to acknowledge.  Thank you Vince Flynn for taking us behind the scenes of the clandestine world of heroes who surreptitiously protect us.  Looking forward to the next adventure.
B009329Y30|4.0|Romantic, fun, non-violent. Very good acting. Shows just what happens to some solders who return from active duty, the problems that many share.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|My primarily home audio system runs linux, and I couldn't be happier with this audio interface.<br />I just disabled my on-board sound and then this device was auto-detected and started working great.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I came from having an old Athlon dual core to this, and the speed difference is insane! I have it overclocked to 4.5 Ghz with a hyper 212 evo and this thing is screaming fast! Best processor for the money, in my opinion.
B005ZO4TOO|5.0|This book is amazing. It will take you 4 or 5 times looking at it before you find everything, and even then I'm not sure.Each page is a wonderful pop up plus the story is included in a small booklet on each page.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|great film by Woody Allen.  Well written and acted. The actor who played Hemmingway was brilliant. Owen Wilson was truly outstanding.
B00A4CHZ2K|2.0|The only song I recognized was &#34;Home.&#34;  It was also the only song that had any melody to amount to anything.  Every other song on the album sounds so much like all of the others that it gets monotonous.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|Clarity of content. Received a Kindle w/o camera or HD. Fortunately item was defective.  I explored the features in the HD<br />and found it to be the better product.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|The shuttle is beautifully designed.  My son loved putting it together and did so with very little help.  Caution - it is a bit fragile but completely worth it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book and the series. Brilliant love story with a little ting to it. I couldn't put it down!!! Wish there was a fourth book!! I now want a Christian Grey! <3333
B003Y5H57E|5.0|I love this movie because of the theme and how wonderful all of the performances were; even the children..especially Jonah Bobo.<br />What made me want to add it to my library was how well the story was told. I think Dan Folgelman is a great screenwriter. I recently read that what he originally wrote is what we see on the screen. Good study guide for screenwriters like myself.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|THIS IS (IF NOONE HAS CAUGHT ON) THE PREQUEAL TO ALIEN.....<br />IT WAS OKAY, BUT JUST DIDN'T HAVE KNOWN ACTORS/ACTRESS'S.  THE CAST DID SEEM TO FIT THEIR PARTS, BUT THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING MISSING.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I love her voice, and was enticed by the eye candy pic.  Never had heard an entire album by Ms Krall.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put my kindle down. I felt like I could connect with the characters. Great job Mira Lynn Kelly and than you for offering this beautifully constructed book for free. I look forward to reading more of your books.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I buy anything that Van Morrison puts out.  And this was welcomed.  Listened to it on Christmas Day driving to grandma's house.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|College Hoover does it again! She is definitely one of my favorite authors and always touches my heart with her stories! Hopeless was a book you just can't put down!! Love holder and sky is such a strong beautiful character! Can't wait for the next book by this brilliant author!!!!
1595827684|5.0|This book is a must to have for an Mass Effect super fan because it come with a bunch of good art, nice draws, excellent art concept and a lot of stuff that you will like to see many times.<br />Thanks.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Outstanding storyline, but I found the writing style too simplistic. Haunting, yet redemptive. Glad I read it, but I will likely not reread.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This is a whole new look to this famous fictional characters, and I think the film is first rate. By not trying to make an exact copy previous films, they have reinvigorated the franchise. I enjoyed every part of this film, the sets, costumes, camera work, acting, direction, music and pace. Even the end credits were done with great imagination. Excellent piece of work.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Haven't watched in 3d yet, but we all loved it at the movies, don't know what was up with Megan Fox picking Cowboys and Aliens over this movie. Even though it was a good movie it just didn't have that iconic childhood following to be a blockbuster. This is a must have in your collection.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I think it's brilliantly done. Everything works. A great follow-up to the first movie and I believe it to be even better. I look forward to the next installment.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love keeping up with friends and family. Being able to post videos and pictures is the greatest thing ever invented.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Movie came on time. Love this movie great for the whole family. It's define tell going into our Christmas movie collection.
0061906220|5.0|My grandson loves Pete the Cat. I have my own copy that we read together when he comes to my house. So for Christmas I bought him this one and now he can read it at his house with Mommy. He loves being able to sing the song and predict what color shoes Pete will have and &#34;Does Pete cry?&#34; Goodness, No. Great book!!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I can't complain, I've been looking for a new Android game for a while and this has filled that gap. It's different and exercised your mind which I really like
143353083X|5.0|Although bigger and bulkier and harder to fit in a purse, this Bible is so worth it. I found the chapter introductions, illustrations, and footnotes to be a tremendous help to my historical and cultural naivety. The commentaries do a good job of presenting only the information necessary to contextualize the text, including the info which may not have been inferred otherwise, thus respecting the reader's own pursuit of understanding. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of this book, and of God.
0446585041|3.0|This book entertained me enough but is definately not a good book. I really do love Ellen and her personality is on every page.  But the pages have very few words on them and sometimes I think she says things just get through the book.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|i wasnt much into the first one after a while. but the angry birds space definitely topped themselves again in a new way to play and up beat!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible application is easy to use, easier than most apps.  Searching for a Bible book and verse is also easy.  It also allows the user to choose which version of the Bible he or she wants to use.<br /><br />This is an excellent application for Bible readers.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|If you want a real critique, this isn't it. I love all the Pendergast books and have a hard time finding fault. Thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down.
034580404X|5.0|I purchased the set to see what everyone was talking about.  Maybe a little over rated but at times good.
B005LAIGPU|4.0|Very interesting movie. It was a christmas gift for my 9 yr old who loved the movie. Good graphics and special effects.
B00170DEM8|3.0|Reasonable but thin on the plot. A bit plodding.  I thought that watching this movie to the end was more of a chore than a pleasure.
B001609SQA|1.0|Bandwith was totally fine on my plasma and never had issues before.  Couldn't watch any of this.  Sound not synched and 70 percent pixelated.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome game! I've played it on my iPhone and decided to put it on the Kindle for my daughter to play. Keeps your mind working but also a lot of fun.
B009A87ZKG|3.0|This Blu-Ray of Patton faithfully restores a lot of the color and saturation of the original film. Having the film natively in 1080p definitely helps retain detail that is lost having the DVD version stretched out on a 1080p panel. That being said, this really doesn't look better than the DVD version being viewed on an SD television. There's less noise than the AMC broadcasts and to a lesser extent the DVD, but really, if you exclude the opening sequence, there really isn't a lot that pops out in great detail. Is it good? Yes, but if you have an SD TV with the DVD version, don't expect anything better.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think of this game, given the name, but I decided to give it a shot and its actually pretty fun. My daughter likes to play it too.
B008KE3960|3.0|My grandson liked it because there were airplanes he could make fly and bomb tanks.  Trying to use it as a war game might be okay, but it keeps asking you to purchase &#34;extras&#34; he doesn't need at 4 years old.
B005LAII3U|2.0|This movie did have some nice visuals, but overall, not good.  Compared to the original... this is a piece of poop. I was extremely dissapointed with this remake, check out the old one it is awesome.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing the solitaire game on my new Kindle Fire.  It is easy to understand and move the cards around
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have been a SH fan since high school.  What a great price on the complete works.  Thank you for your great selection of books.
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|It wasn't a very good movie to me could have been better , prob with a different director maybe, would not recommend
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|The graphics are beautiful. I love Harry Potter and this game has a Hogwarts feel to it. Not too hard but still challenging enough!
B0066W1AZK|2.0|small graphics<br />don't know what men are being captured<br />in general it is poorly designed for a person new to chess<br />I guess you can't expect too much for free, but it did convince me not<br />to buy it, if that was a requirement to use it.<br />I seldom take the time to give reviews, but I felt that this needed an honest opinion<br />sincerely:<br />Jack Van Der Kar
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This was a great movie to kick back and have a fun night in.  Tons of action and some of my favorite ladies.
B000I9YV3A|5.0|This is a great movie showing the best and the worst natures in man. the acting was some of the best i've seen. They actually make it reality.<br />A love story, a story of loss. Acts based on fear and acts based on love. Love always wins even when it loses. 10 star movie imo. There should be a starman II(The Starman Child to man)<br />I can't express how much i loved this Movie. very moving and emotional
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've loved this game ever since 2D Boy came out with it in the Wii Shop.<br /><br />It's a great physics based game with plenty of levels and unique challenges. It's an easy concept. Use goo to create elastic like and bouncy structures. You have a starting point, and you're just trying to get to the end point (a pipe), but must collect so much goo in each level to progress. For those looking for an extra challenge, try to OCD mode, where each level sets a difficult criteria to complete it. Or, you can compete and try to build the largest tower with all of your extra Goo at the World of Goo factor (Passive competition only, not overly active. Collect extra goo balls, go back and build it a little higher and view your ranking. Repeat as needed, it doesn't actually pit you in a Tetris like competition against others).<br /><br />It's a game my four year old enjoys as well, and he loves building 'bridges and buildings'. The little engineer in him loves to figure levels out by trial and error, and is so excited when he figures out what works.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first review that Ive done...ever....thats how good this book is, there is just no way i couldnt do a review on it. I honestly was afraid to read this book at first, only because Slammed and POV were so awesome. kinda like movie sequels, they never really live up to the orginal, but boy was I wrong! And I should have known better seeing as how Colleen Hoover is an A-MAZ-ING writer, and i apologize for my doubts. Colleen has a way with telling stories and this one was stunning and I am just in awe.....
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I love it!  It's my all time favorite movie!  I will still recommend even though it has been out a while!!!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This movie screamed quirky - to such an extent that I felt it was really trying way too hard.  I usually like quirky movies, but this one just didn't do it for me.  Sort of a cross between Napoleon Dynamite and Big Fish, but it didn't work.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Ya vi todas las peliculas, simplemente un buen trabajo realizado al recopilar estas peliculas del super heroe, se las recomiendo para toda la familia...
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I loved the first two MIB's,  but this one didn't hold a candle to those.  It was slow and boring
0385344228|3.0|I found this book a little boring. I read it at first because I like mysteries, and because I knew it took place in the city I grew up in. While the story itself didn't make it hard to put down, I did read it until I had finished it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was the best book I ever read out of one thousand books I liked this book best of all
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|nice very versatile was able to use it with ease and the coloring was very bright and cheerfull colors to use.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great Christmas movie. Very funny movie. If you like Will Ferrell you will love this movie. We watch it every Xmas.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is super entertaining. Showed it to my husband and he couldn't stop playing it either. I got stuck in a few levels but not unsolvable...that's what makes it so addicting.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This is the first Follet novel I've read since \\"Eye of the needle\\".  I love historical based fiction so it was a push over.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fUN and makes you work yoit brain.  I could play It for hours. I would recommend it for kids and adults.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished this book in a weekend, it was such a page turner I couldn't put it down. Great book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the author's first book and couldn't wait to get book two. Now I'm looking forward to book three.  I'm 83 and some of the concepts were unfamiliar to me but the love story of Chrustian and Ana was thoroughly enjoyable..
B000641D2Y|5.0|Loved the movie. Was still wrapped as if I had just bought it from a store but cheaper. Thanks! s
B007SSEBCU|3.0|A decent study of Thatcher.  Meryl Streep does a great acting job.  Too bad Holywood always has to through in the typical liberal bias to everything they do.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Been waiting for tghis to get under $90 for a long time.  Noe I have time during christmas break to watch it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I needed to catch up from seasons one and two before season 3 began and this was perfect. No commercials;no interruptions. Loved every minute. The story, the acting, the costumes, the setting all are fabulous!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really enjoyed this well written story. It captures the spirit of hope and faith through religion vividly. Th e imagery given by the author makes it easily interesting.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|LOVED IT!!! It sucks you in from the beginning and you can relate to at least a little part of every character!! It also expands your mind into a different ways of thinking:-)
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Not like the original. Worth seeing this remake because it is so different from the original. The location concept is very creative.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|WOULD be awesome if the camera want upside down on the kindle fire he. Once that is fixed it  Will be a really good app
B009MCRHH6|4.0|My husband and I both love this, and thanks to the Amazon app store we got it for free! Good for people that like interactive puzzles.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I think this is the best dictionary ever !!!!!!!!!!!! You should read this cause its the best dictionary ever thank u
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good one of the best so far I wish it would have been a whole lot longer at take longer to read
B0086700CM|5.0|this game has great graphics and is incredibly addictive! It's fast moving and fun. I strongly recommend it for others.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is super fun. You can play an informed game and it is a great time passer. This game has cool graphics too. But, I only gave it four stars because Facebook sign in thingy' s kept bothering me.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I chose this rating because of the lack of detail of detail in combat.<br />Also the fact that most of the tributes whereby even named.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I was a little disappointed with the ending. As with the first two so much went into the details in the writing that it pulled you in. However, the last few chapters seemed rushed and not as detailed. Maybe it wasn't necessary but it would have been nice to have some more details regarding the evolution of the government, how their lives evolved, etc. instead of skipping ahead so quickly.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great wrap up to the trilogy and a great read.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This isn't what I was lookin for.I thought you were better then this.You better add more. Graphics like pictures and videos.
B00006EXDM|4.0|Pay attention to what years this says its through because some of their older work isnt on here still its a great album.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|It had too many f bombs and inappropriate things. Other than that it want that bad of a book. Ehhhhh.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|This is simply one the greatest books in American Lit. Aside from Slaughterhouse Five (and especially if you loved that) you want to read this book. Like all great works, it may be about a particular time, but it's truly timeless.<br />Also loved:<br />[[ASIN:B003XVYLDU Slaughterhouse-Five (Kurt Vonnegut Series)]]<br />[[ASIN:B005IHWB5C Mother Night (Kurt Vonnegut Series)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00AHQXDNS The Siege of Walter Parks]]
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book because it was really funny and it was great!!!!!!!!!!I thank Jeff Kinney for making this series.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Very easy to navigate. The study helps and cross references are just a touch away.  I love that.  Very easy to read and the text is the closest to the original.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really good game. If you liked it on your iPhone, iPod, or iPad, you'll definitely like it. It is pretty much the same game but with a lot better graphics. I love it!!!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Looking forward to the next book.first tome on kindel still trying to figure out sharing and looking.love the ease of starting back up
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|no hidden objects ...only finding tools to help solve the mystery. most rooms only have one item so pace is more relaxed than other apps. Contains an option for hints and spoilers. nice app.<br /> took me awhile in the last chapter to figure there was an instruction button to give you the goal of each puzzle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this adventurous yet daring book. I'm eager to get started with the second book to see how everything pans out for katniss and peetah.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game was engrossing and a bit challenging.  It provided good entertainment on a slow tv night between the holidays.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|i liked how there were topics everyone could relate to, also, Charlie was easy to relate to. you could really feel his emotions through the descriptions.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|easy too use. great to keep track of expenses while traveling. like the feature to easily share notes via a link.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was sad but I could also relate to it in many ways. It's like the diary of the weird kid you know. Everything was put into Charlie's perspective with these letters to his friend. It felt personal and unique.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is an amazing book! I was strung along the whole time (tip: Don't play poker and read this at the same time) and can't wait to see what's next in store for our favorite heros!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Pretty good book in my opinion. Not a fan of the ending though. Read all three and u will see.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging  but not frustrating. The tutorial guides at a nice pace. The background colors are peaceful. And music is calming.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My brother had this game on his smart phone and was then addicted immediately I downloaded it on to my kindle fire I will listen to music and play all day it's a must need app without it I would not enjoy my kindle as much as I do.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|...and just had to read the book. So far, I am loving it although I think if I had not seen the movie, I might have been put off by the odd language. It is a GREAT story.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|An interesting read. Love is a great and terrible killer in the end.  And there are many lessons to be learned from the story.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|3D and makes your mind work..... 2 ways to play...I enjoy trying to beat my own score. I recommend it.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|If the two previous books left you with questions this one has the answers and then some. I have been a huge fan of this writing team since Relic and they continue to come up with page-turners.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am playing with my 9 year old granddaughter and it is a great way to stay in touch. This is for 2 people not one, so get a drawing partner!
B00ACFL69C|1.0|I like a good dark comedy.  This movie is NOT a good dark comedy.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that said they tried to do a Tarantino film and failed. It's unpleasantness builds to a deeply unsatisfying and unremarkable ending.  I'm really quite sorry that I watched it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|My wife is a Streisand fan and I try to purchase these was soon as they become available.  She enjoys them.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|This teeny, tiny 480-piece Lego set is in an approximately 6&#34; square box, so you can only try to imagine how microscopic the pieces must be.  The price for this &#34;build your own city&#34; (for ants?) was $125, which is beyond ridiculous. My guess is that Lego is hugely taking advantage of the popular online game and most definitely taking huge advantage of its customers.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought that it was a great book. I think it is a very good story of a teenage life.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very fun and addictive game. similar to where's my water but with a different twist. great way to kill (aka waste) several hours of an Indiana snow day:-) Well-spent 99 cents.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I have purchased nearly two dozen RAM mounts in varying configurations.  I purchased this one to hold hold a mount for my eTrex GPS.  The mount clamps securely to the round handlebars of my motorcycle and it hold firmly.  It is easy to position and fits in spaces where there is not a lot of room.  It's also easily tranferrable between my two bikes.  The RAM mount accessories are the best...you absolutely cannot go wrong with RAM.  I wish I owned stock in the company.
B005NS5CX4|4.0|First album I've downloaded using the Amazon MP3 download site and it was very easy to download and implement.<br />Love this group and like their mix of songs.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Building this was almost as much fun as riding in one to the next show. Received this for Christmas and within minutes of beginning to sort the pieces, 4 old hippies (43,48,64,68) were completely engrossed in the process. Amazing detail and groovy little features all over the place. Took about 6 hours or so to slap together after about an hour of block sorting and every minute was fun. I almost laughed out loud in delight when some of the details (lava lamp, curtains, wine glass, etc..) finally came into place. The first lego set I've built in at least 30 years and probably the start of a pricey new hobby. A blast in and of itself as a toy with a ton of memories/sentimental value thrown in. Simply incredible. Make Lego models not war, indeed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked this book. Amazing storyline, amazing description. I would recommend this book to anyone, any age, any gender. Loved the movie also and found it followed the book well.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The only complaint that I have is how infrequently you get diamonds compared to how often you find yourself in need of them (some items it says can be found in other rooms never seem to appear)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book. 5 stars. I can't wait for the next one. Why end it like that though I think Kinney could have ended better
B009MF56GC|4.0|Action was good. Story was a little predictable. Thought it could have been a little more polished. Still liked the movie though
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|A great fun twist and turn book as always Sophie Kinsella makes me laugh.  I really enjoyed this story, and the characters were great.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A great sequel, however there were parts I didn't all together appreciate. A great read for followers of the underhanded trilogy
B0011Z77OK|5.0|If I could have only only album forever, this would be it.  This is my road tripping music.  Keeps me awake, alert, and feeling good to listen to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't wait for the third installment in the trilogy! Ken Follett continued the stories of the characters introduced in the first book while laying out the history of the century, now through the 2nd world war and its immediate aftermath. It was engrossing and as far as I could tell, accurate at the macro level.
B0086700CM|5.0|Graphics night not be the greatest but I like the difficulty level in that game. It is tricky and frustrating at times but pretty addicting.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is a master of this genre. The book teaches history while engrossing the reader in personal stories of fictional, yet realistic, characters. It is a large book but a page turner.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Loved the very first TRON and fell in love again with this one! The visuals are amazing, they suck you right in.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book! I was introduced to it by my 15 year old son. It is far more than a kid's book. It describes a very difficult period in European history from the ground level. It also is a story of triumph of the individual or maybe of the human spirit, overcoming trying circumstances and finding beauty.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not a bad game for this format.  Didn't like the ending.  Have to buy the sequel to find out what happens.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and I was excited when I saw this app. I've had for a year and I still play it! Yay! :D
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard is a poet, scholar and writer of songs and music.  Deep and meaningful writings.  If you like Leonard Cohen, you will like this.  Regarding the music, you can hear the Hebrew music coming through in his songs.  Recommend this for your CD library.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|JUST WATCH IT!!! ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TV TODAY! EVERY CHARACTER IS THE BEST, BUT SHELDON DOES STEAL THE SHOW!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I LOVE HAVING ACCESS TO THE WEATHER SO CONVENIENTLY.  DON'T HAVE A LOCAL WEATHER CHANNEL ON THE TV SO I LOVE HAVING THIS ON MY KINDLE.
B007SUW24W|5.0|In regards to the music itself, Ed Sheeran has a unique vocal style and lyrical ability. I highly recommend this cd. It is one of the few that I listen to without skipping past some songs.<br /><br />As always, the purchase experience with Amazon was ideal. Good price, great item, fast delivery.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a great game and it is very addicting.  Sometimes very challanging.<br />Recommend this one. Different than regular solitaire.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this app!  A very entertaining way to relax for a few minutes.  Problem free and I use this every day.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I am still learning about this game.  I think it is going to be a good one but stil not on to all the features yet.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works reliably and is very convenient! I wouldn't be without it. It is a great addition to my Kindle Fire.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The most awesome series of all times!!...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've always loved teenage romances (as I'm assuming most bored 14 year old girls do) but this one really captured  my heart. It's the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, if you know what I mean. Like, it's more than Twilight but not as graphic as 50 shades.
0790729989|5.0|Brillant!!...simply brillant
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I saw these on TV & loved them...now I can watch again whenever I want to. I bought seasoin 3 and am anxious to see that, too.
B001TODCII|5.0|Exellent movie
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I watched seasons 1 & 2 on TV and loved every minute of them. I bought those and am now anxious to watch season 3.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Esta caja de discos de vinilos es realmente genial, escuchar a los beatles en vinilos es otra cosa una experiencia unica.
0316066524|5.0|...one of the most interesting and creative works of fiction I have ever read....can promise you have never read anytihng like it...Some say is about the downsides of entertainment but  much more pertinent re addiction....Long, but if you can get to page 55 or so you will not put it down.....
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am half way through this book and am wishing it would not end. I love the characters, always have since I read everything from these writers. I am taken with the detail, the quality of what the words are able to convey and in general, the book overall. I am an amateur writer and I can only hope to ever display the talent of Preston and Child. If you enjoy great stories and mysteries read their books!!! I await the next book from them  and hope to find it soon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is incredible. With twist n turns beyond Anything you could imagine. I hope a happily ever after for Hope/Sky and Holder!!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love the diary of a wimpy kid books and I think this is one of the best ones so far.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The twists this book presents is definitely unexpected. It may have had a slow start but great ending. From the middle to the end I couldn't put it down.
B005544V6A|5.0|Excellent series one of the most enjoyable that I have watched in a long time. A must watch program, can't wait for season 3.
B00992CF6W|2.0|this game wont save what I built I sick so now I cant save it sick I have played it before and it save but know it wont it sucks
B009HEN7LY|5.0|Best one in the series! I rented on Amazon, then just bought it because I knew we would be watching it a lot!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Sound and video were off during the entire film. Nothing wrong with the film itself this was an amazon problem.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book more than Fifty Shades of Grey!!!!  Can't wait for Walking Disaster to be released!!! Great love story!!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|We wanted a set of cooking utensils that didn't bend when you used them. These are very sturdy, and are very easy to cook with. So they meet our most important criteria. What makes them truely special is the way the set down with the utensil end up off the surface. It is so nice not to have to use a spoon holder when cooking. We can just set these down right on the stove top or the counter, and they don't touch the surface. This keeps your counters/stove top from getting dirty, and it also means that your utensils stay clean when cooking. If you get a lot of food on the raised end, then they will tip over, but as long as you keep them relatively free of stuck on food while cooking, they work just as they are intended. They are wonderful cooking utensils.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Strong (wont bend when you go to use them)<br />-Heat Resistant<br />-Wont scratch non-stick coatings<br />-Unique feature to keep utensil end off the work surface<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I'm an old guy, but got this mp3 on a whim and enjoyed most of it greatly. A bit of the lyrics are childish but the music is hot and the song writing is top shelf! Allow yourself to love this.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|It takes more than special effects to create a good movie, you need a strong plot and interesting story line. This movie was lacking in both.
1609611543|4.0|Dr. Davis does far and beyond in explaining how dangerous wheat and wheat products are to our health. However, he IS a doctor and a lot of the information is above the average person's head.<br /><br />However, you gather enough to know that wheat is bad, dangerous, and poisonous. I haven't touched wheat since reading this book!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|...not nearly as good as the first three.  I found the topic of the viruses/medicine to be a bit cloudy and confusing.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics. It is also a fun game. I can't stop playing it. I love it and my kids love it too.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This bible app is great to have as it has an option to remind you to read during any busy schedule or time. I enjoy the option to change the version of text reading, which personally, plain English makes reading the bible understandable.  You Version is just for your own liking in terms of reading, following a plan, making notes and sharing scripture on social media. Great app for making bible reading easy. Would recommend this app.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I have always enjoyed Daniel Silva's books and I plan to read his next book. I just never read his earlier books.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|One of the great Christmas presents in recent years.  My husband is a huge Star Trek fan and can't wait to watch his favorite episodes (which is most of them).  So glad I bought this.
B00005QDW5|5.0|one of the best choices in buying of a C D that I have ever made I love iit alot
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Excellent product and value. Item arrived before the stated arrival date.Fast shipper. Excellent packaging. I highly recommend the product and the company. The colors and effects in this movie are stunning!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game collection ever!! my favorite game it is aldo free and entertaining I. highly. recomend this game
B006H5120E|5.0|Excellent product and value. Item arrived before the stated arrival date.Fast shipper. Excellent packaging. I highly recommend the product and the company.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|got this for my daughter-in-law to be since she is marrying my Lego obsessed son - we are thinking it might be perfect for the bridal shower or the grooms cake
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Excellent product and value. Item arrived before the stated arrival date.Fast shipper. Excellent packaging. I highly recommend the product and the company.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Super adorable book, and the intimacy is amazing! A definite must read book for those who crave some romance and can handle a sex scene or two. Enjoyed every page and had me looking for a Conner too.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|Excellent product and value. Item arrived before the stated arrival date.Fast shipper. Excellent packaging. I highly recommend the product and the company.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is so addicting.  When I'm in the mood, I play it at night.  It really gives your brain a workout on the difficult puzzle, but some of them are easy when you need to give your brain a break.  I want to eventually buy the color one.<br /><br />I've had it crash on me a few times, but not a lot.  Sometimes it gets a bit glitchy and I can't tap on the box I want, but other than that it's pretty good quality.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Pretty cool, although I still haven't figured out how to get more songs?<br />But BEWARE, it is very addictive!<br />Love it........
B003204MQS|3.0|I apparently didn't read too much into the movie's synopsis before I watched this, as I am not too fond of demon movies.  I thought it would have been more fun if it were more a ghostly, rather than a demonic presence.<br /><br />The movie was shot to make it look like a home movie, which didn't bother me.  It added to the atmosphere, which was fun.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Title says it all really. So, I need to put twenty weeks here huh? Well, it's easy, it's fun, and it's good for killing time.
0452289963|5.0|A no nonsense explanation of the &#34;truth&#34; of the way things are that can be an extremely welcome ally to anyone wishing to untangle themselves from the weight of habitual self-identity.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The story didn't seem that original to me.  Too many out there with this same theme.  Even DeMille's last book was similar to this one.
1455508977|5.0|The movie was good but the book was so much better but they always are this author is so good
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 9yr old son plays it, my 6yr old daughter & I all plays this game.  It's similar to temple run.  I thought it was really cool how they changed the character to santa for Christmas.
1401322786|5.0|This author always has such good books but this one was amazing and had me not wanting to put it down.
B000077VR3|5.0|Nicole Kidman has an amazing voice! Who knew she could sing so well! I love watching the movie over and over again. Ewan Mcgreger is also fantastic in this movie. One of the best actors of our time
B00004RF98|5.0|A very good and enjoyable movie by a very talented actor, singer and dancer, named Gene Kelly.  I recommend this and my dear mother very much enjoyed seeing this movie again :-)
B002ZG9774|5.0|This was an amzing movie!! I love musicals! Burlesque was fresh and fun and the songs were great! Christina and Char were amazing!! No one could have done a better job. Christina's profomance was absolutely flawless
B00656C6KK|5.0|About a good actress for many years in our wonderful nation. Dorris Day is a very talented singer and actress.
B000BZISTE|5.0|I sneaked in the theater when this came out, and watched it then, and have been hooked ever since. You can read the history and details on the other reviews, but this is just a fun movie to watch. The best thing, it has many, totally separate plots throughout the movie. From getting rid of Frank, the Dentist &#34;fairy' tale, Hot Lips shower exposure, and the football game of course. I watch it very often. I got this one due to the 2 disc package. I have another dvd, and vhs as well.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I saw this movie went it was first released.  I owned it on VHS, but needed the DVD. If you haven't seen this movie, and you like a very good love story along with wonderful dancing I recommend this movie.  I could relate to Jennifer Gray's character.  I felt rather plain and self conscious when I was a teenager. If I had met Patrick Swazye, and he taught me to dance I would have thought I had died and gone to heaven.  Wonderful movie. A classic.
0316212261|5.0|My daughter, a school teacher shared Souless with me and most of her good friends. We waited breathlessly for each following book release. I bought the boxed set for my 14 year old niece for Xmas. She's an avid reader and know she'll have them all read before Easter.
B000006NUW|5.0|Bought for my aunt for Christmas and the booklet brought her to tears. She was also very happy with the music
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Great series! We are following the story on dvd because I'm impatient and I like being able to watch more than one episode in a sitting. We have all of our friends and family watching this series too.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works as good as any iPhone facebook app does, making it easy to talk to friends on there while reading books on your Kindle Fire HD.
B003O86FMW|2.0|A novel concept in first book, a drag in second and a disaster in third. You better stop with first book and write your own story.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I downloaded it for the camera aspect but it is very confusing and hard to use. Waste of an app.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|need real money for to much of the good stuff<br />other wise fun time waster<br />similar to the crime city modern war type game
1596177373|5.0|My best friend loved receiving this for Christmas as she loves Tim Burton. They have tons of different photos on the cards rather than just a few repeated like most card decks do.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book, the first is still my favorite. This one delta bit long at times but ended on a good note.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Awesome movie and worth every penny. If you like head trippy movies then this is for you. I am not even a fan of Ashton Kutcher but he does an awesome job in this movie.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|We do not get HBO at home. I read these books and I love them! I was so happy to purchase the series on the kindle. It is excellent and definitely worth it!
B004UID2LC|2.0|The set up is weird, and its hard to navigate through it. They should fix the app to be more like the iPhone one.
B00973902K|5.0|Great upbeat song. It makes me want to getup and dance. Carly Rae Jepsen has an amazing voice and great talent.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I downloaded this and have played it a few times. Its neat to play on my Kindle Fire HD but it tends to get repetitive after awhile.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|This is a class product, thought out and designed by real users - top-notch in every way. Would recommend to any fan.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|I expected to not like this movie but I actually really liked it. Kept my attention the whole time and I even bought one for a friend.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|No collection is complete without bob marley legend, its a must have album for anyone that enjoys music. Ya man!
0307719774|5.0|This is a great gift for anyone as it keeps the person busy with something to do at least once a day - and for 5 years! I have never seen something like this until now and I am so excited to start it once January 1st gets here. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone! Also, the book isn't as large as most would think. Its actually quite smaller, but there is still plenty of room to answer all of the questions decently.
B006ZT47O0|3.0|I was never a big fan of Epica. They have been a \\"b list\\" symphonic metal band. Their music is ok, but rather generic, musicians mostly unskilled, generic song writing etc. The only thing that made them different is that there are only a handful of bands in the symphonic metal genre as opposed to other forms of metal. Well Epica rose past the B list with their previous album \\"Design Your Universe\\". They always had a pretty good female singer, but on that album they also hired a new guitarist that was really good. So not suprisingly, they kept him on this album.<br /><br />Now Design Your Universe still had the same old b-list \\"filler\\" songs that all sound the same, but it also had some really amazing songs too. Now the follow up album, again a few great moments, but we have a lot of generic death metal song writing, along with lyrics that don't make any sense. The keyboards are good, but generic. So you basically have two people in this band that are good: the new lead guitarist and the female singer. This leads to a great song occasionally and some moments of greatness, but they aren't enough to make up for the lack of talent of the rest of the band (and the band leader who keeps grunting and playing genetic guitar riffs that aren't exactly star material with his lame sounding set up). When the lead player actually writes some stuff and plays it starts to sound amazing. When the lead female vocalist starts to sing it sounds amazing. Then we go onto the next song and suddenly we are back to lame guitar riffs and death grunts. The album goes back and forth from rock star riffs and songs to \\"undergroun\\" amateur sounding stuff. It also goes back and forth between symphonic metal and death metal. It's like two totally different albums fused into one. While it has its moments, not quite as good as \\"Design Your Universe\\". Occasioanlly the piano and stuff sounds amazing too, but after a while I realize this guy mostly plays the same stuff in different songs as well.<br /><br />This album really reminds me a lot of Therion's early work back when they still had death metal influences and \\"b list\\" band members. There are hints of greatness and some good songs, and sometimes it sounds like they can stand with the big boys of the genre (you know Within Temptation, Therion, Nightwish etc.) but then they ruin it.<br /><br />The main man/rythem guitar/grunter Mark Jansen(and the guy with the least talent in the band) needs to take a bigger back seat and maybe they need to keep upgrading band members like they did on the previous album. Anyway, I ended up just ripping a few songs I liked off the CD and mostly tossed it aside. It was fun to listen to a few spins but nothing amazing. Not sure why the reviews are so great here. I guess with Epica being previously an \\"underground\\" band with low expectations means anytime they release something with a few good songs on it they will get rave reviews from their die hard fans.<br /><br />It's just a shame though, because this band has talent and potential but the guy who owns the band wont admit that he sucks and take a back seat in the song writing and performance and let the pros handle it. And this is the difference between Therion and Epica. Therion's owner/mainman actually is an amazing song writer. Yet despite this, he also takes a back seat and let's the other members shine. Epica's problem isn't much different from Leaves Eyes in which Liv lets her husband ruin most of her songs with his grunting and screaming even though 90% of the time it sounds like *&^%. For some reason it seems to be a common problem in this genre. Only here the guy is not only ruining it with his singing but also his song writing/guitar playing.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|it is a wonderful game because it keeps me occupied for awhile then if I get bored I just get new furniture like New doors more chairs and better food. the only thing I don't like is how mad the ccustomers get when they don't get food. how should I ccontrol it. other than that it is a wonderful game
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Free, doesn't slow down the device, seems to do it's job, recommended by computer place I buy my stuff from.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Great mystery series. Read on plane to/from Hawaii as well as when lounging on beach. Well-written for anyone who enjoys this gendre.
B007SGM084|5.0|I first bought a physical book of the first one about 5 months ago just because I was wondering why everyone talks about it. Back then, I had no idea what it's about at all, and to he honest, it was unexpectedly amazing! I'm not really into erotic but the story line is really good and I can't stop reading it. It took me 3 days to finish 3 books and I left them at home. Now I'm at school and I decided that I wanna reread them again so I bought this kindle version. Trust me, you won't be disappointed! :)
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book is a wonderful balance of beautiful descriptive writing and a gently unfolding story.<br />For me, the essential message was about the way a long-married couple can take each other for granted and miss out on all love, intimacy and friendship that they have to offer each other.  It explores the ability we all have to enlarge our world by stepping outside the norm plus it has some real humor - I loved the part when Harold's pilgrimage is taken over by the publicity machine.<br />I suspect more mature readers will relate better to the characters and the meandering pace.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Maybe not quite as good as the first one, but still a very good movie. I really enjoyed it. Iron Man is a really good actor.
B00866JL96|5.0|I love everything by Nickolas Sparks and the movie is great too! Bet you won't be able to watch this movie without crying!
B00973902K|5.0|Just what I need to get me moving.  Makes you want to have spring in your step.<br />good exercise music.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Dr. Seuss books have always been my favorite and are now my child's favorite too! This movie is great and also tells how important trees are as well!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Tablet version is good and easy to use. It is one of the better versions that is available for electronic devices.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This story is very compelling and detailed in its imagery.  Quite a tail!  I doubt the movie could be this good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is fun any time especially the orginal my favorite though i enjoy the others new ones but i love the orginal
B009WO7NQO|4.0|just purchased this for my 8.9 Kindle and the graphics are very vivid and bright..  Do wish they had more instructions for novice older players.  I had to figure out how to start the game. Also there were some black figure outlines that resembled a child's sticker page where you would affix the correct sticker to the outline.  I still do not know what that is.  It appears that I can only turn the screen to one landscape position.  The Kindle case will not &#34;hold up&#34; at a slant in the reverse position.  This is more a complaint of the case rather than the ap.  I thought the ap would adapt to all 4 rotations.  One should probably not be asked by Amazon to write a review until sufficient time has passed to use the product and discover any idiosyncrasies. Again, the vivid screen graphics are great and have you looking forward to the next game's graphics.  I find the audio annoying so I play with it turned OFF.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i enjoy looking at random pictures for fun nothing better to pass the time when nothing else to do anytime
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is amazing!!!!!!!! It shows you how pioneers lived back then so then again its educating!! Its also vveeerrrryyy FUN!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|i have not plyed it yet but my friends tell me its great so i cant say bad or good about the product
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Every song on this cd is a hit. This young lady is what music is all about. Such power! Love her to pieces!
B0086700CM|5.0|what is better then being chased by demon monkeys that you stole stuff from and are running from into a maze
B008R14YBK|5.0|I love the songs in it and its so so so so so so so so so so great yeah
B0063IH60K|5.0|it gives you something to do you you know how to play it, it can be a joy if not its boring
6305428352|5.0|Ordered for my mother - she had been looing for this movie for some time.  We received them quickly and she is thrilled to have it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i like facebook period so haveing it on the go makes it that much better i enjoyed the app and the fact i did not pay for it
B009IU6N5Y|5.0|I could watch this over and over and over. Really entertaining and fun to watch! I bought this as soon as i got my kindle!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Pretty fun read--not Grisham at his best, but a page turner.  His wit and background provide the basis for a good legal story.<br />I remain his fan.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This racing game takes me back to the '80s style video games that I grew up with. Very easy to play and enjoy. For those looking for a racing game with top-notch graphics, this probably won't be your game, but if you want a fun game that will bring back memories while passing the time, give this a shot!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Ted talks are great. Not to long but packed with the opinions, experiences and knowledge<br />of the speaker. If you are looking for something fun to do for 15 plus minutes it's great for<br />so many areas of interest!
B008458O3S|5.0|my grandson played  with it for hours it  kept gpoing up in the level of difficulty which challenged him til it got too hard
B009GED3HS|5.0|2 dollars an episode is pretty expensive but ill have to deal with it because I need to catch up on season 8
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never been so moved by a novel.  I downloaded this book after hearing about it from friends on Facebook and seeing it on so many \\"Best of 2012\\" lists.  I'm beginning to read more of John Green's novels after this amazing story.  I hope you fall in love with the characters like I have and that you are moved by their story like I was. I felt like a passenger along their journey, laughing with them and crying right beside them.  I can't recommend it to enough people.  This is even the first review I've been inspired to leave for a book I've read. Don't take my word for it, read it yourself. You won't be disappointed.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I just played through Journey and that was the most amazing gaming experience I've ever had. When I started, it was pretty cool but nothing mind blowing but you just keep going and somehow it turns into this really awesome experience. By the end, I had tears streaming down my face and I'm choking up and I'm 40 yrs old and my main game of choice is Gears of War. Absolutely amazing.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch is amazing. The movements are smooth, it's sturdy, great watch for anyone looking to begin a collection. With a small face however, looks pretty small on my wrist.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Great case, was very nice for the money. It was everything we expected and more! Nice all around case. Love the black!
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|title says it all...cute and fun. lots of different little challenges and mini games. I got it as the FAOTD but I would pay 99&cent; if need be
030758836X|4.0|I definitely found the book an entertaining read.  It was very well written and the writer does a great job with the plot.  I don't normally read thrillers but I like the way the writer approached her plot lines from the two points of view with surprises and twists a long the way.<br /><br />The readers seem to be very mixed about how the novel ended. It makes me want to re-read Jean-Paul Satre's play No Exit and think about it.  I think there is much in common with his play, given the nature of incompatible personalities who find themselves eternally bound in a personal hell.<br /><br />What kept me from giving it 5 stars:<br /><br />I did not like the characters nor found them engaging. These were not even people I could love to hate.  I stuck with the reading, but found that in the end, I didn't really care what happened to them.<br /><br />I thought there were too many f-bombs but I can understand why it was part of the novel's language.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase. It was on both of my siblings Christmas list and my mom bought it in the store for $15! It was a wonderful price and the dvd plays perfectly!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Love this movie and was able to order it at a great price a lot cheaper then at any store. Also fast delievery
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is selling for $17, in stores so I am very pleased with the price. The dvd plays with no problems.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I found just what I wanted for my daughter the day before Christmas, so I downloaded and burnt the CD in less than 20 minutes and such a good price....I am buying all my music downloads here from now on. Quality sound is great..
B003VBVQKS|5.0|Once again it's great to have more recordings of Tommy Bolin.  In my humble opinion he is the bedrock of the bands he played with.
B00AGKHALQ|3.0|I was wondering what the difference between this and the MiG box set is. I have all of the videos and the Making of .. videos on there....It came with a booklet and was told that is the same booklet that will be in this set. BTW my MiG box set rusted away and I did care for it. Being in FL it rusted anyway :(
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I thought this movie was supposed to be funny? Do not like Family Guy and now I know Seth McFarlane's humor is not too funny.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Ellen is funny as always! I finished the book in less than twenty four hours.  I could not put it down
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is not too bad for the kindle.  the weather is pretty accurate. don't even feel the need to buy the upgrade.
B0052REQLK|5.0|Listen all your life and follow your heart. Always help others and read for knowledge. Give more then you take.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|This is what I have been waiting for to come out!  I wanted to get these movies in blu ray but it is worth the wait to have the box set!
0765342294|4.0|I don't normally read scifi, but this book came highly recommended to me.  It was a good, quick read, and I'm glad I stepped out of my usual genre's for leisure reading.
B003I55BIA|4.0|When I first started reading this book I was worried I was getting myself into some typical good girl vs bad guy teenage drama...yawn. However,  that was not the case at all.<br /><br />Alex is the \\"bad boy\\", a gang member with a bad reputation from the other side of the tracks. Brittany is Miss Popular perfection being cheer captain and dating the quarterback (you see where my initial concern was born?). Both are thrown together as lab partners in chemistry and that's where the taunting, flirting, goading and fighting begins.<br /><br />The author was able to take such a cookie cutter cliche storyline and pull you in with the suspense, drama and romance which is not so typical because of her writing style and bringing such life to her characters. A slight resemblance to the romance story in the movies Grease, Outsiders or Pretty in Pink.<br /><br />I would read this again and will recommend it to others. I may even get the other two books which go with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was wonderful, \\"I live it.\\"<br />The story was very believable and well written. I definitely would recommend it to any of my friends.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The ultimate guilty pleasure!  A strategy game that redefines the genre.  You don't try to save the world, but end it.  Pretty addictive in a bizarre way.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Seriously kindle fire has let me down. I got this for Christmas yesterday and it works pretty well besides the fact that Amazon is so cheap, this for example them making you BUY yes BUY your access to your camera. Honestly paid 300 bucks for this....unfair.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|this book tears at your heart strings. Charlie gives us some thing we can all relate to yet mourn great storyline that's unpredictable very refreshing I read it in one day totally my favorite book.
B000KIPT30|2.0|I'd give this 1 and a half stars if I could. This little Amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. It is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. I can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. I have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. I can still use this, but hardly. I really don't like this.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater and the fact that it is based on a true story is pretty cool.  Tom Hardy and Shia LeBouf are great in this film.
B008M9PHWM|3.0|As a die-hard Dylan fan, I'm convinced almost everything he has ever done is just subtle satire. This album was no different. At this point in his career, he was expected to put out an another &#34;apocalyptic&#34; album. And so he did, only the album is complete jive, just like so much of his other material. But that's what he does best.<br /><br />The best written song on the album, 'Tempest' is close to Gordon Lightfoot's &#34;Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&#34;, only Gordo's is believable and much deeper. I had to laugh when Dylan sang, &#34;Leo said to Cleo&#34;. It's not believable and its satire.<br /><br />The same goes for &#34;Roll On John&#34;. It just didn't seem right. This album left me confused, but so has every Dylan album and I can't wait for his next one. I'll keep listening as long as he keeps making them.<br /><br />The vinyl records came in good condition and I'm saving them for a time when I get a better player.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is a christmas classic in our neighborhood.  It is sweet, funny, with a few mildly gross moments (of hilarity), and good for children and adults. Will Ferrell at his best.  highly recommend it.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|This season was perfectly new and wrapped!!! So glad I bought the blue ray dvd set on amazon through this buyer!
1416972250|5.0|Very  good book enjoyed  reading kept my  attention looking  forward to reading the  next one... good  goodd good  good  good
B0024FAR5W|5.0|This season was perfectly new and wrapped!!! So glad I bought the blue ray dvd set on amazon through this buyer! I'm excited to watch the first season yet again!
B000VWSI8S|5.0|I love Duke Elllington, and I usually don't love John Coltrane, but this album together is amazing. I can't get enough of it!
B008DVJMAW|5.0|If you harken back to the days when music was something felt deep inside and someone actually new how to put a song together, then you will really love this newest release from BBS. Little bit of Dixie was a great album and to follow it up with<br />The Whippoorwill is a major move forward for the boys. Putting two great studio albums back to back is no easy feat,<br />This album is a solid release with no weak spots. Climb up in your pick up, roll the windows down and remember<br />what it was like to sit back and just be taken away in good old American rock and roll southern music.<br />BBS put on a great show too and if you get a chance to see them live, do it. They'll be in Boston at the Paradise Feb 6th.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child are always good.<br /><br />Aloysius Pendergast is a great fictional Charactor and this book has arranged for even more adventures.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Nice graphics ...fast...Nice audio...wish my captured pieces were displayed...great value<br />Good fun when taking a break from reading..all rights then
B0063IH60K|1.0|This application does not allow you to use it. As soon as you tap to play a spam pops up. It blocks you from playing the game. How can a customer do anything, much less play. It's very frustrating.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|The whole time I was reading all I wanted to do was put the book down and run. I couldn't put it down though.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It was really fun. I had trouble figuring out the controls for the Kindle at first, but I eventually figured them out. I bought Minecraft for my Kindle afterwards because it of it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love cut the rope so was anxiously waiting for this game. it didn't disappoint! great graphics and great gameplay! go zeptolab!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It is slower reading than other Scarpetta novels but it is worth the read. Yes I would recommend it to any mystery readers.
B0051OJG4Q|4.0|These albums really do sound ok to me.I enjoy listening to them often.Julie certainly had a sexy voice and a way with a lyric.This set is an economical way to experience that.<br />The details of the packaging is misleading,and the covers are not really reproduced,like in the add.<br />This is still a good value.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It is like other Grisham books, it got my attention at the beginning and held it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B0060D11OU|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite of mine and my daughter is at the age where I think she would like it, and she did.  We've watched this movie multiple times since I purchased it.  It's just one of those movies that everyone enjoys watching and will always be a classic!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I chose this book on a whim..just to see what it was about....and I was completely captivated!!!  I couldn't put it down, n when I had to, I rushed to get back to it...very pleased with this book.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The writing on this show is superb.  The characters are deep and developed.  The story line is riveting and always keeps you guessing.  As I said above, best show on television!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I thought it would be a lot like vnc but no, it is way better. when I listen to music o  m  laptop it plays through my table  use to control it.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Very funny and fun to watch. A silly version of classic kid movies but for adults. My husband found it hysterical.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Clever, well written . Keeps your attention because you need to know what on earth could happen next!  Wonderful dialog.......and Richard Parker....what a tiger!?!
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|Bought this as a gift for the daughter friend of mine and she loved it as she unwrapped it and saw it!!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|A book of life where the individual's journey is the sole purpose of the story. Like life, Pi struggles with himself as much as his environment. Telling the story is a journey of the soul. The conclusion is to acknowledge that all stories are equally important to the teller, and it is important to be heard and believed. For there are always more unbelievable Stories to be told. In this sense, it is symbolic of tragic loss and unimaginable hardship, The the kind that beggars belief. The story is universal therefore it has no end.<br />As epic as the journey seems, it lends a clumsy intimacy between the reader and the inexperienced boy who must make the best of survival in a life raft far from reality.<br />He is never truly alone although his only distraction (the tiger) is what gives him the bloody minded determination to survive. So, living becomes the challenge.<br />Being a resourceful person who can find ways to solve problems, he goes about the task of simply living to tell the tail.<br />The sadness is that he never gets to say the most important goodbyes of his life, and I could truly feel the anguish in my chest.<br />This book will resonate strongly with those who have a story of how they made it through difficult times, but have never had a chance to be heard; who miss someone and never got to say everything that needed to be said.<br />Simply but colorfully written.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very though provoking and interesting, all Christans should read it.  The Doctor goes into detail about what caused his journey.
B0099114WO|1.0|With stars like Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carrell I thought this was a sure entertainment pleaser.  How wrong I was.  It was not funny.  It was not engaging.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  It is in my trash can right now.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I was looking for a cover that could also be used as a stand and this fits the bill quite nicely. 3 angles are nice as is the rotation from landscape to portrait. I would give it 5 out of 5 stars but when rotated 180 degrees for access of the charging port it becomes a crap shoot on whether it will actually turn the Fire on, and more importantly, off, (it may have something to do with the handle that is on the inside, as can be seen in one of the pictures). Other than this I would recommend this to anyone.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book was really good and way better than the movie. I liked how there was an epilogue . It's a must read.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is very good calculator.  I includes sin, cos, tan, log, pi, etc.  I like the display layout as well.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great show, I love the energy and genus thinking of Sherlock. Different and I really like the show and look forward to season 2.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|If I didn't already have this on my computer I would have spent the five dollars it normally costs. When I saw that it was offered as Amazon's daily deal I had to get it for my phone as well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best series we have ever seen.  The stories and the characters hang together and we are waiting to see Season 3.<br /><br />Jim Heldman
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|pretty good game. I especially like that you can actually control your army in battle to a certain extent. overall, good job by gameloft.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Pretty good book, easy read, pretty short though. I would recommend the book though. Its a cute love story with a good ending.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love the saga, but things get a little weird in this book.  It's still the same great writing and story, but be prepared for some bizarre twists and turns.
B004SKJTY6|3.0|I was loking forward to watching this movie but did not get around to it before it expired. I will have to rent again or maybe just buy it since I have heard it is really good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've read this trilogy several times now.  It has to be my favorite, or at least in my top three.  That's saying a lot too, as I am constantly reading during any spare I have.  It's a great story about a strong young woman.  It's got love stories, family struggles, a love triangle, adventure, conspiracy - all things that make books great rolled into an amazing story.  I cried, laughed, gasped out loud.  But beware for younger readers: there is some gore, and some gruesome parts that I don't think I would have dealt with as well if I were in junior high or so.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Not as good as those preceding it........might be time to put the wraps on.....good effects, story line.....not so much; would have been bummed to have paid movie $$$ to see it
B0081SPK0I|5.0|It's fun trying to Out Run the traffic and adversaries in the game! Great retro graphics and gameplay. So much fun playing on my SSGN2 I started searching where to insert my quarters!
B009NOVCTM|4.0|I have 40 Licks, and most everything is on that 2 CD collection, but this does have 17 or so differnt songs.  Everything is great.  I really enjoy listening, and I like the two new songs.  If you don't have one of the about 50 or 60 Greatest Hits Albums these young men have released over the years, then get this one.  Not a bad song in the bunch.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Read it in one day, couldn't put it down.  If you enjoy the plum series you will like this one too.
B009P5K4HK|4.0|I was happy to hear anything from Amy Winehouse.  Unfortunately, there is only one piece of material that I had not previously heard on other albums.  That's okay.  I really enjoyed the accompanying DVD with her performance in the remote setting.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's pretty good but the world's are small compared to the pc game.<br />Make the world's bigger and it will be 5 stars from me
0061122416|4.0|I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by this particular author. Very easy to read & fun
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This is a great movie.  I would highly recommend this to everyone.  It has a terrific cast.  I think everyone should watch this movie.
B0000026CM|5.0|Talent is talent in any language, every song is a success, the lyrics are heartfelt, and the music is that unique TOTO sound.  It's a shame I cant turn my own kids toward this music, they just dont understand true talent, and THE SEVENTH ONE is a true work of art.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was such a great ending to the  Hunger Games Trilogy! just when you thought you had figured everything out...something else happens!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|this one was the Amazon free app for the day and i'm glad i got it. very different from what i've played before but i really like. great graphics and it's actually relaxing to play.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Tells me what I need to know to survive a South Dakota winter.  Without it my travel schedules would be very precarious.
B0011Z0YFE|5.0|One of her best efforts! Music flows seamlessly into the next song so you don't have to stop dancing (just like the K-Tel disco records of the 1970s!). You need this album now!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie included so much action special effects, and then humor drama mix, also humanized the super heros.<br />I will will say Robert Downey owns iron man, only he makes it work like he does in Sherlock Holmes.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I never really know if these MP3 download apps are legal or not, but I guess it must be. Haven't done a lot of searching but found the songs I wanted. Had no problem downloading song and playing it back on my tablet.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I have noticed that not only did my kids watch this movie but my Grand kids love it and play it all the time. Small kids love this movie. If you have not ever watch this movie I feel sorry for you!
B001KR9AP8|5.0|got this one on sale for $5...can't beat that price. she is definitely progressing with each album. she is quite talented and show all those talents on this one. doesn't get much better than &#34;single ladies.&#34;
B00011D1OA|5.0|This is a all time time movie classic, rich entertainment great musical. This movie is for the true romantic type, that likes great acting with rich in music. This movie should never be remade.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I'm not sure who this movie was trying to cater to, but it worked for me.  I'd recommend you watch this if you need a laugh.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This is a classic from the very beginning to end. All Star cast great character acting. And I can go on and on about this movie.<br />If you have not seen this movie and you like science fiction, see this movie.
B000002JK4|4.0|Again, typical Robert Plant.  He is one of the BEST pioneers of good ol' Rock & Roll.&#34;  And, he still is!  I would recommend his albums to anyone, friends & family too!
1419705849|5.0|My son loves this book. He has the whole collection.  Be was very excited when he received it on Christmas Day.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|Again, typical Robert Plant.  He is one of the BEST pioneers of good ol' Rock & Roll.&#34;  And, he still is!  This album does not dissapoint.  I would recommend his albums to anyone, friends & family too!
B004EK926K|5.0|The artistic detail in this movie alone makes it a must-see.  Computer animation is AMAZING!<br />The story line is very true to the period in which it originated.<br />The only downside for me was that there are times when the accents are thick and hard to understand /interpret.<br />I added this to my annual Christmas movies watch list, (along with Polar Express)... Love it!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence is a definate icon in the music world.  I like it!  It is surlistic and entertaining.  Kind of an early 80's throwback.  I would recommend this to my friends and family too!  All of her albums are pretty great!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I have always loved this movie because of the goodness of it.  I was iffy on the color version when I purchased, but I knew one of the discs had the original black and white. I really love the color - I've seen so many details that I missed in the past. My favorite movie by far!
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah Jones is SPECIAL.  Her music is special and her sound is special too.  Great music enjoument here!  I would recommend Norah Jones to anyone, freinds & family, who like great relaxing music.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|Love Tilda, she really can't do anything wrong acting-wise.  The actor who played Kevin also definitely has potential, but the movie didn't allow him to show it - the book is incredible, incredibly hard to read and really makes you think.  Painful that I finished it right before Newtown.  Movie could have done a better job with such intense material.
B00000I07P|4.0|Typical Bon Jovi and quite enjoyable to listen to.  If you like Bon Jovi you will like this album.  I would recommend it to friends & family too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the same as all the others solitaire games. However, because playing it on my Kindle made it bigger so I've enjoyed it more.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Johns Mayer is well, Johns Mayer at his best.  I haven't heard a bad album by Mr. Mayer and this is no exception.  I would recommend John Mayers albums to everyone!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is so wonderfully written that you can feel the ups, downs, pains, and happiness all at the same time. You feel something for the characters in the book. The book is very emotional at times I wanted to cry. It was very detailed a little to much at times but overall I loved it. I can't wait to read the next one!
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Of course it's Neil Young after all.  Great music to just sit back and enjoy.  I would recommend &#34;Prairie Wind&#34; to friends & family.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|It was a really cute movie with tid bits of comedy that just the adults will get mixed in here and there.<br /><br />Would rent again.
B000301YY8|4.0|James Blunt is a bit different in sound.  I like James Blunt and I think you will too.  I have friends who like this album also.  I would recommend this album to friends & family too.
B009O2XY12|1.0|chose it because I use another bubble shooter game.  this one has silly graphics and the worst part is it asks you for money to buy more bubbles.  I deleted it after playing it once.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|One of his best ever!  Johns Mayer is well, Johns Mayer at his best.  I haven't heard a bad album by Mr. Mayer and this is no exception.  I would recommend John Mayers albums to family & freinds everywhere!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love it works like you would expect it to<br />If you don't have a good search engine worth the 99 cents
B0014I4KIK|5.0|It's Duffy, afterall.  She is great and her sound is unusual yet specific.  I would definately reccomend her album to my friends and family too!!!
0802473164|5.0|My husband is a stubborn man and usually doesnt read what I asked him to but he read this and really liked it and really tried to use the information. Its been fantastic!
0525478817|5.0|I read this book a few months ago, and purchased it as a gift for a friend. This book will have you laughing and crying at the same time! John green's best work in my opinion.
081297381X|5.0|This is by far, one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life.  Taleb ties in human evolution and the Power Rule beautifully.  Having read Barabasi's \\"Bursts\\", this is another phenomenal read which gives the reader philosophical insight and street smarts into how people operate.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I love Halestorm's first album more than this one but not by much. They did re-vamp their sound, but still have a lot of awesome hits!
B00574P9EQ|4.0|Funny movie. At times painful to watch the kids get into some of the situations, but that is what makes it funny. Very entertaining and my 6y/o laughed at a lot of the craziness.
1451627289|5.0|It's as good as Shawshank Redemption  Kept my interest. Very different for Stephen King wish he would write more like this
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Fantastic!  Hope they continue the series.<br />Disney did a great job with the Princess of Mars.<br />They should now build on this effort for future releases.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was a very funny movie .a must see if u like Pixar movies .laughed for the first fortyfive minutes .
B0081SPK0I|3.0|This game seems well done, but the lack of any meaningful in-game interaction with your opponent essentially disconnects you from any part of the gameplay except the base racing mechanics.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Got this and never would boot up. Reloaded it and still would not work. Took it off the Kindle and will be without.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|We enjoyed this movie about baseball. Don't worry if you don't like baseball. It's just a nice movie about a tomboy girl and her Dad and how each grow. The pace of the movie is good and keeps it entertaining with some nice zingers!
B005NJU8PA|1.0|This book was the biggest disappointment of any cook book purchase I ever made. Things in here no at home chef would ever use or have.
1416583432|5.0|A must for dog owners.  The only thing missing is an extra chapter for dogs to read to tell them what we're thinking.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I liked the game on gameboy and it plays the same on the kindle fire. The levels build up in difficulty as you progress. through them and it challenges. your skills.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I love to browse fb on my kindle but It only loads the first ten posts and then nothing.. :( please fix asap!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Bought it because of all of the hipe about the books, but half way through this one bought book two and three!
B001RXB4FY|5.0|Cool tunes, has a couple really good tracks on it. Drums are a bit heavy but it is Volbeat so what do you expect?
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Sad book to me, but written well.  My heart just broke for this young woman going through the terrible life this monster put her through.  A much stronger person than I could ever be.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Fire charger shot craps inside the warranty period. This and the wall plug were free replacements. Much better arrangement than the original.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I got this when I got my Kindle Fire. It is a nice case but now have a Coach e reader case so will probably sell this one at the garage sale.
B00555X8OA|1.0|I simply couldn't get into this book.  I was really hoping for something that would open my eyes or mind, but I found myself so bored by technical mumbo jumbo and difficult to relate to examples, I felt like I was reading a really boring textbook.  Do keep in mind that I read about 10% of the book, so it is entirely possible that this book picked up and had some marvelous insights.  I'll never know . . .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Bought the first one and before I could get half way through purchased the book two and three. Hard to put down read.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|it works really well and u can write yourself a message and play your own music for when it goes off! I love it and would recommend this to my friends! but one time it did not wake me up but all the other times it did!
B004QX07G4|4.0|Started the book and haven't finished it yet, hope to get back to it because I love Ellen D!  Just couldn't stay with the book and finish it...will one day.
1419707663|5.0|I gave this as a present to my nephew for Christmas. It was the only book he was excited to get.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had to have this book, bought book two and three when I was half way through book number 1. Couldn't put them down when I started them.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is the most fun game I have ever played ! Highly recommended for any age. I also got the best deal - free !
0425166805|5.0|This is the second time I've bought this book, I lost the first one. Great reading and you will enjoy letting your mind wander and ponder these things.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is better on my iPhone than on my Kindle Fire.  It is usually too cumbersome on the larger screen.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|Having been familiar with the musical prior to seeing the film, I was pretty disappointed overall. But MOSTLY because of Russell Crowe. WHO ALLOWED HIM TO SING LIKE THAT?! Ugh. I was not looking forward to Amanda Seyfried's &#34;singing&#34; either, and while my ears weren't hurting quite as much as I expected, it still wasn't great. Hugh Jackman's voice grew on me, but it took a long time for me to warm up to it; everything was in his upper register and it sounded strained. Anne did an alright job. Wish she hadn't belted everything. Well, I wish EVERYONE hadn't belted everything. Thank god for Aaron Tveit, Eddie Redmayne, and the rest of the revolutionary boys. They sounded wonderful. I'm glad I didn't pay more than $5 for this. :-\
1611761174|5.0|This is part of a trilogy.<br />Well read ,and as always..Ken Follet writes an intriguing tale.<br />I hope he continues on with good novels !
0545403359|5.0|Good book! Short and sweet. Saw the movie first, then the play (changed my life), and then read the book. The movie is the worst of the three but still isn't bad. Book comes in second, and the play was PHENOMENAL. If you haven't seen it, PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SEE IT BEFORE IT CLOSES JAN. 6!!
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I normally don't like these types of movies but this one was sooo funny! I was laughing the entire movie!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love that you can set your own music for the alarm. I wake up to my favorite song every morning.
1452110581|5.0|I laughed outloud on some of these poems, I gave it to my sister & brother-in-law for Christmas as a gag gift, and they loved reading it outloud. I liked the way Amazon let me &#34;look inside&#34; before I bought it, and I would recommend this to a cat lover friend.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Great tool for any photgrapher who is doing long exposures.  Much less expensive than on the big sites.  I would recommend.
1449410243|5.0|This book is hilarilous! Some of Oatmeal's stuff is a little gross, but I also gave this to my other sister & brother-in-law who just got a new cat, and they laughed a lot! I would recommend this to all people, those with cats and without.
B0071QIN00|5.0|This game is awesome! On level 24, the explosion could fling you out of the world. I LOVE THIS GAME!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Epic movie with an amazing cast. Wes Anderson always brings the magic.You probably wont be disappointed! :)<br /><br />Seriously, just watch it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The handful of books on the Special Forces that I have read include missions that are not relevant and include fluff.  \\"No Easy Day\\" includes only the necessities even while describing many missions outside of the main raid on Osama bin Laden.  The stories are intriguing and entertaining.  The book is very well written.  I bought two copies as Christmas gifts after reading my own.  I'd give it a 6th star if I could.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I watched it twice in the same day, I guess that says it all!<br />And it was nice to see Noomi Rapace, again, I loved her in<br />&#34;The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo,&#34; all three movies where 5<br />stars. . .
B005LAIHY0|3.0|It was a fine day for a bad movie  as movies go but thats life in the fast lane to day.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The free version worked fine, but I prefer to pay for the application that is ad free. I would recommend this application to others.
B00992CF6W|3.0|the app wont. save survival mode and wont open creative. I like the game it is just frustrating that the game wont open creative and save survivial
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|First kindle and first app so I am getting used to both at the same time.  So far really enjoying the app and having a a great time with the app.
B007MDB548|2.0|First off, my kids and I loved this movie. We now have all four Tink movies, and we will probably buy the next one as well. No violence, easy to relate to, beautiful imagery, and enough little things for both children and adults to enjoy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the quality of the discs is sub-par. I can't speak for the Blu-Ray discs, as we don't actually own a blu-ray player, but the DVD skipped seven times right out of the box. Luckily, the digital copy is perfectly fine, and the skipping itself was slight instead of jarring. But for a brand new movie to do this is completely unacceptable.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|as always, ncis rocks! enjoy getting to know the characters. they feel like family. robert wagner is a great addition.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you like scary and twisted, this is the series for you.  Very adult horror, superb acting and a terrifying storyline.
B0061S073A|5.0|just bought my 8 year old a kindle fire for Christmas and this app is perfect for protecting her from the internet. love it!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I like Taylor Smith's music and wish that I could use my Apple music app to play it vs now having to use amazons app
B004GJDQT8|5.0|very user friendly app! thrres no difference really from the full website, in fact, I think thapp is actually better.  just what I need!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. I have read it too many times to count. A must read. I love this book
B003O86FMW|5.0|I definitely lost sleep reading this book. I couldn't put it down. A truly captivating read. Don't pick it up thinking it's a bedtime story or you'll be awake far longer than is sensible.
B0091574VI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and adored Oscar the heart stealing chimp. It was not an action packed movie nor was it full of plot. It was just a movie about chimps and their ordeal to live. I actually even learned a thing or two about chimps while watching it. Families would like this movie.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|The game was download from the amazon apps store and installed without a problem.  My grandson played the game and found it to be very enjoyable.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is very addictive and a blast to play. I would recomend this game to anyone. I love it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|nice game to pass my time durning break needs an easier way to refill energy though and my friends need to play so I can pass missions
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The book kept me interested the whole time. If you were a geek in the eighties this book talks to all your favorites.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Pretty predictable as a remake but some different twists.  Effects were really good and excellent on surround.  Overall entertaining, but only a rental
0783230079|4.0|Wife loves it and wanted our own copy.<br />Good and interesting story especially for Robery Downey fans.<br />Would recommend and wife would highly recommend.
0786860707|5.0|5 stars... perfect, if you like animation this one is a must have.<br />Arrived very quick and in perfect conditions.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is definitely a 5 star package. Wife's boss is a huge Beatles fan, and he almost fainted when presented with this package.<br />Would highly recommend for any Beatles fan.
034580404X|5.0|Bought this as a gift because of all the hype of the book. So bought the trilogy and they love all 3 books. Would recommend to anyone
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. I felt every word of it in my core. I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very similar to The Art of Racing in the Rain.  I read the book and downloaded it because I may want to read it again.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This one was downloaded to give my kids a more &#34;seasonal&#34; approach to Angry Birds.  My 4-year old is frighteningly good at this and likes that she can change seasons/holidays to match the current season/holiday.
B008M36EEI|4.0|Good movie.  Very entertaining. No violence, gore, or graphic language to disrupt. Good old fashioned quality entertainment. Leaves you feeling good at the end.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Love the series as a whole, like to see the way the characters have matured over they course of the seasons.  Think we bought this one to build our collection of the series.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|When I got my kindle fire I noticed there wasn't a camera, so.I began searching for apps. This was the best app I'd found, but when I open the camera, I'm always upsides down. No matter which way I turn it I'm always upside down. I'd rather just use es explorer and open the real kindle fire camera than having to flip all my pictures. If this problem fixes in the future I will definitely be excited to use it. Just... not now.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Had been hearing for ages and ages about Angry Birds and thought to give it a try with the free app for Kindle.  IMMEDIATELY sucked in, my oldest 2 daughters (7 and 4) like to play it as a treat when school work, chores, etc. are done for the afternoon.  A little scary how good they are...
B009MCRHH6|2.0|Automatic zoom really messes up the game. Cannot figure out how to turn it off. Samsung tablet settings do not have on option???
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I really like the different, fun, features each bird has. My kids are excellent at this game and have tons of fun, even though they are not familiar with the Star Wars franchise.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I started reading the book and thought, this is going to be just another murder mystery which I will enjoy reading but will not remember after a few days. But as the story progressed and plot within a plot kept unraveling, it was impossible to put the book down. Without saying too much and giving away too much, I would like to say, you will keep thinking about the characters of this story long after you finish reading it. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery thrillers.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Our whole family loves this series.  We have watched it since it became a replacement for CBS's The Class (also funny).  Super smart and some of the more adult themes are worded in such a way that our kids are blessedly oblivious.  The fact that the theme song is super catchy is just a bonus!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's what you expect. No big bells or whistles. Wish facebook did the feed by most recent rather than top rated.
B008OP32M6|5.0|I've been building Lego sets since I was a small child. The Technic series are the most complicated and most engineered line that logo offers. This set is hands down my favorite. You basically build an RC car from Legos. It comes with a IR remote with servos and motors. It is all wheel drive and four wheel steer. You even build slip differentials with logo gears! Keep in mind you will put hours into building this set since it is one of the most advanced sets.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it comes with stickers, for the price they should have the graphics on the pieces instead. Also I have read, but haven't tried, that you can increase the speed by changing the gears.<br /><br />BTW, the pricing from Lego's website is about $80 less than the Amazon vendors.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|A fresh remake of an enduring classic character. There is nothing of the original lost in the update. A tossed salad of events which keeps the essence of Holmes and Watson alive.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I saw the tv series series first. Then decided to read the books. The books are far better than the show...and the show is one of my favorites. Highly recommend.
B0015AARJI|1.0|This controller looks legit in every way on the outside, but works terribly.  First, the battery life only lasts maybe 2 hours, versus my real controller which lasts a couple weeks.  Second, the reception is horrendous.  The controller has to be pointed directly at the ps3 for it to work.  Anything in the line of sight between the two will cause interference.  My real controller works pretty much throughout the whole house.  I finally cracked it open to look at the inside, and the parts are obviously cheap and inferior.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I got this app in order to view twitter on my tablet.  It does a good job and works very well.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Another great season for the BBT!! I have watched every single episode from start to finish, and love this season just as much as the others. Long live the Big Bang theory! haha.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This was a wonderful and interesting book and  good read I would give it a solid four in a half stars.<br />Sincerely Liam
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Interface is good. Almost like being on a pc, I use this app often, no problems with it. Would recommend.
B009GESJH2|5.0|This is like the old Kid Rock. I liked Born Free but this is the Kid Rock I'm used to.
0307744434|5.0|A wonderful tale a magicians and circus, family and a family of friends. Beautiful in its imagery and un put downable.
B009D0LBRO|3.0|The graphics are stunning and playing is very easy. If you are a hard core gamer this game is not for you. But if you want a fun cute easy game with stunning graphics to keep you occupied this is the game for you.
0375507256|5.0|A must read. Missed movie in the theaters, it can never live up to the book anyway. Transporting and philisophical.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|So much fun and it's FREE! Great way to kill some time in the waiting room at the doctors office.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I absolutely adore The Piano Guys. If you've not yet had the chance, be sure to visit their youtube page, for Christmas they've done a number of songs and you can listen to them there as well as watch the video of their arrangement.<br /><br />Now with that being said, this compilation by The Piano Guys features a great mix and mash of classical and modern music. My favorite track on this album is Beethoven's 5 Secrets which is a creative mash-up of Beethoven's 5th Symphony and One Directions Secrets. A Thousand Years is also beautiful. Honestly it's hard to find a track on this album that I do not like. I would highly suggest for anyone purchasing this CD or considering to purchase to check out some of the music video's for these tracks, \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" for example has a really COOL music video.<br /><br />Anyways, I hope you enjoy this CD, I know I certainly have.
B00A757EFW|4.0|easy to use, quick download, lots of furn,recommended for any one that has a few minutes to kill, like setting in a dr. office
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am a parent of two teenagers and I loved this! A view into the life of teens and a good read for parents.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I've loved this game for years and I'm happy to see that the game is brought to a portable format.  The game loads quickly and the interface and controls have been re-done for tablets.  It starts out easily enough and quickly ramps up in difficulty.  With tons of bonus levels after the normal ones, this is a great game that will probably keep you puzzled for hours.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The graphics are very attractive and the game play is smooth. I'm not sure what everyone is talking about with the ads at the beginning cuz the game seems to load fairly quickly for me.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|This is a fun and cute little game.  Sometimes placing the lines as accurately as you want is a bit of a pain, but it doesn't really detract from the challenge.  The rules are simple to understand and physics of the game seem very solid.  A good game.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This game was so much fun.  Graphics were really nice and the story line.  This was well worth the money. Need more like this.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|good to past the time but its nothing that great but if you need to stay busy its a good free app
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Just didn't like the book.  I've read many of her books over the years but I couldn't get through this one.  Find the dialogue tiresome.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower is a great book it related to me a lot. The boy in the book was so brave.
B00632HWOG|5.0|So easy and convenient to use! Who needs a home computer when you have a Kindle and this app? I love it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|wish Stephanie Meyers would continue to write about this amazing family. I am entranced with the whole relationship of Bella and Edward. I'd love to re read the entire saga from Edward's point of view.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The saga continues, and Matt gets the day off. Jeremy and Rachel Weisz take over the next Treadstone installment, and the next gen of black ops oops. Moves right along without stretching the story too thin....Pamela Landy shows up at the end to start the next installment? Maybe Matt and Jeremy can do a &#34;hand off&#34; version before Damon retires from action....&#34;)
076115728X|5.0|To summarize, the premise of this book is to show that making mistakes is okay--that you can turn mistakes into &#34;beautiful oops.&#34; For example, in the first few pages, a rip in a page becomes the mouth of an alligator and paint spills turn into elephants. I saw my daughter's eyes light up with a new way of looking at the world (and &#34;mistakes) when we read this book for the first time. It remains a go-to favorite, and makes for a great gift.<br /><br />Furthermore, the artwork is fantastic--it has the aura and feel of an elementary school art classroom. Watercolor, different textures, and actual photographic elements combine to make this a very visually-appealing book for all ages.<br /><br />Besides having a great concept and look, this book has unexpected and creative interactivity--The paper engineering is great--it's not just a simple flap here and there, but flaps--both paper and clear plastic--come at all angles, making it a fun challenge to find where to open them.<br /><br />Best of all, this book is very durable. Despite the multitude of flaps, which I usually expect to be torn out if kids' aren't careful, the Oops book has stood the test of my 3 year-old. All the pages and flaps are laminated or have some kind of protective coating, and the pages are several layers thick.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|A great book that made me laugh a lot a great book again from Jeff Kinney I'm looking forward to the next book!!!
B009NOVCTM|1.0|I got the single CD to cover all the vinyl I have of the Stones. Wanted a format to play the best of and this seemed to make sense. I received it for X-Mas and have been pretty disappointed in the sound quality. I have tried to play the CD on three different cd players and the tinny sound I am getting is annoying as hell at higher volume. It just doesn't come across as the classic Stones sound. It actually hurts my ears to hear these tracks....sigh.<br /><br />Did I get a bad CD?....I don't know but returning it as it is horrible. I have the Sansui G-8000 on one system and a Sansui 9090 on another. No amount of adjustment will take out the high tinny sound. Anyone else have that problem?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a good book but there were plenty ways to make it better. It was a  pretty predictable book.
B003YUBXVI|5.0|Really cool book, it was full of action and intrigue the whole way through. I thinks this bok goes in my top ten:)
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Love this book very helpful when reading because u can hold the word an this will  show definition of that word.,
B00AECDDYY|5.0|This game is quite a kick, hope to see some more levels soon? What an excellent concept in a simple but challenging game!! My hats off to the folks at Flashpoint Games and thanks for the fun!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|its solo addicting u should spool get it dude its SUPER AWESOME!!!!! I LOVE THIS APP its the best app in the history off the universe and will be for all eternity ;)
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I went to see this in the theater when it came out, and it was aweful! The sound in the theater was so bad, we left. Now I can watch it and listen to it on my home theater system, much better! Rock ON!!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This is one of my ALL TIME Favorite Shows and BluRay makes it all the better! You will love it!
B002POVIMS|5.0|La Roux has a unique voice and a distinct production that makes this album a winner!  Good stuff!  Highly recommend!
B008NB0SQO|4.0|Only one DVD release gives you the option of watching the theater version (in widescreen) or the directors cut (in full screen) -which includes the song &#34;When Love is Gone&#34;. While I understand the theatrical version did not include this song and this is considered the original movie, many of us who had it on VHS or had the other DVD got used to the &#34;When Love is Gone&#34; version and enjoyed it. Kids may not like it, but most adults do. Mind you, the sound and picture on Blu-Ray will blow you away, but I would have liked the option to watch it either with or without the cut scene. As far as I can tell, the scene is not even in the special features. I hope they will re-release this in the future with both versions for die hard fans such as myself.
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|This is a great album.  Miss Goulding has a great voice and this album has a unique sound and great production.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a very fun game.  Easy to play, yet challenging.  Good game for all ages.  I can't stop playing it!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Lots of fun the game keeps you interested as you play along.It's one of the best games I have seen for Android
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a very fun and challenging game.  It is great for all ages from young children through adults.  I have really enjoyed having it on my tablet.  I can't stop; playing it!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|the writing, the acting, the setting and costumes, it doesn't get much better.  Plus there are extra scenes that didn't make it onto the US screens.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Not much to say here except why am I being asked to write a review for an 'app'?<br /><br />Yeah, it works.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|Horrible movie.  It amazingly slow.  It had uncalled for full bush nudity, and the amount of drugs used in this movie gets really boring to watch.  The audience doesn't need to be reminded every 5 mins that they guy is an addict.  I was really disappointed in this crap movie.  This is by far the worst movie that Denzel has ever been in.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Awesome documentary about a world renown sushi chef!  One of the few restaurant in the world that has 3 Michelin rated.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|I love dinosaurs. This is my second TREX, looks so realistic. I know I'm almost 40 but since I'm getting these Dino's for my kids I want some for me too. No more cheap toys, these cost more but the quality shows.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I have three lenses so I wanted something better than what I had.  I love the fact that each lens can fit into a compartment and it has moveable pads that can be adjusted to secure it.  It has several small &#34;pockets&#34; in the center pouch. I haven't used it yet while being active so I can't comment on that but it certain keeps things organized.
B004VUP8WK|2.0|Sorry but I'm a huge morbid angel fan. I have all there Previous albums. I was very excited to have David Back as I always thought his voice was perfect for this band. I listened to this CD over & over and yes, there are a couple really great tracks. Just that's about it. Now I don't even bother to listen to it any more. I hope they come back from this.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|just fix the bloody newsfeed already. shows ten stories but wont update.<br />fix it. its 2012 how many people use facebook daily/hourly???
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome read! Finally found an erotic & classy story all in one. So far this trilogy makes me smile, giggle, gasp and frown. Feel like I'm the fly on the wall in the story.
B00000IPAX|5.0|The material of Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch had hits of their own and are both terrific albums, but Enema of the State is the album that Blink-182 is known and loved for. This album has their most known hits, such as Whats My Age Again, Aliens Exist, Mutt, and Adam's Song. If you like Blink-182 and/or punk rock buy this CD.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had so many twist & turns. Thrilling book. Very suspenseful when you think what next then go wow & how are they going to pull that off they do!
B0013O123Q|1.0|Over the top...disturbing.This movie is just too graphic...I'm sorry but no level of open mind is enough to digest the sick content of this movie
B004OU2FQE|5.0|Nelson DeMille again hits a home run with this thirlling often funny novel.  A good book for almost all ages.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Great price!  Lots of fun with a cute story line and nice graphics.  Not too short ot difficult to play.  No bugs at all on my Kindle Fire.
B004VD3YIM|2.0|worked well with 1 camera (trendnet). But after adding 1more camera the app began freezing up the kindle fire<br />requires full power down restart to unfreeze.
0385344325|5.0|Another great adventure in the life of Jack Reacher!  I have to admit that I am hooked on the series and I haven't found a bad one yet!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|i carry this around instead of the bigger sb910.  great for it's price and it's portable.  much improved over the built in camera flash because u can use bounce flash with this.
1469259192|5.0|Started a collection with the paperbacks but hope to move to hardbacks in the future!  Amazon makes it possible with both their new and used books, great service, and concern for their customers.  Thanks!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 6 & 7 yr old love this game. They say you have to be really creative to play it . They like it better than angry birds.
0385344333|5.0|Latest book by Lee Child on the Jack Reacher series.  Thumbed through it and can't wait to settle down and begin the read!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Who knew it was this simple?  Dr. Chapman's idea of the five love languages is so simple, you'll wonder why you never saw it before.  It explains so much.  One note of caution: I made the follow-up purchase of the book for men, but it is really the exact same book.  The differences are not worth the additional purchase.  So, get this one or get the one for men (if that's what will make you more comfortable), but get one of them.  Great ideas well presented.
0515142247|5.0|Looking for a good used hardback copy as I have wore out this paperback copy!  The Lee Child series of Jack Reacher can be read over and over and enjoyed each time!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun for the kids and free for me.  Easy to download and install.  Easy to play and learn.  No crashes.
0385340575|5.0|This book arrived in time for Christmas and added to my husband's collection of Jack Reacher hardback books!  Thanks for the quick service and very good product.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Being a free game, I thought I was only going to get a few levels, but I was wrong. Lots of levels and fun!
B0095R76EW|4.0|I liked it...nothing like Bridesmaids, but funny.  Lots of cameos!!  Great watch for a date night... give it a try!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Lots of frustrating fun. Addicting . Hard to put down.  Graphics  and sound are adequate but the best part... Easy to learn and understand.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|Such a great message packaged in a fun and engaging way!  Great movie to help explain the value of the natural world to children.  Very entertaining as well
B005LAIHYU|5.0|The item arrived within a few days, was in perfect condition.  I had expected this movie to be kind of campy, but it was really pretty well done.
B0030B1WBM|4.0|Love the movie!  Ya gotta have some tolerance and love of cheesy stuff to enjoy this movie, which is a fun take on a classic Suess tale.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Has many episodes and movies you can not get from Netflix. Bought it as a gift and he loves it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|If you have any interest in musicals, I highly recommend this movie and soundtrack, the acting and sets are amazing! I downloaded the MP3 version of the CD mainly because it was so cheap ($5!) and it downloads directly to my iTunes library.<br /><br />Truly awesome music.
030758836X|5.0|Just when you've figured it out, it changes.  Gillian Flynn is a genius to keep they layers straight and not lose the threads of the personalities.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|It is the first and best of nay made after it. I've always watched this black and white original enjoying every minute of it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|t's been at least 10 years since I've read any of Grisham's works. Many other reviews say this book is reminiscent of his early works and I have to agree. The reason I stopped reading his books is because they became  predictable - which is my assessment of this book. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and read it in a matter of hours.  However, by chapter 13, I had a suspicion about how this was all going to end. There were a few twists and turns that I saw coming but didn't know when or how they would be worked in. At one point, I thought I was so very wrong, but alas, I wasn't.  All in all, I enjoyed the book and would read it again.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Overexposed is sexy and fun music. You must hear these tracks. Love Maroon 5 and Adam Levine's vocals. HOT!!!! A definate must buy.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Best toy purchase ever!! ...Okay, maybe not EVER, but it's pretty freakin' cool. Besides coming early, I paid close attention to where everything was. It took some digging in an old junk drawer to find a screwdriver tiny enough (good thing I've saved it for the 11th Doctor's when that comes), but after five minutes of patience and care with the batteries it paid off.<br /><br />I have had the best time having fun with the pen (sparingly, since I want it to last), and it actually makes a decent flashlight. This was tested during Hurricane Sandy when the power went out and my flashlight went dead. I've gotten good at flipping it and catching it like the Doctor, and sometimes I stow it in my purse for days when I'm bored.<br /><br />To be honest, yes, it can get tiring after a while. But I bought it over seven months ago, and the batteries still work. The lights, the sounds - they all still work! And it's the best thing a fan of David Tennant's Doctor can have. :)<br /><br />Now, if you excuse me, I am off to run around my room with the sonic and pretend I'm having adventures with a madman in a box.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I highly recommend this game.  It's more fun and addictive than Angry Birds. Once you start, you will not want to put it down.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|We're huge Phantom of the Opera fans, having seen it on stage 3 times here in Detroit! I caught part of this 25th anniversary performance at The Royal Albert Hall on PBS and was just blown away!  When I realized I could purchase this amazing event on DVD I ordered it immediately! Not only do you have the best seats in the house watching this at home on a big screen TV and with surround sound, but you're able to take advantage of being \\"up close & personal\\" with the amazing camera work done for this very special, spectacular, lavish performance so skillfully updated & staged using the original creators like Andrew Lloyd Weber, Producer Cameron Macintosh, Gillian Lynne, etc.  Ramin Karimloo as The Phantom is terrific, Sierra Boggess as<br />as Christine is as good as Sarah Brightman, the original Christine! Hadley Fraser is dreamy as her boyfriend!<br /><br />But what I enjoyed the most was having previous \\"Phantoms\\" make singing appearances on stage, after all the current players took their bows! Colm Wilkinson, Peter Joback, John Owens-Jones, Anthony Warlow all sang with the current Phantom, while Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cameron Macintosh, Sarah Brightman & Michael Crawford watch from behind in absolute sheer bliss! I also loved the behind the scenes look at the rehearsals & back stage events! What fun!<br /><br />If you love \\"The Phantom\\" this DVD is a \\"must have\\" special delight!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like my computer better. I see more as I scroll along. I can respond to messages and accept or deny friends on computer easier.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover has an amazing ability to capture your heart and soul with her words and she has gone above and beyond with Hopeless.  I dare to say this book is perfection.<br /><br />I keep trying to find the words I need to describe this story and I come back to BEAUTIFUL, ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.  Hopeless stole my breath, my tears and ultimately my heart.<br /><br />Sky has led a sheltered life with her adoptive mother while being homeschooled and without access to technology.  She has very limited friendships and in her experience there isn't much that makes her `feel' or makes her heart skip a beat, especially when it comes to boys.<br /><br />Enter Dean Holder - or Holder - as he is known.  At first glance he gives Sky those butterfly-filled, heart-skipping moments before she even knows his name.  Those moments will forever change her life.<br /><br />Holder was not at all what I was expecting.  Yes, he had an edge and dimples (DIMPLES), he has a tattoo and a moodiness that can be a little scary, but that's not necessarily who Holder really is.  Holder is fiercely protective with a heart that will absolutely leave you breathless.<br /><br />Their journey is not a simple one however; there are heart-stopping, gut-wrenching secrets from the past that will weave a tangled web into their lives.  I have to say that this may be one of the most emotionally charged, raw books I've read.  Their story, and the issues they face, is told in such a real and yet beautifully honest way.  I understood every emotion these characters experienced.<br /><br />I've loved Colleen Hoover's writing since I read the first few pages of Slammed, but Hopeless has become one of the best books I've ever read.  Seriously, READ THIS BOOK! (and I dare you not to cry when you see pinkies hooked together)
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It wasn't what I expected to be honest. I thought there would be a bit more fighting scenes and such ( a Bourne movie staple) and he didn't fight the operator they sent after him (also a Bourne movie staple), but it was good. It was different to have a character who knew who he was and why he was there and that took some getting used to as well, but it was a good introduction to the new character. And for people who can't figure out why the movie title is The Bourne Legacy without Bourne being in the movie obviously don't know the definition of the word 'legacy'; although I don't believe they played that up at all to the level that was suggested in trailers and interviews with the actors. That was kind of a pet peeve while watching. If this was all started with Bourne (thus LEGACY) then why didn't they flesh that out a little more? Especially after hyping it as such.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I wanted a simple to do list for my Kindle and this is just what I wanted. Nothing unnecessary, just an easy way to make lists.
B000SEI230|5.0|Oh my God! I don't think I have ever cried so much while reading a book! And I knew what to expect...I saw the movie! There were sad moments, and happy ones. Times when I smiled at the sweetness. But, the tears just kept coming, whether at sad, happy, loving. or just plain ol' touching times...they just kept coming! I couldn't stop them! I thought I would have been under better control, because like I said, I thought I knew what to expect...I had seen the movie.<br />The problem was...like any other book/movie comparison, there were quite a few differences. Even so, it was still a great read, and a wonderful story by an outstanding author.<br />However, though I love Nicholas Sparks as an author and I love his novels and films, in less than 48 hours, I have read two of his novels where one of the love interests died. I'm going to look through the other books now, that I haven't read yet, and see if I can find a happy ending, in which both members of the couple, are still alive (and together), at the end of the book. I have several to choose from, since I bought them all. Enjoy!<br />As I already stated, this book is a great read.  if you are of the romantic hearted, put aside everything else for a while, and get cozy somewhere, and prepare to enjoy yourself.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This book is wonderful. Telling the story of growing up and all the joy and heartache that comes along with it. It is joyous and sad. Worth the time it takes to read it.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|First time I have played it. I liked it, it's challenging.  Some levels are really hard to figure out in one try.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|When I got the app for my Kindle I thought it would be llike the one on my phone, the difference is that you can SHARE like you would be able to do it on your phone or directly from the web site. Other that this it is okay.
B006LEHOL2|3.0|not too great but ok nothing i would recommend or keep. arrival on time good condition. sometimes i love her sometimes i don't
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy being able to access my facebook frients and  pictures without having to go to a computer to boot up and Love having the mobility without having to purchase a smartphone to do so
B008J34466|4.0|Pink is very talented. This record was well done, reflective of Pink's life's circumstances at the time. A must have in prep for her concert tour.
B00632HWOG|3.0|very accurate and convenient. However  font is  too  small  would like to have  larger font  in order to see more clearly
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I gave Mahjong Deluxe HD a high rating because it's a fun game to play and I like that it was free to download.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All three films in all their blu-ray splendor, plus special features disks for the last two films.<br />I loved it.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I liked this movie. Plus I listened to book 1 on Audible; which I liked also. I haven't read books 2 or 3 yet.
0345803485|1.0|I read all three books because I read a lot of mixed reviews about the book.  Just about every phrase seems to be repeated like 50x, and that is very annoying!  On every page, Christian and Anastasia seem to be having sex.. which I mean, is ok... but, no one wants to read the same thing over and over and over again.. its just boring... I wouldnt recommend the book...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game. really simplistic concepts to catch on to. great fun. love this game. great fun for all ages._ awesome.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Very emotional... cried, laughed, was angry.  Knew I wouldn't be disappointed, especially after having read both \\"Slammed\\" & \\"Point of Retreat\\" & loving those two books . Thank you Colleen Hoover!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app. Very useful and easy to use. I would highly recommend it to everyone.  Best part is its free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I recommend it for any woman aged 18 or more! A real page- turner, adictive! Very much like Twilight. Enjoy!
0345803485|5.0|The story is sexy, romantic, and interesting. The child abuse twist added even more drama. The trilogy is an easy read and I encourage all to read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I recommend it for any woman aged 18 or more! A real page- turner, adictive! Very much like Twilight. Enjoy!
B000JIHP88|5.0|Easy set up and my baby loves it. I do wish it had more songs to chose from, but still a good product.
B0086700CM|5.0|Have fun! This game provides an awesome way to explore a temple! Also it teaches you a lesson do not steal, every time you die:)
B004X75RK4|5.0|Awesome sweet romantic comedy. Watched it twice during my rental. Sandra did an great job portraying the role as a bitchy boss.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Let me put it this way. Purely and totally amazing. If you like anything you'll like this:) -my brother Jkhn
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This is a wonderful musical experience. I appreciate the band's creativity and the music is well worth listening to. It is great to see the band develop and experiment through time.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|More than anything else, this book has inspired me to work harder at my weight loss. That might sound odd given the title of the book, but I've come to realize that weight loss takes work. Yes there can be effortless parts to it, but in general it's through our own efforts that we eventually lose weight, and that true weight loss involves many different things, including diet and exercise, which I've never been very fond of. I haven't implemented anything in this book yet, but I plan to as part of my New Year's resolution.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Considering all the hype about the author's New York Times Best Seller status, the positive reviews, and her rise up the Amazon charts, I was expecting a lot from this book and I'm just not sure it delivered.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />The formatting of the e-book had a lot of issues (mainly with random indents and inconsistent paragraph formatting) which really distracted me. One would think a New York Times Best Seller could afford to hire a decent formatter. However, I do have to give kudos for the fact that I saw no proofreading issues.<br /><br />I CANNOT believe that a 17-year-old girl in 2012 denied internet access at home wouldn't take advantage of the fact that there is free internet at almost every cafe and library in the USA. Plus, she would have had access at school, once she went. My teens are required to use the internet at school. I don't even know why this was a plot device. I think it would have been more convincing to just make the case that Sky, subconsciously, had no desire to look into her own past for obvious reasons and leave it at that.<br /><br />The first half of the book was so boring and frustrating, I almost stopped reading. I actually closed my Kindle and said, \\"I'm done.\\" But I hate not reading a book I paid for, so I plowed on. The second half of the book is like a different book, but one I liked slightly better because stuff actually happened.<br /><br />Finally, I am so tired of the \\"He's so attractive. Lust=true love. He can treat me like utter crap\\" teen romances. Can we please stop defining love like this for our teens. I have a teenage daughter and I fear for her, honestly. I would have loved to see Sky stand up for herself and challenge Holder a LOT more on his crap. Instead, once they become romantically involved, it is like her personality gets throw out the proverbial window (Yes, that window). You know, you can be attracted to someone and not become a useless puddle of nothing.<br /><br />What I did like:<br /><br />The topic. I know a lot of people are complaining that this book is about sexual abuse of a minor, but I think, considering that at least 1 out of 5 women has experienced sexual abuse (many as minors), it is high time we read and talk about it.

B0084AXZK0|4.0|Dorian Gray realizes in the winter of his life that he has been deceived by hedonistic philosophies of Lord Henry and thereafter he succumbs to the depravity of his lifestyle.  The unadulterated pursuit of pleasure leaves every man desperately empty. Oh that Dorian would have sought the Lord Jesus who will remake a man despite his past.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I was finally able to update Adobe Reader---I had tried to install it numerous times on this computer. Finally, I did something that I hadn't done before, and it worked
B007THA4FI|4.0|JK sure is an ace storyteller, no doubt about that. Unfortunately, it was impossible to like any of these characters in a small English town; As we watch them jockey for position, lie, cheat and steal, there is much ugliness on hand. Though the pacing was such, and the plot so intriguing that I had to keep reading, it nonetheless gave me the creepy feeling of the guilty pleasure of reading sordid gossip. But at least I kept reading. Could not get far into Harry Potter at all.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the fact I can see local weather easily. When watching The Weather Channel on t.v., most of the coverage is a weather story. If there is a weather problem somewhere, that is the coverage. Anyway, I like using my Kindle Fire for weather.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was an extremely good book. One of my favorites. It kept me wanting to read more and kept me entertained the whole time.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I installed this CPU as the final piece to my total system upgrade and have been very impressed, to say the least, with the performance gains over my old Sandy Bridge i5-2390T. I can't speak for it's improved iGPU capabilities, as I am running dedicated graphics. The overclocking ability is very nice with this unlocked version and I like the fact that Intel decided to make a few (previously) optional feature more of a mainstay for this generation; WiDi (Intel Wireless Display), Virtualization, etc.<br /><br />If there was one complaint, it would be less about the processor itself and more about the included CPU cooler/heatsink. More specifically, the thermal interface material used on the first batch of IBs is widely rumored to be of poor quality. This is particularly important when overclocking and temps begin to rise as voltage is tweaked and the processor is pushed to it's limits. I didn't use the stock cooler, personally, but would have replaced the TIM with an aftermarket product like [[ASIN:B0002VFXFE Arctic Silver 5]].<br /><br />With an O.C. of 4.6GHz (100.0 BClk x 46.0 core ratio), running on a [[ASIN:B0051U7HMS Corsair H100 Liquid CPU Cooler]], my load temps have yet to reach 70C in the month I have been running this setup. Idle temps stay around 35C on core 1 and 25-30C on cores 2-4. Very impressed with the overclocking overhead and thermal performance (once a more adequate thermal solution has been implemented)!<br /><br />If you're a gamer, multi-tasker, or otherwise power-user; this is the CPU for you. In today's market, it's right at the sweet spot. For the performance, the pricetag is quite cheap. While many PC enthusiast communities will recommend you go with a [[ASIN:B004EBUXHQ 2500K]], it's really a matter of preference to me. While the tried and true Sandy Bridge CPUs have proven their ability for overclocking and solid performance, Ivy Bridge has taken that basic framework (literally using the same microarchitecture, just on a smaller shrink) and managed to nudge the bar up just a little more.<br /><br />If overclocking is not something you're looking to do with this CPU (well, first of all, just get the [[ASIN:B0087EVHTE i5-3570]].. wow, I just realized that's only 2 dollars less!), if you're energy-conscious, if you are running a setup based on integrated graphics; this has certainly got to be one of your (about) top 3 choices. Save yourself the money if you're a gamer; stay with the i5 class, i7s with hyper-threading are a waste of your money and the CPU's performance.<br /><br />Highly recommended CPU, very pleased with this purchase! Hope this helps!<br /><br />*Also, check out my list to see what else I paired with this CPU for my build! :) http://www.amazon.com/lm/R231Y84VR9R0ZD/ref=cm_pdp_lm_title_2

B00127RAJY|5.0|I like this DVD.  I bought it try to get stronger in my core and drop a few pounds after my second c-section.  With JM, you know what you're getting.  I've had it for a month now and I'm getting stronger...but I can only do it 3-4 times a week and I'm sore after every time (but less so each time).  I could barely walk the day after my first attempt!  I would recommend this to my mommy friends trying to get stronger.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I rate it five stars for its action and excitement. Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job at writing this exciting book with Katniss and Peeta trying to escape president snows evil hands.

B007SGLZP8|1.0|I usually enjoy Grisham. It's great vacation reading.  This one  simply annoyed me. I couldn't wait for it to be over!<br />He doesn't need the money , so why  put out something so sub-par?  It's a rant against the judicial system, fine, but with none of his usual humor or quirky characters....  Tedious.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie is a romp in travel in a foreign country and aging--something we're all afraid of but are all hopeful we find this hotel before it is over.  Wonderful acting and stunning location.  More of this kind of movie, please.

B009MCRHH6|4.0|A very solid game to alleviate boredom and occupy your time. It is challenging in parts, but rarely to the point that it becomes frustrating. The graphics are great and the rules are simple. Sometimes you have to figure out what the object of each level is, but they all end up being clear enough if you read the signs or take a minute to look at the big picture. Overall: very entertaining.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have seen the broadway show version of Les Miserables twice, once long ago and once at the recent 25th anniversary tour.  I find this movie to be far superior to either performance on stage. The acting is first rate.  In particular, Hugh Jackman and Anne Hatheway blew me away with their amazing performances.  Anne Hatheway's raw, courageous portrayal of Fontina was beautiful and heartwrenching.  Hugh Jackman was spot on as Jean Valjean.  Great performances from all, but the real surprise was the singing. The actors were filmed singing live, then the orchestra was added in.  Because of this, the actors did not have to try to sing loud over the orchestra to be heard.  It is much more intense and personal. My husband hates musicals, but he loves this one.  The music is wonderful and truly adds to the story of a fundamentalist-type policeman obsessed with the letter of the law versus mercy, compassion and redemption, of rich versus poor, of high-class versus low-class. This is bound to go down in history as the best version ever made of this wonderful classic tale.  I believe Victor Hugo would applaud!
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|This movie is finally a game movie done right. Everything was canon, and the acting was pretty amazing. Great work, Microsoft!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|A very rare instance where a movie takes a book I loved and doesn't ruin it. After watching the movie I watched the entire special features disc (also very well made and worth watching if you are a fan of cinema and how these massive projects come together and are made) and realized that the director and producers all loved the story too. But most importantly the author was involved in every step of the process including co-writing the script. I think as the years go by and we look at this trilogy in retrospect it will come to be regarded as an insightful masterpiece and not just a young adult epic.
0756688701|5.0|Nice product, exactly what I wanted.  The included Lightning McQueen was also nice but I don't think I will be removing him from the package.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be funny - but it is hilarious! It's a throwback to the 80's feel good teen movies. A must watch.
0978545095|5.0|This is the 2nd book of Vivain's work and in my opinion the better of the two books, in terms of print quality. Images in both books are excellent examples of Vivian's keen eye for capturing the variety of characters and styles of the decades she photographed. To me this is the spirit of &#34;street photography&#34; - a recording of the environment, style, cultural trends and scope of humankind, predominantly from the view of western society, but with a bit of more worldly views mixed in from her travels abroad.<br />Any fan of this style of photography will find something to appreciate in her work. This one should be in your collection.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Zero Day is actually my second David Baldacci book, following my initial discovery of his work in one of his later novels: The Innocent. I didn't simply read The Innocent, I devoured it. The book stands today in my eyes as the epitome of how to construct thrilling suspense in a modern-day thriller and easily one of the greatest books I've ever read. It possessed an asset which I feel many technothrillers fail to possess: characters which are both memorable and sympathetic. Possessing this helps create a deep emotional bond with the reader that helps invest them further into the book's complex plot, which in the case of The Innocent it was expertly crafted to such a degree that reading just one more chapter became like an unhealthy addiction. This was all complemented by a narrative that was so fast and superbly paced that it became almost torture to pull myself away from the pages and return to everyday life; needless to say I loved it and am praying for a sequel. Now why am I mentioning all of this in a review for Zero Day? I feel explaining my impressions of my first Baldacci book is the only method to properly illustrate my overall impressions from reading this one; simply due to the fact that Zero Day, despite sharing similar writing tropes of Baldacci's style, is a significantly different kind of novel in contrast to the aforementioned Innocent. Whereas The Innocent was an exercise in fast-paced action and thrills, Zero Day is a slower and more methodical book that takes its time in explaining its convoluted, yet none the less enthralling conspiracy tale. While it certainly doesn't hit the same high marks as its successor, it's still an excellent technothriller from an author who has risen as my favorite of the genre.<br /><br />As I said, Zero Day is a much slower book than The Innocent which may lead some to be disappointed if they're hoping for a faster paced novel. While I can recommend Zero Day to fans of the genre, I will admit that my initial impressionswere unfortunately negative. The beginning of the book certainly leaves more to be desired and is quite slow in both its character development and overall plot progression. This highlighted one of the serious pitfalls I feel many authors of technothrillers fall into when writing the more informative sections of their novels: an excessive use of political and militaristic jargon. I'm all for authors taking the time to apply a superb attention to detail in fiction-writing. It provides a keen introspective into both the author's literary vision and several insightful facts about real-life situations and events that brave men and women in uniform deal with on a day to day basis. However, there are several times in Zero Day, particularly in the beginning, where I feel Baldacci goes overboard with the amount of facts he provides to the point where it actually pulled me out of the story. The result makes the narrative grind to halt, resulting in the overall experience resembling the act of reading a textbook rather than an exciting thriller novel. I require escapism in my fictional entertainment, not an onslaught of informative lectures regarding the convoluted protocols of the United States bureaucracy. The plot also starts off slowly with a painfully large amount of time spent investigating multiple homicides. Again, I understand the realism Baldacci is attempting to administer here and I completely respect his approach. My complaints are likely once again due to my first impressions derived from the much faster The Innocent. Despite the issues with the beginning of the novel, the book's plot was captivating enough to enthrall me from beginning to end even with a few falters in the narrative's pace. Baldacci's knows how to make an excitingly paced novel and he doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />A personal issue I've had with technothrillers has been the lackluster characters the author illustrates in their novels. I write this with only the deepest respect for servicemen from not only the United States but for all the men and women in uniform from every country fighting to protect the people they care for. Yet when I read fiction I require deeper characterization than what most authors provide, which often divulges into stereotypical soldier cliché, or greatly over exaggerated cigar-chomping killing machines. Zero Day's protagonist, John Puller, fell into the former rather than the later of these two archetypes. He's an all-around likable character with a sympathetic and honorable backstory involving his family's legacy and dishonor, as well as his own selfless dedication to his country's well-being. However, this character is so textbook that he often feels more like a caricature for the perfect military specimen, or in the worst cases like an unfeeling machine. Based on my original impressions from The Innocent and my new insight from Zero Day, it seems Baldacci prefers to write protagonists that tend to open themselves to normal people who are forced into their line of work. Like the incredible character duo of Robie and Julie from The Innocent, Baldacci once again succeeds at crafting a memorable character duo comprised of Puller and Cole, the latter being a West Virginia cop pulled into a situation that's well above her usual norm. The relationship between these two is charming, going from strictly professional to personal. It was also endearing to see the stone-faced Puller come out of his armor once in a while and cherish things he normally would pass off as superfluous in his line of work.<br /><br />Overall, Zero Day is a great read for people looking for an intriguing conspiracy tale complete with some solid characterization. The book isn't without its flaws of course, I feel it could have been a little shorter in order to alleviate some it's rather glaring issues of pacing, and the painfully slow beginning could have been executed with more care. I also feel Puller's brother was severely underutilized, something that may be remedied in the sequel that has already come out. Still, the plot is engaging from start to finish and the character relationship between Cole and Puller will keep you invested even if Puller can come off feeling like the Terminator rather than a living breathing human being. As far as I'm concerned it's another winner from an incredible author.

0395389496|4.0|We love the book, of course - the pictures are beautiful, and the story is magical. No complaints there! That said, we specifically wanted the version that includes a CD with a narration of the story, as our 4-y-o daughter loves books that include a CD. In general, we liked the idea behind the CD - it includes background sound effects (train sounds and elves cheering, for example) in addition to the voice narration. However, it is read verrrrryyyyyy slowly, with lots of very long pauses between sentences and pages. It takes forever! Our daughter was getting bored and distracted by other things by about halfway through the narration - and this is not a boring story! We love reading to our kids ourselves anyway, so it certainly doesn't ruin the purchase for us - but we might choose to skip the CD from now on. :)

B002ZG99N6|3.0|Arrived in good condition. One pause for less than a second in the middle of tape. Colors could have been a little more vibrant, but overall, a good product.
B009EAO38C|5.0|These guys do an awesome job of mixing current pop songs with classical music in a subtle way. Fantastic arrangements and incredible performance.
1400049628|5.0|The illustrations are priceless. My brother loved getting this as a gift! Hopefully he'll learn a thing or two. lol
B008CPZNL6|5.0|All your news, entertainment, videos etc very easy to use.  O love flipping through when bored and finding new things to add to interest (add a p...I haven't figured how to bypass spellchecker yet)  LOVE IT for my new kindle fire!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Open this up and just have a little fun.  Do some sketching or play some tic tac toe with a friend,,,whatever you do enjoy it.
B006O3MU96|3.0|This game is ok and I had fun playing it, but I am glad it was free, it' s not something I would want to pay for.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|My ebay is important to me.  I find a lot of things on here that i purchase for gifts or personal collections.  Having it on my kindle was a great addition for me.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler is absolutely amazing. His range of talent is great. My husband and I find his work to be fresh and up to date.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a game i enjoy playing and now i can play on my kindle instead of always going to my game site on my computer.  Now i can just play this when i want to enjoy it with no chat from other players.
B009QD0MYQ|5.0|Love at first sight. If you aren't afraid of liking glam pop/rock or symphonic metal. This is the band you've been waiting for
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and he loved it.  He is so into Indiana Jones and having the complete set in blu-ray was a great gift for him.
B0033RT7RY|3.0|The gospel of Thomas and the Nag Hammadi were never written in Aramaic. They were originally produced in Greek and Coptic. Besides, the church already teaches that the Holy Spirit comes to live in the heart and the church is the body of Christ, not the buildings. So this movie is irrelevant. However, Gab Byrne does remind me of Martin Landau that is one point in it's favor. With so many bad movies and bad actors today it is good to see one who has stage presence and can read lines.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This has come in more handy than i thought it would.  Where you need batteries for a regular flashlight you dont need them for this,,,just make sure your charged up.  When my flashlight is dim or the batteries are dead i just grab my kindle and i have nice bright light .
B00701L5XS|3.0|This is a good program with good animations.  I was hoping it would have a few more knots than it does, but overall, it's pretty good.  I don't like the way the knots are organized.  I wish the knots were listed by what the knot does (like join two ropes, anchor something, adjustable knot, etc.)
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a good game with a good subject. Dragons are great. I like how you can breed different dragons and show them, but the game has little excitement. There should be some kind of battle feature. Maybe dragons could battle each other, or other players could attack your islands and your dragons would have to battle to protect it.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|2 discs were pretty scratched up and couldn't watch them but I have not watched all of them yet and will try to do so next week.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. It is a family,movie you would,love to watch with kids. Really funny. Great Christmas movie . I could definitely look at it over again
B004OO4UFY|5.0|The House That Dirt Built is a great album with a number of catchy tunes favorite being short change hero which was the song at the beginning of Borderlands 2.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Up to abt 120 games you have to click thu an ad each game. After that you have to click thru TWO ads. I'm not going to endure to see how long it takes to get up to three ads. I know somebody has to make a little money but that's absurd.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My Kids love it for their new 7&#34; tablets they got from Santa. It is a new spin on Angry Birds.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I find this book a little bit boring. Mostly of all the pictures.<br />I read this book because my brother recommend it to me.<br />I recommend this book to friend because it's a fun kid book.<br />Now most people who are doing a little bit of reading each day no by now that a good book is a good book.
B000HF6XV8|1.0|I've read this book several times and really enjoyed how the characters were introduced in the book and how they grew and developed.  This was lacking 100% in the movie.  The characters were poorly introduce so you don't learn to love the characters  The director just assumed you knew all the characters.  Also the narration of the main character is dropped which plays an important roll of how Mary develops in the book.  Most important part of the story was the history of the garden and why it was locked up.  This is so disappointing.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK AND THINK IT IS AMAZING. I CAN'T WAIT TO FINISH THE BOOK AND GET TO THE NEXT BOOK
B002V79VJ6|5.0|Daniel Craig gives Bond the missed character that was lacking after Sean Connery left. Plenty of action keeps interest for the whole movie.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I choose this causes  it wasn't the bad an it also helps a lot in lie and is very useful wen I need it .
B0086700CM|5.0|look at the title. it is very addicting. and also one of the funest games out there. I would get it.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is ok. Do not like the graphics quite as much as alot of these types of games but it is fun to play. The graphics are good and ot works well
B007TNS6JI|5.0|the game is epic I love the graphics and the way you can make your character. it is a hard game and the monsters get pretty scary but it is very fun
B0063GORYU|5.0|Have always liked playing spider solitaire and its nice to know that you can still get it on the more modern machines. I like the way you can cjustomize it to fit you. aWould recommend this product to anyone who plays spider solitaire
145210655X|5.0|A fun, good natured book. The artwork is beautiful. Each  page tells its own story but in some way relates to one of the original trilogy movies.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|If you or you kids love horses skip this ignorant movie. This sort of trash can scar a kid for life because of the lies about horse and human relationships that this movie teaches. Horse behavior is seriously misrepresented as in most Hollywood movies. Anthropomorphism of horses at it's worst. Story is ridiculous even for a cartoon much less a movie. People in the movie are realistically stupid though.
B004J64QR4|5.0|I have seen Les Miserables  twice the 25th anniversary concert brought back good memorys I would tell anybody who can't see it on stage get this video it is the net best thing
B004MYF4SS|4.0|This was my first Peter May book, but I will definitely read others that he has written.  The setting is bleak and nature is a main character.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is AWESOME....<br /><br />My kids got my hooked and now I can't stop playing it on my kindle fire
034580404X|3.0|I don't have much else to add, except that I bought this out of curiosity to see what makes a New York Times bestseller. Boy, was I disappointed!<br /><br />I actually read the first book, a couple of chapters of the second, then gave up. The writing is monotonous and repetitive, but if you can make it through all 3 books, all the power to you. I was very disappointed and disillusioned at what the US is putting at the top of it's bestsellers list. Why oh why did I buy the Trilogy?
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Very good rendition of the Christmas Carol. I don't believe it's meant for young children though, it's a bit dark and scary.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I love it a lot I think you should make lots of more diary of a wimpy kid books thanks
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When book 1 ends this is a absolute must! You have to continue right away :)<br />I've got so many interested in the story, you can't put it down.<br />I read book 1 & 2 in 5 days. Still need to read book3.
B009VB97EY|1.0|WORST movie I've seen in a long time. Ads indicate there might be some romance...nope...just 2 hours of raunchy stripping and drugs.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Did all my Christmas shopping and horse tack, anything your looking for is here!!<br />Highly recommend.<br />I'm on here everyday and it never gets boring.
B009WJ44KC|4.0|Best soundtrack since Saving Private Ryan from Williams, nice period drama work. There are a few lesser songs, but overall great purchase.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The story is awesome ! I have already got a lot of people interested in reading it just by giving them a brief highlightof the book.<br />You just have to read it!<br />I still need to read book 3
B004Y12S9W|4.0|Since this item isn't a &#34;genuine&#34; Apple accessory, it's not 100% compatible. In other words, I sometimes have to disconnect then connect again so that the iPhone recognizes it as a compatible accessory. Having to &#34;fudge&#34; it is worth the savings over buying a genuine Apple product which is probably overpriced.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My daughter got it for Christmas. She loves it !! It is a great house and a great place to store barbies too. Zippers work great on the box, and there are two sturdy handles to carry it with. This is a great way to take barbies on the go to grandparents house, etc. The box is deep too allowing a lot of storage!! Great idea and product, too cool !!
0199536228|4.0|Everyone knows the story, or at least they think they do. But as is the case with much classic literature that enters into popular consciousness, much gets lost or forgotten or shockingly misremembered (I'm looking at you, Wuthering Heights, and your freakish misinterpretation as a love story!) Stevenson's tale is both more and less than you probably recall it being, far more reliant on frames within frames in a way that makes you wonder if he wasn't a long-lost Bronte sister and with much less overt in its depictions of evil.<br /><br />There are many theories regarding the latter and the possible implications Stevenson's apparent timidity: that he was eliding obvious references to homosexuality, or possibly child prostitution, a major scandal over which happened during the time he was writing. I personally think Stevenson left Hyde's perversions deliberately opaque as a way of demonstrating the duality of nature even in his reader, for each of us supplies from some dark corner of our being suggestions as to what the infamous Hyde could have been up to, suggestions all the more disturbing for coming solely within ourselves.<br /><br />This particular edition includes several other tales that further illustrate Stevenson's fascination with duality and evil, as well as an essay, \\"A Gossip on Romance\\" that should be required reading for anyone enrolled in a creative writing MFA program. Rather than seeming extraneous, the extras add to the enjoyment of Stevenson's classic, as does the excellent introduction by Luckhurst, which makes getting to know this particular tale all over again an utter delight.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|i love this game and it is a great way to entertain myself while I am waiting at appointments or just have a little down time
0762445262|4.0|It was a lot smaller than I realized but I still enjoy displaying it around the house and the fact that it works so well it's a bonus!
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Great story - great scenery - just the eyes of the characters do not follow the action correctly!!  My kids' first full movie and they love it!!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I haven't been to a Movie Theater in over 25 years, I usually wait until a movie is released on DVD before I see it, (I don't have Cable of Dish, just good, old fashioned rabbit-ear antennae).  Now I wish that I had gone to see this in a Theater, especially in Imax form!  The story line is riveting and the special effects are amazing!  I watched all 3 Discs in the set, twice in the first week I had received them.  James Cameron sure knows how to capture an audience!  I recommend owning this movie in any form!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's an amazing series.. Best zombie, drama and action sequence yet. Nothing beats it. I grew up on zombie movies and this is the best
B0096PYUE2|5.0|If you have a flash for the camera on your Android phone, download this free app.  Perfect for looking for something in a bedroom while someone is sleeping, or searching for something under a bed.  As long as your phone is charged, it will work like a regular LED flashlight.  I've had to use it several times.  I mean, most folks have their cell phones on their person most of the time but not so with a flashlight.  I am very satisfied with this app!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I really liked the first MIB. I thought it was entertaining. I'm not a fan of Tommy Jones but I do like Will Smith and overall the movie was good. Don't expect an academy award winning performance, but it was a nice light comedy that passed the time. Sometimes you need that.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|This was requested by a grandchild, who already has the first one and wanted this on also. I have not seen it but if it is as good as the first it should be awesome.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Just as great as all the other Tom Clancy books about Jack Ryan!  He hasn't lost his touch!  Jack's son carries on his father' legacy.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Great CD! One of my all time favorites. Highly recommended for any Bob Marley or reggae fan. Can&#34;t stress that enough.
B00004XPPE|4.0|a highly suspenseful movie. one of the greatest ant war thriller ever it stars henry fonda walter matthau dan o herlihy and larry hagman with fritz weaver. as a group of military men on the verge of world war III. when a military  computer error deploys a squadron of sacc bombers to destroy moscow the american presient tries to call them back. but their sophisticed fail safe system prevents him from abourting the attack so he must convince the  soviets not to retaliate. in despereration the president offers to sacrifice an american city if his pilots succeed in their deadly mission over moscow a four star techno thriller that builds tension and suspense with every trick of the nuclear clock.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|nice work on this one. love all the battery info it provides. keep up the good work, and I look forward to more great apps from you guys
B00004TS0E|5.0|in this modern update of the beloved 1947 classic six year old susan has doubts about childhood's most enduring miracle santa claus but after meeting a speciial department store santa who's convinced he' the real thing susan is given the most precious gift of all something to belive in.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I just got the camera, so I haven't really used it alot.  I do wish the camera was reversible considering my son's LeapPad2 camera lens rotates.<br />I will say the quality of the pics I have taken are good.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I now have all the resident evil movies. i could watch resident evil all day and night none stop thank you for your fast shipping of this movie. i also llove milla jovovich she has been in a lot of movies like faces in the crowd and ultraviolet and i just found out she can sing too.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Mother looking to buy in store and agreed easier to get on-line.  Arrived sooner than expected and works wonderful.  No damage, no problems.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|If you're looking for suspense and intrigue, this book is it. Keeps you on the edge from start to finish.
B002ZG999U|4.0|One of those silly movies for a person who loves action movies with their favorite actor or actress.  Had no problems arriving on time always great service!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love this book......keeps you guessing the whole way through! John Grisham is always a great read and would recommend to anyone who likes a good suspense.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|My son and I have found others games that are more inteeresting. This app couldn't hold my 7 yr old's attention for even 10 mind.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I can't imagine the horror Ms Dugard endured in her years of captivity but her positive outlook is nothing short of inspirational. I commend her bravery to put her story into words and wish her all the best that life has to offer.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I mainly buy movies that have digital copies so that I can watch anywhere as well as at home with the family.  This movie was supposed to come with one but it uses Ultra Violet which now uses flixster so that is two accounts to create and fill your inbox with spam.  It has been almost a week and still haven't gotten it to work yet.  LAME!!!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|In general this is a splendid piece of work, largely because it embraces and integrates a huge amount of material, and gives the reader a fuller sense of the political terrain prior to Lincoln's election. Goodwin provides intriguing accounts of the lives, personalities, and political careers of the most important figures in the landscape around Lincoln and fleshes it all out in many details. If I had one qualm, it is that as I proceeded through this massive book, I became a bit impatient with Goodwin's occasional tendency to simplify, even caricature a few historical figures, especially when they are pitted against Lincoln, about whom she is reluctant to say a negative word. While the book is solidly grounded in research, at times it inclines toward hagiography. Since Lincoln's tortuous journey to greatness speaks for itself, there is no need to exaggerate it or protect him from his lesser characteristics, of which he was only too well aware.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|i was so excited to get this for my grandson now he has all 3 movies and he was glued to the tv. thanks
B00A757EFW|5.0|It is just like the original game with the exception of using your finger to guide him. It gives you the option of flicking or this other choice, but that choice can be annoying in that it has a huge image of Pac-man in the way.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|my son loved his gift. He just wished he had the booklet, too., for DragonballZ Season 5. Thanks a lot!
B000QFQE4U|5.0|This was truly an amazing movie. It was both educational and entertaining! Extremely inspirational as well. I would recommend anyone interested in Malcom X and/or the civil rights movement watch this. I am young guy and  was not always interested in history but this movie was great!
B008MEM24S|4.0|Good brother game for where's my water. Different enough to make it relevant. I actually got this game free on Xmas. Its worth the buck if you didn't.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book literally changed the way I felt about every single book I have ever read. I loved how the whole book was written in the form of letters. This book really deserves five stars for exquisite detail and writing style.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The automatic play makes it easy to just tap the card you want to play. The only bad thing is that it doesn't allow you to have the cards that can be played on the home piles to go automatically. It gives you the option of playing a winning hand or a random hand.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I lov ehaving facebook on my Kindle so I don't always have to have my computer close by to check my messages.
B000YHG72E|4.0|My husband and I watched Elf with our 6 (almost 7) and 8 year old sons, and the whole family enjoyed it! There were a few laugh-out-loud parts, and it was appropriate for kids with a little supervision. As always LOVE Will Ferrell!!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I had heard great reviews from many friends (although they were mostly from men who grunt) so I decided to give the movie a shot. While the movie had some funny moments, and it wasn't god awful, I didn't find the side-splitting moments that I heard others had experienced. As a child of the 80's, I did enjoy the pop culture references, and it was a bonus to discover that the guy who played Flash Gordon was still alive, but all in all the movie didn't live up to the hype. It didn't help that I couldn't get past the fact that the bear sounded like Peter Griffin. Glad I only spent $1.99 on the Amazon rental vs seeing it in the movies.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Being a pre baby boomer F/B needs some old guys on their staff... Good idea if you are a teenager... What the heck it's free...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is seriously addictive. before I knew it an hour had passed and I still wanted to try and beat my previous score.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love these books. I mean LOVE them. I was hooked from beginning to end.  The author is extremely talented and captures an amazing world of characters an  personalities.  This is a must read. I am a new super fan now. I must read more!!!!!!<br /><br />On a side note the FAQ at the end of the books is simply genius.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Kindle fire seems pretty good on everything accept for facebook. You only get 10 feeds. Won't let u scroll past 10
B009YP9L7U|4.0|No boring parts, caught my attention right from the start!<br />Typical romantic comedy, semi predictable. But I enjoyed the read!
0140282033|5.0|Joanne Harris combines the mystical/magical with the issues of those who march to a different drummer and often find themselves at odds with the community in which they live. All of her books have plots which make it nearly impossible to put them down. If you love chocolate it might send you on a binge. The movie from this book is one I revisit from time to time.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This was an incredible movie! SO REALISTIC! It depicts the life of our Troops and their experience in EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal)...how they suffer, the stressful issues they experience. It's probably the most real to life movie I've ever seen of Iraq. I wish the entire American viewing audience would watch this movie. Amazing attitudes and crazy courage, OUR TROOPS HAVE! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1452110581|5.0|This book will make you smile/laugh all the way through. The photos of cats and the wry humor are wonderful.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Every time I thought, \\"I know what's going to happen,\\" I was wrong! Howey provides an outstanding protagonist in Juliette. Strong female leads have always been my favorite, tho'...<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Just when you thought you had seen all the vampire movies, dark shadows comes with a new twist to the vampire story.  Johny Depp carries the movie, great plot, great movie
1419705849|4.0|I like to read the Third Wheel (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 7.  It made me laugh sometime.  I give four stars.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Its not the Avengers and its not Iron Man, but certainly better than Hulk and Captain America, although that doesnt say much.  Thor can be annoying with his arrogance, however the movie is great even with that.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I bought this paranormal activity because I thought it was a scared movie. But I do not like to hear people in the movie said \\"Godd-mn\\".  &lt;=== Respect His Holy Name: \\"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord shall not leave unpunished him who takes His name in vain\\" (Ex. 20:7)
B00APUQRPC|4.0|i have always liked clint. i think i like him even more now because he acts his age, if you get my meaning. the supporting cast was great. john goodman kinda looks like a big magnum pi with that stache.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|So pleased with this cd. Music is wonderful, it came in perfect condition really fast, and I just love the music!  Thank you...
159420411X|5.0|This book yields strategic influence, rather than tactical.  It is a bit narrow, and certainly shallow, for those experienced professionals in planning and analysis responsibilities of a larger, more operationally or geographically diversified corporation.<br /><br />That said, copies have been distributed by the CEOs to board members of large corporations, some that do have professional planning/forecasting departments.  I read it quickly, and with both a sense of interest and responsibility.<br /><br />On the subject of just forecasting, this is not a totally satisfying book, but it will be beneficial to most who must make decisions based upon the forecasts of others and/or \\"group\\" or consensus thinking.  It would be a very good continuing educational tool for those in many supervisory or management levels, those with less of a forecasting background, but for whom such responsibilities are shared at their levels.<br /><br />It is a very good five-star book for many, yielding a star or so lower dividend for those of experienced planning & decision making, and another star or so less for the experienced planning professional.  If you have the interest or the need of the subject, I'd definately recommend it. Even the highly experienced planning professional should read it, if for no other reason than to gain insight as to what influences his/her audience may be exposed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A great game with a lot to do. Very inventive and creative. Nice story line, fun characters. Hours of entertainment.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Bought this to increase free wifi signals that were just out of range. Works just like I had hoped. No more weak or lost signals in the campgrounds anymore.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|This is one of my 3 favorite holiday movies. Jim Carrey humor with the Grinch's attitude make this move a must see for both Seuss fans and great holiday family movie fans. We watch it over and over in my house every year.
B007UXSPK2|2.0|Seems like the movie was played more for laughs than the previous Mission Impossible films. Kind of a sappy ending with his wife still being alive.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app will only show a few status updates and will not let you load anymore. Works much better on my iphone.
B00966TN1Q|5.0|I have read every Michael Connelly novel: his writing style is impeccable and Harry Bosch is the best Detective character ever, flawed and bolshy as he is. The world would be a better place if he really existed. Everybody counts or nobody counts.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I wish I'd thoroughly read all of the other reviews, I would have saved myself the two bucks. What good is a camera if you can't see what you're taking a picture of? A camera is one of the few things I'd use this tablet for, other than reading Kindle books or watching a movie. Waste of money, to only be able to take a picture of yourself or do video chat, which I don't.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I liking it cause its fun and a lot of people could play it. they would have a blast but some of the levels can be very hard
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Starting the book was slow but the story picked up and was written very well. Definitely recommend after reading the first two books.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|As it says above, I'm only getting audio and no video. Another thing is that the app crashes every time I change picture quality, which is irrelevant to the current situation I'm in, by whatever. If I knew how to solve those two problems then I'd give the app 5 stars in an instant
B009H442DG|3.0|I expected a little more from the singers.  It was just ok. Maybe 2 songs were good.. the first and the last.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great weekend away with the husband read.  Some of the hottest and most inventive love scenes I have read.  I will keep this one for furture rereading
B00932H7FW|5.0|I can see why it's received so many awards.  Great writing and performances! Language and nudity content is very offensive to us but those aspects help define characters so well that I can appreciate their inclusions in the script.  It's the first series I've bought from Amazon and well worth the price for me and my wife.
B008HK3S04|3.0|Manufacturer's web site says it fits the iPad Mini.  Amazon&#34;s product description says fits only Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;  Amazon is correct.  The sleeve case is not tall enough.  The Mini is 0.3 &#34; taller than the Fire, making for an overly tight fit.  I called the maufacturer.  They said they are playing catch up to the Mini release and will have a case specifically for the Mini perhaps as early as 2/2013.<br /><br />Otherwise the case is high quality and attractive.  Large side flap makes it easier to insert/remove the tablet.
1616614609|5.0|My friends and I have a monthly Game Club. We all gather and bring several games and partake in adult beverages and get lost in board games. While Netrunner is only a two person we have adapted it to be a four player game. Overall the game has a rich background and the playing level is complicated to draw in both the beginner and the most staunch board/card gamer. The quality of  the packaging and detailed art work makes these a good buy. A bit pricy but still on my top of my list as the better games we have played.
B000W178XO|5.0|Anything Johnny Cash does deserves nothing less than a 5 star rating. He was a legend then and he still is today.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love all the Harry Potter movies, this was a great movie to end it all. The dvd came on time, bought new, excellent condition. Really enjoyed this movie and the time it was delivered to me.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Dislike this app. It does not allow you look at most of your previous posts and/ or news feeds. I get better access to FB from my iPhone.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|A great app to use and access your hotmail account.  It is no different than my desktop or laptop edition.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I think fifty shades was will readen. A love story  from beginning to end. Kind of ever woman's fantasy will most of it
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This app is a great addition to my Kindle Fire HD.  It is easy to use and has clear directions to follow.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|His song style and duets are easy to listen to.  Especially enjoy the up tempo duet with Cee Lo Green
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've never finished a book in one day before. For the most part there are no slow parts and no complicated series of relationships to keep track of. Of course this means that the characters can't really grow beyond exactly what you'd expect.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorites now!! So much heart and humor, I've really never read anything quite like it before. Read this book, and then pass it on...you'll be glad you did.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I fell in love with Percy Jackson, and now I am a fan of these! Riordan does an awesome job of making the story interesting to read, and keeps the excitement up. I will be reading the next some in a few short minutes!
B009A9EPLM|4.0|Beautiful yet haunting sound track.  Good piece to have around when you need a lift.  The score is great and tells a story
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app is great on my cell phone & I can't wait to use it on my new Kindle Fire HD!
B00632HWOG|1.0|i had to uninstall just to switch to a different email account. Yahoo is run by a bunch of third graders..<br /><br />tl;dr IT'S CRAP
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Holy freaking bubble wrappers!<br /><br />Wow, just wow. I stayed up late last night reading this book, had a nightmare (as I thought I would, I think I even heard my self screaming or crying, right before I woke up. I'm not sure) and resumed reading it before I ate my breakfast.<br /><br />I felt like I was developing OCD while I was reading it. I kid you not, I checked twice if my door was locked and made sure my bathroom window was closed, before I went to sleep last night.<br /><br />What a story. It sounded so realistic, it reminded me of an episode of Dr. Phil, that I saw few years back, with a woman telling a similar story :-S.<br />It felt like it was written from two diferent persons p.o.v. The one before, that was young as silly, doing stupid stuff, going out with friends and having fun. Nothing special, just average girl, living her life, working and having fun with her friends, meating a guy... And the one after, paranoid and scared out of her mind, seeing his face in every person that passed by her.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book you know that something happened, something that made her completely different person, but you don't know how exactely and why. As the story progressed, I started doubting if the things she was saying was true. Could it be that everything was just  in her head? I know she told that it happened, but how come her friends had a different explanation, that sounded more logical that hers?<br />I was going back and forward. One moment I believed her side of the story, and the next, I thought she was a total mental case, counting every single step up to her flat and checking things six times. I felt sorry for the Stuart.<br /><br />- Warning, there might be some spoilers -<br /><br />There was a point in the book, where it reminded me a little of the Consequences. And I thought that if I ever had to choose who to be raped by, Lee or Tony, it would have to be Tony from the Consequences and I would thank my lucky stars that hewas even an option to choose from, one of the two evils. That's how evil I think Lee was.<br /><br />- End of spoilers -<br /><br />The ending was brilliant. I couldn't quite figure it out if it was a cliffhanger and there will be a sequel coming up or if it was just authors last attempt to screw with my mind. The ending left me wondering &#34;What's next?&#34;. I realize that everything that needed to be told, was told. But the way the book ended still left me feeling like I read just half of the story...<br /><br />Amazing! It was better than I expected.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|FLASH JUMP!! Very funny and amusing..definitely a guys movie! One of those movies that I would probably watch over and over again..
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I put it on my Kids tablet because he asked. I never played it and now I am hooked. Installed easy.
B009POHHRG|5.0|I bought this when it was first published back in the day and I still love this as much as the first day I read it.
145210655X|5.0|Ok, this is brilliant!  hilarious captions and beautiful pictures make this a classic that any Star Wars fan should have for their future generation of fans :)
B004EPYZV2|4.0|If you liked the other mission impossible movies then you'll like this. Great action and special effects with a smattering of comedy.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I was so glad to buy this on line as I hate to stand in all the lines at the store!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Movie was great and everyone enjoyed it. Picture quality could have been better for \\"HD\\".  You might want to get the Blue Ray if you are watching on a large screen.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Brilliantly updated for mobile devices! It was a unique puzzle experience when it debuted, and has definitely held up with this port to android, especially with the cleaned up graphics and intuitive mechanics! Once you get used to how tile placement works, it's fast easy and fun!<br /><br />Bottom line: whether you've played it before or not, this is a must-play game that is well worth the price, no matter your age!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I used this to connect a midi keyboard (M-Audio Keystation 49) to my iPad and play the keyboards in Garage Band.  It worked perfectly.
1575666286|1.0|not the book I really needed. wanted the juicing recipe book only and do not ask for any further reviews, I have much more to do
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Great movie to watch with my teenage kids.Can't wait to see the sequel and how they will defeat the red evil girl.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|It tells a story about her life's lessons and encourages us to get on with our life too.  Inspiring to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A real page turner. I couldn't stop reading because I had to know what happened next. I can't wait to start the next book.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|This case fits the Kindle Fire well and looks nice.  When I first received it I absolutely loved it, but after awhile I noticed that there is a clear protection type coat on the case that started to peel off which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Its also hard to keep clean in the white so if I purchased again I would probably choose it in a different color but again the coating that starts to peel off after using it for a bit is definitely a turn off to look at.  It does protect the Kindle very well otherise, I have had the case almost a year now and it does its job to protect it, and the fold back flap on it to hold it upright if you want to sit on a desk, etc. does still work the way it should.  So all and all I do love the case, the fact that it does not add any bulk and protects it well.. and looks good prior to the peeling so I would still probably recommend it to a friend in a different color so the dirt doesn't show so well.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|This game is a ton of fun! The controls are easy, and I found myself losing an hour to this game immediately after downloading it. It uses tilt to steer and on-screen gas and brake pedals that are easy to reach.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is very cute, my 9yr old is watching it for the 2nd time in two days so she must like.  It also was priced very well and shipping wasn't too long so all in all I would def recommend this to a friend.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Moneyball is one of the best sports movies I've seen. A must have gift for that hard to buy for guy.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Wall-E was a perfect movie. The movie, while without much dialogue at first, still manages to get you hooked on the main character right away. I was amazed at how invested I was in the characters even without hearing them talk. The movie blended together humor and drama, but kept the movie light overall. I would say both kids and adults can certainly enjoy this movie. The animation looked great and Amazon's video on demand service was great too. The picture quality was amazing and I had no problems streaming the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet, and even to those who have seen it before.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love playing flow because makes me feel smart. I beat the levels so easily; it's 30 seconds and I'm done! I love that it completes the levels for me as long as I move in the right direction. Great brain game for me and my family. Just connect the dots !
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a can put down read all nighter :) I picked it up and just couldn't put it down till I finished it.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|my wife loves her kindle and cover. she already says it is addicting. I got it for a good price would recommend for purchase
B009LDXQGC|5.0|and more. Good compilation...bought it as soon as it was advertised and it's totally worth the wait...I totally love it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I found this game was just as fun and good as the Mahjong classic one.  This was very interesting and I enjoyed the many different mazes.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I love this show, I wish this wasn't the last season!  This show will suck you in making you want more.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story was decent enough and I enjoyed the depth of the characters, but the writing was atrocious. Despite all this I just downloaded the second book, because I can't stay away!
B000P0J09M|5.0|What can be said it's one of the best Mob movies ever made !  It's got it all ! By a copy ! Already !!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Amazing game I love it, it has the fun of raising dragons and having a zoo. Almost no game is as fun.
B004X4QW42|5.0|rich in tradition and culture, mutual respect, restraint even though powerful with rage to defeat and invites unity of all irrespective of background color or race
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Matched incantation habits sushi lunchbox unnerving unjust cocktail Uzbek prize fight conduct channel such X box  mean's Denise discuss ichor Kaif occupy ticket isn't I chat why icky idiot instruct
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|The story was the same as previous version in the 80's.  This is actually the third remake of the film.  The original film was made before they even had stereo sound.  The new FX were interesting but I liked the 80's version with Kurt Russel much better, ..it might have been because it was the first time I saw the film.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Highly recommended, just wish there was more to read!! Love how I try it's not predictable in any way, just keeps on surprising you!
B00008CMR6|5.0|All John Wayne movies are good.  I never saw this one before, Its very good, lots of action and scenery
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie is not funny at all.  This movie is not funny at all.  This movie is not funny at all.  This movie is not funny at all.  This movie is not funny at all.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This book has so much hype around it that I was a bit concerned going in. The problem for me was too much religious talk; while I appreciate Pi's outlook on religion I personally don't like to have so much reference to God in my fiction.
030759565X|4.0|I do enjoy that the author is fairly picky and that she works out of an urban kitchen.  City dwellers do not have room for a lot of appliances and I appreciate that she limits the amount of gadgets needed.  The first recipe I tried, however, had a mistake.  For coffee toffee it lists 8 tbsp of butter / 225 g / 2 sticks -- but 8 tbsp is only 1 stick of butter.  I hope this is the only error I find.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|A really wonderful Disney classic, it was sweet and funny and we really enjoyed it. I will be adding Brave to our collection
B000ZECQ08|4.0|None of the movies have closely followed the books they're based, I remember that much in reading/ watching each story, but they always &#34;look good&#34; and this movie is worth watching maybe even if you didn't read the book. The extras with this 2disc edition are good, I always buy 2 disc editions and this is definitely one you should do that with.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The graphics are incredible for a kindle Fire original version.  My 4 year old is a smartphone/tablet veteran already and enjoys playing this immensely.  Well worth the sale price.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is the 'cleaned' up version, if you want the really funny stuff, go with the unrated version.  Either way don't watch with someone who might be language sensative.
0062202081|5.0|Came with paper cover on top of the hardcover, no visible damages anywhere, book was new and had new book smell.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Easy game to play when you have just a few minutes.  I enjoy the fast paced nature of the arcade mode.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|Most amazing movie I've seen in a really long long long time! Definitely worth a watch with an amazing storyline.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Great photographic panoramas....super chase scenes. Missed that there were No kissing scenes. Film was a good ride, enjoyed it alot.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love to play minecraft. It is a great game and a lot of fun. However, the Pocket Edition is not the same as the internet version. It is harder to control and slightly more confusing. It is less detailed and instead of eating food to fill up the little meat things, you fill up hearts. Minecraft Pocket Edition might be more fun if you use a keyboard with it, but other than that, it's an amazing game.<br /><br />Thanks for reading! I hope that I could help!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Weird, funny, and entertaining. We enjoyed the trip back in time. Just as crazy as the first one with a surprise ending.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I stayed up all night reading this book I loved it so much!! Couldn't put it down. Would recommend as a good romance novel to anyone
B00340ESIS|4.0|As a non-fiction author who is just started to get involved with screenplays, I found \\"Save the Cat\\" a great starting point. The book was an easy read and I finished it in 2 days. The advice is solid and Snyder presents it in a clear, easy to understand format.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very good, easy to play. Highly recommended. Its kinda hard to remember all the tiles. But after playing it for a while, you learn how to pair the tiles.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well told story.  Pace kept me wanting more.  Anxious to start the next book in the series as soon as possible.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Being the year of the 50th anniversary of the beloved super spy, the 23rd Bond installment had a lot to live up to. While Casino Royale was a worthy and thrilling reboot to the franchise, Quantum of Solace fell flat with critics. To make matters more interesting, MGM has had financial woes over the. I like that
0099413140|5.0|I'm not sure how much my 3 year old likes this book but I think it's hysterical. It's good to point out that queens where underpants just like everyone else.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I was able to read only some 15 pages of this stuff. There should be a warning: not suitable for kids below 17 years of age and completely not suitable for men over, say 50 years of age.<br /><br />Oh well, I have wasted more money on worse crap.
0525478817|5.0|Never have I cried for a book. John Green is one of my favorite authors, and wow. Just amazing. Everyone must read this book.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Alawar games just keep getting better and better! This fun, freaky and challenging. Love that you could play in expert mode to make even more challenging!  cant wait for the next game, Alawar Ent., Inc!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A classic. It's one of his best, all of which are wonderful. A definite 10\10. Love it always. Always will.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|It looks nice and will do a good job of protecting my HD. I would like to have a place to stash a stylus.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I bought this movie because I'd recently enjoyed the flood of superhero genre films being released.  The premise of this film seemed different from the rest, just as 'Watchmen' had been in the same vein but very different.  Since I had thoroughly enjoyed 'Watchmen', I thought I might also enjoy 'Kick-Ass' in the same way.  Well, I most certainly enjoyed 'Kick-Ass', but it was so much better than what I had expected.  Granted, there was more blood and violence than I expected, but that's not a problem for me.  The film had so much more action, comedy, character development, everything I look for in this type of film.  It even had Nicolas Cage in what I considered his best role in years, where he could go a bit over the top, but that's what the role needed.<br />Maybe this is yet another case of going into a film with lukewarm expectations, so the exceeding of those expectations is not a bridge too far, but I believe for pure entertainment value, 'Kick-Ass' delivered with a knockout.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I went to see this movie in the theaters thinking that this wasn't going to be great. I know it sounds weird like then why did you go see it. Well I went to see it cuz I Nagging little brothers but that's not the point. The point is the movie is really good and I'm actually glad that I went to go see it.
B004QL7K70|2.0|Hmmm, what can I say about this movie?  I guess it lived up to its billing, and there's really only so much you can do with this kind of premise.  Maybe I just wanted so kind of big twist, some life-altering events that really hit home.  I guess I didn't get any of that, so I can only give it 2 stars.  Eh .....
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Love it...but, wished it would edit EPUB's I often use files that have links to other data. It would be nice if you could just click on links and have them open the other files or data.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Action packed movie from beginning to end. Great story based on true events. This is the best martial arts movie I have ever seen. Had to own it!

B005OCFHHK|5.0|I bought this Blue Ray set as a Christmas present for my daughter. She loved it, therefore so do I!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It had my attention from beginning to end. I busted out in fits of laughter and cried almost uncontrollably. This book was able to make me run a marathon of emotions and loved every word of it!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|My wife absolutely loves this backpack.  She was hoping for an official Cannon backpack for Christmas.  After reading other customer's reviews and watching the user videos, I purchased this backpack instead.  She loves it!  She spent an hour or two today putting all of her cameras and camera supplies in the backpack and customizing the compartments.  I looked it over when she was finished and was pretty impressed.  This seems like a much better product than the price would lead you to believe.  Everything fits securely in the customize-able main compartment.  This thing has a lot of smaller pockets, compartments to satisfy every camera lover and carry all of their accessories.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a camera backpack as a gift for a photographer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|so much fun to play, my 6 year old has so much fun playing this. We love the daily challenges and missions.
B005WGBQ9G|3.0|I orded the complete set of season 2 we received 4 disc, 2 of disc 3, and missing episode #13 by the dying fire, ??? make it right amazon. do not want to send back all for just one episode.
