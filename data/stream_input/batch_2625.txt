B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome!!!! Exciting... romantic...action packed.....superb! I can't wait to read the next book and the next and the next... last word.
B005898CFI|5.0|I am a great fan of John Wayne and although John is more famous for his Western and War movies I have to say that Hatari is by far one of my favorite movies starring John Wayne. The supporting cast in this movie as well as the sound track is excellent as well.
B001NOQI3U|4.0|wish she still made movies like this would have loved to see how her directorial style evolved over the years after she stopped directing films.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|We got this for my son to use for his school homework.  Love the large numbers, easy to use. A++
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game that challenges the brain, it is really hard for me to put it down. I just got my mom hooked.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great. Addicted from the start. Finished all levels in a night. Need more levels please! Love the challenge
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|great app it is very easy to use on the kindle fire. hopefully google decides to keeps it around.I have never had any problem with it glitching like other readers.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I read a ton of reviews and some were good and others were ok. this app does have problem for it wont allow its self to be put on my kindle. I have no other youtube apps, unfilled data space and there's nothing wrong with my kindle. I had faith in this app, but none are working right
0312330537|3.0|The underclass of India, and Mumbai in particular, seems to be an endless source for authors.  This is a too long book with too many descriptions of 'what they were wearing, etc.'.  Easy to skim, though.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|The costuming, cinematography,  and the scenery choices added to the well written script. I easily fell into the story and it stayed fairly close to the book. This adaptation is by far the better of ones I have seen.
B000HZGCEG|5.0|I was so excited when I learned that the movie I had been searching for could be found on Amazon.  I looked everywhere for this movie and finally I was actually able to possess it through Amazon.  Amazon is the greatest.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was a Tina Fey fan before but after reading her book, I am a super fan. I had the chance to read &#34;Bossy Pants&#34; on a very long flight. The woman next to me noticed I was shaking and asked if I was OK. I was happy to explain the shaking was from laughter caused by the the book I was reading.  It's good stuff.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I origianlly started to watch it because the main actress used to live in my area and I met her when she was on One Tree Hill and was really nice. Im glad I watched it, its a cute little show that goes over the awkwardness of highschool.
B00BUI6D2A|3.0|should have bought the single to the song i liked instead of the whole album. Still a huge fan though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is a fun and partly challenging game to play. very hip and happening. great game to play when bored.
B004498KPU|5.0|One of the best purchases I am sure I have ever made!<br /><br />What can I say? If you are a Michael Jackson fan, and I am, this is a must have for your collection!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved every minute of this Season just as I did the first two.  It is filmed so well.  Every episode is like watching a mini movie.  Loved it!!!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Love, love, love... I love that I can get the comic book world without reading the comics. I love the stories just don't want to read the comics.
B001DEXDNI|3.0|I didn't know what to expect when I bought this CD.  Annie Lennox is,  for me, a 'quirky' singer who does some things well.<br />So, it is with this CD.  Some of the tracks, I love.  Some I don't.<br />Committed  Annie Lennox Fans will probably love this CD.<br />As for me.  Not the worst CD I have bought, but, not the best either.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a really good book.  We live in Allen Texas and sadden when he was killed.  I bought and read the book after hearing so many good things about him.  In his short life Chris Kyle did many outstanding things.  He will be missed
B00992CF6W|5.0|its ok but when i put in the seed 81#18on creative its awesome because of diamonds right under it but it  doesnt work for survival.
B00AOQ8MOQ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies...Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, and lots of action!  Definitely, a must see.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|Kanye is not averse to pushing the envelope.  He has always been a top tier rap/hip-hop producer and a mediocre rapper.  The production, beats and overall creativity has carried him and been what has allowed him to stand as such a \\"great\\" that he believes in his own mind (judging by his actions).<br /><br />This album may be creative and \\"different\\" (clearly), but it is mediocre at best sonically.  Music of course should be creative and artistic, but the truest value in music is that it sounds good.  I am sorry to say, but the musical quality is just not there.  I appreciate the envelope pushing.  But this album just seems to be trying too hard to be something.<br /><br />Kanye compares himself to Michael a lot.  And this sort of self-honoring is typical of Kanye's persona.  My feeling right now is that the Michael he most compares to at the moment is Tyson.  Yes, he was a great and came onto the scene fast, furious and loud, but eventually he was biting off ears and getting beat up in the ring.  That is how I feel about this album.  Kanye being a shadow of his former self, taking a virtual beating in the ring, and maybe becoming even a bit more famous in the process, although not in the way you want to be famous.<br /><br />Instead of making music like a guy in a dark room flailing about for a light switch, Kanye should look for a Zen moment and bounce back with some art that makes you want to nod your head.<br /><br />Just One Man's Take...
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|It is wonderful to be able to stream a classic movie for free with my Amazon Prime membership. I was already more than satisfied with my Prime membership and then decided to give me even more for my money.<br /><br />&#34;We hit the deer and his paw... What do you call it? The paw.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The hoof.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Got caught in the grill. I got to hack it off.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Ma, it's a sin to leave it there..

B000PFFSKM|5.0|probably Tull's greatest record. is my favorite anyway. early stuff. good tunes. to cry you a song ,with you here to help me . awesome.
B00BE97ONM|3.0|Caught my interest quickly but then just as quickly petered out.  I knew the &#34;culprit&#34; long before then ending.  Also saw where the ending of going - was not surprised at all.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this game is so dull, it barely give you options to make you character lokk great. when you what to come your person's hair you legitly have to do it by each strand. it takes so long for a hair do thats not even good looking. i would rate this app no stars if i could.<br /><br />There is this other game called toca boca hair salon 2 and i bought it, its so worth the $3 it has a large variety to style your hair. ypu can grow it, comb it, shave it,curl it, straghted it, crimp it. then you cpuld dye it with colors. after, you can put on (way) cooler accessories and the awesome part is its in the whole process of going to a hair salon.
1439153663|4.0|I thought the book was good! It held my attention and at times I couldn't put it down, but I thought the end was rushed. It ended too quickly - the author could have gone a few more chapters and finalized the characters...I would have liked to see Lavinia and Will get together, or at least see Will's wife have her baby, or maybe develop of story of revenge again Rankin (he deserved it)!...maybe there will be a sequel? Otherwise great story, unfortunately a lot of historical fiction stories do have some truth behind them, and what a sad sad time in history!
B0062QRTKA|3.0|This is a very delightful game which I THOROUGHLY enjoyed.....yet in the description I wish they had based the story of &quot;Mo&quot; also known as Moses<br /> off of the actual story from the Bible. So because of that I take away 2 stars from the rating.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This was fun for the first 3 or 4 days. The graphics are pretty and the music is relaxing. It does have a lot of missions that require pearls that you either have to earn (very very slowly) or buy. My problem is that it will no longer connects to the server. Game I can't play is wasted space on my kindle so it is now deleted.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|My favorite part of the game was all of the puzzles and the story line G5<br />has made a lot of good games
B00C1S945G|5.0|One of the best Television shows ever aired! The HD version makes it even more enjoyable. They should have all seasons in HD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever you compete to beat all your friends on Facebook it so awesome I love it
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is my new addiction! I'll be playing it for a long time for sure. Wish I had found it years ago.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a feat game and it had me stumped for a few minutes but it isn't long enough. You will most likely finish all the levels in an hour or two.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|If it wasn't for this book, I would have lost my marriage. We have both read it and are using its methods and are a better and stronger marriage for it.
1591845556|3.0|Before you buy this book you have to ask yourself this basic question: do you want the be a Jack of all trades or the master of some? Then, you may ponder about the \\"self-help-ish\\" or \\"magic number-ish\\" 20 hours issue (you will learn that this is the personal experience of the author). But, the title sounds too good to ignore, too enticing to leave, so you still buy the book. You will be disappointed.<br /><br />You will find that the author wants to do soooooo many things, but there is never enough time to do them all. (Aren't we all staring at our bucket lists with the same quiet desperation?) But, here is a method that allows you to beat the confining principles of being realistic, prioritization AND focusing. It contains 10 principles of rapid skill acquisition (1, love the stuff; 2, focus on the stuff; 3, decide how good you really want to be; 4 through 9 are really no brainers and 10, emphasize quantity and speed) and  10 principles of effective learning (1, research the stuff; 2, just do it; 3, identify mental models, etc.). The method is then demonstrated using the author's preferred random skills: yoga, programming, typing, go, ukulele, windsurfing.<br /><br />So, why will you be disappointed? Because most of us have only a few \\"dream skills\\", but would like to do them at a higher level than many disconnected things at an average/below average level. It may be the question of a high enough dose of Ritalin, but an average adult does not dream to do a periodization of 20 hour cycles of random skills. If one jumps from one skill to the next, what becomes of the necessary practice time of the earlier skill? I understand that the author simply wanted to demonstrate how well his method applies to unrelated \\"arts\\", but here is where the book falls short. Instead of demonstrating how generally applicable the method is, I would much rather get into the method itself through the acquisition of a single skill (not to forget the difference in between learning unicycling or playing the piano, doing karate or breeding Saint Bernards). Some demands extensive knowledge of theory, while others based on mostly practice. (There is also no breakdown of how the 20 hours was spent, say, while learning yoga. At one point a 90 minute instruction is mentioned, then a 3 hours instruction. How much time was spent with researching the basic theory?)  Mental scaffolding or mental models/lattice work could have been used to demonstrate applicability of this single skill, instead of creating an easy target for criticism by rushing through eclectic ventures. I would have expected more learning about learning itself and how elements of knowledge/skill aquisition are similar (but not the same) in between widely varied topics. But it is questionable, if there is one general \\"learning DNA\\" that could generate both flea an and elephant skills.<br /><br />Principle 3 of rapid skill acquisition \\"Define your target performance level\\" is why most of us will give up on this book. At the end it is not about frustration barriers, 20 hours, methods or skill acquisition, but dealing with plateaus. George Leonard in his excellent book \\"Mastery\\" describes exactly the type of path this author wanders upon. It is the \\"Dabbler\\", the eternal kid. The end of the first 20 hours may actually signify the first inevitable plateau, where admitting how demanding something can be and how much more effort and commitment it requires to move on to the next level is simply dismissed by moving on to a brand new project. I may be wrong, but the \\"target performance level\\" is much more of the journey itself than a destination.g or playing the piano, doing karate or breeding Saint Bernards).

B00499NHLC|5.0|You don't need to be familiar with Sherlock Holmes books to like this modern-day Sherlock series. Both actors do a great job. Can't wait for the next season to release!
1932100660|5.0|After reading this book and Caldwell Esselstyn's book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, I couldn't find any reason not to jump whole heartedly into this way of eating. In addition to the astonishing mountain of evidence Campbell presents in this book, it seems to make good common sense to eat nutrient dense and calorie light. Unlike some negative reviewers suggest, you don't have to eat 2000 calories of spinach a day to get your calories. All kinds of unrefined carbs are included in this way of eating. My adoption of this diet started slowly, but I've been 100% committed for one month now. I have tons of energy and have lost weight eating large quantities of food. The food is tasty and fulfilling. There is a great side effect in that kitchen clean-up is a breeze without those greasy, crusty pans to scrub! Go ahead and try it. What do you have to lose - except extra pounds?
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Yes there is money needed but only if you want to fall into the basterds that make the others  that want to plau for free, need to pay to gain,  other wise waiting for the cool downs and such not that bad. Good grafics and a solid rpg. Like I kinda said good free game unless u wana be OCD about it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Thank you amazon prime for including this awesome show in the prime package- DA is amazing and makes everything else on tv just seem so stupid. Literally.
B00785P2QC|2.0|If your ok with posting on Facebook that your playing games then it's fun, otherwise look elsewhere.  I'd rather the boss not know I'm building a city on his time.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I LOVED The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Sun's.  I trudged through thus book , trying to keep all the characters straight....it jumped around slot. I did not feel there was much of a plot.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This book was a nice, easy read. I thought there was good character development, which held my interest. I felt that it opened strong, but lacked the same intensity in the last third of the story. It seemed the writer lost her vigor and just wanted to finish the book. The writer went back and forth with the colloquial dialect. I would have enjoyed reading the character's true vernacular throughout.  I did, however, enjoy the book.
B0062QRTKA|1.0|This was the free app the day I installed it, butit was still over priced! The graphics and animation is cheesy. On the whole, it needs more work!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a very interesting series set in the 1920's which shows the lives of different people groups (servants and the wealthy).  I have found it quite intriguing and informational - great series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a great sequel. I can't wait to start Mocking Jay. This series has a powerful message and is a very good read.
B003F48E4W|4.0|If you were alive in the '80's and never saw this movie chances are you area communist plant sent here to undermine America.  Fun vampire movie with tons of bad '80's quotes and music.  However, despite it's cheesy parts it definitely has some memorable ones.  Another movie I enjoyed watching 20-something years later with my 7yr old.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Definitely worth the wait! I waited so Kong for thus book to come out and am totally in love! CANNOT wait for The One
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Very easy to read with no glasses required.Wish I had this long ago! Every member of the family now has this on their phone.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The movie did not follow the story shown in the book closely. Good movie though. If you compare book to the movie, it feels different.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|This was the best Twilight movie since BD part 1!  I am a super fan and loved the way that Bill Condon presented the material.  Thank you to him for his efforts and thank all of the actors for portraying their characters with class and for keeping the fans who love and cherish their characters in mind.  I know it's not Shakespeare, but it's important to the fans that it was shown the way it was!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I am enjoying playing.  Great graphics.<br />Love the horror stories.  Wish I had more time to play.  Having fun with the game.
034580404X|5.0|For someone who does not really like to read much, this book certainly makes me want to not put it down and want to read it all at once.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|Not good for young kids.  My 7 and 9 year old kids were upset after watching this movie.  My 7 year old had trouble falling asleep as he was worried about having nightmares.  Warning...it brought up many questions about pets and death.
B00AG297GK|1.0|I would have given it a .5 star if I could have simply because I thought it would be funny and it wasn't...
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I Love the music, videos and antics of these guys! Count me in on any other releases. Check this group out, they are wonderful!?
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Ok, the star rating is a 9 year old's opinion.  I haven't watched it, but I have heard the &#34;singing&#34; and it is terrible.  I have liked other similar movies, High School Musical, Spectacular, etc.  But I cringe just listening to this one.  So, adults avoid it but Tweens will probably enjoy it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm on Facebook all the time checking things out or sending messages to family i use it every day and i love it
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Excellent game. Easy to control. Fun and is just difficult enough to make you cheer out loud when you play really well.....this isn't for golf purist however ....
B006BQM762|3.0|I don't know what it was. The film was fun. I enjoyed it, but it just had a few problems I just couldn't get over. The biology teacher surviving the train wreck? Why the alien was kidnapping people.<br /><br />One of those films I saw, I enjoyed, but I have no intention on ever watching again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It has been fascinating watching this traditional British aristocratic family move from one generation into the next.  Combine this with the lives of their servants and how they interconnect makes for interesting tv beyond the cop and lawyer shows.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|Fits perfectly, looks good and protects my Kindle.  Has all the features of a more expensive model and a fraction of the price.
B0088D3PYE|2.0|I loved Shadow and the Wind and Angel's Game. I couldn't wait for this latest book to be translated. And I felt cheated. It read like a précis'd version of the Comte Di Monte Cristo. What happened to the library? What happened to the 'angel'? so many loose ends. Is this what happens when you become a phenomenon? You have to churn out words with no substance? Come on Carlos Ruiz Zafon, I expect more from you!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I'm not sure how to start this review. At the beginning of this book I thought Drew was the biggest jerk and I was a bit disgusted with his sexual behavior. (I am still disgusted by it) However, by the end of this book he had me loving him! He was so charming and just wouldn't back down. He was such a gentleman to Kate during that business dinner. Oh, I just fell in love with him.<br /><br />There were so many funny and sweet lines in this book. I was laughing out loud at numerous scenes and getting teared up at others. Such a fun, fast read and I hated when it came to an end. It was so interesting reading a first person pov from the male's position. I liked it and want more. Although, it would have to live up to the entertainment of this book. I hope Emma Chase writes more books like this.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br /><br />\\"Like a four-year-old with his wooby, I bring my prized pillow with me.\\" Awwww, how cute is that?<br /><br />When Drew first sees Kate: \\"The bottom line is, for a moment, I forget how to breathe.\\"<br /><br />This had me LOL. So funny! \\"'Dude, she was one fugly chick, but once I saw her chomping that romaine, I just had to nail her.'\\"<br /><br />How adorable was his niece? :) \\"Mackenzie walks over to us and holds up a glass jar half-filled with dollar bills. I slide a dollar into it.\\" I loved it when the swear jar goes up to $10. :)<br /><br />\\"I'm in love with her. Totally. Helplessly. Pathetically. In love. Kate owns me. Body and soul. She's all I think about. She's everything I never thought I wanted. She's not just perfect - she's perfect for me. I'd do anything for her. Anything. I want her near me, with me. All the time. Forever.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm not lying to you now, Kate. But it's okay. Do what you need to do. Curse me out, slap me around - get it all out of your system. I can take it. Because the more you push me away, the harder I'm going to fight to prove to you that this is real. That I'm not going anywhere and that what I feel for you isn't going to change. And then someday-maybe not any time soon, but one day-I'm going to tell you that you, Kate Brooks, are the love of my life and you won't have any doubt that it's true.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'll cherish it. I'll do anything I have to to make her happy. For as long as she'll let me.\\"<br /><br />This one made me smile. \\"God she's beautiful. I mean, look at her. She's like a volcano going off - fierce and fiery and breathtaking. If she doesn't find a way to ugly herself down, I'm going to be spending an awful lot of time pissing her off.\\"<br /><br />So loved this book! I finished it in one night.r you isn't going to change.

0937381888|5.0|This is the best book on homebrewing out there.  It breaks down everything in easy to understand terms.  It also goes more in depth into the science aspect than other books out there.  This should be the first book you get when you start brewing.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the options it gives me. Regular solitaire is too confining. Solitaire is a good thinking game. Everyone should play such a game.<br /><br />The problem I find with the game is that it doesn't give you the option to just quit. The game you had before just stays there until you either play it over or you ask it to show you how to win it. Sometimes you just need to quit a game to answer the door and many other reasons.<br /><br />I find it a necessary game for me to have and appreciate that it is either free or low cost.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Good product for the price. A little awkward to use but works fine. I like the rat tail file because it can be used for many things
B00881VLCE|2.0|Can't say as it would not download or something. Maybe I did not follow through or changed my mind for some reason, don't remember.
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|I generally works by Courtney Milan even though I don't think her efforts are the best of the genre.  They're usually ok for a quick and usually lower priced read.  I felt this story was slow and a bit boring.  I don't know how anyone could have given it a 4 star rating.  Courtney Milan definitely could've done better than this snooze fest.  Sorry Courtney..
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like this because it is not too difficult yet challenging because of the time limits. It is relaxing in its simplicity and a little happiness or something gay (not gender gay) thrown in.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I find this app to be very helpful. I do many hospital and nursing home clergy visits for church members and friends and family. There are times I don't have my Bible with me in the car but I always have my phone with the Bible app on it to save the day. Thanks for this app.

B00CEJ2EKE|4.0|If you're an Amon Amarth fan, you know what to expect from these guys by now. The overall sound of their music hasn't changed much over the years, yet we welcome every new release with open arms every time. Deceiver of the Gods is no exception. I will say that this is a much better album than their previous 'Surtur Rising', but doesn't beat the best ('With Oden On Our Side' in my opinion). The only track that I found to be a bit dull was 'Hel'. Aside from that, you'll get the standard AA fare of Norse mythology and \\"things that warriors do\\" over some quality melodic death metal tunes.<br /><br />After giving it a listen you may feel compelled to raid fishing villages along the coast.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I'm like this game a lot and I don't even play warlike games... Except Frontline Commando, as in the first one.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I just want to play bingo when I'm in the mood.  I don't care about whether I'm supposed to be in Madrid or anywhere else!! Also much of time I can't just choose a certain number of cards to just play.  It often won't let me do that.
B00CCEHR80|4.0|You can say what you want about Jerry Garcia, I never get's old listening to an old friend having a good time.This music will live on forever. Enjoy your evening, play a little Jerry, and let the good times roll.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved his previous books and love this one also. I give it 41/2 but couldn't put in the half star. The book is not an easy read - it makes you think and learn . I would highly recommend it
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|If you ever asked yourself, What ever happened to Eric Burdon. Well, he has a great new piece of music that will blow your socks off. Get off the couch and buy this C.D. It will have you dancing in your underwear.If that's what you like to dance in....
B00007E7K0|5.0|Somewhere I lost the lens cap for my Canon Rebel XSi standard camera lens. I saw several knock off versions, bought this one as the real thing. It is a bit different from the original cover, but I like the changes better than the original. Opened it and it snapped right on the lens as advertised.
B009M4KTEM|4.0|If you still want to let the good times roll, here is your chance. Jerry and his band mates get their groove on. I never get tired of the tunes these guy's put out, Even though it was a few years back. It could have been last night. Oh yeah, it was.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|City of Ember meets Hunger Games, but better written on both counts!  Get it -you won't regret it except for being sleep -deprived.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|With all the albums that get released after the passing of an artist, We still can't get enough. Jimi's works on this piece take it one step farther,And I'm already looking forward to the next step.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great version of Magic for players of any skill. The new sealed deck campaign is a nice addition to this series.
B00B10HAO2|4.0|Anthony Hopkins nails this character.  And we all love Hitchcock.  Helen Murren as his wife is wonderful...<br />Slow, almost a documentary..I really enjoyed it, may watch it again, glad it's in my library.
B00B769XB8|5.0|This is not your typical hansel and gretle fairy tale.  Great action!  I bought it in 3d which makes the visuals even better. Highly recommend the 3 d for all
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Started off watching a rented blu-ray copy and thought the quality was great, but the movie started skipping halfway through despite cleaning.  Blu-ray is sensitive to the most minor of scratches and makes for a poor rental format unfortunately.<br /><br />So decided to try Netflix and Amazon streaming head to head to see how they compare.  Playback was through the streaming functionality of my Panasonic Blu-ray player.  Neither had the video quality of the Blu-ray but Amazon was closest in that regard, and the video quality was generally very good.  Netflix video was a bit of letdown, lots of video degradation (macro blocking) during high motion scenes which is usually a sign of poor encoding management.  The audio on Amazon however turned out to be the big let down, wasn't even multi-channel, just simple stereo.  The audio on Netflix wasn't bad and at least was 5.1 although with not the same dynamic range and quality that I heard on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Streaming is getting better, but still a tough sell for those that like quality.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play solitaire game with good options to add a little variety. The advertisements are annoying in the Free version but then that's why it's free - it goes with the territory. It's a good &#34;recommend&#34; as an enjoyable way to pass the time.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have been a huge Star Wars fan since I was little because it's how my dad and I bonded.  Being able to have the complete saga just brings back memories of my dad and I hanging out together.  Of course the newer episodes were not as great, but it was cool seeing them all.  My husband and I got to bond with our daughter more by watching these and that is always fantastic.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great first movie in the quasi-trilogy that will be made into four movies.  While the story line is not directly from the book, it remains true to the book in the essential points, and definitely leads to the sequel.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I think it is impossible to go wrong with a Sophia Kinsella book, this one was absolutely delightful! The main character wakes up in the hospital after a slip down some wet steps, however it is actually 3 years later and she is completely different from who she used to be. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys light romantic comedies with a few laughs thrown in.
1452110581|5.0|This book is hilarious. A MUST HAVE for cat lovers! Though I think it may have given my cats some ideas...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love how Stephen wrote this book. At some points I actually felt like I was Charlie himself. This definitely deserves five stars
1401324649|3.0|It had a very good story. I didn't like the way it kept switching back and form from the past to the present. I finally just read the chapters in the order of the activity then went back and read the chapters that continued to the present. Wonderful old man. What a variety of escapades.
B00881VLCE|1.0|loved it at first. BUT this game worked for a short while, now I can't get it to come up.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great price for all the discs.  The movie itself it bad to the bone, can't wait for 2 and 3.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun and easy to use .... easy because of the cards.. i love solitaire since i was a kid. i strong recommend..
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This movie is a real change of pace from the normal Santa/Christmas movies.  Very happy with it and will now be a yearly watcher.
B001NHNG64|1.0|The WORST BOOK EVER. LOL JUST kidding I just wanted to say haters gonna hate. But the other one star and two star reviews are full of crap and are bs 110%
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great price for all these discs and the movie itself is phenomnal.  I'm glad they thought out of the box for this one.
B00499QUK2|5.0|It will only take the first couple of scenes to realize how great this show is. After that, you are hooked and you'll be a fan. Can't wait for the next season.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I don't like having to sign in, cause at church I want to be able to just click on the app and type in the book, chapter and verse
B004UID2LC|5.0|I don't know what all the complaints are about. I've updated and used this app and it works fine with my Samsung Galaxy S3. No virus signature detected by any virus program. Great App.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|The game is great I like it. Good game play. Nothing but the best way to play a flying game on a tablet
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is a classic zombie humor film. I love this movie and am so happy to have it in my collect!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I just got the full version,  and then the void just came. Now I have a glitch, all words are gone. I can't see the hint timer, no idea how many elements I have, it just won't show up. I'm only putting 5 stars so that I can get the update
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Now I love my note pad! I am sure there is others but this one is workable for me. It is easy and simple to use! I now keep track of appointments and what I have to tell the doctor when I go to the appointment. I keep track of birthdays. I color code them. ex; the most important Red, I really easy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game ROCKS! You can do any thing. In creative mode you have everything you need to build stuff (blocks , lava, bookshelves, food etc.) You can also do  survives in which you start with absolutely nothing and you have to go find it. But watch out, in survival because there are mobs who will kill you and take your stuff. (Zombies, spiders, and creepers and skeletons.)
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|There are plenty of positives with this program.  Johnny Lee Miller delivers a brilliant incarnation of the famed Sherlock Holmes.  Egotistical yet flawed, its impossible not to love this characters razor sharp whit paired with confident, sound deductive reasoning and observational prowess.  He's a genius and he'll let you know it.  My only concern is, well...to put it bluntly, is it too smart for the television viewing masses?  I hope not.  This show is a bright spot in an otherwise dismal network television landscape.  The cable networks have overtaken the ratings and viewers.  This show deserves its place among these highly rated shows (we all know what they are) and should stand tall as an exceptionally smart, funny, and thoroughly entertaining program.  Sherlock has never been so cool!
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I could not wait to see what happened next. I am sure part of my fascination with the story is due to the fact we had recently watched a tv series on the occupation of Guernsey. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Clever puzzles, not too challenging. Good free app, fun for summer. Much better than some of the other free puzzles with rooms and doors :-)
193700788X|1.0|This recent title left me angry. I agree with some of the reviewers here who think this may have been done by a ghost writer. It contains none of the quirky characteristics that some of the characters had from the start. We came to know them and love them, but in the end, they held none of their original qualities.  Eric's character was the most disappointing. I won't be recommending this book to anyone.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Something great finally came from the old texts. This is a fun game. Who wouldn't want to be Moses and part the sea and help people across.
0756407915|3.0|This book wasn't enjoyable because there's no (and even reverse) progression. Denna, now a beaten prostitute instead of just an enigma, ends up having a worse relationship with Kvothe than at the beginning. Kvothe, instead of being innocent and bright, is a sex-fiend and a murderer. The Chandrian are definitely real, but we knew that way in the beginning of the first book anyway. There's a war raging, but it never really matters.<br /><br />I'm no expert, but I think the plot should have stayed on more common ground for foundational support. It's nice the author is creative and can make a ton of side-quests, but he zigzags in a kind of endless, linear pattern that makes everything seem pasted on.<br /><br />I come away less interested in the story and the characters.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Very handy light.  I put two in a corner coat closet, and one in a bilco cellar door area.  Automatic function works perfect.  wont come on when its light, but only when it is dark.  Stays on for about 10 seconds w/o motion detected.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These are great fresh batteries at an amazing price.  I use these in 2 of my red dot sights and in a calculator.  You can't go wrong with this package!!!
B00AHSLU2C|1.0|Rented for my daughter, it glitched, then wouldn't play sound for remainder of the rental period. Wish I could get a refund......
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|The picture and sound on this blu ray disc are like night and day when compared to the previous standard DVD versions. The 5.1 audio is incredible. When the music sequences are played, which is of course the most important it is fantastic. Dynamic, crystal clear sound with no one instrument drowning out the other. Ticket to Ride has always been my favorite on this soundtrack. Paul's bass and backing vocals mixed with John's lead vocal sound like never before. The 5.1 comes through loud and incredibly clear. I have sold all my previous versions of Help! I know this is a gushing review, but for me this one is all you need. Fellow Beatlemaniacs you will love this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is one of my favorites!! I've read it twice its so good!! Can't wait to see the next movie!!!!!!<br />I ❤ Hunger Games!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I wish that the levels would have gotten progressively harder and there should be more levels... It was entertaining, though.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|I have purchased this dvd five or six times now...it tends to go &#34;missing&#34; from my house after friends watch it. The songs and story are timeless.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Fantastic mind bender; will keep you on the edge of your seat. Probably one of the best movies made since 2000.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This was a beautifully nuanced, meaningful film, well-acted by a talented cast, and superbly told.  I enjoyed it very much.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Anothing touching story, beautifully written. It is always a joy for me to read a book from this author.He dosn't write one novel after another just for the money!!!!  Fantastic!
B0060DYMT6|5.0|I found the subject matter (Magic) to be interesting and the film also had some historical validity because it concerned itself with the time frame in  history when  electricity was being introduced into the lives of the common man and women. The film touched upon the fascination that many of us have with magic which brings back memories of childhood, and also sparking the scientific curiosity that also dwells in some of us. The fact that the film concerned itself with Nicola Tesla shocked me , and I very much liked the climax of the movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It really turns out good.  I guess if you really love someone things can get better and work out.  Thanks
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book because I was looking for something interesting and man did I get what I wanted. Its a very interesting story and very mysterious (which is good). I found myself whispering &#34;dont do it&#34; or &#34;no no no no&#34; while reading. It does have a slightly dark plot with it being set under ground and all in a silo but nothing to steer anyone away!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book a must read.  Really not what I thought it would be but it gives you insight to a different world.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book has a twist I never expected and just when I was about to give it up I got sucked right in.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|good humor/ action and entertaining.  will add to my dvd collection.  i recommend if you like spiderman and xmen types of movies.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As  usual Khaled Hosseini did it again.  Can't put the book down.  It just keeps you involved and appreciating the cultural differences that exist in other parts of the world.  Your haert will be stirred.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|My phone display is just too small for me to appreciate this app. When I enlarge the page, I get lost. I'm not that used to using the android phone, so I need something easy. I uninstalled it finally.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My children and I both love this game.  We check on Nemo and his reef daily.  It is much better than having pets:)
B000JML90Y|4.0|I have gone all these years without reading 'On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection'. I'm still not halfway through it yet, so I can't comment on the 'evolution controversy' it caused. So far I haven't read anything that I consider controversial yet. I lose time when reading Darwin because I find him so interesting, and to know that his work was the foundation for other men of science to work from.
B005K17RU0|1.0|this wether site didn't give me anything but present weather I wanted to know about coming weather.  If available there should be a way to get to the information.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I first heard Diana Krall on Spotify and I was hooked. She has such a smooth, sexy, smokey voice. I don't know where I've been not to have heard her before. I would definitely recommend purchasing one of her albums.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Great puzzles. Really challenges your memory. Can't wait for more rooms. I did have some problems with figuring out what to tap, tried to tap everything so no stone was left unturned.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Very cleverly conceived theme, plotline and character development. In short, an amazing story. This is the \\"dark\\" parallel universe film to Leonardo DiCaprio's \\"Catch Me if You Can\\". Where the latter delivers identity theft with a wink and a twinkle, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY exposes such a theft as an ominous screenshot of a mentally ill personality. I always wondered about all the fuss over Matt Damon:  after watching this movie, then tracing his recent performances in \\"Behind the Candleabra\\" then \\"We Bought a Zoo\\" and \\"Invictus\\" I'm fully convinced of The Talented Mr. Damon. Watch the film with good friends, then go out to dinner and have yourself a great time discussing and dissecting it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. I love problem solving games. if you like those kind of games you will really enjoy this one. my only problem was that I solved all levels too fast.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game but way too short. Hope they make more levels soon. Fun and challenging. Definitely a thinking game and worth downloading! You won't regret it.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I wanted to read this again. I had read Tom Sawyer many years ago, while in school. I found it interesting and somewhat provocative, seeing that it was written so many years ago.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not truly a conclusion per se. And at some point, SOMEONE has to survive to win the game of thrones. A lot of story lines to follow.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It's Indiana Jones, how could you not buy this if you're a George Lucas fan.  Could use a little more bonus features though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It keeps me entertained for the longest time. I can spend a long time playing this game. It makes me think and it helps me use my brain.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Never thought I would see De Niro sink that low to act in this trite, well worn story about a highly improbable series of events.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I like the keyboard very much as it helps me quickly type what I need to.  Thanks for the layout option and much more
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Loved every bit...came at a time I needed to turn inward and fine the courage to &#34; begin&#34;. ...thanks.  I have recommended to several
B005LAIHSG|5.0|While not for younger kids overall, parts of it are appropriate if screened carefully. The mix of reality, acting and special effects was/is a real treat. I highly recommend it.
B009A7E7SK|5.0|I love this app...I also downloaded it on my iPhone so that I can have access to it whenever I need it.
B003HC8I5M|5.0|We love Phil Collins and miss new music from him since his retirement. This compilation of standards was/is a rfeshing change from today's hits.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app...I also downloaded it on my iPhone. Sometimes I leave my bible at home and use my kindle or iPhone Holy Bible app.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|Even though the pharmaceutical firms are over-villianized generally, this show explores the greet and manipulation of intelligent people that affirms that depravity of humankind.  Yet, the hero of the story is just that....a hero.
B007XHWROK|5.0|Justin B. always manages to put out one song that makes you get the whole album.  Baby and now As Long as U Luv me.  I love both those songs and I'm sure on Believe there will be more good stuff, can't wait 2 hear the rest.  And Justin B. is lookin' fine!!!!!!!
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|I went to the concert in PA and watching this brought back all thr fun memories of that night!  Metal fans will enjoy!
B0095P33IW|4.0|The only thing I didn't like was the HD quality was NOT HD quality - wish it was what it said.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|Now What?! is the nineteenth full-length studio album by the legendary British Rock band Deep Purple, it was their third studio album with Don Airy on Keyboards and their fifth with Steve Morse on guitar. It was produced by Bob Ezrin and released in 2013.<br /><br />On very first listen, a lot of the album washed over me, leaving a generally positive, but honestly not too impressed or interested impression. With repeat listens however, it revealed itself to be not only a passable, or even above average affair, but a genuinely good one, with literally no weak tracks. It's a grower for sure.<br /><br />Usually, I really enjoy any Deep Purple album, and have enjoyed most Morse era albums to some extent, however sometimes they can feel like there is a bit of filler, or there's a minor lack of consistency, stopping the albums feeling as great as the old days even when over half the album has some genuinely great songs. Now What?! is the perfect Morse era album, it all fits perfectly together, there's variety yet consistency and all the songs are as good as the very best tracks on another Morse era album.<br /><br />Highlights include the symphonic `Uncommon Man' dedicated to the late Jon Lord, which feels like a mixture between Close To The Edge era Yes with Works era ELP, the energetic and memorable `Apres Vous' which has a very catchy chorus, and the interesting and characterful single `Vincent Price' although to be honest its all great.<br /><br />The only real negative thing I can think to say is that the track order may undersell the album's both power and variety. I listen to this record a lot but I often choose to listen to the record on random/shuffle now, and always find it a great and exciting album all the more for having done so, but that's just personal preference, most people have no problems with that running order. Seriously, it's a great album; the rhythm section are tight and steady, Airy and Morse make a real impact and Ian Gillan fits into his older vocal style more comfortably here than ever.<br /><br />Overall; Now What?! is a very good album from the veteran Rock band, easily in the top fifty percent of their catalogue. It's a well produced and well written collection of interesting songs, with a great sense of subtly, musicianship and even a few surprises. Check it out if you like Deep Purple, and especially if you've liked their modern output. And if you do check it out, don't just listen to it once, give it a good few spins and really let it sink in, you'll thank yourself for it after a while.ocal style more comfortably here than ever.<br /><br />Overall; Now What?! is a very good album from the veteran Rock band, easily in the top fifty percent of their catalogue.

B00AEV60GS|4.0|It works. It's very informative, easy to use, and well worth the price. The only reason it didn't get five is that it's just not all that exciting.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Steven Pressfield has written a book that anyone can relate to, whether they consider themselves an artist or not. I found that he accurately represents the battle we all have when it comes to reaching the goals we want to reach and placing them in their proper place in our lives.  It's an easy book to read, broken down into bite size pieces. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to accomplish anything. I can't wait to re-read this gem.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|So, I'm only half-way through the book, but it's a very easy read.  I guess this might count as pseudo-fiction as the names and dates have been changed, or generalized, to protect the men that do this work year after year.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|keeps you on the edge of you seat with all the twists and turns too bad that the  Dexter series is in its last season 8-(
0345529057|5.0|These books are among some of my favorite books that i have ever read. It has been hard for me to find books that keep my interest but these books have really succeeded it that area. They are very compelling and i am constantly wanting to read more to see what happens next. I love the setting of these novels that makes the stories believable at the same time.<br /><br />These books shipped really fast with Amazon Prime and i can say a bad thing about them. The price of these books was much cheaper that anywhere else, so that was also an added benefit. I really recommend the purchase of this book set as i can not say enough to describe how pleased i am with them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me interested until the very end.  I am on to the next one in the triology. I would recommend this book.<br /><br />I wanted to read before I saw the movie
B0050KEVO6|4.0|Awesome, addictive...you won't be able to put it down. I had to make a list of the different combinations to keep up with them all, love it!
159463176X|5.0|A wonderful read with characters that are depicted with compassion and realism.  This story spans generations and is set<br />in Kabul, Paris, Greece, and California.  The interwoven lives of family and those who are not family are painstakingly portrayed.<br />Like a stone thrown in the water that creates ripples long after, our actions and decisions, good and bad, echo through the years.<br />If you liked The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, you will love this book.  I think it is the best of the three.
B00683JK9K|2.0|To hard to move about. Found out that puzzles on Kindle  or any type is not that much fun, more fun on computer where you have the mouse to move pieces about.
0142405809|5.0|Everything about this book is wonderful.  The story, the illustrations - another great book by Julia Donaldson.  I love reading this to my 4 year old daughter and she loves listening to it!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  Flynn is a crafty writer, but this book is pretty dark.  Just know that when you dive in!
0142501123|5.0|My 4 year old daughter is a big fan of the Julia Donaldson books so I ordered this one to complete our library and it didn't disappoint.  Fun to read and fun to listen to!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was such a great find - needed an activity I could do w/grand-daughter. She has been sick but this was perfect FUN for us to do together.  I want MORE!!
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|Great special effects; I'll watch it again soon.  This will be a family favorite!  It might be scary for little ones, though.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's nice....but seems to drain the battery quickly. Make sure you keep the kindle plugged in and charging...otherwise you will sleep way past the alarm because kindle will be off with dead battery when you do wake up.
B008Y7DWC4|1.0|Couldn't even get past the first 15 minutes. Silly and poor quality. The teenagers wouldn't even watch it.<br />Waste of time.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love this game. Very addicting! Can't wait to get my hands on the second version. Couldn't put it down for a second!
B00AAI7B7W|2.0|Sometimes you shouldn't watch a movie a second time or at least not after 3 decades.  Thought it was great back in the day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is AWESOME!!!!!! I love the idea of having a pet horse!!!! Go check out this app right away!!!!!
B00AZNSG0I|3.0|Not sure what Bruce Willis was doing in this movie, maybe a favor? But Henry Cavill did a great job for a subpar plot. The other actor did great with what they had to work with. I blame the story for it not getting 4-5 stars. Overall good movie.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I just got the app last night and I'm very excited  that they finally have it on kindle....now if only they have all the other king games i be really happy
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This game is so amazing that I'm  going to Florida!!!!!! It is a lot of fun trying to get out of all stuff
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It helps me keep track of how much battery have left and it's really helpful and gives me a heads up when my battery is low.
B0062QRTKA|1.0|Boring and pretty stupid. Lame game, someone must have a connection to have gotten a spot light. All you do is swipe your finger across the screen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun you get to build stuff you get to kill monsters and on the new update you get to have animals on creative it's super super fun you should buy it
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book because it held my interest the entire time.  Very creative and different story.  I did NOT like the ending.  However, after all of that... I suppose... ENOUGH was said and done. ha!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it I'd AWESOME. It's needs  sulfate that as wolves and roller coasters a caves :D besides that it is awesome
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was entertaining but I could have written that book from about mid way through to the end. Very fairy tale-ish.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|How do you add people? Please add me need neighbors please help me janetmariefulton@yahoo.com is my username so please add me I play daily
0425263908|5.0|I love the Crossfire series. I have read other Sylvia Day novels but this was the one that got me hooked on her writing. I have started A Touch of Crimson. Hope it is as good as Crossfire.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|For fans new to the Star Trek series, \\"Into Darkness\\" is an entertaining if hyperactive tour of Kirk, Spock, Bones and the Enterprise.  But for fans of \\"Wrath of Khan\\" it acts as an additional layer of enjoyment for that acts as another voice in a Star Trek chorus.  It also sometimes feels like \\"Into Darkness\\" is so enchanted with its predecessor that it doesn't even try and instead settles exclusively on one long homage.<br /><br />The gang's all here, putting on their game faces to play the parts they established in the first film: Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban).  But despite the supposed freedom of having no longer to establish a back story, \\"Into Darkness\\" is slavishly dedicated to reimagining \\"Wrath of Khan,\\" down to the same lines from the script.  But for fans who remember the original, \\"Into Darkness\\" adds another layer of complexity, inverting roles, putting lines in different characters' mouths, and turning threats into opportunities.  It also takes the devil-may-care challenges that Kirk finally admitted to in \\"Wrath of Khan\\" -- tantamount to the scriptwriters admitting that they were on Kirk's side all along -- and tore the veil away to let us know that anything was possible.<br /><br />=== \\"Wrath of Khan\\" ===<br /><br />David Marcus: Lieutenant Saavik was right: You never have faced death.<br /><br />Kirk: No. Not like this. I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.<br /><br />=========<br /><br />Thing is, William Shatner as Kirk was over 50 years old at the time he said those words.  In the younger Kirk's mouth they are prescient -- it changes the tone from a mid-life crisis to a quarter-life crisis, and given the reboot perhaps that's appropriate.<br /><br />That doesn't diminish the love note to the original.  \\"Into Darkness\\" becomes all the more poignant in what it's trying to say -- that friendship is tenuous, that leadership is difficult, that being a leader means making the tough choices -- by making its comparisons to the sacrifices made in \\"Wrath of Khan.\\"  The Kobayashi Maru test figures prominently, testing the mettle of both captains with similar outcomes -- only in \\"Into Darkness\\" we get to see Kirk's famous workaround.  The simulation is a proxy for the audience experiencing the movie's high stakes.<br /><br />===\\"Into Darkness\\" ===<br /><br />Christopher Pike: Do you know what a pain you are? You think the rules don't apply to you. There's greatness in you, but there's not an ounce of humility. You think that you can't make mistakes, but there's going to come a moment when you realize you're wrong about that, and you're going to get yourself and everyone under your command killed.<br /><br />=========<br /><br />The burden of the captain is a heavy one, \\"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,\\" but like an immature sibling \\"Into Darkness\\" isn't able to face the consequences of death as seriously.  \\"Into Darkness\\" has no interest in exceeding the original -- it's content to simply imitate it with a wink and a nod, diverging cleverly to disrupt our expectations while managing to be surprisingly conventional.  And in that regard \\"Into Darkness\\" is both charming and frustrating in its inability to live up to \\"Wrath of Khan.\\" That doesn't make it any less fun.rship is difficult, that being a leader means making the tough choices -- by making its comparisons to the sacrifices made in \\"Wrath of Khan.\\"  The Kobayashi Maru test figures prominently, testing the mettle of both captains with similar outcomes -- only in \\"Into Darkness\\" we get to see Kirk's famous workaround.

0425263924|5.0|It is the best Crossfire yet. I just hope we don't have to wait too long for the next one. I hope Eva uses her Krav Maga on<br />Brett Kline.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome game.  Really reminds of the Atari game I used to play as a kid.  Good for kids too.  Ads can be annoying but I can't complain since I got a free version.
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm rereading the first two books before I move onto the third...and I swear it's like the first time! My husband thanks you Sylvia! Haha! I picture us in these rolls and he gets to take advantage of it :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I became addicted to &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; after seeing the first two seasons on Hulu Plus earlier this year. Imagine my disappointment when I saw that it would not have season 3. However, that was replaced with joy when I learned that Amazon had the exclusive rights & access was covered under my Prime subscription. I love this show! The writing & acting combine the perfect balance of drama & humor. I can laugh & cry watching one episode! And it makes no difference that I already know what happened this season; watching it play out still feels fresh! Although some key characters will be missed, I can't wait to watch season 4--both on PBS and again on Amazon!
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|Seriously, imagine for a moment that the whole Geoff Tate saga never happened, and this was just another Queensryche album. Would you still be giving it 5 stars? Even better, imagine that this album came out circa '94-'97 before the band descended into mediocrity. Side by side with their best material it simply doesn't hold up. I'm not saying this is not a good album, it is, but it's marred by far too many problems. Awful, awful production, songs that feel too short and rushed, and a vibe that seems like it's trying too hard to be \\"modern\\" really hamper this release. I haven't even listened to FU, so nobody can say I'm Tate-biased. I'm just so disappointed by this, which had the potential to be a fantastic album.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|traps you with suspense, very well done series, would definitely recommend, cliff hangers at the end of each show will have you staying up later and later
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This film is on the mark at so many levels.  From a spiritual and metaphysical standpoint it is deep, from a societal standpoint it is accurate, and for plain fun, visuals and action itś terrific.<br /><br />IWhether one is a spiritual seeker or not, this is a special treat.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and I will watch it again very soon.  Interesting the way they took the child story and made it work.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Here is a story of real courage and valor displayed at a time when there was so much killing and destruction.  The fact that it is about a true story, corroborated by both parties, makes it especially compelling.  There are many documented atrocities that happened during WWII.  It is refreshing to know that there were brave people on both sides who were guided by a different moral compass.  That both pilots went on to live rewarding and productive lives and still maintained a healthy respect for each other is a testament to the brotherhood of war that most people will never understand, thankfully.
B0026O475M|5.0|Just an incredably good movie.  Interesting story/concept, well acted, good script, well photographed.<br />I thought the ending was good.  Move on and move forward.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Season 4 is awesome like all the previous seasons.<br />My favorite show on TV today.<br />If you haven't seen Breaking Bad you are missing out!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is just the full version with ads! This app wont waste your time! Actually, it might. its super addicting!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|as per the previous comments great game would be better if it wasn't always asking for money. other than that its a fun game
B006E4QCXU|4.0|With one swipe of your finger, the screen becomes a sight for sore eyes. You can quickly change the settings for a different color or size, and it transforms once again. A stunning app, perfect for when your bored, or you feel you need to be expressive.
030758836X|2.0|Interesting book, however, by the 3/4 mark I had lost any positive feelings for either one<br />of the main characters.  What chapped my ass, however, was the \\"dropped at the curb\\" ending!<br />Seriously?  You devote that many pages writing a novel and then just end it with a line that<br />isn't even thought provoking.  Sorry I wasted my time reading it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Why i say that is because they do not have all the levels ready yet. I think they should have like a hint button or something in that area just in case people get stuck on a certain level. Other than that i believe this is a great game to play and past time. If they fix that i would give them 5 stars. *****
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love pinterest!!!!!!!! It has great recipes. good crafts and awesome ideas for just about amything!!!! Hair. make up. Drinks. Pretty ideas and much much more
B00992CF6W|4.0|Good app, I love the game, but how do you beat it and why can't I do everything I can on the Xbox? Overall, recommended.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It is good if you have a little time to kill, but it sure isn't a learning tool, just so you know.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Love it! Compact and light. Works great. However, touch is not sensitive enough & won't act on the 1st tap.
B00155GDXC|4.0|The book was a page turner for me. At first I didn't like the one man dialogue, but then I got involved.  The author writes well. The ending was surprising.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this representation of the second part of the Phantom's tale. The Australian cast did a fantastic job. Of course, my favorites were Erik the Phantom and Christine Daae.<br /><br />The songs &#34;Beneath a Moonless Sky&#34;, &#34;Beautiful,&#34; &#34;The Phantom Confronts Christine,&#34; and &#34;Love Never Dies&#34; serve as a splendid platform with which to communicate to the audience the passion and love Erik and Christine still feel for each other.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert...) The only thing that was disappointing about the story was Christine's death at the end of the film by the actions of an enraged and disturbed Meg Giry. Though, plot twists at the end of a tale are great points of discussion and serve as thought-provoking reminders that just because an ending may appear to be heading in the fairy tale direction, doesn't necessarily mean they will end up that way.<br /><br />Overall, a great addition to the realm of unrequited love. :)
B000FA675C|5.0|This is perhaps one I the most engaging prestigious books I have ever read ever. In the history of ever.
B004TMPJP6|2.0|I don't like it because when I needed to correct a line, the program wouldn't let me get back to that line and add or correct the item.  In the instance being cited, I misshit the enter bar when I was trying to go back to the last word in the sentence to complete the word, and the program would not let me go back.  That's the last time I've tried it.  For a 79 year old novice, that was a discouraging experience.  I've not tried to use it since.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun to play. Makes you think and is very addictive. Great for kids too. Keeps you on your toes an challenges you.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|The last few years have seen a number of bands from Metallica to Van Halen return to the sound/style that served them well in their prime.  Queensryche is the latest band to pull of this feat on their 2013 eponymous release.  One could argue that Alice in Chains might be a better comparison although it was not death that lead to the need for a new lead singer.  I have to admit that I was skeptical of this latest incarnation with Todd La Torre on lead vocals.  If you have similar reservations, set them aside.  What you are considering is the rightful successor to Empire.  While Promised Land was not a bad CD, it was the beginning of a downward trend.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it.  Queensryche works because it focuses on the basics - a foundation of Eddie Jackson on bass and Scott Rockenfield on drums with Michael Wilton's fine guitar work.  The aforementioned La Torre acquits himself quite well on vocal duty to round out this metal powerhouse.  The songwriting is strong too.  When you hear \\"Redemption\\" speak of \\"corporate stranglehold\\" and other modern issues against the classic Queensryche sound, you know that the boys are back in their groove.  Other strong tracks include the driven \\"Vindication\\" (perhaps the real theme of this album?), the eerie \\"A World Without\\", and the power ballad \\"Open Road\\".<br /><br />Yet, I have one lament for this album.  While I have no problem with the absence of Geoff Tate, I really wish Chris DeGarmo were still around.  He and Wilton formed one of the more formidable guitar duos in all of metal.  Parker Lundgren is no slouch, but the magic on Mindcrime and Empire is somewhat diminished without him.  You could say that this is old news, but it is the one thing I still miss from the old days.<br /><br />In the end, Queensryche is the best album that Queensryche has released in 20 years.  I think old schoolers will find this quite satisfying, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Download this:  \\"Redemption\\"
B008ASGP3U|2.0|Endless descriptions of routes from one place to another became tedious and as for the final solution...... so far fetched and unlikely - not worthy of Mr Rankins's earlier writing.
B008LP8QE8|2.0|Just wanted to comment regarding purchasing on Kindle. It runs so slowly and often precludes using as a reference in class - we're on to another topic before I'm able to look up what the professor is referencing. It is also inconvenient to read on my ipad. I had purchased Katzung's Pharma on Kindle, which I adore, but the formatting here for Harrison's is clunky and hard to manage. Scrolling is a real pain and while in Katzung I can easily manage zooming and magnifying tables and images it is the exact opposite here.<br /><br />Harrison's itself is wonderful - 5 stars<br />Kindle version - 1 star, I suggest finding another format<br />I am rounding down to a 2 for every time it crashed my app.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I love this CD! I have it in my car, and since I seem to spend half my life driving this cd helps save my sanity.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great way to see what other peop0le like. View breathtaking pictures of places you would love to see,  Great for ideas on things you love.  A must have app.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This is a cute and fun game with sane permissions. This is how it should be done. I can't believe how attached I get to saving all the people. It takes a while to develop the necessary skills so it is definitely worthwhile redoing the early levels till you get a perfect score.<br /><br />The game is both challenging and fun which is a hard balance for a game developer to get right but these guys did. Even when you fail it is not so frustrating and irritating that you want to quit. I find myself going over a level multile times because I want to save everyone and am having fun trying.<br /><br />No gore, No in app purchases, no ads, no crazy permissions, just great fun. Way to go Dev's. I'd recommend this game at twice the price.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|When I first saw this movie I have to admit I was confused. I was young and didn't read the book before watching it. Well I finally got around to reading the novel by Frank Herbert; and before U decide to see this movie it might be wise to read the book first. I bought the VHS a long time ago and when I found out about an Extended Cut I had to have it. The Extended Cut is great, why they cut it still doesn't make sense. The Prologue is more detailed and the story is easier to follow, especially for first time viewers. This movie is great, I would recommend it to any film lover, especially sci-fi fans.<br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun challenge for free cant wait for new levels to.come out. you will need to rate the game in order to get new levels.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have enjoyed this author's two previous books.  His writing is as gripping as ever but the various tales seemed disjointed.  I even started to read again thinking I'd missed the connection between some of the chapters.  Even upon a second read I could not weave it all together and understand the significance of some sections.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible gives access to a wide variety of versions, many of which are free. Some of the most popular ones have an additional charge. It gives a verse for the day to assist in your meditation on Scripture, and has a variety of reading plans to assist in regular reading of the Bible throughout the year.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Not just for children. A heartwarming, touching story which was beautifully written. I HIGHLY recommend this book to people of all ages. Many lessens to be learned from this story
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Like then other reviewers have said, it was too short, but so much fun!!!  I look forward to the next chapter.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|After reading through the reviews (so many which were negative) I was pleasantly surprised by this novel.  It was an enjoyable, easy read full of girl drama, suspense, romance, and a bit of mystery.  I would definitely recommend it!
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|If you like Soundgarden you will like this. Old and newer videos its all good the cd's rock too I like it
B0000TB03W|5.0|Love to watch this concert and remember Shania's greatest hits. She was and is so awesome. I love it!! I want to see her be like this again. She needs to comeback to sing with her fantastic style. She's one of the best; no matter if you are fan or not, you going to like it either way!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app! it works great with my phone and my kindle, which is not always the case with these apps
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Kate Morton has a way of drawing you into her thoughts and mind pictures and as I followed her story - I was totally consumed by the story and could not work out how it was going to finally finish.  A must read right up until the end.  Kate Morton is now included as one of my favourite authors.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|love the game its a way t learn about dinosaurs and you get to relive jurassic park<br />so if you love dinosaurs this is the game for you
B009GED3HS|4.0|With the latest season unavailable on Hulu or Netflix or anywhere on CBS's web site, I had to get them from Amazon streaming. This is my first time streaming tv episodes, and I think $2 per episode is a bit much, especially when I've missed 7 episodes, and each is only 30 minutes. Other than price, though, I'm happy with it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoy this game tremendously. Game challenges your skills at solving puzzles and thinking outside the box. I play with my nephew racing to see who solves the game first. Recommend it.
B001NEYO8Q|5.0|One of the classic westerns of ALL time. I can SSwatch this over and over again. Great to see old classics in HD.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|it's a pretty cool game at first but later on u have to pay money to continue the game I say its STUPID ?!???!!?!?!?!?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG...Gideon freakin' rocks my world! And Eva...that woman has independence written all over her now with a capital \\"I\\"!!! I don't know what others were thinking when they gave bad reviews or were upset with the ending...holy crap people...we get 2 more hot, sexy, freakin' amazing books of more Gideon and Eva!!! YES PLEASE! Seriously, Gideon makes me SWOON and Eva makes me love her with the independence she has developed. Thankfully some \\"issues\\" have settled down and Gideon and Eva were able to work more on their relationship. Several instances where I wanted to reach in and smack a character...but that just means the book got to me on an emotional level! I am really curious to see where this series goes, and am very glad that Sylvia's writing has deviated enough from 50 Shades that she has developed her own sexy, crazy story that I just cannot get enough of! Honestly...I am totally crushing on this series and would rank it above \\"50\\". I feel like I get a more raw emotion with the characters and a deeper look into their background. Bring on \\"Captivated by You\\"!!!! A++++ Sylvia :)
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I showed how men who have been deprived of liberty can gain independence in a very strong way . Underlying was a message that men should not give up and continue to pursue a righteous life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|First few escapes are pretty easy, but they are more involved than others like 100 Floors. Very fun. Would like to see more!
B00355L2TU|5.0|Even though it is only 20 minutes, it is a great workout. I love having it around for a quick fix when I can't go running or am to busy to hit the gym.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I love Eric Church.  He has quickly become one of my favorite artists.  I love this album.  What else can I say?
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. Don't get Magic crazy, though, and buy all the unlockable content. If you're patient enough, you don't have to pay for anything.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome series wish I would've read it sooner.  I was hooked from the first few chapters an  couldn't put it down til I was  finished
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It is so beautiful and wonderfully written that I will never forget it, even if I don't reread it, which I very likely will. I will need some time to recover from the emotions engendered in me when I read it. It is the first time I  have felt such a range of emotions and such almost unbearable suspense in a book that is NOT detective fiction.<br /><br />I will not be a spoiler, so I can't say too much, because the book is so vivid now in my heart that it would be easy to spoil it for another reader.  It is the rare kind of book that you want to share with a friend while you are reading it, word by word, page by page.<br /><br />I have bought this book for next to nothing, but for me, now that I have read it, it would be cheap at any price.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book captivated my attention from the very start. It is written is a way that you don't know the real background  of the story until near the end of the book.  It was so interesting that I read it in just a few days.  The book does have some language that would be inappropriate for some people. I liked this book now am interested in seeing the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Never knew what all the hub bub was all about but after now finishing a;ll3 seasons on-line I so get it.  Just a truly excellent show but too many main actors want to leave killing some great story lines......
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I recently were introduced to the Downton Abbey series.  We got hooked with the first episode. I recommend this series.

B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show. I am now addicted to it. I am pushing through Season one and will then watch Season 2. Hopefully there are more great seasons to come.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Truly a captivating program. I would highly recommend for all my friends to watch it. Watch it as a Sunday marathon.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Pretty long and convoluted- unrealistic plot line. Was quite bored half way through to find the ending not very spectacular.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Sorry, but the last few \\"Clancy\\" novels just haven't been up to snuff.  Apparently he's been lending his name to other peoples work because these just aren't the tightly paced page turners that I'd come to expect. If he ever publishes another book that doesn't have a \\"collaborator\\" (yeah, right) I might buy it, but until then the publishers have lost a customer.
0060899220|3.0|After reading this (for free on Kindle lending library) I kind of wish I could have read it 10 years ago.  It's hard to accurately remember the dining culture back then, but in 2013, so much of this seems like old news.  Relative to that time period, everyone is a foodie, you can't even go to an Applebee's without someone instagraming there chicken tenders.  Forget about the food network and the travel channel, food prep has even invaded prime time, celebrity chefs are household names, and food blogs are not for insiders in the least.  Don't eat seafood on mondays, don't go to brunch, never get the specials, yeah yeah, this isn't inside baseball anymore.<br /><br />All that being said, Bourdain is a born storyteller, if only a little long winded.  Several hundred pages seemed to be a bit too much padding, especially given the uneven editing and timeline.  And what is it about food stories that almost require that mystical magical Japanese hole in the wall where sake and seafood delights abound.  Some chapters are straight up chronological autobio, some are tips for eating out, some for cooking in.<br /><br />For full disclosure if crude language bothers you don't read this, kitchens are notoriously crude settings.
B007SGM084|4.0|Good,somewhat  repetitive novel but Altogether an enjoyable read. It was nice to be able to purchase all three volumes in one from Amazon.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|If you are fearful of your current life, busy but heading nowhere, confused and confounded by what is next, this book will truly teach you the ONE Thing you need…how to the about the ONE Big Thing and simplify the ONE Small Thing to get you going down the right path.
B004KWVDWI|5.0|this is steve mcqueens best movie that he was ever in its a great movie to watch any time you want to dustin hoffman is also very good in this movie if you are a steve mcqueen fan you will love this movie.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Walking Dead has made me into a curious zombie fan. So when six months back they started showin world war z trailers at the movies, they had my attention.<br /><br />I decided I will give the book a flirt but as often happens before I could get around to reading it, the film was playing and after such a bam bam trailer I decided to just go watch it. My friend accompanied me because she had heard it has shots of Glasgow, a place she used to live. She hates zombie genre otherwise. She had never seen the trailer. So the film ended and I said hmmmm.. Why did they have such an underwhelming use of 3d glasses? If you want to do 3d, do it like life of pi and great gatsby or else don't do it.<br /><br />Not bad. But come on its 2013, this film cost so much and this is all the director really made? This one will not make it to anyone's top 5 films of the year list, I pray it is not this underwhelming a year.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is alright. We have come to understand he is doing safe roles and wearing his personality down. It is almost as if the actor expects you to know him from before the start of the film. A great actor is supposed to create an impression of new ness with every single film. I like Pitt but the problem with him is he is too jaded and formulaic at times. That said, I liked him in last years killing them softly but anyway world war z should have been more than just what it's sum really was.<br /><br />Irrespective of what I would have heard I would have wanted to watch it. I hear there will be a sequel, we will see if it is more intense.<br /><br />Some film makers forget that the person watching the film may be confused because they have not read the book. They should know how to slow the pace down without boring us. This is not a bad film, just too safe and overall, not something I would hold in a heavy opinion.
B00004XONN|5.0|Everything that makes me love Radiohead, and a few hits too. Catchy, obsessive themes with a hint of depressive energy. Anyone?
B000FC1MCS|3.0|I'm really not sure what I think about this book. It's definitely a easy read but not sure it's realistic and knowing about autistic kids this doesn't really fit. But it was a good change and different. I feel really bad for the father.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|Fun, innovative, in the manner of Yo Yo Ma, this CD is a real delight. Unconventional scenery, musical plots, strange electronic instruments, talented musicians, great compositions, what's not to like.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I don't want to give away too much here...overall I was happy with this book and the end of the series. A little bit sad because I love Sookie, but I know that all stories have to come to an end. I enjoyed having some characters from the past come back (Barry, Quinn, etc.), and I do think she could have done a little more with them (i.e. Sookie & Quinn--the attraction is there--why not hook up again?). I'm not surprised with who Sookie ended up with in the end, but I was a little disappointed with the last couple of pages--I think Sookie should have given in to her impulses and not spend the night alone.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Very Funny and very real. I love the different perspectives whether planned or unexpected, easy or difficult, or experienced in other ways. I enjoyed it all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is great. It's fun and the mini games don't take too long, but best of all the game is free!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i love this series. its amazing and im glad that i got the chance to read it. I really think its a good book
B004TI1WME|1.0|no directions so i was not sure how to delete items and i found it hard to find my list
B00899ES5C|5.0|I chose this because its a pretty amazing show and i love watching it. I could watch it all the time
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Day-Lewis has brought Lincoln to life. What a powerful movie, a must see for everyone. Should be shown in High School History classes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because its a really good book and its worth reading. I think anyone would like it
B0096DZKZC|5.0|The best platformer game for Kindle hands down, so if you like classic 2d games where u run around and jump from platform to platform get this game!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Well worth the time.  So well written and engrossing.  You won't expect some of the twist and turns.  Don't miss it.
B000I62JBE|4.0|This movie was Great! I watched iron my iPad and it held my attention throughout, suspenseful, good plot and great acting.
B00821OX98|5.0|Higher quality aliens thna usually seen on TV productions, great directing, production values, cast and good acting.  The script gets a bit smarmy.  We've begun to yell &#34;drink!&#34; every time something trite or predictable is said, but the cast and directing make up for it most of the time.  It's also nice to see a series really think through all of the different political/societal issues--it's made me think.  We blew through this season and are on to the second.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I read this ebook while on vacation and it was great.  It was inspirational and concise.  I had started reading the Miss Minimalist blogs recently but appreciated having them all in one place to go through quickly.  I find myself going back through certain reference books to get key pieces of information and the fact that this one is compact makes it perfect for future browsing.  I appreciated the price, which I deemed fair considering how conveniently packaged the content was.  I have been downsizing my clutter over the last year and this was a perfect perk to keep me motivated and offer additional reasons why living with less is truly more.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun but some things boring<br />They could have made the comp petitions a lot more fun all you do is push one button instead off doing something
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I honestly didn't think we would ever see anything of quality from the guys in Queensryche ever again.  I used to be this band's biggest fan, but after a series of dud albums after their last great one (Promised Land), I gave the band up for dead.<br /><br />This album is a 100% return to form, and is the peer of Empire/Promised Land in every way.  And that is really, really high praise. The new lead singer is a perfect replacement for Geoff Tate, who I personally blame for the lack of interesting music coming out of that band since DeGarmo left.<br /><br />Well done!  Now bring on the tour!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game for all ages. It passes time and its fun! I recommend it for everyone.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is a genuine Nintendo Brand White Gamecube Controller, the last ones that were ever made. These GC controllers were briefly re-released in White during the launch of the Nintendo Wii, which sported backwards compatibility with Gamecube games. These are not only very high quality but also have a longer cord than original GC controllers. Other than that minor improvement, they are physically identical to the controllers you would buy with a Gamecube back in 2001. Many vendors and ebay sellers offer look-alike knockoff controllers for a much cheaper price. However, I recommend you pay the extra money for the real deal. Compared to my old Silver and Black controllers which have become worn over the years, this one feels fresh and is visually appealing.  These controllers are becoming increasingly rare, so I'd recommend you grab one ASAP, especially if you're  into competitive Super Smash Bros or just want to play some good old Gamecube games.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|I thought this movie was okay.  I like Mark W as actor, but this movie didn't have much umpf to it.  There were some exciting parts, but overall the movie was just okay.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great Show!  I wanted to make certain that I hadn't missed anything and to refresh my memory after the break.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Good stuff, though I wish it were cleaner. If you skip past the \\"Master of the House\\" bit you miss large portion of vulgarity. As far as quality: Jackman does a great job, my second favorite moment being his repentance-really good stuff. He is solid through the entire film.  The amazing performance here, though, is Ann Hathaway.  Her version of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" blows away all others that I've heard.  I annoys me that some are looking for some phony, perfectionist vocal performance; Ann conveys more than a series of notes but becomes a revelation.  In doing outreach ministry for years I've seen the Fantine's, broken, loosening their weakened grip on the foolish dream they had dreamed that is now shame.  I've seen their hollow eyes and heard their sadness.  Before surrendering my own heart to Christ I was quickly approaching the bottom myself....if not for the intervening mercy of God--Christ, His salvation--I would be singing Fantine's song. What a mighty Lord to rescue the lowest sinners. When I listen to Ann in her performance, I know she is singing the song of so many that live as a broken thing...she tells their story and communicates their pain.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Epic is the best,movie wise and game wise if you haven't played this game YOU NEED TO PLAY IT like NOW
B0085YOD1A|4.0|But I ended up continuing to use the one that came with the phone. Trivial stuff, but I didn't like the fact that there was a number on the left hand top part of my screen. I would rather have the % sign added so 94% instead of 94. As I said, trivial, but I didn't like just the number.
B008GJV0ZG|4.0|We got this movie for weekend evening. It is well made and my kids 7yrs old enjoyed it very much.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Omg this had me laughing so hard my husband made me read him some pages and he was laughing too  I love the mans view very hilarious to read ... A must read
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|The web pages a a bit difficult to navigate and it is not as user friendly as I would like.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|This is one of the best action figure that I seen, and I was looking this for long time. The finishes are better than other figures like the McFarlane's Toys. Very good articulation points and the stand is great to put Samus in many aerial poses.<br /><br />If you like Metroid and specially Samus Aran, this is the action figure you should buy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First book in a while that I was totally engrossed in...a real page turner. A very enjoyable read. Highly recommend.
B00160FBWK|5.0|Aliens, the second movie in the series, is one of my favorite movies, especially in this genre. There are now frequent imitators, but Aliens was first to combine science fiction, horror, and action. I've watched it numerous times over the years. My generation will get an Aliens movie quote instantly. I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />This is the first movie I have purchased in digital format from Amazon. So far, no problems.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. It is a longer game that kept me guessing, only thing I have to complain about was that you have to double tap to get to any place. Got annoying after a while.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great Flick, I have recomended it to friends and family, not a waste of time good entertainment should have won more awards
B006XF5BTG|5.0|A lot of what Michael discusses here is relatively common knowledge, but he follows up every recommendation with studies backing the finding. In some cases there aren't studies, but just what he has found over his years of training. The biggest benefit I got out of this book was understanding the best rep range and why, when to do cardio and what kind of cardio to do, and macro counting tips for cutting and bulking. It's quick read packed with helpful tips, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to get into fitness training, even those that have been at it for year like myself.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This  can  is the bomb it is truly fantastic I would  only recommended it for 12+ because  of the details. But over all I say keep it coming gameloft.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I always wish these books were longer! I love her writing. I am an Arkansas girl myself so it's an easy read for me :) I didn't know if I liked Sookie's new love interest. I was such a big fan of Eric, but in the end I agreed with the choice. Maybe Sookie can have a more normal life now. Haha yea right!! Loved this book!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Its early in the morning and I really don't want to be writing reviews, so. ..... I loved it all the songs were terrific,good style,played well together and it is a classic music making group. Try it you can't lose.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I am a huge fan of comic-book/superhero shows and movies. This has all the action and adventure that I love. I can't wait for season 2!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Good for Children; even Greater for Adults and 3-D is incredible.  This is a movie, not only for Christmas time, but all year round as well.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|This movie is awful. Talk about a let down. This movie seems to be a throw back to when there was NO CGI ..... Maybe they wanted to it to be a flop=/
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed this game but it was really short. I'm hoping it won't take too long for new levels. They are just the right amount of puzzle and frustration and fun.  Not too difficult at all.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The disc was not playable in my power dvd. I think its due to something new encoding tht only future players may support. Many people are having the same issue. I got full refund for the same. Nice seller. Thank your.
B00004XQ83|4.0|If you have seen the movie, you'll apprecate this CD.  Goes a bit beyond the score from the movie and rounds out a collection.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Dr. Hannibal Lector is the most sublime, unadulterated manifestation of the darkness endemic to the human condition; he is the perfect devil-on-the-shoulder.<br /><br />The show is a work of art: in terms of the writing and acting, of course - but visually, as well. The show's stylist is the most aesthetically-inclined individual, as evidenced by the impeccable wardrobe of not just Hannibal, but all other characters, too. I daresay even if every other aspect of this show was abhorrent, I would still watch it religiously just to see beautiful ensembles Hannibal wears. In fact, Dr. Lector inspired me to add paisley to my tie repertoire.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Just what I needed for a good laugh. Tina's descriptions of her experiences as a mother really resonated with my own experiences.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|You can't out do the original Wizard of Oz, it a timeless classic. But this did help us understand how the Wizard came to live in Oz. I was overly impressed with the Witches but the Monkey that follows Oz around made the show better.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love it I can check my email whenever I want, as long as I have wifi. Keeping intouch with family and friends on the go.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I was really impressed by Barbara Streisand the most, I didn't remember how good a actress she was, she kind of stole the show.
B0010WFGGA|4.0|The same rhythmic tunes of the doctor along with some new songs all slightly modernized yet with the same blissful feel!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|My Wife would say  it was good, I thought the plot was horrible and not over thought out, not impressed with this movie.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Victoria is not an easy child to love. In fact, the other abandoned girls around her are afraid of her, often with good reason. An angry product of the foster care system, she had become virtually unplaceable until the extraordinary compassion and loving skill of foster mom Elizabeth give her a voice through the lost language of flower messages. Through this miracle of psychology, Victoria is finally able to release a lifetime of pent up emotions. Angry thoughts such as &#34;You abandoned me&#34;,  &#34;your hurt me&#34;, and &#34;I hate you&#34;, expressed by the giving of nettles, thistles and cactus, are soon replaced with flowers of beauty relaying messages of acceptance, trust and hope and eventually love and forgiveness.<br /><br />Through The Language of Flowers, Diffenbaug examines the jumbled thoughts of the lost child and offers the belief that even the most desperate can sometimes still be reached. It is good lesson in patience  and versatility for the most frustrated parent of an adopted or fostered child with detachment issues, or even your own disassociated wild teen you no longer know how to reach.<br /><br />A great lesson in what to do, and what not to do as a parent.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I found this book to be an enjoyable read, It kept me interested and made you feel you knew the people in the story I would recommend the book as a good read
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|There's nothing more I can say other than brilliant!!<br />Brilliantly shot<br />Brilliantly acted<br />Brilliant displayed<br />Brilliantly thought<br />Brilliantly plotted<br />Brilliantly casted<br />Brilliant designed
B00AB55BS0|5.0|This show is astounding. I've gotten numerous family and friends hooked on to the show. Quite possibly the best show on TV right now.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|So fun and intriguing!!! Love these kind of interactive puzzles games. Being out of the office and a stay at home mom; this game keeps my brain exercised!! Love this game and can't wait for more rooms to explore and unlock!!
0345529057|5.0|I'm just about done reading through this box set, and I'm amazed at George R.R. Martin's writing. This story is the most intrigued I've been in books for the longest time. Definitely a great read.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Weather channel for Android holds its own against  iPad competition.cold in all respects.seven more words is going overboard..I like it just fine.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show is astounding. I've gotten numerous family and friends hooked on to the show. Quite possibly the best show on TV right now.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|Easy to use. Intuitive..Like display of the calculation process. Large display welcome. What more can  be said.Best of all is the price.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|My mother loved this movie. Don't know what else to say. I bought it for her. So that's about it.
B001R6AW18|5.0|It is what it is. Looks great. The Harryhausen commentary is required listening. The recreated 'spider' sequence is extremely creepy.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Easy viewing of pictures so you know what your snapping pics of, I'm a Professional Photographer and I must say the gopro is my goto camera for intense, underwater filming and its nice to be able to go back and view pics and videos on the spot. Just make sure to pick up spare batteries.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Total Classy Production from start to finish.The actors are wonderful, the script perfect, the scenery gorgeous, the sets right on the money.  I watch it regularly with my girlfriend.  We try to see 3 episodes at a time because we found it late.  Get On Board.<br />Howard
B00B7Y0206|2.0|When I first opened it,I thought that it was going to work. But when I tried to watch a video,it just kept on loading,and my device asked me if I wanted to close the app,so I closed the app,and deleted it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Recommended by a friend. My kids really enjoy it! Easy to use and you can disable the in app purchases so they don't buy anything without you knowing!
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia can be considered the ultimate collection of artwork relating The Legend of Zelda videogame series. Any Zelda fan will be immersed in youth memories, as if they came from ancient times. Many stories to remember, many details to discover, many secrets to reveal. A sense of joyful thankfulness from the book's very first page, to its final drawing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addictive and fun game.  Well worth the free price.  The weekly and daily challenges are a nice addition.to the game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was so glad to find a calculator app to put on my Kindle Fire.  I am sure I will use this alot since I have calculators in just about everyroom.
0770437400|5.0|This novel is really absorbing. Not so much about zombies as it is about how the world's governments, militaries, and peoples would deal with a threat to the entire globe. Parts are scary, parts are exciting, others are emotional. A really good read.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What's not to like about this app.  I need to know the weather before I leave and when I'm on go with my Kindle Fire.
B0062QRTKA|3.0|For some reason this version is only 1.1 while Google Play is up to 2.1.2. I guess you can complain to the development team about not updating the Amazon version.<br /><br />Because of that I would suggest getting it on Google Play instead. More levels and bug fixes.<br /><br />As to the game I love it and paid for it on day 1 when I got my Nexus 7.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|I took a look at this game and could not figure out what to do or not do.  This game is not like any other game because it does not come with instructions like many other games.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love the show, love having the first season.  I like being able to watch the shows in order.  Would definitely recommend.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I don't recommend any game that does not come with directions or instructions or even a sample display of how the game is to be played as well as how to win.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love the show, love having the second season.  I like being able to watch the shows in order.  Would definitely recommend.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|My daughter and I couldn't put it down til we finished it, her on one kindle I on another lol
B0062QRTKA|4.0|In reading the reviews, I found such a defensive undertone all for a simple yet cute game. This game does have a religious theme which I cant understand why people would act repelled as if they were satanist. The game doesnt use the names of biblical characters, nor does it follow any storyline from the old testament. Its just a simple game that if you changed the people into animals and the water into cars, you would have the same game as played here. I rather have religious items verses pornographic or devient characters.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The last 60 or so pages seem to nit fit the book, almost as if Suzanne was trying to just end it because it needed to end. I loved the book up til about that time just because she didn't end it smoothly I give it 3 stars.
B003UESJJC|5.0|EXCELLENT BLURAY! THE PICTURE QUALITY IS BRAND NEW, HOWEVER, EXCEPT THE BOOKLET IS WITH NEW IDEAS, AND A FEW SMALL BONUS FEATURES,  THE DISCS REMAINS ALMOST THE SAME MATERIALS FROM THE DVD EDITION.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book is awesome. Its part of one of my favourite series ever. The characters are awesome. Thank you Rick Riordan!
B000BRBGO6|5.0|EXCELLENT VINYL! BRAND NEW, AND IT IS ALSO MADONNA'S MASTERPIECE! A MUST-HAVE AS THE BEST DANCE ALBUM IN THE 2000S!
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|If I had to sum up the record in one word I would say it was \\"forced\\". Rubin has admitted to challenging them to recapture the sound of the first couple of Sabbath records but he didn't seem to understand that wasn't available to them.<br /><br />Iommi hasn't written in that style in years and Ozzy's solo stuff took him into an entirely different direction which ultimately led to mediocrity. As such, neither of them were prepared or able to recapture the old sound. So, they basically came up with a slate of uninspired stuff that sounds like a crude forgery of what they once were.<br /><br />There are plenty of copycat songs based on earlier tunes that were far superior. This technique has been employed by Maiden, Priest and many other metal bands whose best songs are behind them. The playing is perfunctory, it offers no excitement. The music is boring because it sounds like they were bored recording it.<br /><br />I don't know why people think Rick Rubin is a great producer. His mixes are generally second rate at best and his musical direction is often misguided. He should have let the band do whatever they were feeling NOW, not tried to force them back into a mindset they have long since abandoned.<br /><br />I am sure the fact Tony was feeling under the weather didn't help. How do you tell a legend who is fighting for his life his ideas sound uninspired? Well, they fulfilled their contractual obligations. They put out some songs and will now do the tour. Sadly this is not the way a great band should end their career but it seems like most of them do end this way nonetheless.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|My son and I like science/math based suspense movies and we weren't sure what Pi was about so we gave it a shot. I stayed glued to the TV but was wondering the entire time what the heck we were watching.... it was very interesting and made us discuss but now, days later I am still trying to follow the concept of the film. Strange. Odd.... but good.
B009NX61JY|4.0|I'd never seen this movie and I enjoyed it very much. Two damaged people (is there any other kind?) come together and start to build a life together,
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This os an addictive hale. Love playing tournament blackout and Atlantic city. Does not require u to spend money. Awesome
0525478817|4.0|At first, the lead characters' lexicon was annoying; too affected, too aloof, too world-weary, and too many one-word sentences. But then two things happened: 1. I realized that all teenagers have a language of their own that us geezers frequently find, like, annoying, and 2. I talked with a nurse who works with terminally ill kids and she told me most of them are wise beyond their years. So I stuck with it, and it paid off. Yes, there's a lot of dorm-room philosophizing, but the ring of truth still comes through, and the writer has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to keep the reader engaged. If you read it, keep in mind that it's written for teens and judge accordingly.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love the setting. The mansion is enticing. I enjoy viewing the clothing, and  the story line is captivating. It is so entertaining.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging but fun.  some levels are harder than others but it passes the time when I am travelling on a plane.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game. Passes the time away. Different levels go choose from.  Clicks sound when you turn or move a card and has undo button for when you make that mistake. Yes there ads but it's free so expect it unless you upgrade and pay for app and they only come between games.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|As I glance over the reviews posted already it's clear song-by-song breakdowns aren't needed in mine. For the first time since Mindcrime there's an album that Queensryche fans can get truly excited over. I loved Empire & Promised Land, but Mindcrime, for me, was the bookmark of an outstanding band where every song stood above the line of acceptable. This new CD does exactly that once more, and everything from instrument sounds, song mix, writing and vocals contribute. Killer playing. Stellar singing. Songs crafted to be great instead of a showcase for any single member. And most importantly, the flow of this album is amazing. There are no hiccups that make you wonder where that came from. It's what most Queensryche fans have been pleading for, and whether or not you miss Geoff Tate, this album will floor you. The live bonus cuts are icing on the cake, and all 3 sound like they did when I saw the band originally on the Warning tour. I'm a very happy QR fan today.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie since the first time came out and my kids their in love with the minions, so do i lol.
0439023513|5.0|This series has not once disappointed me. I was crying like a baby at the end of this book but I loved it none the less. All the characters became close friends to me through out this journey and it is sad to see it end. Their emotions were so life like. You felt their pains and sorrows and could sympathize with them. There is no straight answer to tell you why this is such a great series and I am not even sure myself why it is great. All I know is that for those of you who have not read it drop what your are doing. Go get it. Read it now.
0375869026|5.0|Read the book for a family book club...ages 11-52, we all had alot to contribute to the conversation. The questions were made up by the 11 year old, she did get alot out of the story
0439023521|5.0|I started this book with very high expectations since every review I have read and even heard of sang it praises. Now that I am finished all I can think is: Oh...my...freaking...gosh. I think I love this book. It lived up to and surpassed my expectations! Action packed in every sense of the words it is all about survival and the emotional after effects. It has a love story but none of those gushy instantaneous love situations. You can clearly see it concerns relationships forged by time and trials. I will definitely be reading \\"Catching Fire\\" as soon as possible.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Jack the Giant Slayer had a lot of good action and a somewhat believable story to back it up for you.
0545586178|5.0|Once again this series has left me with that awe inspiring, Oh-my-freaking-gosh feeling! There was no let downs about this book, it only kept getting better. Perhaps my favorite thing about Catching Fire is that there are no warnings. Nothing is really pointed out to you until 'WHAM' your hit with a twist you never saw coming but explains so much about certain actions. The cliffhanger you are left with at the end if this book is one of the best I have seen in a long time.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|It seems like an imitation of the X files built around a single conspiracy whereas the X files was more diverse in its plots<br />It is entertaining but the X files were better and more thought provoking. The portrayal of the somewhat mad scientist by John Noble is super and stands out from the other mostly pedestrian performances. Lance Reddick doesn't come close the fire and intensity he achieved in The Wire
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm really enjoying this series. I can now understand why everyone loves it so much. Thanks for having it on Amazon Prime Instant Videos.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written.  Stirs up a lot of emotions.  I enjoyed how the author told the story through multiple characters.  Great read!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|great story line for the whole family. my family just loves it! science fiction at it's best! I hope it just keeps getting better.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|The original one i had broke, this one caem in sooner than expected which is a plus. plugged in the cable and it works great!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this App. It is so much fun finding the clues. I play with my 7yo granddaughter. More rooms please. I hope it will not take too long. I need my fix of Escape!!!
B003L77GRO|5.0|Can't wait until I can get season 6 to see what happens next! The suspense is just short of killing me!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|awesome love this app<br />it has several choices for feeding a great training activity's and competeing is super fun I reccomend it<br />its graphics are awsome
B005K17RU0|3.0|This is a good app for a quick and detailed check of the weather for home and my other favorite places.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love can you escape it is challenging and fun it is scarey I like finding hidden objects and opening things
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addictive but too bad there are cheats on you tube 8( otherwise it's overall fun to play and a free time filler.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|I thought this was an excellent book which really did give a first hand of the Navy Seal Mission featured in the title. However it also went further than that by outlining and describing the lifestyle and training of the Seals. I felt that readers who have different political outlooks could still read this book and take something from it. Definitely would recommend for anyone with an interest in the military however.
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|Perhaps Andre and his orchestra are a their best when performing in their hometown of Maastricht, The Netherlands in the Province of Limburg.  Andre is a hometown sensation, as well being an international star, but I think if you would ask him, he is proud to call himself a Maastricht native from Limburg Province.  They shine in this performance.  A must have for any Andre Rieu fan.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|The new Sabbath album is AWESOME!!!! Every track has that same old Black Sabbath feel and sound. It's like they never broke stride and put out their next album with Ozzy on the mic. A must have for any metal fan!!! Sabbath is BACK!!!!!!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|So I have the first generation kindle fire and with it, I've had some trouble knowing if my kindle was actually charging (the green light wouldn't show after charging it). After plugging and wiggle'n it so much and being afraid I would brake it all together, I read somewhere online to download this app. Once you download it, and plug it in, it will tell you if its charging or not, and what the percentage is on the battery. This is a lifesaver for anyone who struggles keeping their kindle charged.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This product is an excellent mouse, I don't have any problems with its size even that I have big hands this mouse fits perfectly with my hands, the buttons on the left side are perfect for the games that I play.<br />It's a great product and the prize is very low for this great quality. I recommend this mouse to anyone that wants a great experience playing games or in the daily use of the office or any use.
0439882826|5.0|My five and one-half year old grandson just loves this Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy.<br />It gives him all the information he is constantly wanting to know about each character,<br />the starship and more...couldn't have been a better present.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|After this reading this book I felt like I needed to do more.  I wanted to be a better American, spouse, parent and Christian.  His wife shows what love and committment are all about.  You can't read his story and not be moved.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on kindle! I enjoy this game. Glad it is on the kindle. Glad it also works off line for awhile.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The kids like it and find it fun.  They are playing it a . Lot because they want to own<br />the zebra and the unicorns
0060936223|5.0|I thought it was an honest and human account of a relationship and the struggles achievements and passions they went through for love and the love of art
3899554698|4.0|I think it will make a good gift for a 9th grader. I love giving books so this looks like a good choice!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show full of twist and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat and smiling cant wait to see what they do next
0500516766|5.0|how things are built, made, put together. I am certain he will love this book! I do and it is not normally the sort of book I would think was interesting. But the layout and photography are compelling and the book drew me in.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Purchased this for my Synology 1512+ NAS to upgrade it from 1G to 2GB.  Works great.  I did not see any improvement in performance but I wasn't having issues before.  I doubt I needed it, but I just have a hard time thinking of a system with only 1GB RAM when even my cell phone has 2GB RAM.
0307460444|5.0|GREAT  EASY TO REPLICATE CUPCAKES & IDEAS !  I MADE THE BUTTERMILK CUPPYS & RECEIVED A SMALL JOB FROM THEM :)  THANKS MARTHA !!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is an awesome game. you get to clean the stables an compete in horse races. I like it because it is fast and easy to use.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Shipping was prompt. CD was new, perfect. The music of daft punk is great! i love them and hope to see them live soon ;)
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|The movie was awesome! Its like the hidden details of the story we read or was told to us. I recommend this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is amazing fun and very exciting game. It allows you to be different characters, boards+ and even scenes.  Get the game.<br /> [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B009O2XY12|4.0|Pretty fun! This game is pretty similar to Bubble worlds. It is pretty fun, but again somewhat repititious. Still it is a good game
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|too difficult for kids under 5. and always has to &quot;connect to server &quot; but it is fun for adults to play
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|7 and 3 year old daughters love this movie and can't wait for the new one to be released this summer.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|With lean prose the narrative expresses immeasurable sadness.<br />I wish that I will soon be able to read a same kind of book.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I haven't used this mic much, yet, but so far it has a great sound. It is loud and projects the voice out front of the music. For 25 bucks I don't think you can beat it. I'm happy so far. I may buy some more of them. It is not \\"too short\\" as one reviewer complained. It is a standard length just like the SM-58.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game for any age if you like horses. Keeps my interest and the graphics help in making this a very good experience.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love this whole series. It is a guilty pleasure. Like a soap opera, sure a little trashy, but highly addictive.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|It lists tracks in order and automatically starts the next track. The file names are shown so I can see which file I want to play.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really have enjoyed reading this series. It actually is a guilty addiction, a soap opera in print if you will, and I sometimes have ignored my kids just to finish a book or I have stayed up way too late finishing a book or chapter and am a little grumpy the next day because of it. I had to cut myself off after the 3rd book so I could reenter real life and participate with that for a while before I dive back into indulging in the last two books.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|While Queensrÿche has never failed to impress me at a live performance, their studio efforts have been declining since the mid 90's.  With the 2012 dismissal of Geoff Tate, the band has taken a decided step in the right direction... BACK to their roots.  The 2013 eponymous album, \\"Queensrÿche\\" is simply awesome.  The intro and opening tracks \\"X2\\" and \\"Where Dreams Go To Die\\" start off with \\"So here we are again...\\" and the listener is reminded of where Queensrÿche could have been musically without the push towards theatric lounge music by Geoff Tate over the past 15 years or more.  \\"A World Without\\" is a powerfully dark song about a man who loses the wife he loves during the birth of their child.  \\"In This Light\\" and \\"Open Road\\" are also very strong tracks that can only be described as works evolved from the foundations of \\"Rage For Order\\", \\"Empire\\", and \\"Promised Land\\".<br /><br />If Geoff Tate was the heart of Queensrÿche, then Todd La Torre is the much needed heart transplant that has revived and revitalized these progressive metal icons.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I loved this show when it ran on TV.  Package was as I expected but have not had time to watch it yet.
B00BW0QC8G|5.0|I have owned several other Case Logic products in the past, always impressed with the quality of construction and appearance.  This is not a letdown.  My Kindle Fire, HP laptop, power supply and books fit easily as does my brown bag lunch.  The shoulder straps are very comfortable, they are padded very well along with the backside of the pack.  Comfortable even with heaver weight. I've had so many el cheapo backpacks that I really appreciate the comfort of this one.  The zippers are heavy duty, carry handles both on the top and bottom, has a strap for hanging on a hook and adjustments for everything.  Nice compartment for I-tunes with a provision for the cord to go through the case while the player is secure inside.  Place for your smartphone, if you are lucky enough to have one, I don't.  Just trying to make the point that there is a compartment for everything electronic that you pack around with room to spare with plenty of cushioning to protect your equipment----and lunch!  Can't think of a thing to fault this great Backpack!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This boom made my heart stop a couple of times I can't believe what has happened in this book I almost cried cause I thought peeta died
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This story line kept me enthralled.  The twists were surprising but believable!  The description put me inside the garden and the estate. The characters believable and interesting.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|I am not a huge action movie fan. However this movie has a great plot for people like me that need a story line to follow, and a lot of great action and explosions for people like my fiancé who will watch a movie that has no plot just to watch stuff blow up. It's a great all around movie.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|This book held my attention and the characters drew me into their life's.  I would definitely recommend this author's books.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|This game worked fine until it started crashing every time it is opened. Ease fix this bug. Soon people will stop playing just because it crashes so much on startup.....
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Being a history buff, I love stories from different periods.  The characters are true to life and the story line keeps you focused.
1423431391|5.0|This book is in very good condition it is in almost new condition minus the stuff on the cover. It will come in use to me.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This story kept me enthralled. The characters and descriptions are typical of this author.  I await further books from this author.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have now read up to the end of Third Shift and am eagerly awaiting the next installment.Wonderful characters and a plot line that has you on the edge of your seat.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|The excellent acting and the characters' relationships keep you coming back... for more obscure details of episodic lawyer fodder. Layers constantly keeping secrets from one another, alternating between helping each other and screwing each other over, often looking good in fancy clothing... You know... They wear fancy...&#34;Suits&#34;.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|The acting was lousy. I expected more from Franco. I guess if I were 5 or younger, I would have gotten into it. There are a few things I do not understand.<br />1. Finley was a good flying monkey. I noticed he wore the same clothes as the evil monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. So, after most of the evil monkeys were put to sleep in the poppy fields, did Finley go bad, and  go over to the Witch's side? Speaking of Finley, where were all the other Finleys?<br />2. When Dorothy, and the others were walking through the poppy fields, would they have not seen the flying monkeys sleeping? or, at least some remnant of them being stopped there?<br />This movie was so loosely based on the Wizard of Oz that it should NOT have had any reference to it at all.<br />I think the actors just saw this as a paycheck between other projects.
B008I34XUY|5.0|Apostrophe (') is Zappa at his best as a composer, band leader, musician and story teller. Can't go wrong with this one.
6305428557|4.0|Good story line with amuzing characters.  I have some Welsh blood somewhere in me and recall older relatives' stories about the old country.  This flick brought those stories back to mind.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|no buffering or stalling. good quality picture and sound. Had to keep the controller near by for volume adjustment though.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|This is the best option over fixed-Joint elbow adaptors.<br /><br />Even if you don't need a cable to sit 90 degrees in a tight spot in a cabinet or wherever, this will keep the stress off your digital port by allowing the cable to lay or sit in the most relax position as possible.<br /><br />I haven't had any problems with loose wires or it wearing out.  My adaptor has been a solid purchase and I would like to buy more.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|This is a great show. It manages to get you hooked very quickly due to seeing the human race in such a desperate situation. I like seeing environments of complete abandonment of cities due to world catastrophes and such. Besides that, the main character is probably the strongest cast in the show. He gets you to build a strong link with him quickly. The only things I could point out that could be done better are some of the special effects on the big metal robot aliens, and a few of the actors are really out of their league in the show. This could be due to the increasing number of other high quality shows I watch from HBO, AMC, Showtime, etc. But first time I watch a network show of this type, and I am definitely a fan. Cant wait to finish season 2 and catch up with season 3 now playing on TV. ENJOY!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am a huge Pretty Little Liars fan! Season 3 definitely did not disappoint! It left me wanting more! So excited for Season 4!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|While I'm not that great at driving games, this one sure kept me trying. Lots of fun and awesome graphics...loving it!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Conan-Doyle is first rate in both science fiction and mystery. I would say he is the father of both genres. To read the original Sherlock Holmes stories is to see a quite different Holmes than is seen in the movies and TV.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|This film was nice and had beautiful music, but they put my wife and I asleep.  We even missed the much  awaited final act.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Although I have never been too good at &#34;driving&#34; type games I still find the one really difficult. In fact I just can't get the hang of it at all. There are some really banged up trees and fences in Pac-Man Land.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I enjoyed this and all of Bruce Willis Die Hard movies. The lyrical wit is always on point and action shown throughout.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|A mystery is solved and a world of class is made known. Very interesting. With some conventional plot twists.<br />Recommended.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Good story line. Great lesson - you can make a ton of money stripping - just don't get too greedy. Don't let your temple get ruined with too much fun.
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|A fantastic CD and monster guitar player...I'm just wondering why it took me so long to find Steve Lukather. His skills far outweigh those of Clapton, Hendrix, and SRV just to name a few...IMHO.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Knocked out of the ball park, this movie has exceeded all my expectations and was action packed.  Emotional and alive, the movie leaves the audience with feelings of suspense.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved the book! I couldn't put it down!  I can't wait to read &#34;Walking Disaster&#34;. I can't get enough of their love.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|It's a classic. So I am started my 3 year old Grandson with the original. He loved it. He loved watching the action with all of the different characters.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|A must get if u like mtg it is very good the only down side is u have to pay 9.99 for the full game but it is a good game
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The first half of this book was very engaging... and second half felt like it was all about his trying to convince us that it was real.  I would never argue with anyone who is convinced of his experience, but I do believe Alexander believes he was in Heaven.
B0090O07RS|1.0|I lost it. Somewhere between my office and home which is 100 feet apart I cant find the video. I will look some more and probably buy another
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Provides a great deal of insight and understanding into the world of Navy SEALS and some of the defenders of OUR great nation. An unfortunate tragedy turned into a great memorial for fallen comrades. Thank You Marcus Luttrell for sharing what had to be the most difficult situation to live through...and my best to your family and teammates...Godspeed!
B00847KFDS|4.0|great new songs. I like the idea of the duets. overall I think it was well worth it. I am a big fan
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really cute game. My daughter loves it and thinks feeding the horses is cool. She can't wait to get a unicorn. I really recommend it for kids.
B00CA4S3UI|5.0|Magnus Karlsson can do no wrong!!! I have followed him through his many projects,  Allen/Lande being some of my favorite.  It seems like he always makes others shine with his amazing writing and playing.  When I heard about this one I was excited but I didn't want to expect too much and be let down.<br /><br />Holy crap!<br /><br />When I heard there was going to be a bunch of singers I thought....meh ....usually I only end up liking a few and it ends up a deal breaker.  I read reviews that said it seems like he wrote these songs for each person specifically and WOW,  that's exactly how it sounds!  Every track rocks, even Magnus shows off his vocal chops!<br /><br />His guitar work amazes me.  It rocks,  it soars with passion and emotion, it tells a story,  and it shines alongside some incredible voices.  If you have anything by this man,  you must have this.  If you are not familiar with this musical genius,  you must give this a try...you WILL NOT be disappointed!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty interesting game though the initial instructions could be a little clearer. I stayed up way too late playing but who needs sleep.
B00932A4XE|1.0|There is absolutely no entertainment value to this film whatsoever.  Expecting the unexpected is a start, but I never expect to only be able to withstand 50% of any movie.  What a waste of time!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day has yet to write a book that I don't love.  I read her first Crossfire Novel and fell in love.  I couldn't wait for the next two.  The whole series is hot, hot, hot!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I was just listening to \\"In This Light\\" for the first time and I got chills.  We never thought this day would come.  We gave up hope long time ago.  This is proof that we can overcome any obstacle in our life.  This is a great day reading through everyone reviews.  Everyone so happy.  This album easily gets 5 stars if only to compare it to the terrible years.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I am so addicted to this show!!! Love the new spin on the whole vampire thing. Very cool but not for children at all!!!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Fair warning, this book has no plot and is written like non-fiction.  Being a zombie survival book, you're learning a bunch of stuff you most likely will never use except in conversation with friends after a zombie movie marathon.  That being said, this book was a strangely compelling and enjoyable read.  I would recommend it.
193700788X|4.0|OK, so I understand that some readers do not agree with how all the characters ended up.  And I can say that I agree with portions of that.  However, when a series is this long and there are so many characters, it's got to be hard to finish the story for all the characters and wrap the entire series up in a nice pretty package.  Ms. Harris did that, IMHO.  I have really enjoyed each book and I can honestly say that at the end, I closed the book and sighed with happiness, thinking \\"well it's over.\\"  I figure in a few years after the details of the story become blurry in my mind, I can reread the series and I'll have 13 wonderful books to enjoy.  I can't wait to see what Ms. Harris decides to do next!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|addictivly fun. and fun and addictive you can loose hours and hours all the wile even thoe you dont think you R ure actually training your brain a little with every puzzle

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game very much and it is simple and fun.  Keeps your mind busy.Just sit back and enjoy.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Fun movie, right up there with ET. The whole family enjoyed it. Just good clean funny acting.  I hope they make a sequel.

B009AJD5E0|2.0|There were a lot of scenes that were pretty lame. I normally like movies like this but this one is not be high on my list.
B009R659L8|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book. I love mysteries and this was a very good one. Mary Higgins Clark you have done it again.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I liked this movie. It was action filled and kept your attention. The characters were believable. I did not read the book so I have no comparison.
B003QS9TKU|5.0|I remember loving this movie when I was younger, and it hasn't lost its charm.  My boys (4 and 6) loved the magic, the whimsy and the songs.
B007IV11PM|5.0|Recently started watching and I am hooked love the show. Great mix of humor and scifi. Will miss the 11 th doctor
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is  easy to use and just a touch is all I have to do for all use with this app.<br /><br />I vlove it!<br />Thank you!<br />Janet
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty fun and addictive ; some can be challenging and make you think. I got my spouse hooked on it too.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I keep in touch with my family 400 miles away everday with this app.  I need to figure out how to use the facebook calling on the kindle fire though.  I love the video calling on facebook.<br />Thank you!<br />Janet

B0058W74UY|3.0|Not to sure about this yet. But initial is don't like.  I love google chrome!!!!!!!!!!!  ,that is all I.  Have to add.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|This series was not as good as Band of Brothers and at times I thought I was watching a war movie mixed with an x rated sex film. The love scenes did not enhance the movie at all. It did a good job of showing us  a glimpse what our fighting men must go through when we ask them to go off to war and fight for us. It did really make me appreciate the sacrifice many have given for me.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game because it's awesome best Dragon game EVER I love u should too:):):):):):):):):):):):):):) get it now it's FREE
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 1 sucks temple run 2 is 1000 percent better<br />The best part is there are gems survive much better power ups get it now.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The only thing I don't like about this program is that sometimes it just closes on it's own and backs me completely out of the program.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The app is really fun fun but destroying and building is a lot of coins. but besides that the game is awesome.
B005SAP45I|3.0|The boys, ages 6 and 4, loved the movie. It  provided some exposure to locations around the world, but the accents of the characters were stereotyped.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|What can I say - did not disappoint the teens in my house.  Not sure it would hold my attention for more than a second or two...
B0067TQQI8|5.0|If you carry a personal phone and work phone and ipad etc., this is for you!  Not too heavy but it packs a charge that will be for you when you need it most.  When on a flight, I turn my phone off and hook this baby up and when I land, fully charged!  I really like this idea to keep my phones topped off if needed!<br /><br />Perfect for salespeople who do not sit near a charger all day!  Price is right and performance is superb!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Always wondered what Mahjong was all about. This app is easy to understand and play!  I can see myself staying up all night playing Mahjong! Very fun!!
B00821OX98|5.0|It is a great series, love the story and characters.  I am a 68 year old grandma, who grew up loving alien stories. Call me crazy but like Jody Foster said in the movie &#34;Contact&#34;  when asked if she really believed in Aliens, &#34;if there's not, that's an awful lot of wasted space&#34;.<br />So enjoy!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is very suspenseful.  I wouldn't recommend it for small children but we enjoyed every minute!  I can't wait for the next one!
B00000633N|4.0|Very honestly I don't like short CD's, with few musics, but even though, it's still a good CD.<br />Good choice.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Compelling characters, interesting story, well thought out. Very looking forward to Tower Lord! Would love to see where the author will take it from here...
B008B0QH5S|3.0|Maybe I don't give the right / appropriate rating for this CD because I'm still enjoying more the other ones I bought together, and I'm still waiting for the arrival of the &#34;fresh&#34;, brand new Electric.<br />Maybe in the future I make another better rating...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Best game of all time it is great for kids 10 and up  because it he's no swears but has a bit of blood and you can buy something called blood bath for the older or grim people but other than that best shark game of all time . :p
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy this show.  It's different and I like the depth of the actors/actresses.  Their personalities are really interesting.
8866130915|5.0|Every year since I retired (2008) I like to order this type of planner and keep all of my appointments in it. It has space enough for notes regarding each day.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is challenging but would be better if u had some hints or clues in case u did get stuck.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|i love this movie it makes me laugh and smile its a good movie when im down to make me smile
B008C20TDG|5.0|Read the book first, and am now in day 21 and it's changed both my life and my husbands.  He is off is blood pressure medicine and feeling so much better.  Thank you Whole30
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must say, reading this book will change yout life, (and make you want to watch the movie) it's so heart filling. I have sooo much praise for this book, I have to give multiple reasons. (Don't mind me, I just love making lists.)<br /><br />1. The characters. I loved the way I felt like I was Katniss,yet felt like I was watching as a guest of the Hunger Games just with all of her thoughts. I love how she isn't 'charming' or just a country gal with no talent at all.<br /><br />2. The story. It was classic and original, and while I read this book I wasn't thinking &#34;wow, that's exactly what happenes in…<br /><br />3. The way she described things. It was just &#34;a forest&#34; it was the arena forest. How Katniss uses her surroundings, cracking to even the smallest of details like how she belted herself ino the tree.<br /><br />4.The flow. Everything that happened wasn't like some random suprise. It built off everything perfectly. It takes hard work to get into a flow. I'm not surr howmny hours she spent slving over this book, but it was obviously enough.<br /><br />I love this book, and read it like no tomorrow. READ IT. Once I got going with this book, I couldn't put it down. No, couldn't isn't the word, I wouldn't put it down.<br /><br />If you look at the title, you see another book mentioned. That's because since The Hunger Games is so good, it deserves a comparison. To me, I can't decide which is better.<br /><br />~ Awesomeness :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! !!<br />It is very addictive I recommend it for everyone it test your thinking. I like the graphics on it to.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love the dragons in this game, they are so cute.  The only problem is getting gold through Amazon Kindle.  For some reason it never works.  I have to constantly contact Amazon to get my gold to show up on the Kindle Fire.  On my android phone it works perfectly every time.
030758836X|5.0|I'm a big fan of Gillian Flynn's.  Her stories have realistic characters living flawed lives.  There are twists and turns with surprises along the way.  Lots of suspense!
B0091VTISO|5.0|Conan the Barbarian (2011) is a five star movie in my opninion because it delivers everything you could ask of an action adventure while staying true to the original sword and sorcery texts of Robert E Howard.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I like the older versions, but I just love this movie because of the absolute gloriousness of it all... Even after seeing this movie so many times, and this is my third copy to own, I still just imagine the Phantom to be the hero, especially with this actor in it... But, alas, the show must keep to the plot... Wonderful, wonderfully tragic, romantic... Great composing, awesome storyline to start conversation with...
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Great flick.  Lots of action.  You think we got corrupt people in power now?  Wait until you see the former Mayor and law officials back then.<br />And unlike &#34;The Dirty Dozen&#34;, or &#34;The Planet Of The Apes&#34;, or a host of other hit movies with Black Actors who are killed off during the movie; the Black Actor in this film doesn't die.  How refreshing.
B00011D1OA|5.0|I had run out of ideas for a gift for my daughter... She loves music, dancing, Audrey Hepburn, and dress-up... My father suggested a DVD - My Fair Lady... and he couldn't have been \\"righter\\" - hahahaha - I remembered this film vaguely, from my childhood, and once we watched it, it was so perfect - we've watched it about ten times since!!  Every little girlie girl needs to see this movie - what a joy... The best part is that we use the songs in our everyday life, and my poor husband does everything to keep his sanity... BEST MOVIE EVER!!!<br />Also, it arrived on time - better timing couldn't have been planned - on my daughter's birthday, while she was on the phone with her Grandpa, who lives in Africa... She opened the box while on the phone and told him what was in the package, and then he proceeded to tell her a little bit about the film and the actors... It was super special!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!!  Where do I begin?  From the cover to the end of the story was beautiful.  The title for this book was so perfect.  Hopeless - We, as readers waiting on that first kiss that did not happen. Wow!!  Hopeless - In the way Holder felt when he watched Hope (Sky) get in the car, to when he never stopped looking for her.  Hopeless - After Sky started to remember what happen to her.  To Holder learning what happened and understanding why his sister did what she did.  Hopeless - to any one that has gone through what Sky (Hope), Lesslie, and Karen has.  As survivors, just know you are NEVER - Hopeless.  Read this story!!  You will remember this one.  For some - yes, it is just a story.  For others.....  Over 4400 five stars reviews cannot be wrong.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|The cover works well to protect the screen and does not add significantly to it's weight.  I don't use it in standing position so I can't comment on its functionality in that regard.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I did not enjoy this as much as the first book, but it was good. Different idea than first or even second book.
B003730LRY|4.0|I liked  this movie  for sure,  I  wish  amazon  would have more  like this on prime but i  can only  hope
B000SEIK2S|5.0|If you like sic-fi, then I think you will truly enjoy this book. The characters are well developed and the story line can really suck you in!
B00006RAKP|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to his music over the years.  I like the greatest hits concept and this cd<br />is wonderful.  Got it when they said I would also.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Love Jeffrey Archer - just wish the series was finished so I could read them one after the other. In saying that, this was the weakest of the three so far however I'll buy the next one too when it's available.
B000UR9T82|5.0|its a great product and a great series to me. yeah the third one kinda got crazy but whateves i'm over it
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought that it was well done movie with a lot of excitement and can't wait for the sequel to come out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has been a favorite series and I have not missed any episodes of the two prior series.  Great acting!
B00006J3WH|5.0|Best. CD. Ever!!! I love Buffy, and was delighted to see the CD on sale! It was here fast, is in perfect condition, and is being vastly enjoyed!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter is 9yrs old and is enjoying learning how to take care of a horse with this game. It's similar to the on the iPad.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Chose to purchase J.Cole's album over Kanye West's after all the negative reviews following Kanye's album and I have to admit it should have been a no brainer! This album is great all around from start to finish. One would think with having 21 tracks that a couple songs would be &#34;filler&#34; material and not aligned with the album as a whole but I can say I let this album play entirely through back-to-back and enjoyed it just as much as the first play through.
1594204217|4.0|I am a big Michael Pollan fan so i really liked this book. His analysis of food and our social attitudes towards it is always thought provoking. However, be warned, if you are expecting a cookbook, this is not it. He does have recipes for certain types of food preparation, but even he states that you will probably never do the things he describes in the book. It is more of an analysis of food preparation and our current paths regarding food. I recommend the book to anyone interested in food.
0062255657|5.0|I was initially disappointed by how short it was (esp. since I paid full price + postage to get a signed copy from an independent store), and I decided I'd try to make it last as long as possible by reading only a bit of it at a time. However, once I started readin, I was so swept up by the story, so involved in the fate of its protagonist, and then so in love with the Hempstocks, that I couldn't put the book down. I just kept reading and then re-reading the most vivid, occasionally beautiful, and often frightening descriptions I've seen in a long time. The book has a few flaws--like the sometimes stilted prose in the beginning that, thankfully, becomes less noticeable as the novel progresses--but the characterization (at least of the protagonist and the Hempstocks) is lovely, and the plot gripping. It's definitely a book I'll enjoy reading over and over again. I've already ordered the limited, illustrated edition!
B00846REIS|2.0|I rolled my eyes the entire time. I didn't care about the characters at all. Not reading the other books.
B000S398WU|5.0|I was invited to a party and saw this playing. Right there and then, I had to get it. If you love jazz music, this is one hell of a compilation you must have.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved basically the whole book with some minor reservations near the end which I won't go into in a public review.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book leaves you hanging and its clear that the only reason why is for the author to earn more money off another book! Drama after drama, and added details about characters for nothing. What a snore, what a let down, I really feel as though I didn't get my money's worth with this one. Big disappointment, this story is going down hill fast.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I was unfamiliar with the Longmire series of books as well as the TV series until recently.  Last year, I caught the end of one of the last TV episodes and recognized the locations where they were filmed--northern New Mexico.  At first I was confused as to why I was seeing places like Valle Caldera (the scene outside Longmire's front door) and Taos' town square being portrayed as part of Wyoming, but I guess that's show biz.  Just before the new season started A&E had a \\"marathon\\" of the prevous season of \\"Longmire\\" so I set the DVR to record them.  I enjoyed them thoroughly so I started watching Season Two regularly.  I figured I would give the book series a chance as well since books are almost always better than the TV show or movie.  Consider \\"Rizoli & Isles\\", the awful TV series based Tess Gerritsen's outstanding series of thrillers.  Or \\"Bones\\".  Or..., well, you get the picture.  Most TV producers and writers can make a mockery of well-crafted books.<br /><br />Initially, I thought \\"Cold Dish\\", the first in the Longmire series, was a bit too wordy.  Johnson was elaborating too much on the episodic parts of the story.  And there are numerous episode within this book on which he elaborates (I found three sections of the book were used for the plots of three different full episodes of the TV series).  The structure of the book was not at all like the normal thriller/mystery novel I was used to reading.  Later, I read an interview with Johnson in which he stated \\"Cold Dish\\" was never meant to be the first book of a series, rather it was written as a stand-alone novel.  The series evolved due to the requests of the publisher.  Once I knew the book was written as a stand alone novel, it was evident that Johnson's style was pretty traditional and not \\"wordy\\" at all.  You just have to dedicate yourself to the fact that there will be several sidebars in the book that seem off track initially but will reward you in the end with rich characterizations and plotting.<br /><br />This is a book I highly recommend.  It's one of the best books of any genre I've read in quite sometime.  The author Craig Johnson is apparently a controversial character who built his own Western-style myth about himself as a promotional tool for his writing.  No matter, his work speaks for itself.  If you like thrillers, Westerns, police procedurals or just well-written books in general, \\"Cold Dish\\" should be on your list of books to read.><br />This is a book I highly recommend.

B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Thank goodness G5 has gotten better since this game. I never would have gotten another one of their games if this had been the first one I played.
0920236162|5.0|A wonderful book, richly illustrated and cleverly told, The Paper Bag Princess is a must-have for every girl and boy. Yes, boys too can learn some valuable lessons here as well, even if it is primarily for and about little girls. I recommend this one wholeheartedly!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app as part of Amazon's free app of the day and it's been pretty fun so far. It isn't super obvious in the beginning what the game wants of you but there is a helpful pop up guide that walks you through initially. Great, engaging game and quite realistic looking compared to the cartoony styles that seem to proliferate the games section.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it,its a romance/love story/heart felt book.it makes have emotions with the book it makes you sad in some situations and happy in others.as well as oh my gosh I can't  believe that happened.i give this book five stars and its hard for me to stay enthralled in a book.i hope she writes more books.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|My wife and I went to see the Cirque du soleil version of this album and it was fantastic! Great CD and great show! A must have for any music collection.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game while basic and fun can be enjoyed by people of many ages. Very fun to play with little ones.
B00005YU1O|5.0|You have to give this movie at least 10-12 minutes to catch the drift; once you're in the flow, there should be no looking back for anyone open for a ride on the higher planes of mind. If enough people wake up in time, by 2016 we can collapse the remnants of the 2 party duopoly that has almost destroyed this nation (with our blessings, it should be noted; we voted for the hell we elected!). I'd prefer to see an independent coalition of progressives and libertarians agreeing to dramatically downsize the fedgov and then taking the gloves off to decide how much socialism to impose on a state by state basis. This movie can help fertilize the national zeitgeist.<br /><br />If we can't rally enough people for that dream, I'll be more than happy if Rand Paul drags the GOP back into the realm of respectability (he has to continue to back off on gay marriage and abortion to do that; he's already got foreign policy nailed down). If he does that, we can look to the trifecta in a Goldwater 2.0 GOP.

B005HEPN06|5.0|I am always searching for the show on TV and it rarely comes on anymore. I am so excited that I can watch any episode anytime I want! I watch my favorites over and over again.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|My two granddaughters really enjoyed it. I particularly like the moral, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Also, no expletives, or foul language.
1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has condensed the teachings of the world's most influencial spiritual masters, making their insights more digestible. Thank you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much! My horse is my life omg I love her or him I'm not sure the gender....
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Read the book and watched the movie, loved both. Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic, but I think Bradley Cooper was not recognized as much as he should have been for his performance. He was also fantastic.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have read Hosseini's last two books and was throughly engaged. Although this book kept my attention, and once again gave a peak into the challengaes of Afganistan, I am not not sure I will remember content for any period of time.  Connectiong all the relationships over time is great, but I wasn't enthralled.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|Lots of action and adventure. I think this one is the best of the his movies. It is so good I have seen it twice.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|If you've heard of The Piano Guys on YouTube and like them, you'll like this album.  You can listen to every one of these songs on YouTube to see if you'll like it, and then you can buy the album to listen whenever you want on your devices or in the car.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so cute, I like the activities if you like horses it's a good app I defiantly recommend this game.
B008EKON56|1.0|I expect  and, otherwise, have received great quality products from Fiio.  I have the E11, E17 and E09K DAC/amps along with the requisite LOD cables for my iPhone an laptop.  This connector is junk compared to the other products.  For starters, the data pin connector is not tight and has no locking mechanism. It will fall out of the iPhone 4S with little movement.  Even worse, the 3.5mm audio port is so loose that I can't get any of my Fiio brand cables to fit tightly - same problem with another brand -  resulting in loss of audio.  I am returning this and ordering another in hopes that this is a rare production issue.  The concept is great and I am hopeful that the replacement will have a better fit.
B00CO52NLI|1.0|I like the game it's different and fun but the fact that it's a free game and you have to pay for the other animals is down right stupid.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Is when the water sounds mixed with white noise is by his ear. It's been a lifesaver! I would never get any shut eye without it.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|This adaptor worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3 from the get-go!  After an attempt with an off-brand that didn't work at all, I returned it and got this one - worked right out of the package.
B00BP3DPJY|3.0|This album is very much 'of the now' in terms of being directly aligned with pop culture. Beards. Plaid shirts. Greaser haircuts. But holy smokes -- these guys are talented.<br /><br />One of my few complaints is how painstakingly hedonistic their sound is. Nevertheless, Muchacho is a soaring, summer-anthem packed delight that shouldn't be missed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Last part is best suspense is well done great book good young read. More people should read this great book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I freaking loved this book! Just what I needed to break me out of my reading slump! I loved that Drew was NOT alpha and that Kate was a self reliant lady. She didn't fall down at his feet like the others. She made him work for it. And she proved she could be just as ruthless as him when it came to getting what she wanted. I'm not even sure what else to write about this book. It was fantastic! The right mix of funny, sexy, and all together greatness!<br /><br />I fell in love with Mackenzie! She's a smart cookie. Sweet, funny and adorable. Alexandra....I really liked her. She knew Drew needed a good kick in the pants and boy did she deliver. Delores, I would love to learn more about her. A chemist that dresses like a hooker and goes into battle for her best friend? There's got to be a great story there!
B002QRWJA4|1.0|Could not get assessed when I tried to download it. I am not sure if it is the device I am using.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Love prequels! Was a good family movie to watch especially after introducing your kids to Wizard of Oz. Lil scary for young ones.
0679805273|4.0|I ordered 8 books...only 7 came with a cover...?  So even though the books were well received, I had to choose one recipient to get the one with no cover.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved this book, it was so unpredictable and took many unseen turns. The ending however was slightly unclear but I'm sure my questions will be answered in the next book!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is really good and a fantastic partner to the movie. It is funny and heartfelt, an all around good read. Give it a try!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|IT WAS JUST &#34;OK&#34;, IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP ME GOING.  PLUS, IF I GOT STUCK, THERE WERE NO HINTS.
B003Q6D5PM|5.0|I found this book revealing and simple to understand, it has helped me see the potentiality of me being a toxic parent and<br />the way out!  I thoroughly enjoyed this and Six Promises for Emotional Well-Being (Unabridged) audiobook by Susan,<br />I highly recommend them both!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game<br />My niece is going to love this game. Can't wait for her to play it.<br />She so wants a horse. This game will let her have that chance.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Good application with a quick download and frequent updates.  I tend to use this app more than Google read due to the selection of downloadable material.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed the adventure of this strong women and her determination to accomplish her goal. Felt like was hiking with her.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Far to much story and not enough game play.  I was expecting more from this, extremely disappointed.  Deleted soon after download.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The Oxford American Dictionary is an excellent resource for students and professionals of any age and/ or industry.  Easy-to-use .
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My all time favorite PC game.  I was very excited to download to my android tablet.  I was not disappointed, great game place and hours of fun.  Worth your time!!
B00C2VIA52|2.0|SAYS I NEED TO UPDATE MY VERSION OF THE GAME BUT THERE IS NO OPTION TO DO SO ON THE KINDLE APPS STORE. EXTREMELY ANNOYING!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|One of my favorite PC games.  I was excited yet skeptical when downloading the android/tablet version.  Was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed playing the game.  It is worth the download.  The in game adverting to download other games in annoying.
B000001EYO|5.0|I like great movie soundtracks and the one for this film is crucial to the off beat plot and crazy characters. There is mostly stuff you never have heard or haven't heard in decades. The lack of CCR is my only regret because the dude's affection for John Fogerty reveals an incredible amount about him, especially when he yells a cabbie how much he hates the Eagles, man. The Eagles were never the American force of nature CCR is, but many assume the bands are pretty much in the same genre or league. Dude gets CCR, he gets the culture and you should get the album unless you love CCR and can only afford one. The new John Fogerty CD Wrote A Song For Everyone is, in my mind, the perfect soundtrack for Occupy Democracy, for real this rime.
193700788X|1.0|This book was terrible!  I am sad that this is how it had to end.  This Author's give a shit is definitely broken!  Who really wrote this crap?  I admit the last several books have been a little off, but this one ran completely off the rails!  If Charlaine Harris no longer cares about these characters she should never have written this book.  If you have loved this series from the first, don't read this!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Book three of the Hunger Games trilogy was a read that just kept getting faster and faster......suddenly, I realized that the story was almost over. It is a fabulous trilogy of books that can be shared by mothers and daughters, and then discussed, using themes such as hunger, the equality of men and women, or boys and girls, violence, and the idea of war and who really wins, and at what cost. Boys who enjoy the books should definitely be included as well.<br />I highly recommend this trilogy of books to anyone, young or old. We all have lessons we can still learn.<br />Enjoy!!!!!  :0)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So prompt you put others to shame! Great prices and value. Tax free.  Love the variety of things to browse and BUY! Keep up the great work! !
B008NEMN0K|3.0|Except for CLDSK, does anyone else have an opinion regarding the 3D aspect?  How good is it?  Does the 3D change the<br />movie's feel, or is the 2D version sufficient?  My opinion is no.  The 3D is not good enough; it's barely better than my<br />television's upscaling.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Cute story! Cute message! Any age will adore it! Nothing inappropriate just a great movie altogether. Can't sit to see #2
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's experience couldn't have been more convincing of the continuity of life beyond our physical existence in this physical world.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|A little short for my tastes. Took me about two maybe two and a half hours. Good game in all other regards.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Nice game for kids although it does play a little slow.  Graphics are decent for a kindle.  Would be nice if there were more building options and freeform options.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Although this season is very different than the previous ones, I enjoyed it a great deal!  The storylines are more interesting, and you learn more about the doctor.
B004UQPM4E|3.0|For $109 + Tax & Shipping ($123) The box comes shipped with corners bent , the box has wrinkles and when you open up the disc folder, every crease has flaking paint. The movies are fine, I looked really closely to see if I got a used box set but I see no other fingerprints. Not worth the price I paid, maybe $40 for this.
B0013O123Q|4.0|I like this movie even though it was a bit strange even for my standards. I believe it's a must see movie if you like weird/strange movies.
B00BXUG0KU|4.0|I exercise a bit daily with my mp3 player plugged into my ears and they first time I listened to this, it was o.k.; third or fourth time around it gets much better. Very enjoyable...
B0053O89YM|5.0|A friend of mine wanted to see it  but has to go to work too early in the morning so as a gift every year on her birthday I give her a season - so now she is up to date on a program she cannot see on the tele.  GOOD JOB
B002SSUQFG|5.0|What a great watch, keeps good time, easy to read dial, good price. So if your looking for a daily plain jane this is the way to go. Good price and a true workhorse just remember it's an automatic so you can't bash it around like a quartz.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My grandchildren and nephews loved watching it.  As I sat in the background watching them scream and laugh it filled my hear with joy.  I am so glad I purchased this movie.
B009NZP8T6|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone involved in any way in the &#34;New Thought&#34; movement.  In an attempt to take the wind out or our sails, I suspect Burkeman may have helped set us (me) back on course.  He mentions &#34;New Thought&#34; in the first Chapter, if not in the Preface.  The author, coming ouf journalism as he does, knows how to go after a story, research the hell out of it and then, (and this is rare in journalism these days, especially on this side of the Atlantic) deliver well-written, thoughtful and engaging prose.  I enjoyed this book immensely.  His arguments against positive thinking dont always hold up under careful scrutiny but they engage the mind and challenge complacency.  The emperor may in fact have no clothes on but you wont know will you until you look.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is truly and very fun and addictive game.  So many rooms to play in.  Very rewarding and just fun to play!  The only issue at times game freezes, the slots are money grabbers with very few rewards, and the special rooms are very hard to get when collecting rewards.  Otherwise very fun game, love playing it.
B0000DD79B|5.0|SIMON & GARFUNKEL-ESSENTIAL SIMON & GARFUNKEL: From their humble beginnings as a one hit wonder high school act called TOM & JERRY to the most recognized, influential duo in the world, SIMON and GARFUNKEL's five indispensable albums, including their flawless finale BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER were undisputed pinnacles of folk rock during the late sixties/early seventies. Prolific, reflective tunesmith PAUL SIMON's catalogue included the jubilant gospel crunch of CECELIA, stark anthems THE BOXER and SOUNDS OF SILENCE, and the whimsical AT THE ZOO, refined works put across with sparse instrumentation and the duo's pristine PHIL & DON EVERLY-influenced vocal harmonies. Although liner notes or at least a lyric sheet should have been included, ESSENTIAL takes everything that was so perfect about 1972's fourteen track sampler GREATEST HITS (which every music fan seemed to own back then), more than doubling the amount of splendid, timeless music, mixing vital album tracks in with all those shimmering AM radio classics.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE BAD HAIRCUTS
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|If you love war movies, and you have never seen this one (hard to imagine) - you should remedy that the next time you have a free evening.  A great story and superb performances by William Holden, Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins make this a movie to be enjoyed every time you watch it ... and you're guaranteed to be whistling Colonel Bogie's March for at least a week after watching it.
0062082353|5.0|This is an amazing read, written by an amazing man. Full of amazing stories, some humorous, some inspiring. Through his words, you can tell that Mr. Kyle felt himself as a patriot and a protector. Highly recommended!
157421327X|5.0|If you've never Zentangled, which I find hard to believe, you're going to love this.  We all doodle, daily.  Maybe just a bit, but some days we do it a lot.  This book starts you on the path to an art form that can be very relaxing, very addictive, and very creative.  Check YouTube for some Zentangle videos (my favorite is the RainbowElephant!), and then come back and start with this book.  There are several more after that.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|As a teacher of cardiovascular physiology and someone who is really concerned about the epidemic of obesity, I wish that more of those in politics would read this and realize that there is a applicable way to address this real problem of obesity in the population and at the same time increase the quality of what we get out of the education system
B004IPPINW|5.0|I read Hamid's first book and felt him to be an important Pakistani voice in our global society. I couldn't put this book down, not only because of its original structure, but also because of the voice of the main character who comes to America as a student, rises among the best and brightest and then changes his perspective about our country after 9/11.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this game is so good for me. kids will love this game no matter the age

B0006A9FMI|5.0|Another cut at the fundamental Sci Fi question by Mamoru Oshii.<br />Examined thru the lives of various types of &#34;artificial life,&#34; we are treated to the second movie and life/work after the departure of Major Motoko Kusanagi.<br />If you can arrange to see via the Blue-Ray media, it's a better experience and more beautiful. The DVD isn't up to the usual standards of those involved.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I love these books.  Have read them all.  Enjoy them as much as I have.  Beam me up, Scotty. Out.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|They pulled out all the stops for the mid-50s when making this one, even pushing the envelope on manipulating plastics to build Robby.<br />If you watch it just to see the matte background paintings it will be worth your while, but you'll want to savor the whole thing. It's a vintage Sci Fi masterpiece.

B000SEHJGQ|1.0|I don't care how important this author is, this was one of the most depressing books I have ever read.  I kept expecting some hope but it never came.  The book started out with a terribly depressing childhood, moved on through physical deformity, and ended with a useless, hopeless adult.  What was the point?

B00D6BQPMM|3.0|Cute film based on the notion that the zombie plague can actually be reversed.  In the middle of the world going to hell in a handbasket love actually blossoms.<br /><br />One of my few gripes was that John Malkovich's character was not used enough.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, keeps you reading, especially when they get back to the games! Just when you think the capital game get any worse, they do! Btw I can already tell the movie is going to suck compared to the book! On to book 3! Enjoy!

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|It was a long movie at almost 3 hours but because it was so fascinating and captivating, it didn't feel like it.
B00C7BZYF6|3.0|Based on true events, director Sofia Coppola gathers a couple handfuls of young starlets and gives them some pretty meaty roles.  As portrayed, this gaggle of teens (Katie Chang, Israel Broussard, Emma Watson, Claire Julian, Taissa Farmiga, Georgia Rock and Carlos Miranda) play stereotyped Hollywood dimwits who decide to invade famous personality's homes.  At first these robberies are done on a lark, but then they realize that there is money to be made.<br /><br />Essentially ignored or pampered by their clueless parents, their goals are to be the next Paris Hilton.  Speaking of Paris, she allowed the film to be partially shot in her actual home.  This film won't do much for her image, starting with the throw pillows that have her picture on them.  Jeez.  I thought Emma Watson and Taissa Farmiga, playing adoptive sisters Nicki and Sam, did the most with what they were given.  Sometimes funny, especially when it came to their goals in life, sometimes serious, but mostly just sad.<br /><br />Fortunately these kids left their calling cards all over the place, including being photographed in the act by security cameras and by bragging to their friends.  Perhaps the only ones dumber are the celebrities who leave their doors open, their cars unlocked and wads of money and jewelry laying around.  This isn't a great film, but has enough panache to be just interesting enough to watch.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|A sad story of our history. But some parts were so funny! A must watch that I would recommend to all!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Zombies or their equivalent appear to be the monsters of choice these days.  They've even populated comedies.  And now one of filmdom's biggest stars, Brad Pitt, joins the battle.  He plays Gerry Lane, a former United Nations agent known for getting in and out of hot spots.  He's not a para-military type.  Quite the contrary.  Now retired and spending \\"quality\\" time with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos from TV's \\"The Killing\\") and their two daughters (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove), he runs into trouble just after the opening credits.<br /><br />Director Marc Forster wastes no time getting into the action as the Lanes are caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia.  This early onslaught of zombies never lets up which is one of the great things about this movie.  These zoms run with the speed of Usain Bolt and have no problem hurling themselves at people, windows, vehicles or diving off buildings.  Once a victim is killed he or she will convert in about 10 seconds.<br /><br />Gerry manages to scramble out of harm's way temporarily and manages to get to a tall building where his former UN boss has him picked up.  I don't want to short change this section of the film.  The escape is harrowing and tension filled.  Gerry agrees to work again for the UN in return for relative safety for his family on a Navy ship well off the eastern coast.  His job is to find the source/patient zero and figure out a cure.  This takes him to Korea, then to Israel and finally to Wales.  Along the way he picks up clues that may lead to a possible immunization.<br /><br />Having seen scores of \\"R\\" rated zombie movies not to mention the carnage on TV's \\"The Walking Dead\\" I was curious how this film would fare with a PG-13 rating.  So here's the scoop.  We don't see any gore or blood splatters.  Yes, we get some close up zombie makeup and it's very well done.  In the final act, some zombie scientists in the Wales W.H.O. lab are really first rate, especially the one that has Gerry trapped inside a glass storage room.  \\"WWZ\\" has a fine cast and a memorable score to go with some top notch action sequences.pped inside a glass storage room.  \\"WWZ\\" has a fine cast and a memorable score to go with some top notch action sequences.
B009S33I68|4.0|I have been reading a lot of WW2 books lately but decided to go on to something more recent and this was a good book to start into another time and era.<br /><br />When I first read this book I knew this is a movie I saw several years ago with Mel Gibson, what was interesting as I read this book I remembered even further back that I had seen a ABC 20/20 a story on this and that reporter was actually one of the soldiers in the battle that barely survived, I tried looking for that story on youtube but nothing came up, I think that story came out before the internet existed.
B00BOXZAJ8|2.0|There may be spoilers...<br /><br />Not having read anything about this movie, the premise seemed interesting and I'm always up for some science fiction nonsense.  Unfortunately this film by Juan Solanas has the visual gravitas but lacks interesting leads and a script that led me to shaking my head.<br /><br />Actually more of a fantasy than sci-fi, there are two worlds, twins if you will, that apparently rotate together in orbit but a few feet apart.  Each has its own gravity, so in a common office scene, the people above you appear upside down.  Each world has its own political and cultural system as well.  One world is inhabited by the working class.  It is ugly, mostly barren and in need of an influx of capital.  The other world in controlled by a giant corporation and is where the wealthy live.<br /><br />Travel between the two worlds is prohibited and physically problematic otherwise.  Young Adam (Jim Sturgess) likes to scramble to the highest peak, never mind how he manages to get there.  He meets a young woman named...wait for it...Eden (Kirsten Dunst) who also likes to hike to this same peak but on the wealthy world.  Recalling Dunst's upside down kiss with Spider-Man, the couple manages to hook up this way until they are discovered by the authorities.<br /><br />As the years pass, Adam discovers that Eden was working for the corporation bad guys.  He had thought she was killed during that earlier confrontation with the cops.  Nope.  Just lost her memory.  As luck would have it, Adam is also a top notch chemist and has discovered an anti-aging cream that gets him a slot at the corporation.  This of course, gives him the opportunity to reconnect with Eden.<br /><br />While this might sound interesting, it isn't.  Dunst and Sturgess do what they can with the lame script but their relationship is boring as hell.  At the end of the film Eden tells Adam that she is having twins, I'm thinking when the hell did that happen?  I actually think there's a good movie in there somewhere, but this isn't it.n there somewhere, but this isn't it.

B0002KZAKS|4.0|This is coming from a strictly hobby purchase, not an audiophile viewpoint...read reviews on this, and have to agree...I love the sound out of it...i'm sure it don't compare to $300 mics, but it does the job and sounds great.  Main uses, online streaming and PA gigs now and then.....definitely recommend if you are looking for an inexpensive, yet quality mic.  Added perk: hard plastic case to keep it protected in the diff bags i'm sure i'll end up using for it...

It is multiple toys in one and is fun for little ones to try to stand with or jsut to sit and play with.<br /><br />My son is only 9 months old, so we actually Duct taped some foam bumper to the handle so if he falls he doesn't ship his only two teeth on the plastic handle as he goes down. This is a bit light, so it can topple over easily and you need to make sure you are there with your baby as he/she plays with it so they don't just assume it can hold their full weight. Otherwsie, really fun product.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Luckily the game run very well although there is no updated version to add more excitement to the game with all the new features that comes with the update. Minecraft Pocket Edition is a great game and doesn't lag and works incredibly well for the kindle fire versions but with the updates that I'm not even sure will be added the game experience will be just as worth it as buying the actual Minecraft for the XBOX 360 as on a kindle fire, Ipod and Ipad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My 12-year-old daughter loves this book, and the next 2 in the series. My husband previewed the movie and it was O.K. for her to see.
B000KGY9CE|4.0|Unless you know the history behind this, the plot can be a bit obscure. However, it is worth the strange dance between the characters and their exploration of their own and each others fears. With a fantastic cast, it is a good watch. Don't expect a history of Frankenstein or Vampyres or even the poets (although some elements find their way in). This movie is just an exploration of fear and what it can create.

0385341008|5.0|This was the most recent selection for our church bookclub, and at first I was worried.  Other people that had already started the book said it was hard to follow, since it was a series of letters with no narrative.  I personally loved the format--very easy to follow and very interesting.  I am suggesting the book to all of my fellow bookworms!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I know this may sound entirely silly, but opening up my newly received Game of Thrones: Season One Blu-Ray box set was like opening up a gift from the Gods, old and new. Being that I watched this series way later than anybody that I know, and on a non-HD stream, as well as never investing money into a TV series before, I was blown away at the craftsmanship, thought, and beauty put into this set.<br /><br />Packaging<br />The entire set is intricately put together into a series of cases. A hard shell slip case houses the DVD booklet, digital copy certificate, and the Blu-Ray housing.<br /><br />~ DVD booklet: This envelope-style, bi-folding booklet houses Season One in its entirety on dual-sided DVD discs. Having the discs in a separate booklet like this makes it easy to bring a copy with you for satellite viewing, bring to a friend’s place, or mail off to get somebody else hooked on this amazing series - all without having to bring along the entire box set. Even though I bought this package for the Blu-Ray discs, I am more excited about this feature than anything else in the packaging. Why? Because the customer needs were thoroughly considered, implemented, and catered to.<br /><br />~ Digital Copy Certificate: This is pretty straight forward. It’s a simple slip of paper with instructions and an accompanying code to download a digital copy of the season onto a multitude of devices such as a tablet, overly complicated phone, laptop, etc.<br /><br />~ Blu-Ray Housing: A foldout casing is used to securely house the Blu-Ray discs for this set. This sounds fairly dull, but consider the function of each disc being stored separately and its ease of use for a customer. In addition, the non-disc side of the disc foldout housing is printed with highly moody and beautifully shot photos of most of the main characters from Season One. Also, each disc in the set is printed with the individual house sigil from season one.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Quality<br />I originally watched this season one a whim via Amazon Instant Video. I didn’t choose the HD quality feeds, but I never saw the series any other way, so I just assumed that the gritty, dark, and nearly-impossible-to-see-scenes were designed specifically with that intention. This all changed once I popped in Disc One of this set. I was floored. I was so taken back by the quality of the film and soundtrack that I immediately chose to start watching the series again from the beginning. It is, without exaggeration, an entirely new experience.<br /><br />Special Features<br />There are a plethora of special features in this box set - everything from video profiles of the actors talking about their characters to interactive guides to Westeros. I have only gotten to view a fraction of these so far; however I am impressed with the myriad of content available. Most of if not all of the content is presented in HD quality as well. The only downside to the Special Features is that they were spread throughout different discs, so navigating the features requires one to go back and forth to the Blu-Ray player, switching out discs in a complex and needless series of steps to view the content. This is the one and only detracting part of my review for this package. All of the special featured could have physically fit onto one disc that exists separately from the series episodes themselves.<br /><br />The story, characters, and so forth….<br />I won’t use this space to hash over the who, what, where and why of this epic fantasy tale. I will however say, as succinctly as possible, that this series will become a new benchmark for how storylines are told. George R.R. Martin has weaved an intricate, intense, deceitful, loving, and desperate tale that breaks all of the conventional rules of storytelling. Martin fills the typical character roles of good and evil, but then shows the polarity of human nature within each character, their vices and blessings, and all the while, unapologetically crushes your soul in their journey.ul in their journey.

193700788X|1.0|This is by far the worst book I have ever read.  I stuck with the series despite the last few books being subpar, because I was invested and I wanted to see it through to the end.  But this was beyond a disappointment.  I struggled to finish it, which rarely happens to me.  I'm not super picky when it comes to books.  I don't know what Ms. Harris was thinking, and I could speculate on her motives - but either way, she should be ashamed of this book.  I feel bad for everyone who paid for it, and who became enthralled with Sookie Stackhouse only to have their souls crushed at the end.  Not cool, Charlaine, not cool.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie because I first read the books. Its a very good. story but it needs vol.2&3.like the books.

B0069JBKHI|1.0|This product simply works terribly.  The customer support is far worse.  I dare you to try to get customer support on the phone...you can't there is a company policy to not take phone calls (not kidding).  That seems ok if they had a well run on-line support center...nope.  We waited three weeks for a response.  The product itself works spotty at best, ours flashes the image and frequently shuts down without warning.  This monitor is responsible for waking myself, my wife or the baby up almost every night- not a feature mentioned in the description.  Save yourself the headache buy ANY OTHER baby monitor.  Thanks for reading this, I feel better getting this off my chest.

I continually had to go to the web version to keep up with friends I liked.  Create a group?  Forget it.  Constant network error.  Just skip this one folks.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|A great description of the science behind food, eating, metabolism, and how our bodies regulate themselves, including the hormones that we generate in response to eating or suddenly eliminating certain foods.<br />The &#34;what to do about it&#34; is actually a good long-term strategy, which is what most diets don't cover.<br />Most diets may cause you to lose weight, but only temporarily...your fat cells will make you feel crappy until<br />you feed them more sugar.

1932100660|5.0|T. Colin Campbell and his medical doctor son are scientists, and in terms accessible to a layperson, they present findings from decades of their nutritional research. That sounds dry, but the book is revelatory and a pleasure to read. In the simplest terms, the author makes clear that most Western diseases -- cancer, heart malfunctions, obesity -- are not genetic but instigated by the food we eat. People in other countries -- China, for example -- who eat less meat and processed foods have only a fraction of the rates among Western populations. Yet, Western medical practitioners have ignored the obvious connection. They prescribe an array of pharmaceuticals instead of focusing on the source of the problem: diet. I talked to my primary care physician about the book and its implications and he dismissed them, claiming: &#34;More research is needed.&#34; That's what the pharmaceutical industry says; that's what tobacco companies used to say.

006178480X|5.0|James Rollins has done it again.  The Eye of God is a gripping tale of science, history, adventure, and mind boggling theories of how reality, as we understand it, may not be reality at all.  The Eye of God pulls you in when a satellite sent out to study the dark energy of a comet crashes to Earth, after sending one last image of the Eastern Seaboard of the US in a smoldering ruin.  At the same time a package bearing strange artifacts is delivered to the Vatican for Mosignor Vigor Verona from a colleague who disappeared a decade before.  Inside is a skull etched with ancient Aramaic and a tome bound in human skin, the skin of Genghis Khan.<br /><br />The SIGMA crew we have all come to know and love is dispatched to different Asian countries to investigate the scientific and historical aspects of the comet and dark matter.  Rachel Verona and her Uncle Vigor join forces once again with SIGMA to help follow the historical trail that lead back to major historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, St. Thomas, all the way back to Adam and Eve.<br /><br />The way James Rollins seamlessly includes scientific theories on dark energy, quantum physics, the multiverse theory, and quantum entanglement will draw you in and keep you thinking for days after you've finished the book.  It all comes down to a these questions...  What is reality?  Are we all just a 3D hologram?  And what happens to us after we die?  Does our energy just leave the universe forever?  Or is what we perceive as death not even real?  Is it possible that our consciousness just moves to another form of a different reality, to live out the rest of our lives on the other side of the same coin?<br /><br />This book guarantees you will come to question everything it is that you think you know.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I really like these headphones. For those thinking of upgrading over a standard basic pair of wired jobs you bought for 20 bucks, these will blow your mind. Audiophiles, look for a wired option. I've noticed if I move around rapidly, I'll get glitchy artifacts in the sound. Staying in one spot, however, the sound is beautiful. The music, video game, and movie quality on these is awesome, given that you don't move around a lot. Video games like Crysis 3 are this set's real showcase, surround really works well.  Range is also great for the purpose of these, I can go to the bathroom and not lose sound. Range is impressive for a tiny USB dongle transmitter. The surround for non-surround sources can be hit-or-miss, I've found that they tend to have an &#34;opera house&#34; kind of quality with a reverb. If you don't like it, turn it off, which is easily achieved with a switch on the headphones. The little round wire spool/transmitter base was also a nice addition, the charger cable can be wrapped around on it when I don't need it.

B00459EZ7Q|2.0|While i am a huge fan of the stargate serie's I have to be honest and say that this series was far from what i expected it to be.I fell in love with stargate sg-1 and even enjoyed stargate atlantis but stargate series left alot to be desired.As far as im aware all the other sg serie's have closed in a good way but the ending of this one shows the crew about to face certain doom and then poof they never came out with another episode.I think the biggest thing that attracted me to sg-1 and sg atlantis was the way the crew worked so well together and while i got the sense that these guys and gals worked good together it still wasnt on the same level.As far as the storyline goes I feel that the producers were having a hard time coming up with anything orginal so they took some from the other serie's and even brought in some of the old actors for short parts here and there.In the end I would certainly not recommend buying this series to anybody.

B002GJT4XM|1.0|If you buy this set do not expect the digital copy code to work because it won't. That's the major flaw of the set and the price for new should only be $15 max. Otherwise I enjoyed the full version and the fact that they didn't cave to the stupid American Publishers and Producers who think Americans are as stupid as they are.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is an excellent writer! When I finished the book, I immediately flipped to the beginning to read it again. I can't remember ever doing that before.
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|My friend recommended this book to me and I am still trying to figure out why. That was over 6 months ago and I still have not finished the book. I keep picking it up, hoping it gets better, but it never does.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this app. I have several bingo apps on my kindle fire-this one is my favorite. I enjoy the different slot rooms. My favorite being New Orleans. I also love the season rooms(hint) you can rack up many bingo chips & coins in the special season rooms.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|LOVED this book and the rest of the series. I read the entire series three times and would highly recommend!
0316017922|5.0|This is a book that talks very well about a topic that everyone likes to read about, which is how to be the best! Malcom did a great job writing this and  putting together his theory on why are the best just the best on what they do.
B00846REIS|5.0|LOVED this book and the rest of the series. I read the entire series three times and would highly recommend!
B008602KQI|5.0|A Must see movie, with action, suspense and humor not to mention a little romance. Great couples film, has something for everyone to enjoy. Well rounded!! Not for the kiddos
0679805273|5.0|I bought this as part of my boyfriends gifts for when he was graduating college. I had never seen/heard of this book until this year (I know- crazy), and think it is a really cute idea for someone graduating- at any level. I also think it is a very inspirational book for the recent graduate who is nervous about the real word. Perfect gift for those graduation parties for coworkers' kids you get invited to where you do not really no too well and do not want or have the money to spend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever! I LOVE all the stuff that you can do on it! I am playing every where. You NEED to get this app. You will be thankful.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|LOVED this book and the rest of the series. I read the entire series three times and would highly recommend!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I am a second generation Manhattan Beach Native whose sister was a friend of this group and was actually named in one of their early songs.  I saw the tour which featured the songs on this album as well, they still make great music!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had 4 different people recommend this book to me. At first, I had a really difficult time getting into the book, and almost put it down, but decided to push through it since so many people told me to read it. Slow start, but picks up. The ending is crazy and I hope another one comes out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great free game. Makes you think ! Looking forward to seeing what other challenges the makers of this app come up with.
B003MC5N28|3.0|This was my second time reading this book and I am not sure why I read it again. I guess I liked the storyline of it, but I would not run to the store to purchase it.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|I bought this CD a little over a month ago,and will admit I was in no rush when it first came out. Vicious Cycle was good,but too long of an album. God & Guns was a good step forward,but LOADB is really great and well rounded. It really does have a great vibe to the album,and the songs are really good.It's one of my newer faves along with Edge Of Forever. My one question though,is why doesn't Michael Cartelleone play drums on any of Skynyrds studio albums? It's amazing what you find out when you read the liner notes. For all of the member changes and misfortunes,it's a shame that Artimus Pyle isn't in the band drumming anymore.At this point I'm just going to enjoy modern day Skynyrd for what it is,as long as it's real and has soul to it. Thank God for the remastered versions of the classic albums too.
B000OVLINI|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading Shadow Of the Wind. The details used to describe, the humor of Fermin, and mystery, will find you wanting to read more.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This processor rules!! its the best friend for a gamer!! 100% recommended!! i love this intel i5
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Enjoyed the series, interesting, makes you want to watch next chapter, some surprises you wouldn't' think would be written into the series,some sad, other are touching, some quite repulsive for my taste.
B00338QENI|5.0|Very good book.  I am recommending it to all of my colleagues. I should have gotten this information a long time ago. So very glad that I ordered it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I love this musical, Neil is an adorable villain and a great singer.  Everyone did a wonderful job in it, it's first rate, and fun, and the songs are great to sing to.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I usually don't leave reviews, but decided to make it a point to share my experience with this product and company. Received the battery and it did exactly as advertised, worked great for traveling and toting around for my phone's failing battery. However, I noticed recharging the battery began to be less consistent and was able to determine it was the micro USB connection. Eventually, the micro USB cradel completely detached and charging was impossible.<br /><br />All it took to process my warranty claim was to reply to the original email I received from the seller after my original order. The communication was fast and very pleasant. They sent out a replacement unit before even receiving my old one and also sent me a prepaid label to send back the defective battery.<br /><br />New battery seems to work exactly as expected. Excellent product, even better customer service.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like many Joss Whedon fans I really wish they would have continued this series.  It's a lot of fun, unique, a great take on what the world will be like, and the characters are wonderful together.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|so glad for an app that doesn't require all those weird permissions! after reading several reviews thot i'd give it a shot n really enjoyed it. yes, it reminds u of biblical stories, but it's not exact...like the developers used some ideas as a spring board for the app game then took it their own direction. No, i don't think it's meant to b disrespectful, and the devs even mention that at the beginning. (i'm a rather conservative Christian myself) the right balance of challenge for any level gamer. big thumbs up!
B0027GGL6W|5.0|PERFECT MOVIE, GREAT QUALITY LOVE THE QUALITY AND PRODUCT THAT AMAZON PROVIDES WITH THERE VIDEOS WILL DEFINITELY BE BUYING MORE MOVIES FROM THEM!! THANKS AMAZON
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I find this watch to be exactly what I've been looking for.  Seiko is my favorite brand of watch, and due to a significant weight loss this year, I needed to switch to an adjustable watch band.  This sporty watch has that, and being an automatic, it reminds me of the &#34;self-winding&#34; watches I owned as a much younger man (Yep, I'm 70-plus).  It weighs just about the same as my more expensive Seiko.  One caveat-if you have large wrists, buy some other model-you won't be happy with this one.
1909313033|5.0|Unique as the snoring of a Pug! A very authentic and happy-go-lucky view of the Pug's universe! Pug lover: add it to your shelf!
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|While I thoroughly enjoy the ethereal, ambient-esque Sigur Ros we've all come to know and love over the years, this album departs drastically from their earlier work - and it's a welcome change. It feels overdue, almost. I'm almost surprised that a band as innovative as Sigur Ros, a band that defines an entire genre, took this long destroy that genre's own boundaries and stretch themselves artistically to new heights. Sigur Ros can do ethereal, we know, but we this album, they prove they can do aggressive and heavy too, and just as well. This album is fresh, different, unexpected, and fantastic, still maintaining the bands lush, beautiful roots on some parts while pushing the envelope of the band's niche on the others. Well done, Sigur Ros.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Really fun you can make almost anything  including rocket launchers and vampires these things also react like they really would in the real world their is a free play where you can do anything you want and their are levels and avatars the levels are slightly challenging and fun  also very addicting
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I wasn't sure about the movie because I hadn't heard anything about it. I was pleasantly surprised how it captured me & my 15yr old son & we both enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00005NWLO|5.0|its a great album, the band feeds off the audience,and you can feel the energy,the only draw back is the arraingment,is different than the origanal from the 70s, but its still great

B008AYCSE4|3.0|This movie just made me feel very sad. It's probably an important film, but it's depressing. I would rather see a movie like this where the people are redeemed. There is a lot of sex and it's explicit. It takes you into that seedy disgusting lifestyle that many people are into. Ugh!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get this. The new update has buckets, 4 animal eggs, and cake! Get this game! I love it! :)
B000LB4DWO|4.0|I, unlike many people it seems, enjoyed this film. It captured the nostalgic feel of the Richard Donner era, and closes the book on the classic series of Superman movies. Bryan Singer did a great job directing, the John Williams score is beautiful and the special effects are the best they've ever been in a Superman film. Say goodbye to good ole American, golden era Superman one last time as the dark, brooding British superman ( I'm sorry... Man of Steel) series begins.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it it was one if the best books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down. You should really read it it will have you on the edge of your seat.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|This is just the best movie ever. Such a timeless classic. Michael Keaton is brilliant. I got this as a Christmas present for my brother because we used to watch it together.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is a really fun game and addicting. I can't stop playing it and also my sister's and most of my cousins play it so all of you should but I'm guessing you already do. :)
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I will always love this movie. The music makes me so happy. I got this for my mom for a Christmas present, and she watches it all the time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the safest most violent and sad book I can't believe it could have a happy ending. This is the strongest book I've read.

B00BPXKWGS|5.0|Received this yesterday for my birthday and I'm thrilled! However, am I the only one that this makes me feel old? I mean, has it REALLY been 25 years??<br /><br />Anyway, the disc is remastered well. I listened to a few songs on my original CD in my car and then listened to the same songs from this CD and I could tell a difference. Clearer. Crisper. A good quality remaster.<br /><br />The real treat is the live CD! Yes, I know it's songs from Tour Film, but I love Tour Film and now I'm glad I can \\"listen\\" to songs from it while I'm in my car or wherever.  It's an excellent quality show, not too much crowd noise - a real high energy disc.<br /><br />The poster and the photo cards were a nice addition though they'll probably stay in the box and never be displayed.<br /><br />Hope they give Out of Time and Automatic the same treatment.  I'm already excited about those and curious as to what will be on their \\"bonus\\" CDs.<br /><br />Thank you REM for so much wonderful music.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! Couldn't set it down! Suspenseful and such a good read. Read the entire book in one afternoon and immediately purchased Mockingjay. Excited to get started!

B007G92QGO|5.0|Well written book that kept me enthralled. I ached for those parents knowing how hard it is to love a child totally yet know that he/she is evil.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I like this album - it has really good music.  Help me to remember the movie when I listen to it.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Read it. Liked it, although I  really don't believe in Prince Charming and little Miss good shoe.<br /> Willing to read the sequel  but after that--enough!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Loved the messages in this book, loved the simplicity yet the profoundness of it,  - just loved it, I recommend it to everyone who is on a light journey, get it read it I say! This has been life changing for me.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I bought the book because I very much enjoyed reading the two previous books by Khaled Housseini.  This book was not as enjoyable or impacting to me as the other two, which left a strong impression about the harsh conditions of  life in Afghanistan particularly for women.  Several stories are told and they go back and forth, a style which I do not particularly like.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Better than 100 floors, had to get into the swing of things in the beginning because I am so used to playing 100, but liked it better!

B00CL68NOG|4.0|My son and I watch this together and we laughed and we cried because it is so true to a mother and son relationship the only thing we didn't like is that there was an F word at the end of the film
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Good action, good actors, plot, interesting characters, and small town vs big city combine for a solid movie. Loved it!
B004JMY312|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, it is a MUST! A classic Halloween Movie from the 90's with light and dark points, suitable for children and adults, funny and mysterious!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Please release more levels (rooms)! This is a great game that has the potential to keep players busy for hours. Love the gameplay and graphics!<br />Keep up the great work! :-)
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Did not buy it but it was a little fun.  Don't use Facebook that much and I rather have the regular angry birds
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is always filled with drama that captures the attention!  Excellent show with suspense waiting at every turn.  Now I wonder what's going to happen to Mary and her new baby!
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I really like this game.  It is fun and you have to be strategic.  Nonetheless this was a good purchase.
B00006JIA4|5.0|So I am a little slow.  Didn't listen to them when they were originally recording but love them now.  I sing in choirs and really appreciate the harmony.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like angry birds.  It is so cute.  This also is a great purchase.  All ages can enjoy this game.
B003PIS5XI|3.0|I remember wanting to see this in the cinema when it first came out, but I never got to it. I was a teenager then, and I suspect I'd have liked it a lot better as a teen than I did watching it now. It has dated and not well, and it's not quite saved by featuring Robert Preston in one of his last roles. Show it to your kids and tell them that's what video games used to look like. They probably won't believe you.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's ok. It's a good time killer. If you like SIM city you'll like this. But for the extra stuff y
B004YW4L5K|4.0|There were parts I loved, and others I hated. Overall, an entertaining and thought provoking read.  I really enjoyed many of the characters, especially Shadow and Mr Nancy. Also, couldn't help but feel sorry for Laura, despite her misdeeds.
B003XFVSTG|5.0|Watched it on Amazon Streaming Service and the quality was great on a 42-inch LCD. No buffering issues to speak of, and the audio was great. Will definitely purchase more streaming movies off Amazon.
B0027BOL4G|1.0|We just got around to opening this; our return window closed two days ago.  The dvd was cracked.  The label is in good condition; but the other side is ruined..  It has a long crack and is scratched in severeal places.  Sad.  We were interested in learning what it was about.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game to play! Did not think that it would be this addictive though. This is worth the free download for sure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like playing this. It has such a wide variety. Although most games are fun, there are a few that are challenging. Like I said, I love this game and rate it five stars.
B00821OX98|5.0|It will keep you entertained with every episode not a single dull moment. Totally hooked on thus tv show can not wait for the next episode.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Obviously there is talk about sex and the sexual encounters Jaycee experienced during captivity. But this book was more than that. Although the writing isn't great, which you can't expect from someone who missed out on a formal education, it was an easy read. It wasn't confusing and I found myself picturing Jaycee in the environment she often described. The pictures you see online of the Garrido's property and tents where Jaycee and her daughters were kept, really help with visual imagery. There were many sad thoughts and feelings she described and but I enjoy the ending and how she described her progress and road to recovery. She goes into a little detail about her therapy sessions and what she learned which is nice because it answers a lot of questions.mi appreciate anyone who can write about such a horrific experience. I appreciate anyone who would even talk about it in the slightest way.
193700788X|1.0|It's sad when a book in a series you like gets butchered. It's even sadder when said book is the FINAL installation in a series already 12 books strong.<br /><br />It's also EXTREMELY irritating when the normally decent author totally cops out by saying that no one will ever be satisfied with an ending because the series is so popular and has held strong for so many years.<br /><br />She also labels the readers calling foul \\"entitled\\" because we are literate enough to realize this entire book is a cop-out for her - if it was even WRITTEN by her in the first place.<br /><br />It would be different if just the plot sucked but \\"her\\" entire writing style has changed. I was thinking this a few pages into the book and it's gratifying to see I am not alone in this \\"ghost writer\\" theory.<br /><br />So excuse me for being \\"entitled\\" but -<br /><br />REALLY Charlaine Harris?!<br /><br />Maybe we all hate it because the book was totally thrown-together, scatterbrained, and random? Maybe you had already given up on it?<br /><br />After all - book fans were clamoring for a proper ending but MAYBE you're too caught up in the TV series True Blood to really see everything through?<br /><br />Maybe you just don't care.<br /><br />Well? I care. I've shelled out hard earned cash for the previous 12 books, it is obvious I'm investing in something. Whether it be the universe or characters...both of which you've totally screwed over.<br /><br />I really wished you had either let it be or just waited...however long it took to give this awesome series a proper and fulfilling ending - even if that was never.<br /><br />Because never would be far better than this flop that somehow managed to bocame a \\"best seller\\". I'm betting on the name and author alone. (Boy arne't more people going to be surprised how truly terrible this one is?)<br /><br />But instead you trudged on and completely and utterly ruined the plot and stupefied the characters for a buck.<br /><br />I only continued to read this book to convince myself \\"nah, it really can't be THAT bad\\".<br /><br />...I was sorely wrong.<br /><br />It truly IS that bad.<br /><br />This book happened to be the last by Charlaine Harris in the series entitled The Southern Vampire Mysteries. This book happened to be called \\"Dead Ever After\\".<br /><br />It really should just be entitled \\"Dead\\" and left to rest in piece...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Very clever hidden clues and codes. My only hope is that the creators add more floors and make them more difficult as you move up. I went through the first 10 floors fairly quickly only to find that there are no more floors.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just finished this book and I do recommend it.  You can't put it down.  Mystery, romance, chilling, everything in a good read.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I used this app when away from home and don't have my favorite CD for sleeping and the white noise from the room fan. It works great and I can tuck my kindle close to my pillow so  I can keep it low column.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Great sci-fi movie with a fascinating story about an advanced culture on an exo-planet . The details on Blu-ray are fantastic. One of my all-time favorites of any genre.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|After a week of streaming nearly constantly, I got my deluxe copy in the mail today. I wanted to withhold my final judgment of the album until I heard it as it's meant to be heard from the physical media. My overall impression has not changed much from the streaming to the CD: Queensryche are back! Scott, Eddie, and Whip have shown that their creative juices can still flow and they have gushed mercilessly here. Add in a youthful approach by Parker Lundgren and the return of dynamic vocals by new frontman Todd La Torre and Queensryche have produced their strongest work since Promised Land.<br /><br />Before I address the music, I'd like to take a second to discuss Todd. He's an excellent replacement for fired frontman Geoff Tate. The reasons behind GT's ouster are well known so I won't rehash them here. La Torre presence has reinvigorated the band, returned the early standout music to their proper tuning, and brought both an appreciation for Queensryche's roots and a new knowledge of musicality to the band that had been missing, at least for the past several albums. This is not to say that La Torre is a \\"clone\\" of Geoff Tate. Like Tate in his prime, Todd's range is impressive, but whereas Tate had a brighter top and a purer sound, La Torre's voice is raspier, gravellier that offers a different texture to Queensryche's music. In short, Todd pays homage to what came before, but has still made it his own.<br /><br />While all the tracks are very strong, there are a few standouts that could rival any in the band's impressive catalog. \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\" is an atmospheric, driving song that could have come off of Promised Land. \\"Don't Look Back\\" is where La Torre's vocals sound the most like Geoff Tate of old and they are impressive. \\"In This Light\\" has a hook that's sure to worm itself into your brain to stay. \\"Vindication\\" is a rocking, progressive song with a modern take on the Rage for Order sound. \\"A World Without,\\" at least to me, is the strongest track here that is a slow to mid-tempo beat and a sound reminiscent of Empire. Finally, the album's finale \\"Open Road\\" is the band's strongest closing song since Q2k's \\"Right Side of My Mind.\\" Queensryche had a reputation of closing albums with absolutely brilliant songs, and somehow after Q2k that all stopped. \\"Open Road\\" has restored the tradition. In the end, at 35 minutes, the disc has no filler. Every note and every beat is deliberate and, on the whole, makes for a very good album. I wish it weren't over so soon!<br /><br />The biggest criticism I've heard about the disc is the mastering. I didn't hear any crackling on the webstream or through Spotify, but when I listened to the CD through Beats Audio ear buds the crackle does show up. This does not take anything away from the quality of the music that's on the disc, but I wish the crackle weren't there. I think casual listeners in the car or on your average home stereo won't have any issue.
0802473156|5.0|this book revolutionized our relationship! I bought it during a rough patch when I felt be were both miscommunicating our needs but I had never bought a relationship book before so I was nervous but 2 years later weʻre engaged and we STILL discuss some of the things this book brought to light in our relationship. it made so much sense and was just what we needed to reach the next level. I even gifted it to my parents and recommended to friends.

B009NY43NY|3.0|It was just ok.  Not her best work. I normally can't put these books down but I struggled to read this one. I'm not happy with how the characters ended.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I thought the book was very interesting, and I learned much about the mood of the country before our entry into the second world war.  I had no knowledge of Lindbergh's anti-war campaigning and the divisiveness that it caused.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|I rated it 4 because the quality of the material is not the absolute best, but it is excellent for the price. I have a Nikon D3000 with a Nikon 18-200mm lens and it fits perfectly (it actually has quite a bit more extra room than expected). Because of the wide internal space I can put this camera/lens combo upward or downward (lens facing up or down) which is excellent as I prefer not having the lens facing down in case it falls. The pockets allow storing basic stuff (extra SD cards, cloth, remote controller, etc). The only think I find missing is the solid base that other holsters have to allow extra protection at the bottom.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|Not a great movie, but a fun movie, Enjoyed it and laughed. Watch for the speech at the end, funny.
1781162646|4.0|Book came in record time. So far 3 of us have read it and liked it.  Light, quick read by one of our favorite authors - Stephen King. I found it interesting that he didn't allow the publishers to offer it to e-readers, only in paper format. That was impressive. I guess Mr. King is an old fashioned reader, like me. Although I do enjoy my kindle fire.
1449410243|5.0|I got this book because I absolutely love the Oatmeal, and in fact pre-ordered it :3.  The Bob cats are my favorite and there are plenty of them in this compilation of the Oatmeal.  I can't get enough of his spot on humor.  If you have a cat and some humor I highly recommend you get this book, for all you know your cat really is plotting to kill you!  Me and my girlfriend love reading this book because her cat looks exactly like the cat on the cover and one of the Bob cats and he acts exactly like the cats in this book!  This is a hilarious book, I totally recommend it!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|does anyone know when or if the upgrade for this game is gona be available for kindle ? because apple got it and so did other android devices.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This season of American Horror Story is so thrilling and suspenseful.  My girlfriend got me hooked on this show and we marathon this show.  Its really awesome!  Plus I love Zachary Quinto and he stars in this show.  If you love horror mystery, you'll love this show.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|disappointing.  Not well written.  Descriptions of England not wonderful.  I've read better like Col. Pettigrew's Last Stand or whatever it was....
B00BU9DXAY|4.0|I absolutely love the Oatmeal and the Paradox is enjoyable. Sadly it is short compared to the cat compilation book, how to tell if your cat is plotting to kill you. :( but a good book nonetheless!
B0085YOD1A|2.0|this item was featured as a free download - meh - not for me.  Glad I didn't pay anything for it..
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|This movie was visually captivating,  though it was distinctly lacking in action overall.  I think it was a cute addition to the oz franchise,  but I doubt I will feel the need to watch it time and again.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Well, team, I had planned to read a page or two before heading out but it's now dark and I've skipped dinner. This book is a masterpiece. Like all of gaiman's work, you finish the last page with a little part of your soul crying out, 'Nooooooooooo! You can't be over! Don't be over!' It is melancholy, magical, beautiful, sweet and dark. Hooray hooray hooray. Thank you to Mr Gaiman.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Funny, heart warming, touching, a must watch movie, Bradley Cooper was amazing in this role and Jennifer Lawrence is always great!  You wont be disappointed, if you haven't seen it yet, get it!

B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is a very powerful and inspiring book, I could not put it down! I have read many, many 'spiritual' books and this is by far the most empowering....for me...<br />I would and have recommended it to everyone I know....
B004PHSTY8|5.0|This is such a great show, definitely recommended for all those who love the occult and an entertaining tv show.

B001ECQ4AS|5.0|This definitely gets you hooked. Full of suspense, humor, and intensity, this is a great show to watch when you want to be fully enthralled.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This was the first really good &#34;story&#34; I have read in a long time.  I have read many books and they were good reads, but this was a story.  It had every element in it....mystery, history, love, war, heroes, enemies, friends, lovers, family, and so much more.  The story is like a fine wine which just keeps getting better.  You can never predict where it is going, it unravels piece by piece, and you are more and more intrigued.  It never lost my interest.  I just can't praise it enough.  You won't be disappointed if you grew up loving bedtime stories!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This amazing App makes my daily devotionals very easy.<br />With hundreds of plans to chose from for any one who is hungry for the word of God.

B001J29H9I|5.0|Fantastic album! The heavy metallic Black Keys sound with soul and emotion paying tribute to one of there idols. A very cool thing to see an artist do.<br /><br />Sounds fantastic on a full range stereo. Short disc and I want more.
0345529057|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THOSE BOOKS<br />AND IT IS A VERY WONDERFUL GIFT FOR A FRIEND OR GIRL FRIEND THAT LOVES THIS KIND OF BOOKS
B004LROUNG|5.0|Great read.  I have enjoyed all of Grisham's books, and always find he delivers a good page-turner of a book.  The Litigators is definitely a page-turner.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|You need this book it is such a good book I mean it's funny<br />And the best book ever you need it
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|Since I swim only as a work-out for other sports, particularly mountain bike racing, I never liked the limitation of limiting your breathing frequency.  Now I can swim hard enough to get my heart rate up before running out of breath.  Also, with a fused vertabrae in my neck, no longer having to make the constant head rotation is a relief.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Really fun and I hope another one will come out soon. It keeps me busy and I have had no problems with it.
B008602KQI|5.0|The plebeians of the Roman Empire were kept relatively quiet and under control with bread and circuses.  I thought the trilogy of the Hunger Games books were a brilliant conjecture of a similar bizarre resurrection of this kind of entertainment in our future if we continue to allow money to dominate our political system, creating the inequality which is destroying our democratic process.  It is not a terrible stretch from the Survivor-type reality games of today's television to a future government-controlled set of games to keep the populace in their place.  This time the prize is not a million dollars, but merely the right to continue to live.<br /><br />The movie is a watered-down version of the first book which was necessary to get a PG-13 rating and appeal to the teenage audience for whom the books were intended.  Watch the movie(s) but read all three books first.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Really fun because all the birds get their own weapons instead of like the regular angry birds. I love how they upgrade the birds it just makes you want to keep playing.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|There were definitely some laugh out loud moments, and being pregnant myself, I could relate to a lot of the content.  I really enjoyed it!

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I don't care what age you are this game is fun and it will have your mind going trying to get all the stars. The levels are great too because they change the way you can get the stars each time.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Downloaded this game for my granddaughter and she likes to play it however I was surprised that besides the<br />free pet houses and other things it was very easy for her to push a button and actually purchase things for this<br />game...that I am not too happy about and have talked to her regarding this situation
B008K3HRF0|4.0|Liked the Dr. Seuss books and movies since I was younger and helps keep the children's attention anywhere we go.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app I love my horse.great graphics u can groom compete and even make your own food mix for the horse above all it is a great app especially for kids who want a pet but cant have one
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Still love movie even with the controversy over the children being thrown into a violent situation.  But I didn't read the book, though.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son. He loved it. The movie was really authentic to the time period portrayed. Although the language is very strong, with the &#34;N&#34; word being used in almost every sentence which was hard to listen to for me.
1451620829|1.0|This book is what you would expect from a former rock star. The band gets together, struggles for a while, makes it big, its members (well, two of them; Ace Frehley and Criss) go crazy on drugs, alcohol and sluts, the band members clash and argue, they break up, they get back together, they make terrible business decisions, they finally part ways for good...you get the picture. I think you'll hear the same thing in pretty much every memoir by a rock star.<br /><br />Criss's personal life is predictable and nasty. He marries his hometown sweetheart, cheats on her like crazy and eventually dumps her for a much younger blonde Playboy centerfold. Later in the book Criss is amazed to find out in time that his coke-snorting, bi-sexual, materialistic Playboy centerfold wife never really cared about him and only married him because he was rich and famous. Is this guy really that dumb? Yes, he is, as this book proves.<br /><br />Criss in uneducated and uncouth and irresponsible and a drunk/addict alcoholic. But he still holds himself in higher esteem than his bandmates Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Criss thinks he's a tough guy who cares about the music, but he's just a whiny, not particularly talented little creep, always moaning about how badly he's been treated.<br /><br />He goes into detail about the sexual escapades he and his buddy Ace Frehley indulged in. It gets VERY revolting. He talks about he and Frehley's orgies with pathetic groupies willing to do anything. His treatment of these poor, dumb girls is appalling. He and Frehley smear a naked, whacked out groupie with food and condiments, then send her down to the lobby in an elevator; they found that hilarious. Criss said he would handcuff women, put bananas in them. It's beyond disgusting. And Criss talks about it like it was NORMAL. He's a sleazebag par excellence.<br /><br />He claims that Ace Frehley was his good buddy, but he's as derogatory towards him as he is towards Simmons and Stanley. He kind of \\"outs\\"Frehley, saying Frehley liked to make out with his friend Bobby and that during a sexual encounter with the infamous Connie Hamzy Ace crawled under the covers and joined Hamzy in servicing Criss. He doesn't mince words about Frehley's pitiful drugged out and alcoholic behavior, his sexual perversity. Some \\"buddy!\\"<br /><br />Some of Kiss's crew were rough biker types. They abused the groupies even more than Criss and Frehley. They gave one girl what she thought was cocaine; it was in fact some kind of toxic cleansing powder. Criss saw the girl bleeding from the nose and said maybe she should go to a hospital. One of the bikers said, nah, if she dies they'll just dump her somewhere on the side of the road. Criss comments that although some of these guys were pretty crazy he \\"loved them.\\" He loved these creeps who would give a girl poison and not be concerned whether it killed her or not?!<br /><br />Criss whines about everything, especially money. He depicts Simmons and Stanley as soulless money-grubbers but he has a hissy fit when he finds out Frehley is making more money than him on their reunion tour. Criss was making $40,000 a show; Frehley was getting $10,000 more. It's hard to feel sorry for somebody making that kind of money complaining that it's not enough. It's just sheer greed.<br /><br />Criss wraps everything up with a happy ending. He's found the love of his life, a much younger blonde. He's no longer drinking and drugging. He survived a bout with breast cancer. He depicts himself as a spiritual, sensitive guy with a love for God who's finally achieved peace in his life. Ho-hum.<br /><br />If you're interested in the very gross details of a scummy rock star's life, then this book is for you. Just keep in mind that it's worthless trash.
B00008K7AM|4.0|The story line is good, a little odd, but funny,  The play on teen life and the worries of average girls from a different perspective, makes it worth watching.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The writing is superb and the character depth is fascinating to watch develop. Well done! The actors are wonderful, and easy on they eyes doesn't hurt either.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|I had high expectations for this album, and they definitely exceeded them. It's such an interesting and carefully put together album that it really does give every fan something that they're looking for. On Leveler, it seemed like they were going in a direction that was less heavy and more experimental, basically trying to just change it up so that they didn't always sound the same. While I certainly respect that, I feel like they didn't accomplish this task until this album. All eleven songs and 49 minutes of listening are worth it. And I mean all of it. But please beware: it has a high chance for addiction, so listen responsibly.<br /><br />The album opens with the right track in \\"Provision,\\" starting off very heavy with the chorus and punching you square in the face, leaving you with that characteristic euphoria you get after hearing a new metal song for the first time that you immediately love. And the good thing about this is there are another ten songs after this one. The second song \\"Treatment,\\" which many of the band members said was their favorite track, has an interesting interlude in the middle of the song that starts out really slow and with different instruments (maybe a violin or viola, I can't exactly tell) but builds up over time and slowly re-adds each instrument from the original song into the fold until lead singer Jake Luhrs begins screaming again, creating a really cool effect.<br /><br />Then comes the best song on the album, \\"Spirit Breaker,\\" which includes myriad of vocal techniques, mixing screams and yells and a little singing, including another interlude that has Luhrs just talking as if he's reading a letter. The lows in this song are excellent and definitely makes it a 10/10. \\"Sincerity\\" has some cool gang vocals in the chorus and \\"Creative Capacity\\" is basically a showcase of the creative wonders of the guitarists and drummer until Luhrs enters later on in the song (minus the barely audible vocals he has in the beginning). \\"Animals\\" isextremely heavy and is another 10/10 track in my opinion. If you're looking for the heaviest ABR possible taken to the next level, then that's your song.<br /><br />I never thought they would do it, but they've actually made their best album with this one. As shown by my reviews of their past three albums, they seemed to be slowing declining (that's not to say they were putting out bad albums, they were just a little less awesome as the years progressed). But they definitely regained their status as presently one of the best metal bands in the country and maybe even the world. I give this album a 9/10. Awesome job August Burns Red, you've made me very happy, and gotten a lot of fans addicted on your new music. I say that's mission accomplished.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Have enjoyed this film over and over and over. Love the story, love the acting, love the lovely silliness of the whole thing. Will watch it again, I'm sure, a number of times ;-}
B0050R0XEG|5.0|loved it, just wish that legos didn't cost so much. I would also like to find a lego VW bug to build.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|Well written account of first world exploitation of third world Congo.  Book left me wondering why I wasn't taught about these atrocities in school?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game I loved it I highly recommend it any one can play it there is nothing bad in it
B006RXQ0JO|4.0|Didn't really expect much from this film, but it is well directed, full of intrigue, with a great cast.  Plenty of violence, but a great story, and very true to the Boston society it depicts.....
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app Its better than all my apps including angry birds :)<br />And I have a LOT of games and apps
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Great, action drama with Tom Cruise as a crack ex-MP Investigator that doesnt miss a trick and can fight like Bruce Lee...  He gets the bad guys....
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Put this on headphones and set your player to \\"repeat\\".  You will literally lose yourself in the splendor of this cd! Play it again and again...<br /><br />Let's break this cd down...<br />songwriting<br />  4/5 - superbly crafted music!<br /><br />production and mix<br />  4/5 - I do have issues with all metal cds in the past 3-4 years - audio compression.  When Ian Gillan said \\"make everything louder than everything else\\" way back when, he didn't mean to clip all the presence out of a song!<br /><br />musicianship<br />  5/5 - Spectacular!<br /><br />vocals<br />  4/5 - Todd truly makes it sound like Queensrcyhe, but frankly never comes across as a Geoff Tate clone.  I do question the need for auto-tune though, which I did hear in a couple places.<br /><br />lyrics and themes<br />  3.5/5 - usually I don't care about this. I'm ambivalent unless something knocks my socks off. This is fine.<br /><br />Now... how about some other relevant factors outside of the music itself?<br /><br />honesty/integrity of this cd<br />  5/5 - metal music by guys who like metal, made for fans who like metal.  AWESOME!<br /><br />packaging/presentation<br />  4.5/5 - I get why they wanted to self-title it, but why not just call it 2013?  That's what we're always gonna call it (\\"Queensryche (2013)\\").  I don't care about the brevity - a good album is just long enough to keep me engrossed without boring me, and when it ends I should be left wanting more.  That's what happens here...<br /><br />band goodwill (ie: any positive aura for this cd)<br />  5/5 - Positivity and respect shine through. Good karma comes back to bless those who act with honor.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT - MUST BUY!!!!  (if you like honest metal played with passion by competently skilled musicians).
B00AFEXRME|1.0|This is not what I was expecting at all.  Denzel as a coke snorting, alchoholic pilot who while in the begining performs admirably by saving his Jet.....alas the rest of the movie is watching him self destuct, dodge & weave.....
B00BEXB18M|4.0|This is a capable release by Megadeth, but to say that it's \\"fine\\" is probably already its biggest insult. Megadeth in the early days used to be blistering thrash, and while this doesn't do that, it does fit in well with most modern Megadeth songs.  I put all the Megadeth studio output from 2001's \\"The World Needs a Hero\\" through to 2013's \\"Super Collider\\" into my playlist and hit shuffle.  After 6 nonstop days of playing, I really didn't find any songs that stuck out as not belonging.  Despite some strongly negative reviews, I still maintain this is a decent modern Megadeth work, and I certainly enjoy listening to it.<br /><br />Let's break this cd down...<br />songwriting<br />  3.5/5 - The first song is a clone of Black Sabbath's \\"Children of the Grave\\", but Mustaine has done that before (copying \\"Am I Evil\\" for the 2001's song \\"When\\"). I thought \\"Built for War\\" was awkward rhythmically.  But most songs are well crafted, and the bonus songs in particular are very strong!<br /><br />production and mix<br />  4/5 - good overall. Lots of interesting parts to discover using headphones, and it all sounds crisp and clean.<br /><br />musicianship<br />  5/5 - who doesn't like a good Megadeth solo?<br /><br />vocals<br />  4/5 - Mustaine may not be the best singer, but his melody lines are unique in thrash metal. They are catchy indeed.<br /><br />lyrics and themes<br />  3/5 - whatever - not my biggest issue. I admit this one is a bit of a departure for Megadeth.<br /><br />Now... how about some other relevant factors outside of the music itself?<br /><br />honesty/integrity of this cd<br />  4/5 - this is who Mustaine is, and this is the music he wants to make. It doesn't have to sound like So Far So Good So What, does it?<br /><br />packaging/presentation<br />  4/5 - I like the cover, but I am a Physics major...  :)<br /><br />band goodwill (ie: any positive aura for this cd)<br />  2/5 - gotta call this as it is.  I personally hold no ill-will for Mustaine & crew.But he has been spouting off a lot lately about conspiracy theories.  Dave... please leave those for your songs. Put them in the lyrics in a way that people can read them how they want to read them. We don't want to hear you talking about weird stuff. Let us use our imaginations when we speculate about just how wacky and unhinged you might be.  It makes the music more compelling when we're guessing that you're not quite the ordinary citizen in mindset.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT - it's definitely in the bottom third of Megadeth releases (sorted by overall appeal), but it's not out of place in any Megadeth collection, and it is a strong album on its own. If you've never heard Megadeth, probably don't want to start here...  If you own more than 3 or 4 Megadeth cds, then you should have this one too, but be sure to get the bonus tracks.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Probably one of the best Bond movies EVER!  Brings together a lot of loose ends you never thought about before like the origins of Miss Moneypenny, and M....as well as Bond himself!  Great Flick!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The saga never ends. Instead it just multiplies and becomes unanswered. There are questions from the first book that are still not answered and frankly I don't even care anymore. She develops a million conflicts and now I think Slyvia herself doesn't even know how to end it because she's gotten so ahead of herself. Well I'm done with this book and frankly  im done with the author. Please keep a cap on your story lines, if not then this happens.....
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|A feel-good book, even dealing with the unsavory side of humans.  In addition this book exposes us Westerners to the unfamiliar cultural, political and socio-economic life in Africa.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Hilarious and silly.  The rumble between the news anchors is priceless.<br />This movie goes right next to Dodge Ball and Stepbrothers
B00007E7K0|5.0|This fit my canon eos rebel T1i perfectly, I lost the original one in a restaurant and bought this one to replace it.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|A good movie to watch once and still fun to rewatch every now and then.  It's Angelina Jolie \\"akimbo\\" action and all the associated drama is fictional !!
B0063IH60K|4.0|When the game is over I can't get out of it without starting over, even when it ells me there is no-more moves.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I thought this day would never come!<br />Queensryche are back!  I mean really back!  This new self titled record is what should have come after \\"Promise Land\\". Every album the Ryche did after PL got worse and worse.  It got to the point when \\"Dedicated to Chaos\\"came out Tate and company had gone so far in the opposite direction that anything that represented what once was Queensryche was long lost.<br /><br />The biggest change here is this is the first album without the voice Geoff Tate.  Which with new vocalist Todd La Torre you will never know Tate is gone. La Torre's vocals are great. He does an amazing job. Also James Jimbo Barton back on the production end is fantastic.  I'm sure he played a part in getting the quintessential Queensryche sound back.<br /><br />The song writing is in top form too. Every track is great, not one dud. It's obvious who was holding the band back all those years. The proof is in his solo work and his lame attempt at his version of Queensryche.  I can't believe I'm saying this but good riddance.<br /><br />This is the Ryche! They are back and  I can't wait to hear more from this legendary band.  My only complaint? Too short! I want more!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very enjoyable app.  you need to use logic and treasure finding skills to move to the next room.  starts off easy and increases in difficulty.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|This is a very good movie and I love the connivence of picking a movie and streaming it. So much better than going out to get one and then having to return it. I loved Matt Damon in this movie and I would watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|All ages can enjoy! I just wish there were more levels. I'm  too impatient to wait! Even my 4 year old enjoyed it.
1742200206|5.0|I've bought this for my sister, who went for 3 months to NYC. She said it was really complete and she took it everywhere because it's very useful. Super recommend it!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I feel that this \\"book\\" is one full book cut in two and we only have the first half. I understand everyone has to make money and I get the whole cliff hanger method but this was such a joke. The book just ends mid conversation, out of the blue. the plot had just started to build and then \\"THE END\\"- what a flake. I loved the first two books and even ordered this book months before it was released. I feel cheated as a reader and I will not purchase another Sylvia Day book for this reason. Very sad.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|One of Jim Carrey's best.  Great insights on big brother, advertising, consumption economy and shallow culture.  Great supporting cast as well.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Hosseini is an excellent writer but I did not find this story as compelling as his past two books I've read (Kite Runner & Thousand Spledid Skies). I thought the story was hard to follow at times since the point of view was switched around each chapter.  He is still a very skilled interested writer but not my favorite book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game. its fun.but the free gem thing doesn't work and I run out of energy to fast. so Yea.....
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I really love being able to have  all my blog feeds in one place.  I am able to either show just the newest  posts or all of them.  I like that  I can switch to the  web view as there are times when I want to see more of the blog than the mobile view.<br /><br />I have used the offline viewers and it works great.  I would love to be able to  get the pro version and skip the ads but they are not a big hindrance.
B0078N2MTE|5.0|offbeat, but really good portrait of how so many have come to fear the dire changes in the world, Has a nice twisty ending, unexpected. so liked it a lot. teaches us that preparing is not such an odd thing after all. excellent movie
B00CX7OW1G|5.0|If you don't get this, move on, there's nothing here. If you do, like I do, you know it isn't perfect. I know of about thirty seconds or so of over-reaching, just in the way some characters move. The whole rest of the move is a total mind-blower.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I will admit I have listened to Queensryche since 1990. I own all their records and since Hear In The Now Frontier, they've dreaded in limbo. They released Q2K (underrated album in my book), Tribe (So-So), Take Cover (Okay), American Soldier (Outstanding), Dedicated To Chaos (Horrendous) & Frequency Unknown (Downright Pathetic).<br /><br />I headed into this one with my eyes closed and awaiting either something terrific or something like the last three. Instead, I was treated to something that reminded me of the early 80's Queensryche. Todd La Torre sounds like Tate throughout the album but the way he sang and the way the others blended, it was METAL!<br /><br />Alas, it's not blown away mad awesome but it's way better than the last 3!<br /><br />I really liked songs like: In This Light, Vindication, Don't Look Back, Fallout.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|An enjoyable game that's not offensive to anyone who has a sense of humor and enjoys a bit of fun. Helping Mo and his people flee evil mummies, dodge crashing waves and wielding lightening to move them, or protect them is challenging enough to keep a player interested, and simple enough for anyone to understand. This isn't a Biblical rendition, it is a silly, entertaining game...a great time killer.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|An interface which lies above the other in the same range. It is an excellent interface and also resolved absolutely all my latency issues, this is a very good :)
B005MJFA2W|5.0|if you want to know why and how we do the things we do as humans, as brains, this is the book to read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's Solitaire... what more do I need to say. I like this game when I am winding down and want something to do without working my brain too hard.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|My daughter started watching Suits & liked the show so I got Her season 1 first & then I got her season 2,but she dosen't know it yet.I got it for her birthday coming up.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The earlier levels are fun and easy but as I moved up the levels it got progressively harder. It is a great way to work your mind.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Great book.  Kept my attention all the way through.  I could not put it down until I finished<br />the book.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I purchased this book a few months ago. The opening chapter did not grab my attention. Maybe if I give it another try the later chapters will be more interesting.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Director, Get another line of work, please. Really bad, sorry our American heroes are treated so shabbily by an incompetent.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It started off a little slow. You do have to stay with it as some times you don't know which one is talking. They switch back and fore a lot. That said it was a really good book.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Show was pretty cute. I like the characters and the clothing. Had some good one liners and phrases. Great show.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather channel always teaches you something in addition to the temperature. The meterologists are top notch and exciting on tv as well. Keep your standards up, please!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this is a very fun app and you have to getvit because it is the free kind it might sound cool to everyone even me
B005A1ER0I|5.0|If you like epic, soul stirring music then this is your album.  The genius of this album is that it manages to remain bombastic throughout while not ever really feeling overpowering, unemotional or overly loud.  Im not sure how Thomas Bergersen has done it , but he has managed to convey an epic feeling throughout the album while also conveying the emotions of love, lost and despair.  It truly is great to listen throughout from beginning to end.  I cannot recommend this album enough.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book first and mentioned to my husband what a great book it was. I did not think he would read it because he said it was not his type of book. Next thing I knew he couldn't put it down, just like me. When he finished it we discussed it for days after. It was an excellent book that kept us wanting to read it to find out what happened. We decided to rent the movie since the book was so good. The movie could have been great if only the director would have read the book. The movie was a disappointment but the book was great. Read the book!
B00BLGZN1S|1.0|The quality of the video type rented, DVD video, is not worth the money spent to view it. The video transmission provided was blurry and pixelated. Action sequences were so poorly rendered that made it almost impossible to remain interested. I have rented a number of videos before and seriously doubt I will do so again!!! I'm very disappointed and request a refund or credit posted to my account. It bothers me that I felt compelled to inform you of such a negative opinion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|sure the computer version has way more stuff and you don't get updates very often but other then that this game ROCKS :)
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This weather app is really good looking, accurate and incredibly easy to use. You can set multiple locations and even detect current location as well as week ahead and detailed hourly weather for 24 hours ahead.Get the paid version for no ads and even more usefully techy stuff and more settings options - it's brilliant :)
B007FO5PYK|5.0|Al Pacino is magnificent, and a close 2nd for Chris O'Donnell.  We also thought the Blu-Ray video quality was outstanding.  I suppose the plot, with the word &#34;stretch&#34; attached, is believable, but nevertheless, the movie was very enjoyable and leaves one with a &#34;feel-good&#34; result.  Personally, I would highly recommend this movie in Blu-Ray.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I can honestly say that I have been truly disappointed with music recently.  This is not just because I like rock music and there have been no good rock albums since the last Foo Fighters album.  Primarily because pretty much all albums I have bought in the last year have been a package of 2 - 3 well thought out and executed songs, mixed in with 4 - 5 songs that should never have made anyone's album.<br /><br />This album is amazing, from start to finish.  There is not a single weak effort on this album, and I find myself leaving the album on repeat and listening to it in the background.  There are no less than six or seven songs that capture your imagination and emotion when you hear them.  It is really refreshing to hear such a great album, not just a couple of good songs and the rest being phoned in.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to people who like music in general, this is not a genera specific album.  Its just great.
0307474259|1.0|I would not recommend this book. Too much clinical information and not enough information you can use. Don't waste your money.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Timely novel with today's geo-political problems in the story's forefront!  Today's news is that we do the same as the enemies!
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Amon Amarth has done it again! Fresh yet still retaining all the qualities we love in Amon Amarth - Johan's voice is even more amazing; the guitar work is tastey. The included EP disc has some awesome tracks that demonstrate just how versatile this band truly is. A brutal bludgeoning metal assault! \,,/
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Excellent show I'm On the edge of my seat not knowing what the next scene might be. I also like the actors & their characters very entertaining. Thanks
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app keeps me interested and guessing most of the time. Great for killing time. I truly enjoyed this app.
B0000029GA|5.0|Amazing album, its hard to believe that nas made this album at that young age, he is a legend and one of the greatest of all time.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I heard there is a 4th book. Can't wait.I feel this is is a great three book series. If there is a 4th book, written before he died, I am hoping it continues with the same primary character.<br /><br />Great stuff.
B004C3DLJS|4.0|It was entertaining for the four year old who watched it - and for the 56 year old grandmother who watched it with him!
B002YCVX5S|5.0|A compelling story, great cinematography, an excellent cast of characters (who are all well-played by their actors). All in all, watch this movie!
0060245867|3.0|The cover was dirty with spots which wasn't clear in description. Inside book clean but for the price I would have spent  2 more dollars for new book
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The main character is a doctor who is in a coma and who feels he went to heaven. It was pretty technical.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|My daughter recommended it for me.  This is one crazy movie with a crazy ending.  I'm a huge fan of the first two Underworld movies and this is one I rate up there with them.  The Blu-ray looks beautiful and the sound will blow you out of your seats.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book told the story of how one iincident can change a family.  The characters were memorable. As good as Kite Runner.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I have seen this movie several times.  The first time I watched it I thought it was ok.  But over the years I have grown to love it.  I just bought it on Blu-ray and with my huge LED TV and surround dound system, it rocks my house to the foundation.  Love it!!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Goodfellas ranks right up there with the 1st two Godfather movies.  Goodfellas is the type of movie that when you're cruising through the channels and see it on, you automatically stop surfing and start watching.  Next thing you know you're wondering where the time went.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Probably my most favorite app. Obviously, most people have Facebook in this day and age, and this app works great.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This novel is an interesting insight into a little known episode in American history.  It is told in a novel way about the interactions of a &#34;train rider&#34; and a youthful New England &#34;outsider&#34;.  Vivian, at 91 and preparing for death, wants to take one last look at her lifetime possessions, knowing that once she is dead they will be deposited in a dumpster and her story will never be told.  Molly, a troubled l6 year old masking as a goth figure, is called upon to help Vivian clean out her attic.  Reluctant at first, she finds herself drawn to this old lady and her history.  As the story progresses,each one sees something of herself in the other, and an unspoken bond is formed. Vivian's wisdom and Molly's computer expertise make for a surprise ending.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Like the app, but not a huge tweeter. I've never had any problems with this downloaded app, so I would suggest it to anyone.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Good movie, typical Nicholas Sparks movie,,,,,predictable end though....except for one little thing that caught me off guard completely,,,,,not telling,,,,you have to watch!
B00B769XB8|5.0|3D Action! 3D chills! We missed this at the theaters so I purchased the 3D Blu Ray and am glad I did.<br />A very entertaining 3d movie. We have a 3D HD front projection Home Theater system with a 14ft wide screen which recreates the theater experience at home. We don't have the time to go out and see every movie we would like, so most of the films we see are<br />on blu ray at home ( far more convenient and the pop corn is a lot cheaper!) I'm glad we bought this film. I didn't hear much about it during it's theater run, but we found it entertaining. The set & art direction is very nice. Excellent use of 3D as well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love everything about this show, from the settings, characters, and script.  Bravo!  I just feel so connected to this period in time and am very fascinated by it.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This James Bond movie doesn't dissapoint.  I am a great fan of them and even though it can't be Sean Connery for all of them, they still provide great entertainment.
B0045INOD8|2.0|Is this just some antiwar rant? Are we supposed to believe this is an accurate representation of the American military during the Vietnam era?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The continuing saga of the inhabitants of Downton Abbey succeeds as in past seasons in delivering stunning cinematography and a level of ensemble acting seldom seen in other television series. Phenomenal as usual! The only thing lacking is the ability of Amazon Prime to bring the newer episodes to Prime members for free. Doing so would certainly sweeten the desirability of Amazon Prime membership.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Like all of Vince Flynn's books, this one was nothing short of AMAZING!!!!  The world will miss his literary genius - his death was a terrible loss.  PHENOMENAL!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it and can't wait for season 4.  The acting is superb and I can't pick a favorite character because they are all favorites. 8 episodes a season is not enough.  Give us more!!
B008469DGY|5.0|I am totally hooked on this game. It gets harder and harder as you reach the next golf course. Fun game and addictive. Plan on staying up nights and play by the hours.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I watched the movie twice and now I really want to read the novel.I can see why the movie has good reviews and those who don't get it, don't understand how similar the movie is to the matrix. Even the structure of the film in its multiple layers, like a matrix is brilliant. I have to find this book..but first I want to read the novel and see how close the screenplay was able to capture the essence of the written piece of art.It is rare that artist can cross over from one medium to another and capture the true essence of the work ...in tact...unmolested... Clearly, for me anyway, the theme of reincarnation and life after death rang true..for true-true..loud and clear...as did elements of Buddahism. I got that from the characters from the Big ISLE,tribalism, post-apocalyptic, as well as the slavery overtones. This movie, Lincoln, and Django Unchained seemed all to dwell in bondage and I wonder if the theme of bondage spans the obvious type of bondage but alludes to bondage of the mind as well... Oh yes... complex as it is, this movie is one for the ages... I am not done yet......
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love the Good Wife. I don't always get to see the program on TV at the schedule time so I program to tape all issues. This year the series was preempted several times in our area so I down loaded and reviewed the whold series. Great to know you can get your favorite shows downloaded to your kindle.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was pretty good. Definitely worth a read.. I don't like that I have to write a review of this
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like TWC on tv so I went with this. It does a good job but I also added 2 other types of weather apps and for me they all work together very well. Would not give any of them up either.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Amazing read, however four and five are one book split in two.  This book (4) focuses on Kinglanding characters, and five focuses on the wall, north of the wall and across the sea characters.  The last chapter is an out of story apology or explanation of why he never once talked of Jon, Danny or Stannis.<br />Either way you've read this far in the series my review won't stop or start you so buy this one and keep reading!<br />Our if you haven't read the series go read book one!!  What are you doing starting on four? You're a bad person!
B00CA4S27W|5.0|Just purchased this for my husband for Father's Day.  We listened to it several times over and over, absolutely enjoying it.  The music reminds us of our visits to Renaissance festivals.  We have not watched the DVD yet, but we can't imagine it not being delightful as well.

Supermarkets will be looted clean, woods and forests will be all hunted out,  food is going to be gold.  This approach for a closed self contained food generation system looks like the way to go.

B000I3PA8Q|5.0|With the star trek movies (original cast) they were hit or miss, This is one of then hits, its just a great fun and exciting movie. The first time I saw this I was actually on an Airplane on the way back from a vacation in Hawaii, it was fitting with the Whale being hunted into extinction theme. I just watched it again hear with Amazon prime and I still love it. Its one of the best Star Trek Movies overall any cast.
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|So far fairly impressed with this album.  It reminds me mostly of Warning from the early days, although parts also remind me of Empire and Rage.  The new lead vocalist is very impressive, I can't wait to hear this guy sing Take Hold of the Flame, live!  Scott is rocking the percussion as usual.  With this first effort being so solid, I can't wait to see the next albums from this version of Queensryche.
B003097ABA|5.0|I had all these albums (and cassettes) Back in the day; and on CD I just got the Hits albums, but this is much better. Really every song on all first five albums is great or at least very good. This is an inexpensive way to get all five CDs and also have them as Hard copies and not just own them digitally. Of course I loaded all five up into my I pod.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I generally like the film.  Not perfect but there was enough there for me to keep me glued to the screen.  I have watched it several times.  I love the characters and the story.

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Even being a fan of the old series and all the Trek incarnations, I can't give this a full recommendation.<br />Sure, its great to see all the cast together for another go-round but the writing is what makes this movie not so memorable. Instead of some great character moments, the writers decide to go for over-the-top action instead of the humanity/friendship angle that the original series and movies proved sucessfully.<br />We also get major plot developments here, only to be undone with a reset button twenty minutes to half an hour later. It  cheapens the drama if someone that dies, is brought back to life. If someone's ship is taken away, only to conveniently get it back soon after.<br /><br />My other issue is, that if you are going to reboot something like Trek, don't start redoing movies that have already been done. This movie takes a character from the original series and TWOK and makes him over with far less success (or impact) than the original source material. If you have a clean slate, why can't the writers be a bit more imaginative? Whole scenes are copied and not even well enough to be considered as an homage. It just seems lazy and unnecessary.<br /> They had a couple of years to write this Sequel after the sucessful 2009 movie so it could have been so much more Engaging. What happened in the writers room? We're they more concerned about aiming for a general audience and dumbing it down than giving us some meat along with the action for true Trek Fans.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Works great with my new Mac Mini. This adapter breathes new life into my old Firewire CD burner.<br /><br />Definitely worth it.

B00BX8PG5M|4.0|It used to be that Hollywood knew a thing or two about producing some outstanding, patriotic military thrillers.  I'm not talking about the drum-beating variety; rather, I'm talking about stories that focused on characters with a commitment to whatever country they served, and these characters would then be allowed to carry out their mission at whatever the cost.  That's the stuff audiences typically embrace - not these veiled anti-war, anti-American, anti-decency dramatic potboilers.  If you'd told me twenty years ago that I'd have to watch a film about a Soviet submarine captain who does what's necessary to save all of humanity in order to have that thirst for solid military drama sated, then I would've told you to drop down and give me twenty.<br /><br />(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)<br /><br />In the late 60's, a battle-tested Soviet submarine captain nearing the end of his career, Demi (played by the reliable Ed Harris) returns to base only to find out he's been assigned to command a relic: an old diesel sub is on the verge of being retired and sold to the Chinese for their new navy.  His senior officer thinks it apropos that Demi - who first captained the sub - see it through on its last mission, and, a consummate professional, he agrees.  However, once they're out to see, Demi finds his authority usurped a KGB officer, Bruni (David Duchovny), who's intent on using the ship to test a new naval weapon known only as `Phantom.'  Once it becomes clear that Bruni is privately committed to launching a nuclear warhead at the US's Pacific Fleet, Demi fights his own personal demons on his bid to retake the sub with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.<br /><br />PHANTOM is a smartly written and expertly directed project (credit Todd Robinson for both) that's entirely based on true events.  In fact, the Soviet sub that went down in the late 60's has been raised and recovered, but, until this day, both the Russian government and the U.S. protect its records at the highest level of classification.  As I said in my opening, I'm a sucker for a good, patriotic actioner - regardless of who is calling the shots - and this one was pretty spectacular.<br /><br />At the center of it all is some exceptional photography with sets depicting diesel sub interiors of the era.  Everything is tightly shot by design, and the lighting and period detail only adds to the visual drama.  Furthermore, the production is held up on Harris's capable shoulders; he plays the captain with tremendous reserve (until fisticuffs become necessary), and that's because the script brilliant shackles the character with some personal baggage that takes the shape of some very dark secrets.  He's also suffering from a physical condition - one that he's kept from those closest to him - that plays heavily into the second half.<br /><br />To add to the expertise, Robinson brought in a stable of familiar and highly-skilled actors to add even more gravitas to the project.  The exceptional William Fichtner plays Alex, the sub's executive officer.  Lance Henriksen appears briefly as Admiral Markov - the officer who tasks Demi with this mission (and them suffers his own dark comeuppance).  Johnathon Schaech - while shackled under a mustache honestly too thick for his face - also serves under Harris's captain, and Jason Beghe as Semak earns stripes as the ship's doctor.  A personal long-time favorite of mine since his stint as Indiana Jones on television, Sean Patrick Flanery shows up as weapon's expert Tyrtov.<br /><br />If PHANTOM has any failings, I'd have to point my finger at its uncharacteristically schmaltzy ending, which sacrifices the gritty reality of the first 90 minutes for a saccharin and sappy closing scene that serves no real purpose other than to bring in a few, fresh faces to cleanse the palate of all the film's sweaty manliness.  It was entirely unnecessary - I'm not sure what Robinson was thinking when he wrote it - and it could've been played several different ways that wouldn't have pitched reality out the window in favor of a few minutes of benign fantasy.<br /><br />PHANTOM is produced by RCR Media Group, Trilogy Entertainment Group, and Solar Filmworks.  DVD distribution is being handled through 20th Century Fox.  As for the technical specifications, I'm willing to guess no expense was spared in bringing this tale of seasoned bravery to life; it's filled with constantly claustrophic cinematography aboard a Soviet diesel submarine, and it looks marvelous.  (Having toured two Cold War subs similar to the sets used in this film, I thought it extremely accurate in its depictions.)  Lastly, the Blu-ray package offers up the real deal: along with the film there's a digital copy that you can watch anywhere; three production shorts; a music video; and an audio commentary.  Bravo to all involved for pitching in with some impressive extras!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Before Hollywood went all political with its military thrillers, it served up classic-style heroes - old soldiers, old captain, old warriors - who knew a thing or two about facing the odds and saving the world.  Despite a curiously sentimental, fantastical ending, PHANTOM remains a tautly plotted motion picture are big men facing bigger odds.  Based on true events (and probably a fair amount of screenwriter tinkering), the story focuses in on a battle of wills between an aging relic of Soviet supremacy (Ed Harris) and a KGB operative (David Duchovny) who'll stop at nothing to set the world on a path to global apocalypse.  It'd be easy to quip some of the minor details, but PHANTOM is man's entertainment, and there ain't no bones about that.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RCR Media Group and 20th Century Fox provided me with a DVD copy of PHANTOM by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.es the gritty reality of the first 90 minutes for a saccharin and sappy closing scene that serves no real purpose other than to bring in a few, fresh faces to cleanse the palate of all the film's sweaty manliness.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  I would recommend it to adults- not really appropriate for children- scary, some sex stuff, but a great read.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|You may need to have read the novel for the film to hang together. The novel is a great favorite of mine, and the film adaptation reminded me why. I watched the film with three others. The one who had read the book enjoyed the film as much as I did, but the other two, who hadn't read it, didn't like it as much.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but not so hard you wanted to give up. Looking forward to new levels!!  Good game for a free game. Hurry with the new stuff I really enjoyed these floors!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As always, the cast of Downton Abbey does a great job. This is the most dramatic season yet and I highly recommend it.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Being a large fan of the TV show I thought I'd start reading the books that inspired it. I wasn't disappointed and will be reading more. This is the first of the series, and I suspect that the author gets a lttle smoother in his story telling as he progresses. There were a few transitions of scene that I had a little difficulty following and had to be several pages into the new scene to get a bearing as to where I was. Happened two or three times. But characters are well drawn, action believable, and story interesting. I would recommend to anyone looking for a new character driven mystery series. And if you happen to like western settings, so much the better.

B000N6U0DS|5.0|After I heard about this movie, I got it and it showed me, that trully in this great country you can achieve whatever you want to. Just work hard for it and you'll get it. Great actors anda very good footage.
B000VBP382|5.0|If you have never seen this version of Pride and Prejudice, you need to take the time to watch this movie.  Great cinematography, superb acting, and a classic story.  A real must.  The extras that are included in this gift set are well worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is really awesome you can craft and build destroy and there are mods but be careful so it's not a waste of time and money
B006VREHRS|4.0|Ordinarily sows/movies from this time period do not &#34;grab&#34; me as there is too much frenetic flapper focus - this show instead has focus on power players and the &#34;downstairs folks&#34; and development of incremental government corruption.  Perhaps one could say it is allegorical to current events... Put the kiddies to bed before watching - they won't get and would likely be distracting. Good cinematography and sets, good character development. Worth watching, just don't expect &#34;The Wire&#34;.
0740748475|5.0|I bought the hardback set and it is very nice!!  The pages are stitched and the books are very heavy.  I gave this to my husband for our anniversary and he loves it.  The collection sits on our mantle!
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|This is like a painting that has come to life.<br /><br />I also have the Blu-Ray version and it is sooo sharp!<br /><br />It's like being in a colorful and artistic world.<br /><br />These words describe it: sensual, dreamy, colorful, acrobatic, enchanted musical<br /><br />I've seen Cirque Du Soleil in Las Vegas called Mystere and I've seen other traveling shows but this<br /><br />movie has some acrobatics that I have not seen before and they are IMPRESSIVE.<br /><br />My favorite parts are:<br /><br />- trapeze artists that slide down and catch each other's falls by their feet to feet upside down to<br /><br />each other<br />- the 4 Chinese girls who bend over backwards and stack on each other.<br />- about half way through the movie, the girl in the half glass bowl was very sensual<br />- the 4 Beatles acts now make me want to see the Las Vegas Beatles Cirque Du Soleil.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I travel a lot and it is always nice to be able to check the weather for whatever place I am going to or my home area.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know their local weather in real time.
1609611543|4.0|Page 210 of the kindle version, under 'Consume in Unlimited Quantities\\" he lists white vinegar, worcestershire sauce and soy sauce (although later he correctly lists them as gluten-containing) As a 20-year celiac who continued to have problems after eliminating glutinous grains from my diet and later discovering the hidden glutinous content of these three, I was rather surprised.  Otherwise, I enjoyed the book and recommend it to friends.
B009GEDP26|4.0|Good season-long story arc for Castle and Beckett's relationship.<br /><br />A couple odd episodes detract from what would otherwise be a 5-star experience.
B001AQO3QA|1.0|If your blu - ray player is not 2013 or 14 it will not play these properly regardless of software updates.
B001TH16DI|5.0|All the movies look better,now! I like the slim jackets..Blu-ray packaging is getting better,smaller. The book package format  should be the new standard for Blu-ray movie sets. Like the Indiana Jones,or Star Wars  Sets.They take up the least space of all packaging.. I just wished Star Trek the motion picture director cut was included in this set..That would have made this better.
B000FC130E|5.0|i enjoy Neil Gaiman's books very much.  They are literate, insightful, good humored and provocative.  This one i particularly like because it is a fine example of Gaiman's ability to highlight the humor and the potential horrors of everyday life ... and what might lay just beneath the surface of the daily routine.  This is both literally and figuratively true in this novel.  The characters are compelling, colorful and sympathetic. They resonate with mythic archetype in a way that is refreshing rather than cliche.  The world that Gaiman creates beneath the streets of London is imaginative, fully conceived and convincing.  Even the secondary characters suggest the wonder and woe of that world.  I read the novel when it first appeared and recently finished a second reading.  I was no less engaged by the second reading and picked up on small details that i missed the first time through.  I recommend the book highly as great read, a rousing adventure, and a thoughtful reflection on where meaning and mission is to be found in modern life.  A sequel would be welcomed.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|&#34;Missiles! Jets! Tanks! It's still the guy with guts and a gun who wins the war!&#34;<br /><br />One: There aren't any missiles, jets, or tanks in this movie (might be tanks, I can't recall). We're talking World War I here. It was made in 1941, granted, but the MOVIE is about World War I. We all laughed when the DVD arrived.<br /><br />Two: He doesn't &#34;win the war&#34;, but Sergeant York was a great WWI hero. This film tells a deep and compelling story about a man who came to love God and wanted to serve Him faithfully, yet his beliefs eventually collide with the fact that a soldier must kill to protect his country. A man of faith, courage, and great strength, Sergeant York was a true hero.<br /><br />So, 0 stars for the cover designer, whoever you may be. 10 stars for the film!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love this game fun to play and challenges the mind. some levels a little tricky with more than one room but still fun to play
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great detail and graphics.  My lil ones are learning while having a great time.  Looking forward to future levels and more competitions.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Excellent movie, well paced. Keeps viewer involved. Informs viewer about life of an important historical person and events that changed mankind for the better.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|Well written.  Well acted.  Newman and Redford are outstanding as Butch and Sundance.  One of the best westerns of all times.  Everyone will enjoy this movie.
B00BUCXVPI|2.0|Gee if some crook Russian mob wants someone killed they will do it KISS - Keep It Simple and Systematic! Well at least this time Tom Cruise doesn't sprint!
B00AKO93JK|3.0|Downloaded it as FAD but I just opened it once, the interface is pretty rugged, not something I'd use, I wouldn't buy this app.
B000TS5CME|5.0|Great movie and music. The only issue I had with it is that the sound is a bit subdued otherwise a great movie.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|could be more flexible on tablets. iron man keeps pulling to the right during the game and doesn't balance out too well
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Finally was able to watch all the 23 episodes in three days via Amazon Instant Video.I was so invested on Beauty and the Beast that I didn't know what I was missing.It's the best show so far that has come out of the CW.Arrow has that Batman-esque feel to it.Can't wait for second season and see what will become of Roy Harper ,will he don a red suit,and will he continue seing Thea?How about Laurel Lance's relationship with Oliver Queen?Tommy Merlin dead?I don't think so! So for those who failed the city...Arrow will come for you!
B009LDMJBU|4.0|Eros is one of my favorite Italian artist, but this album is one the best yet. Can't wait for his next work.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a fun book to read.  I loved all the twists and turns in it.  Hope to read more by Gillian Flynn.
078689136X|4.0|Loved it! Seriously, if you like the series, then these books are just your thing, especially if you have a deep appreciation of irony. The only thing that bothered me is how cold, and sometimes even a little cruel, Heat is with Rook.  However, that bothers me in the TV series, as well. I think its even more apparent in the books, though - because we're privy to Heat's interior dialogue. And thankfully, at least in the books you have the satisfaction of Heat And Rook actually coming together - even if their romance is a bit on again, off again.<br /><br />I love the concept - reading a book by a fictional author based on characters in a TV series. Maybe not novel, but definitely well executed. These books remind me a little of the Stephanie Plum series - fun, easy reads with (mostly) likable characters, a good story line, plenty of excitement, and just enough sex to make you want more!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|started out pretty easy..then had to grab a notepad to write down clues but kept me very entertained for several hours..I couldn't stop!!!

B005JS7VTQ|5.0|You could not ask for more for the price.  Five super albums from the Doobies; no more digging thru my collection, because it is all in one place now. Each CD comes in it's own cardboard holder and the sound is great on all the discs!
B0082Z1CVQ|2.0|It was pretty good  it was a little boring wasn't the best.if you like Anne of green gables then you should like this book
0307891372|5.0|If you loved this game then you needed this to be an ultimate knight. I got this before everybody had the game online mapped out. Great game and the book to go find it all. It's exhausting to cover this much with out some kind of assistance.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|How do you make a boring Die Hard?<br /><br />He didn't even kill a plane.  While the return to an R rating bore promise, there just wasn't enough to this movie.
B00BJ64FU0|4.0|I had no idea that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote such developed and diverse characters and original plots. These are far richer than those simplified, watered-down and abridged &#34;children's classics&#34; I was fed as a kid in school.  I wish I'd read the unadulterated versions sooner. Catching up now!
B004EK91LQ|5.0|I love this movie it fits with the others. Moose is cool and brings everything together. The music is amazing as is the dancing.
B008220D5K|1.0|I like the actors in this movie, but I hated the movie.  I watched it all the way through, but it never redeemed itself.  I was not amused with the toilet humor (literally) and glib tone.  I would recommend choosing another movie.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Neil Gaiman is an incredible novelist, but he's not the most prolific writer, so fans like myself have long dry stretches between books.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is great, introducing characters and ideas that seem delightful. The book is set in the English countryside mid-20th century. It's packed with whimsical fantasy, a light touch of adult ideas (really the book is more YA than adult), and a main character that most people reading Neil Gaiman books will empathize with (book nerd, no friends).<br /><br />Here's my issue, though. It was kind of short and not as grand an adventure as I wanted.  Maybe it's because I bought it on the Kindle so I had no real idea of the 'width' of the book, but I was settling in for a good long novel, something along the lines of Neverwhere or at least Stardust, when I realized the book was almost over already.  This isn't really the author's fault, he states that he started to write a short story and it got away from him. But he has ROOM in this book that he COULD have made it an epic. He just didn't.  I don't know, maybe he's getting too used to the kids' length books he's been producing.<br /><br />If you're a fan of his work, you'll enjoy this because hey, it's Neil Gaiman. But if you're like me, this won't quench your thirst.  By all means, read it, and then go re-read American Gods or something.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It was a very good movie, but the picture quality was not very good. i'm not sure why. thank You !
B0050XFY4O|4.0|I loved this movie though I did not honesty read a review. The photo caught my eye and snap, I rented. I loved the story.The emotions were intense. I never understood sex with siblings, but this story is about emotion and need. This was a thought provoking and entertaining movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved both of his other books and this one was no different. The story lines are complex but you are instantly drawn into the families and the stories they weave together. This was just a beautiful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves to read. Fantastic. Five stars easily. Couldn't put it down.
B007SGM084|5.0|I've never been a reader,but with this series I couldn't put down!!!  It pulled me in and I could actually imagine in my head like a movie playing as I read it.  I recommend reading this trilogy cause you, like me will not be able to put it down ; )
B000002U82|1.0|Someone really screwed up the masters on this or something because it sounds like crap.  I have a live concert DVD of Pink Floyd doing \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" in its entirety and it sounds ten times better than this studio recording.  Maybe they got some cheap Chinese crap mass production facility making this?  Maybe it doesn't sound as bad on an MP3 from all the dynamic range compression, but put it on an audiophile sound system (or my PC or DVD portable player) and you will know what I mean.  A lot of audiophiles think the younger generations are not into hi-fi sound and they would not know the difference between (arguably) lame MP3s and good hi-fi sound.  I just think you have to hear a good hi-fi rig and you will know.  We can always use more audiophiles in the hobby.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every so often, a fantasy/sci-fi writer comes along with a truly unique concept. The Dune series and the Harry Potter series come to mind as great examples of this.  The Hunger Games, in my mind, falls into the same category. In addition, the Hunger Games series speak with a profound social conscience, demonstrating the horrors of war as they affect children. This series is action packed while, at the same time, being very eye-opening. That is a rare and refreshing combination.<br /><br />Kevin P White (award-winning author)
B002FE5XVK|5.0|A 1983 lampoon at the way things have degenerated.  A show that starts out slow and gets totally intense as it goes on.  Mr. Byrne's big suit shows what it looks like when business and government leaders (i.e. the suits) get to big for their britches and need to be taken down a peg or two with some fun.  The music movie made a big splash in theaters when released and now is now available for home viewing on blu-ray DVD.  Great songs like &#34;Psycho Killer&#34;, &#34;Burning Down the House&#34; and &#34;Take Me To the River&#34;, etc. which you may have heard.  I like the lyrics, &#34;This is not my beautiful life, this is not my beautiful house, this is not my beautiful wife&#34;…&#34;How did I get here?&#34; etc.  Good for every blu-ray/DVD music video collection. Greatest hits intense live music from the Talking Heads.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is great for adults and kids. My 7 year old is better at this game than I am.<br />We have fun with this game.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Some people think this is me from the cover art and \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" song, so I don't know what to say.  Greg Lake is a great singer and he even played this song as part of Emerson, Lake and Palmer on one of the live CDs.  I like the whole album-every song.  But hey, I really like \\"Larks Tongue in Aspic\\" by King Crimson too and I am pretty sure that is an acquired taste.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool game. This can consume hours every time you play. Very addictive. My daughter loves to play, and she learns problem solving skills.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Great 70's progressive rock group of unique style-great everything vocals, organ, piano, sound effects etc.  Very clear live recording that captures their energy.  Guitar strings and piano sound like pure tones plucking and plinking in my ears.  Every song is a winner.  Live recording sounds so high quality that I think it might be the closest live recording to sound like a studio recording that I can recall at the moment.  Love the Winston Churchill WWII Battle-of-Britain (fantastical underdog air battle victory) inspirational speech, &#34;We will fight them on the beaches…We will never surrender&#34; with the London church bells ringing out inspiration.
B004KPX5GC|5.0|The ending gives a summary about all the players and what happened with them after the big triple crown race but it doesn't give a summary of the rest of Secretariat's life.
B005HS00ZU|5.0|Peter is on the cutting edge again just like the first digital recording only now it is a 3D video concert with an orchestra. Some of Peter Gabriels' coolest songs done without rock and roll instruments like electric guitar and bass guitar if you can imagine that.  As always a cool show with him on vocals backed up by the New Blood orchestra.  It comes across magically, with lots of dynamics and intensity, and stage show presence.  What can you say? It is Peter at his finest always.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Not bad, could use some minor improvements. Overall pretty fun and it is free. Lots of picture options to choose from.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the most suspenseful and gripping TV shows I have seen, once you start watching, you won't be able to stop!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Such a great show!  I fell in love with the characters in Season 1.  Season 2 gets more serious than the first season and I love it even more!  Seriously just can't stop watching!
0316067598|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who appreciates our armed forces and what they do. Luttrel gives the reader a sobering firsthand account of the war on terror, the elite ability of SEALs, and explains how the US liberal media distorts the reality of the situation.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great show for all ages!<br />These days, with so little appropriate for kids and parents to watch together, it is awesome to find a  show that everyone can watch together!  It truly is a British version of LH on the Prairie!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you're into sci-fi, 80s pop culture, or just good books in general, this one's definitely got something for you.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Sent it to a friend for her birthday, because that is what she specifically asked for.  She said it's just as good as she remembers!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|this quircky game is adorable. very solid design very well made. lots of fun with many lvls.  (also should mention this game is 100% historically accurate. and really could be filed under educational)
B000002GEY|5.0|This was one of my favorites from my teenage years.  I had the original on cassette, but the tape broke in the tape player.  I now have a permanent replacement!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|lots of fun! Definately need more challenges!! Can't wait. level eight was pretty difficult. had my 10 year old help me.
1623420148|5.0|I loved this..I loved it so much I bought 2 copies, one for work and one for home.It is written from the male POV but also in a way that Drew is talking to YOU, yes you the reader. I found that format fresh. His male insight was at times so freaking funny and I'm a sucker for an arrogant man. Katherine is so strong and ambitious, the perfect compliment to Drew. The chemistry between Katherine and Drew is electric. I want to thank Emma Chase for bringing these two in my life, I'm sure this is one I will be re-reading several times. Do yourself a favor and read this book!
