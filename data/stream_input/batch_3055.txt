B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The game may appear simple, but it provides some challenges. I really enjoyed the poking, twisting and providing in the game. Utilizing the motion control on the device was also a great feature.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think it Is good because it shows what you a adding,multiplying,subtraction,division etc. As well the numbers are very big and you can see them clear.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Good Flick: Good action film in tradition of the Twilight Zone.  The DVD is such a good copy, I doubt if there is a need to buy the Blue Ray.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|not much more to say  but there was nothing to it. It it would have been done 10 years ago we may have admired the CGI.  In 2013 there is nothing to this movie at all.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Veronica Roth is an amazing, beautiful writer. I immensely enjoyed the first Divergent book. The second one, not so much, but I hoped she would pick things up in the third book. She did. However, I have a rule about endings (if I say what that is, it'll give away too much). I wouldn't have read any of the series if I had know how it was going to end.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|The camera has great editing and things if the sort and the videos save ,but putting it on let's say facebook ,it takes over 24 hours to download or it doesn't at all.A little much for the camera ,but if your interested pick this up.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|DVD arrived quickly, in great shape.  Little daughter loves to dance to the music of &#34;the Birdies&#34;. Now I understand the Angry irds game better.
0026009102|5.0|...at last, I own a hardback copy of the paperback given to me anonymously and with cover removed in a New York bar (Murphys, 2nd & 51st) over 30 years ago! A fellow drinker and local overheard me and a friend talking with English accents about our architectural careers! Took a while to find out what it was..... Worth the wait - as absorbing now as it was then....
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|amazing book!! inspiring and emotional and tear jerking all at the same time!! a definite must read!!!! loved this book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that the best way to make a difference is that you can see the best way to do  the first place of the most popular stories of the best possible to make.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|The DVD was in great shape, arrived quickly, and my almost three year old little girl loves it.  She is always asking for &#34;the fishies&#34; movie.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Finally a mahjong game where the tiles are big enough for my nearly 60 year old eyes to see without strain. I am looking for games my 89 year old mom might enjoy and this may fill the bill. Thanks!
1476727651|1.0|I have literally just finished reading Doctor Sleep and felt compelled to throw my thoughts into the already over saturated collection. This will be included in my list of The Worst Books I Have Ever Read. I recently was looking at King's bibilography to see where I bailed as a fan. It was \\"IT\\" that was the last straw. In Doctor Sleep are all the elements that drove me away. Even as a stand alone novel it is dreadful. It plods along filling page after page with pointless scenes that could have easily been condensed. The AA stuff goes on for an interminable length. Have you ever read a book and felt that the characters were merely confections to sell a product like characters in a commercial who speak lines that only \\"written\\" people would speak? I never cared for anyone in this book. They were one in all dull and one dimensional. The razor-thin story plods along with no tension or (most importantly) scares and the final thirty pages are absolutely pointless. When one comes to the end (and you will know it when it happens) close the book, the story (meager as it is) is over. Stephen Kinf seems to write in bulk and is the Costco of literature. How can anyone write so poorly and have an audience? It is a stunningly bad sequel to The Shining. I can already envision it to be an excruciating multi-part mini series directed by Mick Garris with jaw-dropping CGI effects like in the TV version of The Shining. Let's hope he never writes a sequel to 'Salem's Lot (still my favorite Stephen King book) and leave best alone.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like to read so this book was  great it help me to get better at reading faster so that is why I give five stars.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|My wife was as happy with the movie as our little girl is.  She was born in Bangkok and watching Julie Andrews movies helped her in learning English.  She still loves to watch it.  DVD arrived in great shape.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|Lover, moi. What a wonderful album with sonic silver bullet to boot!.<br />Great one for any one!<br />Yeah!! Go ahead and but it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I always wondered what would have happened to little Danny Torrance from The Shining! I have always loved Stephen King, and was not disappointed this time!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited finally on kindle....woooot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can't wait for it to finish down loading.  Finally is the only word I can say.
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|This app didn't offer anything special in regards to giving me the weather. Also the last page of the app was in fact links to other apps the company sells. I uninstalled it pretty quickly and never looked back.
B000002O3I|3.0|Not the greatest recording, sonically. So you can tell I am an audiophile.<br /><br />Yeah!! Go ahead and but it if you like music for its sake!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Although it is an awesome device, but it lacks the compatibility of most programs and apps.<br /><br />If more company can make this device more useful, it would be perfect.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|This is one of the best shows to ever be on network television. I had to buy it the moment it came out. All of the special features are great. I also enjoyed being able to watch the cancelled episode in its entirety
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|There should be a rule for screen adaptations of great books that screenwriters should be required to stick to the original plotlines. Extraneous nonsense should not be allowed under penalty of being fed to the orcs. Disney productions have been infamous for breaking this unwritten rule in the pursuit of \\"cute\\" so that stories like [[ASIN:B003A83VUK Alice in Wonderland]] were ruined for me before I could even read. The Hobbit breaks it in pursuit of pretensions of grandeur and will sour the story for generations of children to come.<br /><br />Sure there is great scenery. I mean, who could not like a film made on the south island of New Zealand. Some scenes are true to the book. I most liked the dishwashing scene during the unexpected party, with its musical rendition of the song of \\"That's What Bilbo Baggins Hates\\". In fact the music is the strongest positive all through the whole movie. The trolls' dialog is really funny as is much of the humorous byplay. Elves are beautiful. Gandalf is inscrutable. Wargs are scary. Et cetera. But we all know the positives since they are the same lines we memorized 40 or 50 years ago when we re-read the book for the tenth time.<br /><br />That is about all the positive. For the negative I'll be brief, mostly with questions. A retrospective from the time of the birthday party? Frodo? Why insert dark material from the backstory? And what the hell are the Disney-esque brown wizard and his rabbits doing except wasting our time? A one armed semi-immortal Orc and a morbidly obese orc? Ten minutes of dancing mountains? Did he borrow the orc village from an Indiana Jones movie? Yeah. Right.<br /><br />The Hobbit is the Hobbit, not [[ASIN:0345325818 The Silmarillion]] nor [[ASIN:0544003411 The Lord of the Rings]]. These are three separate works. Imagine dropping an hour of King Lear into a movie remake of Romeo and Juliet and you get my point.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but [[ASIN:054792822X The Hobbit; or, There and Back Again]] isn't an epic novel. It is a children's story, meant to be read aloud to small children and to be an easy read for pre-teens. It is paced to introduce children to Tolkien's world not strangle them with drama. It delivers the backstory sparingly and in small bites, it is tightly written and well thought out. Its narration voice is not omniscient nor does it try to introduce themes beyond the limitations of its main character.<br /><br />The entire point of \\"The Hobbit\\" is the idea that little people who have little goals and little abilities can still do great things if they believe in themselves. All the epic background events and deep history are meant to be deep in the background and not meant to take over the story line. It doesn't mix up the chain of events and it tells more with every re-reading. The movie misses this entirely.<br /><br />This would have made a 4 or 5 star 30 minute first third of a 90 minute movie, leaving the delusions of grandeur on the cutting room floor. As it is, it is barely 3 stars and Bilbo's story is lost in the epic. I expect this problem to worsen instead of improving as we slog through the next two slow painful sequels.novel.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I get that Roth was trying to be edgy and nontypical but really?!? The whole book is ridiculous, from Evelyn to the ending its forced and just horrible. I seriously wish I never started this series. I will not recommend this series to anyone and will apologize to the ones I have already! Such a huge disappointment! :'(
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This story line was so inspiring. Really enjoyed this film. One of my favorites. Couldn't of asked for a better performance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome for anyone who really loves horses and even adults will love it I'm sure you will absolutely love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Gotta say that this game is truly osem. Plenty of games out there to chose from. But if you are looking for a really good time waster, go with this.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was a pretty good book. If I were to choose I would not have ended the book that way but I still liked it. Just to warn you though be prepared to cry and have tissues around because you will  need them.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|I chose this rating because I loved this movie. Although hard to watch and very intense. Was an excellent movie and brilliantly exicuted
B002RI9MWA|5.0|The author tells his story to a silent dinner guest. Written as a monologue, his is the only voice and we hear his most intimate feelings, thoughts and doubts as the facts unfold and we can feel him being drawn inexorably towards the story's climax. Gripping!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I gave it a 3 because it was working perfect at first then it started crashing everytime I went to load a video so I deleted it and..............yeah!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I thought it was a very good book because I thought I had mystery solved and I was totally wrong.  I would love to read the other two books written by this author.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|Fiio E17 performance is very good. It improves the sound and quality of headphones quite well. My main complaint however is the usb charge takes forever and the fully charged unit doesn't last all that long. It's almost necesary to leave it plugged in to charge it all the time when not in use. The charge issue almost renders it unuseable. I would rather use an AC adapter similar to the one that can be used with an ipod or even pay to keep replacing batteries. Also the instruction booklet is almost useless. It can be figured out, but with more trouble than it should.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|good timer easy to set up. Alarm working flawlessly it kept me on time to work every day. Love it love it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|****SPOILERS****<br /><br />I read an interview that Roth did on the Philosophy of Character Death.  This quote: \\"I think it's a good thing that the characters I \\"kill\\" are ones we're all attached to, so that those deaths are not gratuitous.\\"  made me really nervous for the last book, but never did I think she would kill of TRIS!!!!  In that interview she continues to explain that she believes death is important in writing, she then references Harry Potter and how we would never know how truly evil Voldemort was without death.  Ok I get why she thinks this, but what lesson do we learn from Tris' death?<br /><br />Don't read this book!  Really the whole story was awful. We find out that Tobias only has 4 fears and Caleb is emotionally void because they are \\"genetically mutated\\" Really?  Being Divergent means they are just normal. Of all the directions this series could have went and we find out it was all due to a government administered genetics experiment. I hated that and was disappointed from the very start of the book! Tori dies on their way out of the city, and a few pages later we find out her brother has actually been alive the whole time! So why has he never tried to get to Tori?  All these people on the \\"outside\\" could only save a couple people?  I just didn't like the turn it took and it really did drrrraaagg on! Then Tris dies saving CALEB!  Really??  As if that isn't enough, then they all stand around while Uri is pulled off life support!!!  The only time this book wasn't boring was when it was devastating.  The epilogue ends with Tobias alone and sad, but he learns the important lesson \\"life goes on\\"<br /><br />We all know bad things happen Ms Roth!!  It is not powerful to attach us to characters and then meaninglessly kill them off, it's mean.  If Harry Potter had died, the series would have sucked... But Harry wasn't killed off and I guess that's why JK Rowling is still a successful writer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Could not wait for this game to be available on kindle fire. Works great and I am not surprised at the ratings from the other three thousand plus people.  NOW I WANT BEJEWELED THREE!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love Chris Pine...he is a perfect young Kirk.<br /><br />I think that says it all, but Amazon wants more words in this review before I can submit it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am super excited that this is finally available. I can now play on the go with a bigger screen, my phone is kinda small...lol
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once I pick it up, I never stop (until I run out of lives). I've been waiting for Candy Crush to come out for the kindle and now it here!
B00EQ30RVY|1.0|The music is decent, at best, but despite the name slapped on the album, this is NOT STP. Listening to the songs, you can tell that this band is greatly suffering from the absence of Scott, and I recommend saving your money and not buying this mess.<br /><br />Scott can be hard to be work with, and he has his issues - if he is no longer part of the band, then so be it. It majorly sucks, as STP as a authentic foursome has made some of the best music out there, but it is what it is.<br /><br />However, for the band to carry on without him and still keep the STP name is laughable, pathetic, selfish on the part of the remaing three members, and an overall major slap in the face to all of the bands' long-time fans. Simply put, without Scott as the frontman, this band is NOT STP!<br /><br />If the band changes its name, start a new band and build from there, I will absolutely support them (assuming that the music isn't horrible). However, I refuse to support this band the way it is right now, as do many, many others.
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|I have more complex notepad apps but when this came up as the free app of the day, I jumped for it. I wanted something utterly simple with no fancy features for things like shopping lists. This app does what I wanted.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A fun game that is easy to play, but challenging enough to keep you interested. It connects with Facebook so you can play with friends too. You don't have to buy anything and there aren't annoying ads either. My kids even love it!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was quite an unusual story that had an excellent balance of real world history, family tragic history, mystery and loss leading to agonising despair that held suspense just long enough to then resolve into a sense of wonder and joy, and then the awful risk that what was wonderful might be destroyed for ever...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This has the perfect amount of challenge. It's not too hard but keeps me guessing a lot too. Best escape game I've played yet.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I owned the previous version of this BBC production, the one that hadn't been restored, and this one is SO much better, quality-wise. The colors are vivid and true, unlike the somewhat yellowy tint that I always noticed on the previous version. Also, as a really great plus, this version actually has subtitles, which the previous version didn't.<br /><br />And of course, the story, acting, and overall movie is just so wonderful. It's nice to see a restored version that does this fine production justice.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is the best alam ever I'm a hevy sleeper and this wakes me up #01 if you get up you do if you don't there's something wrong
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I don't really understand why there are so many negative reviews. I just finished this series and although, I cried like a baby in the last couple chapters I really enjoyed the twist. I would have loved a happy ending, but let's be honest of course Tris sacrificed herself that's who she is. A selfless, brave, and strong person.<br /><br />I gave it 4  stars because the middle of the book was a bit slow and kind of repetitive. There is actions it just takes a while to get to it.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I finally got to see it in 3D.  I saw it in theaters, but had laser eye surgery, so I had to wait.<br /><br />The features are good as well.  Marvel's been doing great on those.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is even more fun than even the Facebook version. I`m finally finished waiting, and so very pleased to be able to play on my Kindle Fire. This has better graphics than I expected, and syncs within Facebook so I don`t miss a level. Bravo, King, well done.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Outstanding drama. Can't wait until next season. We love this show. Keep this on amazon. We want to find another great drama on amazon
B001XUKFAQ|3.0|To slow streaming for hd need to work on faster stream I have 50 mg and a was really low quality
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone was talking about how much fun Candy Crush is, so I had to have it. I am really glad I purchased it. Colors and graphics are great, but I really enjoy the game. Almost addictive!
B00005Q45W|4.0|I've enjoyed nearly every Leonard Cohen album since I first heard him in the early seventies. This album is no exception and contains a couple of really great songs, though it's not quite as consistent as some of the others. For the truly best of his work I recommend &#34;Various Positions&#34;. That record brought tears to my eyes and still moves me every time I listen to it, even now after many years. &#34;Ten New Songs&#34; is not nearly as deep or as powerful, it's just very pleasant to listen to.
B004RLEBTY|5.0|Awesome.  If you liked their first album you'll like this one for sure.  They videos are a hoot too.  Buy it now.  The first 4 songs are solid!
0671646788|5.0|Hi guys this is real book which must be read at least once  in life. Its a great wisdom and covers variety of different aspects of life.......Good stuff to be a good  leader, to be a nice manager, a good human being & to be rich...........This book will teach you to have great interpersonal skills.....the language is  simple, realistic and so natural that each word is absorbed by your mind......a well written and balanced book.....I will call it a Real gem I ever got  till date.......MUST BUY & MUST  READ FOR EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO EXCEED  IN LIFE.<br /><br />Good luck
B00E97AZZK|5.0|This was pretty fun to watch and kept me guessing. The actors all did great and the tricks were fun and sometimes funny to watch.
B001QL5MAA|5.0|This is the first instalment in a series which, for me, redefined Science Fiction past and present. The author manages to blend creative & exciting physics & technological concepts and engaging character development into a muli-part masterpiece which is truly spectacular. I've read nearly all of his work and have yet to be even slightly disappointed.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I chose the five star rating because this movie nearly scared the pants off me and I'm not afraid of much.  The house in the country is a dream........and it's definitely haunted!  And then the people become the haunters.  The devil lives in that house and it's going to take whoever it can and use them for its own means.<br /><br />The acting is superb, even the children.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of horror and suspense because it will keep you on the edge of your seat and hanging on for dear life because you're not real sure when you will also become haunted,  Don't watch it at night and for sure don't watch it ALONE at night.  You won't get any sleep!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Excellent movie from beginning to the end. Cast and crew keep you spellbound throughout the movie. Action packed and a great plot.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Not as good as the first Iron Man but better than part two and entertaining enough. As always Downey Jr. sells the movie more than anyone else.
0449000729|5.0|I was in my grandparents' living room, thirteen years old, and saw this book laying on the coffee table.  A tome, almost a thousand pages, no dust jacket to clue me in to the content.  I picked it up and opened to the first page:  \\"First, before the beginning of Sarum, the world was a colder and darker place......\\"  That was it for me, I was in.  I devoured the book with abandon, nevermind the occasional sentence that runs on for a whole paragraph, dizzying me with confusion.  This was my introduction to historical fiction, and what an introduction it was.  It was the first book in a lifelong obsession with the genre.  The way that Rutherford handles his subject, telling the story of a particular place over time, using characters that change but families that don't, is genius.  I have since read his others but Sarum will always be my favorite.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie as a kid and was very glad to be able to share it with my children, they loved it too :)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|. Short & simply WHY. This in no way played out in a cliche predictable manner as a 32 year old fan and reader of the previous two books (also a pretty seasoned bookstore that is a huge, huge fan of the same people Ms. Roth in blogging and such writings made her fan base aware of her OWN fandom--like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games. This is set in dystopia America, and yes indeed the United  States.) has I am not so sure in my mind why the word \\"ALLEGIANT\\" was thought to be a good title as I read the book. I looked up the precise definition because I had noticed the author like me has an affection for interesting wordy English words that make you seem really smart or snobbish (depending on your perspective)...and indeed admitted to an obsession with changing names in the teaser book to this when comparing a human transformation to a metaphorical name change. She is setting the stage for some deeply psychological METAPHORICAL situations.<br /><br />For me, I admit this book came at either the perfect point or the worst. I deeply hate this book but not because it was bad. I hate this book because I had been looking forward to it for months. When I read it I am haunted by this thick sadness that crawls back in to my waking moments. I try not be AS masochistic as was when I was younger. I literally begin to become a bit unhinged and haunted by the combo that IS Tris & Four.  As their personal struggles deepen I'm examining my own. Like Four I have the emotional damage from childhood. Like Tris, I'm processing grief of my mother who died just last month. My father in 2011. I'm still relatively young to have no PARENTS. In fact I'm the only person I know who ran out of grandparents @ age 17. I have seen a lot of death in my life. But nothing hurt me as acutely as losing my mom and dad between 2011-2013.  I am 32 & the only person on earth that cares whether I breathe or Don't is lying beside me asleep. I can't sleep. I'm \\"bipolar\\" you see. As good as genetically damaged!! The themes in ALLEGIANT are so close to my real life I'm visibly shaken because this book has reminded me of every single of biggest worries.  And so artfully that I wasn't fully aware the book was causing me to manner a lol more depressed today than usually.  Normally I can try to mentally & emotionally fight all my demons.  IT'S EXCEPTIONALLY HARD TO DO WHEN YOUR DISTRACTION, IS TRIGGERING EMOTIONALLY CHARGED EVENTS, QUESTIONS INTO YOUR ALL READY GRIEF STRICKEN MIND.  I have been keeping alive and my THE demons at bay. I don't know if someone close Ms. Roth died. However, she has experienced it. Only someone STRICKEN with grief could put this under current in her book. JK ROWLING said her books, the Potter series were about her getting over her mother's death. I may have to read them again after this horrific trail of trauma.  I SAY THAT BUT I MEAN IT A GOOD WAY, THE. EFFECT ON ME RIGHT NOW IS TERRIBLE. EVEN THE LAST WORDS OF THE BOOK HAVE NO IMPACT ON ME. I'm emotionally spent and I would take memory serum!  THEN there is a SOMEONE running his fingers through my hair. And the guilt that wells up inside of me at even the thought of memory serum. That is when I TRULY understand the title. The last scene. The last words. I know without a shadow of doubt had I done just one thing differently and NOT fallen in love with this wonderful man asleep beside me who just today told me I was the kindest hearted person he ever met & I ask incredulous of the truth that thought how it could be true, he is reassuring ME I am a worthy human being because this book not only has me going down memory lane....But I am questioning society. I'm looking @ the things that happened to my parents in sickness & death as this\\"system\\" capitalized and cannibalized my family down to me. I feel guilty for things doctors did or did not do.<br /><br />This was a really unpredictable book for me. I truly didn't expect this series to be so damned depressing. I read these books for hope. I have enoughrealism in my life.<br /><br />Like most readers I'm confused. I stayed away from all media after its release and just found out my reaction isn't an anomaly!!!  People are mad for buying this book. I thought this book was getting to my grief. Maybe I was getting to bored and my mind was wondering.  I did scroll right down through my kindle. I guess the editors knew this was sucked, the price went 11 something for PREBUYING ON KINDLE, TO 6.99, that should have sent me the big message.realism in my life.<br /><br />Like most readers I'm confused.

B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|The kids liked this game but we removed all the nonsense games and only download educational games now because they were too preoccupied with them.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not as scary as The Shining, but I liked it better. The Shining scared the hell out of me, this one only scared a tiny bit out of me!
B001EDYJJU|5.0|I enjoyed Syrians immensely. To be sure, it seemed a bit convoluted but the storyline really opened my eyes to the reality that everyone has a stake in the oil industry and that it is very cutthroat. The acting was good and quite intense. I initially saw it at a theatre and thought it a good time to revisit the issue by purchasing on DVD.
B00062PN6I|2.0|i read several reviews before i ordered. very surprised i didn't see more comments about how hard the ear pads were. maybe they will soften with time, but for now they are horrible. i didn't expect a whole lot for the price but they could have made something softer than these.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|If you enjoyed the first &#34;new&#34; Star Trek, you will almost certainly love this one. Cumberbatch does a great Kahn and bad guy.
1451638450|5.0|I am so glad that after all these years that Ms. Bujold has finally allowed Ivan to shine. Through all the years and the novels, he's gone from &#34;that idiot Ivan&#34; to one of my favorite supporting characters in sci-fi. We've seen bits and pieces of his wit and charm, couched in his own form of intelligence so unlike that of his cousin Miles, but this is the first time we've seen him &#34;go it alone&#34;, as it were. I also liked the more in-depth read into Byerly, the introduction of a fascinating set of in-laws, and the continuing humanization of both Alyce Vorpatril and Captain Illyan. Such a rich world should occasionally feature more than one protagonist, and having Miles on the back burner for a change doesn't hurt the series at all. Dare we hope for a future novel featuring Ms. Elli Quinn and the rest of the Dendarri? A meeting between Elli and Kat?<br />Miss Bujold has entertained me for more years than I can count with the Vorkosigan Saga novels and I am glad to see they are not becoming stale and repetitive like so many other series do, instead allowing her characters to grow and change and delight us in new and different ways.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Was easy to set up and worked exactly as described. I bought it more out of curiosity to explore it's capabilities.  So far I've only used it a couple of times.  Only time will tell if it was a worthwhile purchase for me.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I read this along with my child who was reading it for class. Originally I was reading a few chapters to stay in pace with her but then about 5 chapters in , I just read the rest because I wanted to know what happened next.  I enjoyed it.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Not as good as the first Iron Man but entertaining enough. As always Downey Jr. sells the movie more than anyone else.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Easy to use, nice interface, best basic calculator that I've seen so far. Not for students who need a complex calculator. Just right for me.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Jane Austen returns to parody in her send up of the contemporary Gothic novels. Fun and remarkably real in its portrayal of a young girl who finds everything she looks for.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Great album, every song is awesome, great production and sounds good! &#34;Walk On&#34;, and &#34;For The Turnstiles&#34; two awesome songs, Features the late great Ben Keith.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|This was a super fun movie to watch with the kids. Gotta love Nick Cage and it dealt pretty strongly with the family unit
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad I'm finally able to play Candy Crush Saga on my kindle.  C. C.S. is the best game ever. Once you start playing you cant stop.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This is what i was looking for. This was an excellwnt option to microsoft office. Thanks for hour hard work.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So glad I found this app. I set the timer and I'm asleep before the sound stops. Love it love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids liked this game but we removed all the nonsense games and only download educational games now because they were too preoccupied with them.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I always loved the show! Wouldn't miss it when it was on. Glad I can reminisce through Prime membership! Ingenuity and resourcefulness prevail in the series. We might solve a lot of the world's problems if we adopted some of those simple non violent techniques!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this game for so long, and it doesn't disappoint. There haven't been any technical issues-like I had on my other device. It's great!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Just what my grandson wanted. He loved it. Put it together before we even cut his cake. Leggos are ageless
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I feel like Will Smith is a much better actor than what he did here. I'd honestly say Jayden had a better performance. But, if you like sci-fi stuff this is definitely worth renting.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have never been so upset over the ending to a series in my entire life. I read a lot of YA novels and thoroughly enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent. I will never be able to reread those two books. The ending of Allegiant has put a stain on them. It would have been nice to be able to go back and start at the beginning, like I do with a lot of my books, knowing that it all the torture these characters go though is worth something in the end. It's not. Veronica Roth put us through the ringer with Tris and Four's relationship and she apparently didn't give a shit that we, the readers, had so much invested in them. My biggest problem is that Tris is a badass, she can survive the death serum and that is a truly triumphant moment in the book...and then Veronica Roth decided to kill her. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!?! WTF?!?!? Why even have her survive the death serum. YOU SUCK, Veronica Roth! I will never read another one of your books. And by the looks of all the reviews for this shitty excuse for a book, I am not the only one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Addicting. I thoroughly enjoying watching this show. It's refreshing to watch quality acting with witty dialogues - not cheapened by nudity and profanity.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|this game is fun. good for passing the time. challenging but not so hard that you get frustrated.overall good game.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie. Tom Cruise may be crazy in real life but always delivers as a great actor.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|\\"A Time to Kill\\" was one of my favorite Grisham novels. He brings back those characters three years later to a gripping case you think can`t be won. Love the characters and hopefully he will provide another installment.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Everything I hoped for in a sequel to The Shining. Really classic old school King. This book has everything that makes King a great scary story teller.
B001BANK32|4.0|Two thumbs up for The Shining.  Stephen King never fails to impress.  Where he comes up with this stuff is anyone's guess.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Watched it with my boys and we had a blast. Super fun to see these huge robots pummeling huge monsters.
B0048LPRD2|5.0|This is a psychedelic romp through the mind and soul.  I've never seen a film shot quite this way or with this concept.  I won't say anything to ruin it, but rest assured, you need to see this flick now!  The blu-ray is pretty decent, but not visually the best.  The audio is effective.  Buy it.
B00E0SX118|4.0|Our whole family loves this movie. It is definitely good for all ages. We have watched it many times already and just bought it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Grabs your interest and doesn't let go.  Stayed up all night and read the entire book.  Can't wait to read number two.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books in this series and could not wait to read Allegiant. I was disappointed with this book from the beginning to the end.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I thought it was intense and well acted, loved it & kept me on the edge of my seat. Great movie!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I started this book as a skeptic. I finished it having fallen in love with it. Excellent!! A great book!
0385344333|5.0|All Jack Reacher books are absolutely amazing and this one is no different. You don't have to read the series in any particular order but I recommend reading all of them anyways!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|First I need to say that if you have the patience you do not need to spend money to get more lives, on the other hand the game is so frustrating that you can't help but get worked up and want to keep playing! I am on level 30 and stuck. I have looked at cheats only to find I am doing everything I logically can to win the level. No lie, I played the level 15 times and never once saw more than 3 of the 6 ingredients needed to clear and win in the 60 moves it gives you. There is 99.99% luck to this game, and the rest is skill. This is why I believe people waste their money then complain about it. Fun and challenging to say the least.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game, my only con would be the commercials that pop up. They should all have the same spot to get rid of them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun but at times frustrating game. Great for days when you are stuck inside with nothing to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that this is now available for my kindle fire!  Graphics and responsiveness are great.  An improved version of what I play on my pc.  Beware!  Highly addictive!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 7 year daughter loves playing this app. She likes to train, feed, take pictures, etc. She can't stop playing it.
B008133MDK|4.0|Witty, clever, a little spicy and always a mystery. I really enjoyed watching this show.<br />Can hardly wait to see the next episode.
B000W178XO|4.0|A very comprehensive album, full of the Man in Black's best stuff. Just wish they had some more of the live recordings on here, especially Folsom Prison Blues. There is no excuse for having the studio version instead of the live version. Can't go wrong though for the price.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book as usual was better than the movie. Really enjoy the depth of character development and look forward to the next book.
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|bombed at the box office and destroyed by critics, but i was just what it was suppose to be.  Swords and sorcery with even at least one actor, Stephen Lang, who actually knows hoe to act!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I watched the Netflix adaptation before reading the book and really enjoyed it, and while the TV show starts out mostly like the book, it deviates a lot for dramatic purposes. The book is much more informative about the realities of being incarcerated in a women's minimum security facility. It's not a pleasant place to be and of course the system is rife with corruption. The story is fast paced but conveys how life there in prison anything but fast paced. I came away with a better understanding of the frustration, monotony, degradation and corruption that is prison life.
B000VRSTEQ|3.0|A fair number of hits are here, but it's still lacking some essential tracks. I bought it mostly because it was on sale. Certainly would never pay full price for this lackluster collection.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I don't know what to say about this that won't ruin your life.  I like my fantasy worlds to have happy endings.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Overall it's a good app. Nor the most accurate thing in the world, but it gives you a general idea as to how the weather is gonna be. I'd get it. Nothing to lose since its free.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Just as in the first book in this trilogy the author has cleverly woven his fictional world with the reality of war. The action of this story takes place in Vienna around the period of the first world war.<br /><br />Yet this is not the story you will be familiar with. Again, as in the first instalment, the author tells a story about the war with which the reader is not familiar.<br /><br />The characters are real and gain the empathy of the reader. Their surroundings and the trauma they live through is engaging and cleverly described.<br /><br />This is truly a magnificent, not to be missed read from a very talented writer.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game very much,the only thing is not enough time to play  we should get a ten opportunity to play not five
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|the story line kept me enthralled to the very end. Stephen King seems to have his mojo back with this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Keep me on my toes<br />I can't wait to read the next book<br />What a great book<br />You will love it
B00BVVA138|4.0|Not as good as some of their older material but still enough for me to justify a purchase. Keep it up.
B000VWSI8S|5.0|Just say Duke and Mr. Coltrane together is enough,but this is truly amazing.Duke's piano seems like it floats around the playing of Coltrane, making it almost dream like.Beautiful!
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Great Stuff. Great Mix Of Alter Bridge's classic sound. Didn't Think It Would Work That Will But Tremonti Taking A Larger Vocal Role Sounds Great.
1476727651|5.0|very good book couldn't put it down!!! I hope they make a movie of it, Stephen king did it again.DOCTER SLEEP
B003M70O5O|5.0|I never thought I'd love a show about motorcycle gangs, but I'm so impressed by the writing on this show. It's excellent and it makes you care about each and every character. Awesome!!
B000784WMW|5.0|I love the story of Jane Eyre, and have seen several different version.  This of course, is my favorite because I totally love to watch Timothy Dalton.
B0058W74UY|1.0|This software is useless on my tablet. There isn't much more to say. Flash videos dont work. Ok longer lalalalalalalalala.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Some great music on this double disc. Too bad there weren't about five more songs. They should have included the DVD part of the show
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this one. It keeps you guessing. It was a little bit difficult on some levels but that just makes it all the more rewarding when you beat it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive.  Once you start playing it is hard to stop.  The first ten or so levels are easy.  After that the levels get harder and harder and you can get stuck for days or weeks.  It is really fun though.  I have downloaded it on my kindle, pc and I-phone I like it so much.  It is really easy on the Kindle and I was thrilled when I saw it available for download on the Kindle Fire.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Wow, this was a complete and I mean complete waste of time and money to produce this! This movie had a weak plot, special effects, and acting. I am still trying to figure out how this race of people survive in spaceships made of paper??? LOL, and they fight advanced races of aliens with swords???? I didn't get it but, different strokes for different folks!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever so addictive and the new update my sister was crying with laughter when I scared the shot out of here with hdnsksksbdbdjxbdkdbxnxbxdbdksnsldndkddksns kdnsksnsksnsnssssssssssss
B0030DBGXY|1.0|I love cold steel, but for the price this knife has a horrible finish and is just plain awkward to use.  Some people seem to like it - brushed steel on a knife?!?!? To each their own, but I found it terrible looking.  I'm sure it is quite strong.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could feel everything that happened deep within my heart. This book was a piece of literary art, beautifully put together and wonderfully written. If there was a hall of fame for books, this one would defenently be there. *tears*
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|This is an excellent film to add a bit of romance to an evening, as it is a stellar film with a fun plot, a few twists, and tremendous acting.  Hits all the right points.
B000HF0J36|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and loved it. The sharks look super fierce and the storyline was good too. Loved the characters and the surprise with Sam Jackson was awesome!<br />If you are a fan of shark movies then I recommend you check this movie out.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|This app has quite a few games for the money and all, so far, are done well enough to be relevant to the purpose.
B004W648Y2|5.0|Arthur is certainly the Kinks finest album.The songs are generally longer with more twists and turns and punchier arrangements than on their earlier recordings.Perhaps, as Dave Davies noted, this is because they were afforded more time in the studio to embellish these songs.The stereo mix of the original album is fantastic, and is clearly preferable to the mono version, where distortion can be heard at various times.However, the mono bonus tracks are very nice indeed.The only real clunker here is Hold My Hand.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Not a bad time killer on the kindle<br />It could allow you to play a lil longer for free, but all in all a solid tablet game
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great Tom Clancy novel with all the elements expected in one of his works.  I'm going to miss this guy.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Fun for the first few levels but unable to go farther without paying for power ups. Levels are unbeatable after 23 or so. Always pushing for Facebook connect. Do not connect with Facebook as all of your friends will get spammed.
B00ET9T2WK|4.0|This is an AWESOME game. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because how slow it is to load on the Kindle. Other then that, all thumbs up. I strongly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I freaking love this game thank u for getting it for the kindle fire hd now I can play it all the time yay
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Supremely disappointed in the last book of this trilogy!  I tremendously enjoyed the first two books  in this series.....pre-ordered the third as soon as it was available....and regret reading it.  I know I am a person that prefers happy endings but this was a slap in the face to all readers of this series.  The writing was far below what I had come to expect after reading the first two. To have killed Tris or Four off was a story killer ....despicable!  Not sure I will ever read another book by this author.
B004M8S440|4.0|A beautifully written book with such realistic characters. However, I have my doubts about their happy ending. Venetia wasn't sure Damarel would be faithful to her but felt she could live with it, if he wasn't. I dont see how she could take such a betrayal so this attitude irritated me. Had she no pride for goodness sake? Talk about a doormat.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is like the best......I can't believe that I got this game<br />Nd never like this game but since  I played it it has been a good game
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Great season... as all Sons of Anarchy seasons...<br /><br />Loved to watch it again... and would watch it again and again...
B0089LOG02|5.0|Fantastic writing. Great story. The acknowledgements were as interesting as the book. This book should be an example of what good writing is all about. I couldn't put it down. This is a book I will remember. Powerful.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love these types of games glad I can finally play on my kindle and not just my computer. Thank you
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|awesome graphics its a blast to play cant get enough of it and its free too cant beat a deal like that
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game has good competition. I enjoy the different levels and the different things that I have to overcome. It is exciting to win a level. Some levels are very hard.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I gave it a five because it is very challenging. I am still learning how it works. I love hidden object games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Though there seem to be some features that are not available on the app like there is on the computer. Like choosing to start with 3 extra moves. It's addictive and fun. I find myself plYing as often as possible. I can't believe some people are on levels in the 400s!!!!
0446572764|4.0|As I was reading this book I could tell that the \\"history\\" was simplistic (read the review by Il'ja to see what I mean) and the plot was occasionally resolved a little too tidily, but I simply felt *compelled\\" to keep reading, and keep reading, this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Am so hooked and have trouble putting down. I have so much fun playing this game, on two computers.wishing it would go for ever.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I love the romance build up and to get to know each character in the story before the main issue blows in the story it made me connect with the story so much more! This is a great read! Well done!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|GREAT show. I am obsessed. Great writing and pacing and characters.  More Anerican shows need to be this well written!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good season but for the last 10 minutes. I did like Mathew dying.  Bad. The series will now take on a dark air.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have nearly completed this book and will be starting book 3, very shortly. I think this has been a great series, with a great store line.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Didn't like it, kept freezing up my kindle. Then it would always tell me the minion stopped running when i would use another app.
B009APMNB0|1.0|I returned the first ColorMunki because the software kept telling me to plug in the device, and it was plugged into my computer already. So I thought I just got a bad product. I returned it and ordered an exact replacement. The second product was just as bad as the first one - the softtware would not recognize that the calibrator was plugged into my laptop. I returned the second one, asked for a full refund, and ordered a Spyder4Express instead, which worked just fine.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.
B003UD7JEE|3.0|Make no doubt about it, Maggie Q is hot as Nikita. On the other hand Shane West is far too \\"pretty\\" for this role. His voice is annoying, not to mention the perfect hair, peach fuzz beard and \\"tough guy\\" squint. Also annoying is Amanda. How are we supposed to take her serious when she gives off the appearance of a hooker?<br /><br />The story lines are somewhat interesting. Overall the show is so-so.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|This is one of those horror/comedy movies that don't always work for me, but this one does. It's good clean fun!
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I cannot say enough good about Jeaniene Frost.  Her writing is fun, storytelling is thorough and engaging and her characters are lovable and addictive.  Her stories are nothing crazy or off the wall and the romance is not central to the story (which I like because the storyline is so compelling, I want to know what happens next!)  I love her style and love vampire stories so this is one I would highly recommend.  There is plenty of action, bad villains and great good guys.  It just hits on everything a decent book needs.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|Even in its original form The Elements of Style is a superb reference for writing clearly in English. The section on appropriate use of punctuation is enough to make your writing more understandable.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|If you want a good and true to life novel to read, try it. It's not the usual boy meets girl, ribbons and fluff type. It has depth and genuine emotions. The moment I started reading I couldn't put it down until I turned the last page.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Other reviewers have said it all: GREAT BOOK!  This one kept me up all night, and I had to go to a hospital appointment in the morning.  After mentioning being up all night several people in the hospital waiting room became involved in a discussion about this book. Be sure to mention this one to fellow readers!  It is a great conversation starter.
B00ATP24SW|3.0|Love the lyrics and the music but the singer can't seem to hit the high notes. He does good until he tries to go high and he sounds like he is in pain.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|While I loved most of the book, I was overwhelmed by the past, present, and future lifetimes all jumbled together.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|Stephen King is the best; I have read almost everything he has written, but this novel doesn't even seem to be his work.  Too much trash, drugs, drinking, etc.  I deleted it from my Kindle after a few chapters; didn't want to waste any more time.  Hope next novel is back to his brilliance.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|One Summer is a fun read about an amazing year in our history, told in the entertaining style of Bill Bryson.  If you like being entertained by images and stories within the story you will enjoy this book.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This story is powerful and story telling at its finest. She has made this book the end of an epic. It was an ending that shocked me and at first I didn't even like it but as I thought more about the characters and what their beliefs were it all fit perfectly together. If a few days go by and I am still thinking about the book then in my mind it is bloody brilliant.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|can't stop playing even when you get stuck on a level<br />good for all ages<br />colorful and quick moving - easy just frustrating
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I really enjoy zombie movies. I really liked this movie. It didn't have a long boring start. Started out exciting from beginning.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I've had repeated low memory problems with all that hidden file nonsense on my kindle fire - no longer! clean master is easy to use and helps enormously.  thank you!!!!!
B002XG1OUE|5.0|So, when I saw that you'd get a mini model of the NCC-1701 with this movie - I was thrilled.  When we received it and opened it up, we were over the moon.  Great set, arrived in perfect condition and, we think, a must for any ST fan out there (regardless if your a Trekker or Trekkie).  Just very, very cool.
140006922X|4.0|Assuming the research is true, this is a revealing story of the rise of the sect that grew to be Christianity.  Too much detail for the average unindoctrinated reader.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|(:happy:) Finally, it's on the kindle fire's. If only I could get an infinite amount of lives. #crushing #candy #candieshavingnightmares
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Hannibal was the biggest surprise of the 2013 Spring TV season. This taught thriller manages to combine serialized storytelling with a procedural murder-of-the-week format, all under Bryan Fuller's brilliant guidance. His unique voice, while enjoyable in Pushing Daisies and Dead Like Me, has finally found a place where it can just explode on the screen. The stylized violence is stomach turning not just because it's visceral, but because at some points, it's so beautiful you find yourself forgetting that Hannibal is evil. He perfectly captures both the lure of this serial killer as well as his depravity, and he elevates Thomas Harris's original material, even paying homage to the lesser Hannibal and Hannibal Rising throughout the season.<br />The extra features on the Blu-Ray are pretty standard, but informative. The show is so well-made, especially for a network production, that it's fun to see how they have brought this story to life. The gag reel is good fun, too, and lightens the mood of such an intense show.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the first one. I could never stop playing it. Then I saw the second game. If you like turns, human, several regions, and a few surprises then get ready for TEMPLE RUN 2!
B009V0TV6O|5.0|I do not know what all this free vs. full talk is all about.  In app settings on my gnote 2, this app is listed with &quot;free&quot; in the title, but i do indeed have the full version.  I spent 20 minutes being confused as to what i had because of all these reviewers that have the time for a full length bad review but no time for a simple note to the dev.  Learn how to use the app first, then review it!<br /><br />A big thank you to all the reviewers that did indeed take the time to give us usefull info!<br /><br />The app works nicely, i have the full version on first download.<br /><br />I really love the &quot;clock&quot; animation which helps me see exactly how the beats unfold!<br /><br />Stereo is nice touch, as well as making my own presets.<br /><br />Thanks for this nifty little tool!
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I missed most of last year so I needed to catch up. I am so glad that I got this because it made the first show even better. I would recommend to anyone who has not seen the show or for those of us that love it!!!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I love it so much hope more books come out so I can read more of this amazing series ,
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved the final installment of this series and having already heard Roth talk about what her intentions were with this book I felt everything made sense and it was a great story overall. Although it sucks to lose Tris it all was fitting with everything that Roth worked up to. If you are looking for some intellectual, dystopian masterpiece...read something else. This a YA series from a new author and considering that - she did a great job. Fun read.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Funny and heart warming. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found the author's style to b e intellectual yet down to earth. Five stars!
B00BMKH5NW|1.0|As a geek who happens to be female, I thought I'd really like this.  I really, really did not. It's about a girl who writes pseudo-Harry Potter fanfic. Eeyep. If that's your cup of tea, by all means, proceed. If you do, however, be ready to embrace your inner 14-year-old. Ellen Kushner this ain't.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I really use this app very often. It works great! I often use it at restaurants to figure out the tip too!
B008Y7J91M|5.0|It was very long.  I had watched before and I enjoyed it and I would advise anyone who likes a good love story to watch it.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|With over a thousand reviews, I am not likely to say anything new about &#34;World War Z&#34;, so let me compare it, favorably, to &#34;Pacific Rim&#34;, which I saw the night before I watched Brad Pitt and Co. &#34;Z&#34; is just inside the realm of possibility. There is no Zombie disease, but the notion of a pandemic is entirely too possible. That sliver of possibility makes all the unlikely occurrences easy to accept, once you go along with the basic premise. In contrast, the premise of &#34;Rim&#34; is pure Sci-Fi. Pure imagination. There have been several good speculative stories written about robot design which indicate that the best design for a killer robot would look much more like an Abrams M1A1 tank than like a Terminator. Even the underlying premise, of a dimensional portal between two tectonic plates is largely fantasy. Pandemics we can buy easily. Dimensional portals, not so much.<br /><br />&#34;Rim&#34; is lots of gorgeous eye candy. &#34;Z&#34; turns your bowels to water at more than one place. The story runs from hope to hope denied to more hope to more hope denied. I came close to turning it off at three places, but I stuck it out. There is only one improbability in the plot which annoyed me. In the real world, it would have been colossal bad luck. But why put it in a fiction. Well, for the very same reason. It is the first lift of hope, brought down almost to despair, and the film is hardly 1/4 over.<br /><br />The movie is a well-choreographed roller coaster, with an amazingly plausible solution at the end.<br /><br />It may be the kind of movie you do NOT want to watch alone, and maybe you do not want to watch on Halloween night.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Why should I use this when the you tube downloader if free and trouble free, as it was made for and by You Tube?
B007ZXK08C|5.0|It was a very good thriller. I couldn't put it down. Definite page turner and awesome ending. I really can't wait to reader other books by this author.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Love this game and for it to be on the kindle I was super excited. It is an addictive game.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Intense stuff. Americans will find this perhaps overly dark. Fluffy ending it is not,  it parallels Arrivederci Yamato in the resolution. However, if they were creative, I do see the possibility of a sequel. They could do it, I would hope that they would find some way to pull this off. Sheesh, if Optimus Prime can come back, so can Kodai and the Yamato.<br /><br />Really awesome movie. While I would have liked it to have the lighter aspect that the series had, I feel that theatrical nature, really captures the spirit that lives in the franchise.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire and it is extremely cute and works very well. I'm not sure what the other person meant by it being buggy because I haven't experienced it. Overall this app is great and fun for any age.
B00ENZUUF8|4.0|I have always considered Scorpions as one of the best ever and this album is a very good one. I currently own a couple of Scorpions later dvd releases but don't have video of the classic line-up that is on disc 2 of this Deluxe Edition. What I am needing to know is  what region this dvd is for and if it is NTSC or PAL format. Usually Amazon lists this info., but not for this item. I have searched everywhere and can't find it, so any info. will be greatly appreciated. Please rate the audio and video quality of dvd also if you can.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|The plotting, the characters, and the prose are all vintage Steven King. I was on the \\"edge of my seat\\" for most of the novel and really became emotionally invested in Jake/George and Sadie.<br /><br />That said, I found the plot too complex and the pace too slow at times, just as I did in \\"It.\\"  Maybe I have attention deficit, but I think this novel should have been a trilogy or condensed to 350-400 pages.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I tried...and tried...and tried to keep on reading this book hoping it would draw me in; however, the writing style left me confused and bored.  I saw that it got high ratings from others so that is what motivated me to keep sticking with it.  I eventually deleted it from my Kindle and moved on.  I'm happy to say that the next book I began reading drew me right in.  I'm so glad I put this one down and moved on.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I am very satisfied with this app. The calculator is a great size and easy to use. I like that it keeps the last entry showing incase I second guess myself.
B009V0TV6O|3.0|This app is already free in the playstore. Can't be too picky for faotd. Even when you instal,  the title says free. It does serve its purpose.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun &amp; addictive.  I love to play to unwind,  kill time,  or just try to out-do my friends.
1401225756|5.0|I ordered this out of curiosity and do not regret a thing. if you like darker tales, i highly recommend this.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|I wrote the developers, they said that this is the full version, They just made a mistake with the name of the app, and that it will be corrected very soon.<br /><br />It's sad that people are damning this great and original metronome just for this. Well, think about it, if it has no ads, no internet permission, no limitations, no advertising of a paid version, and in addition, it's fantastic. Why would this be the free version?<br /><br />Overall 5 stars. I see myself practicing every day with this!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|The game is a visual novel puzzle game. It has a very piquant story and multiple endings. It's not really clear how to get some of the good endings, but you can always look that up online.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Wonderful array of individuals.  Beautiful people in an cityscape.  The photographs are touching, funny, cute, adorable, sad, hopeful, determined, beautiful, meaningful and everything in between.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in photography, people and/or NY.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Addicting. Play when I get a few minutes during the day. Great game for kids. Problem solving for them
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I just finished reading Marked written by P.C. And Kristin Cast. It's the first book in the House Of Nights series. It takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It's about a girl who gets marked to become a vampyre. After being marked, she goes to a private vampyre school. She meets new friends and discovers she's gifted with a great gift. She also struggles to adapt to the changes and fit in.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed this book very much. This is not my first time reading it, and it probably wont be my last. There are many people who automatically think it's just some stupid book because they compare it to other books and don't really give it a chance. It's a very bizarre twist on vampirism, but it's a good twist. This is one of my favorite all time series!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it just changed me so much. I love all the books but this one just seemed the most beautiful. IT WAS REAL AND HONEST!<br />Veronica Roth wrote the ending beautifully. At first everyone is angry with the choice she made but when you finish crying your heart out you see that from the first page of Divergent that Tris would always make the decision she did! During Insurgent Tris swore that she wasn't selfless and that she was messed up but Four saw that she was doing little acts of selflessness that Tris never noticed and I think that, at the end, her decision was the most selfless of them all and even though she choose Dauntless during the choosing ceremony, Tris shows us all what DIVERGENT really means!<br />The whole book was a big roller coaster that your heart goes on constantly! This book is amazing and just shows you that life goes on even when you aren't ready to, life doesn't just stop for you, even when you feel like your life is ending. Lastly, this book teaches you that even if you feel like living is too much to handle, when you are going through grief, you still have to continue on because death/losing your memory is a one way street and once you go down it there's no second chances and no turning back <3
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game like forever Ioved playing on my iPhone but I would enjoy it more if it was on my kindle fire an  now it is
B008602KQI|4.0|Enjoyed the movie greatly. The picture and sound quality were quite good.  Looking forward to the sequel sometime this year!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Have always loved this movie. Shake shake shake senora shake your body senor shake shake shake your body In time  ok.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent wind-up for the trilogy - Makes me wish for more. - to hell with you and your review requirements
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book with a passion. The adventures the twist and turns and the passion but the ending why! I cried over and over and my heart is literally in two!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was very original.  Liane Moriarty did a good job of writing 3 stories that all came together.  The point of the book is that all of our lives could have all been so different had we chosen to do one small thing differently....and we never would have known.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is another good novel.  I was aware of the story of orphans and am aware<br />of the lives of the young children.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Now you see me the movie this was really good it had so mean twists and you really couldn't figure out what was going on into the very end I won't tell you what happened by I love the ending so to give this a rating I would have to give it of five stars 4 1/2 stars and I will beginning that this one to.
B004J09ONG|5.0|too good  all must see  the cats are so pretty  the wild world is great  every thing about this film is a must to see
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book starts out a little slow, but picks up and becomes difficult to put down. Not entirely happy with the ending, but still a good read to get there.
B00632HWOG|1.0|The new Yahoo version is horrible!!!!!!!! It's the worst ever!!! Plus there's more spam.  Want the old one back!!!!! Please!!!!!!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|After Earth the movie it was okay on a part in their I really liked was the very end I won't tell you about it but will Smith didn't do hardly anything in this movie it was mostly his son and this movie I think a dog would act better and he did I me I am not downgrading his acting talent but in certain movies if it's the same one who played in Karate kid I loved the Karate kid he was really good in that movie I think it's better in the first three or four of these movies the originals but in this part he wasn't just right for a mean that's it I mean if I find is movie cheap enough yell I'll buy it but for the price they are asking for no way I wouldn't pay for so five stars I would have to give this three and half stars just because the movie didn't come together I me it could not been the actor at all the could of been the people who made the movie the director or the script writer it just never took off it just limped along.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|saw my older brother play it and I myself love mtg so decided to get it w/out reading comments<br /><br />BIG MISTAKE<br /><br />had to reset my kindle<br />thank you to the makers of mtg, for forcing me to embark on the journey of, not a planeswalker, but one of reinstalling my apps.<br />from,<br />A very upset mfg fan
B00BD99JMW|4.0|See i read the other comments and they are bagging on it because of the bad ending. It is NOT a &#34;bad ending&#34; it is sad, but very well written ending. The serum parts can be a little confusing but i feel it is fascinating! I also heard it having a lot of climaxes.. But in this book, it keeps it interesting. Honestly im commenting because people gave it bad reviews because of the sad ending, well get over it, its a great end book and i suggest that you read it.
B000683VI4|5.0|I got this really quick and the movie played great. They did a really good job. I recommend them to everyone
B001GQ2BNQ|3.0|Didn't really like swimming with this as it seemed very uncomfortable to me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and don't use it.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|LIKED but took forever to download !!!!!!! It's a great way to learn but it took forever to download ... but I did like the game .
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The best game of the world and its also has great relics straight from the second bloodiest war,aka WORLD WAR 2 the best war in American history.
B007BVOEPI|1.0|i hate this series because it has absolutly no moral standards.<br />be aware that when watching this you will see inappropriate images that you wish you had not seen.
0226264211|5.0|I lived through his era, but did not know anything of him other than who he was. This is now giving me a retrospective understading of a major man in this country.
1891252089|5.0|Amazing book, so glad I got it.  Has great info and many poses if u can't do the full advanced poses yet.  Should be a lifelong companion book
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use facebook nearly all the time now, it's so much easier than using e-mail. I can keep in touch with everyone I know, nearly instantly.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Why does this book have such a sad ending to an amazing story?  Too much emotion and heartache for me.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Not the best written book I have read by far, but the story has a way to pull you back in every time that it makes for a very entertaining book. Highly recommended though it shows it's age from a science-fiction viewpoint.
140525355X|5.0|Great box set at a great price. My 3 year old grandson loves these books after his visit to the UK this summer.
1476727651|5.0|Thourghly enjoyed this book.  The continuation from the Shining was remarkable.  I will never look at RVs in the same way.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|I've never seen a good series collapse on itself like this. It was like watching a tragedy- the tragedy being the decline of this TV show. Season 7 gave us hope for a stellar ending, but what the writers ultimately did ruined not just this season, but invalidated any love I had for the series as a whole. I used to recommend the series wholeheartedly to anyone I could, and now I'm honestly kind of embarrassed to admit that I watched it. For a better written, more intellectually stimulating experience, I would point you to TMZ and Honey Boo Boo.
0920668364|5.0|I got this as a present for my nephew, and he's still a bit young to really get it but I know his mom will really love it and so will he!
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Tender, sweet and thoughtfully written.  Colors in a life of love, hope and support, and what happens when tragedy threatens all of that.
0753827662|5.0|This book started a little slow for me and quickly picked up pace and plot until I could hardly put it down!  Emotions get totally turned upside down as you become involved with each character.  Great read!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very addicting it takes a long time to get lives but other than that it a really fun game
B007SGM084|4.0|loved the story line but it was real nasty stuff but I guess it worked for them. they really loved each other
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|lt takes some understanding to get the most out of the game.  must learn special &quot;explosive&quot; moves.  i quit  on my iPad @ 125 after a month on that  one.  Happy to find it in my Kindle app store and have done 70 levels in one week.  hope too get to 125 again...and beyond.  Developer deserves a purchase once in a while.. i use points with Kindle to move on to special levels.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍one of tbe best movies yes great lived the Animation is really great to be able to see the way they mixed animation with live action
B0012QRPU4|5.0|After hearing all the hoopla about Breaking Bad, we just had to see it. You can't stop after Season 1. THIS SHOW IS AWESOME!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|De Ted is such a likable serial killer that you almost want him to get away with it!  Watch it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Thank you for finally adding thos to Amazon so it can be played on my Kindle.<br />Everyone in my family plays!
B000RLH2VM|3.0|I never had heard of this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Lots of car chases and blow 'em up effects. I thought it was a good movie to watch after trying to find something I have not seen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun as you move through a story board. Started one week ago and got to level 68.  Line up gaming friends in advance.  You need them to get through for extra lives and 3 for each train ride for free play.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This is the kind of video that get's shelved in an archive and only comes out around Halloween or a movie fest. It is a classic in that the actors and characters actually have the disabilities portrayed unlike today's use of movie tricks and makeup. All of the parts big and small show that we are all equal and capable in our own ways. Not to mention it's just a plain good flick.
0307352153|5.0|This is a terrific book for introverts and extroverts. It really helps in understanding strong personalities of either direction. I will loan it to my brilliant introverted daughter when I'm finished, but will ask for it back. Nice test in there for understanding your own personality.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like the three varieties. One minute, five minute and puzzle mode.  I try beating my best times to keep it interresting.  Perhaps you could add some different shapes instead of just cubes?  It would be very interresting that way.
B00005O438|4.0|The type of thing happen from the start of it was about a attracted from when dog put it nose in to a holes got bitter and it start to turn bad and attracted a friend of the family and kill him and kill the father I do not want to say to much to upset the story.<br />it is a real good movies about a dog lost control after being bitter by a batts
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is fun, but some levels can be maddening.  Don't let that keep you from playing, though. Glad it's available for my kindle fire now!
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Amazing movie, it arrived on time. I'm going to watch it a million times.<br />I have to warn you is like watching a drama so no mystery or action
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome! Been waiting a long time for this! Only wish I could minimize it so I don't lose a life.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I loved it...loved it as a child...even better as an adult!  It combines global history, musical theater and music theory into a greatly entertaining event.
B00DM0UTPQ|5.0|This movie was really good.I got used to watching David in the X Files and had a huge crush on &#34;Mulder&#34; but he played this part just as good.
B008Y212PI|4.0|A really enjoyable way to pass the time, it can get quite addictive though! I found the easier levels a bit too easy, but ad this was the first FlipPix game I had played I found it to be a good introduction. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys logic puzzles and wants to pass the time
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I've never watched the movie as of yet, but this game is very entertaining and fun to play while I'm waiting for something to download or out an about.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Everything went perfectly.  Product was as advertised, arrived quickly, good communication (answered email quickly).  All is well, will buy again.  Thanks!
B00FVAEKJ6|4.0|I think anyone who plays FlipPix Art will enjoy playing this. Need to get a littler harder in the next ones.
B001E7OO2I|3.0|There are a couple John Legend songs on this CD I found worth playing - \\"Ready To Go\\" an upbeat but difficult to dance to party grind and another I can't name but think is track 7 (or 8). Other than those two tracks this CD is somewhat less than exciting to the point of being uninspired. John really is a very accomplished musician and producer with a sophisticated ear for contemporary composition and arrangement but . . . \\"Evolver\\" does not really begin to showcase John's talent - and for me that meant alot of track skipping to find something worth listening to that wasn't preachy, whimsical or boring. I found this CD much less than memorable and once it's replaced in \\"rotation\\" in the CD player it probably won't be played again.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Everything went perfectly.  Product was as advertised, arrived quickly, good communication (answered email quickly).  All is well, will buy again.  Thanks!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book kept me up at night reading until I could no longer hold my eyes open. King at his best!
B00795P4EG|5.0|Cool app, does what it claims. Read instructions then away you go. It didn't crash, stall or anything like it. I like that you can rename your photos. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It took long enough to get to the kindle store. The program works well. Now all I need is papa pear and the farm saga. Very addictive game.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Leaving all poor reviews behind, I decided to \\"read it for myself.\\"  The Divergent series, as a whole, was a great set of stories.  When broken down can one really expect the third to be as stunning as the first?  I don't think so; this rang true in Allegiant.  Forget the ending...it was almost predictable.  With the number of times that Tris put herself in a dangerous situation, how she was lauded as a hero, this was easy to pick up.  My issue is more in the breakdown of a character's personality either from not being genetically acceptable or going against better judgement.  Characters being alive that were thought to be dead?  The death of these characters being the catalyst for change?  It's unfortunate...many were waiting in anticipation.  I was one, and am disappointed in the outcome.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My girls and I have a great time making our reef together great way to past the time and make my girls smile!!!!
B0084LQHN6|5.0|This is my favorite project of 2012 and a must buy. It reminds me of 90s house/dance music and I hope her upcoming LP sounds just as good. She also has a mixtape called 'Fantasia' which is pretty good too.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Gameloft has another installment in its GTA clone but that does not make it bad because rockstar games chooses to ignore kindles and nexuses. The game has its flaws. Voice acting is bad but not horrid. The price is a little high but it is fun but buy gangstar Vegas it is much better.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This was a good book no matter what people say. I didn't like some of the plot lines and I had a weird sense of deja vu sometimes. You have to remember though this is just what I thought. I say try the book your self.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game. The typical day and night at Sinai Grace is afraid to ask questions about Drew the most popular articles latest articles escape,half of the book was written by admin panel discussion.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This 4th installment in the Gangstar series is amazing. voice acting is better map is bigger game is overall better than gangstar Rio. Don't call it a GTA rip off because Rockstar Game chooses to ignore kindles and nexess. The price is worth it and the story is fine and entertaining. Live on Gangstar!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is so amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better conclusion to the trilogy. I am so amazed at the complexity of the story and how well it ended. I sobbed and smiled, laughed, and felt my stomach drop to my feet. Well done Veronica Roth.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Loved this book gave it five stars!! I really hope you guys how read it will love it like i did
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm in love candy crush saga is amazing I don't notice any difference between this and the iphone version super addicting love it
B008Y212PI|4.0|IT'S A GREAT WAY TO EXERCISE YOUR BRAIN.  EASY TO LEARN AND FUN TO PLAY. YOU WILL LOOSE TRACK OF TIME.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you amazon for finally getting this game for kindle fire. I've been waiting and waiting to be able to play it on mine.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Yay fun with ponies. The game is simple but engaging hours of fun. Also all our favorite ponies are here.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|This was added to my phone a few months back and really assisted with our travel.  The unfortunate part is at times it will not pick up a signal.  This happened to us twice in difficult situations.  We had to shut it down and wait several minutes (and time spent) retrieving the signal.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Cried for @ least one hour after the end of the book but you really need to get it right now thank you Veronica Roth great job with the divergent triology.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very addicting.  It runs it course before allowing one to win or suddenly one wins with no reasoning behind the moves.  Enjoy it!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I honestly LOVED all the divergent books. But it's hard to give 5 stars to a sad ending. I realize fairy tale endings are sometimes a bore but when you've grown to love the characters you don't expect them to be torn away from you in the end. Would have been 5 stars if there was an alternate ending where she lives. Take heed movie makers! Listen to the fans of this trilogy!
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I love this app, haven't had any issues.  I'm a weather freak so its perfect for me to know what the weather is on a daily basis without having to constantly check.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My HD Kindle is working great. I had my Kindle since December 2012. This is a awesome gift. Love it
B003W77SA8|5.0|This is an excellent CD by the Electric Light Orchestra. It has great music, great instruments, and great melodies. I highly recommend for old and new fans alike!
B0058W74UY|1.0|This is a big waste of time. The app does not work on Kindle. Don't even bother with the download.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|This is an excellent CD by the Electric Light Orchestra. It has great music, melodies, and rhythm. I would highly recommend for old and new fans alike!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Seems to have fixed my issue with my car cord that I ordered. And they want me to write more.
B000002URV|5.0|This was the first CD that catapulted Enigma into the limelight. It is a terrific first CD. I highly recommend it for old and new fans! Enjoy!!
B00BEIYMTW|1.0|I took my children all six and under to see this film. Within ten minutes Planes lost the attention of nearly every child in the very packed theatre including all of mine. Very heavy on dialogue withvery little action. This slow moving movie also lacks originality with many scenes ripped off from Cars. In Cars you cared about the characters, in Planes you don't. Originally Disney had planned to release this as a straight to Dvd movie. They should have stuck with their original plans.
B000002GBB|5.0|This is an excellent Styx CD. Some great sounds, melodies, and music. I would highly recommend it for old and new fans! Enjoy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Always with me!!!! Great reference great search for my many questions. Do not know how they provide this free. Sign up today
B000056VIY|5.0|This is an excellent CD with some nice dance music and ballads from Jennifer Lopez. I highly recommend it for old and new fans alike! Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is one of only a few games I play, I have enjoyed it most of the time,some levels seem a little unrealistic,I have been stuck for a month on my present level,I may just give up.
140053271X|5.0|I have a Nook Tablet already, but I wanted another that would hold the charge for weeks.  I need that on my travels.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|Purchased for my granddaughter, she picked it out. She did not like it. She likes to play doctor, this did not interest her at all.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I cannot believe how much this series has went from the great book of Divergent to the so so book of Insurgent, to this crap. Poorly written in my opinion.
B009YQJ322|5.0|One of the greatest action movies ever.  I love how they turned the limitation of a smaller budget into a really effective aesthetic and the performances, camera work, score and direction are all top notch!
B004YXE438|5.0|AWESOME!Get this app!!You will have so much fun with this app.  It is a great time breaker!Worth the money. You will not regret it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|free and my little pony. cant complain . gives you little challenges. to complete along the way like building things or unlocking ponies
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!! So glad it finally became available on my Kindle Fire HD an it's great that you can connect to Facebook so that you don't have to begin with level 1 all over again!!!!
B00005N7Z1|5.0|came factory sealed has no scratches clean dvd no issues watching the movie no complaints everything was good money well spent
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My little sister has mitochondrial disease and in many ways i live Via's life. this book is awesome. Its a helpful way to understanding the special needsand autism.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is actually addicting, they don't lie. I wasn't expecting g it to be but it is. It is very fun to play and entertaining.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game but I completed all of the trophy hunts for the first three regions and the fourth region hasn't appeared.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|What I like about this product is how when you store the camera you can turn the hood backwards and itll slide on looking like its not even there. I definitely recommend this to anyone that has this lens size!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|After a hard day at work and even little breaks in between, this game is addictive! Some levels take many tries-I think luck more than skill at times and then skill more than luck at times.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|The plastic cover was broken and the CDs will not stay in. This was not noticed until taken out of the box set. I gave this as a gift and felt horrible after they opened it. The box was not messed up but the plastic was so this had to be done before it was shipped. I will not order from this company again
B004VYYA2K|5.0|One of the best toys I've ever given anyone!. It's very useful and it teaches kids the most important part of picking up their messes,. I really enjoyed everything about this toy.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I think you guys should probably take off the energy that way I would rather give it a five star rating.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The main reason I have decided to give this movie three stars is due to the fact that the entire movie felt rushed. Every scene seemed to go by unusually quick and sometimes would leave you thinking &#34;wtf just happened?&#34; Another major complaint I have is that every event was too predictable. Even if someone has never heard of the series or read the books, it would still be fairly easy for them to predict what was going to happen next. The story was by no means bad but the whole movie really could have been better executed.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This was the most entertaining book I've ever read. Felt like I was really there in that age , with kings and Queens ,the fights and turmoil of the time.
1576875776|5.0|The photos are generally full page, very clear, and are of the quality that could be framed. The mystery that was Vivian Maier adds to its overall affect.  I have both books, this one and Vivian Maier: Out of the Shadows, and I'd highly recommend both.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for Amazon to offer Candy Crush in the app store. Now that I have it, I can't stop playing!
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|A wonderful reunion with an old friend.  More meaningful than I anticipated; I ended the book in tears of joy.  Thank you to Helen Fielding for updating Bridget' s story.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I love the tudors and it just gets better and better through the seasons! I have watched the entire series twice now and i will watch it again!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|As usual, the author has demonstrated his uncanny ability to make us look at different topics that seem to be disparate but often are not. If you enjoy considering unexpected insights I should think you would enjoy his latest book
1401938906|2.0|A good start in the first few chapters but focuses on religion too much later on. It had potential. There is only one or two exercises that could be affective.
006202406X|4.0|One of the things I am always wary of is finishing a series as I wonder do I really want to finish it as will I be disappointed with the results or will I be happy with the way it concludes ? What amazes me though with the power of the internet is how people can go about their daily lives and bash authors in the process about their books because something didn't set right with them. Allegiant was one of those books that was bashed , so I made a point of not reading any reviews about it and from the first page, I was hooked and could not put it down. I did find about halfway through the novel - it got a tad slow for my liking but of course I persevered and OMG the last few chapters came and I had tears in my eyes and was like NOOOOOOOOOO - how could Veronica do that to us poor readers :) This was a tissue moment. As a reader, something I am not too keen on is the alternate POVs in chapters - one off/ one on. In Allegiant , Veronica Roth has taken a leaf out of Marie Lu's and Rachel Caine's books and written Allegiant in both Tobias aka Four and Beatrice aka Tris's POVs. In this instance though, I congratulate the author as she has done it perfectly and the story flowed beautifully. You will note thy readers, that in this review I am trying to skate past what the book was about as I do not want to spoil it for you, so I shall leave it with these parting words - if you wish to see how the series concludes, then what are you waiting for - get off your seats and grab a copy of Allegiant as readers it will be worth it as you turn that final page<br /><br />#This was an ARC from Harper Collins.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easy to use, works every time I use it, and returns relevant results.What else would you want in a search app?
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This is a well written novel that gives the reader a different perspective into life in Afghanistan. I would recommend it to mature reader and on to preteen or teen readers considering some, of the details written in this book.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I love how she put herself out there with her story. Found it helpful as there are so few women in leadership roles. I also love the practical --but short-- advice on topics such as negotiating and mentoring.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|Installed on three different tabs and two smartphones...best on ''Vis-lnd''tab &amp; Samsung phone's but still pretty cool on the rest<br /> Unlike ''Leos' rc'' ( on G-play ) this one offers a plane,a heli,and a boat ...which may sound pretty lame but is actually a satisfying challenge.<br /> Not a memory hog either and with low permissions.<br /> Does tend to run in background ,so you should force close from apps when done...but that's my only complaint
B001NLKT60|5.0|Fast paced and takes you along for another ride with the incredible Lisbeth Salander. You will not be able to put it down.
B00F8LPH90|1.0|Play this game all the time on my iPhone, so I was looking forward to playing it on my KINDLE. Unfortunately, I have yet to play because it crashes as soon as I hit start.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS AWESOME I LOVE IT! It is the best game I have ever played!  Please do another update with redstone and pistines.I give this game a 5 star rating!<br />I am definetly going to buy the computer vershon.
B00BATKPBE|3.0|Richard Dawkins had many experiences growing up. He explains it all with much detail.  I found it to drag on and on though.  I seemed to lose interest after a while of reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Amazon finally got this game. It is so addicting. I just wish you could play on and on and not have to wait for the next play after you use up your games.
B00FN8HS5O|4.0|Excellent soundtrack. At times it's ethereal, bringing about images of nebulae and stars. Other times is down right manic, causing anxiety and a feeling of foreboding. I highly recommend this soundtrack. Try listening to it while playing space themed video games or star gazing. It's an amazing experience.
B00CM4VC7M|4.0|I was pretty excited this week when I got my shipping confirmation for Bandai’s new Sailor Moon figure.  I’ve been waiting twenty years for decent toys from this franchise.  I honestly thought the franchise was never going to get an action figure treatment.  But when Toei Animation announced a new series was going to start in winter 2013, Bandai saw their chance to make a few bucks off of the older fans.<br />Check out a full review here. [...]
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I love Cher since she and Sonny were on Ed Sullivan a long time ago.  Remember the first time they were on the show and she needed dental work.  Amazingly, that had to be one of the first things she had done after that time.  I have always loved her.  It seems she can do no wrong.  Love her acting, singing, and just about anything she does.<br />Did see her on Letterman last night and was not thrilled with her outfit.  Has to be the first time.
B00607EWYC|2.0|I will confess at the outset that I usually read lighter fare than Pulitzer prize winners, but I do enjoy the occasional foray into better literature. This book was the exception. I couldn't wait until I got to the end and could put it down permanently.<br /><br />I loved the stories about the 3 generations of men and how the author moved between their stories and made you think about what shaped them into the men they became. Unfortunately, there was a lot of other junk in the book which, I suppose, was supposed to encourage the reader reflect on life. By the time I was 2/3 into the book, I started skipping the \\"filler\\". A reader can only handle so much \\"reflection\\"; a novel requires a story that keeps you engaged.<br /><br />This book has so much potential, but it falls short by being overwritten.
B000083E79|4.0|Her oldies are truly goodies. Cher is a very versatile artist and her popularity will not wane. Many of my favorite numbers were included in this album, but many were not. There were some songs that I didn't care for at all...they were never chart busters when first released. All in all I would still recommend this album for the sheer nostalgia.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|We used to &quot;strongly&quot; encourage piano practice with our son Maxx....then we found Marcy, a teacher that, somehow, showed him the beauty of music and now he practices without a word from us... I already know this app is going to allow exploration of rhythm and his next stage of development ....composition !!!  If he wants, of course, thanks for this tool to beauty.  Maxx's Dads. (Lawson di Ransom Canyon)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I decided to read the books after I watched the movie. I usually read the books first watch the movie later but after watching the movie I knew I had to read the books. I was right, once you start reading them, you can't stop. Enjoy!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Very good movie with great action,I would have to say it the best iron man movie yet.i hope the will be a iron man 4,that would be cool.
B0000C1733|4.0|If you are a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, you have to buy this C.D. This has all of their classic songs and is just an all around great C.D. I have no complaints.
B009FA98JU|5.0|It's an apple mini display port to DVI adapter. It is a genuine apple product and it works as intended. I'm not sure what else you can say about a dvi adapter.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|I am a fan of Cross me, but this game has more variety. Would like it better if row and column numbers were crossed off when used.
B003G4W49C|5.0|After reading Ender's Game, I felt changed. Orson Scott Card forces you to feel everything Ender feels as he progresses through the games. I felt tragic... this book is amazing. I have nothing else to add.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you!! to whomever allowed this app for the KindleFire!! When I first got my device I was excited to think I could play this game only to be disapointed that it was not available. This was a wise decision to share this game and I think everyone should; Apple,Google,whatever. Customers want fun things, not a hassle when these companies fight for our business. I cannot afford an ipad or an iphone but my Kindle was a gift and I'm gratefule every day for it.
B00ET9T2WK|4.0|Very cool game but the population limits from level to level are ridiculously low!!! I think the creators are trying to get the players to buy($) a lot of nanopods so you can level up quickly. If you don't mind that definitely buy the game.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Many levels and different things to do. It kept me busy for several hours. I got my money's worth of entertainment.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|!!SPOILERS!!<br /><br /> I completely disagree with the one star reviews, this book was AMAZING!! The beginning went by a bit slower for me but didn't stop me from putting the book down! It was also SO emotional I cried many times especially at the end!<br /><br />The ending and that people are very unhappy about it... well most stories end so happy and cheerful, and well maybe I'm just happy this wasn't like EVERY other story Ive read. I personally think Roth ended it very well. I like how she changed it up.<br /><br /> It made me cry which, to me, is the best sign that it is a good book ;)
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|Great read!  Lost in some of the terminology but read on!<br />Unimaginable life experience.  I applaud both of you & look forward to the next read with great enthusiasm.  Recommend to all adventurous persons.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is awesome you can shoot the animals lung heart head and you can change your guns to better or worse if you can afford to buy them this game is my favorite game ever
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This was my third read of the book (I have also listened to the audio book several times) and I laughed until I cried just like the first time I read it. I could hear the voice of my Irish grandfather who had the curse of the Irish and the voice of my dear grandmother as she lived with his curse. I remember my own first Communion and the fear of allowing my 7 year old's teeth to come in contact with God.<br /><br />I'll be reading it again!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|One of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. Do not waste your hard earned money on this. Initial thoughts were 85%no good/ 15% o.k. After a couple of days and upon further thought I came to the conclusion that 15% was way to generous. Sci-Fi fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|masterpiece...kept me reading..never lost interest..great follow up...makes you believe your in the action...involved with the characters..well written..page turner..the best in the trilogy...must read and reread...five star all the way...epic...
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|This box set is very complete and interesting to look at. Everything was in good condition except for the music box. A corner was broken. But everything else is satisfying
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Simply Excellent! He has a way of presenting ideas and concepts for positive thinking that I've heard before, but have not understood until I read this book.
B0026ICMLO|5.0|Snow white is he first Disney movie I have ever watched and Snow White is my favorite princess. This box set is awesome!
B00D9PUXQY|3.0|The new album is pretty good, not great though. I won't go through trying to give my opinion of each track. As for the DVD, I mainly bought this set for the concert footage. I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD, except I am disappointed that track 6 basically doesn't exist. I Could Care Less isn't played at all on this. There are only 8 songs, not 9. I'm pretty sure it isn't a defective DVD, because clips on the internet show the same thing. Still, I would recommend this set for the DVD.
B00CTNUMPO|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out on Blu-ray! I love everything about it. It is a true masterpiece.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I remember watching this movie many, many years ago. I loved it, and bought it for my two year old daughter in the hopes she would love it too. The story is fun and somewhat easy for her to follow. She doesn't understand everything about it yet, but she got the gist fairly quickly. The concept of a mermaid princess is interesting to her, since the other princesses she adores are land lubbers. Ariel, the mermaid, is her favorite character in this movie, but she was enthralled with Sebastian, the crab ordered by King Triton (ariel's dad) to watch over Ariel, and Flounder, who is Ariel's best friend. Ariel is intrigued by what goes on above water, and longs to be human. Ursula, a sea witch, tricks Ariel into becoming human after Ariel falls in love with a prince she saved when his ship wrecked. This movie is filled with great scenes, great characters, and great music! It's a wonderful animated film and is suitable for all ages. Disney hit another one out of the park!
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|it was ok, but thought there would be more of him playing & there wasnt. but all in all was an ok movie
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Great quality DVD, and seriously, who doesn't love this movie? My husband and I bought this for our daughter and she was riveted. The characters are great, and the plot is much better than most of the &#34;classic&#34; kids movies my daughter has recently seen. I've watched this movie many times and it never gets old. Albert Brooks, Marlin,  plays a great neurotic dad, and Ellen DeGeneres makes her character, Dory, lovable and hilarious. The storyline is easy to follow, and makes finding Nemo a true adventure. There are a lot of interesting fish Marlin and Dory meet as they look for Nemo. They come upon sea turtles, sharks, jellyfish, and more, on their travels. This movie is visibly entertaining for kids, and has a nice amount of humor to keep the adult's attention as well. It offers a great message to help prepare parents for the day they have to start letting their kids do (or at least try) things on their own. Great family movie!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Amazing, captivating, and informative. Elizabeth Gilbert did it again!  Her research of historical events is evident in this compelling novel.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I thought Avatar was a very good movie when I first watched it in 2D, but I was blown away by the movie in 3D!!
B00D9PUX5A|5.0|Listen to it many times now and it has yet to get old and the remake of Sail-AWOLNATION is awesome.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The 6 main ponys that Are required to complete the game are very expensive.you can spend up to 350 dollars on unlocking ponys  or spend years chipping away at it.
B00322PK2G|4.0|My wife love swatch so I bought this as a gift for her, this is my second purchased<br />coz I return the first one due to some issues, shipping damaged the watch case and<br />about the watch is very small its like design for children or with small wrist,<br />I'm glad for amazon easy returns, They shipped the second item fast so I'm happy<br />it did not reach 10 days just like my first purchased.<br /><br />My first order was placed in a cushion envelope at it end up broke the case,<br />So far I'm satisfied with this order, they already put it in a box..
B00G23VD6Y|5.0|I love this show and can't wait to see what happens through the rest of the season! Daryl & Michonne are my two fave characters right now! Hoping that nothing happens to them in this season! Would like to see a little more happiness along with all the struggle!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|These guys do it again. Can't wait to watch season 5. Awesome story and acting. Will be buying season after season!
B001TH16DI|5.0|These are the best classic Star Trek for anyone's collection. My wife and grandkids have been watching and really thing they are out of this world! Ha
B00CHVIAS4|4.0|I liked it because it is about cavemen and that is not a common subject in cartoons. I especially liked Cloris Leachman voicing the Grandma.
0817439390|5.0|Everyone who love photography must read it. Contains very valuable information. And easy to understand.<br />I did not have early editions.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love this book!! The author makes Father Time real and keeps you interested from the time you start reading. Didn't want to put it down!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I love this game and it's about the only one I play.  I downloaded the update and now it doesn't even open.  Is anyone else having the same problem?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was the old Steve king and really a great read and fu to read as it kind of mentioned a lot about an organization that I have belonged to for may tears and the representation was done well and believable
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|There were probably a lot of people who watched this movie once, and walked away shaking their heads thinking what thee heck was that! Some, like myself, saw something in the first viewing that said &#34;Watch me again, and pay close attention.&#34;<br /><br />I did, and it was a revelation! The premise of the movie is the affects of action taken today or yesterday will have implications that you will probably never see.<br /><br />By watching the movie with a more discerning eye, I found an incredible story made even batter by the acting of Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. They are, individually, two of my favorite actors. Put them together in a movie of this depth, and magic happens.<br /><br />I could sit here and try to explain the movie, but would end up rambling on forever because there is so much going on in the nuance and subtleties of the film, it cannot be easily described.<br /><br />What I can say is, if you want a thought provoking experience rarely seen on the big screen, watch it again (if you've already seen it), with a more discerning eye. If you haven't seen it, pop some popcorn, pour yourself something to drink, turn off anything creating ambient noise, and clear your mind for an absolutely mind-bending story.
B004LWZW24|3.0|I love scary movies but most don't scare me.  This one was beyond creepy and frightening to start with.  Then they explained the reasons behind the actions and the scare factor went away for both of us watching it.<br /><br />Overall, a good movie.  Mediocre bordering on weak ending.  Spectacular beginning.<br /><br />I don't regret the 2 hours I spent but not a movie I'd highly recommend.
B008Y6WESI|3.0|this is a good movie with good acting and god story I was able to watch it though for the first time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter had a ball playing this. It's like hide and seek but better hiding spots. Down side is not many rooms. We finished the game in maybe 20 minutes
1451627297|5.0|I have read a lot of novels and this is a great read! I love Stephen King,  but this is a different style and is awesome!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|More mature Katy. I like most of the songs. There are few potential hits!. Like Bday, Legendary Lovers, This Is How We Do, Dark Horse and of course Unconditionally. Keep the good work KP!
B005NFVZTM|2.0|\\"X-men: First Class\\" is to X-men what \\"Muppet Babies\\" was to the Muppets.  A pale companion to the three original X-Men movies.  I give two stars, one of those stars being for Wolverine's great cameo.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My four year old loves this game- soothing soundtrack, great colorful graphics, and lots of interaction when collecting your various points.  As long as your child isn't focused on the &quot;missions&quot; it's highly recommended.<br /><br />However, the aforementioned missions take a LONG time to accomplish unless you shell out for some in-app purchases. I have no issue with this business model per se, just be advised when deciding on introducing this game to your young one....if your child has basic reading skills, s/he will see very quickly how to get to those goals and you'll be the one having to decide how to say No!
B00280LYIM|5.0|Really good book , ok ending , want to read the next series, imagination required , kid friendly but any body would like it
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|A gift for 2 nephews that love the Walking Dead Series, the shipping was very fast, and they were very happy, and amazed on how life like the figures were.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a fun game I love it and I can't stop playing the game. You should really download this game. It's good for kids and adults.
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|Beautiful song, I like how real the lyrics are.  I am going to use it for my wedding next year.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Very cool game.  Love G5 and big fish games.  Difficult but not impossible puzzles.  Pretty easy to make forward progress.  Overall I would suggest this<br />game a little high priced.
0307895475|5.0|Outstanding guide. Everything I need to know and more about Skyrim is in this book. It answers questions I don't even know to ask.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I lost my first copy of #1 and needed to replace it.  The Beatles were my favorite group.  I's a classic.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|I fell in love the first time I heard this album. The melodies are both beautiful and haunting and evoke strong feelings, they make me just want to close my eyes and lean back and be one with the music. I think it's possibly his best album, it's just perfect!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|If you select one of your friends on the Candy Crush board, it will not ID them like it does on Facebook. So if they change their profile pic, you will not know who they are in the board
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent book about religious symbolism through the ages.  Don't know why I waited so long too read Dan Brown.  He has such a way with words!
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Great movie - kept the flow and my attention going.  Great actors and location was prefect.  Thanks for providing this great movie to us.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy is dark and serious but utterly impossible to stop reading.  I recommend reading all three books in order.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Great game played it till I beat it.The game needs to be longer but I would recommend pit to anyone that likes these kind of games. Please add  more levels
0007248016|5.0|If you think you hate Gordon Ramsay, think again!  Buy this book and experience the softer side of this guru!  It's worth the buy and it is read by him.  It doesn't get any better!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game. It gives you the chance to build your own park, hence the name, but also includes underwater and glacial parks too (after a certain level). It does make you think \\"what is more important, evolving my $&?? Or building a new whatever\\".  It does require patients as you need to gather coins, however this gets faster the higher level  reach. You definitely need self control not to buy stuff with real money, so many extras to tempt you. But still a fabulous game, highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loads of fun levels! My 8 &amp; 6 year olds love playing too. Great game! Complexity increases at higher levels.
B009V0TV6O|2.0|I decided to go ahead and give this app a shot, after reading some of the reviews and all this mess about the free version, I thought it had been fixed a bunch of people that said they had already gotten the full version. Well I decided to go ahead and give it a shot then after all I am a musician. And like everyone else I seem to have gotten the free version. Well I'm sure this was just a mistake on Amazon's part. However for them it's going to be a fatal error, is my time is very valuable I don't have a lot of extra time in my day there for deleting it from the cloud, then reinstalling it with hopes that it might actually be the correct version, is definitely not going to happen here.

B00E8AVNBI|5.0|Danny Trejo, the one who made his movie career with his very recognizable face, is a busy man and he is enjoying his Hollywood moment. With a new \\"Machete\\" - yes, that guy -- film coming out pretty soon, he is at the top of his game. \\"Dead in Tombstone\\" is an enjoyable western, with a dose of fun and horror, released just in time for Halloween.<br /><br />Right at the beginning of the movie, we meet the devil (Mickey Rourke) taking about how evil the west is, saying at one point that \\"in the west, I never go hungry.\\" Then we are taken to the last minutes of Red Cavanaugh (an aged and unrecognizable Anthony Michael Hall), who is about to meet his maker by hanging. However, he is saved at the last minute by his buddies from the Black Water Gang, led by Guerrero de la Paz (Trejo). Once free, and celebrating his escape with the gang, Red tells Guerrero that he has a new plan to make money. He informs Guerrero that there is a dispute over the ownership of a large quantity of gold in the town of Edendale, in Colorado, and that the gold is being stored in the local bank. Red thinks that they should rob the bank and that the job should be easy. Guerrero agrees with him, and off they go. Lucky for them, everything goes smoothly for them, and they secure the gold. Unfortunately, Red had another plan: become the town's new marshal (having killed the current one during the robbery), and rule it with the help of his crime partners. Guerrero is against that (he is a bandit, but has some morals) and is shot to death. Enter the devil (Rourke), who accepts an offer from Guerrero (in hell by now) that he can't refuse.<br /><br />\\"Dead in Tombstone\\" was filmed in Romania, with beautiful, snowy landscapes, good production design, and directed by Roel René. The movie is colorful, yet dark when it needs to be, and successfully mixes western with horror. It has some great lines, like when Red tells Guerrero, \\"You don't have to do this, brother. There is plenty of gold to go around,\\" to which Guerrero responds, \\"I prefer lead.\\" The film also has plenty suspense, and it will remind you of a Gary Cooper's classic called \\"High Noon.\\" In fact, in one scene, the devil tells Guerrero that it's \\"high noon, hombre.\\" The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital unrated edition includes deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, commentaries, and more. (USA, 2013, color, 100 min plus additional materials)<br /><br />Reviewed on October 24, 2013 by Eric Gonzalez for Universal Blu-Ray
B00ES27W7K|5.0|This novel is a complete departure from the wonderful Harry Potter books, which give me hope for the next generation as I can't imagine the many fans not wishing they could go to Hogwarts School instead of what we call the public education system.  Casual Vacancy is a portrait of a British small town.  There are dozens of characters, all wonderfully detailed, and all of it is somehow tied together by the death of a man of significance (Barry Fairbrother) and his impact on the town of Pagford.  All classes and types of people are represented here in the most complete characterization of humanity in its current struggles.  Nobody has done it better!!  Rowling is a major writer.
1455576387|5.0|Baldacci is the best! King & Maxwell are a winning team & Split Second keeps you riveted from the start.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game and I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the game freezing up. I especially love the 5 free daily tournament games you get.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game! The moment I downloaded it and started playing, I couldn't put it down. Very addictive. This is a good game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm a puzzle lover so this game is fantastic. Its hard enough to be intriguing but not so hard its frustrating. Its a perfect balance.
B00FGJNS72|5.0|You should definitely get this app if you are thinking about it. I have successfully completed numerous school assignments and my resum&eacute;. Although it needs spellchecker and some new effects for texts, etc. it is highly useful and saves a lot of time, especially when you are able to create you docs, spread sheets and slideshows on the go.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really like this angry birds game, it's so much different than the rest. It's a lot more fun trying to save the birds in the cages than killing those stupid green pigs.
006202406X|5.0|I have just started reading it and I love it! Roth is a phenomenal author. The product was new and gorgeous and the shipping was excellent. I received it the day after it was released.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book may not be for everyone, but it was definitely for me, I bought this series and within a week I had it read!! Great background and story behind both main characters and very good story line..people complain that its &#34;porn&#34; but for more me it was tastefully done !! The whole series isn't just about the &#34;red room&#34; that we all hear about...its a love story and an intense one at that !!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|After reading Divergent I was hooked! Eagerly awaited for Insurgent and was not disappointed. I have waited months for the final book and even reread the first two last month in anticipation of Allegiant.....WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT is all I can say. It's almost as if another person took over and wrote this book. Hated the switching back and forth of Tris & Tobias' POV. Hated the ending. Who does that?? This definitely has me debating on whether I will even consider watching the movie in March just to be lead to experience this end result again.  I can think of many ways that this trilogy could have ended better. I have recommended this trilogy for the last time. Sorry Veronica Roth, you have lost a devoted reader.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|I thought Daemon and Freedom were great.  I was really excited to read this one, and really wanted to like it.  The drone & ant stuff was interesting, but the story and characters were not, and i didnt feel like the ending wrapped things up.  I have high hopes for his next book though, and plan on reading it!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed the bridge between The Shining and Doctor Sleep.  There was just enough background included for the reader who never read The Shining and plenty of new and creative material to make Doctor Sleep be able to stand by itself.  I couldn't put it down.  I kept wondering where the storyline would go next.  I was definitely not disappointed.

B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|It is hard to nail down where this movie went wrong; you have A list actors, a great story line potential, what looks like a great budget - and nothing comes together.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />Story Line:  Its hard to tell a good story within the attention span of most people today, but the ending of this movie was so predictable that a 3 year old would have demanded their money back.  I mean seriously; this is the best you can come up with?  Next time hire a 6th grader to polish off the ending, at least they could have through up something 'as good.'<br /><br />Actors / Talent : I hate projecting 'roles' on actors, but in all reality we expect things from certain actors - I will admit they can surprise us and do other things well, we just didn't know, but it is a rare surprise as well.  Tom Cruise as a cowboy space jockey just didn't work - just drive a stake through my chest, it would have been more entertaining.  Morgan Freeman was almost believable in his role, but once he tried to be the action hero guy he fell on his face as well.  The 'female' talent was obviously selected for the T&A bling quality of who will show the most.  The rest of the forgettable cast we never got to know enough to care that they were wiped out.<br /><br />Visuals: Of course a talented CGI department and great camera's are about all you need now a-days to pull of great looks; there is no real disappointment with that in this one.  Huge ocean sucking reactors and flying space drones were about the best part of the movie: but that can only eat up so much time.<br /><br />If they had spent as much money on the writers as they did on the rest of the crew to make this movie, they may have made something worth watching - but given the chance to watch this movie again; I will hit TV-Land for a rerun of Captain Kangaroo.
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|another hidden picture game but the setting never changes only the hidden objects do.....I found it on the side of boring
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The old episodes were 'revamped' to 'try' and bring them up to today's standards; and it falls a bit short IMHO (my humble opinion). The new episodes are of course jaw dropping in quality.<br /><br />In the end you simply must own this set if you call yourself a Sci-Fi fan by any standard; While you can tell a big difference in the first 3 from the last 3 movies, it is still well worth the money.

B008602KQI|4.0|If you read Orwell's book, 1984, and liked it, you are going to like this. It is a futuristic sci-fi film that is action packed. In the story the world of the movie has people organized into districts and they select two from each district every year to compete with each other and fight to the death. It makes you think about if our society could be structured that way and makes you ask what you would do if you were selected for the games. I thought it was well done.
0345522478|2.0|Going in to this novel I'd thought it was an urban fantasy series geared toward the standard adult audience, but quickly discovered this was more of a juvenile creative writing project type story. I wish it was better listed as such, so adults who are looking for something outside the young-adult fanfiction genre could steer clear.<br /><br />It's hard to get around the incredibly poor writing. And as for story and character development... well, a few examples:<br /><br />There's a Beavis/Butthead-esque mind-reading dog character the author uses to cram in a lot of expository dialog and periodic butt-sniffing level jokes, a la 'I want to sniff his butt... heh heh heh heh heh' or 'She a bad person? You mean she put spinach in my sausage? heh heh heh heh.'<br /><br />The main character (Atticus O'Sullivan) is no better, as a supposedly 2100+ year old \\"Druid\\" who acts like teenaged frat boy, and since he's also the first person narrator we're treated to his thoughts, and from this we know that this reportedly ancient soul indeed also thinks like a teenaged frat boy. When confronted with a breast? Maniacally think about baseball to avoid an erection! When confronted by any other supernatural beings? Teach them to fist-bump and chide them for not being as hip and \\"with it\\" as he is! Atticus spends pages upon pages of book real estate telling equally contrived ancient supernatural characters what a fruit smoothie is, a blender, an electrical outlet. Apparently he alone has the knowledge of the modern world, while most other supernatural beings have somehow lived in the world through the ages without ever gaining any knowledge of it. How this could be true is never explained.<br /><br />The cast of characters in the book includes witches, Gods and Goddesses of various stripes, werewolves, vampires, stupid college kids who all want to buy medical marijuana from Atticus while he sighs and makes fun of their stupidity, stupid supernatural beings who are either so lost and clueless that Atticus has to condescend to help them, or who underestimate Atticus' superpowers right up until he demonstrates his superiority in all things supernatural. Oh, and there's also a mean old man who lives across the street and shakes his tiny fist at Atticus and tells him to get off his lawn... until Atticus naturally and smugly gets the upper hand on the mean old man as well.<br /><br />I won't recap the story line since others have done it very well, but I will say that it progresses to the standard \\"epic battle\\" scene whose outcome is a foregone conclusion and happens exactly like you think it will. And since stories like this need a big boobed, long haired female sidekick to act as a protegee who knows nothing and begs the all-knowing main character to take over her life and teach her, one is introduced by the end of the story.<br /><br />My guess is the target audience for this book is about 13? I think maybe 12-15, middle school to early high school age.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|and realize that when you're reading a novel about a dystopian future, it might not end in roses. yes, this book is sad, but I admire Roth for sticking with her characterization throughout. if you have a main character who has consistently talked, acted, thought one way through a whole series, you cannot suddenly hope they change simply because you want a happy ending. yes, some of the paradigm is rather trope, but the same could be said for any dystopian future series. it's the characters and world you build along the way that make a series worth reading. and i think Roth definitely created characters i empathized with.

0811821846|4.0|My 6 and 7 year old boys love this cook book. The recipes are very basic but it stirs their interest and excitement for cooking.
0316074314|5.0|What IS this book? I think of the story of the elephant in the tent, too large to be comprehended as a whole (and this is 800 pages), but where everyone looking through their particular slit in the canvas gets only their particular part of it. But there are clues the moment one opens the book, even on the dust-jacket, with a series of pictures of a woman's face waxing or waning like the phases of the moon.<br /><br />Open the cover, and the first thing you see is a Note to the Reader, beginning thus: \\"The stellar and planetary positions in this book have been determined astronomically. That is to say we acknowledge the celestial phenomenon known as 'precession,' by which motion the vernal equinox, the astrological equivalent of the Greenwich meridian, has come to shift.\\" All of which means absolutely nothing to me, as I have little knowledge of astrology and still less belief, but it is obviously important to the author. She follows the note with a list of twelve principal characters, assigning each a house and, in the astrological charts which open each section, a particular sign. Almost all the chapter headings also have astrological significance; to me, they are often evocative but not meaningful. Yet I need not have worried. If Catton wants to use such devices to organize and reshuffle her complex material, all strength to her. Readers with an interest in such arcana may get even more out of the novel, but there was more than enough there for me to realize that this was a very special kind of book indeed.<br /><br />Special first of all in its resonant adoption of the nineteenth-century writing style. Catton does not merely write of events taking place during the New Zealand gold rush in 1865 and 1866, she inhabits the period totally (marred only by one curious editorial decision that I will explain in a comment). Without ever descending to purple passages or flashy description, Catton writes with such breadth and mastery that one keeps reading, even slowly over a period of many days, for the sheer pleasure of her language, even when one is bewildered as to what is actually happening. And also for the slow unfolding of her characters, each of whom has more petals than a rose, and tendrils that reach out and entwine with one another in an almost impenetrable thicket.<br /><br />For if you were to grasp at only one label for this elephant in the tent, I suppose you would have to call it a mystery. At the beginning, a young English lawyer named Walter Moody lands at the goldrush town of Hokitika on New Zealand's West coast and checks in at an hotel. There, he accidentally gatecrashes a meeting of twelve citizens of various nationalities and stations in life, who have convened to discuss various recent happenings that may or may not be criminal in nature: a hermit found dead with a large stash of gold in his possession, a whore lying unconscious in the road and accused of attempted suicide, a rich prospector nowhere to be found, and a valuable trunk purloined or mislaid. But most mystery stories proceed by certain rules: there is a clear crime, one or more detectives, a cloud of witnesses, and a dwindling number of suspects. Here, however, the characters are reporters, detectives, witnesses, and suspects all at the same time. Almost every conversation uncovers new wrongdoing, adds new information, and shifts suspicion, giving us a deeper understanding of the characters involved at every turn. I suspect that Catton sees the constant realignment of characters as parallel to the equally constant realignment of the stars and planets in the astrological system. It is certainly fascinating, but also bewildering -- maybe intentionally so.<br /><br />Among the clues you get from opening the book, there is also one of the most extraordinary tables of contents I have ever seen. The novel is divided into twelve parts, but look at the page-numbers! The first is almost half the entire book (360 pages), the second is half that (180), the third is half that again, and so on, with the last few parts being only a page or two each. I have no idea of the mathematical reason for this, but it gives a special quality to the experience of reading. The first 360 pages are slow going, as character succeeds character and revelations multiply. If not by the end of this first part then certainly by the middle of the second, the sheer number of clues and connections (for most of these people knew each other on the East coast before coming West) multiply to the point where it would be impossible for the normal reader to keep track of them all, unless he were drawing up charts or keeping notes. I began to suspect that Catton, in her sheer profusion, was much less interested in the normal patterns of a mystery story than in the sheer complexity of interaction that results from all these interconnections, both random and determinate at the same time.<br /><br />Yet she does play fair. As the sections get shorter towards the end, two things happen: we get a clearer sense of the facts, and a deeper empathy with the people. There is a highly satisfying court scene towards the end, with Walter Moody appearing magnificently for the defense. But, unlike traditional mystery novels, there are still over 100 pages to go, and Catton uses these to go back in time to events in Dunedin on the East coast. In nineteenth-century style, she had always prefaced her chapters with short summaries, as a tongue-in-cheek teaser for the detail that would follow. But now the summaries get longer and longer and often sneak in factual information which is not in the actual text at all. Meanwhile, the brief texts get more and more personal: dialogues and brief encounters, telling us more about the characters as human beings. For whatever her interest in astrology and character types and planetary influences, whatever role is played by chaos theory, these people act ultimately as individuals, with real hopes, fears, and passions. We come to care for them, in some cases quite deeply. In the last resort, that is what matters -- and that, I believe, is why Eleanor Catton deserved to win the Booker.ird is half that again, and so on, with the last few parts being only a page or two each.

0060012358|5.0|I've reviewed a few of Sir Terry's novels, all highly favorably so with the single exception of \\"Snuff,\\" which I gave three stars. They've entertained, produced laughter ranging from snickering to LMAO belly laughs to giggles and they've even made me think and see some things in a new light.<br />This is the first Discworld novel that I love in an emotional sense. It produced a genuine feeling of empathy in me. For rats, even.<br />Pratchett really has fun with talking animals. Gaspode the dog was hilarious and Maurice the cat is quite the character. \\"The stupid looking kid\\" thing was funny too. Pratchett is brilliant at writing for that age group but there's no reason adults can't be equally entertained by these. For instance, I thought \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" was an absolutely wonderful tale.<br />Please, please, Sir Terry, could you give us more of Gaspode and Maurice?

006202406X|1.0|I've never cared enough to write a review on here, but to be honest, there's no way around this one. The only word that can describe this book is disappointing. Every aspect of it is. Tris and Tobias go from strong, heroic fighters in the first two books to wussy, annoying, horny teenagers who make out at every turn. Ok, we get it. They love each other. But how about you leave it to our imagination like in the first two?!<br /><br />The storyline is weak, bland and completely lame.  Character development is poor, and the deaths of key characters are pointless. Absolutely pointless!<br /><br />Let's just hope the movie writers completely rewrite this one for the third movie, so hopefully we can all get some resolution and Tris and Four get the ending they deserve!
B000002KDS|4.0|This cd wasn't as new as it was advertised to be but it did work and I still enjoy playing and listening to it.

0553208845|5.0|I have no knowledge of middle eastern culture and religion yet and feared I might get hung up on this particular book for it but was suprised not to. It helped to research about Brahmin, shramanas, the Veda, atman, and samsara to get a better understanding though. The book I bought(not from amazon) had editor's notes in the back defining those things.<br /><br />The last 1/4 of this book is where the true literary gems are. Pay special attention to this part. Read and re-read the last 1/4 of the book starting with \\"The Ferryman\\". Take on even half of siddarthas viewpoints on life and yours will change for the better and for ever. Happy journeying!

0060919760|5.0|It is an excellent, although dated, self help book on anger, however, it kind of also puts one to sleep with its constant pop psychology.

B0081KTHEQ|4.0|I thought this was one of the best \\"ghost story\\" movies I've seen in a long time.  I was surprised at how many times they were able to make me jump!  The atmosphere is classic gothic horror; lots of suspense, and plenty of shivers!  Fire up the popcorn, and turn out the lights, you're gonna LOVE this one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an unbelievable story, unbelievably well written.<br /><br />How couples pretend to be what the other wants and can be each other's enemies and yet are bound.  How we bring out the best and worst in each other.<br /><br />For me Gillian uses this fictional extreme relationship as an analogy for all of us.  One of the most poignant statements I've ever read is from our female protagonist and essentially states that there is no way that love should be unconditional as that gives us nothing to aspire to.  Love should be the most conditional emotion that exists - otherwise what's the point.  I have to concur.<br /><br />This novel gave me lots to think about aside from being a fantastic read.<br /><br />Can't say much about the story...almost anything would be a spoiler.  Suffice to say that there are lots of things that happen you wouldn't have EVER expected...
1558908846|5.0|OK, there is a newer remake of this one out (I haven't seen it yet), but this is a classic example of SF Kitch at its best. The story is completely outta-there, the characters are totally over-the -top, and the storyline is utterly fantastic. That and the fact that the dialog is so stilted that you'd think that it was mis-translated from an obsolete Martian dialect. You'll either love it, or hate it.<br /><br />If you're unsure, then get it from your local library/inter-library loan/netflix/etc. first as a rental.

That reviewer said that the book reminded him of Graceling. I didn't find this book to be very suspenseful. It wasn't the page turner I had anticipated it to be. I could easily put this boom down and go do something else. It was a good book but nothing like Throne of Glass. Kate's is more of an assassin with a gentler side. Other than defending herself, she doesn't kill too many people. This book contains hardly any violence, no swearing, and no graphic sex scenes. Which is good. This book was a good read but I don't think I will be getting the other books in the series.

B00DW1WR14|3.0|I've been a fan since Vitalogy, but the title of my review speaks for itself.  The album starts off strong with the rocking opening track, \\"Getaway\\".  I would not go as far as to say it's a \\"Last Exit\\", \\"Go\\", or \\"Brain of J.\\" but it is one of the most rocking tracks on the album.  It sounds like a future hit with its catchy strong melodies throughout.  Then comes in the first single, \\"Mind Your Manners\\", which harkens back to the ripping rock of their first Vitalogy hit \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" or the self-titled album cut \\"Comatose\\".  This happens to be the most aggressive song on the album and there are not any others in the same vein.  However, the third track \\"My Father's Son\\" still contains some bite with Jeff Ament's bass standing out strong and Eddie Vedder carrying a strange, chaotic vocal delivery. It is easily a stand out because of this as well as the surprising melodic bridge that transitions it from an angsty punk rocker to an uplifting one.  It only lasts until the third verse that follows with more of Eddie's chaotic vocals.  Next up is the second single \\"Sirens\\".  I'm still trying to figure out what to think about this one.  It's a nice ballad and is definitely their most mainstream attempt for a ballad since maybe \\"Better Man\\".  It is catchy but this is not quite comparable to \\"Black\\" as some people reference.  The album picks back up the pace with their first song named after an album title, \\"Lightning Bolt\\".  This is one of the strongest numbers and a highlight on the album.  The song reminds me of \\"World Wide Suicide\\" only less aggressive and more of an anthem.  The song is structured quite differently from verse-chorus-guitar solo with a Foo Fighters vibe-bridge-chorus-verse.  The sixth track, \\"Infallible\\", is the first track on the album where the experimentation really starts to kick in.  This took a few listens to appreciate and was a grower.  It is the second longest song on the album and does not feel in any way overly long.  This is a standout as the experimentation, composition, and pop sensible melodies are executed well.<br /><br />Now we come into the much weaker second half of the album with \\"Pendulum\\".  The track continues in an even more experimental approach than the previous track.  This seems to be a favorite among many, but like the previous track it has taken quite a bit to let it grow on me.  The music is very somber and atmospheric but it feels a little weak.  Next comes one of the best songs on the album, \\"Swallowed Whole\\".  Previous songs \\"Force of Nature\\" and \\"Cropduster\\" come to mind on first listening.  However, this is the last song I truly enjoy as the rest sound nothing like Pearl Jam.  \\"Let the Records Play\\" is most likely the fun track of the album.  However, I am not a fan of the country/blues rock sound.  It worked well with \\"Half Full\\" but fun songs from Backspacer like \\"Gonna See My Friend\\" and \\"Johnny Guitar\\" (my favorite rocker on the album but for some reason many people dislike it for the idiotic reason they do not like the song title) are much better.  Next comes a lame country/folk rocker \\"Sleeping By Myself\\" which should have been kept only for Eddie's solo ukulele album.  What follows is yet another country/bluesy snoozer \\"Yellow Moon\\".  The album ends with yet another soft track \\"Future Days\\".  This worked well with Backspacer with \\"The End\\" following the anthem pop rocker \\"Force of Nature\\" but this album has too many bluesy/country songs towards the end.<br /><br />Overall, as my title suggests, this album does not have enough umph as the album title suggests.  Do not let the album title or \\"Mind Your Manners\\" fool you thinking this album will be as  much of a rocker as one would think.  I enjoy ballads but this is bombarded with too many that are not as well memorable as previous albums especially at the end.<br /><br />Standout tracks: \\"Getaway\\", \\"Mind Your Manners\\", \\"My Father's Son\\", \\"Lightning Bolt\\", \\"Infallible\\", \\"Swallowed Whole\\"<br /><br />My album ranking:  1. Vitalogy  2. Vs  3. Yield  4. Ten  5. Backspacer  6. No Code  7. Pearl Jam  8. Riot Act  9. Lightning Bolt  10. Binaural

B004J4WKDI|1.0|I seriously struggled to get through half of this book and that's as far as I got! The subject matter might appeal to some but not me! There is certainly nothing noteworthy about the writing style.
006202406X|2.0|Spoilers    *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*    You've been warned....    Meh. This book was okay. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it. It didn't really make me feel anything beyond some boredom and a little annoyance. And therein lies the problem I guess. I SHOULD have felt something after three books. Mostly I just felt like I was being whined or preached at. And my issues with it, unlike many others, do not hinge on Tris's ultimate demise.    I do not recognize these characters. Tris and Tobias seem to have become entirely different people through this trilogy. I guess that could be attributed to trauma and personal growth. Okay, fine. But I don't like this Tris and Tobias. And they don't seem to have grown, if anything they regressed. First of all, I couldn't tell them apart. At all. Every time I was in a Tobais chapter I thought I was reading Tris until he referred to her or Nita or some other character that would have been Tobias-centric instead of Tris-centric. Tobias started as this strong, brave, SMART, mysterious tough guy type. I can understand revealing some of his issues and helping us see him as vulnerable and human. But I feel this book went beyond that and made him seem extremely whiny and needy. He also came off as kind of an idiot. From the very beginning before Tris was even around he purposely took a lesser job than he could have in Dauntless so that he would have access to the technology and codes he would need so he could eventually get out because he knew there was something worth finding outside the fence. He knew something was up with this world they were in. He didn't accept it, or anything, at face value. But now in Allegiant he is willing to go along with some half plotted hair-brained scheme foisted on him by someone he barely knows? After all he's seen? He just kept doing really stupid things that I found irritating and didn't fit with his character. Tris on the other hand became this world wise know it all who was somehow always doing the right thing and always knew what the truth was. She had never questioned anything about her world until the end of Divergent, but now all of a sudden she knows everything about everything and is some kind of human lie detector? I felt like in this book and the last she WAS making judgements based on her feelings (fear, revenge, resentment, jealousy) but she just kept getting lucky in that she happened to be right despite being skewed by her emotions. She started to get on my nerves in Insurgent because of the gun/WIll thing. I get that it's traumatic but when you're in the middle of a battle/war, you can't just give up. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do and I really wanted her step up. She did a little bit in Allegiant. At least she could hold a gun again and stopped whining SO much about Will. I think there was honestly just much too much introspection in Insurgent and Allegiant for me. It slowed the pacing of the books down, made them longer than necessary and bored me. I also couldn't identify with Tris and Tobias' desperate need to please and be accepted by parents who were no longer part of their lives and hadn't been for some time. Of course your parents have an impact on your life and you always love them but at some point don't you move on to living your own life and having more important things to dwell on than what your parents did or didn't do years ago? Neither of them seemed to have trouble cutting all ties to join a different faction and presumably never see their parents again, so why now were they both so consumed with them? Especially when Abnegation families tend to not know each other well or be that close to each other. It was a huge driving force in both their lives respectively and I just couldn't understand why.    I do not tend to picky about world building in novels. Make up whatever world you want. But you have to convince me. It has to FEEL plausible. I don't need to know every little detail, you don't have to prove it's actually possible.But I need to buy it, and I didn't buy this one. I was looking forward to finding out what was outside the fence. And we really never did. I mean I know there's the compound and the cities and the experiments and fringe. But....what else? And how does that all fit together? There's NOTHING in the western United States at all anymore? How do people in the cities live? Are there schools? Regular jobs? Hover cars? What about the rest of the WORLD? What happened out there while the US was apparently destroying itself over genetic manipulation? Did that happen everywhere? Why did no one step in? Or come help or invade once we had devastated our own population? What is the US government like now? Is there still a president? A king? A mutant octopus overlord? What? I wanted a much bigger, more cohesive picture than we got. I feel like all we got outside the fence was the compound which they never left, except Tris one time. I kept wondering why no one went outside? AT ALL. Wouldn't you want some fresh air? Who could stay inside a compound indefinitely? I'd go crazy. The constant our leaders are lying, the world isn't what we've been told, we must find out the truth and then REBEL cycle got really repetitive and old too.    The genetic modification was an interesting idea, but I don't think it supported the plot like it needed to, and that's where it all fell apart for me. For one, I can't figure out why everyone would buy into such an idea in the first place. What do your genes really have to do with your behavior? But okay, people believe stupid things sometimes, so let's say they do. I don't understand the point or benefit of the city experiments when the entire country is populated by GP and GD people. What were they trying to accomplish there? If you want more GPs just encourage the free GPs to reproduce among themselves. Which would be likely anyway since they hate the GDs. Sterilize or kill off the GDs if you're a terrible power hungry elitist organization bent on their destruction. If they were trying to produce GPs or \\"Divergent\\" people in the experiments then why did they not remove those that were produced for their own safety instead of leaving them in the experiment to be killed for being Divergent? Why perpetuate the belief that being Divergent was a bad thing when it was actually supposedly the desired outcome of the experiment? And how do a bunch of GD people just randomly all of a sudden start producing GPs? Or how would offspring of the first GD people even have been effected to begin with. Something that is modified on my body is not necessarily going to be passed to my offspring. All the GPs are better, GDs are better back and forth made me feel like I could have just read The Sneetches by Dr. Suess and saved myself some time.    I thought SEVEN generations was way way too long for these experiments to have been going on. Seven generations and no one tried to get out? No one questioned this tiny little world they were living in? I know there was one factionless uprising and memory erasure, but why was there never a rebellion? I can't imagine staying in one tiny city my entire life and never trying to find out or wondering what was outside. Also if they had been in there for seven generations then how come no one had any grandparents or great grandparents or really any extended family to speak of at all? And how many people were put in the experiments to begin with? After seven generations of people all stuck in one city wouldn't you start to have some inbreeding going on? I mean there just wouldn't be that many people to chose from.    The resolution was unsatisfying for me. Tris exposed the truth to the entire city, which is exactly what David did not want to happen. So I couldn't figure out why he would so immediately and completely trust her. Unless he was maybe setting her up from the beginning. I still don't understand why he was where he was at the end or how he knew to be there or that she would be there when she didn't even know she'd be there. I thought Tris' \\"sacrifice\\" was completely needless and selfish. She was leaving behind a lot of people who would be damaged and mourn her for the rest of their lives. She didn't need to do that. Not only could she have sent Caleb who, let's face it, was a sociopath who no one liked and who contributed basically nothing good to society. She also based her decision off of beliefs taught to her by a faction that she knew was just a fabrication to cover a government experiment. That doesn't make sense and I don't think it would have pleased her parents who sacrificed their lives so she could LIVE, not die. Of course they sacrificed for her, they're her parents who were middle aged and had lived good lives. They wanted that for their children too. But all that could have been avoided altogether since apparently the only thing needed to stop the uprising in Chicago was for Tobias to go and give his mother an ultimatum. The only reason they were going to drop the memory serum was because they wanted to stop the uprising and create peace so they could keep their experiment going. Which Tobias did without serum simply by awakening some latent mothering instinct in the woman who for most of his life really didn't care about him at all. I do not understand why Evelyn and Marcus would fold and give up their life's work in one moment like that, but it was certainly convenient. Except for for Tris who was erasing the compound's memories anyway. Explain to me why the mostly innocent people in the compound deserved to have their memories erased more than the people in Chicago? The majority of people in the compound were just as innocent and ignorant as the people in the experiment. I did not like the whole memory erasure thing. It didn't feel like justice, or resolution so much as revenge. I think simply assassinating David, in that case, would have made a lot more sense. Erasing the compound's memory did nothing to solve the larger nationwide issue anyway. And what happened to the other experiment cities? Chicago got it's happy ending but what about everyone else?    If this book had been more action packed and moved at a faster pace, I don't think I would have had so many questions. I would have been swept along with it much like I was in Divergent and the plot holes might not have bothered me as much once I caught them because I would have enjoyed the experience anyway. Insurgent and Allegiant slowed WAY down from the pace that was set in Divergent. I think both books could have been shorter, with maybe not quite so much repetitive introspection, which gave me time to ponder the other aspects of the plot. Ultimately, I'm disappointed in this book. I would not have finished it if it hadn't been the ending to this series. I think this series had way too much hype and it will end up suffering for that. When I read Divergent way back when it wasn't popular I thought it was a slightly above average, entertaining YA dystopia. Not necessarily the next blockbuster. I think once the media got ahold of it it got blown WAY out of proportion and I'm not sure ANY ending would have stood up to the expectations that were inadvertently set for it. It is a shame that so many people have been so disappointed by Allegiant.    [...]
140006922X|4.0|First I state my beliefs. I approach the creation of Christianity through historical means rather than absolute beliefs. I therefore consider myself a Paulinist rather than a christian (small c). Why? The teachings of Paul within a decade or more of Jesus death are more relevant to us today than the spin-generated retro-historical writings of disciples nearly a century later.<br />The author, Reza Aslan, follows a long line of scholars who have delved into the early life of Jesus and the beginnings of Christianity. The book has 296 + xxxiv pages. However, the text of the book is only 216 pages long. 53 pages of detailed notes follow the text. Although the book is well-referenced, this reader would have hoped that the author could have added more to his thesis, that thesis being that Jesus was an illiterate Jew from a backwater town, only one of the so-called messiahs who, during that time, were railing against and trying to overthrow or work around the Jewish elite who had cast their lot with the Roman overlords. IMHO, Aslan's view of the dust-up between Paul and the Palestinian old guard Jesusologists is spot-on. Without the &#34;conversion&#34; of Saul and his outlier teaching to the gentiles, Christianity would not be one of the dominant religions of the 21st century. Certainly that issue alone merited substantial amplification.<br />Zealot is well-written and quite easy to follow and understand. However, I found it shallow when compared with some of the works that precede it. Certainly John Crossan's two works, The Historical Jesus and The Birth of Christianity, represent modern milestones in tracking first century events. For me, Michael White's From Jesus to Christianity is a far more thoughtful and learned text than Zealot, albeit less novelistic.<br />There has been criticism of Aslan, a Muslim Iranian who converted to Christianity only to return to his birth faith. Again IMHO, all historical works are tinged by the underlying beliefs of their writers. However, in Aslan's case, I believe that his unusual religiousity may provide him with a unique platform on which to base his research and writing.<br />In short, a development of a very interesting thesis, albeit a bit too short for me.

0385351399|2.0|Unlike many readers I only got through 40% of the book and therefore must still be in part 1. Eggers is a strong writer but his whole premise of a hyper-intensive company where everybody is encouraged to do nothing but social networking 24/7 and that the company exists to enforce that; well I just don't buy it. I'm very familiar with a lot of high tech firms, but these are ones that create hardware and software. I have heard some about Google's culture and don't have a clue what it's like to work at Facebook or Tumblr, but I don't think they are anything like what Eggers portrays. As a satire on social networking the book is too obviously Orwellian. Its not compelling and its not worth my time. I put it down; unlike many of his past books it just isn't plausible. Don't bother.

B00001QEBQ|3.0|I've been a lifelong fan of Disney animated films but from 1995 on to 2012 I only saw a single Disney animation in the studio and unfortunately it was Mulan.  Mulan is generally considered a better than average Disney animation and it's certainly not the worst during the time period but I definitely left the theater disappointed. The story is pretty good and the animation is attractive and clean but overall it just is not a well done movie so let me list me reasons for not liking Mulan.<br /><br />1. Mulan. Disney is not known for its subtlety and Mulan herself is a perfect example. She joins the Chinese army trying to pass herself off as a man to replace her ailing father. That's fine but not only is she successful in her subterfuge but she excels to the level of ridiculous. By the end of the movie she's doing stunts and acrobatics more akin to what you might see from Batman.<br /><br />2. The cutesy sidekicks. Disney LOVES sassy sidekicks and Mulan gets not one, not two but THREE. There's a sassy horse, a sassy cricket and a sassy little dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.  The movie is only 87 minutes long and all these scenes with Mushu the dragon and Cri-kee the cricket really eat into the actual story and most are not funny.<br /><br />3. Mushu. The film is supposed to take place in ancient China so did they really need Eddie Murphy doing voice work sounding precisely like Eddie Murphy. Seriously?<br /><br />4. Shan Yu. The main Hun villain is just ridiculous. It's one thing to make him tough but again, Disney seems to know no constraints. He can survive an avalanche, is able to cleave through 3 foot thick pillars and can smash his body through the main support beam of the Emperors temple. He's less like a tough Hun and more like General Zod.<br /><br />5. Here is my biggest problem with the film by far. **SPOILER ALERT** Mulan manages to defeat the entire 2000 man Hun army single handedly. Let that sink in. SINGLE HANDEDLY as in with zero help. But when it is discovered that she is female, Captain Li Shang, who has throughout the movie been presented as an upstanding guy is literally ready to execute her but resists because besides taking out all the Hun's she also did an absurdly dramatic rescue to save his life. Instead she is simply banished. I don't doubt that ancient China was a very patriarchal society but this is absolutely absurd. She is only accepted in the end because she manages to save the Emperor. So because she was female she had to save China TWICE in order to gain approval. Ridiculous.<br /><br />6. The entire ending of the movie is silly. ** MORE SPOILER ALERT ** Mulan manages to kill all the Huns besides Shan Yu and his top five lieutenants who manage to sneak into the Imperial City. As the Emperor is preparing to reward  Li Shang for beating the Huns Shan Yu and his men snatch up The Emperor and dash into his palace lacking the doors behind them. The palace is absolutely monstrous but appears to be entirely empty. In fact the Emperor apparently has zero guards anywhere so it's up to Mulan, Li Shang and their three goofy friends one of which is voice by Harvey Fierstein to mount a quick rescue. From there on the whole thing is just a silly mess including Shan Yu inexplicably going into Super Yu mode.<br /><br />There is definitely stuff to like in this film and the few moments where Mulan is trying to hide her gender from her male comrades are done well. I love the skinny dipping scene. But Disney includes so much extraneous junk including scenes of Mulan's ghostly ancestors chatting and the stuff with Mushu and Cri-kee that the core story is just squeezed out.  The scenes of the Huns attacking are amazing right up until Mulan defeats them and then it just seems pointless. Mulan came between Hercules and Tarzan and although neither of those would make it into my Dinsey top ten they are a darn slight better than Mulan.overed that she is female, Captain Li Shang, who has throughout the movie been presented as an upstanding guy is literally ready to execute her but resists because besides taking out all the Hun's she also did an absurdly dramatic rescue to save his life.

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|All the Quell games are beautifully and professionally designed with flawless stunning graphics and smooth performance. I don't give many five star ratings, but this series deserves it; I love this challenging and beautiful game.
0736430512|1.0|I don't know who wrote this book, but it is just terrible.  I did not even give it to my granddaughter because it was so badly written.  I do not know the story of Frozen, but clearly it must be a fairly involved tale which is not suitable at all for a short Golden book.  Whoever wrote this book generalized the story so much that it is not interesting, has no continuity, and if there is supposed to be a story line it is lost.  This was a real waste of money.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was really looking forward to this, but I was disappointed. It seems like it was almost written by a different author than the first two.  The quick chapters alternating between Tris'  voice and Tobias' were really distracting, someone at Corporate convinced Veronica Roth to pander to the fangirls with &#34;more Tobias&#34;. .<br /><br />All of the depth of Tris's character disappeared and of the faction worldbuilding was just abandoned. People just drove in and out of the wall at will. And how do you just drop someone in to Dauntless at age 15 with new memories?  Wouldn't anyone else notice the sudden appearance?  And you could definitely see a lit up O'Hare airport from the Hancock Building or Sears Tower at night.  I think the only time it felt as good as the other books was the last scene between Tris and Caleb.<br /><br />I think Divergent will make a good movie, I'm looking forward to it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Guys, I'm not going to lie. I hated Fifty Shades of Grey. Hated it so much that I'm reviewing it even though it's not speculative fiction. It took me over six months to slog through this error-ridden, barely believable farce of a novel, and the only reason I finished was because I don't like giving up on things. Even the novel's cover makes the blood in the base of my spine simmer.<br /><br />I started the book during the swirl of hype, and I'm glad, in a way, that I read it. I'm glad, in the same way that I'm glad that I saw the first half hour of the remake of Evil Dead, which is to say that I'm content it's over, I never have to experience it again, and I don't have to finish the rest of it.<br /><br />Where do I begin?<br /><br />The writer in me is annoyed at the grammatical errors (which I'm sure were fixed in recent editions by someone the author threw money at with her now untold piles of cash), repetitive use of words, and poorly constructed plot, which ended in a wholly unnecessary and mundane cliffhanger. Am I jealous of E.L. James' success? If you mean, \\"Do you have a wee bit of trouble understanding why pop culture embraced this book instead of more substantial work, such as your own?\\" the answer is yes. Do I want to be jealous? No. But I'm not going to sit here and rip this book to shreds while pretending I'm not irked at its popularity.<br /><br />The intelligent person in me is scratching her head at the annoying use of not one, but two imaginary voices in the main character's head, her \\"oh, wow, I've never seen a penis or a whip before!\\" naivete, and her obsession with a guy she only just met. I'm not a teenager any more, but even when I was, I had heard of BDSM. Good Lord, Anastasia, do you not go on the interwebs beyond checking your email for Mr. Grey's love notes?<br /><br />Finally, the feminist in me is appalled at the popularity of this novel. Is this what women really want? A good-looking billionaire who can buy them crap, take them on helicopter rides, order them around, and lift them out of their ho-hum lives? The premise itself sickens me. I'm completely over romances where an obvious, built-in disparity of status exists: where the woman is at a disadvantage because of her social situation and the man is at an advantage because, well, women authors are still writing that we all need to be \\"saved.\\" At least Elizabeth and Jane in Pride and Prejudice had no other choice in life but to marry into money.<br /><br />The one thing I applaud is that this novel's success has brought erotica into the limelight. I'm bored with Western culture's Victorian-era morals regarding sex, especially the disparity between women who have sex and men who have sex. The erotic scenes were well-written, which begs the question: Why were the rest of the novel's plot and actions scenes so thin?<br /><br />I wish Ms. James success in her future writing endeavors and hope that she uses her time to craft something that is worthy of her fame. I see potential. I just don't see why everyone else loves this novel so freakin' much.opter rides, order them around, and lift them out of their ho-hum lives? The premise itself sickens me.

B004JHYRP4|5.0|Isaac Asimov was a prolific sci-fi writing genius. I can't comprehend writing the number of books that he wrote, and The Gods Themselves is, by far, my favorite. I reread it every few years and fall in love with it all over.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this book is that of its three parts, I'm not that keen on the first and the last. The middle part is where the books shines, yet I read it fully every time, finding new insights I didn't see before.<br /><br />The book begins on earth, where an incompetent fool accidentally discovers a new source of energy--one that seems limitless and free. I love this setup because *dons cynicism hat* that's how things happen in the real world *removes cynicism hat*.<br /><br />The second part of the book--the part that makes it shine--takes us to the parallel universe that feeds Earth the free energy. The thrust of the overarching story is why TANSTAAFL, but the brilliance of the story comes from the interplay of a family of aliens who discover the implications of their species' interaction with the humans.<br /><br />The family group consists of three different genders of this race, each of whom plays an important role in supporting the family and birthing the next generation. Mr. Asimov's character development and exploration of this little family's heart-wrenching journey is brilliant. It brings tears to my eyes. It makes me want to throw the book across the room because we get so few pages of Dua, Odeen, and Tritt.<br /><br />The last third of the book wraps up the overarching storyline but always leaves me a tad cold. I miss my little triad, and want to to put them all in my pocket and let them live there forever.<br /><br />If you'd like to see how an amazing science fiction novel is written, I recommend this book. I give it six stars for how amazing it is but have to subtract one for the ending. The middle story is the epitome of a five star read.
B00847VY92|4.0|Quite good, read the original Pollyanna many years ago and enjoyed this follow up. Would recommend it to anyone for good reading fun.
006202406X|1.0|The story was convoluted. The back and forth between POV was distracting and a lot of the time I had to go back to the chapter beginning to see who was talking. I couldn't discern between the two voices. Tris and Tobias were quickly becoming annoying, but I trudged on through. I had liked the first two books and I wanted, at least, to get to the happy ending. That was the biggest disappointment of them all. The end served no purpose and was completely unsatisfying.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Awesome show. I am always on the edge of my seat, and always left wanting more. I'm even thinking of going to law school!
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Beautiful work of art. The recipes look and taste delicious. The photography is elegant and the directions are clear. Bravo!
006202406X|5.0|When I went to download this book on my Kindle on Tuesday evening, I hesitated when I saw that it only had a 2-star review (even after 98 people had reviewed it). I read some of the reviews that didn't have spoilers, and pretty much every one of them complained either about the book's ending, or about how it was slow, monotonously written, more boring than the first two, etc. Each of these reviews (and many more holding titles such as \\"WHY?!\\" and \\"I'm so disappointed!) made me question whether or not I wanted to read the book. I was gathering that the ending wasn't a happy one, and if the book really was as bad as everyone said it was then I really didn't think I wanted to waste my time with it. I'd just imagine my own ending to the saga.<br /><br />I battled this decision for just a little while and decided that ultimately I had invested enough of my time and pleasure in these books and I had to see it through to the very end. That being said, however, I approached Allegiant with caution--both desiring and dreading every page turn.<br /><br />Now that I've read it all the way through, I think it was TOTALLY worth it. I'm not going to say this book is awesome, or I totally loved it and everyone should read it. Because the fact is this: it's a tough book. I'm a bit haunted by the ending, in that I am still processing it even though I finished the book quite a while ago. That being said, however, I think the book is well-written; I did not find it to be boring or monotonous. It kept my interest even through the parts that others said were \\"slow\\" or \\"boring,\\" and I think it's pretty cool that Veronica Roth was able to introduce multiple new dimensions to the story even here at the end of it.<br /><br />Overall, this book will probably not be one to which you go back for days afterward and re-read your favorite scenes (like I did with Divergent and Insurgent), or tell all your friends that their lives are going to be just a tad bit suckier if they DON'T pick up this book (also, like I did with Divergent and Insurgent).  But it is nevertheless the ending to one of my all-time favorite trilogies, and I seriously applaud the author's bravery and audacity to make choices with her novel's storyline and characters that she knew would put \\"fans\\" in a hissy. If you're a fan of the series, I really think it's a must-read.<br /><br />Be adequately forewarned: It's not easy. It's not tied up a nice little package. But it's worth it.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Fast shipping and works with camera.  Screen is a little small but so is the camera.  I probably would not but it again due to size of screen but I'm ok.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun and highly addictive!  Even as an adult the game(app) is fun for everyone!  I recommend ed this game to other family members,so they can experience the fun! I
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I had been waiting for this book all year; the first two books were amazing, in my opinion. This book, on the other hand, left me wondering what exactly the author was thinking while writing it. The plot was beyond boring. I could have skimmed over all of the minor characters and not have missed a beat. The science behind the entire concept seemed flawed in many ways. Even the reason as to why Chicago turned into what it is was dull. I was expecting a really intriguing story behind that, but I guess The Hunger Games gave me some false hope. Tris seemed like the \\"perfect\\" character in the book, except for her stupid decision at the end, which is a real drastic change from what we see in the first two books. Four, on the other hand, is weak and irritating. Oh sure, let's be angry at Tris for lying to us, and then turn around and do the same thing to her! I think the most upsetting part about this book, however, was the ending. There could not have been a worse ending. If you had that planned from the beginning of this series, you should have never wrote the series to begin with. It wasn't even done in a way that evoked any emotions from me other than anger at the author. No tears were shed. The remainder of the book was rushed and all loose ends were tied together in a boring manner. Everything seemed to be \\"perfect,\\" which isn't what dystopian novels are about at all. I think the author really missed the mark on this book.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|For the money you can't go wrong with this bag. I looked all over and could not find anything better for the price. I recommend this bag if you're on a budget b/c it does the job well of keeping your camera and accessories organized.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this on one leg of a long flight.  Definitely a page turner and easy read.  Great to have a strong female hero as the main character.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show. The acting is overall very well done, can't wait to see season 4! Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys good tv.
B0053O89KG|5.0|great show, gets better and better, great guest stars, good story lines, great action, recommend to everyone.  great ending on the last disc.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought that is was very fun. That is why I need more. I'm in love with this game because it is amazing.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is my all-time favorite comedy, and season 6 is fantastic!! The show keeps changing and the characters keep growing, but the show is ALWAYS funny!!! I would highly recommend this DVD set for anyone with a sense of humor!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game when board and have nothing else to do. Great fun for all. Fun fun fun fun great game
0307341550|4.0|This was a pretty interesting psychological thriller, though some things in it were a bit too much for my taste. But overall, it was a good read! I would recommend it to anyone who likes things from a psychological aspect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't believe how addictive this game is!! Everyone I show it to winds up downloading it.There's always something new to beat. It's great!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun, me and me child can't stop playing this game. My son loves to play this game anywhere he goes.  If you are looking for a fun game to play get this game!!!!!!!!
B00EOO55GW|5.0|If you're a fan of Avenged or classic metal you will enjoy this album.  Stripped down for a more basic sound than we're accustomed to hearing from Avenged, but they hit the nail on the head.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|I must say this one has caught my attention from the beginning. It would be great for anyone who likes to imagine what would happen if this were them. I love the way it takes this from a personal view. Its a perfectly written to hold attention. I would fully recommend this for anyone who is trying to escape the reality of the world around them.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Forwards the attentive and patient. Rare in an era of pick up and go games. A higher res screen is useful as the game is so detailed that low resolutions blur too much.
B00CEF014E|5.0|when i first started reading this. i thought it was going to be a mystery. Then it turned in to a wonderful thriller. It took me a while to figure out if the husband who had gone missing was real of fake. Was this woman insane? Did she make everything up? what would happen next? I really loved this story from beginning to end. this is one i will read over and over again.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|An Interesting return to the world of Dan Torrance and how his life changed as he grew older &#34; life is like a wheel..always returns the same spot&#34; well said .. A new threat and new friends for Dan bring this story back to the roots of Mr. King's writing .. If you read The Shining and didn't just see the movie, you will be pleasantly surprised . Would recommend it to king fans in general or even those that are not and want a good story. Gave it 4 stars because towards the middle I could not put the book down.. Rare for me anymore;)
B00DCRE7M0|2.0|Let me start off with the reason for two stars.  I hate grunters.  They are the musical equivalent of a dirty sanchez.  If I wanted to listen to a singer that can't hit a note and can't enunciate at all I would eat a bowl of beans a strap a mic to my rear.  Now you may be thinking, but wait, James is not a grunter - WTF?  Dear reader you are correct, James does not grunt, he sings (often beautifully) but he chose to allow grunting onto 9 of the 14 tracks.  For my money if you want to hear James sing beautifully buy Leonardo The Absolute Man (awesome album - and it has Steve Walsh)  The only reason it is two stars and not one are the 5 tracks devoid of the gastrointestinal output of the afore mentioned grunters.  Musically the album is kind of meh - a bit too speed metally for my tastes, but when it slows down I like it for a bit.  To give you a read on my tastes, I believe Falling into Infinity is the best DT album (followed by SfaM)
B00BAXFECK|5.0|It's been a long time since I've found a book to be so engrossing and so affecting. I couldn't put The Goldfinch down, to the point where I stayed up past 2 am for two nights in a row just to take in as much of it as I could. Tartt's language is gorgeous and deeply evocative, and her protagonist, Theo Decker, is complex and appealing. I've been a big fan of Tartt's since reading The Secret History, and now with Goldfinch, she's created something even more impressive and powerful.
006202406X|1.0|I can highly recommend the first two books in this series. However,  I truly wish that I had not read this book. AT ALL. This series had so much potential and would have been by far my favorite series yet.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Prompt delivery.  I own all the other seasons and ad to have this season to complete my collection.  My favorite show.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|When I was young I had all the Elton John albums (pre-CD days).  This was a &#34;must have&#34; since somehow all my old vinyls haven't made it with me into my golden years.  This is solid, frequently introspective and mature Elton John.  The flame of the old days is still there in about half the selections and I found the balance to be more subdued and inward-looking.  A thoroughly enjoyable disc.  The various recordings are uniformly well-balanced and all the inner lines in support of John's vocals are just as they should be.  Glad I got it.
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|Quite simply one of the best chic-littish boks Ive read.But this is a big cut above the usual chic lit , the excellent plot and convolutions of the story are so clever  and is was a very satisfying read! Her best book yet.
B001BANK32|5.0|I loved this book.  After all these years, I finally got a chance to read it and enjoyed it thoroughly.  My only experience had been the movie of many years ago and it didn't do anything for me.  The book was really awesome, tho.  I highly recommend it.  :)
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|If you love cher you will love her new album. Sounds like her usual songs great mix of dance and ballads.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this app.  The interface is very easy to use and the options are just what I was looking for.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a good alarm application.
B005EHILV4|4.0|The mixer itself is good enough. I've found two flaws:<br />1. When powered with the original adapter it produces a lot of buzz. The problem<br />disappeared when I powered it through my computer USB port.<br />2. It has noticeable latency when using ASIO4ALL driver. I did not try the behringer's<br />driver yet, but I doubt if it will fix this problem.
0060264306|5.0|Who said is a children's book? Well, maybe it's true, I felt like a child... reading it again., and again, and again...! I love it!
B00F880BWG|3.0|Excellent quality and great show! I would recommend it to anyone that wants to get caught up on any show.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! I just love it!  Those little girls are excellent actresses. Guillermo del Toro is a genius!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|You will either  love it or hate it. You won't get your happy ending, but the book does leave you with your mind swimming with thoughts of our own society, humanity, wars, power trips...I really love this series.
B000002UQJ|4.0|I really liked this album when it came out, and still do.  Why it was panned is beyond me.  What alot of people don't know is that there were a number of extra tracks on this that were spread over various countries as bonus tracks on CD singles from the single and future singles that Paul would release.  Just scanning the list of versions that came up when I typed in Off The Ground, there is one called 'the complete works', so it appears that Macca decided to collect them all and put them alongside the golden gem that is this record.  If you have this is your collection, give it another spin, and try to find the real extra tracks that belong with the original.  It IS well worth it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love these puzzles,  I just wish there was more of them. I got this app as FAOTD, but I don't think there are enough puzzles to pay $2 for it. sorry.
B00D3NSDVO|2.0|Easy read.  A lot of interesting information during story.  I felt it had too many subplots and made the book too long.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Terrible. From beginning to end it doesn't even feel like the other two books. Just random killing of characters we like. Tris and tobias' narrations are so similar I was confused half the time.  Random bipolar disorder from others in the story have you spinning. The plot holes of government and the serums are ridiculous. The whole thing left me sad for waiting for so long and telling my family and friends to read. I seriously want my money back. If anyone even wants to see the movie after this horrible book, I say down the movie for free so V. Roth doesn't get another dime out of this.
1401938906|4.0|this is a very interesting book.  These are thoughts and beliefs i have had for a long time.  The only thing I didn't like, is, she kind of puts down the church and I don't feel that is what she should do.  Everyone has not had her negative experience.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Looks good and easy to read all the great information.<br />Will be great to know how the weeks weather will be
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book will give you a greater understanding of how powerful habits can be. But it doesn't stop there, the author shares how habits are formed & how they can be changed. The book ends, and rightfully so, with an explanation of free will and how it works in conjunction with our habits, good or bad. Great read, well worth the time spent.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|What a great tv show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have the entire set ,1-6, and really enjoy the humor and watch it over and over.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Don't listen to the small group of blind haters trash talking this amazing film. They'd only be happy with a movie starring Chris Reeve's exhumed corpse, puppeted into frame by frame recreations of a film that's been done to death. This film is beautiful, spiritual and action packed. The best of all possible worlds. A masterpiece through and through!
1442359315|5.0|My husband doesn't read anymore.  However, he enjoys audio books.<br />We travel every month for about 8 hours at a time to Mayo Clinic. This book is a keeper.<br />Travel time is shortened and before we know it, we have arrived.<br />I recommend and especially for special persons dealing with serious illness.
B001CW7ZXA|5.0|Great move<br />I got one for a good friend he was telling me about how much he love movies.<br />The price was good.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of the most touching books that I have read in years.  It will take you to your highs and drop you to your lows with such an awesome feeling.  Being a dog lover and experiencing their lose will make the most relate.  The author gets many awesome kudos from me and I just truly loved this book.  Thank you!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I enjoyed Divergent 1st and 2nd book. However I was disappointed with this one. I won't go into details because I don't want to give away the story but I'm disappointed in this book.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I've been wanting this CD for YEARS!! I can't decide whether to keep it for myself at home or leave it at one of my cabin rentals, so my renters can enjoy it. Decisions, decisions!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|I've never been much of a fan of animated kids' movies. So, when I watched \\"Up\\" I was a bit skeptical at the start. However, my attitude quickly changed. This is truly a movie for people of all ages. And it contains a number of important messages. First, take advantage of your relationships while you have them, for nothing on this earth is permanent, as Carl discovers when Ellie, his wife, dies and they have never fulfilled their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. Probably every one of us have wished that we could have done something with a spouse, a parent, a child, or even a close friend who we will never see again. Second, age is no barrier when it comes to establishing a close bond, as Carl finds out when he and Russell befriend each other. Russell is a boy scout in need of a father figure. And Carl, who by now is a crotchety old man and is initially resistant to Russell, finds in him the companion with whom he will finally journey to Paradise Falls, albeit in a rather unconventional way (as he, Russell, and his entire house are carried by hundreds of balloons to their destination). Finally, don't give up your dream. Some day it will be fulfilled, even if it is in a way you never suspect.<br /><br />This has turned out to be one of my favorite films. I've seen it twice, and I hope to see it again. Adults will resonate with its deeper messages. Kids will love its humorous and more fantastical moments.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|My unit got tired after an hour and went to sleep.This happened on several occasions, so I gave up on it. Another toy for the recycle dump
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Everyone should know about Sgt. York. What a great man, what great achievements. One of Hollywoods best movies in my opinion, and of course a true story.
080419257X|4.0|The book is chock full of amazing ideas. Now I'm just trying to figure out what to do with it all.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|For me,  think it was boring.  I had to force myself to read it, and then I didn't even finish it.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is a very informative area where I can go and spend hours just looking at thing to make or do or buy, recipes to make just one of the best places I have gone to help me with whatever project I need help with.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book puts you under a spell so it is difficult so put down!<br /><br />The book's story will make a exciting and scary movie.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book!
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|Very fun game, very addicting, once i started playing it i couldnt put it down. If you are a fan of clash of clans i highly recommend this game.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I can say I absolutely loved this book!!  The characters were believable, the plot was excellent, and I mean the list goes on.  The conflict between the two main characters is something that actually happens to people not just in LGBT community but in Hetero world also.  But I really enjoy this story because it reminded me of a couple of lady friends I had that was so clearly in love with each other that everyone saw but those two lol!!  For people that are looking for a good book to read you should definitely pick this book up because I am pretty sure we all had that one best friend whether it is of the same sex or opposite sex that we had a crush on but didn't want to risk ruining a friendship for.  So five stars from me Ms. Kristen Zimmer! Ready for the next one now!
B004J4WLB4|2.0|I found all the characters very one dimensional. They all had no other interest in life except for flowers. I want more<br />interesting people with more of a plot.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Did not make the viewing until the end. Terrible action and slow plot. Slow movie. Love these types but wow I was disappointed
B00C8Y21CQ|2.0|I did not like this book it was to scary for me. Normally I love his books but this one not so much. I could not sleep very well I would check  every where in my bed room for the her.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's easy, colorful, addictive, and a lot of fun. It just has a down side if you don't want to sync it to your Facebook account. Without the sync, no one can send you extra lives and buffs. But it's still pretty good, even without it.
0553593714|5.0|The series was one of the best I have ever read. It featured multiple points of view, is realistic, had an awesome plot, and is very detailed. The story line is very immersive, putting great detail in small parts of the story, allowing you to easily imagine the exceptional events. The story was also very realistic, as your favorite character never goes unscathed from a battle, or perhaps his allies are plotting against him. The story is very well balanced as it doesn't rush to the important, exciting events immediately but it also doesn't force you to read through monotonous tasks. The medieval theme also gives a different style, as it includes sword-fighting and archery, but it also includes magic, though it is not even remotely powerful in any way. The story just makes you want to delve in deeper to explore it's contents, as the story goes very in-depth and leaves you at great cliffhangers.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and very easy. You just have to have quick reflexes. Be sure to go into your settings, if your tablet does not have a mic on it, and turn off the airplane scenario.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Game has crashed a few times and have needed to start over again.  Otherwise it would havebeen a 5 star.  Customer service not very helpful either.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You can do asome stuff like multiplying 50 and a hundred I recommend this game to everyone . Love game
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This movie makes me want to go to Carnivale in Rio!  Great colors and animals and music through the entire film!  If you're kid likes to dance and likes talking animal movies, this is the movie for them!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very challenging mentally. I'm enjoying the challenge! It can also be frustrating if you allow the challenge to become an obsession!
B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|Written in a style reminiscent of classic comic tales (without the panel work of course) it's a great ride. Entertaining, light and thoroughly enjoyable.
006202406X|1.0|If you are a fan of Tris and Tobias' relationship or are just a fan and/or identify with Tris, don't bother with this book. In destroying her/them, she destroys the story as they were central to it. I won't even go see the movie now because what's the point? I already know how horribly this story ends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG!!! I'm losing sleep over this game. Now that I can play it on  my Kindle and not have to struggle with trying to see it on my phone it's amazing!!! Thank you soooooo much!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Not an adventure game in the traditional solve a mystery in a mansion type game. Super puzzle boxes!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was drawn to this book after reading the novella by Colleen Hoover, &#34;Finding Cinderella.&#34; The characters are rich and strong, and the story is powerful. If you enjoy this perspective, the follow up &#34;Losing Hope&#34; is a wonderful point-of-view narrative of the same story.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Ar first the character Alicia Florruck seems so good as to be a martyr, but as the season progresses and her character develops, we see she's anything but a martyr.  She has the courage of her convictions annd struggles to hold  her marriage together despite her husband's misdeeds.  Nevertheless, she doesn't gloss over the hurt he has caused her and their chilldren and while she may be loyal, she lets her husband know things are never going back to the way they were.  Good writing, good acting.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|So many people have said it so much better then I will, but I really wish VR had taken a different road toward the finish line of this book.  I have followed this series from the very beginning and through all the long waits in between books, this was not the ending I could have ever imagined.<br /><br />To find out what was behind the gate kept me intrigued. But the series turned too abruptly for my liking, the pace was slow up until the end, the POV switching (which I normally like) showed no distinguishing personalities of each character, and the book was full of incredibly stupid decisions by the characters--almost as if they learned no life lessons from all they've dealt with so far. Where is the character growth?<br /><br />*********SPOILERS************<br />(TAKEN FROM MY GOODREADS REVIEW/CONVERSATION)<br /><br />What about the people who believe in hope, happiness, & overcoming unimaginable obstacles in an ending? Tris did that! She beat the death serum! What things could she have accomplished in their \\"new\\" world? Because, you know that world is still too far gone to really be normal.<br /><br />There is a lot to learn/gain from grief, pain, and coping, but to me it wasn't brave of Tris to go in and save Caleb at the literal last minute because of why he really was volunteering. Her choice was reckless and unplanned, and left me feeling like after all Tris has done, this is how she dies? All the talk about Tris finally understanding her desire to live after being so close to death, and then at the end to turn around and think, you know what? Life doesn't matter to me after all. If her mindset was never in imagining a better life for her, I would totally agree w/ her decision.<br /><br />I think that an additional book would potentially have given me enough information to accept the ending that VR wanted, but I guess I'll never know.<br /><br />*************SPOILERS************
B00000D9TQ|4.0|I'm a big fan of Collins, and I strongly believe this CD is the best collection of his top songs available. \\"Separate Lives, In the Air Tonight, and Sussidio\\"-- my three favorites-- are all on this disc. The other songs are almost as good, although personally I don't like his version of You Can't Hurry Love-- I thought the  Supremes' version was much better. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this CD.
B00DI75SWM|4.0|I like this app except that it turns my tablet display upside down. That is it puts the power cord on the bottom instead of the top.:-) It does what it is supposed to do otherwise.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|what you should expect in a summer blockbuster.. it's independencenter day meets power rangers meets hell boy, which adds up to a whole lot of fun.
B007HIEBV2|5.0|This song sounds very fresh while still containing elements of old jazz and swing music. It's not the best song on the album but it's far from the worst.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|not bad.  probably  more like 3.5 stars. no big emotional moments, but certainly enough entertaining moments to keep you engaged and caring for the characters and story.
B003274QH6|5.0|I've heard a lot about this series and the first season definitely lived up to all the hype. I'm looking forward to the rest
B005SEKMH4|2.0|The writer could delete 80% of the chapters and get the same result. Read the whole book is a waste of time. You only need to read 2 chapters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is mad crazy. I love it! Begging friends and family for lives is maddening!  5 lives don't last long so you figure out who your friends are. :) Great game.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I was mainly looking for something to be able to play Audible Books in our vehicle which is an older model and has no means of connecting to all our electronic devices. One review said that it would play the Audible books.  It will provided the book is in an audible app on a player or phone  or device that can be connected via the patch cords supplied.<br /><br />The sound coming through the radio is very good and clear.  When I purchased the Soundfly, I also ordered a 16 gig USB flash drive.  I transferred several GB of my music to the drive and installed it into the Soundfly.  It found the folders and easily opened them.  it was very easy to find an open frequency and pair the Soundfly to the radio.<br /><br />Overall at this point I am very pleased with the Soundfly.  Sure beats the price of a new car to be able to enjoy my electronics while on the road.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|My whole family loves this movie,it's very funny yet has a good story. Very important to me, it has a nice ending.  My daughter (8) loves the toy, carries it around everywhere.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|My first time to leave a product review on Amazon. Because this thing is really bad that makes me angry. Lots of scratches on the back plastic. Obviously USED before! Bad product! Not happy with that. STAY AWAY!
B00CS74W0C|3.0|Crossfire series is a pretty good read after reading Fifty Shades. Better in the sense that the characters seem better fitted for each other. Eva & Gideon are much more fierce ...and fiery!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Well told interesting story with many layers. I will remember this story for a long time.  I would read it again.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Two thumbs up. Its absolutely awesome. Best utility app I've used on my Kindle Fire. Its great :-), i recommend this app
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This seriously reads like a collection of historical anecdotes and its just wonderful. Don't even bother with the movie, does the book no justice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad Amazon put candy crush this game is unbelievable I wish all the games  I wanna play are free too this is the best thing that happened to my tablet and me I'm just so happy now I'm level 13 let's hope this game never ends.

B009V0TV6O|3.0|With all the other recent reviews about getting the free instead of the paid version, I wanted to see for myself what's going on. I just downloaded the app and it appears to be the paid version (no \\"free\\" in the app title, and the metronome plays for longer than two measures which seems to be limitation imposed on the free version). I am guessing it was a glitch in Amazon's system and they fixed it. If you got the free version by error, I'd suggest going into your Amazon app cloud and delete this app, then try downloading it again. Hopefully that'll do it. Worst case, email Amazon and I am sure they'll fix it.<br /><br />Now, onto the app! Creative Metronome (CM) does its job as a virtual metronome pretty well. My biggest complaint about the app is its user interface. Upon opening, CM goes to the landscape view - this appears to be hard coded, as I didn't find a way to force it into portrait orientation. The graphics, font and animation do their job, but they look a bit dated and just don't quite come together aesthetically wise. The purple and yellow color scheme is an acquired taste. Some of the color choices make the elements hard to see (for ex, the small \\"play\\" in black against the dark purple background). Aesthetics aside, I thought there was one more major issue with the UI. There are two \\"settings\\" pages, and both are somewhat hidden from the user. The first one allows you to change the animation and sounds. I accidentally stumbled upon it when I clicked on \\"Presets\\", which made me realize you can actually swipe the bottom section left-right. I had to swipe twice to get to the Settings page. Looking at the default home screen, you would never know it existed. The second settings is accessed if you press the menu/overflow button on your phone. Here, there's a flowchart on practice strategy, links to help and more apps from the developer, and an exit button to close the app. Again, there's nothing on the home screen that would suggest that there's another settings section.<br /><br />On the main screen, two yellow bars dominate the screen - one on top controls the tempo while the one below controls the volume. At first I thought the volume bar, which takes up essentially the width of the screen, is a bit redundant since we can just use our phones' physical volume rockers to control volume. But after playing my guitar and piano a bit with this app, I realize the developer's reason for the bar design - it's so much easier to adjust the volume on the fly with a simple on-screen touch rather than reach to the side of the phone for the volume rocker. There's also a button at the top right corner that hides the volume control bar if you don't need it.<br /><br />The app does play stereo sound clips as promised. On my HTC One, the stereo effect was present playing through the phone's stereo speakers. For all other phones, you can simply hook up to external stereo speakers via the headphone jack, and you'll get the stereo effect.<br /><br />Overall, the app isn't too bad. It does its job as a virtual metronome, with a lot of ways to customize the beat to your specific needs. If the developer can polish up the user interface a bit, it would be even better. I am not sure if I would have bought it at the normal $1.99 price, but as a free app of the day, it's not a bad addition to your app tool kit.<br /><br />The app only has one permission requirement (to read phone state). The installed footprint is 2.37MB on my phone - nothing too excessive.ings section.<br /><br />On the main screen, two yellow bars dominate the screen - one on top controls the tempo while the one below controls the volume.

B0027MJU00|3.0|Chose this book because I enjoyed her other books, but it did not measure up to her other.  Still worth reading.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|As others have mentioned, this installs the free version, not the paid.  I tried deleting and reinstalling as another reviewer mentioned, and still ended up with the everyday free version.  Hope this was just an unintentional slip-up, or I won't be using anything from this dev.<br /><br />Update 11/8/13 - The FAOTD was indeed the full version with \\"free\\" left in the title by mistake.  Now that I've had time to play with the app, I can say that it's thoroughly useful.  My one suggestion was to make the accent every X beats changeable with a touch, but lo and behold, there was an update waiting for me which did just that.  Think app is great as is; can't say I noticed the purple background, as I'm too busy reading my music to look at the metronome!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love that I don't have to pay for cable, I can buy episodes through amazon and avoid commercials. I can watch new episodes and do not have to wait until it's on Netflix
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Basic matching game. lots of levels ,but no real increase in the challenge.Graphics are nice and bright. I keep having to wait for new lives to generate.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am a Pinterest fanatic and really enjoy using it. The app works well enough but sometimes it doesn't allow me to pin to the correct board. I have to post it to the last board I posted to and then go back an change it after it's been pinned. Otherwise it will go to a blank screen and not pin. Besides that, it's a decent app.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|An absolute must-read! At first it reminded me oa a Maeve Binchy style but then the issues became much more serious than a Binchy book. It presents a great platform for discussion about who gets hurt the most and which punishment is the most effective.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved! I was sad when this book ended. Well written and well researched. I never knew about orphan trains. Highly recommend!
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|This game has way too much difficulty and if you want Zeus instantly it would cost you 100dollars.Also this game has energy and only five games every 1 hour and fifteen minutes. I would rate this zero stars if k could. Dont waste your time on this. Atom costs about twenty bucks and its not worth it. I do not recommend you buying this game.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I have been a Rodriguez fan since I was 14 and had no idea this amazing story was unfolding in South Africa. I saw him at Bluesfest this year and think I held my breath for that time (also I was in the front row and getting pushed from behind). I felt I was in the presence of something great so when I heard about this doco from 2 lovely Sth African ladies next to us I knew I had to have it. I held my breath through the doco too, not wanting to miss a bit. I wept with emotion during the last 15 minutes. Such a beautiful humble poetic man. I can now share this story with other friends as I own it. So do yourself a favour and own it too. :)
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Such a good album!!  I love it when I'm driving, or doing chores!!  So versatile!  Great sound!<br />Just get it!
B005SCSL56|5.0|This book was great. I love it when people put a twist on fairy tales. I would recommend this book to all fiary tale lovers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting on a kindle version of this for a while!! Must say love the game &amp; VERY excited that it was free. However I must warn your its addicting!
B000LB7G00|5.0|Just thought that I would mention that. I recently downloaded that version of SketchUp after using version 5, then 7, for so many years. I have only used the free versions of that program.<br />Right now what I am doing is, through the software, disabling the Spin and Roll and Tilt functions, and doing those using \\"center mouse\\" key with a touch-pad button rather than on the mouse wheel, which would be harmful to your hand in my opinion. I'm making the movement with a normal mouse in my right hand, while pushing on the button with my left hand. Then I move my right hand about four inches to the right to grab this device which I am reviewing, the SpaceNavigator, to do the panning and zooming. It may be just because I am new to it, I don't know, but I can do it this way, where if I have those other functions on, my model goes all over the place. It could be that once I get these down, I can add the rest as my skill level gets higher.<br />Edit to update: I upgraded my computer from Windows 7 to Windows 8, and this mouse seems to have a problem with this operating system and SketchUp, since now there is no response at all.<br />Edit to update: I re-installed the driver and now it works, so maybe it was something about starting over my computer from scratch with a new hard drive and new operating system. Anyway, a big relief for me because I wouldn't want to be doing 3D modeling without this device since I had become dependent on it for saving me the torture of using the mouse wheel for zooming in and out while applying textures to my model surfaces.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'm still feeling too raw from what I read but I'm going to try and review this.<br /><br />First of all, I have quite a few issues with the book that don't even involve..THAT. I felt that even though the writing was really good as always, the voice of both the main leads changed drastically.<br />I understand that circumstances led to that but it was very over the top in my opinion and not consistent with what we've known in the past 2 books about them.<br />Also, I felt that there was a bit of dragging in the beginning and a lot of repetition during the entire book that was basically trying to complicate a plot that in the end is really quite simple. And the fact that it is actually that simple doesn't do everything that happened the justice it should. It seemed to me that the entire mood and vibe and puprose of the last book changed and wasn't totally in keeping with the original, very promising, premise. Of course this is completely the author's prerogative, to do with her book whatever she wants with it, but that doesn't mean I have to like where the conclusion went.<br /><br />Now, for THAT part..Even though I never ever read books that have such endings, I might had been somewhat ok with it if I felt that what happened actually served a purpose. I didn't see that purpose at all, especially with the way it was done and the many things/plot development/characters' change that lead up to it (which I dont want to comment on cause I'm afraid of spoiling too much even though this is a spoiler-alert review!).
B00B19G01C|5.0|Hopefully without spoiling the movie, I might sum it up as &#34;The advantage of knowing Yiddish&#34;. Interesting movie and the person who plays this Yiddish speaking character is himself rather interesting. Supposedly based on a true story, centered in New York State and Brooklyn.<br />Like I said several times already, interesting, which makes it worth watching even for no other reason than that.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really love everything about this book. I read it every Halloween for the past here years. Sort of my tradition now. Highly recommend it!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|There really is a lot happening though all the goings on in the (what is it supposed to be?) sand dune region or something, is a little useless unless it gets developed in a later book, but right now doesn't seem very relevant to the main story to me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive game I have had a hard time walking away. I love that it has so many levels. Would highly recommended playing.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I bought this for my Note 2 and it does not work.  Cannot even get a refund! Very disappointed that it did not work!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Now we know what happened to the little boy from the haunted Overlook Hotel. This was the Stephen King we love the best and it finishes one of his best-ever stories. I loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun!  It works with no WiFi too. Love this app. It will even allow my text to open the app.
B000001EGA|5.0|Some of Elton's greatest stuff from back in the day! Love this awesome CD!!! :-) Good to have it again!!
B00EJB44VW|5.0|Although I am no scholar I have had a life long interest in Yeshua aka Jesus. I was baptised a Christian but never thought of myself as one nor have I ever believed the bible to be the &#34;word of God&#34;. Just did not make sense to me.  However, Yeshua/Jesus, the man, fascinated me. What he had to say about the power of faith always rang true even though I did not accept the ancient Jewish traditions concerning God nor the edited versions appearing in the New Testament and the religion built upon it. As a psychologist I have had great respect for the power of faith and always held the placebo response in high regard. Repeating the words of Gulley Foyle, a character from a science fiction novel I read in the late 1950s, I have &#34;faith in faith&#34;.<br /><br />I also liked the way he rebelled against the political and religious hierarchies of his time.<br /><br />After reading shelves of books about the historical Jesus I finally found one that makes sense to me, fills a lot of gaps, puts Yeshua into his own time, religious beliefs and customs amid the religious and political self interest and forces of the era. Well done Reza Aslan.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can see what all the excitement was about this game, it's very addicting and quite fun!  I really like it.
630577241X|5.0|A wonderful movie to watch.  Very funny from start to finish.  One of the all time classic comedians.  Be prepared to laugh!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Like Carlos Hancock before him, Chris Kyle is a warriors warrior. True patriot and a legend. Chris gives account if the constant pull of dedication to team and brothers. Mixed with anecdotal musings of hazing, Chris and his wife play out there struggles in first hand accounts. Good read no revelation but a good summary of a man who we were all lucky to have lives in his time. He may have watched over me in 2004 around An Najaf. God speed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series did not disappoint. The only reason I was sad is that it was over. Would definitely recommend this book to others!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Easy to see available tiles. Pleasing designs and bright crisp colors. Develop your eye hand coordination and flex your brain.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series did not disappoint. The only reason I was sad is that it was over. Would definitely recommend this book to others!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|If you love Bob Dylan you will love this CD. My favorite song from this CD is Roll on John.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This entire series did not disappoint. The only reason I was sad is that it was over. Would definitely recommend this book to others!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|U should get it .It is awsome. And u get a rifle to and all kinds u start with a pistol by the way!<br />U should really get it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I think that little girls would love it to the graphics are equally as great .
B003B02O14|1.0|I should have read the one star reviews before buying the tedious, violent book which I am now stuck with after failing to read it within the seven day return period. But had enjoyed The Litigator and some other of his books and didn' expect such turkey. Save your money.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Exciting series. Filled with emotional roller coasters and page turning suspense. Can't wait to see what Mrs. Roth does next.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Twisted and interesting. Reminded me of Beetlejuice in a much Darker sense. I really enjoyed the hd quality. Waiting for more...
B00FPH6A70|5.0|This almost made me piss my pants. Undoubtedly the scariest movie I've ever seen. Buy or rent it! You will not be disappointed!
0525478817|5.0|I couldn't put this one down. It was exciting, depressing and heart pounding all at once! It really makes you reflect on your life, your loves and your losses and view it in a whole knew fashion. I strongly recommend this to anyone from any age group. It is a must read!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play. Frustrating at the higher levels but addictive<br />Haven't found another game quite as challenging.  It will take over!
014241543X|4.0|I read the preview of this book on the amazon website and I knew I had to read it. I couldn't wait to get started! It was a non stop reader - I couldn't put it down. It was really good although it seemed a little like a book for a younger age group than I originally thought, so for me it was an easy read.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Fantastic. Stephen King once again at his finest. I loved this as much as The Shining and couldn't put it down.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|This was a movie I had to watch along time ago in High School and ya know what? I still really enjoyed it!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Well written.  Well researched.  Well done!  I have written what I wanted and it is not enough, why there is a minimum requirement for the words we use is beyond me!
B005LJK3AC|5.0|This movie was a complete riot! It was a little weird seeing Jennifer Aniston as this sex craved vixen but she did a great job portraying it!!  Even after seeing it 2 times I still thought it was funny!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Love how Allegiant gave the trilogy closure.! I felt satisfied with not needing to know more about the storyline nor character.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't wait to try the next level.  I have my 4 yr old grandson interested in matching also.  When asked what does candy crush do when the candies explode he shakes his head and wiggles his arms over his head, it's so cute.
B00E00P5JC|5.0|We love turbo! This movie has such an original storyline. A super sweet tale that the whole family will enjoy.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|What a fun way to learn the abc's.  There is tracing and matching with the touch of his little finger.
B00FPH3YQA|5.0|we mt boy friend thought it was funny, not like the first one but funny any way it was worth watching.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Vinnie and I love Nemo and his friends.  This game helps him to be creative.  He gets so serious while having a good time with it.
159463176X|3.0|The only connection within the story seems to be Afghanistan--and that's even tenuous with the long detour to the Greek island. I'm still thinking about it-maybe it will become clear in time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am thrilled to have it for my Kindle Fire HD!  This game is addicting and challenging and fun. Thanks for making it available for the Kindle!
1451624468|3.0|I was expecting some philosophic considerations. But the author is only concerned with the physics of the matter. The physics is interesting but it seems that any complete treatment of what is implied by the title must include more than the mechanics.
B000005RTQ|5.0|Saxon helped start the new wave of british metal during the late 70s and early 80s. Albums like Denim and Leather and Wheels of Steel showed what they had. Crusader offered a more middle approach with its anvil of guitar work and Biff Byford's legendary vocals. &#34;Crusader&#34; rings with middle age intensity in its lyrics and adding it to a metal song just works. &#34;A Little Bit&#34; showed a more fun side to the band as well as a nice arena anthem. &#34;Set Me Free&#34; was a Sweet song done for audiences in the 80s who forgotten how awesome the song was when done be Sweet. My personal fav is &#34;Just Let Me Rock&#34; with its call and echo chorus. An album worth getting
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The support for this is so limited it can't be recommended unless you have almost no other type of tech.  An Apple TV with AirPlay is a much better solution for our needs, though AIrPlay is still blocked by certain developers unless you hack your device to get around it.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Another fab opus.......really have no other comments since I am a Motorfreak for over 30 years now, so my advice is just buy this record and you won't regret it, although your lawn might.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and I cry everytime. If you never seen this movie see it for family night.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good game.  Keeps me coming back!  Now I know why everyone is playing.  More clever than the usual switch three.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is awesome for those of you that are real DJ's and are using this as practice or for those who are new to DJing and want to know a little bit about how to beatmatch, scratch or mix it up :)
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Love all the songs on this CD. I listen to it almost everyday and the grandkids love it too. She has a wonderful voice.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so much fun I'm 18 and love mlp I would play this till my hearts content for ever
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. A fun challenge. It is nice to finally find a game that really makes you think. Great detail and unique puzzles.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun!  Love the zoom feature. Entertaining time waster while watching tv  The best thing is you can play without purchasing extras
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|This movie is fun to watch and has some great actors in it, including John Wayne, James Caan and Robert Mitchum .  It's a great comedy/drama with a lot of action and adventure.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only complaint I have is when you purchase extra moves, you get charged for way more then you purchased, and it won't let you get your money back!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to move cards  you can see the complete column. Plus, it is free.  There are commercials before each new game.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game love hunting games I love hunting in real life I love this game get it<br />Love it love it love it lo e it
B00DW1WR14|5.0|bought this for my son in law who is the biggest pearl jam fan there is  it arrived very fast and he just loves it
B002N9MK8G|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's  Frank was at the top of his game!  I had to get it, because a friend took mine.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I preordered this book and kept checking to see if it may have arrived early. Even with that anticipation, Mr King did not disappoint. I was surprized to find so many inspirational points, satire, and suspense all rolled together. The movementfrom the spoken word to telepathic and back was fluid. I just might rethink taking in the steam of my sauna.
B00821OX98|5.0|The drama is very fast pace and jumps right into the action.  I believe that the characters are fully developed so that the viewer cares about what happens to them.  This will keep the viewer coming back for more.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|The writing, acting, and directing is magnificent.  It draws you in.  Kevin Spacey is amazing and so is Robin Penn and the rest of the cast.<br /><br />The frightening thing is that it is probably realistic in terms of how our &#34;public servants' behave in Washington.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Exactly what you need to just run numbers without the extra buttons nobody knows how to use. It even has a brushed metal look like the one I had in school.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to be able to play this on the kindle and it is linked to my Facebook account.  Now I can play any time, any where.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|So much fun to play with the options and make up your own perfect audible background for whatever you need to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is deceptively easy, but is a real challenge! I enjoy the fact that it makes you take a break and go out to live outside my phone. Fun game!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Chances are you will like this series.  It rermines me of the old Anne of Green Gables.  Sometimes the plot movement is a little slow, but the characters are very well developed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Gives hours of fun lots to do and it gets you to use your brain.<br />The puzzles won't let you give up and makes you use your memory.<br />Would recommend if your into this type of game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I finally can play on my Kindle.  It is great playing on the bigger screen.  So much easier than my IPod.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love this book so much; it changed me, it changed my way of thinking. It taught me so much about life. Thank you Veronica Roth, you are AMAZING.
B00E5N8E2O|4.0|Saw this show at The Joint in Vegas last April.  I had seen Leppard on the previous tour and was greatly disappointed. To me, they really haven't been a band for the last 20+ years. I had a different opinion after the Viva! Hysteria stint - their performance was great, and it probably helped that they were in a great venue like The Joint. They &#34;open&#34; for themselves under the moniker &#34;Ded Lethbird&#34;, playing covers and deeper tracks from their past.  I must say that this is really where they shine.  Hysteria was a fine album, with extensive airplay, but it was a real treat to see them play &#34;Wasted&#34; and &#34;Stagefright&#34; - two songs that heavily influenced my personal music exploits.  You get all this: a double disc plus a DVD for 15 - what's not to like - this one's a keeper for Leppard and 80s music fans.
0143035711|5.0|When this book first came out it was hailed by some as the most important book to come out of the Vietnam War. I think that this is a hell of a book. Even the most seminal book by which all books about the helicopter war in SE Asia are judged. It is one of the most important books to come out of that conflict certainly but not THE book. when one reads this book you can almost feel the wind whip through the cockpit redolent with the smell of cordite. Buy this book.
6305882592|5.0|Ruth Gordon should be bronzed.  Bud Cort is a love.  Vivienne Pickles as his mother is perfect.  The supporting actors are just right.  The script is a jewel.  The only sour note is the intrusive music, songs shoehorned into the film that detract rather than support the drama.  If you notice them, they don't fit.  We kept wanting to tell the singer to shut up.  Not a good choice.
034547581X|5.0|This is a seminal work about the most pivotal battle of the American Crusade in South East Asia the battle of the Ia Drang. In 1965 the 1st Cavalry Division fought two battalion sized engagements in that valley against dramatically larger NVA forces. In the first battle the battalion led by Lt. Col. Hal Moore the Cav won decisively. In the second engagement the battalion led by Lt. Col. Dade the battalion was nearly annihilated. The military and the civilian leadership of the US ignorantly drew conclusions from only the engagement they won and concluded that we could fight a strategy of attrition in Vietnam and win. They were wrong and largely because of that conclusion America lost it's anti-communist crusade in South East Asia. And South Vietnam was relegated to the dust bin of history. It could have been different if you would like to know how read Westmoreland and A Better war by Col. Lewis Sorly US Army (ret.)
B0050UEVNM|5.0|The overall form of this film script is one of a large spiral, spinning down to the final scene in an artful, well-acted and well-paced time line.  I won't spoil it by saying more, but Jon Stewart is fabulous with Gillian Anderson, Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands are<br />perfect as a couple, a very young Angelina Jolie is lovable and her boyfriend is even more so.  Watch this with someone who won't talk through it, and who has a long attention span.  You'll talk about it for a long time.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|The making of this movie did a great service to the brave American servicemen and women who served in South East Asia. It showed there bravery and decency in fighting an equally tenacious enemy. This movie educates a public who do not have, unfortunately, the time nor the inclination to read the excellent book which this movie is based on. Thank you Joe Galloway, General Moore and even Mel Gibson for not selling out to Holly-weird and making this commendable movie.

B0002849HA|5.0|This is one of several seminal documentary's about the origins and impact of the Vietnam War. Other documentary's are Vietnam The 10,000. day War, Anderson Platoon, and The Year of the Pig. In this documentary former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara comes clean about his and others involvement in the Vietnam War. What I find truly heart breaking and unforgivable is that he was convinced by August 1965 that the war in South East Asia could not be won militarily but kept dutifully shoveling young Americans into that furnace until 1968.

B000ZOSMTW|5.0|I have never seen Steely Dan perform before.  I was always curious about who plays what and who sings what.  The liner notes on the CDs give inaccurate and contradictory information.  The audio and video quality of my &#34;Steely Dan: In Concert&#34; DVD is excellent and it is widescreen!  Perhaps some bogus or unlicensed DVDs were released previously, but the pedigree of this DVD (it is an import from the Netherlands) seems legitimate to me!  Thanks for the heads-up that this is identical to the &#34;Two Against Nature&#34; DVD (although Amazon describes the &#34;TAN&#34; DVD being almost 30 minutes longer the the &#34;In Concert&#34; DVD)..  I will avoid purchasing that rare and costly DVD.  I am delighted with my DVD.  I am sorry to hear that some of you got ripped-off with an inferior product.

B00DJYJPLO|4.0|If a youthful sense of hope informs [[ASIN:B001NA6096 Before Sunrise]] and a wistful sense of regret does the same in [[ASIN:B001N9ESQ4 Before Sunset]], then a begrudging sense of resignation must be the overriding theme of this 2013 romantic drama as director and co-screenwriter Richard Linklater picks up the story of Jesse and Celine 18 years after they first met on a train to Vienna. This time, they are an established couple though tellingly, still not married. Jesse indeed left his loveless marriage after the end of \\"Before Sunset\\", and the lovers are now in their early forties raising twin girls. For the second time, Linklater wrote the script with co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, and together they achieve a level of familiarity with their characters' relationship that makes the incidental story resonate in ways quite unexpected. Unlike the first two films, there is no ticking clock manufactured to provide a need for resolution by the end. Instead, the fate of the couple's relationship is entirely in their hands, and now that we have an emotional investment in the characters, that's what makes this entry more compelling.<br /><br />The movie flows leisurely picking up the particular rhythms of conversations that show how words can become weapons. The story begins at the end of an idyllic Greek vacation where the couple has been staying with friends of various generations. As Jesse puts his now-adolescent son Henry on a plane headed back to Chicago, it becomes clear that his ex-wife didn't take the divorce well and now has full custody of Henry. Jesse shares with Celine his struggle in being so far away from Henry, and they banter about the challenges of parenthood and her indecision around accepting a government job. You would think that the stage they are in their lives would not yield much in the way of romantic sparks, but when they meet their friends for a farewell meal, they return to their familiar selves as they discuss the challenges in making human, much less romantic, connections in the digital age. Their friends decide to treat them to a romantic night at a nearby hotel, and the dialogue comes back to just the two of them. The chemistry between them percolates in a subtle manner as they walk to the hotel stopping to ponder the sunset.<br /><br />Once at the hotel, the friction begins mildly when the front desk clerk, an effusive fan of Jesse's books, insists Celine autograph her copies. Although she obviously served as his inspiration, she had nothing to do with the writing and bristles at the request. Then a phone call from Chicago sets off tensions that had been simmering between the two about the possibility of moving away from Paris to Chicago. Their verbal combat scene has the brutal honesty and up-and-down rhythms that feel more realistic than most such fights depicted onscreen, and that's what makes the scene more powerful since things said in the most matter-of-fact way sting with inevitable consequences. Looking understandably worn, Hawke and Delpy know their characters and each other's so well they don't need to sketch out a backstory. We've already seen it, and together with Linklater, they've written it and perhaps will continue to shape their future. The director and actors continue to evolve as much as the characters do. So where will Jesse and Celine as 50-year-olds be? Chicago perhaps...\\"Before Tomorrow\\" maybe?n, much less romantic, connections in the digital age.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is totally addicting.  I totally lost track of time once I started playing.  1 hour felt like 5 minutes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!! So happy it finally came out for my Kindle Fire. I enjoy playing it on my Kindle more than having to drag out the laptop. Wish I did not have to spend $$ for more lives, but just need to learn to be patient &amp; wait until my time is up.
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|Got through this in less than 3 hours, but enjoyed how it synced up with my own personal process right now.  Will be using the checklists and trying to put this stuff into practice.  It's one of those books that will polarize readers into two groups.  Doers and thinkers.  Going through the reviews you will be able to easily identify one from the other, so let that help guide you in your review and decision process.  Once you can answer that for yourself, you'll be able to set your own expectations for the book.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed it, and am about to go live it.<br />Ciao.<br /><br />€
0439023521|4.0|While I enjoyed Suzanne Collins’ “The Hunger Games” (Book 1) immensely, it is not without flaws, some of them troubling. The writing is somewhat uneven, becoming overly sentimental at times, and Katniss sometimes is prone to judge too quickly and to act precipitately, without due reflection. She can, at times, be even petulant and childish. But these flaws do not affect the pace of the action, which is both logical, given the novel’s circumstances, and as implacable as the plot of Golding’s modern classic, “Lord of the Flies.”<br /><br />“The Hunger Games” is fast-paced (for the most part) and will appeal to a wide audience and range of ages. Like many adults who read Young Adult (YA) Fiction, I find many of the YA classics to be quite as well-written (if not better) than more mainstream adult novels. The book cannot, however, be dismissed as simply an action novel, since it can be read on different levels of sophistication. On reflection, it seems to fit nicely into the category of dystopian novels that have become familiar recently, particularly with Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road,” Richard Mathieson’s “I am Legend,” their film reincarnations, and the interest they have renewed in science-fiction and dystopian fiction.<br /><br />Is the book, which at first glance is a young adult novel, a typical example of dystopian fiction? If it is, what elements does it share with George Orwell’s “1984,” Pat Frank’s “Alas, Babylon,” or even Shirley Jackson’s classic short story, “The Lottery” (from which I suppose Collins got her subject)? Certainly the theme of fighters forced into mortal combat in an arena for the entertainment of the onlookers (who are superior in some way to the combatants) is as old as the Roman Gladiators and a staple of 1950s and 60s science fiction from “Star Trek” to “Doctor Who.” The associated theme that the viewers, however technically advance, are ultimately less civilized than the people who fight in the arena is also evident in the novel. (Some of the people in the Capitol even take noble Roman names: Cinna, Caesar, Venia, Flavius, Portia, and Octavia; and these names are obviously meant as an ironic comment on their lack of nobility. Of the people of the Capitol, only Cinna, her dress designer, is respected by Katniss.)<br /><br />So, while its themes are not new, the novel does present in its relatively small scope of 384 pages a kaleidoscope of different subjects and themes. Overall, the theme of appearance vs. reality, a mainstay of 1960s literature and film, is handled skillfully, if at times a bit too obviously. What we perceive as objective reality we, like Katniss and Peeta, act upon; but are they (or we) always objective? Perception is subject to the prejudice and assumptions of the observer. Certainly the world of corporate Public Relations, popular entertainment, propaganda of all sorts, and their influence on the masses are justly criticized in the unfeeling people of the Capitol who, when compared with the people of the Divisions, appear hopelessly shallow, gullible, and easily manipulated.<br /><br />Those in charge of Panem are fascists; they are the puppet-masters who hold all of the aces in the card game; they alone must answer only to themselves or to a few highly placed demagogues like President Snow, and rarely to the people of the Capitol. Those masses in the Divisions are less than human and apparently count for little other than forced labor; they are essentially automatons who perform certain manual chores that allow those privileged the leisure to follow other pursuits, and the Hunger Games themselves are a nasty form of perpetual punishment for an original but long passed disobedience.<br /><br />Certainly the novel is open to many interpretations, and should therefore be an excellent book for classroom discussion. What, for example, does the novel say about the society of today? Is the world of the Hunger Games that differentfrom ours? Is the author making a statement about our being centrally governed from a distant Capitol? Is she a Libertarian, wanting less big government and a movement toward states’ rights?<br /><br />How much individual freedom do we really have? Are we in a democracy truly free? Is the author an apologist for the so-called “welfare state,” fearing that without that social net people might starve to death during an economic recession? Is the novel a comment on the draft of the 1960s? Considering such questions will enrich any discussion of the novel; and similar questions can also be presented on a more simplistic framework for younger readers.<br /><br />The novel’s strengths are many, but it may strive to accomplish too much. Because the novel is the first part of a trilogy, its ending is somewhat unsatisfactory in that it concludes nothing and keeps us wondering, will Katniss ever find out who she really is? Will she become (as psychologist C. G. Jung termed it) “individuated” (psychologically mature)? But, since the book is the first in a series, its promise of more to come is welcome. Ultimately, Collins has created in Katniss a heroine with many foibles, who is often thick-headed and at times slow to realize the obvious. But, more importantly, she is a girl being transformed into a woman by the force of circumstances. She is forced to grow up in a world that is often savage and uncaring, where the victors are too often also the losers. We come to care about this girl and her world, and to believe in the justness and nobility of her quest; and that is the ultimate praise a reader can give any author.

B0031Q0XCA|3.0|Perhaps it's because I waited to see the film After it had already generated a descent amount of positive feedback. But by the time I got through to the rolling credits... suffice it to say I was hardly thrilled. Thematically, the film hits on some interesting ideas-- meeting the expectation set by the narrator that it was indeed Not a love story but rather a story about love. It certainly defied the conventional love story plot points. But, in a sense, I felt like the main ideas were pushed so far to the forefront that it kind of ruined the journey for me as an audience member. It almost felt like, in their attempts to Defy the expectations of a \\"classic\\" love story, the filmmakers flipped too far to the opposite, making the movie seem equally as predictable as the typical romances they were attempting to revolt against.<br />Stylistically, the film was all over the place-- literally and figuratively. The nonlinear element, I felt, was entirely arbitrary and therefore got kind of annoying as it persisted throughout the film. I will submit that the sequence that compared Tom's expectations to reality was incredibly clever and well-executed. Over all, though, again, the film played in to so many conventions of \\"indie\\" films-- the long camera angles, the earthy color pallet, the indie-acoustic/ classic alt. rock soundtrack-- that in a way it seemed like a parody of itself, but not so convincingly as to make it seem intentional. Even the lead actors are pretty typical hipster cornerstones these days. And I'm just going to say what nobody else is going to say-- I am sick of movies trying to gain indie cred by referencing the Smiths! Now-- here me-- I am a sucker for love stories, and I am a sucker for the Smiths, and I am a sucker for attempts to break out of the ordinary. But for me, while I wouldn't say I hated the film... I really didn't love it.

B00FWLDHSY|4.0|There peril is enormous, the action, consistent, and the visual effects are simply stunning. Pacific Rim is easily one of the most visually appealing and action packed sci-fi adventure movies of the year. The key to truly enjoying the film is by approaching it with the correct lens.<br />If what your after is the emotional and intellectual complexity of some of Del Toro's more notarized works-- indeed it would be fare to surmise that this pic will leave you bored and disappointing. But, if what you want is a simple escape into fantastic, exhilarating, monster-robot excitement, then strap in because Pacific Rim is sure to deliver. My initial impression was feeling thrown back into a whirlwind of childhood nostalgia. The thrill of coming home after school watching back-to-back episodes of Power Rangers or Super Human Samuri all came rushing back, but updated and even more gigantic!<br />To be duly noted, Del Toro does not simply offer a completely mind-numbing movie experience with Pac. Rim. Instead, in his classic fashion, the beauty and depth lie in the subtleties. Certainly the film makes no tremendous attempt at positing any kind of overt social or political statement. But, through very simply gestures, Delo Toro brilliantly crafts a film that celebrates friendship, unity, creativity, and above all, that youthful notion of overturning tremendous odds with shear imagination and gusto. While movies like &#34;The Avengers&#34; will surely get the lion's share of fanfare for the sci-fi/ action genre, Pacific Rim offers as much punch and energy but with a firmer set of values that make it suitable and appealing to potentially even a larger audience base. Over all, a great pop-corn, surround-sound, big screen experience that the family will enjoy.

B00BESM14U|4.0|Call me a sucker, but I really enjoyed this film. Emma Watson is beautiful, edgy, and incredibly talented. This role definitely proves that she will have no problem dodging type-casting. Logan Lerman also emerges as a fairly diverse actor that can channel a broad and convincing range of emotion.<br />On the surface, the film has the potential to merely fall aside as another emotionally driven young adult romance. But the brilliant weaving of relevant and up-to-date content with the classic Bildungsroman helps to authenticate the coming-of-age struggles with identity and self-worth. Furthermore, like any great, modern, coming of age stories, the film has an incredible sound track that is Sooo indelibly etched into the fabric of the film that it almost becomes a character itself. The combination of elements really help to contextualize the characters, inviting the viewer to join in and feel invested in the characters' journeys. By the end, I'll admit, I was misty.<br />Great scenes include the \\"tunnel\\" scene in which the three main characters careen down the interstate blaring David Bowie.<br />\\"Perks\\" is definitely a shoe-in for becoming the \\"Breakfast Club\\" or \\"Almost Famous\\" for the millennial generation.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy has written the kind of books you can't put down for years and he has done it again. I love the people and how he developes them.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love the game.  But every time it is time to unlock a new episode, I know friends are sending tickets. I usually have to wait days to get them. They want 99cents to unlock. If you make it so the tickets come through when sent AND stop stalling to make us pay, I will up the star rating. I am on level 170. The levels get hard and I normally buy extra anyway.  Stop trying to get more money.  I go through this wait period with every new episode.  My latest episode I am now on day 3 waiting for tickets that I know have been sent.  People I live with have sent them.  Again, fix this and I will rate 5 stars.  But because of money grubbing , only get 3 stars.

1576754227|5.0|I have been reading many books on performance and achievement recently including Napolian Hill, Steven Covey, Dale Carnegie, etc. I am pleasantly surprised at this book and the simple methods that if implemented even at a fraction, could be life changing. Mark Twain Said: \\"Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.\\" and that's how the name of the book is derived: \\"EAT THAT FROG\\"<br /><br />The basic message of this book is:<br /> 1. before your day begins, have an idea of the tasks you need to complete. Write it down or visualize it<br /> 2. Prioritize them with A, B, C labeling. Ask yourself which task I dread the most or has the highest impact ( which task is the ugliest frog, I eat it firs thing in the morning so the rest of day is pleasant). Give A to that task to complete first.<br /> 3. start your day with Task A and then move on to B, C. Remember if you finish A, the energy, happniness and satisfaction you get out of it would make your other tasks so simple and easy to complete. Plus your day would be a great day. Plus you become a high achiever.<br /><br />Example: you need to write an essay for school, do shopping and go to the gym. it's 4 pm on a Thursday. Which one would you do first? Well, if you are like me, I dread or dislike writing that essay but that's the most important, high impact task whose completion make everything else so pleasant. Essay is Task A. do that first. see how happy and satisfied you are after. Task B and C would seem like vacation after completing A. Result: most important, high impact task completed. You enjoyed  your rest of evening, Also completed B and C after cause they all seem fun now.<br /><br />Now this might seem simple at the beginning but this simple habit requires practice and internalization.<br /><br />Highly recommend to read twice with notes and highlighting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|SINCE I HAVE Started to play this game I have become addicted.  It's fun and My family has a challenge against each other so it FUN all around.
0007444117|4.0|*deep breath*  Okay, so what to say.<br /><br />Did I like the book and was it worth reading it?  Yes. Because I believe this book makes you think and ask some pretty tough questions.<br /><br />What is bravery? What is sacrifice? What is a life worth living and what is worth fighting for? Love? Pureness? A better way of life? To uphold 'status quo'?<br /><br />And, the most, What is change worth? What are you willing to give - how brave are you? - to bring about that change?<br /><br />And with this story, the series ends. I think it ends well. On a high note, even if not the happiest note. We've been brought into the world with Divergent. We realized the world and the people were very broken in Insurgent. Allegiant finally fills in the gaps and will hopefully answer the question as to whether all the sacrifices in book 1, 2 and 3 were worth the change they inspired or created.<br /><br />Don't shy away because of other reviews. READ IT FOR YOURSELF and decide for yourself what you get out of the book. I'm glad I read it and found for myself the message it delivered. I didn't allow someone else to tell me what it was.

Most outsiders are aware of the famine, but this reader never grasped the extent of the mental and physical torture applied to most citizens -- it defies the imagination.  That the author discovered the conditions of this strange world from an internal perspective -- and then put them in the context of a gripping story -- is a monumental work of art.

B00FPH51LQ|3.0|It's been compared (fairly) to Men in Black.  Young new partner team up with grizzle older experience partner saving the world from Alie...uh..dead people.  The differnce is Men in Black actually took the time to develop the characters and the relationship between the characters, R.I.P.D seemed to only want to get directly to the shooting the dead scenes and tried to fit the story around the special effect action scenes.  I watched it, I wouldn't watch it again

Last patrol is definitely one of their best albums.<br />Not because it sounds like their &#34;best&#34; according to your personal preference, it is just<br />the real (monster magnet) deal.

Lizzy, Sabbath, you know,<br />true masters of rock, that can make all different albums, all different songs, yet always<br />unmistakingly them, always good. Well, this is one such.<br /><br />If you already know their music, you may agree that some of their best had just that bit<br />of Sabbath to it.

B00ENXBUR2|5.0|(Update - 6/15/13, Second Viewing: Superman soars from 4/5 stars to 5/5. Gone were any of the flaws I listed below. A lot more is explained with the second viewing. Everything clearer. The heroism portrayed was refreshing because people who did heroic acts in this movie did them because they needed to be done - not because they wanted to be a hero or heroic. The movie isn't perfect, but it's damn close and I am glad for this second viewing to prove this movie is much better than I originally saw it. Solid 5/5 Stars. Now, here's my original review below, unedited...)<br /><br />From the relatively quick Krypton opening, Man of Steel quickly gets to the goods and, like 1989's Batman, it saves us from the rehash of the Smallville chronicles and just provides the necessary flashbacks that made Clark who he will become. I mean, really. Smallville was on for 10 TV seasons. If you wanted to see that, spent that much time in front of the TV. This is a Superman movie!<br /><br />But...it's not the Superman you or I grew up and loved. This is new, fresh, exciting and more real than ever before. There was so much good that was added, altered and enhanced that I embraced every change including one MAJOR modification that I will not ethically spoil.<br /><br />Now, this is not all to say we need to forget the silliness - okay, OVER-comical previous films. If you want to see that, simply watch them. This is a brand new vision of my all-time favorite superhero and after watching the previous entries countless times, it was absolutely breathtaking to see such a new twist and explore a new avenue never been done before.<br /><br />In 2006, Superman Returns simply continued the storyline from Superman II (yeah, it told you to forget III and IV ever existed, and for the most part, most people had, even without Returns.) Returns used the same characters, the same campiness, the same music, the same Kryptonite and even a guy who looked and acted exactly like the late and great Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />And that's all well and good. It's also good that was the end of that saga. Much like what happened to The Dark Knight Trilogy's mythology. Hopefully.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect here. More of the same, i.e. reboot but with all the same themes and the same Superman and his morals? No. This couldn't have been further from the old series.<br /><br />I loved Henry Cavill as Superman/Kal-El/Clark. (Oops, sorry, spoiler there. Duh.) I loved his depth, his convictions and his imperfections. I love that he is NOT the Christopher Reeve version of the last son of Krypton. And just to clarify, I love both versions of Superman. Nicely, now I can choose which I would like to watch once this hits home video and I need my Supe-fix.<br /><br />You may think you know the story of Kal-El, but all that remains is that Krypton does fall, General Zod & Friends are banished and imprisoned and baby Kal does end up with the Kents in Kansas. From there...It's a whole new world.<br /><br />Clark's trying to find himself, his way, his future and his past. Along his journey, he does meet up with Lois and she's as equally altered as is this version of the Man of Steel. Simultaneously, that nasty Zod gang does make their way to Earth and has some things up their sleeves.<br /><br />Will \\"Superman\\" - or so they call him - rise to the occasion and prove himself as a world-class hero? You think you know the answer?<br /><br />The movie had incredible graphics, wonderful flying sequences, great sound, decent score and the acting is believable from all fronts. But...<br /><br />...now that all my praise is out there, the movie isn't perfect by any means. Number one, the writing is off...quite a bit at times. So much so, it will be probably my inevitable second viewing before I can piece together all that was wrong with it. They do throw quite a bunch at you to distract you from any script problems. Also, it didn't help that my 3D-glasses were a bit scratched. Luckily, I didn't find the 3-D all that great, so my next viewings will be cheaper as I hang those glasses up.<br /><br />In addition to the sometimes poor writing, is the sketchy editing and perhaps too many flashbacks to the point it's hard to decipher past and present. I mean, I don't believe Martha Kent aged a bit in 30 years! (If she was real, she might consider that a compliment, until...she realizes I meant she looked ancient back then and still does in present day.)<br /><br />There is far more to love in this movie than those points of criticism. Personally, I was so wrapped up in the newness and fresh aspect - even though I grew up knowing Superman one (completely different) way - that even when I knew there were script issues, I didn't care. I loved the new Superman, the new direction and can't wait to see where this is headed.<br /><br />The incredible action also helped in my fun time. After the comedy Iron Man 3, it's nice to put the action back into the original Action Comic.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this story! The story of 2 girls, shaped by loss of their family and identity, come together and learn from each other. One a 91 year old woman, adult adoptee and birth mother, the other a 17 yr old Native American still in the foster system. The story is so well crafted between the telling each girls story and the growth of their friendship. I read it in one sitting. Get this book

B008JFUO36|4.0|I'm a (non-diehard) Sci-Fi fan, but have gotten extremely gun shy since there's so much bad Sci-Fi out there these days. I actually left this one in the player for about two weeks before I resigned myself to watching it - I shouldn't have waited so long!<br /><br />Some folks complain \\"the story was slow\\" - I think the operative word here is STORY (it actually has one)!<br />It was refreshing to see a well made movie in which the special effects contribute / go hand in hand with the story, instead of simply trying to overwhelm you with what can be done with CGI, and overloading your senses in the process.<br /><br />BTW-his flying contraption was pretty darn cool!<br /><br />If you think it's slow, simply watch when you're in the mood for something \\"slow (er)\\".<br />Personally, I didn't think it that slow (enough action and edge of the seat scenes), but if you're simply looking for an overloaded CGI smashfest, mebbe so?<br /><br />It also has a good soundtrack, which is always a bonus.

B002UHTTWQ|3.0|It is amazing how much time can change our perception of things. I first read this book many years ago and vaguely remember enjoying it. Twenty or thirty years later, after a second reading, I find it infuriating.<br /><br />The author dragged out this story with unnecessary padding and description. I could handle that, just, but the omniscient narrator added to my ever increasing annoyance with the main character, Emma Harte. When the reader is able to see into every character's thoughts, and every person is thinking how absolutely wonderful this irritating, vindictive woman is, it begins to grate on the nerves.<br /><br />Then there is the matter of Emma's dramatically fast switch from having a strong, fairly uneducated Yorkshire accent to suddenly not having one. Yes, she did learn from listening to her employers' refined voices, and from correction by her first love, but the sudden switch to having a completely passable genteel voice was just too much to believe.<br /><br />At this stage in my life, Emma's behaviour pushed way too many buttons. By the end of the book, I just wanted it to be done. Apart from her over the top vendetta, she did the one thing as a parent I consider odious. She played favourites with her children and then with her grandchildren. As for the grandchildren, sneaky, suck ups for the most part, all too happy to verbally knife their aunts and uncles to win points with their grandmother.<br /><br />I probably would give it 2 stars, and yet I have to take into account that this book was written a long time ago and attitudes have perhaps changed. My feelings toward It definitely have. So to be fair, I'll rate it right in the middle of the road. I had originally planned to read the whole series, but my aversion to the character, her granddaughter and the storytelling style in this has made me stop right here, at the end of Book 1.

B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Typical build a &#34;world&#34; kind of game at the pr-school level.  Good graphics.  Biggest gripe is need to purchase &#34;peanuts&#34; to create anything significant.  Very frustrating for my grandson.  He would have to get a part time job to afford the in app purchasing necessary to do the things suggested by the on-screen prompts.  Also, they refer to a mandatory tutorial that you have to take before you can expand the zoo, but I've looked everywhere and I sure can't find it, so we are stuck.  Bad feature.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|There is a lot to like about John Grisham's novel SYCAMORE ROW. Grisham has always been a great storyteller and that's once again the case in his latest novel. His ability to touch on issues of racism and social injustice while spinning a great tale are nearly unparalleled in fiction today.<br /><br />As advertised, in SYCAMORE ROW Grisham returns his readers to Clanton, Mississippi and the cast of characters from his classic best seller A TIME TO KILL. Along with lawyer Jake Brigance and his family, readers will recognize the sheriff as well as a host of lawyers, newspaper writers, and judges.<br /><br />What I didn't expect - although if you think about it, it makes sense and I'm sure other readers had anticipated this - is how much Grisham builds from the events in A TIME TO KILL to develop the character of his protagonist lawyer Brigance. I won't write any spoilers - but if you recall from the last time we saw Brigance, his house had been burned to the ground and his life had been threatened by the KKK, and so it stands to reason that in writing about Jake Brigance three years after those events that Grisham would show readers the impact they've had on Brigance and his family. My opinion is the way Grisham did so is a compelling part of the book - but I won't give away how, you'll just need to read it and see for yourself.<br /><br />The book description gives you the gist of the story - an old man hangs himself and cuts his children out of the will, leaving a fortune to his maid. It's in the Deep South and the element of race plays a huge part. There are greedy lawyers and greedy family members and all sorts of tragic stories. And yes, Grisham writes it exceptionally well.<br /><br />However ... I have just a couple of criticisms that prevent me from giving this book 5 stars ...<br /><br />From the product description: \\"The second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?\\"<br /><br />Well, all very good questions. And that brings me to my major criticism and what really bugged me in reading the book (I guess this could be a minor spoiler, though I don't really think so): all these smart lawyers in the book, and no one ever thinks to ask the question \\"why commit suicide by hanging from a tree in the middle of the woods?\\" I mean really, of all the ways a rich man has to kill himself, wouldn't you think someone would ask that question from the very start and be curious if it had any meaning to what's going on? I say that, because when you're reading the book it's almost the first thing that pops into your mind. But in the story, it comes almost as an afterthought.<br /><br />And secondly, the part about \\"the second will raises far more questions than it answers\\" ... well, the old man who hanged himself had plenty to say in his will and his suicide note and the letter he wrote to his lawyer ... practically said everything you could want to know, except, that is, for the one thing that's key to the whole mess that ensues. But logically, based on what the old man did write, seems he would have said why he was leaving everything to the maid. And okay, I get it, Grisham couldn't tell us that because he needed a mystery for the rest of the story - and that's fine, but I felt like there was plenty left for a powerful story simply based on the racial tensions of a white man leaving his fortune to a black maid in rural Mississippi, without the contrived search for \\"why he did it\\" being interspersed with the story of whether or not the maid is going to get to keep the money.<br /><br />Anyway, it really is a great book.<br /><br />In my opinion Grisham has gone from being not \\"only\\" a great storyteller to also being a tremendous writer who offers remarkable insight into what motivates and ultimately what can destroyor bring success to individuals - a great line from the book to illustrate this: \\"When you have no future, you live in the past, and Lonny would be stuck there forever.\\" It's pretty much a summation of the book - a lot of people with seemingly no future, a lot of people stuck in the past, and some who, no matter how many chances they're given, you can tell will never move forward and get on with their lives. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed reading SYCAMORE ROW and would highly recommend it to anyone.or bring success to individuals - a great line from the book to illustrate this: \\"When you have no future, you live in the past, and Lonny would be stuck there forever.\\" It's pretty much a summation of the book - a lot of people with seemingly no future, a lot of people stuck in the past, and some who, no matter how many chances they're given, you can tell will never move forward and get on with their lives.

B0000524CY|4.0|Around Halloween every year, we try to find good scary movies to watch.  There are some really bad movies that attempt to be scary!  We can always count on The Exorcist to scare us.  The performances, the signs of foreboding, the music, the noises, the lighting...everything adds up to just the right ingredients for a movie that is consistently voted in the top three scariest movies of all time over the last 40 years.  Although I have seen it many times and have read the book, I still can't watch it by myself!

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Everything comes together in this movie to qualify as the kind of scary movie you can't watch by yourself!  A very mature Daniel Radcliffe is Arthur Kipps, an attorney hired to go through paperwork at a dark, gothic, lonely mansion, with its own cemetery, out in the swamplands of England.  The only road to this home is flooded regularly, so Arthur is at the mercy of the  tides.  The time is the early 1900s, and the only means of lighting are candles & oil lamps which help set the mood.  The movie sets your nerves on edge with perfectly filmed movements behind Arthur who is completely focused on his job.  It is frightening when the fur on the back of the dog's neck raises and he begins to growl at movement down the hall.  I definitely recommend watching this in the dark...but not alone!
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Too few today know of the long and sometimes vicious debate that was held in the USA prior to December 1941 regarding American participation in the war we finally came to label World War II.  As she always does, Lynne Olsen tells us that history in a very balanced way that makes for enjoyable reading.  One learns more details about the strengths and weaknesses of Franklin Roosevelt and his administration, and even more about America's flawed hero, Charles Lindbergh.  Equally as interesting is the story of Charles' wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and the conflict within her own very prominent family regarding the issues of isolation and intervention.  A good read that any American history buff should love!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm 40 and love the game. but I love the movies too. great way to kill time. really grued for a free game.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Amazing... I always hated Star Trek buffs but now I have a feeling I need to go back and watch the old ones. Touche good sir.
B00124PXW8|1.0|What a joke! I have never even got through a movie without it screwing up on amazon! We were watching this and it froze at the most intense part, refund immediately!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Works great on e-reader ! The best thing is that it's free !! Weather when you need it to fit in your life
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This controller is awesome. I play a ton of Smash Bros with friends, and those of you who do understand the importance of having one with a working c stick and not some knockoff brand. This is the cheapest one I could find new, and everything works so very smoothly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really like playing this game. This game can become very addictive and fun to play. My friends really like the game also
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|Blue is the warmest color is a beautiful coming out story. Truly identifying love at first sight and the pressure gay youth face in admitting who they are. Loved it and anybody who accepts love for what it is will love it to.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Love sarcastic John Corey...scary how true some of the Yemeni parts were. Can't wait for another Corey novel from demille
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|One of the Greatest series I have ever seen.  It goes everywhere you don't expect.  Can't wait for the next season!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So happy to get candy crush for my kindle.<br />It is very addictive and I love playing it, as well as my granddaughters.<br />Continue the good work for all to enjoy.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|I chosen 5 stars because it's a great documentary of a awesome band. I wish it would've had more photos with it. All fans of all ages and all kinds of music will like it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The title led me to believe that one person had a secret, when in truth everyone had a secret. I had the whole plot worked out, then Moriarty took me somewhere else. Loved the way the characters were woven together. I stayed up late reading this book, couldn't put it down!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|there are areas where I wish there are more details but on the whole it's a good account of the life of one legend
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I had a fun time playing through all of the scenarios and custom play against the decks in the easy mode. It was fun enough that I bought the expansion.<br /><br />Once I went through the expansion, I found out you could change the difficulty. Once I did that things went funky.<br /><br />I understand that due to randomness, you get bad draws. That's cool, and I get that. However I have had runs of 12,8, &amp; 6 games where I would not pull any useful cards. I am talking runs of 7 lands in a row in multiple games. Also in those streaks, I would pull all creatures and no land, or even all enchantment/spells. I can understand that you don't always have a stellar game, but 12 in a row followed by a win or two, then another 6-8 games with the same thing. Something has to be wrong with that.<br /><br />Yes, I had a pretty well balanced deck, 62 cards.<br /><br />This almost never happenings easy setting.<br /><br />Another thing that sucks, is that at the higher difficulties the machine takes forever to take it's turn. Quite often it can take several minutes. Enough that if I am watching tv, I can forget about the game and find that the kindle has gone to sleep. This means that a game can take half an hour, even if the computer has a significant upper hand
B0089LOG02|5.0|Christina Baker Kline expertly takes you back in time to an era full of strife an  uncertainty...even more so for a young orphan placed on a train taking her  even further from her \\"home\\" in Ireland. The story is so powerful and  moving, you feel like you are there. I highly recommend this book!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game, however it is a little TOO hard and TOO time consuming if you get hooked.  It should be made to be somewhat easier either on the game itself or more time allotted to solve the game.
B00ECU1A6C|5.0|I rented this and downloaded it to my daughter's fire for a road trip and she loved it! She watched it a million times over the rental period. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever!! so glad its available for kindle fire hd. now its read shop and play candy crush! AMAZING
B00BF11UM0|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  The men who stand up to the evil in this world to protect us should be called the true heros in this world.  I am amazed at what they do and what they do for this country.  Thank God for them!!
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I read two books at least once a year to refresh my soul. They both remind me of what's important.
B00AYB12PC|4.0|My favorite scary movie because it's plausible. I watch the entire franchise before Halloween. The opening scene is awesome! Best horror open
B000I9WW0E|5.0|What is there to say about The Big Lebowski, not already out there?<br /><br />This is a movie has developed a cult following over the years. If you like other movies by the Coen brothers, you will like the Big Lebowski. Other Coen brothers’ movies are: Blood Simple, Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou?, No Country for Old Men, True Grit, Raising Arizona, The Hudsucker Proxy, Barton Fink, Burn After Reading. If you like more than one of these movies, you may begin to understand why The Big Lebowski has developed a very large cult following, growing to include the Lebowski Fests held throughout the country<br /><br />I won’t discuss The Big Lebowski’s story, plot points, artfulness, or other classic critic bullet points, other than to say that it is loosely based on the 1946 Humphrey Bogart / Lauren Bacall film The Big Sleep. While The Big Sleep is a classic gumshoe story, The Big Lebowski is a comedy. I will also touch on the fact that the acting is great.<br /><br />As mentioned above if you like other Coen brothers’ movies, you will like The Big Lebowski on the first time seeing it, but like many Coen brothers’ stories, you have to watch many times over to get all the little nuances that make their movies great.<br /><br /> . . . All the Dude ever wanted was his rug back . . .
B00G23W2MI|3.0|She crossed the line. There was hope that the character would get married to Kurt and keep walking without trying to hurt or undermine Alicia and Wil's relationship.  Now we are seeing it for what it is: jealousy.<br /><br />If Diane was out to hurt Wil professionally, she would have let the surprise happen for him when everyone walked out of the door at the same time.  We now see the past criticisms of Alicia in the light of attempting to compete for Wil's attention or affection or both.<br /><br />Wil could find a better partner than Alicia anyway. In my view, it is no loss for him.<br /><br />As for Cary, if I were Alicia and just had to grab an attorney and some client's ... I would have taken the lustful investor (Colin Sweeney) and the drug dealer (Lemmond Bishop) and looked up Mr. Bond (Derrick Bond), for a partner instead of Cary.<br /><br />What Wil and Alyssia seem to have in common is that they would both prefer partners that they can control.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Got here on time and just what we expected, the copy we had was worn out Great packaging and easy access
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book 10 years ago as a teenager and it became my favourite book. Reading it again today reminds me why I fell  in love with it. Ended, Bean, Valentine, Petra. They fell like more than characters. They feel like friends.
B00499NHLC|3.0|I liked this show but didn't love it.  It filled in a little TV time.  It's a bit busy and to over the top for me. Sherlock is manic and at time hard to follow.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|It's a great movie!!  Even better to have the unedited version with all the deleted scenes and commentary, I can watch this movie over and over.
1577314808|5.0|This book can really guide me how to focus on the presence and now. I am so happy I found the book that I had been looking for.<br /><br />Truly recommend you to keep this book on your hand.
0375869026|4.0|This is a great book for teens<br />It is a eye opener for them<br />Parents get this book<br />Great for families
B000RPCK1U|4.0|As I expected for a OO7 movie.  In my opinion, Pierce Brosnan is the best James Bond since Sean Connery except that I am still waiting judgement on Daniel Craig.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|I've just received the Rubinstein Complete edition, and while I've only begun to sample it, have a few preliminary observations.<br /><br />First, What's all the fuss about the color of the box?  What does this have to do with the contents of this amazing set?  Nothing, in my view.<br /><br />Second, I'm not at all bothered by the \\"presentation\\" of the contents as some seem to be.  The book clearly lists the content of each CD as they are on the sleeve itself.  Indeed, the discussion in the book of how the set came to be and from whence the tapes, etc., came is most enlightening. Ok, I do wish RCA had included a CD with the texts from the backs of the individual CDs; like many others, I'm not inclined to use a magnifying glass to read them--but I'd like to be able to.  There are two sections in the back of the book which are useful: a separate alphabetical discography and a chronological discography.  Frankly, I think the RCA/Sony folks did a good job with this material.  Yes, there is a lot of duplication of material but that's to be expected in one whose professional career lasted so long.  There are also wonderful chamber music pieces throughout.<br /><br />Third, I will soon begin the tedious task of checking each CD to see that it's indeed placed accurately the appropriate sleeve.  I've not had this problem with amazon before.<br /><br />Finally, who can beat the price of 142 quality CDs (and a couple of DVDs as well) of this piano master for only $121?  Other sites sell this compilation for $289.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|AN AWESOME GAME FOR THE KINDLE.  FUN GAME TO PASS THE TIME! THE BULLET CAMERA IS AWESOME! EASY TO USE AND LOADS QUICK
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I started to read this book because it was  the monthly book club selection. Part way through I fell in love with the characters and literally couldn't put it down. I finished the book, laughing and crying and feeling that I will never be the same.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, fun, addicting. It's great because this game has challenges you can complete unlike some other games that I've played.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|They've done it again! I think they're getting a little soft in their old age though...but I'm a PJ fan to the end!!!!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|The only problem I have with this game is the prices for stuff the game are really high but still love this game anyways
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game ,fun to play,frustrating at times, tests your patience, great time passer,,keeps me from thinking how much time I have on my own
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Well when its the first time you play it it is hard but I  you have played it before it's easy see this was my first time so it was kinda tricky but I got the hang of it
B003L77G6A|5.0|I need to get the other seasons... as this show is totally awesome! Good job to the cast in doing some research so that even if it is comedy and fiction, some of the facts and jokes are based on real science!
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|This is one of Heyers best.  The heroine is intelligent, amusing and unconventional.  The plot is well thought out with some unexpected turns.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00136JQOG|5.0|10 original album songs plus a few bonus live cuts.  This is Cyndi Lauper's &#34;Abbey Road&#34; or &#34;Born To Run.&#34;
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Haven't been able to find a Malcom Gladwell dud. So the search continues.  8^)<br /><br />As usual the subject matter chages but the sublime story telling continues. I'm hooked.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|After I heard a radio DJ say that she liked the rest of the album better than the single playing on the radio, I thought I'd take a listen. She was right; the entire thing is fantastic!!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Get ready to have your dietary world flipped upside down! There have been several books lately that describe the destructive effects of wheat (and all grains as well) have on the body. The Paleo Solution... by Robb Wolf and Wheat Belly, for instance, are very enlightening and I recommend them highly. But Dr. Perlmutter  focuses on the effects that wheat and sugar have on the brain. The diet we almost all follow is killing our brain! If you know someone with Alzheimer's, depression, schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, or other brain-related disease you owe it to them to educate them on the disastrous effects their diets are having on their conditions.<br /><br />All of these books discuss the fact that human physiology is incompatible with grains. We are not set up to digest them efficiently and their built-in 'self-defense' mechanisms designed to prevent animals from eating them are poison to our bodies. Dr. Perlmutter  explains the effects these 'poisonous' foods have on our brain and goes even further, showing that virtually ALL carbohydrates are 'poison to our brain!' We seem to be so used to the poor health that results from eating this stuff that we think it's normal. It's not!<br /><br />Theory is nice but real-world results mean more. I have followed the dietary suggestions common to all these books for almost a year - cut out as many carbs as possible and reduce all forms of sugar (a carb as well) - and I have lost a lot of weight, lowered my blood pressure significantly and am very nearly no longer a type II diabetic that I have been for years. I feel better than I have in more than 20  years and have zero desire to go back to eating the crap I used to eat. I see a slice of bread now and think 'skull and crossbones!'<br /><br />Do yourself or a loved one a huge favor and read these books!
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|love it and glad AJ did this one.  hope he does more and more like this one.  would buy them
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is brilliant! Challenging and beautiful in the HD.  I wish I had known about it all along and look forward to many more rooms.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game<br />cant wait for the next part I lost track of time playing this definitely worth the money
1401907725|5.0|I always love the Angel Cards by Doreen Virtue. Never can go wrong with any purchase of any of the Angel Cards.
0440246318|1.0|I'll get straight to the point: I don't recommend A Wanted Man.  The plot takes hundreds of descriptive pages to unfold, and then the final scene of resolution is over within fifty pages of the action I waited and waited for in the preceding pages explodes but is over before you know it.  .  .<br /><br />However, what I did really like about the version I read was the author's short story, Deep Down, of Reacher investigating leaked information about a new sniper rifle when he was a captain on the rise.  I give Deep Down four to five stars on its own.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|good game for kindle, I enjoy the lights and sound, if you like air hockey you will enjoy this game.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Having bought a plantronics voyager legend, I found charging it a little bit of a pain. The fact that it has a propriety usb charging cable means that you have to have it to hand for a recharge and as I use the headset at home and in the car, it was never at hand when I needed it. Then I came across this case... The headset it self does not include a case which I think is a little naughty considering that the voyager is on the upper end of headsets, price wise. With the built in battery it means that your headset is always fully charged and ready to use. With one full charge of the case, you get 2 full charges on the headset and if you pop the headset it at the same time both will be charged. Also, the case has a micro USB port so you don't have to carry the propriety cable around all the time.<br /><br />$30 is a good fair price. Quality is alright. It definitely will protect the headset, but I'm not sure how many knocks it will take.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have loved the Divergent series from the start, but I'm horribly disappointed by Allegiant. That is not to say that the book isn't well written, or that the story isn't tied up in the end -- Roth does those things. But she breaks the most important rule to a reader with her treatment of Tris, Uriah, etc, and betrays our sense of hope. Obviously, Roth wrote these books for herself, which I respect. But the moment Divergent became a hit, there was no way to write the books for herself and not let her fans down. She made the choice to write for herself, and now she'll have to deal with the backlash of millions of fans by reading endless bad reviews and angry comments.<br /><br />I realize there are people out there that feel like those of us who don't like the ending are being whiny. I disagree. I believe the vast majority of Divergent fans are so upset about this ending because they love these characters so much. When the story is well-written, the reader will fall in love with the characters, bond with them, and welcome them into a special part of themselves.  And the reader will be angry and devastated if they feel these characters are treated unfairly or the story betrays them. This is what happened here. So like it or not, Roth has now marked herself as an untrustworthy author. Many readers will not be quick to buy another book she writes because the fear of what will happen to those beloved characters will outweigh their desire to read a good story. I hope she's made some good money off the Divergent books so far, because many readers may not be so trusting of her in future endeavors.
0374533571|3.0|I bought the book after reading excellent Amazon reviews. Since I had already seen the movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed, reading the story was just not as exciting as seeing it on the big screen, although the storyline is wonderful.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Poorly written, but decent for a romance novel with a twist... Horrible grammar and punctuation, though. who edited it... not sure.
B00D1VKZ3M|3.0|I was sorry to read that Bridget had become a bit &#34;smutty&#34;. Not a patch on the previous books, Bridget felt like a bit of a stranger.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|So iv practically cleared everything on my fire and still cant download really irritating. it says it needs about 35 megabytes more like 10 gigs
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A fun and challenging game--I am still trying to achieve a better score each time I play! Give it a try!
B000G1ALRK|4.0|The Sinners Like Me CD..... Exceptional Product and Prompt Service..... Delivery was timely and product quality appears as stated in description. I am unable to compare this product to others at this time. No suggestions or recommendations at this time either...
B0012NVGHU|4.0|As an independent film, it is really a beautiful film.  Loved the recording session and the relationship of the two main characters.  In the end, it really needed something, can't put my finger on it.  Deserves a kudos for the nontraditional ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is awesome. It is great for young ages especially. I just got it last night already on hallaween resademce.It rocks
0312330537|5.0|This wa recommended to me by another traveler and I've bought 3 copies as gifts to other friends that have lived a similar life of travel, expat, and total immersion in a foreign culture.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Many different puzzles, timed so you can beat yourself, some hard some easy You can choose what puzzle you want and there are plenty to choose from
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am enjoying playing this game, everyone I know plays and I didn't think I would like it since I don't play online games, but is really good because I feel like I'm playing myself not the whole internet
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is like a bildungsroman, which is a coming-of-age story. It is unlike any game I have ever played and I encourage you to experience it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|WARNING: ADDICTIVE. its fun, addictive, and challenging be prepared to play this a lot. I really enjoyed this game a great puzzel game
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This wasn't my favorite series but it is a good one. Obviously the ending was the hardest part to read but I honestly felt it fit the story well. Like Tobias said \\"a flame that burns that bright can't last forever\\" It definitely changed my view on some things and I think that is what a great book does. The series overall was a good one. The first book I loved, the second I was fine with and the third was a really good strong ending. Everyone hates what Veronica Roth did but sometimes you have to let characters grow and sometimes the only way to do that is to let other characters GO. Albeit it usually isn't the MAIN character that is let go but i thought it was a smart move. This was the only way to help Tobias get over the demons of his past and give him the strength he was missing.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy the puzzles but it keeps shutting down in the middle of it.... its fustrating ...but it does sometimes save where you left off when it shutdown
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book had such good reviews I bought it....I wish I could get my money back!!!!<br /><br />There is no suspense just a lot of explanation of things that have nothing to do with anything.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Think this an an awesome game. Graphics are great. Directions are plentiful. Keeps kids entertained and attentive. Go Nemo grow some plants!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it!! Loved it! !!! Loved it! !  I could not put this down. Didn't get my laundry done, barely made dinner.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is a fun game to play. I like the fact that you don't have to wait so long in between playing times to get new lives to star playing again
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King delivers the scares, and does so using the day to day things that we often take for granted. The death of children, a hospice and the constant battle with addiction. King at his best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing playing candy crush. I find the game to be exciting, challenging, and fun all at the same time. Also was happy to finally see the app on my kindle fire.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Many times I have struggled to capture the right rhythm when learning a new song, it takes a lot of time and tons of practice.  When I tried this app out I got very amazed by how easy it was for me to learn a new song all of a sudden, it's like this app would instantly speed up my understanding of a new rhythm, I love it! .  I've never seen another metronome that could make me improve this fast.  I fully recommend it and would like more apps like this, I am giving it 5 starts to support this sort of initiatives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's exactly like the one on my phone it is amazing I have been passing the levels like crazy it is still the fun and amazing candy crush we all love but now on my kindle fire awesome I have been waiting for this to happen
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Loved getting reacquainted with the characters and I think that was the best part of the film. I wish the film had just been one adventure rather than a mashup...and the crane scene addition was over the top.
B00F9A903O|1.0|This game seemed great until I logged back into it one day and it restarted on me it continued to do this every time I tried to play. I lost all my money ( real money) that I spent on it and all my progress. This game went from fun to none
B001BWDG0W|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all times. Love the music too. I have the movie and the soundtrack .
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love how the game is set up. Ponies cost bits, the mane 6 cost elements, and there is lots of fun waiting to be had.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like the blue LED display option and the fact that you can dim the brightness as well. You can choose between sound and music for your wake tune. Overall is simple to use and has great features.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! on my Kindle.. very happy my crack is available now to keep in my purse on my easy to play kindle... I debated the download because I know it's a time - suck  ...buyer beware
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|After being asked by so many I'm finally playing on my Kindle Fire hd and its an addictive little game...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So incredibly addictive but one you love! Don't start playing if you don't have time. You'll be so mad if you have to stop mid-game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love the depth of the characters in this book. Stephen King did it again. I've been a King reader for a long, long time. His work is only getting better - if that's humanly possible.
B001P7HUF0|1.0|This is a movie with an excellent cast whose talent is wasted by one of the worst scripts for a lawyer-movie ever.  The dialogue is poor, unrealistic, stilted, clichéd and the holes in the plot are so gaping that it's insulting that an audience is expected to find any cause for suspense whatsoever.  If you can endure this drivel, the last 2 minutes are good (and with good dialogue to boot), but only the most stubborn viewer will be willing to wait that long for so little reward.  All in all, awful.
0553103547|5.0|Could not put it down, as I was finishing it I became aware that on the last pages you could find a List of all the caracters, wuld have been very helpful if I had found it before.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game but it's really not that different from other 3 in a row puzzles.  My favorite was Jewel Quest which allows you to build up some saves to use when the puzzles really get HARD.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Was not expecting much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised to find an original story<br />that I have not seen before.<br /><br />Something different then all the recent terrorist themed movies which are becoming a boring theme.<br /><br />The plot keeps changing and was very well put together.<br /><br />If you think you know what's happening you will still get it wrong.<br /><br />Special effects where good.<br /><br />Would recommend watching this movie.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|This was not a very fun game.  The clues give too much information, and make it too easy, and some of the things you need to see to solved a puzzle are so small you can't actually see them.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It's sweet, funny, and suspenseful almost to the point of thrilling. I've never read Liane Moriarty before, but this won't be the last time.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Doesn't really have a thing to do with the original but a great story. 3d looks great! Shipped on time.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|Loved the movie, and this package gave me everything I need to enjoy anywhere I want to! The bluray quality is exceptional, and the dvd gives a great viewing on my regular tlevision.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I cannot rate Downton Abbey. I have a new Samsung Smart TV and joined Amazon Prime so I could watch movies, etc on my TV. I am submitting all of my response on this review because the other email that was sent to me for Margin Call has no &#34;Submit&#34; button and with no way to send what I have written!<br /><br />I never selected nor watched the 3 movies listed on this page and in my &#34;The Recently Watched List&#34;....... but Lori (Amazon rep) couldn't tell  me how they got there. This is a brand new TV and Margin Call was the first movie or anything I had selected to watch!!! She finally said that sometimes Amazon will put some movies in that section to suggest things. I am sure what she said isn't true. Disgusted!! So, I am not reviewing what is on this page but want to submit my experience with Margin Call and with Burning Plains!!<br /><br />I could not finish watching the Margin Call on 10/24/13, as it went into buffering mode and would not come out no mater what I did and finally went to a blank screen. I gave up and went to bed.<br /><br />On 10/25/13, I tried, with a friend over, to watch Burning Plains and it kept buffering also. I called Amazon twice and also Comcast and each one blamed the other. Actually, all Comcast was able to tell was that I had an excellent connection. I could log on and use all the rest of my devices with out a problem. I talked to 2 different Amazon reps, the first I believe was Amanda. She had me unplug and reboot and the problem stopped, but only for a short time. The last Amazon rep I talked to, Lori, said many things, but she finally said that the movies in HD stream in using a lot of &#34;band width&#34; and that my signal kept dropping to zero and that is why the movie kept buffering and that it was a Comcast problem. She told me different ways to stop the buffering and I corrected the problem the various ways she had told me, but not a one of them worked as a real long term solution. Then she told me I needed to setthe movie to standard. There is no way for me to do this. I click on Amazon Prime and then it gives me the list of movies to choose from and none are in Standard mode. She said I needed to watch it in &#34;standard&#34; instead of HD (I don't pay for, nor have HD on my cable line). She said she placed the movie as &#34;standard&#34; in the &#34;Your Video Library&#34; section and that this would take care of the problem and to watch it out of this section. This did not one thing to help the problem, and the movie still says HD. How can this be Standard?<br /><br />Anyway, the movie went into buffering mode so many times I lost count. I even had Comcast reset my box and send a new signal. It did not matter. Each time I had to exit the movie and it would tell me I had lost my signal but I didn't need to reconnect or refresh at times......it would just go back to having a good signal. The signal was never lost. I could tell that for sure! It took me and my friend &#34;HOURS&#34; to finish watching the movie and I am so disgusted with Amazon Prime and the inability of your reps to correct the problem. They were basically reading from a script of things to try and once they were tried they didn't know what to do. Lori wasn't listening to me and could not seem to grasp what I was telling her. It was a most frustrating experience to say the least!! The whole experience was just plain awful and stressful.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love it!!!!! Keeps getting better and better! I cant get enough of this show! It is definitely a must see!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|very fun. addictive and frustrating. a great game to pass the time. glad it has a time limit, to stop me from staying up all night.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the greatest device since ice cream. Just plug it in, set it up and start watching streaming video.<br />Works great and easy to set up.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I've enjoyed this, but haven't jumped enough into it to say that I love it. It is, though, way better than what came with the Kindle
B00BD99JMW|4.0|First off, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. But if you're anything like me, you will read this especillg because you WANT the spoilers.<br /><br />I've read most of the other reviews here, and the people who've written them are pissed off more than anything. But why? People are saying that Tris died without reason. OF COURSE she had a reason!! This was probably the most selfless fictional death, I'm guessing that Ms. Roth wanted to make it a statement, that Tris was Abnegation AND Dauntless AND Erudite to her dying breath. Trust me, I wanted nothing more than to fling the Kindle across the room and strangle Ms. Roth, but the series was meant to end like that.<br /><br />Maybe the only thing I actually, honestly did not like about this book was the fact that Tobias has gone through way too much in his short life, did Ms. Roth HAVE to add on? Child abuse, his instructor and only friend dying and actually being alive, his guilt towards Zeke, his fights with Tris, his horrible malfunctioning family, did Ms. Roth REALLY have to kill Tris when TOBIAS WASN'T EVEN THERE? I guess I was right, authors can be more cruel than Nazis if they want to.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|this is a lovely film and great quality recording.  we noticed visual details that we never saw before on tv or video tape.  we do not have blue ray on tv so we cant watch the blue ray disc but fortunately they include a regular dvd that is excellent quality.
B004132HZS|5.0|Brilliantly written and acted.  Intelligent, witty, and even believable in many ways.  The whole family enjoys watching the show and we look forward to enjoying the next season as well!
B002JXK5VU|4.0|Eureka is  sort of a Sci-Fi dramedy.  The characters are believable amd stories are somewhat engaging, but there's a lite, borderline comedy feel to it.  Not a life-changing show, but enjoyable nonetheless.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I've never been a big Sherlock Holmes fan...I've read some of the stories, but never really got into it.  Then a friend had me sit down and watch an episode of this series with her.  I've been hooked ever since!  It's now an evening family event to sit down and watch and episode together.  Brilliantly acted and written, it draws you in, makes you think, makes you laugh, and makes you look around the world and pay a little more attention to the details lol.  Can't wait for the next season to be released!
B00425S1H8|5.0|This device installs easily and works great on my Late 2011 Macbook Pro and Late 2012 Macbook Air. No problems. I use Zterm for my emulator. Just remember to select the correct \\"modem\\" under modem settings it will either be usbserial or USB to Serial. It seems to default to the Bluetooth Serial interface if the adapter is not plugged in before you open the app. So far I have used this on HP network switches and Cisco firewall appliances.
B00CFYAT6O|2.0|Very disappointing. I love Susan Tedeschi. Great blues voice. Saw her several times before she and her husband teamed up an I have all her sold albums. But this combination just doesn't do it for me. Derek Trucks is a skilled slid guitarist but his musical sense does nothing for me. The choice of songs are dull. There's a lot of wasted talent here.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great movie. Bought it for my boys to watch on our kindle for vacation. It's a movie our whole family enjoys!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very creative and  gives one the hope in<br />God  that is due to Himi.  We all come to a time when we are torn by the spirits of evil that try to dissolve our<br />Belief in  a life after death. Bravo to this witness to the power of Love.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the read.  Would recommend it to others.  Wasn't aware that Richard Castle was an actual author.  Hope you enjoy the read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|When I played online it was with herobrine and I got of the game quick and he disconnected me and I went back and herobrine took my stuff DO NOT PLAY ONLINE! IT COULD BE HEROBRINE!
0671646788|5.0|Other than the Bible, &#34;The Magic of Thinking Big&#34; changed my life in 1974. I teach this book all over the South. I have given away many copies. I rate it the best. I wish I could have met Dr. David Schwartz. I rate &#34;Thinking Big&#34; a 5 Star.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush saga. Totally addicting. I am so happy they have made available for the kindle fire again. I would recommend this game to anyone. It is very popular. I am sure everyone has a friend that plays this game.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Unfortunately this is a very poor book to end what had been an excellent trilogy of books. Initially, I found it just dull. The chapters were slow and hard to get through because they basically lacked content. Additionally, by a little over half way through the book, we are met with a number of different rebel groups/movements. Some variety in plot would have been nice. Tris's thought patterns lacked their usual depth. In fact, by the just over halfway through the book, I couldn't take anymore and stopped reading it. I found out the ending by reading other reviews which in many cases, were more entertaining than the book itself. This book is a waste of time. It is almost as if the last book were written by a different author.
B001FOPODS|5.0|surprisingly the kids (12, 10 and 8) loved it - weren't afraid of the wolf!!! - and  identified with the music and animal combination.  Very well done.
B000FBJF7I|4.0|Having just returned from Botswana, these books are really fun. Looking forward to reading the whole series. The characters become like friends and you want to know what becomes of them.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Best  game I've played in a longer time.... and I love That I get to play against my freinds!!!<br />BUT I'm having problems connecting with fb...kinda boring playing BUT myself. I guess I will stick to my phone. Until I figure out the problem.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS...<br /><br />I don't frequently write reviews, however after finishing Veronica Roth's Allegiant (which I had eagerly awaited since the day it was announced) I felt compelled to share my disappointment.  Having read several other reviews I'm comforted that I'm not alone in feeling the novel fell flat.  I felt the dual POV intended in the novel completely failed - Tris and Tobias aren't one person, but as the chapters lacked distinctive voices it was impossible to differentiate between characters without checking pronouns.  After waiting from the end of Insurgent for the big \\"reveal\\" behind the Edith Prior video, I was let down by the pace of the book.  I found myself thinking there had to be something more, and then, when Roth could have actually had a major moment she instead chose to make Tris's death... well, frankly boring... our heroine was chucked away in the matter of a paragraph which completely failed to elicit any emotional response.  While I, with many others, feel that Tris's death was utterly unnecessary, I am even more disgruntled by the fact that it was so carelessly presented - If you're going to kill off a main character it should bring tears to my eyes, not make me check the percent bar on the kindle to see how much more mundane plot I need to endure to make it to the end...I really wanted to like this book, but it was impossible to enjoy, and unfortunately mars the trilogy for me.  As much as I love divergent I can't in good faith recommend the trilogy to others knowing that the end fails so completely....
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think thee game is pretty cool .. and you never get tired of it .. I think the creators should make more redeem codes.. other than that... awesome
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books so much that I read them twice.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I have.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book is one of a kind. Real and powerful in a way that few others are, James cuts through the fog of conventional thinking to reveal the essence of human potential. Inspiring !
006202406X|5.0|Roth definitely took risks with the direction of her plot and beloved characters but I was impressed by the twists and turns, especially at the end. She did not take the safe route and I believe that makes Allegiant that much stronger of a book. Emotional, yes. But also layered with hope and redemption in the midst of tragedy and disappointment.
B005PK57IK|5.0|OUTSTANDING writing and acting - the close of the season was very sad.  They have become family.  I wonder how long this series will last as it seems all the ones I like die prematurely.
006202406X|1.0|Ugh. I mostly wish I had just stopped reading this series with Insurgent.<br /><br />I thought I was going to need some time to process my feelings, but I've turned it over in my head all day and I'm not sure anything is going to develop beyond my disappointment. I am so horribly disappointed, and not just in a kneejerk reaction to uh, the thing (you know which thing I'm referring to if you've read it), but in the book as a whole. It just wasn't strong enough to wrap up what was an amazing series up until this last book.<br /><br />The plot fell apart, the continuity was lacking, the perspective switch between Four and Tris was, well, meh. Multiple times I had to flip back to the beginning of a chapter to figure out whose chapter it was, and that says a lot about how indistinct their voices were. I'm also still kind of startled by how many characters strayed so far from who they are without the appropriate character development to make the changes in their character make any sense.<br /><br />I would sort of desperately like to unread Allegiant and leave the ending to this series to my imagination :/
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great writing and acting - seeing the close of the season was very difficult.  They almost become like family.  I don't know how many words are required for this review but it appears that it's more than I give in any real life situation.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I really saw this in a way that was much more relatable to me than the early version.<br />I understood the characters much more. Not only that but the sound track was outstanding.<br />I bought that right after the movie ended.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love the way the lives and stories of characters are inner twined and overlapped in this remarkable and revealing look at life in Afghanistan and how it affected those whose lives began there and ended in places far beyond. This book is classic Hosseini. I don't plan to miss anything he publishes.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|must read if your a Stephen King fan!  Never miss any of his books read this on my Kindle loved it
B000GKW4HG|4.0|This is  a fairly hefty, detailed, and comparatively well made toy.  However we do not know what these creatures actually looked like as far a skin and adornments, and recent books are showing this dinosaur with many color patterns.  In comparison this figure is quite drab and traditional.  But it is clear my son loves this Parasaurolophus figure nonetheless and takes it with him whenever he gets in the car.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|A VERY GOOD READ.  COULDN'T PUT IT  DOWN. I WISH THE AUTHOR WOULD OF EXPLAINED MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO LEE TO CREATE SUCH A MONSTER.  I ALSO THOUGHT THAT STUART EVEN THOUGH I LOVED HIS CHARACTER WAS WHY TO EASY GOING ABOUT CATHERINE'S FEARS.  HE DIDN'T INVESTIGATE OR THINK IT WAS ODD THAT DOORS WERE OPEN.  ALSO WHO WOULD NOT TELL MORE PEOPLE ABOUT A PHYCO SHOWING UP AT YOUR OFFICE OF BUSINESS AFTER WHAT SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH.  BESIDES SOME PARTS THAT DIDN'T QUITE FIT WITH THE REST OF THE THEME IT WAS GOOD.  WOULD RECOMMEND READING IT!
0061906220|5.0|This is the one book my son loved in pre-school.  He would sing along as he tried to read the words.  The images are simple but pleasant, the words are simple but catchy, and the book often kept my son's attention until the end!  This was a hard-cover and son loved it more because of it.  We now have several other Pete-the-Cat books but this one started us out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is so awsome because you swipe and slide and turn and hit minions and get new costumes so awsome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and great, especially when you like minions. It's great for kids and also aldults. SO FUN!
B00340LM8C|3.0|I love movies from the 1950's and 60's but this movie was just too slow.  Typically I love that movies from this time period are not jam packed with special effects, nudity, and graphic language but I could have used a little more \\"something.\\"  I love Grace Kelly and Cary Grant but the chemistry in this movie just wasn't there.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I've been through at least 7 pairs of these. I've just accepted that I have to buy them twice a year.<br /><br />These are the best headphones for working out if the in-ear headphones keep falling out of your weird shaped head. They are lightweight, sweat proof, and take a lot of abuse.<br /><br />However, one side of the earphone always stops working after 5 or so months.  I've tried taking it apart and trying to reconnect the wire but was unsuccessful. Perhaps a greater man could figure it out and post a blog entry.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful and free. There is access to innumerable devotions.The Holy Bible app is very easy to use and I love that you can choose from so many versions of the Bible.
0205313426|5.0|This teaches you how to write in a concise and clear way. You won't sound like a pompous ass if you follow the guidelines in this book.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Yay! So many elements of the book that I missed in the theatrical release are here! (Huorns, the Willow, Treebeard's poetry, and much more)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Definitely read the book before you watch the movie!  It's full of trickery and an underlying story of a country searching for freedom!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|While a few other free alarm apps have easier to use interfaces, this is the only one with full features and doesn't bombard with ads.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing on the computer, then on my phone and was sad to see when I got my Fire that it wasn't available.....now it is!! Super happy.....addicted already lol
1476734941|5.0|Following the two day a week diet has worked miracles for me; I don't really count the calories, but cut way way back for the two days.  Sometimes I put on 2-3 pounds (which I learned can happen overnight from some foods that my body has an issue with, but after one of my diet days, I'm back to my lower weight.  I have lost 12 pounds in a matter of months.
B003M70O5O|2.0|This show makes for good background noise when working on another project.  Who knew biker gangs were so violent.  Ha ha
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I am only half way through it, but not real intrested in finishing it, it wanders too much for my taste. I am glad I have it, but will not recomend it to any, but the diehard Stephen King fans.
0385351399|4.0|When George Orwell wrote \\"1984\\" in 1949, the threat was an all-seeing state with television as the new media to spread its totalitarian message. In Dave Eggers' \\"The Circle\\" the threat is a private corporation, which has gobbled up Google, Facebook, Twitter and several more (perhaps including Amazon), and whose Silicon Valley campus looks a lot like the Googleplex. The Circle's CEO Tom Stenton is seen early on \\"wearing an Italian suit and grinning like the wolf that ate Little Red Riding Hood\\"--an evil version of Larry Ellison perhaps, who has pulled the wool over the eyes of idealistic co-leader Eamon Bailey (Amazon's Jeff Bezos???) and locked founder Ty Gospodinov (Google co-founder Sergei Brin???) in the basement. By the book's end Stenton's goal is clear--to use social media and the mobile internet to control the world.<br /><br />Into this initially sunny campus strolls 24-year old Mae Holland, just two years removed from one of America's elite liberal arts colleges. But to the reader's frustration, Mae just doesn't get it as her privacy and freedom of action are whittled away. Mae is the face of Generation Y--at ease multitasking and zinging her personal likes and dislikes to her millions of faceless followers, but uncomfortable when faced with her parents and ex-boyfriend who still value privacy and freedom.<br /><br />The book is not a page-turner. Sometimes it's painfully slow as we are dragged through Mae's rapid but mindless responses to e-queries and her indecision over how to respond to real people. Nevertheless, an ominous mood builds over the course of the book as Mae loses touch with key players and finally climaxes in an overly symbolic scene in which a shark is released into The Circle's aquarium in front of a global audience. Despite the slow pace, the darkening mood was enough to hold my attention toward an inevitable Completion of the Circle.
B000THCKHU|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums and instantly takes me back to the simpler days of my youth. One Brown Mouse and Weathercock are regular loops through the workday. I really appreciate the acoustic guitar work.
1449305172|5.0|Ash Maurya has taken the classic business model canvas to its next level of usefulness. I work with idea folks all the time - this is a great way to map the ideas to actions.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|This is an insightful documentary.  It does however have a persuasive twist and key information is left out of some of the stories.  Regardless,  I it is an eye opening film that is worth viewing for anyone interested in agriculture, food  processing, and distribution.  Just be intelligent and don't let it be your only source of information.
B009V0TV6O|3.0|When it installs it shows up as the free version of the app.  Not the $1.99 version? What is the difference?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have played on my pc for a long time - so glad that I could load it on my Kindle.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What I like the most about Stephen King is his accurate and detailed descriptions of things, people and organizations.  In this book he paid an incredible tribute to AA and the good work it does.  Hooray, SK!  I enjoy reading him.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good. Easy to access and find the exact place in the Bible. Also very good that you have access to many differnt translations. Can be recommended.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever sat through.  I made myself watch to the end just because I thought something had to happen eventually.  This was slow, boring, and poorly executed.  By far the worst of the series.  Don't waste your time on this dud of a movie.  I can't even express how bad this was.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I cannot stop playing this game! Me and my sister connect all of the time!!! I really think that if you don't have it you should buy it now. GO MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345803485|4.0|this book is an easy read, good price for the trilogy. it is an addicting story line with twists. though i dont think its suitable for all ages naturally.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The second season was great and of course led to the movie. Needed a third season and maybe a fourth.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have always been intrigued with Nazi era - unbelievable anyone could  be so cruel.  Interesting contrasts - young innocence expressing itself through harsh language and criminality - Death fulfilling its purpose yet exhibiting it's softer side.  Found it hard to lay aside, so I read it in just a couple of sessions!  Can't wait to see how the movie portrays it.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I shall be watching this movie again. I hope they continue to a second presentation, left the viewer in the air at the end.
1609611543|5.0|This book has been a real eye opener, the information is verified and seems accurate, and well documented, easy to follow.  Love the almond flour bread!
B005UG542S|5.0|The Harry Potter followers saw the young actors grow up before their eyes. Interesting to see them age at the end of the movie with their own family's
B006LSZECO|5.0|engaging , intellectually stimulating.I couldn't wait to pick up the book and then found it hard to put down...can't wait  for her next book
B0076NAVNA|5.0|Steve Morse, Dave LaRue, Neal Morse, Mike Portnoy, & Casey McPherson, all together in one cohesive, creative, & collaborative group. Say no more: just buy it.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I didn't get to watch the whole thing but I liked the first half well enough to re rent it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this book.  I must read more John green books, I'm hooked. So well written and funny. A absolute masterpiece.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Heard so much negativity in regard to this movie, but I felt that a solid story was told here, with sufficient continuity.  Reality was suspended, and I was entertained.  I liked the \\"fear is a choice\\" lesson, delivered from father to son.  I've wasted 1:45 mins on much worse than this.
006202406X|1.0|I loved Divergent, absolutely loved it. Insurgent was enjoyable but not nearly as good.  As for Allegiant, it was contrived, slow, silly and ended with a shock for no logical reason other than that - shock value.  It felt like a cheap trick just to garner attention for the book.  The dual narration was a complete fail - I sometimes had to go back to the beginning of the Chapter to remind myself who was talking as there was no discernible difference in tone or voice.  The characters' actions were baffling and not remotely consistent with their story arcs or pervious characterizations.  The book was disappointing to say the least.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I can't wait to see the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that Candy Crush is finally available on Kindle.  I enjoy playing the game when waiting at appointments. Thanks Amazon.com
B009SKPVO8|5.0|I have a lightweight DSLR camera and I wanted a way to carry it (not in a case) but traditional around-the-neck straps always give me a neckache. This works amazingly well. I feel it is very secure (I do periodically check the screw connection at the bottom to be sure it is tight ... as I read some reviews that people said it came unscrewed and their camera fell to the ground ... but honestly I have never had it come unscrewed at all ... it is tight every time I check it). It is so comfortable that I take my camera everywhere. My only complaint is that the padded part slips around. It does not stay up on the shoulder at all. But that doesn't bother me.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love Candy Crush but don't like how fast it times out and asks you to pay to continue.  If you don't pay you have to wait anywhere from 5 mins to 30 mins to be able to play again and then the same thing happens again.  Wouldn't mind paying one-fee upfront to just be able to pay it longer each time.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|This kept my kids attention for about 2 minutes. They did not enjoy anything about the app, so it was quickly deleted from our Kindles.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|ORIGINAL REVIEW<br /><br />I feel the dev is trying to slip something by us.  It seems he put up the free version where the paid one was supposed to go.  I wonder if he did that because he doesn't want to give his paid version away at no charge.<br /><br />What is going on with Amazon and their FAOTD?  Not too long ago they gave us a FAOTD that was full of malware and now this.  Also in the last few months they have put up about six titles that had previously been the FAOTD.<br /><br />REVISED REVIEW<br /><br />I was incorrect about it not being the full version.  I tried it out and it was indeed the full one.  It must have been, as someone else pointed out, an error by the dev in not removing the word \\"free\\" from the title.<br /><br />I give a full five stars to the app, along with my apology to the dev.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book, I love the whole series! I wish It did not end I cant wait to see more great books from this author!
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|I am NOT a club music fan in any way, shape or form and the thoughts of Donna's music being 'clubbed' to death sickens me ... Mainly because she had an amazingly wonderful voice,and the original production of her songs was spot on perfection. The original songs had purpose and intent which ignited a firestorm of energy and won her devoted fans throughout the world and across many generations.<br /><br />'Club' music seems to be in itself a one note repeated over and over to nauseated illness, and possesses a looped assault on the mind, leaving the listener begging for real substance. One song sounds just like the last and the one after repeats the first. Can you tell I just do not like club music?<br /><br />This is clearly heard in the god-awful Duke Dumont remix of Dim All The Lights. Donna has been removed vocally except for a few phrases which are again ... repeated to the point of stupidity.  The same can be shouted out about the horrible Benga remix of I Feel Love ... just flat out stupid. One of my favorite phrases is 'Ignorance can be educated, but you just can't fix stupid,' and why these two stupid remixes were chosen to be included in this CD is beyond me because the rest of the songs are actually good.<br /><br />My favorites start with of course, Love To Love You, Baby. Then there's the Afrojack remix of I Feel Love ~ Freakin' awesome (could have gone on for several minutes longer by the way)! The Holy Ghost remix of Working The Midnight Shift was a pleasant surprise. I liked Hot Stuff, and Bad Girls, and even Last Dance which in my opinion should never be messed with, but here it is a new interpretation which actually works rather well.<br /><br />Donna's Husband Bruce Sudano is the executive producer and he deserves a big old high five for bringing his wife's music to the front again, and to a new generation who will no doubt love it as we did the original back in the day.<br /><br />Would I buy this CD again, you're darn tootin' I would because overall, it is actually a good project. I would have liked seeing maybe Spring Affair remixed, or Fairy Tale High, or how about Once Upon A Time? The Wanderer and Supernatural Love would have been good candidates, and Protection would sound amazing with a harder rock edge remix to it.<br /><br />If anyone from the Donna Summer camp is reading this ... maybe a second remix CD? ...  but leave out Duke Dumont and Benga mixers ... not good at  all.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|this is a very good watch for the money,it winds up on its own,no batteries are needed,very good for the money
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the best. I like that it challenges you on records and next level. Plus its free! Assume
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game.  I wish you could get more coins quicker,but it gives me time to finish my work before I start another session. I like it a lot.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be put back on the Kindle Fire for months!!! Bravo Amazon!! Now we need more of the King games..
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is just another variation on the &#34;GEMS&#34; game.  It moves at a very fast pace, so much that I don't know what I am doing to get what I am getting......an the complete a game you are asked to pay an additional $.99 everytime. No thanks!
