B00A3WR5C6|5|Love it. It looks like I had it done professionally. Easy to use. I just need to perfect this art.
B003WR3QSG|3|Well what can I say.. I like this brush and still use it from time to time. As a beginner it was awesome but once you start using other quality brushes you can tell the difference. Now I'm not saying don't buy it but if you have the money I'd find a better brush.
B00GMUY1N4|5|I love Bath and Body's Body Butter and they have discontinued it.  Im buying up all I can find.  Big mistake by Bath and Body discontinuing this product!
B0015KHMRS|5|Good
B000KFZG5E|5|I always use this for deep conditioning, it really repairs color treated/damaged hair well!!
B0001YOBWI|5|I've been wearing DESIGN for many years and it is one of my very favorite fragrances.  Recently, I have been having a harder time getting the body lotion and I don't know why, but I keep trying.  I don't ever want to be without it.  So many people ask me what I'm wearing and really love it as do I.
B001DNE3KQ|5|awesome product
B000050B6U|5|Its good for the money. If you need something cheap that has the quality to do what you need then you should buy this one.
B00GNEIVGW|5|Excellent blades!
B00FEMQUKS|3|I thought this got lost in the mail. But finally I got it and can't wait to try it. Hopeing this shampooh works and to see awesome results
B00NXAICPY|4|very good
B000MIPO0Q|5|This is a great product. Looks nice made well and it makes showering easier. You don't have to look for shampoos or soaps, lotions. You have everything right there on your shower wall. I had one for 7 years the latch broke,I had to get another one.Buy it you will like it.
B006JHDZV4|5|Best brand, got here in great timing and in great condition. All my clients love the look of these over any other synthetic lashes. Very pleased.
B001E7BGXI|5|This cleanser is soap free and fragrance free.  The texture is creamy and does contain an alpha hydroxy acid.  The recommendations to rinse with cold water or use a toner following cleansing is an extra step to make sure the alpha hydroxy acid doesn't aggravate sensitive skin.  I usually use olay regenerist daily cleanser but since this is more of a scrub product, it didn't want to us it daily even though it is o.k. to do so per olay's instructions.  For me this is a good alternative product.
B000R00BQQ|5|I absolutely love all Rexona deodorant sprays. I tried several different scents and loved them all. These deodorants provide an exceptional protection from sweat and fresh scent that lasts all day long. A person can definitely feel confident wearing one of these. No irritation of any kind (even after shaving), stickiness, or residue and yellow stains on the clothing.<br />Downside...If used daily, these deodorants will not last long time as spray will not only go to underarms but also all over the room, and for the price (somewhat high for a deodorant) some may not find it costs effective for a regular every day use. I was going to take the star away because of this, but event with high cost and small size, I still think that these are one of the best deodorants ever made. Too bad they are not available in US stores.<br />I definitely recommend this product.
B005H8PTR4|5|Great deal on time and daughter loves.
B00TGQWFH0|5|I use a sponge for blending and applying my foundation, and normally I use disposables. But going green is a goal of mine, which means fewer disposables and more reusables like this Dream Sponge Makeup Blender. I like the shape, I like the texture, I like the fact that it's washable and reusable. It doesn't soak up a lot of foundation like so many disposable sponges do, yet it blends my foundation perfectly. I definitely recommend it.
B001MV5TU2|5|I have used this brand and color for many years. I have never found a better pressed powder. The color blends well and looks very natural on my skin. It also works well by itself or over a liquid foundation. I wish it had more of the white and grey scales, and less of the darkest tones. However, I truly am impressed with this powder... great coverage.
B0021MFJ38|5|Proactiv always worked great for me. Thank you!
B00FAEOCP0|5|Holy Grail of Mascaras.  Seriously.  I have long lashes already, but this mascara increases the length of my lashes amazingly.  It separates the lashes so they don't look clumped together and you get a beautiful feather effect.  I have long bottom lashes and have ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS, had a problem with using mascara on them as it just seemed to smudge and flake off.  NO MORE.  I'm totally serious - NO MORE SMUDGES, NO MORE FLAKES.  This mascara is easy to remove as well.  It's just perfect, totally perfect.  Buy it, I would be totally surprised if you are disappointed by this mascara.
B00RUR75D6|2|I recently got this pallet and was pleasantly surprised to see the naked 3 pallet. I took a closer look however and noticed that it is fake. the box has no serial number, it is lighter than the real one, it has a flimsy mirror, the brush is lighter, and the colors are not as pigmented. although this would have been cool, it is fake and it is getting exactly what you paid for.
B00022WA9K|5|This is great for my curly frizzy hair.  It dries and calms the frizzies at the same time.
B004H2U610|5|good product.  have been using for long time
B00JS7VO06|4|I like this shampoo because it gives my hair the necessary volume; also like the natural ingredients because they stimulate the scalp.
B001H93WLW|5|Received the pen well packaged and earlier than expected!  It was a Great buy as well!  Thanks!
B0052EOHM6|5|Good deal
B00HIDT94U|5|Quality brushes.  Love them all!
B00KPKIV8I|5|Have Tried several Vc prodoct, skinceutical, philosophy.. all makes my skin red irritated, I guess it is because of the acidity. Only this one is gentle which I can continue using it. Hopfully will have brighter complexion.
B007I6UVSK|4|I did a lot of research before buying these.  I'm glad I did.  This one is a nice, bright red.  Very sexy.  I had a difficult time trying to figure out which size went on which finger, and made a few mistakes, but it didn't take away from the effect.  Many people said they last 2 weeks which was quite appealing.  After one week one of my nails lifted.  That didn't bother me because they fit and stayed on so well.  I'm a nurse so my hands are being washed often and I'm constantly doing things that put pressure on them.  I wash my dishes by hand at least once a day.  They held up really well.  I will buy these again.
B003F2T0M4|4|I was anxious to try this curling iron after reading about it in a magazine. Couldn't find it in local retail/beauty supply stores so went to trusty Amazon and got it. (Now there are several of these on the market, but this was the first out.)<br /><br />Spiral curls that start wider and taper to smaller, like an inverted triangle, are much more flattering than uniform ones, and this curler can create those.<br /><br />I have fine, wavy/curly hair, chin length, and alternate between flat ironing and going 'natural'. I have used 'regular' curling irons with mixed success, because I like the spiral effect and more lift at the scalp, so I thought this cone shape would help accomplish a better look. It works best on me when my hair is not too clean (and has some product in it.) All I have to do is a few strategic sections, and my hair looks wonderful, and I get lots of compliments on it vs when I just 'let it go' and its more frizzy and helter skelter in appearance.<br /><br />It has no clamp, nothing to hold the hair on the surface, you just take a piece of hair and twist it around the barrel, twisting down toward the narrower tip, hold for a few seconds. (It is best to have protective product in your hair).<br /><br />It does heat up quite quickly, as advertised.<br /><br />A minor negative is that the on/off button was placed in a poorly planned position on the wand, and the button is too sensitive, a mere touch and you have shut the thing off mid curl. I have done that several times.<br /><br />It was fairly easy to master on my left side, as I am right handed; when I got to my right side, and have to 'twist' with my non dominant hand -- I am finding it really tricky. Forget about doing the back, that is just too hard. I suggest using a different method for the back, another curling iron or hot curlers, or whatever, if your hair is shorter particularly.<br /><br />It did create a wonderful lift at the scalp and the nice spiral shaped curl I was looking for. I have burned myself twice (they now include a glove, always use it!).<br /><br />Another thing that should have been included was a heatproof sleeve, like my Sedu flat iron has - but I guess they opted not to as I guess this is a lower priced mass market item.<br /><br />Overall I recommend - provided a heatproof glove is used, if you are patient enough to handle the learning curve with using it on your non dominant side. Creates really pretty curls.<br /><br />[...]urned myself twice (they now include a glove, always use it!).<br /><br />Another thing that should have been included was a heatproof sleeve, like my Sedu flat iron has - but I guess they opted not to as I guess this is a lower priced mass market item.<br /><br />Overall I recommend - provided a heatproof glove is used, if you are patient enough to handle the learning curve with using it on your non dominant side.

B00IAQV9RE|3|Very small size.
B003TQU1Q0|5|I have had eczema forever and nothing has reduced the inflammation and calmed my skin like this. In less than a week the cracks, bubbles and redness are on the retreat. Nobody was more surprised that it worked than me.
B000AAAWSU|5|Simply the BEST makeup sponges on the market.  This sponge is big enough and thick enough for easy handling without being chunky.  It is sturdy, surviving repeated hand washing without crumbling, yet its silky smooth texture glides easily over the face.
B00016WW8Q|4|I'm using this as an aftershave alternative and a quick splash of this feels good while simultaneously closing my pores.
B002QFSIW4|5|I was hesitant to buy this, as we all know how horrible sticky, cheap lip glosses can be, but I was pleasantly surprised by this product.<br /><br />The pros: Lots of colors for a good price.  They feel nice and smooth on the lip, and seem to have reasonable staying power.  They also mix fairly well for custom colors.  The palette feels sturdy enough to hold up under all the use it will get.<br /><br />The cons: Not all the colors are useable.  It's possible that there are people out there who want to use bright orange lip color, possibly for a photo shoot or something, but for everyday wearing, several of them are impractical.  However, some of the ones I wouldn't wear alone look really good when mixed with others, which leaves only one or two that I will probably never use.<br /><br />Overall, I feel happy about this buy, especially when buying single lipsticks can be so expensive!
B00NQOZVQK|5|It works well! It even came earlier than expected! Great product.
B004GNMP0U|2|although it came very quick...about 7 of the colors are broken...i don't know who's fault it is...but maybe it should be packaged a little better...  thanks though
B00BXLW9GI|5|I really love this product!  I actually see a difference!It’s improving my skin’s texture without creating blemishes – still a problem at 40-something years of age!
B0002PQ5G6|2|It's lighter and more sheer than I hoped.  Not very pigmented, but sticky.  Only a very tiny amount comes out on the applicator, so after you pump it 5-6 times, you get the amount you need for one lip!  You pay for the brand name ....
B00CXXBHD6|5|I LOVE this product.  It removes make up and residue gently.  I have very dry skin and this product leaves my skin feeling silky and clean.
B002XXAUE8|5|This gift set has it all! everything you need is included. My cousin received this for her birthday and loves it! I cant believe that all of this comes for the price of 1 item from competitors.
B000UK2W4C|1|I have had my Philips Sonicare FlexCare for a little over a year, no problems until this week. It died, no warning, just died. Am now trying to figure out if the 2 year warranty will be honored.
B0041PWEEU|1|I had read good things about this product line so I decided to give this shave cream a try. I usually use MenScience or Lab Series but I thought maybe it was time to try something new. The first thing that struck me when I used this the first time was the scent.  It instantly reminded me of the way Barbasol shaving cream smelled. It has a very light texture and a little goes a long way. But that's about the extent of the positives.  I gave this product two weeks and I am sorry that I gave it so much time.  I always use a mens face wash designed to be used prior to shaving. That, combined with my usual cream usually leave me with little to no razor burn and no red bumps. But after using the Jack Black, it will be a long time before I try a new brand.  I have not had so much razor burn since I was a teenager using the cheap stuff you find at the drug store or supermarket.  So much for the \\"triple cushion\\" effect. In addition, the shave was not very close at all. I was really surprised at just how quickly the 5 o'clock shadow appeared.   And after two weeks, the red bumps on my neck reappeared for the first time in years.  Skip this product.
B00546F4CY|5|Gives my hair a lot of volume.  I have thick hair and sometimes it is too heavy and just lays flat.  This powder gives it some volume and gives the cut some definition... you can see the layers and fullness.  I do really like it.  Amazon has the best price, unless you can buy it at Ulta when it's on sale.  When I need it, it's never on sale so I buy at Amazon.
B002WTC38O|5|I finally spent the money to try Latisse after using Rapidlash successfully for 2 years. I thought it just might produce better results. WRONG! I finished my tiny Latisse bottle, seeing less positive effects and actually losing eyelashes. I promptly ordered 3 more Rapidlash (a deal and no need to order for 6 months) to get my lashes back in order. As an FYI, I'm 62 but still working in retail management and have to keep up with the younger gals, so appearance is important. With age comes less lashes and the sparse areas make me crazy. Rapidlash gave me fullness and length. It's not like when I was in my twenties, but at least I don't have to resort to annoying fake lashes. I haven't found a better product yet.
B008SBIXOI|5|No more stinky feet with this stuff.  I spray it in at night to give it time to dry.  Works great.
B001IKBGEU|5|I am in my 20s, have oily skin and suffer from blackheads/large pores.  I also purchased this product from marshalls, and have only good things to say.  This product has actually cleared up my skin.  It has cleaned out my pores, and absorbs all the excess oils from my pores.  It has apha and beta hydroxys which is what is needed to clean out pores (i have been researching blackheads for years).  It has a pleasant scent; a musky men's cologne fragrance.  I hope this product will become available soon so i can purchase more!
B00CO94DDK|4|I really like this hair oil.  It's light and makes the hair easy to comb through.  I have not noticed any hair growth as of now.  It works very well after washing the hair.  While the hair is damp, just saturate a section of hair at a time and experience easier to manage hair.
B00292BRTU|5|I've yet to use this product as I just came home from work and my fiancé had recieved it for me, but I am very excited to use this. It's a good buy and I definitely recommend it.
B005O1ZGK4|4|Thank you so much, Cindy from Amazon, who sent me this wonderful eyeliner. It's well worth my purchase and it glides on and stays on great, even in this hot, humid weather. :) The brush it came with is so soft and works very well. This eyeliner is also sooooo much better than any pricey eyeliners I've tried in the past like Urban Decay, which just were NOT worth the money at all. I will never have to search for a good brand of eyeliner again.
B008EU9W7K|4|The shampoo is great! I like the conditioner but I am not in love with the leave in styler. I feel like it makes my hair heavy and oily. My hair is too fine for all three products.
B003ATGESA|2|Well, it definitely turned my 6 year olds hair orange for her Halloween costume, but it actually dyed her hair orange too. We've washed it and washed it and I can't get the orange out if her hair. Not her whole head, but the natural blonde streaks she had in her hair are now orange!!! Needless to say I will not be using this again. Oh, I bought the white for my 8 year olds costume and that washed right out of her dark brown hair.
B000ALBLXE|3|Good
B00IJQDZTU|2|i just got mine today, I only got one set, I was expecting two of each mascara. and I didn't im very disappointed, I waited so long because one of the sets was going to be a gift for a friend and that's not going to happen now. what happened? 😟
B000YP8YNQ|5|I bought this kit at a kiosk at my local mall. My hands have NEVER looked and felt better. I am now a fan. One word of advice... Don't automatically pay the price that is quoted by the salesperson. They ARE willing to bargain with you!
B009ZQHIWI|1|Handle is cheap plastic and doesn't have the Dovo logo on it like the picture. Blade holder part was damaged, and the red part that holds the blade stuck and was almost impossible to pull out. It sticks so bad that from using too much force to pull it out (to change the blade), I sliced my thumb and had to get 7 stitches today. Not only was it a complete waste of money, but now I cannot use my right hand for a week.<br /><br />Personally, I think it is a knockoff (thanks Amazon for checking your sellers). If it isn't, it's a piece of crap, and I recommend any other shavette. Absolute disappointment, and I'll probably never purchase anything off Amazon again for the fear of it being fake. Pay an extra $5 and buy it direct from Dovo.
B0013JHGPO|5|Maybe there are other high end base coats that work as well as this one but I can say without hesitation that this product works a hundred times better than anything you'll find in a drug store OR than whatever they use at your average strip mall nail salon.     With this product, it was 5 days before I saw a chip at all and 10 days before my nails got to the point that I felt like I had to take the polish off. When I get my nails done in salons, it typically only takes 2 days for the polish to chip and I'm lucky if I make it a week without having to take it off.    If there is a reason that nail salons don't use 'Stickey Base Coat' it's probably because they know that their customers wouldn't have to come in as often if they did. I would HIGHLY recommend this.
B00T56MBS4|3|I just used this shampoo today and my hair was soft and it smells wonderful.  It's not as good as the original Agree but very close.  My hair smells great!
B0024GT9NC|4|My mom loved using this on her feet.  She was very much a senior with very tired feet. This helped alot. Thank you. Jan Burn
B00M3CAEJK|5|This is the best gift I have ever gotten in my life! I have always has trouble with my crazy, wavy, frizzy hair. I have always hated my hair until I got this product! I have always dreaded going out because I do not know much about how to tame my hair. I am already not photogenic, and having ugly hair just makes things worse. My hair feels wonderful and is so silky. I highly recommend this product for everyone!
B004CHS6UI|5|Great for tatoos, eyebrows and many other creations.
B00JITDVCI|5|Damn fine rechargeable shaver. One charge lasts a VERY long time. Shave is clean, close and fast. No much else to say.
B00CGDWNK4|1|These leggings were sized smaller and no stretch to them, so they didn't fit. They were pretty though, too bad they didnt work for us.
B002V40IS2|4|I love this brush- it is holding up very nicely, lathers up well and feels nice. Great quality and price!
B00AQ23SNI|5|Great smell. Fast shipping
B001390336|4|The product arrived quickly, and appears to be good.  Very good price.  I would probably purchase this again since I like Nioxin products.
B001618JY6|5|I tend to have my hands in water a lot, so I've been plagued with the tips of my nails constantly flaking. I tried all sorts of things: keeping my nails painted made them turn yellow, natural nail strengtheners failed, and I didn't have time to sit and rub moisturizers etc. into my nails for hours at a time.  I eventually remembered Mavala from my teen years, found it on Amazon, and rather dubiously decided to try it again, thinking that it was unlikely to have the same impact on my menopausal nails as it did on my teenage nails. But it worked!  Within a week or two my nails were no longer flaking, they grew out, it was a miracle!  I was planning to get a manicure, but then ... alas, both my thumb nails cracked just where the nail separates from my finger, and I had to cut both nails off, as short as I could.  Weep.<br /><br />Today I learned why, thanks to Lauren from MA (see her November 2012 review) -- too much Mavala ends up making your nails *too* hard, and brittle, and they can break.  So I need to curb my enthusiasm, re-read the instructions, and I'll start again in a few weeks.<br /><br />One other note: It is true that this product contains formaldehyde, that is why it works, but as long as this is the only product I am using that contains it, I'm not worried about it, you use so very little, it's just the tips of the nails every week or two (or less, as I said, I need to re-read the instructions).
B00IIECUV2|5|Despite the smell in the beginning if you air out the brushes the smell goes away. For the price cant beat it.....Does a lovely job!
B003HDEZXU|5|Originally tried this product at an onsen in Japan and was amused by it.<br />Product was being sold at the hotel's shop so I bought it.<br />Liked it so much I searched the web for the product and was happy to find it on Amazon.com.<br />It really leaves your face with a squeaky clean feeling.
B00CHMWAY8|5|Save my skin in Pittsburgh's winter. I love this.
B00PVWRLO0|5|Precise and well-made.  Comes in a handy pouch for storage.
B0088B6YPI|5|Best comb for product distribution, detangling without pulling and breaking off the hair!<br />It does all my hair care with great results, I am so impressed, and I do have all sorts of combs.<br />I have very Fine hair and have to look for the right shampoos, hair products etc., and --the Right comb!<br />Once I tried it, I was in Love!  :)
B00ATA8BX4|5|I was 'iffy' about this product in the beginning.  What was good was also bad: high density pigment made it difficult to remove and I like makeup that washes off in the shower instead of requiring a ton of make up remover.  I changed from black to brown and that made all the difference.  Now I'm prefer this one to the previous version.  It does stay on all day without needing any touch up.
B007UZ4FMW|5|Goes on easy.  Does not seem to irritate my eyes, or harm lashes at night.  I prefer natural mascara s.  I would buy again.
B0037LOQQI|1|After years of use, suddenly each time I use this product I get a rash with itch. Until now I have adored the product using it faithfully in my many hours in the sun.<br /><br />Either the formula has changed or I am being sold a counterfeit product. I give this a one-star rating to warn folks.<br /><br />I stopped using this sunscreen now twice, using other products for at least a month. Twice I have returned to Neutrogena's 110 SPF, both times with a rash occurring within a few hours' time.
B002RBF1PO|5|This was my first de razer and it has been a very forgiving razor for a rookie like me.  Its very easy to learn with and to use on a daily basis.
B00GI9GTK2|4|Love it!
B005IC7Q3E|5|Love love love this product...many compliments
B00FU5FV0E|1|The product may have been new meaning it has never been opened but the product appeared old. The lotion smelled the same but it was yellow in color and didn't feel as creamy as it should.<br />Possibly due to being old or poor storage. ???<br />I will definitely NOT purchase from this seller again.
B00521MSJS|1|the lashes are plastic and heavy. They are very stiff and I hate it. I am sorry I bought it and I wont buy it again.
B004AI565W|5|I love panoxyl soap , because it works for my sensitive skin.
B003WN1ELQ|5|I've used it every morning for a couple of years on my neck and upper chest. I've used makeup with a high SPF on my face since they began making it, and sunscreen underneath my makeup prior to that. Most people say I look 15-20 years younger than my age.<br />I also use CeraVe PM. I love these products!
B0063KIQBG|5|These headbands are just what I need for thr summer. Keep the hair up and off the neck. They're perfect.
B00HS964GU|1|Ordered dark brown but got black. Return shipping more than item.
B00BT9S10W|4|Awesome! Last so long, i buy these over and over. Only thing that sucks, is the grams.
B00BC3GVCA|2|had to put on several coats !
B00C0OC77S|5|Exactly what it was represented to be, this EO carrying case is just what I need to carry my most favorite oils when I travel.  It is the perfect size for 5 bottles and will accommodate a roller bottle or 2 also.  It is nicely padded so that the oils are protected and zips securely.  I am so pleased with it that I will buy one for my daughter.  Great product; I highly recommend.
B00BPDUHI6|5|Love the product will definitely buy from this vendor again!
B001EWEP36|1|I have used the Mitchum brand since 1983, after I moved to the Eastern U.S. and found out how useless most deodorants are in high-humidity conditions. Mitchum was the only product I found that worked.    It is regrettable that Mitchum chose to change the active ingredient. Perhaps they changed it several times since 1983, but the most recent change came to my attention when a new container left my armpits raw after 2 or 3 uses.    I hadn't thrown the old container out, so I compared labels. I can do so again now for you because I have hung onto that old container, as well as the unusable newer one. Whence,  OLD ACTIVE INGREDIENT:  Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 20%  NEW ACTIVE INGREDIENT:  Aluminum Sesquichlorohydrate 25%    Now I am unable to use either the roll-on or gel Mitchum products.  Thanks, Mitchum, for taking a perfect product and ruining it.
B0010P55I6|1|This product is a favorite of mine, but this is a trial size being sold as full size.
B00742JW8S|5|i love this epilator. it takes very little time to take away all of the hair and doesnt hurt terribly. bikini line is a bit sore and so are arm pits but deffinitely worth the results :)
B0017TOHFW|2|I use several TIGI products that I love.  This one I was not impressed with.  It was too heavy to suite me and I did not notice any improvement in shine.  I wouldn't recommend this product.
B00C7DYBX0|5|I'm in the sixth month of using this and I am on the second bottle.  I am 69 years ald so the wrinkles were set in places I hated.........around my mouth, furrows in the brows etc.  I am seeing a change but it is very subtle and gradual.  I believe I look about 8 years younger already and I have had many compliments on my skin this summer.  I use it in conjunction with the honey moisturizer suggested. (Era Organics Moisturizer).  I use these at night after I have cleansed my face with cold cream and a steamy cloth.  Be patient, however, it doesn't happen over night. Many of my friends have noticed a difference and started using these products.
B009V87LUE|5|Love it!!!
B00K6PBJ9A|5|100% good
B0055DZ4NK|5|You will love this spray. Just a few spritzes and the kids are in heaven when you brush their hair after bath.
B0009DSQOA|5|I love this sunscreen! I started using MD Forte after a dermatologist recommended it to me. I have some small patches of melasma, or skin darkening, so I am very careful to keep 'screened' in the sun.     I wear this everyday as a moisturizer and sunscreen. I've tried many comparable products, and find they can be either greasy or drying, but this is the best I've tried, and worth the price.
B0085YC07O|5|I've been using Argan oil for a few months now and I'm very happy with this purchase. I like the fact that it is a drop counter as I like to add a few drops to my face moisturizer easily. I will purchase again.
B005UL1B34|5|I was simply amazed when I received this. I knew it was going to have plenty of colors, but each pallet I opened, I was more amazed. It looks like there are duplicate colors, but each pallet is a different shade: glitter, matte, shiny. I love Shany products and have bought this collection as well as several other products. The colors are vibrant and the shadows go on great without having to use a ton to stand out. Great buy for the price!
B008XM2K6Y|5|Hey , I STILL HAVE HAIR , COOL .
B001FB5HZG|5|Love this stuff! I keep a bottle in the shower and use it every morning.  It's not a harsh cleanser but keeps my face clean of blackheads, especially in the t-zone area.   I keep a bottle of the creamy cleanser by my sink and use it at night to wash off my makeup.
B002FDKE92|5|Love this scrub. Fine particles really do a great job of smoothing dry skin away. I have been using this for 3 years now and combined with the other Hyalogic products it works great.
B003XU8AMY|1|I've had this trimmer for just over a year.  It was ok for that time period.  Tonight, it literally fell apart!  I was trying to clean it by lightly tapping it on the sink.  When I say lightly, I mean lightly.  This &#34;groomer&#34; broke literally into five pieces.  I tried to put the pieces back together but because of how small they (the pieces) are, I was unable to put it back together. The return policy only lasts for a month or two.  My &#34;groomer&#34; is trash so do yourself a favor and buy something else.
B001SACYSC|5|So much money can be wasted on drugstore cosmetics.  The color that appears on the end of the tube is not necessarily what you get.  With Lancome you actually do get what you see and it is a quality product.  I live fifty miles from a department store carrying Lancome, so I'm thankful I can order it through Amazon and get exactly what I want.
B005REGSBO|4|I needed something to reduce the appearance of veins and this product seems to help. I only use no more than a dime-size of the product.
B009FKNGIO|4|I'm white... as in my mama has red hair and I inherited her fair skin tone. I usually go with higher SPF, but I wanted to try 30 again. I was surprised at how smooth it went one and how long it lasted. I did reapply frequently, because I'm super cautious about burns, but it did the trick and worked well for my kids too.
B003QYFVRY|5|Our family dentist recommended these.  The kids love and use them.  Beats a manual toothbrush and reaches those hard to reach places.  Offers a thorough cleaning! Your gums will thank you.
B008JPWHHW|1|Ribbon falls off
B009X0J8TC|1|I thought the mask itself was silk.  Guess I got suckered into the &#34;silk filled&#34; part.  A piece of junk--I gave it away.
B00005A441|4|This set warms up fast and produces wonderful full curls.  The downside is the center four curlers are hard to remove and replace with one hand.  It is recommended to remove a curler before trying to hold hair and then extract the curler.  I may have a somewhat defective model since no mention of this can be found in any other review.  It is more of an annoyance that anything else, but I felt it deserved mentioning.
B00TWRV05Q|5|we are of low economic resources and we could not afford a sirugia after I suffered a minor burn on one leg , just out of curiosity decided to try this product and has achieved incredible changes certainly recommend
B00RC5A7MW|4|Great for soap making addition
B008L0AH4U|5|I am an esthetician and waxer for European Wax Center. We are known to have the most gentle wax on the market. I  am moving out of state where there is no EWC and I was researching hard waxes so I can continue to wax myself when a co worker told me about this wax. I must say this is the most comparable to EWC wax I have ever used. For those who are having issues with it make sure that the temperature is cool enough before applying to your skin. The trick is to put a ball of wax on your stick and hold it up for 5 seconds. If the wax starts to drop toward the floor within that 5 seconds then it's too hot. It being too hot is what is going to cause your strips to break. Also, if your hair is thicker then you need to apply a thicker strip. With using this wax I've had no issues whatsoever and happy I've found something to be able to continue waxing with.
B001B7GJ2E|5|Does its intended job.
B0031RTWEO|5|i ordered this for my dad's Christmas gift. i'm pretty sure he'll love it! this is my 2nd time to order brut at Amazon.com
B0002W09TI|3|These lashes are ok. Nothing to brag about. But u can save ur money on shipping if u just print out a coupon from the computer or wait till your local store has them on sale and purchase a bundle at that time
B00176B8BG|5|If you want beautiful soft curls you need this curling iron.  Hot Tools is a great brand and his curling iron will last long beyond cheaper brands.
B00HZEEOTC|5|perfect
B008B9GNXK|2|I am on blood thinners and have to adopt electric shaving. I had a buddy recommend this razor. Didn't work for me at all. It does seem like a quality product, but it was difficult to clean, didn't shave closely at all, and also irritated my skin and left me with red blotches. I wanted to like it and gave it the 3 weeks Norelco suggests it requires to get used to an electric. Anyway this one is getting returned and I'll try a Braun.
B00ID43NJ0|3|The brushes aren't too strong, some of them have a couple of hairs falling out. But it works for something that's so cheap! Their really cute
B00394DTE8|2|Yes, they are razors, and they do work. But not very well... I'm used to using higher end shave tech, but my grandma will occasionally buy me something. So I gave them a go, because I don't want to waste my grandmother's money. The blade held hair far too easily and was difficult to clean, I was shaving a good 3 weeks worth of beard, so that's expected. The shave wasn't even remotely close, it did give the appearance that it was mostly gone. Overall, it was uncomfortable and dragged a lot. I found myself constantly going over an area 2-3 times just to make sure that I was removing the hair properly. I used to use razors like this in middle school when I started shaving, honestly that's about who these should be for. This product left me disappointed and with irritated skin.
B002OD13MU|5|The wig came just as shown.  It is of very good quality.  We use it for role playing during sex and it works great.  Bangs need to be trimmed on wearer however
B00EP4H8UM|5|I frequently look for new ways to curl my hair and following several failure purchases in the past few years, I was delighted to be thrilled with these!!!!  My hair is heavy and straight, it's difficult to add volume and curl rarely stays long, even with a LOT of hair spray.<br /><br />These gave me light, fun, bouncy curls!!  As well as, a good deal of volume!  I used very little hair spray, trying the first time while hanging out at home, and to my surprise, I still had fantastic curl at the end of the day.  I am so happy with these!
B0054ESCB6|4|Powerful scent, lathers great, and rinses off very clean. Leaves my skin hydrated and smooth. This soap doesn't dry out my skin and I can use it throughout the winter unlike most other soaps. The one thing I don't like about Irish Spring soap is that it doesn't work great in the very sensitive areas. I reach for a different soap for my personal needs. Otherwise, I like to keep Irish Spring soap on hand.
B004HQFS96|5|To begin with I don't like perfumes most of them are to strong and overbearing for me, I usually use a peach spray or \\"Loves Baby Soft\\" (which I also love and I have used since I was a teenager), but this Jordin Sparks perfume has a light beautiful scent that I have just fell in love with, I have had strangers come up to me on the subway to ask what scent I was wearing. I would recommend this to everyone, Personally I'm suprised it does not cost more.
B00ODIKJCY|5|Love this! I have everything I need inside this amazing case.
B005LZT9EM|5|My skin cleared up quickly after using this product.
B0032FAYLA|5|This thing works very well.  I would highly recommend it.  What else can you say about a nail file?
B000056W74|5|Estoy enamorada de este aceite, yo lo uso mezclado con mis cremas corporales y la piel me queda de maravilla! Excelente!
B001MA0QY2|5|I got an amazing haircut and the stylist used a flat-iron on my hair, which elicited many compliments. I usually curled my hair, and it was getting too long to do that, so I asked for a new style. Once I realized that I was going to have to use a flat iron, I researched and found the HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic straightener. It had all the elements I read were necessary: ceramic plates, adjustable heat settings, a rotating cord, and what I especially loved, a heat glove. I had never heard of a heat glove before I started researching flat irons and I was happy that the iron came both with a heat glove and the Argan Oil that gives hair a brilliant shine. I love packaging and the carrying pouch. I can't make the cord fit in the pouch, but that is fine, as long as the iron is protected. Using the flat iron is surprisingly simple, and I did not encounter any snagging. I really recommend this product and I love that way my hair came out - silky straight with lots of movement, just like in the salon. I received so many compliments on my hair after using it. I am sure the average user will find this product more than adequate for their needs.
B00BV90WPC|5|Great coverage from this product and it lasts all day. Perfect finish, not dry nor is it greasy or shiny...you get a fresh finish that doesn't quit.
B00H2YL8W6|4|Great set for the price. Also easy to clean!
B000KONYJK|5|You don't have to spend a fortune for a good face cream. I ordered it again because I was pleased with the way my skin looks. I can certainly see a difference in the fine lines. I have tried a number of high end creams that promise miraculous results, but they didn't work as well as Revitalift.
B0000A1WGK|5|About two years ago I got a straightener by Conair almost exactly like this one. Over the past two years I've used it 2-4 times a week and it's never failed me. I have VERY thick hair and the size is perfect. I always put it on the highest settings but I've never burned my hair or myself. Rarely it frizzes, usually leaving my hair soft and smooth. I'm getting a new straightener only because I need one that works wet and dry, although I'll continue to use this one if it's needed. This is a great straightener for all hair types and great if you have thick hair.
B00EKQLNQK|5|After shaving frequently for the past 3 years I have been in the search for an electric razor that doesn't give me razor burn. After having problems with other electric shavers i was given the zr1370. After using it everyday for the past week I couldn't find a complaint. Minute timer is a great feature.
B005MSFVVI|4|Some of the appliqués are kind of tacky but over all they are functional. It took awhile to receive these and they weren't packaged very well. Over all it's kind of hit or miss....but again functional for what is sent.
B000C1UFCA|5|Nice, very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!
B00CHVX10Q|5|MUY BUENO HAIR!!!
B0056Z29GW|5|Bought this for my mom and aunt. They LOVE this fragrance!
B001RVG0MS|5|I used this product when I lived in Puerto Rico it always kept me feeling and smelling fresh and clean. I tried using Jean Nate at first but that fragrance wasn't to  my liking. When I used this (some friends recommended it) it was perfect! Refreshing, citrusy I loved it at first splash! They say that your sense of smell is your strongest memory producing sense and I absolutely believe it. This fragrance brings back memories of sunny beaches, the island breezes and it just takes me back. If you've tried other after shower splashes and haven't tried this product, you are in for a treat.
B00012FJ9E|5|I use this to clean my gas permeable contacts and it does the job great.  I don't use it for storage.
B00O8RXRD8|5|Very soft, easy to wear and shipping was quick. Thank you!
B00CA6XY14|5|This is better for my dry hair , if your hair is dry use it, is worth what you paid for .
B00A7X28TQ|5|The best nail strengthener I've ever used!! My nails would break so easily, so I would have to keep them trimmed really short.<br /><br />I wanted a little more length so I decided to try this. I picked mine up at a local store. I absolutely love it!! My nails are soooooooo strong now. And I have the length I want because my nails aren't breaking now!  I noticed a big difference after a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone with weak nail issues. This can be worn alone or under polish.
B001V9HVME|3|I bought this to get the heavy callouses off my feet. It  will take off a lot of dead skin but if you have heavy  built up callouses it does nothing. Salt or sugar and olive oil will accomplish the same thing and moisturize at the same time. I thought it was very expensive for what it is. I won't buy any more.
B0052GWLF4|5|I was skeptical to try this system but was so excited to get 7 shades improvement in my teeth! My husband even commented how white my teeth looked ! Very excited!
B009U9JUK8|5|I've tried a number of organic shea butters, and so far I am happiest with this.  It seems to me that the unrefined butter is best for your skin; however, if you strongly dislike the smell of shea, go ahead and purchase refined.  Melting this shea and adding a small amount of liquid oils makes for a nice, smooth cream.  The key to not getting gritty cream is to put sealed jars in your refrigerator, or preferrably freezer, as soon as they are full.  Rapid cooling keeps the unrefined shea smoother than it would otherwise be.  Everyone loves the butters I have made with this shea.
B00IBCM4RQ|5|Very good. Love it
B0081EY9MC|5|Great set of brushes. Arrived on time and we'll made!
B00K0R8NWK|4|My daughter has straight hair that tangles easily, especially overnight. This brush was a lifesaver.
B00F4SJ4IC|5|These are AMAZING
B0094DH1RE|5|Exactly what I ordered. Loved them.
B0045OR410|5|So glad I discovered these products.  My curly hair was driving me crazy until I found these.  Absolutely recommend and this size lasts a very long time.
B000ALDK1A|5|Was recently suggested by my radiologist to use this gel two times a day on the skin where I am getting radiation. It works well and keeps the skin smooth inspite of radiation effeects. I got this at my hospital pharmacy and the price was slightly cheaper. I plan to use them in my hand and knees where I see a lot of dry skin due to chemo effect.
B00F4VXUF2|5|When i first got it i was like &#34;oh no&#34; im just a little bit browner than this product. i was wrong. it is my exact shade. thank you l'oreal. i love it.
B000FS05VG|1|I purchased this hair dryer a little over 3 months ago and the heating element is already broken. It only blows cold air regardless of the heat setting that it is on. I purchased this hair dryer based on the positive reviews that it had received, and I am very disappointed. I will not be purchasing a Revlon hair dryer again. I have an old Conair hair dryer that I have had for almost 10 years that still works like a charm.
B00S6FJ5IO|5|Should be a great surprise.
B002WMOMKS|2|I agree that the scent is very nice albeit super-strong.  However it feels both dry (as in: \\"not moisturizing\\") and greasy (as in: smeary and slippery) at the same time.  After the greasiness has worn off my skin feels just as dry as before I put it on.  I love this brand of soap, but I've tried two of their lotions and don't like either of them.  And the scent is lovely; like a previous reviewer, it reminds me of something from childhood.  But my eyes begin to water, I begin to sneeze, and my skin burns and reddens as soon as I apply.  Too bad; otherwise I adore this company.
B001236DFU|5|Just enough tint for a healthy glow. Does not dry my skin. Feels soft and silky. And a generous amount for the price. Love this product.
B000LNB8HK|5|I purchased this to go aling with the Andis clippers and it works great!  After a little bit of grooming I spray some on the clippers and it seems to keep my dog satisfied until I can get finished and she doesn't seem to matter as much. Would recommend.
B002HEW7Z8|4|The 14K Gold works better.
B001RYORM0|5|Since Clairol discontinued \\"Loving Care\\" in the U.S., I have to buy it from the UK.  The box is a little different, but it is the same stuff - called Nice N Easy Loving Care.  Yay!  I'm allergic to everything else!
B0046KGAR2|5|These products are making my hair soft, silky and shiny.  Will definitely buy again.  The best I've ever used.
7533258851|3|Well,did nothing for me .
B00EOXAEDW|4|As many of the other reviewers stated I also got a sample from Tarte cosmetic line of a product that had this in it and it was fabulous. As most others as well, wanted to get it for less, so came to Amazon to see what was out there. While this does feel very similar to the Tarte product, I do find the scent off-putting. It just smells like oil, which it is, I am just having a bit of an issue with it. I have ordered another brand off Amazon that says it's refined one more step to remove fragrance and will review that when I have used it a while. At this point I am mixing it with other essential oils trying to come up with my own face oil to help combat my just turned 50 skin. I have also ordered Evening Primrose oil which is one of the better for helping with skin elasticity.
B00TEAJB70|1|Not impressed, have not seen any changes
B00P8CQK90|5|This oil is high quality; I love it as a carrier oil for my Essential oils as well as all by itself as a body lotion. Great stuff with so many uses!!
B000WZRCM2|5|I normally wear Design by P.S. and have done so for years, trying such scents as Coco, Juicy, some Estee Lauder, and even Coach.  I liked them all, and they were my occasional departure from my daily \\"Design\\" reassurance, until Sean John came into my life just recently.    I sprayed it on and went out of the house for errands.  All day long, I smelled this earthy yet exotic scent....I wondered what store I had gone into with such a delicious scent lingering on me.  It reminds me of a mix between patchouli, trips to candle factories, steamy nights and cabarets.  I literally kept smelling the air, and was even more overjoyed when the pashmina I had worn that day still smelled so exotic from Unforgivable the very next morning.      I have switched my daily reliable Design to Unforgivable.  I have gone from good girl nice to secretly naughty just by wearing this heady mix of earth and fire.  What an amazing difference the scent makes when I'm in a mundane meeting or shopping for milk and bread!  It's definitely not for someone who doesn't believe that sometimes being a bad girl makes for a very good time.....Get as a gift for your wife or lady friend if she still has the passion for adventure in her soul!  Or, if you're bored and can't afford Cancun, indulge yourself in this delicious sinful bottle.
B001AHC64A|5|I use this cream and is very good for me. To see any change we have to use all the time.
B00CGWF5UA|5|WHEN IT COMES TO SCENTS I'M VERY PICKY. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENTS. GOOD BUY. FAST SHIPPING. IF. YOU LIKE AXE TRY KILO YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B000O5WGHG|5|I have used this product successfully for some time, which is why I keep purchasing it.
B004Y9M36M|5|L'OREAL PARIS MAKEUP SMOOTHING BEIGE IS WONDERFUL. i'M 66 AND HAD TI WORK WITH THE BRUSH FOR A SHORT TIME. L0VE IT.
B00150JU4G|5|Very good brand. Be sure to find the right product for different types of skins.
B00JZFB13G|1|Not what i expected. Soooo small and hard
B000BK1P9E|5|I have the thinnest hair I know of and this is the only leave in I can use. I also have highlighted hair, using bleach, so this brings back the softness my hair looses from this processing. I wouldn't go a day without it. Can't find it in the huge size anymore, though. :(
B000IF5CC8|5|this is the perfect size for the in between curls, also easy to use, flexible temperatures, and great cover for travel and storage so I don't scratch the barrel.
B00EDZD2ZS|5|Loved it
B002C1JEPM|5|I uesed to ues skin79 super plus BB cream but this time I want to have a try on this one(supler plus is not bad though). The flavor is sweeter and the cream is not dry and easy to apply. I like it. But the Lip & cheek tint is just so so, at least for lips it's not so good. But OK for cheeks. I love the tiny mirror inside :)
B003DQOQO4|5|This is a great product.  I used it this summer when I wore skirts to avoid chafed skin and it works great.  It doesn't have much fragrance, it's not greasy and lasts for several hours.  I highly recommend it!
B00I3OMMCO|5|Smells great! My husband loves it! Super quick shipping.... happy campers over here!
B00DQUVXPW|5|I was skeptical when I bought this and I had no idea if I had purchased the correct shade of blonde. My hair is highlighted. I would say it's mostly light blonde and dark blonde at the roots and in the back. I ordered the light blonde (based on other reviews) and it's a pretty darn good match. I bought it to cover my gray in between color appointments and it works like a charm. The brush is a piece of junk (bristles fall out like crazy) but the product really covers gray and stays on until you wash it out. Try it!
B000OBFYTC|5|These flossers are the only ones that I know of that get all the goop off of your teeth and squeak afterwards letting you know that the tooth is clean.  I told this to my dentist and he thought I sounded like an old tv soap commercial, but these are the best!  Watch out for the point though, they would probably make a great weapon.
B0007CXY2C|5|Great product...can't go wrong with Paul Mitchell...
B002SVN5SS|5|good every day make up I am acne prone.. does not make me brake out..
B002PR2GLM|5|My hair is dry, wavy and frizzy. The 1st oil i tried was by Killer Strands.  It smelled great & was great for my hair, but made my hair smelled like rancid cooking oil.  I couldn't handle it!  One &only Argan is the oil i'm sticking with.  It's light, smells good, and never makes my hair smell bad.  It makes my hair shiny and increases the elasticity, making my curls more defined. What a great price too!  WAY cheaper than the other oil i tried and, for me, a better product.    Usage: Once a day, I dispense 2-3 drops in my palm, rub between hands, and \\"scrunch\\" into my hair (after drying), especially the ends.
B000P22TIY|5|For me was awesome, useful and easy to use.... I get quickly after I made my order. Just buy it if u need it
B000068PBT|4|They worked as well as expected.
B00GLD6MTI|5|E͓̽x͓̽c͓̽e͓̽l͓̽l͓̽e͓̽n͓̽t͓̽
B004HRB0CE|5|Not as pink as appeared in the picture--more of an earthy peach-- still love it though!
B00EOXX5YM|5|Best
B0000536P3|5|Great moisturizer!!  Very light but does the job!!
B00FH3YARY|4|I like it but it does not last 48 hours, on hot days I have to reapply a few times a day.
B001KBYDFQ|3|you cant give this as a gift  because it does not come with a top   and it comes with  a big old  sticker that says tester  on it  so had to get another gift
B00N596QKG|1|I purchased this to use with the Red by Kiss 2200 Ceramic Dryer. The styling pik will not stay on the dryer. It doesn't appear to be broken, it's just too big. This was a waste of money for me.
B000KGVMHY|5|excelente
B00GNA9WG4|5|WONDERFUL brush for 4a hair, detangling made easier and faster! Best brush ever.....telling all my curl friends.
B0024921IY|5|This product made a miracle in my hair! It's perfct, my hair is gorgeous now! It's easy and quick to apply.
B00JH2SFBS|5|Love this eye cream, very soothing!
B00A6H2DD4|1|Useless. This did not help my blackheads in the least little bit.
B00O521N78|5|Great as pic... Very happy
B005QAFTY6|5|I really hated the smell of after tanning and had to try this &#34;fragrance free&#34; lotion.<br />SO glad that I tried!!! LOVE it!<br />Someone said it's light scent but to me, it's really fragrance free as advertised and I can't smell anything.<br />If you hate the smell of after tanning, you have to try this!!!
B001ORXXYI|5|Since I rarely use cosmetics, I ordered this for my wife. I have not used it myself, but she says it is really wonderful.
B000TCD51A|5|Great product!!! Nothing but taste!!!!
B00GY5F1NG|5|perfect
B00BXDPF9Y|5|Im giving this 5 stars because it was an awesome buy. Now, if I could rate more than once then I would give it 3 stars because the strips do not come off clean. Causing polish to come up with the strips sometimes. Also, the quality of the bristles are rather cheapish.
B001KYUHGM|5|I really love this thing, is so soft, creamy, love the smell, has the perfect amount of shine, im buying it again!
B00E94ZBPC|1|Broke in the first wearing.. Don't buy
B000K10V2Q|5|I bought these for my mom because she has a hard time getting the key to turn in the door.  She'd loved them and they are easy for her to use.  Actually others in my family have really liked them as well and everyone's ask where I purchased them because they want some too!  Great tool!
B0086VI9TE|1|I recognized the flimsy cardboard packaging right away, this is commonly how the counterfeit product packages look from China, where I have lived. Words on brushhead blurry as another commenter mentioned. Internal metal seems cheaper.<br />DO NOT BUY THESE. Not work few bucks you save from real thing at local store!!
B00942W51C|3|It ain't all that. The way people on YouTube try to make it seem like. I do like<br />It though
B007AMOA8Y|5|This item works fantastic on burns. Got a motorcycle pipe burn and you can barely see the spot. I immediately iced spit to get rid of the heat and used this 4 times a day.
B000HJZS10|5|A Great, Great product. I think it is a better cleanser than any other product I've used in the past. I really like how it leaves my skin feeling afterwards, and it smells good too.
B0043OYFKU|5|Love this  face cleansing brush! Has msde a noticable difference in my skin.
B00HQW86WY|5|Makes my colored-treated and highlighted hair feel like silk! It's a bonus that these products are organic and smell amazing too.
B003YJAZZ4|5|About 5 years ago I upgraded from a Braun 5 series to a Braun 7 series.  The pulsonic microvibrations seemed like overkill at the time but I got used to them after about a week.  Two weeks ago I needed to replace my 7 series and went back to a 5 series (565) because of price.  Boy did I miss the microvibrations then!  The 565 acted like its battery was dying when it is put under the load of my one-day-old whiskers.  I had to move the shaver so slowly across my face or it felt like it was pulling the hair rather than shaving.  I ended up with a very close shave which made me happy but at almost 3X the length of time as my 7 series.  I was able to return it and purchased this series 7 and have been very happy with it.  This is what I expect from a quality Braun shaver and it did not disappoint.
B008I0OXR0|5|This wig is very full, long and beautiful! I've been using for cosplay for 6 months now and it still looks very nice.<br />I'm 5&#34;6 and it reaches my bellybutton. It has gotten a bit tangly but that's to be expected with a curly wig. I also really like the bangs!<br />I've been using it for my Aradia Megido and Jade Harley cosplays and it works very well for both c:
B004XJRVHY|5|Love this one, so I bought a 1 oz bottle at Walmart it was $25.00. This was $27.00 for 3 and a half times more product! Super deal for a super product
B0017QK8IU|5|this is the best scent of Jason hand soap, any hand soap for that matter.  Less drying than most hand soaps.  Expensive, but love it.
B001B4F75W|5|As expected
B00KJKHBRQ|5|This tool really does minimize lines on your face. I use it around my eyes and mouth and I can really see a difference
B0085Y98VA|5|Loooove! Perfect palette, unique colors & great pigmentation! Came perfectly intact & I love using it, hasn't let me down one bit :)
B00DCF7QW0|5|Very good product and arrived on time. Will definitely be ordering more in the future.
B003PLFJBQ|5|I'm a 26 year old men and I bought to help me with my oily skin and it works wonders and I got it for $9 which is a great price!
B005XIM6J2|5|These work wonderfully as eyeshadow/eyeliners blenders (especially underneath eyes).<br /><br />Also to clean crevices, and to neaten the cuticle area (when applying toenail/fingernail polish).<br /><br />Very difficult to find locally.
B0049MCVIY|5|Great product. Great shipper. Super satisfied With color payOff and quality of product. Lots Of colors to choose from. Having fun using them all.
B00356UHT0|4|Covers my flaws but a bit too white. I have oily skin so this didn't prevent that, but with my foundation powder it's fine.
B0002AHY6Q|1|Seeing that their are only two companies making small waterpiks  that can be easily transported in a carryon, this company has a  near monopoly on this garbage product. You will get at best 1-3   years until you have to buy a new one. Waterpik is smart enough   in their construction to rip off the consumer. They make it so you  can't replace the battery, and they do not make a small Waterpik  that is electric. If they did guess what... planned obsolescence   would not help their gross margins like this complete tool does  based on the highest profit margin possible for throwaway consumer   items.
B001JQLNH8|5|Won't shave with anything else and great value!  Gillette should have stopped at Mach 3 - this is the perfect razor
B005C4WPIY|2|Im sure its good for others but this product did not work for me. I started to wet shave with a de razor and bought proraso products after no luck with this. Wayyy better than anything ive ever used.
B00KVXSEGS|2|Not at all as thin as it looks.... that's what I get for online shopping for a brow brush I have enough of these kind..... what I wanted was a super thin brush for the end of my brows and this one is so not it..... if you need a filler here you go but a liner brush not at all nor good for super thing ends......
B008RT3FZI|5|I really love these lashes. I got them randomly because I was looking for something cheap and cute for a dolly eye look and these are super perfect for the look I'm trying to achieve. I get compliments on them a lot; they really open up my eyes and make them look big and bright!<br /><br />http://36.media.tumblr.com/31a88952040cec27f8aef5d9aa1f7d15/tumblr_nj67toQQqK1sjam19o1_500.png<br />http://41.media.tumblr.com/a02d60c4d5ad52d4ca8729d85a8ce892/tumblr_nj7x2odw4c1sjam19o1_500.png
B0019TYZ66|5|Best bonder to put on nails as first coat.  It really  helps to make the polish stick and last.
B001FB5HK6|5|Awesome scent!  My favorite of the Mitchum line. Glad I can buy it on line because it's hard to find locally.
B000FKJP9C|5|works well for my oily skin. cost-effective solution
B002WTC38E|4|Love this Shampoo. It smells great and makes your hair very soft & silky. I didnt give it 5 Stars because I feel like its to much money for this small bottle.
B002C741MM|5|I traded in my 8 year old Norelco for this unit because my old ones battery was dead and would not function without a charged battery. I specifically ordered the QT4021 because its one of the few beard trimmers that will run just off of wall power no matter the battery's condition. The vast majority of beard trimmers must be charged for some time before they will do one trimming. Most beard trimmers have very low quality NiCad battery's which dont hold a very big or very long charge. Even the lithium-ion battery chargers which come at a real premium only have a duty cycle of maybe 500 charges (by charge they mean every time its plugged in for any amount of time). Even with 500 good charges that's only a few years of service and honestly I dont want to throw out a trimmer just because the battery is dead while everything else about it works great. This trimmer with its ability to run off just wall power with or without the battery means a much longer functional life span.     The only downside is the guard cannot be removed. Its a much nicer guard as an end result but it cannot be used to get an exposed blade right next to your beard to make nice sharp lines or to trim the hair from your neck. For close precise work I have purchased a small no guard corded trimmer and together its the perfect combination.
B000JPMHWK|5|Probably the best I've used, and I've used a lot of different safety razors
B004FAJFDO|5|Love these
B001EMAMMY|3|Would have been cheaper in stores, pack wasn't as full as I thought.
B002N5MKM6|4|Good product...  like the shampoo better.  I have dry hair and this is not as conditioning as I hoped but still a good product.
B007K6JYLS|5|First off I want everyone to know I received this item free in exchange for an HONEST review from bzzagent. Now that that is out of the way let me continue with my honest review.<br /><br />I am amazed with this item, in the past I have always been against gel deodorant. I've just had bad experiences with them, but after trying this one I am happy and will be replacing my stock. Anyways I usually wear an invisible solid one and I honestly didn't know I had an issue with it. Day one I put on the gel and yes its cold to touch but it just slips on and only takes a little bit and dries up instantly. It felt great, smelled great. I didn't even realize I was wearing deodorant. So I go on throughout my day and its great, Im loving it that I haven't felt sticky, sweaty and just plain dirty in my pits. Day 2 I put on my invisible solid and right way I notice im feeling sticky! All day long I don't feel as comfortable as I did with the gel... im feeling sticky, I can feel the deodorant on my skin, it just doesn't feel natural! So I shower and reapply the gel and its like I applied nothing. I feel free with it on. Im honestly amazed and in love with this product.
B00EZZRRHK|5|I love this serum!! It is everything it says it is. It's light, and oh So nice, makes your skin feel nurished. I wear it under my daily moisturizer, and my skin loves it! I Recommend it-- Ladies quit spending hundreds for products at beauty counters...this product is wonderful! and it works!!
B000052YOV|5|SCENT:  It's one thing to review how the moisturizers work in a lotion product, but the difficult part is to describe to a reader the scent that they will smell when receiving it. I can tell you quite confidently that this scent smells vaguely of the old Coppertone sunscreen you used to put on at the beach when you were a kid. It's very fresh and mild and brings back summertime memories all year long. When I read \\"Sesame Oil\\" I instinctively think of Thai noodles or some asian cuisine. This scent is nothing like that. Think of a cool breeze blowing the *mild* scent of the Coppertone on the person next to you at the beach and you have an idea of what it will smell like on.    SIZE:  I bought my really big container (32 FL OZ; 1 QT) at the Target store for about fifteen doll (they no longer carry it). I have very dry skin and use it about every other day, all year long and this size lasts me approximately 9 months. In other words, this 8.5 oz bottle would last me just a few months. So, if you have dry skin you might want to either find a larger bottle or stock up.

B00008LUPY|5|Anyone who says this is hard to use or flimsy must have been dropped on their head. It works exactly how you think it would, and as long as you don't hulk strength your tube out after your done it won't break.
B0058E3XJI|5|I love this lotion it goes on great and smells good. It gives a great color and quickly will continue to purchase this lotion over others. Great price too!
B00B1DR5WQ|5|Great color. I get lots of compliments.
B000C1Z6KG|5|Smells like Lilacs, lovely clean smell.
B000K8FUFM|5|Great beginner brush
B00EOB0042|1|This item gave me an itchy, burning, red rash. Returned for refund.
B0012SFQL2|3|The clippers are a bit heavy. I had to get my barber to adjust the blades to cut closer. They became a but uncomfortable, but I guess sacrificing pain for a sharper lining is plausible. I would recommend to anyone.
B003ZWVN2Y|1|I have wanted sparkley nail polish for a long time and I thought that this would be perfect, but it is ridiculous. This polish is practically a clear coat of polish because none of the hearts come out onto your nail. Trying to get a heart out onto your nail is very difficult and not worth the time.
B004FOQ9NY|1|Whatever ultra adhesive skin waterproofing and perfume chemical is in this cannot be healthy. This crap has made both my wetsuit and boardshorts smell horrible and i cant seem to wash the smell off of the clothing despite numerous, thorough hand washes in very soapy water. $8 dollar sunscreen seems to have cost an extra $350 in ruined gear.<br /><br />This was not old either, the product came out and went on smooth. The smell wasn't pleasant coming out of the bottle either.
B0054MSBPK|5|Just what I needed.
B00354XMH6|5|Let's face it. You're not going to be able to comb your mustache effectively with a standard sized comb, particularly if you're using beard balm or mustache wax. This is the perfect sized comb to not only train your lip hair, but distribute balm or wax evenly throughout (I use it on my entire Van Dyke). Now if I can just stop losing them since they are so small.
B003XW1EZM|5|This brush is awesome as I feel like it is more gentle when brushing out knots in your hair or while your hair is wet(at its most fragile state). I believe it does help to distribute your natural oils from your scalp to the ends of your hair- which needs moisture the most.
B00BCQ2TOG|2|Sorry, I just did not like this toothpaste, it just dissapeard in my mouth and it felt like I was not using anything at all. My mouth never felt &#34;clean&#34;, went back to Kiss My Face toothpaste.
B00AEIVIGS|2|Received the product and unfortunately it had a rancid smell, not sure if it has been stored for a long time but I had to returned it.
B000VV0EG8|5|I needed something to remind me of Isis, the television series. This was within my budget.
B0084ACOB6|5|It dries my hair quickly and I like how soft it makes my hair feel. It seems to give my hair more volume.
B0000YV83O|5|As I am approaching 40, I noticed my face sagging and wanted to derail it. I ordered this device from QVC and have been using it twice a day for a minimum of two minutes for the past year and love it. I have not had problems with lines. My jaw line has improved considerably, my cheekbones have risen and my overall muscle tone in my face has improved. I am an addict!
B003OIPJZ6|5|Makes skin look flawless. Can't recommend BENEFIT products enough, especially this one! Quality, quality, quality. One tip: invest in a gentle scrub cleanser and toner for a once a week deep cleaning. (This is basically spackle for your pores---but looks awesome and has caused me no skin reaction, even though my skin is very sensitive.) A bit pricey, but well worth the cost.
B0000A1WGK|5|I recently bought this hair straightener for my mother after it got rave reviews from my girlfriend. I have never used this hair straightener (hair is too short, I am a guy, etc.) but the common impression that my mother and girlfriend have given is that this is the best hair straightener anywhere near this price.     In terms of durability, my girlfriend has had this model for over 3 years now, and it looks as good as new whenever she uses and she has never complained.     So in conclusion, two women have said this model gives them the best hair straightening they can get, in the salon or out, and it is very durable. 5 stars.
B000273HTW|4|ok
B008RODQFM|4|A great little diffuser that really puts out a strong steady mist!  This is a small sized diffuser that would be perfect for a small/medium sized room.  The water will last several hours and it turns itself off once the water runs dry. I find that I don't want to put too much oil in at once or it will be way too strong. Just a drop or two is all it takes.  Easy to assemble and add water to. I would recommend this one!
B000X2W6LQ|2|In the 8 months my wife has had this - the mirror flew off twice.  The first time, she was able to put it back together without damage, the 2nd time - she was not so lucky.  The mirror broke into pieces.  This is no longer usable.  Very poor design.  Think twice before purchasing.
B00DPE9EQO|3|Did not notice any change to skin.
B000XPC8MA|3|I just got it and I guess i should have paid attention to the details. This item should be put on to the face and left on for about 30-60 mins 2-3 times pre week.  it smells good and it has small pieces of sea shell in it, i guess you could scrub your face with it but its very think when you put it on and coud be very annoying having to wear it for 30 mins at a time. But I will give it a try and come back with another review when the jar is empty.
B0030HNNS6|1|This craptastic product is complete false advertising. It is in no way smudge proof or waterproof. You get what you pay for.
B00FW63U6S|5|I bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift..and he loved it. Now am thinking of getting one for myself cos i loved it too even though its for men (i don't mind)
B002Z7FU5G|5|This is some of the Best Body around it is Sweet and HOT and if you put it on all the ladies will like you
B002Q2J4RU|3|good for giving hair some lift.
B00KQASCDG|5|I used Cleopatra's Organic Shea Butter to make a Cocoa Mocha Latte Body Butter! Whipped up beautifully with my other ingredients! End result was Heavenly! Creamy color with no harsh unpleasant odor! You won't be disappointed!
B00BZ1QN2C|3|This is not a facial mask. I would classify it as a sugar scrub. Thus I give it 3 stars for the miss representation. However, the product is luscious. Great exfoliation and wonderful smell. Just nothing like a facial mask. Overall a wonderful smelling sugar scrub.
B005I03536|5|Had this multi pack for more than three months. I have them spread out all over the house, none have been broken. They last and there are a ton of them. Buy with confidence.
B00OP26PE4|5|thank you
B0001TSIUE|5|My experience with the peppermint variety of Dr. Bronner's soap has been excellent. I have very sensitive skin and usually the soap i use is either chemically too harsh or loaded with chemical fragrances that can cause me allergy troubles. I first bought this soap on a lark as I've always liked the smell of peppermint and recently I've moved back to using a bath brush for exfoliation. The difference this soap and a brush have made are impressive as my skin has cleared up significantly. The peppermint smell is also wonderful and has actually garnered compliments... which has only been slightly awkward.    Unlike other the miraculous claims other beauty products make I actually can attest that I feel more energetic after my morning ablutions (Note: The wrapper claims this is due to the peppermint oil being a mild stimulant.) I enthusiastically recommend this product without reservation to anyone who is looking for a natural soap that serves its function well.
B00TIUKR0Q|3|Very pretty but a bit small.
B00LOSE4ZY|4|Nice product. I love all Murad products.
B00FRDPP6O|1|I do not know if it is this product, or the mask.  But I  purchased the shampoo and the mask at another store.  My hair started breaking off after using the Fekkai products,  it started emediately breaking off in the shower, I saw globs of hair on the comb, and on the drain the next day.  My hair is thick curly and was barely past the shoulders.  My hair is also bleached.  So far before using the Fekkai products, I have been able to manage my thick curly, bleached hair.  I wanted my hair to be more smoothe and heard so many good things about this line of products.  Instead of helping out my dry brittle, and split ends, my hair started breaking off instead.  I now have to always wear my hair up in shame to hide the embarrasing parts where it broke off.  It is so obvious, and so drastic, that I do not want a cut yet in fear more will fall out.  With others with hair like mine in the same bleached out condition.  RUN as far as you can from this product, or you too will have to wear your hair up in shame as well waiting for the ends to stop breaking off.
B002TPQPEE|5|My deaf finacee, she need buy mores color eyeshadow palette collections and she really a love work on the different brush her add color eyeshadow palette she can order in bh cosmetics too.
B000JNQSIQ|5|i love it
B0002DKNGQ|5|A woman at work wore this sometimes and whenever she did I would ask her what she was wearing. She always told me \\"it's Nude\\". She would laugh and say that men found it \\"interesting\\" as well. She said that she had been accused of using \\"chemical warfare\\" by men who were utterly commanded by her fragrance. Finally I purchased it and it smells even better on me. :) When you apply it, go light. I use just a tiny bit and people come in closer just to try and get a whiff. It is very provocative.
B0052AI6HW|5|I've had this for about 4 months and I love it! the shipping was fast and i have no complaints. Just be sure to use it only where you need it and in moderation because it will dry out your skin.Definitely will repurchase!
B00O27NYRS|2|I was hoping since I ordered large pins they would fit the largest roller in my set but they don't they are too small.
B007Z5XYQK|5|Wonderful product!  I apply about 5 drops of this to damp skin at night<br />instead of night cream.  It smells divine, but Eminence products are totally<br />organic and use only the finest ingredients so are really effective on the<br />skin.  Highly recommend as true skin therapy.
B004M1BO3U|5|My wife and I have both been happy Sonicare users for many years.  When she found these locally on sale and with a rebate, we could not say \\"no\\".  Each of us has an older model with a big screw-on brush head assembly.  Not only are replacement heads more expensive for that type but they also provide lots of space for crud to build up that requires regular cleaning or it gets really nasty.<br /><br />The Easy Clean looks like it should be much simpler to keep in a hygienic condition.  My wife is happy with the reduced size and weight compared to our older brushes.  For the price, you really can not do better although the more expensive Sonicare's do come with additional features (that may not matter to you) and sometimes accessories.  The one thing missing with this brush is a travel case.  Luckily, a quick search on Amazon found one with high ratings.<br /><br />Probably the most important part of a toothbrush is how well it cleans teeth.  My experience is with regular brushes and with 3 different Sonicare models.  With a regular brush, my teeth do not feel nearly as clean no matter how long I brush.  With the Sonicare, 2 minutes (via the built-in timer) gives really clean feeling teeth in a way that I can not at this time imagine purchasing any other brand of toothbrush.  Both my wife and I are extremely happy with our new brushes!
B001MA0QY2|5|Very happy with the product and enclosed accessories. It came as described, arrived quickly, and so far appears to be great value for the money. No complaints from me. I've very pleased to have not had to spend yet another $200 plus on a competing brand to get exactly the same results; highly recommending to friends and relatives as a \\"value plus\\" purchase.
B00C7HM818|4|This is a very good hot roller set.  Would recommend it.
B000XZKRMS|1|I've been using this just about daily (I'd say 5x/week) for two weeks and really can't tell - and I am not a naturally tan person! This smells like self tanner (though not a horrendous smell, but recognizable) without the benefit of added color. I'm frustrated that I wasted money and time on this product.
B00J2AP81U|5|Absolutely incredible shave! Its like I have a custom made shave every-time!!! The razor itself is just the best, they are Gillette razors. But the flex ball just makes all the difference. Every curve and every move is just flawless. not to mention the handle is very... classy. pick one up for yourself or your lover, you'll be glade you did.
B000F3VDAI|5|it helped my hubby get a better shave and not have to buy a new shaver or try to search for them in stores
B00NIPQ0GC|2|I didn't find that this product has helped with extending the life of my razor
B00OMBBKAW|5|I love this high quality sponges. They make my makeup application flawless. They are easy to use and easier to clean. I love this product and i will highly recommend this to anyone.
B007Q29WVI|4|Liked it!
B002XQ1RAG|5|I really like the scent of this perfume, I feel refreshed when smelling it. I use it all the time even at home ..<br /><br />Size is big enough .. price is good ..
B00NAIM3H2|5|Love these! Got them to take on my upcoming cruise!
B0022H6JQI|5|I'm on the older side now and my hair looked so dull (like doll hair) and I found this product and it is amazing. My hair looks and feels REAL now. I could never go without it.
B00HAM37G0|1|I bought this iron for traveling (not surprising). I gave it a test run when it arrived. The clamp was incredibly tight, preventing me from easily sliding a section of hair in and trapping and then breaking hair when I attempted to remove it. I tried just wrapping hair around the iron without success. The cord on the iron was as thick as the one on my vacuum cleaner! By the time you put the cord with the iron, it took up as much space as a regular size iron. The carrying case was nice but I'd still give this zero stars if I could. Returned immediately!
B00GTC1H5U|5|my 10 year old graddaughter enjoys this
B001GIOV1Y|5|Nice scent when used but she says she can't smell it after!
B0027LSEPS|5|Correct and fast delivery. Very useful appliance for teeth and gums hygienе and protection
B002LDXS94|3|Wonderful customer service, but unfortunately I am allergic to the product and developed a rash. If I was rating only on service, this would be five stars for sure.
B004A7OVBI|5|This is my new favorite eyebrow product! Love it and don't go without it when applying my makeup!
B002HEW8QQ|4|This smells good and is a good size bottle. It works well and I would buy it again at a later time.
B000S97MAY|5|Maybe \\"real men\\" don't use eye cream...but I do (and have for over 30 years) and I'm all man. This product is awesome. I started using kiehls products when I discovered this wonderful shop around the corner from where I used to live on Manhattan's lower East Side. As a former actor I had been exposed to a number of expensive moisturizers and none compared to kiehls. I'm not certain exactly when the avocado eye cream was introduced, but it's been in my medicine cabinet for at least three years. I swear it seems to plump up the area under the eye and leaves it looking natural and totally refreshed. When people tell me I look the same as I did back in the day I just say with a smile...I've been \\"embalmed\\".
B00012C5IW|5|This is the best product ever invented!  It keeps the oil and shine away for up to 8 hours, I only wish it was available in a more 'manly' package! he he, I would feel better that way, but I really don't care as long as it works.  All guys should try this in addition to women.
B006GKHIHQ|4|I love these..there so easy to put on an there comfortable they also the rite length for me..so I ordered some more for me an my friend
B00065AS60|3|These are just average - they are difficult to grip. The quality is good.
B003GMVD96|3|It chips so fast and I don't like the fact that I have to apply a shine coat since it doesn't shine the slightest, but I heard that's pretty common for neon colours. There are two things I don't like about this collection a) chips too fast b) for the lightest colours you need more coats, especially for the yellow one! The good things I have to say are that the colours are absolutely stunning and I will never regret my purchase despite the flaws <3
B00AWD22O2|3|This is not for thick toe nails, but okay for regular use.
B004KEX2Y8|5|I love this stuff works better than anything else I have tried. Bummer they only have one. They run kinda light so remember to order a shade darker than you usually get. I'll be looking for more.
B003JJWQRY|5|I have been using this Remede sunscreen for several years now.  I like the silky, light texture on my skin, which tends to be a bit oily in the summer.  The #2 shade provides a bit of color so no need to layer on lots of foundation.  A little goes a long way--bottle lasts a long time.
B00K2O3NV2|5|Love this acid serum. It's light and absorb fast and it makes my skin clean and clear. Will recommend to friends and family.
B00BCRD9V2|1|No as good of a toothpaste as the other reviews state.
B00KWG4X96|5|Feels great on my skin,I added a few drops too my hair (hot oil) treatment
B00R2L69EG|4|As part of a free trial pack, I received the Crest Pro Health HD pack a few weeks ago.  My first couple of brushings, I was expecting more action, but I started out using smaller amounts than I might normally.  I didn't want to overwhelm my mouth, so I slowly worked up in amounts of toothpaste from there until I could feel an effect.<br />The Step 1 is a fairly mild flavor, I assume to not offend different tastes.  Too little, and it loses the flavor quickly, but hitting the tipping point and it lasts for the full brushing.<br />Step 2, at lessor amounts, was hard to even notice anything else was there.  The flavor was a little more astringent, but not bad.  As the amounts increased, finally hitting that &#34;sweet spot&#34;, I could feel it taking it's effect.  Not bad, just noticeable.<br />You might think to use half the amount of toothpaste on each step, equaling a full amount you might normally.  But instead, think of these as two separate brushings, each requiring the full amount(give or take a bit) that you would normally.  This is where I was initially unimpressed, then as the amounts increased, so did my opinion on the product.<br />One question I saw being asked was, is this an every-day toothpaste.  For myself, I think the answer is no.  I don't have generally sensitive teeth, but there are some spots that are responding a little more sensitively than I'd like.  I think, unless you're a heavy smoker/coffee drinker, you probably don't need it all of the time anyway.  Once you get the base staining taken care of, you can let your mouth rest, and just start an upkeep routine mixed with your normal brushing cycle.  This is purely my opinion on the matter, as I have no official answers to relay.<br />To the questions of does this actually work, I have to say most definitely.  In just the two weeks of brushing, even starting slow and working my way up, I've seen noticeable improvements in the color of my teeth.  Due to the sensitive spots(probably due to recent dentist cleaning), I had to stop for a little while, but the old staining is not returning.  Step 1 does a great job of cleaning initially, which helps Step 2 get to all of those places that are harder to reach.<br /><br />The price of $38 that I'm seeing around(unsure on Amazon's final price), would make me choke on my toothbrush if it were my normal daily toothpaste.  However, now having my initial cleanings/whitenings completed, I can stomach that price tag for a weekly maintenance for myself.<br />My only caution would be those with either sensitive teeth, or sensitive gums/areas, is to take it slow.  Start off with smaller amounts initially, and work up to your comfort level.  Instructions/suggestions to this matter would help really round out the product, and would prompt me to update to 5 stars.<br /><br />In short, if you are at all considering a whitening product for your teeth, this would be the one I suggest.  A very simple substitution for your normal brushing routine, and you're on your way to a whiter brighter future.dentist cleaning), I had to stop for a little while, but the old staining is not returning.

B00L4I4TOA|1|This product too me. Is better than Amazing Herbs. The color is darker and stronger. Kill a cough in seconds.
B003KFZ83Q|5|Superb fast shipment, good quality of scarf ring!
B0049OLZ84|5|I love this product. I saw a noticeable difference in my skin almost immediately. It doesn't smell, it isn't heavy which makes it perfect for me.
B00D7S1466|4|This is a wonderful barbering tool. Really smooth on the skin and it's made my skin fad s that much better. However i don't like that it only stays charged for an hour whether it's being used or not. if the battery is dead and you need to use it, it doesn't work when it's plugged into the chord. The chord is only for charging the battery, it is not powerful enough to run the machine. So you need to make sure you charge it for at least an hour before you use it cause if it dies then you're screwed
B001ET76AI|5|I've been a lifelong sufferer of sinus problems and fairly obnoxious morning-breath.  No, seriously... we're talking about the smell of a dumpster behind a fast food restaurant during an August heat-wave.  After using this stuff for 2 days, my morning breath is gone and my mouth & throat don't feel like sub-Saharan Africa when I wake up. In all seriousness, this stuff is amazing.  If the price seems a little steep to you, think about all the money you've wasted on crap that didn't work...
B004N79BYC|5|Great Product and Great Packaging. Has a vent to remove excess air from the bag once opened. The price can not be found anywhere else for a product made in the USA. This product works awesome for Detox or Epsom Salt baths. Very Recommended.
B007W3DMQC|5|The color is as bright as it appears on the box, it looks amazing and lasts for weeks. It is very thick though and took almost two tubes for partial highlights and peekaboo highlights but well worth it. It is ready to use which is great.
B00027CCCK|5|I received this on time and was very happy to get it. I couldn't find this in the stores I visited in medium was getting frustrated glad to get it from amazon.
B002U2Y3Q8|5|...I even got it growing outside.  I have bought this product before. I love love the scent! I like how it feels on the scalp and I like how it makes our (Caribbean) hair smell. My hair is thick and relaxed and my daughter's hair is thick, natural and tightly coiled. It's not greasy.  Has no petrolatum and mineral oil - yay!!!.  But I also use it in conjunction with outher products.
B007SZCG0C|5|I have been using this shampoo daily for the past week.  It lathers up really well and the smell is great!  I love the fact that the bottle is a pump dispenser so there will be no waste - a really great touch.  From the third use I noticed zero shedding when washing my hair - which is amazing as I usually shed quite a lot when washing my hair.  I am also shedding a lot less when drying my hair (which is coarse and brittle in texture) and have noticed that it feels substantially thicker and less prone to breakage.  I will definitely be using this from now on and will be excited to see the results after a month's use.
B004WDV2XA|5|I wrap sections of my hair in spirals around these then bend the end flaps down to hold it in place for loose curls
B000YBZIAC|1|Unfortunately, it has some toxic chemicals in there so I would not recommend using it. It does work well in cleaning my skin, but it has chemicals that has been classified as toxic to the eye in Europe and as toxic to the reproductive system in Canada according to the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database at [...].
B001FB5ILE|5|Hard to find in stores. Not oily, long lasting.
B009NPOXVK|5|I purchased this for my husband's birthday.  The scent is out of this world!  We both love it.  He stated that this is extremely masculine.
B00HIMER0W|5|Great value. I love the size of these because you can cut them to whatever size or shape you need. These will last a very long time.
B00AJFAK92|5|MY 8 year old got a sample of this to try and she loved it! She said it left her mouth feeling very fresh. And it wasn't too hot for her,which is sometimes an issue. I would definitely recommend this to other parents.
B00QT14EB0|3|Works really well, but has a very bad smell.
B000WNLFBI|3|Moisturize s well but a bit sticky
B0077LAJT2|5|Great value, and a smooth shave.
B00R2L69EG|5|You will notice a difference quickly with this Two Step Toothpaste. You have to brush you teeth twice but each step does wonders. Toothpaste is very high quality and leaves your mouth feeling fresh. Whitening paste works very well and you can quickly see a difference. I will continue to use this duo and love the why it has changed the health of my teeth! Highly recommend! (received this product as a promotion from the brand)
B00HJLAILO|3|they are lint free but for me not worth the money I paid!
B000IMJS0S|5|This soap works wonders. I just use it 2-3 times a day and my face has never felt cleaner,It does not dry your skin
B003H83BYY|1|did not get
B001G7QF5A|5|I do not usually write reviews, but I felt I had to on this product. I have tried everything I could find on my dentures and I just could not keep my dentures in place. And with Fixodent and pollygrip I went crazy y=trying to get all the glue out of my mouth. This product from Poligrip is GREAT.I do not say GREATwithout meaning it, Three strips on upper dentures and two strips on lower dentures and my dentures are in for the day. I can eat and chew my food and Its been a longtime for me to do this. At night rinse mouth with warm water and the little bit of glue left in my mouth using a tooth brush ,and it comes right out. They could get a bit expensive for some but if you want a product that REALLY WORKS this is the one to buy..
B00V46B30A|4|Great quality lashes. However I am of asian nationality and my eyes are small. There a bit long for me. Otherwise they are pretty.
B000P20RAQ|5|very good product in relation to price, I recommend
B000141JGO|1|I hate this stuff. It doesn't specifically say how to use it- so without knowing, I used quite a bit thinking it would be like a hair mask. Now my hair is greasy and oily and it is impossible to wash out. If anyone has tips on how to get this crap out of my hair, please let me know.
B001BKR5X8|5|I love this scent and also have the perfume oil of the same brand. The incense leaves a nice smell even after it is no longer burning. I will continue to purchase this product as long as it is available. I even like it more than the Nag Champa, which used to be my favorite. It is very sweet and sensual smelling in my opinion.
B0018QI886|5|Thank you
B00CP4H3T0|4|very good shaver for the money
B001A158FK|5|This is the best razor I've owned to date! My face is smooth as a baby's butt and the ladies now find me adorable! One charge has lasted an entire month! Razor arrived in like new condition - couldn't tell it was refurbished. No regrets buying!
B000PI3AWW|4|Great shaves using for years.
B00DCF7QW0|5|Received this free for a review, I have been using this for about a week and unless my eyes are deceiving me this is working.  I have been using on my thighs and have seen a reduction in cellulite. I am not heavy set but have put on some weight as I have gotten older so cellulite has appeared goes on very nicely if you follow the instructions and rub it in the way the directions explain you can actually feel it working.  I will continue to use this product and add to this as I go along. Thank you so far I am liking this product.
B007XX4EYU|2|No better coverage really than any other white polish. Needed three coats minimum.
B00112939A|4|only worn a couple of times, but I like what I have used.
B003OELYFO|5|I am always concious of my thinning hair in the front. This product is easy to use and works well.
B00AZBSPQA|5|good to have
B000ZLQJHC|5|I had a sever chemical burn.  The prescription cream worked well, however a heath care worker told me about Sudocrem, and I decided to give it a try.  I applied the cream lightly as directed. To my surprise, the Sudocrem Antiseptic Cream worked faster than the prescription, speeding up the healing of the chemical burn.  I would recommend this cream for rashes and chemical burns.  However, reaction to any medicated cream will vary from one individual to another.<br /><br />Therefore:<br /><br />***PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE TRYING OTHER PRODUCTS.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />August 18, 2014
B0009WY55K|5|Tresemme Shampoo Deep Cleanse, Purify and Replenish is the best shampoo, only shampoo I use.  My whole family uses this shampoo and we all can tell when I buy something else.
B003BWNR9A|4|Brush not bad at all.Put some tooth paste on brush and leave for 24 hours. Repet 3 times to take bad smell out
B001ESC1O0|5|I loved the Earth's Best Tots Tangle Taming Shampoo (the one with the alligator on the bottle) and was bummed when I couldn't find it anywhere.  I decided to give this shampoo a try and it is exactly the same!  I noticed it smelled and lathered like the EB shampoo and when I compared the ingredient list on my old EB bottle to the JASON bottle I saw they were identical.  This is a great product for kids whose hair needs a bit more scrubbing than baby shampoo can tackle.  I use conditioner as well and have never had any tangle problems, even after swimming.
B0009XH6NW|3|\\"Dual voltage charger for worldwide use\\" - unlike the chargers for my laptop, phone, and tablet; which can all safely be connected to 100 to 240 volts; the Andis 22725 requires you *manually* choose the power input. Picking the wrong option permanently fries the charger. This is exactly the kind of decision/mistake you don't want to make when jet-lagged/traveling, or simply when tired and shaving in early morning. It's a significant usability failure, especially when the Andis charger is also quite bulky compared to those for other devices.<br /><br />That aside, the \\"raw\\" trimmer works, and it's cheap.<br /><br />I don't use the attachments, so I haven't experienced the problems some other reviewers reported. I also haven't owned an Andis 22725 long enough to comment on battery life.
B008CC3LWC|3|This toothbrush is a simple design with small footprint .  It works well and there are no complicated \\"bells and whistles\\"
B00X4HJVME|5|This lotion is the ONLY one I've found that actually keeps my thumbs & fingertips from drying & cracking. It's amazing stuff, and smells wonderful to boot! The Orange Blossom Honey is also an excellent product from The Naked Bee folks, but the sandalwood in this formula seems to make it even more effective, and quickly soothes my hands after a long day.
B001G5FOLI|5|nice, smooth and sharp
B00G5L89JM|5|Makes brushing so easy for kids!
B000CNO4DO|5|I'm so happy with my purchase!!!
B003S516XO|5|This is the best straightener I've ever used. I normally have it set up to 390 or 400 degrees to straighten my thick hair, but that might be too much for some people. So, definitely start at a lower temp. It's definitely worth the money!
B0042GH78G|4|I love the smell of the ginger. The product is okay for every day use, but if you want to spend significantly more money on a smoothing shampoo, this would probably be it. It does work great with my hair and it has left it soft and silky.
B000P3NG7Q|5|this is the best cream i ever found to date i have a very dry skin and yhius is the only obe thatworked
B005Z4DBY8|5|Was exposed to this product on a British Air flight.  Light, easily absorbed. Best moisturizer ever.  Great scent. Works beautifully. Expensive, but can be used sparingly. The tiniest amount will do.  This size will last a year.
B00EL99TYO|5|I bought it as a gift for my sister, she hasn't mentioned anything about the pom pom coming off like other reviews. She loves it and it is a good size, fits many things.
B007ZRZSR6|5|I purchased this oral irrigator to replace a WaterPik model that couldn't hold a charge.  This oral irrigator works very well and only has to be charged every three weeks.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the fact that it has three different settings. I also like the fact that it shows when it needs to be charged and then shows when it is fully charged.  My WaterPik did neither.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it!!
B00B4E3GT8|5|Love the shade and shimmer. Plus nice minty taste.
B00CC7Y000|5|It is a great product.  Used it for many years.
B003U9K9J0|5|THIS MIRROR LETS ME SEE THINGS THAT OTHER MIRRORS CAN'T. I LOVE THIS MIRROR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
B000928EE8|5|Dryer is great, very powerfull and hangs nicely.<br />Delivery was very fast and in perfect condition.<br />I will recommend this product its a great buy for the money!!
B0009OAGPG|2|Believe not original. Doesn't smell the same. Package not good. Not a true original product.  I used cologne for years I now it
B00TXZF256|5|Been using this product for a while now and beginning to see results. My skin looks firmer and not as wrinkled. Would recommend this product!
B00GQU5YY0|2|Okay I have it two stars because it did arrive earlier than expected. First off the brush is beyond cheaply made, it started falling apart just looking at it. The brush had no protection tip on it, and they were just put in a bubble packing bag. I know it was like $2.00, but I have spent less on better. I'm just going to stick with what I know. I will not be buying this again.
B00AMQWWO4|5|Long lasting and beautiful! Jusr what I wanted
B00C3WT3HE|3|The color is strong but its a little sticky and gets in the creases of your lips if they are dry. make sure to put chapstick on before applying
B0012H11TO|3|this product is satifactory. It doesn't clean as well as i would of liked. But it is serving its purpose at this time, thank you.
B004FEO38C|5|This is by far the best dark tingle tanning lotion I have ever used. I get a nice even brown NOT ORANGE from using this lotion. I do not use it every day, the tingle is too strong for me to use on a daily basis but love to use it at least once a week! The smell is great, not too overpowering and this lotion goes on well, not streaky! Highly recommend this lotion if you are a fan of tingle!
B00BK5XNHG|5|If you're looking for a palette that has matte colours this is the one for you! Simply amazing. Can be applied dry or wet. Wet gives u a brilliant application with vivid colour. A must have for affordable pricing.
B0012IN8Q2|5|Works so well for my small mini sets of lashes (I don't remember what they're called, but there's about 3-4 lashes to a group that you put on). I put the glue onto the package and let it sit for about a minute, then I grab the group of lashes and dip them into the glue and apply. Easy as that. I've never been able to put on a full set of lashes, but then again, I've never tried with the DUO. I may have to do that some day. If I do, I'll update this review. But the glue is perfect for what I use it for. It dries clear and my own mother thought I just got some really good mascara!!!!
B00I6DRRFE|5|I order this 5 at a time.  I like this because I do not have to sharpen this.  It twists out as needed. It comes in several colors and is also carried by Walgreens.
B001MA0QY2|5|I love this straightener most straighteners won't straighten my hair very well ( very curly hair) but this one is awesome!!! And the shipper is amazing!!!
B00Q2MYU1U|4|This product greatly reduced the pain associated with razor bumps after facial shaving (my husband). Just on a whim, I used it on my legs after shaving because for some reason, I experience a light burning sensation followed by a light rash every time I shave my legs. I'm happy to report that this product prevented the burn and I didn't spend the rest of the night scratching the top layer of skin on my legs off.<br /><br />It's definitely worth the buy.
B00KYZA8DA|5|Doctor Don makes superior products and this one is no exception.  Good quality and does the job!
B00J2AP9F0|5|I will happily admit that I am a Gillette man. Like almost everyone, I hate shaving, yet when i have a Gillette product in my hand, invariably I am more confident of my ability to get a clean, close shave without nicks and cuts and this shaver delivers on all levels. Note that I did receive this Fusion ProGlide manual razor with FlexBall Technology to test for free from Gillette through Bzzagent. I was also provided with the Fusion 2-in-1 shave gel. Together they are a winning combination. I love putting the shave gel on in the morning after a shower and feeling the cooling sensation hit my face. Then the razor just makes quick work of whatever growth I have going on. The FlexBall especially feels like i am getting to all the hard to reach places and getting an even shave. Then, the cooling feeling persists even after I am done, leaving my face feeling refreshed. A Gillette man I will remain...
B000KQ1E5Y|3|I bought a bottle of this at MGM Grand Detroit at the spa there. It last a long time from May till just recently. However this stuff I received from Amazon seems watered down compared to the little amount I had left in the other bottle. Also it didn't seem to lather up as well. Smelled about the same. Still cleans your face but there seems to be a difference unless they changed the formula...
B007HJ9VFM|5|Great
B00E88590G|3|They were good, about on part with other headbands that we've purchased for my daughter. I was expecting them to be better, because frankly, they look better in the picture. When the arrived I was a little disappointed because it is not what I was expecting. Now that I've had a little while to get over the initial disappointment I realize that they're on par with just about everything else that we've purchased for my daughter. Quality is average. Look is good. Colors are fantastic. Good, not great.
B001EJOQAG|5|Love this toothpaste!<br /><br />- Seems to be less toxic than most other toothpaste.  I really like to brush my teeth with toothpaste (I usually mix baking soda with a very small amount of paste to minimize the amount of toothpaste I use), but most of the major brand ones out there are full of artificial sweeteners and fluoride and all sorts of other stuff.  This one is by no means perfect, but it seems to at least be better.<br />- Tube is great.  Some brands have switched to plastic tubes and pop caps... Fail.  This is the old metal tube that stays compressed once there is less content in the tube.  Makes for super-easy squeezing.. sometimes too easy actually - I've had a couple times where too much comes out, especially when you first open a new tube.<br />- Seems to work just as well as other toothpastes.  I've not noticed a difference when brushing.<br />- I don't know what everyones talking about with the taste being bad.  To me, this stuff tastes awesome and if anything is more powerful and minty-fresh than I want.  Like I said earlier, I mix a small amount with baking soda when I brush - this stuff very much overpowers the baking soda and then some.  Makes my mouth tingly.
B00FFTUN2G|5|Great product
B00016XJ4M|5|i love it
B007RY6RGS|5|Lovely. Keeps your hair soft, also promotes hair growth. Thank you.
B0052JN7XG|5|I wanted to tell you that my poor old Sonicare electric toothbrush has lasted at least THIRTY-FIVE years...it was sold to me by my dentist when they first came onto the market!  I have used it daily for all these years (I'm 83 years old!) and it started to become very noisy lately.  I just found the problem, and thought I'd share it...the outer body has cracked from the small rectangular hole in the threads at the top of the main body, so of course the vibration noise has increased.  Now I will have to replace it, but I think you might be pleased to know it has lasted so long!
B0002Z8DIY|5|I have used this product for years, does wonders for your hair in keeping it healthy, tangle free, I like it a lot.
B002FXGGW6|5|its perfect for my hair, very light and soft!
B002DGJP2I|5|Glasses seem strong and fit well.  They have some flexibility and are comfortable.  The case is sturdy and useful.  I'm very happy with the purchase,.
B0061JPJH8|5|My 15-year-old son love this antiPerspirant Deodorant and the Axe 2-in-1 shampoo, Anarchy scent. I like the multi-pack so he doesn't have to ask me to get it as often.
B003FC22CO|5|I have used this hair spray for years and really like it.  I have tried others but always come back to this spray.<br /><br />I like it because it does make your spray hold but its my hair isn't stiff and cannot move.  I can spray my hair and still manipulate it if I need too.  The only thing I don't like is the pump spray on this bottle.  It often doesn't spray well like hairspray should.  It seems that the aerosol doesn't work so it sprays just one area versus sprays the area.  I still had a bottle that my Spritz Forte came in many years ago and it works perfectly. Like any hairspray, I run hot water over the nozzle to keep it from \\"gumming up\\".  I recommend that you put the hairspray into a different spray bottle if this happens to you.  The manufacturer should find a spray bottle that works better.  Overall, I really like this product.
B00D4X3Y4O|5|I love this deodorant. Once I start moving I smell like coconuts and lime, my favorite scents! It is sticky which is to be expected but that can be remedied with just using it sparingly, don't apply a large amount it's not necessary.
B00EOAZZXO|5|I am transitioning to more natural &#34;stuff&#34; and the chemical anti-persirants are far from natural. I purchased this and one other brand of natural deodorant on Amazon.  The other brand I got in roll on and in spray.  I am very disappointed with both forms of that brand but am surprised at how well I like the Green Tidings.  I really like the fragrance and I can smell it occasionally throughout the day which is refreshing and better than alternative smells!<br /><br />Although I want to be natural, I wasn't convinced I would be able to use a natural deodorant (without an antiperspirant) regularly.  I have a medical condition that makes me sweat profusely regardless of the weather or physical activity-I have to carry a &#34;sweat rag&#34; with me everywhere which is really embarrassing and very unprofessional at work. My face & head are always the first to sweat, followed by my back and then every other part of my body.  Although my armpits aren't the sweatiest area, I have been using the &#34;clinical&#34; strength formula of traditional antiperspirant.  Despite my perpetual state of sweat and previously using the clinical antiperspirants, I have easily adopted the green tidings and have been very pleasantly surprised at how well it works!  I have only had to use backup antiperspirant once since I began using the green tidings.  Once!  It's really been an easy transition because there has been no transition.  I just started using it & that was it.  I didn't have to wait the month like they said some people take to adjust to not having an antiperspirant.  I think I put on too much and go through it really quick compared to how long the traditional antiperspirant sticks lasted me, but the positives outweigh the cost for me.<br /><br />The other brand that I bought at the same time as this was the Crystal in the roll on and spray form.  I think it's the same liquid, just in a different dispenser.  Neither works.  I guess they might be deodorant, but they leave meclammy and I can't stand that.  I guess you get what you pay for because they were cheaper than this brand.  I hope that those of you out there with various medical conditions that cause far too much unnatural sweat will give this a try if you are looking for a more natural product.  I didn't think it would work and now I'm never going back to traditional products.  I am glad that I have found a natural product!!
B00AEGCAOE|4|Works as it is suppose to- the bucket I got looked liked it melted a little the harden up, but still in chunks.
B0089GOBGQ|5|I loved it I have brought this about 3 times
B00BSNBO9O|5|I love this stuff! I use this twice a day after applying Paula's Choice 2% BHA and before my serum. I also sometimes use it on my chest and hands. I really notice a difference in how moisturized my skin is when I use this, especially around my eyes. I also use a regular moisturizer, but this might be enough on it's own for some people. Highly recommend.
B009VD3KUE|4|I've used this item before and more than 2 at a time. Some have lasted only a month, and others over a year.  The long lasting one seemed to have a stronger &#34;motor&#34; and worked beautifully.  I've never seen one as strong as that particular drill, and the newest one isn't either.  In either case, the price was so low, I still don't believe it
B003Y7ID8W|5|I got hooked on the Premier Dead Sea products after a visit to the mall.  Yes, I got sucked into the presentation at the mall and I did buy two sets of products.  They were very expensive.  However, upon using the products for a week, I became a true believer in their effectiveness.  I simply must have the Eye Serum and the Vivo Lei facial peel.  I've only used the Prof. Peeling Mask a couple of times and feel that it is going to be as beneficial as the serum and the peel.  I also love, love, love the neck cream!  Fantastic!  I began to research these products on Amazon and found them all to be very affordable and was ecstatic to see that most of them will cost me much less than drugstore and department store products.  If only I had learned about these products years ago!  They are fabulous and the results are more evident every day!  You owe it to yourself to try them; buy them on Amazon - they're the real thing and they're a real deal!
B004DKAYUE|3|Not real pleased with this product. It was shipped to me promptly, but as far as the product goes it leaves ur hair feeling a little stickie to me.
B001IM5VT4|5|I've been using this moisturizer for seven years and I absolutely love it. I have complicated skin that gets both oily and really dry on top of being incredibly sensitive and this moisturizer balances it perfectly, and the radiance part is very subtle but makes my skin look good. People actually complement me on how healthy my skin looks. I have tried to change moisturizers but always end up going back to this one, since it seems to fulfill all my skin's needs with seasonal changes in weather better than anything else I've tried. I love it and will continue to use it for as long as I can.
B00JVUTNX0|5|Perfect price for great item. My mom loves it!
B0066TWJ5S|5|Nice pressent😃
B002MZ8BK2|5|This is an awesome product! You don't need to be a professional to use this, you just have to have patience and practice a couple times. Honestly, I would have paid a lot more for it now that I know how obsessed I am. I even bought one for my 16 year old sister & she's having a blast with it!<br /><br />I also had some trouble with the stamp picking up some images, but I believe that was because I used an off-brand image plate & the images just might not be deep enough. I never have that issue when I use a Konad plate.<br /><br />The scraper works just fine, but like others said, a gift card works just as well and is easier to clean. The small green end is great for smaller images, more control over where you stamp it.
B0013OJUY4|5|I love aveeno products and I love this lotion. It really helps my dry skin and I can use it safely on my son.
B00SOXI584|5|My hubby normally uses the Jack Black exfoliating soap, so we were familiar with this type of product. It works just as well as the Jack Black brand at a fraction of the cost. It has a very mild scent and my husband likes it. I will purchase this item in the future.
B004RKPV2Q|5|Love love love!! I'm bad with liquid eyeliners but this one is excellent!
B008MYNEBI|1|Hard to use
B003O1INFQ|4|I love that Larenim products don't contain gluten or a lot of chemicals.  That's why I started using them in the first place.  I have oily acne prone skin, and I have been making the switch to more natural products, which has helped some.  As far as coverage goes, Larenim provides a light buildable coverage, pretty much like any mineral powder foundation (I have tried many, including bare minerals and all the ones at the local pharmacy).  Anyways, because of the ingredients and the comparable coverage, I would rate Larenim 5 stars; however, I have had a difficult time finding the right color for my skin tone (hence the 4 starts).  I am part Native American (small part), but I have kind of an olive-red undertone to my skin, very few companies make something that works for me.  Originally, I was using 4-wm throughout the summer but it never really matched exactly, it was like it was the right darkness but too brown--hard to explain.  So I bought 3-wm thinking the other was too dark.  3-wm was a little too light for me so I would use the 3-wm as a concealer then do an all over layer with the same.  I would then do another layer with the 4-wm, especially in the places the sun would naturally hit.  This worked well, and it was not too thick because like I said they provide a light buildable coverage.  When I ran out of both (they lasted a long time for me), I decided to try 4-w, which is the loose version.  I had read a review that said it was more yellow than 4-wm.  I was hoping this would work better for me than the original.  I have not tried it yet... so we'll see.  I will point out that there are less ingredients in the loose powder and no dimethicone, which I believe the pressed may still contain?  Just a thought if that stuff is important to you.
B00112DWLK|5|This is my favorite eyeliner I have found in the past 4 years. This is the one that has lasted the longest with me. I have terrible allergies and thus had never bothered me. Comes off easy with a makeup remover and cotton pad.
B00005B9FV|5|I was trying skincentric trial and then change to other vitamin c serum. I develop redness and itchiness over my face. I used Eucerin lotion during the day and Eucerin cream at night religiously for three days. My face healed. I don't know about the anti-wrinkle effect yet. But, satisfied customer here!
B007KNAA2S|3|I tried this on my face for acne and fine lines. I started a month prior with the Hylauronic acid, then added this. They say not to add more than one item at a time. The HA has been great, but I think the argan oil may cause my to break out just a little. Nothing severe like the acne I'm used to but definitely doesn't keep my face clear. I also tried this in my hair and I feel it made it look too oily, but that could just be my personal hair type. I will try again with this on my face in localized areas where I have some small lines. I don't give up easily.
B006SFJRVO|4|Nice little shaver for the price.  It even has a pop-up trimmer.  Runs on 2-AAA batteries.  Recharging cord would have been a nice feature to have instead of batteries.

B00J0BPH44|5|Got this for my boyfriend, who is not at all into men's products, but he has really taken to this one. A fresh, masculine but not too strong scent, and good for the skin--less ingrown hairs, etc since he started using.
B00005JHWB|3|I got this mask brand-new from big lots, and whether or not you want a review of big-lots, I'm gonna give one here too. I got stuck going to big lots with a friend to look for a plunger, which we did not find, but I did realize I have a lot less esteem for Jerry van dyke than I used to. The prices are outrageous for a so-called \\"outlet\\" store, ($5 for two lightbulbs!), but I did find this mask at a reasonable price. What happened? Jerry is peddling liquidated merchandise, and Dobber, (name on Coach), is now sponge bob's lover patrick. Anywho, about the mask-I have chronic insomnia (which is hard on my only 20something skin, thus the need for this type of product), and I remember amusing myself in the wee hours by watching this infomercial, which was rich with all the usual hilarious cliches. I remembered the price of the mask being like $300 or something, and at $12.00 big lots, I thought it was a great buy, after all it's the infamous rejuvenique! If anything, I'm an artist, and a pretty wierd person, and I knew I could have some fun with it someway, if it worked or not. I figured it wouldn't work and might burn somewhat, like those ems weight-loss belts that got pulled off the market, but ems is used for physical therapy patients who can't move muscles well on there own yet, and so it wasn't like this was totally frankenstien science. After I got it home I read all the instructions, and gave it a try. The mask didn't fit my face well, and the contacts did dimple my face a bit, (went away after a few minutes), and I had to hold it in place, wich was not \\"relaxing\\", nor rejuvenating. The gel was really hard to apply to the contacts in any exacting manner, but I managed to get an appropriate amount of gel onto the contacts. I put the mask on, positioned it like instructed, and turned the unit on. The instructions say to start at 3, but I did at 2, just to be safe. I ended up going past 4 on my lips down, but I didn't turn it down in time before it passed my brows again, and it hurt quite a bit! I was reminded of the scene in \\"G\\" with eddie murphy, where Morgan Fairchild turns her dermo-toner up to high, which caused me to laugh, which caused more pain! I thought for sure I'd have visible burns, but no such luck. By the time I got half-way through my treatment (the machine passes twice down one side of face then the other), my cat was seriously spooked by the mask, and was howling and trying to get me to take it off, so I did. OMG! I couldn't believe it, the left side of my face was actually firmer to the touch. the dark circles and puffiness around my eye was almost gone, and you could really see a difference in my skin tone, and the structure of my face! My left eye looked open, and my brow wasn't furrowed, my laugh lines were nearly gone, it was like a mini-face lift or botox! The only problem is, I didn't do the other side, darn cat! The system works for me, but now the right side of my face is droopy, it's hard to focus my eyes, because one is open and the other is droopy, and my pupils are confused as what size to maintain. I guess I'll use it again tommorrow, and leave it off my face for the first half of the treatment. Hopefully that will work, my Aunts coming to visit tuesday, and as of right now, I look like a stroke victim. Oh well, maybe she'll feel sorry for me and pay for my photography classes, either that or she'll make fun of me, and I'll let her borrow my rejuvenique, and rig it to stay at 7. ;/in, and it hurt quite a bit!

B000JY0X4U|5|This is a great shaving cream. The menthol gives it a cooling effect that seems to sooth your skin. I have been using this product for about a month now and I have no complaints and for the price it can't be beat.
B00YO1Q7SA|5|Great product been using this Mostrizer for over 10 yrs.
B00152S7V6|5|Great, wife loves it.
B005RMVBHC|5|Love love love this bag.mIt turned out to be great and my daughter really loved it. Hope to see more of these around.
B00E3HPFHE|1|I enjoyed the smell of this masque a lot. It seemed to dry extremely quickly compared to the other ones.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this masque dried my skin out so bad. Therefore, while I did not have oil and other gunk on my face, I was left with dry – to the point of flaky skin. This sort of shocked me since it had Shea Butter in it.<br /><br />After my experience with this one, I probably would not use it again. However, that has not to say I would not recommend it.<br /><br />*I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion. All the opinions expressed here are my own.*
B000P6I3WG|2|I am sure this product is very nice and high quality. I purchased it based on a recommendation from a natural website that I follow for a facial moisturizer recipe. My problem was the smell and I thought I loved the smell of roses, but this was just too strong and the strongness lingered.<br />So, unfortunately, I was unable to see any results from using this product because I couldn't get past more than a few days of using it.<br />Its hard to write reviews for these types of products, because scent selection is such an individual thing, but if you are on the fence, just keep in mind that this may be a bit strong.
B00G052NFE|5|I have been using this product, especially on a spot of my skin with pigmentation for 3-4 weeks. So far, it looks like the serum does slightly heal my skin, and my face shows some improvement.
B000C1W38O|1|Nice smell.. does not last more than 5 minutes. Disappointed.
B003FVDNO6|5|I've always wanted to try this but never wanted to pay for it. I recently got an amazon gift certificate, so I decided to take the plunge. It is SO useful. No more thousands of bobby pins and ugly doorknob hair from hairbands. It is really tight and though it was hard to use at first and I was extremely disappointed, it works well now that I figured out how to use it. It does take a bit of practice, so don't get discouraged! I have thick long slippery Asian Hair with lots of layers. It still stays tight and *most* of the hair stays in the bun, however I do have to use one bobby pin sometimes to tame a big flyaway..or whatever you call it. Shipping was on time and I would def. recommend this product.
B00Q3DGMKA|1|This is not a genuine It Works! facial applicator. They do not look anything like this. Beware.
B00CWVGWPW|4|Light is tiny and didn't get the gloves.  The rest is just your normal polish.  Nice that it all came together.
B00SI5YVLI|5|Love my hair right now because of this product. So thumps up!
B00112DUFS|4|LOVE THE COLORS.
B000SST81Q|2|It's been a couple of months since I purchased this brush.  Unfortunately it has not worked on my hair as described. I had great expectations for this brush considering that a $3 brush I bought before this one does a much better job at getting my hair smooth and silky. Guess it is not meant to work on my fine and slightly wavy hair.
B001G7R3JW|4|It's a good moisturizer, but too thick. Difficult to apply because it´s difficult to take the butter on my fingers before the application.
B00150LT40|5|I have no idea how other people are having so many problems with this top coat. I've had nothing but excellent results! In fact, when it comes time to change polish, I have to SCRUB this stuff off. My polish doesn't chip hardly at all and I leave my nail polish on for a week or so. I'm not easy on my polish either - I have kids and an OCD clean house, so I'm constantly washing my hands and cleaning, playing around with the kids, etc. It dries super quickly and contrary to what the number one critical reviewer claims, I've used this as a \\"touch up\\" to bring shine back to my polish and had no issues whatsoever. It does have an odor but I use it in a ventilated area (as you should do with any polish anyways) and I don't have problems with it. I don't like that it contains toulene but until there is another top coat that is in any way comparable to this one, I'll continue to use it.
B001EJOPQG|5|The only product that I ever used, that says what it does to hold your dentures.
B0015NZ6FK|5|I could sleep all day with this mask.  Super comfy.  Good fit so no light gets in.  Light enough that you don't even feel it.
B001CS8BJ6|5|I've used it daily for about 3 months,  and it works well.  Sometimes I miss a hair here and there, and once the hair is about 1/8 inch long or so, the razor won't cut it.  I use a disposable razor to knock back those hairs, and the Panasonic does the rest.  I used to use a high priced Norelco, and it was good also, but the shave was no better than with this Panasonic.
B00HG1JFXY|5|Apply after washing your hair. It really adds volume. My hair is fuller and thicker. There is no more breakage. I recommend this product to anyone experiencing thinning hair.
B00LRZ5Q1U|4|Love the color.  On my skin it's an iridescent light pinkish purple.  I got this to use on my body and face for a show where I'm playing a fairy, but I think it would look equally beautiful as a highlighter on any young person.  (Actually, even though I'm a little more mature, I have used it as a brow bone highlighter.  Very pretty.)<br />I put it on before working out yesterday (for an hour and 15 minutes) to see how it would hold up to sweat, etc.  It definitely wore off/sunk in by about 75%, but that's not a problem for me because I won't be sweating that much for that long during the show and can re-apply backstage as needed.<br />The only drawback is that the amount of product is MUCH less than I thought I was buying.  The container is only about 1-1 and 1/2&#34; diameter.
B0036GAM7G|4|Too light for me, it's on the pink side and I am more neutral. Latte is a good fit for me but still not right. I am thinking I can't be matched in Jane:( it's a very good product if you can match it
B005YB42KE|2|I first smelled this product at a Macy's for a quick second and pleasantly enjoyed it. When I found out that they didn't have the original cologne I wanted there, I figure I'd search around here to find it. When I saw that they had this cologne here for 40 bucks cheaper with free shipping, I thought why not? It smells terrible. Maybe it's because I only smelled it for a second in store, but now that I've actually smelled it on me, it smells bad. It smells super sugary and musky at the same time, and the smell makes me nauseous. Since I've already used it, I can't return it back to Amazon, I'm stuck with 4.2 ounce of cr*p smelling cologne. DON'T BUY.
B00XG8UW9C|2|I ordered a dark brown one but got a jet black one. I'm not happy about that at all. The wig is a nice wig though
B000OO2YYM|5|5 stars speaks for itself.
B005DH6ZNQ|5|good product
B00EYG72CU|5|Best buyer
B000CCSXFU|5|This waxing kit was so easy to use.  I've never used hard wax before so I was a bit nervous.  The pre-epi oil did a great job of making this process almost pain free.  I read the most helpful reviews to get helpful tips in making this a success.  I will definitely be using this waxing kit on a regular basis!
B000UEAARO|5|My son is prone to diaper rash so we pour a packet into his bath at night.<br />I definitely notice an improvement in the rash area after use.<br />There is no scent to this packet and the oatmeal dissolves right into the water. This is a staple in our bathroom closet.
B007K6LID0|5|This stuff worked great for me. It left my mouth feeling actually clean. Not masked or covered up or burned, just clean. As for my sense of taste, it's still fine. Granted, I can still taste this stuff in my mouth for a good hour or so after I use it, but I don't \\"clean\\" my mouth then eat an hour later.( I use this after breakfast and after supper).<br /><br />The horror stories of burns, sores and icky film baffle me. Perhaps some folks just happen to be allergic to the active ingredient (Cetylpyridinuim chloride). It's really unfortunate that so many had bad experiences with this product. I had only positive results and will buy it as long as it's still available.
B0016ZMOT8|5|great product
B001EJOPXE|5|I really love this product.
B00O3IC6X4|5|Work great!  I am very happy with these spray bottles.
B0006GZCVK|5|I want people to realize 2 things :) -- First, sadly, if your hair is already reeeeaally damaged, no product will fix it. You're better off starting over with brand new healthy strands. This leads me to my second point, the average conditioner is loaded with synthtic oils and silicones that coat your hair shaft, making it appear magically softer, giving it more \\"slip\\" and a false sense of moisture retention. It's like someone with really bad skin layering on MAC makeup everyday rather than addressing their skin issues.... Then when you wash it all off, its back to damage city again. The gunk in conditioners that sticks to your hair does more harm than good in the long run! Please, please do your research if you are depending on a hair product *alone* to give you manageable hair...    Anywho, I love Aubrey's conditioners. This one is great!! I have 4a/b hair with some odd 3c in the back and I have found that Aubrey coconut fatty based conditioners are super duper moisturizing. I use this one on dry hair. I slather it on and let it sit for about 20 minutes, then I rinse it out and wash or co-wash in the shower. It makes my hair sooooo soft and tangle free. I also use the GBP conditioner in the same manner, which I love even more.
B000FQVQWK|5|I have used this product since 2010. I have very sensitive skin type, so I don't like foam type for cleansing make up. If you have sensitive skin type, then I recommend it.
B005MMDC5G|5|must have!
B000VOHH8I|5|My Thirty Year old son has been wearing this cologne for ten years and he wouldn't wear any other fragrance. Believe me, if you want to attract the girls, you couldn't choose better.
B00G3DMF9M|3|a bit tight for teeth
B00C8D9I6E|5|Best color choices soo sparkly and pretty and stays on until removed with a good primer
B000X9UI2I|5|I got this after surgery so I wouldn't have to bend down to pick things up.  It was great, picked up very small items, including a hearing aid battery, and is very lightweight.
B000VRTE9A|5|Exactly what you'd expect to be. To be fair, I don't have a huge base for comparison but It works really well for what I'd expect.
B005DKKBU6|4|The razor works quite well. It is also quite easy to clean.  The charge reminder is easy for me to follow.
B001D4CJ7E|4|I had to start doing my own nails because of money issues. This is the product that my Nail girl used.<br />I am not as good as her but it helps having a superior product to work with.
B001FWXIC4|5|I have used this cologne for about two years. Had to buy my last bottle here on amazon because they no longer sell it at Macys. Bottom line is if you want to smell like a real man, then buy this cologne. My girlfriend loves the way it smells, she says thats the way a man is supposed to smell. I've even had random woman compliment me on the way I smell. Do yourself a favor and buy it, you will not be disappointed.  But like I said this cologne is for real men not little boys.
B00005A443|1|I had to return this item, it did not live up to its reputation.
B006I79N4I|5|This toothbrush is velvety soft so as to limit enamel over-abrasion on the bristle end and sturdy, ergonomic, and slip resistant on the handle end. It is clever in it's design, beautifully simplistic but perfectly proportioned for a superior mechanical brushing technique.  It absolutely delivers on the promise of being a better brush for improved tooth and gum cleaning. The bristle tips are whisper thin, so thin they pass between the space between one's teeth and gums and sweep out caught food debris items that floss may fail to pick up or reach.<br />A dentist once told me to position the brush at a 45 degree angle then &#34;shimmy&#34; back and forth to lower the bristles on the edge I've just created with the angle under the bit of gum around the front of the tooth.  Finally I can follow this bit of advice because this is the only brush I have found that actual can work its way  inside that incredibly tiny gap.  It is the best toothbrush I have ever used, ever.
B004WGJIWO|5|Looks natural and doesn't tangle.
B006LAFU8U|4|I like it. They say this stuff does wonders for your hair. And from what I can tell, this is definitely authentic. It comes in a dark glass bottle and a plastic squeeze bottle. I love this. It is more than enough oil. I'm not a fan of the smell.. But that's how authentic oil smells so oh well. Definitely recommend for naturals and/or people trying to grow out their edges.
B00WJATKRS|3|It's nice and very curly really bouncy that is what I like.
B001KYVKL8|5|This is a hard to find item that my wife likes a lot and she was very happy to get some of it.
B001ECQ4Z8|5|I love this lotion and they don't sell it in stores any more. So I bought it here and they shipped it right away and I got it 3 days later (standard ground shipping). I'm so excited to start getting ready for summer! Amazing I might buy more now just so they don't run out.
B002H91BPA|5|I have used the Revlon Colorstay for years.  I'm not one who likes to be concerned about makeup once I've applied it in the morning.  The Colorstay has gone through a few changes, but that just means it has improved over the years.  Not as dry as it once was and the color choices are great.  Just know that once you put it on it's there to stay unless you dring something hot.  I don't drink coffee after my 2 cups in the morning so it works well for me.
B000LNB8HK|5|DOES THE JOB, KEEPS MY RAZORS AND CLIPS LIKE NEW
B001ET7A72|1|I really like the Method products - I use a lot of their soaps.  I found this square package on Amazon after being unable to find it anywhere for several years.  It turned out, the seller had some left over and ended up not charging me for it - it was old and there was only one instead of a box of 6 yadda yadda yadda.  So it's one of those products I really love but can't find anymore.  Welcome to old age, right?
B0067F998G|5|This is a super affordable pack of wig stands that work well in my closet with my collection of wigs.
B003BHF8NI|5|Love this makeup!!!
B00AVP37G8|3|The shipping is great but they are so cheap. The nail polish doesn't last on my nails. However, the colors are very pretty.
B003T7XP1W|4|I like this product. It's a good size bottle and therefore easy to carry around in my purse, it smells good but isn't too strong, it doesn't smell weird on you after you tan, and it's much cheaper on here than at the tanning salon where I first bought it where it cost $25. It does help maximize your tan, however it does not prevent getting burnt (which I didn't expect it to because it does not advertise this). Overall I was very happy and glad that I found it at a cheaper price so I was able to get two for the price I would have paid for one.

B00RC160KO|4|For around $40, you'll receive 5 wraps, which is a deal when compared to the price of other toning body wraps on the market. The wraps smell &#34;earthy,&#34; like an herbal tea with a hint of menthol or mint. They do not look particularly pleasant—it almost looks like a bunch of dirt was smeared onto a thin sheet of cloth. This did not deter me from trying the wrap, however.<br /><br />After applying the first wrap, I noticed that it wasn't going to stay on by itself. I had to use an ace bandage to secure the wrap to my body, especially since I planned on doing a lot of moving around (I'm a mother of two, so I can't sit still for very long). I wore the first wrap for two hours and I did notice results (as you can see in the two images I've provided). The difference is subtle, but I certainly noticed a change.<br /><br />Now, while I *did* see results, they didn't last very long. The morning after having worn the wrap, my stomach was back to its normal size. I do believe, however, that implementing these wraps into your healthy lifestyle routine could help you lose inches more quickly than with diet and exercise alone. However, because of the inability to stay in place without extra support and because of the short term of the results, I can only give this product four stars.<br /><br />* Product provided free of charge in exchange for an unbiased review.

B000FIH8XO|2|This cup is not worth $26 dollars
B001TVURXY|5|wife loves it.  Makes her hair look and feel good.  Price is a little higher than other conditioners but it works great.
B002H6YVVE|5|This lipstick's color and richness is outstanding!  I have always had a hard time finding lipstick I like, yet this one is great.
B00620XQ8K|5|Slipping and sliding all night lol love this product after purchase was shocked to see it on the local grocery store shelf haaaa haaaa
B002CMLHEC|5|Love the way it makes my hair feel
B000PAW9ZO|5|Absolutely loveeeeeee this soap! So glad I found it and even happier that it was shipped immediately. My entire family uses this so I wish there were more available to purchase. Very happy with the soap and how quickly it was received!
B008ZEAVCK|5|I know a lot of people said the scent didn't last long but I generally put in a cap full and I can still smell it every time I take my cover off my hot tub. I love this scent
B002S8VFHE|3|Smells funny.
B0092JXYP8|5|There's nothing like this product. I have fine curly hair and it feels amazing after I use this. It was delivered on time, I will order from them again.
B006KTTGC8|5|After requiring the services of an ophthalmologist twice in 6 months to remove  fibers from another \\"volumizing\\" mascara that got embedded under my upper eyelid, I gave up on having nice looking lashes.  My lashes are short and thin, and this product was recommended immediately when I asked at an Ulta store.  It is amazing.  It never runs, and fills out and lengthens lashes. It doesn't blob and is easy to apply.  It is hard to wash off, but that is fine with me.  I'm almost through one tube, I wear it daily, and I've had no issues with it at all.  My lashes look lovely and really define my eyes.  Thank you, Benefit!
B004OH74YK|5|I really like coconut body lotions.  This particular one is my favorite because I love limes so much, I figured it would be a good combo.<br />I was right.  You will really like the non greasy feeling plus the delightful fragrance.  It leaves a sweet but not too sweet scent to your skin.<br />My husband loves to smell it on me. Dogs too.  :-)
B001KYNX40|4|I like it, but got one complaint.  It tends to leave marks on your clothes.
B0056DGNHK|3|its just okay , glad i tried it out I dont like the smell of the cream I know its honey but I dont want to smell like that
B00AWS0PUU|5|Excellent product
B006Z8XU76|5|After being a hardcore tea drinker for many  years my teeth were looking stained and dull but after using Luster for a few weeks now my teeth are brighter and shinier!<br /><br />I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.
B003U7OYK2|5|I've used Olay for 25+ years to keep my 68-year old Irish skin soft & clear.
B00IO7MQ08|5|I think it worked pretty good.  My hair is thin and frizzy but this product makes it look smooth and silky.  It does not last for 7 days but it does work well.
B004WPGXMI|4|great product other than the tweezers are worthless, Brushes are good and the colors are good. I don't use the stencils.
B004GSX31K|3|I wouldn't say it's the best detangler out there but it does an ok job on my girls' hair.<br />My daughter's have thick and fine hair and this doesn't work all too well on either of them.<br />Before I purchased, I read reviews and watched video reviews and all made it seem like the stylists choice for detangling but I wouldn't say its the best out there and it still causes many tears while brushing their hair.<br />A positive.....it is easy for them to hold onto while brushing their hair.
B007W68ZCK|5|Thank you for the peppermint!
B00B9695M8|5|I ordered several sizes of similar colours as I always need a variation for the decorating I do.  Champagne is not one I think I will use often, but you never do know.  Awesome shine and catching of light as always.  And of course amazing amount for the price.
B00G5L85S2|5|Already noticing a difference with my kids teeth. Really great size for them.
B001NGF1EA|5|I love this product.  Soft styling and give hair a smooth shiny finish.  It smells great too!
B00BC3GVCA|5|The picture is pretty accurate to the color. I'm currently wearing it and I'm obsessed! I try different colors on all the time but I always come back to this one. LOVE!
B002UD52WQ|4|I've been happy with the shampoo in terms of results...but the packaging is horrible.  First, the box is<br />just stupid.  Second, the cap is overengineered for the worse.  I guess the idea is to make the bottle look bigger<br />as you're only getting 6 oz (most shampoos are at least 8).<br /><br />In an attempt to get all the shampoo out by turning it on its \\"head,\\" the next morning a good portion had leaked out. And it was snapped completely shut. Even if you keep it upright, over time you can see the clear cap filling up with wasted shampoo. Horrible design.  Just put a regular top on it, put it in a regular box, and pass the marketing savings on to the customer instead of trying to make it look like an 8 oz bottle of shampoo with only 6 oz's in it. I'm curious if this is happening to other users.  It's been the same for every bottle I used, to the point where now I take a full bottle, take the top off, and transfer it into another shampoo bottle with a regular snap top, throwing the useless empty bottle in the trash. Lastly, you really only need one application.  I use a little more than a quarter sized amount, lather and scrub, leave it on while I wash the rest of my body, and then rinse my head last.  It still works great. If you want to do two apps, just do the first with a tea tree shampoo, then hit it with the DS for 3-5 mins.  The drops are what really matters.
B000MAPB6Q|2|First of all, it has questionable ingredients with no dental benefits; no fluoride, no xylitol, and it contains parabens - that go in your mouth! Ew. Anyway, I tried Oasis mouthwash after a reviewer said it seemed to last longer than Biotene. This mouthwash really burned and seems to stimulate less natural &#34;mouth moisture&#34;.<br /><br />My mouth gets very dry at night and I'm trying to prevent cavities but I have a sensitive, dry mouth from Lupus and medications. Oasis burned and without cavity fighting ingredients, it seems pretty worthless. I'll stick with Biotene Mouthwash and Toms of Maine Juicy Mint Fluoride Rinse for Kids. They are both gentle and effective.
B00SLEM2SU|5|fashion fair products are the best i love the product mainly because it leaves a natural airbrushed look it doesnt look heavy weighed down at all and it lasts all day....
B005G0T87K|3|The bronze is kind of runny and the red is ok.I contacted the seller and they sent an immediate free replacement. The bronze is better. Its a good value for the price.
B00DO40YXM|1|Clumpy. not happy with
B0018A32XS|5|I love it. Nice close shave. Great price. Delivered on time. Replaced an old electric shaver that I had for years. Love the cordless feature.
B00AFSJXHS|3|The paint do their job.  But I'm not happy with the tiny size of the containers.  I want bigger tubes but not too big at the same time.
B004TH6Q9Y|5|I really love this cleanser. Takes my make up off easily. Just be gentle when washing because its like a scrub. Will purchase again
B00JZ3SNR0|4|Perfect for Mac prolongwear eye shadows, mineralize eye shadows and pressed pigments. The slots are too big for the regular size shadows.
B002QAR8QG|5|Smells good. Bought it for my hubby and he loved it! The price is just great too. Would definitely recommend this cologne.
B004Y9LNEK|5|Perfect
B003CJ0FJC|5|Love love this shade!
B000F65JSC|4|Consumer Reports rates this well. I like it, reduces the blu-ish under my eyes, keeps the skin tight. Very good stuff
B004S0C66Y|1|It doesn't work and has a funky smell.  I have them wear the seat belts constantly runs and I could not stand the smell.
B005VI0K4C|4|I have been using 911 Emergency Hair Treatment Leave-in Conditioner Original Formula for well over a decade.  I used to purchase it at Walmart for many years but they stopped stocking it a long time ago.  I started buying this item at the beauty supply store and then they no longer carried it so I purchased it at Amazon at a much higher price for a smaller bottle.  The product is great but pricey.  I recommend it.
B001SJ9NDW|5|I had read about all the wonderful things emu oil could do, so I took a chance on finding out what it could do for my hair, specifically my hairline.  When I first got it, I used it for about 3-4 days consistently. Then forgot about it for a week or two.  Well, during one of my hair days (wash,dc,seal,and twist), I notice that the one area of my hairline seemed fuller, well, it had started to fill in!!!!  I knew it had to be the emu oil because nothing else has ever worked.  My hair seems ODDLY stronger and thicker along my hairline. Well, needless to say, I have been using it daily, and I hope to see continued thickness and fullness around my once scarce hairline.
B000AUTHEA|5|i love this stuff! works great on my rough course hair, when im done flat ironing its shiny and straight! my hair no longer frizzes out either... and it sprays like a hair spray can... other bottles are like squirt bottles and dont give even coverage. swear by this stuff.
B00E80TIR4|1|This soap has done nothing for my complexion. It did however give me super dry skin -___-
B0072FTOW6|1|Actually made my face more oily than it already was.
B00JRGQ09S|5|Really works, removes all dark spots.
B00DA1WYQY|4|First of all this wig came in super fast. It was supposed arrive the 19th and it arrived today. Secondly, the colour is vibrant which is beautiful. Thirdly, the wig is super soft and does not tangle for me. My only problems are that the wig is a bit thin and you can see the lace on top but you easily fix that with a hat. Also this isnt a huge problem but the bangs were long, so I had to trim it a bit. but other than that this wig is amazing and I highly recommend it!
B00D0NN7I6|5|This polish is amazing!
B000AA5VF4|4|I like it. Makes nails feel nice.
B008PJUVUC|5|These are great. The heel has a jelly, waxed feel. Great to wear while sleeping!  Leaves no residue.  Looks like picture.
B00GRM6JK0|4|It was good!
B005HIH7YM|4|I have very curly,  somewhat frizzy course hair about to the length of my mid back.  This works very well on my hair type and leaves it soft and clean. The smell is awesome and stays in my hair for a while.  I can't say I recommend it since everyones hair is different.  My sister tried it and she did not care for it as much. Her hair is thinner and straighter then mine.  She did love the smell though.  She prefers Wen, I prefer this one.  To each their own, you just have to try it for yourself to see what works for you.  It is a cream like conditioner, but cleans your hair.  I still use a leave in conditioner for my hair or gel depending on what I am going to do with my hair.  It doesn't leave your hair greasy or anything, their is nothing like that to it.  It has the consistency of a hair conditioner.  You do have to use a lot though, depending on the length of your hair.  Either way you have to use a generous amount.
B003TO3UG0|5|I love this stuff the only thing I wish it was waterproof because I go to the gym after work and sweat a lot. I love the way the brush seperates your lashes and it does not clump up. The best I have ever used.
B000I5HJ2Y|5|She uses this thing all the time, I got her 2 packs and she orgasms when it touches her face, so that's a 5 star.
B00FD3VCKG|1|I was very dissatisfied with the product.  The scent was not pleasant; it was as if it was an expired item.  Maybe that is why the price was so great.
B0002TSD08|5|Love it!
B001Z6N80C|1|Don't think it was an original body work product. Didn't smell like the original shower gel.
B001ET7BL2|5|First bought at harvest foods based on yummy smell in health section, lasted 4 ever. Reordered a 2pack on here. Bought & forgot to use for massages, but now astounded that over a year after ditching lotions w/additives and switching to pure coconut oil, plus pure vitamin e & sunflower oil for face & diet supplements this stuff has them all languishing on my shelf. Plus flaxseed oil. Was too lazy to get up & fetch my coconut oil so read my massage oil ingredients, doh.<br /><br />Still stable, non-rancid, stored in closet, but prolly more potent if used fresh.
B00D3SJHIC|5|Great deal and great product! It's Bed Head...of course it's great! Smells amazing. Made my hair feel soft and smooth. I have thick, color-dyed hair.
B000QV2PZ6|5|This sponge is awesome. It holds up well and does not disintergrate. Just needs a little soap or bath wash to go a long way.
B0052JN7XG|5|I am very happy with my purchase. The toothbrush does all it's said to do and does it very well.
B003I964VO|5|Product is perfect.  Same one that I buy at a store but saved me the trip.
B000YJ2SLG|3|It's a good lotion, not greasy, and doesn't leave a film on the skin but it hasn't been as good of a lotion for exzema as I was hoping for.
B00I6DWU60|5|This primer does everything a primer should on my lids: it locks my eyeshadow into place and keeps it from creasing. Plus, it's just $1 on the ELF website, you just can't go wrong with this. This works for me just as well as the Urban Decay Primer Potion, but I'd say that I have normal lids. If you have oily lids, it may not work the same for you, but for the price I still think it's worth a try. Highly recommended!
B00MMKAM5E|4|Works well for bumpy arms, but you have to use it every day (hence the word &#34;daily&#34; in the name).
B0015KHMRS|5|Nice set. I got this set for Christmas and use it often. The only complaint is the batteries do not last all that long, but that is no real problem.<br />Nice to take on a trip and use in a hotel room before a big meeting.
B00DEJWA2A|1|Three coats and didn't last one whole day without coming off.  Love the color.
B005DIQD00|3|This shave soap produces an adequate lather, nice results, no complaints with how it works. But I spent a couple three days wondering where that weird smell around the bathroom counter was coming from, like maybe some nail polish remover had spilled or something. Then I lean over, sniff the shave cup, and yup, that's it. Sharp soap/chemical smell, nothing like sandalwood, and no way I'm going to use this stuff up just on smell alone.
B009W4D64C|5|My sales agent who sold me the original refused to believe me when I told him the price of these replacements. I bought them with my Respironics easylife cushion sets. Well I have them at less then $15 a set. while they go for over $ 50 a set in Malaysia.
B0009ET6CK|4|Nice night cream. Not greasy which is important to me. Will buy again.
B00D2V18WS|5|Product arrived as described.
B0009VDBX8|2|So I was in love with this Green Tea Rinse, but then I looked it up on skin deep, and it's not as safe as you would think it is being organic, there's still additives in it that are not good for you, and I switched to another all natural product, and it works better and is safer than this one.  Disappointing, but I guess it's still better than that alternatives that contain Sodium Laural Sulfates.
B001SAOHXW|2|The body spray is really nice, but the bottle sprayer totally sucks!  If it works at at all, it will get clogged within a couple of days.  I've put it in a cheap spay bottle from DollarTree and it's fine, but not very convenient.
B005IQ2BH6|5|I love the scent of Joop.  This was bought for a friends upcoming birthday.  I'll 5 star it 'cause I love the scent !!!!!
B00FS6NAL2|5|:)
B007IFY254|1|We put them on my sons jacket before school this morning and one if them broke by lunchtime. Poor quality and returning. Will be looking for a difference mitten clip.
B000RWG68G|4|I just got this in the brun shade and so far so good I got it at my local duane reade for 30 incl tax so its a bit pricey but so far so good it feels nice on and the color is nice cos its very sheer but not overly shiny it tastes good cos it doesnt have a strong scent or anything crazy   I am excited for it to be my only go to lipgloss and hopefully duane reade and amazon will both keep carrying it   wish it plumped too but ill go to wexler or lip venom for that
B002ESO5Z2|2|It has a nice fragrance, but it doesn't smell like lily of the valley.<br />I wouldn't buy it again.<br />Thanks
B0043OWJG2|5|great product
B001E6VHUQ|5|I have used these blades and razor for over 50 years. I have tried other razors and blades, but always come back to Schick injectors. The purchase process was easy, with the blades being shipped as presented.
B004AI97MA|5|used this my entire pregnancy, 2 a day, not one stretch mark!!! did you hear me, not one!!! this product delivers but must use twice a day, can get expensive, but it's worth it, once that kid pops out and your belly return to normal! can't rave about this product any more!
B00SI5EULY|5|Exxential received was what I expected.  Would recommend quality
B008QUOE1M|5|I have been using this for about a month, and I really see a difference in my skin. It looks and feels healthier.
B0052JN7XG|5|cool
B00BBF4OR8|5|Excellent product, same quality as the one I used to buy directly from Brazil. Even included the gloves, will keep buying here every month or so.
B002NI1ZTW|5|I really love this carrying case. It protects the bottles for the cabinet. I've packed it with my bags kind of bundled in my clothing. Even being bounced around for the airplane ride, everything stayed in tact.
B00GWU9Y7C|4|Have tried 2 or 3 different type pillows for our jacuzzi bathtub.<br /><br />This is by far the best one!<br /><br />Dries quickly, vert comfy!
B00MF2GWGW|2|It was nice while it lasted. It broke after wearing only one time. I guess you get what you pay for.
B00GY5XVWY|5|Love the scent of this one.
B000C1VSUI|5|I was afraid to buy a cologne without smelling it first.  I saw the great reviews and decided to take a chance since it is so cheap vs. department stores.  Now, I'm becoming more and more addicted to the fragrance. Great compliments whenever I go to social gatherings is a+++++
B0082BX3IA|5|I was very happy with the purchase of the hair bow clips.  They come in so many different colors that you have a bow to match just about every outfit.  And the price was perfect!  At the local store, I would have only gotten two bows for the price I paid for 12 bows!!
B005HYNI30|5|Fixed my terrible super deep ingrowns completely but I have to keep up the treatments to maintain results. Diluted this with water at first, but used full strength the third time and it was great. Haven't tried other brands but this worked and is cheap so I will definitely rebuy
B00CZ4WRQ4|2|Not as opaque as I would like.
B0098N94S4|5|I started coloring/highlighting my hair at the age of 18 and now I am 42. I do not even know the color of my natural hair. The first 15 years was strictly bleach blonde which does a number on the condition of your hair. The last 9 years have been more foil highlights & darker colors. I also have natural curly hair that I have used a straightner on for years. With the stress I have put my hair under, I have searched for the best shampoo & conditioners to make my hair healthier. I was introduced to the Wella Brilliance over a year ago by a new hair stylist. It is a fabulous product. It smells delicious, & makes my hair the softest, bounciest & healthiest it has ever been and holds the rich color of reds that I am coloring my hair these days. So if you have colored, over processed, dry brittle hair, this is the product for you.
B0049RBZRC|5|Great.
B00ARF428O|5|Got this as a present for my husband. He absolutely loves it! He uses all the time to trim and groom himself. His feedback to me was &#34;this is a very slick, manly man present.&#34;
B00CR736RS|4|I have dark and naturally kinky hair. I use this when I straighten my hair so it lasts a few extra days before I wash it. It does the job. I prefer it to Batiste for my hair type because it does not leave white residue in your hair at all and it does not make you hair feel hard and residuey. Just spray at the roots and comb it out. It smells good too. Not like a nursing home. Would highly recommend.
B00LNOV8JO|5|Rosehip oil is a part of my daily anti aging routine  and this 4oz bottle is a great value /money saver! My order arrived -securely packed-within the week and exactly as advertised. High quality organic product and professional sellers!
B002ZG8DJW|5|We used to buy JR Watkins Body Oils at Whole Foods but they stopped carrying them in our area. So here we are, loading up at Amazon.    If you like a warm, relaxing bath in the winter, don't take a bubble bath - it's far too drying. But two or three capfuls of JR Watkins Body Oil - any one of their bath oils, we have them all - and you are set for a nice, relaxing, long lounging, but non-drying bath. (Nope, I don't work for them.)    My wife uses their oils in the shower almost like a body wash - her favorite is Lavender but she uses them all.    Enjoy!
B005C2NAE4|2|I find this soap to be a little hard to rinse out but my husband swears by it. The bar soap leaves color on your washrags and towels... for a shampoo or shower soap it is okay and smells great, for the bath it isn't as good.
B004U6TMCM|3|Was not impressed by any change after one jar.
B001FB5IMI|5|Soft and delicate, does the job, doesn't leave a residue.
B0019LUN7Y|1|This product is not the real thing!<br />I figure this out quickly because I had an Enjoy Keratin Smoothing Treatment and it just wasn't lasting.<br />I narrowed this down to this shampoo and conditioner being fake and imitation Enjoy shampoo.<br />Do not buy!
B000BP0NN8|5|My wife loves this powder.  She used to get it from a local health food store but they no longer carry it.
B001DKRM8O|5|This is a wonderful mirror. It's very light and easy to store. The tiltable mirror makes doing your makeup anywhere a snap. The only thing to be aware of which has already been mentioned is that the bulbs do tend to heat up so you will definitely feel some warmth while putting on your makeup. If this doesn't bother you (as it did not bother me) this is a great choice.
B00ARF42D4|5|Blade adjustment easy to use- no bulky attachments, lightweight
B001DKMY9Q|5|The high praise from other reviewers about this shaver was if anything, understated. The shaver gave me a close, smooth shave with no irritation. And the trimmer which wasn't mentioned by others, is also a nice addition to keep my sideburns even. The ergonomic friendly handle makes this a really good buy. It is easy to maneuver, especially for those hard to shave hairs under the nose and between the chin and the neck. I used to use a Braun 5500. I don't know why I waited so long to change over. I have had to clean it once so far; and it was relatively easy if you use some sink water. I suggest that you dry it with a hair dryer, rather than a dry cloth suggested by the handbook, because moisture remained for one day.
B000WB4NIW|5|I bought this product because of its high rating for UV protection on EWG's website.  My child tends to freckle, and I have tried all types of chemical and natural sunscreens including California Baby.  So far, I think this product has been the most effective in protecting my child's skin.  This sunscreen creates a barrier on the skin which is rich and emollient because of the various oils.  I tried it on myself as well and don't mind the texture, although some people may prefer something with a lighter feel.  I will definitely continue to use this product.
B007762NQE|2|Ive been buying Vetiver for years and they recently have increased the price by 100% they have lost a loyal customer!
B0054Y3S0G|3|Coverage was great but Color was a lot darker than I expected I used 4m (dark mohogony) so I thought the 4n would be a chocolate brown but it came out a dark brown.
B000GT0V3G|5|I love this fragrance but I'd recommend getting the smallest bottle possible.  I bought a 3oz before and had it for a while and eventually the fragrances separated.  It smelled like straight curry.
B001G8PDMU|2|Im always looking for a good review to help me decide if I will purchase the item,here is mine,I recieved this item and was happy about the results,but for the money I paid I could not believe how very little was in the bottle,it seemed even less than the 0.5  they said was in it,,by the 8 th day of using this item I was hard tapping the bottom of it to get it to the bottom of the bottle to come up through the pump,,questionable of the legal amount put in,
B00347FTXE|5|My second set. a mast for traveling, very juicy, so use first on your neck.
B002Z85VJK|3|A minor quibble, SELLER please take NOTE. I didn't receive 25 brands or even 50 razor blades. I got 48 blades, divided among 20 brands...in a number of cases I got four blades of the same type...Sharks, Astras, Nacets and Bluebirds. That's not serious...I can't sample every blade on Earth, but I do slightly resent being shortchanged to the tune of two blades. Otherwise the selection looks just as advertised...there were four different kinds of Lords; Feathers; Treets; Gillette Nacets, Super Blues, 7 O'clocks; Big Bens; two kinds of Super-Maxs, etc. I look forward to giving them all a thorough try over the next few months. Let's see...even if I shaved every day, which I don't, and used each blade four days, it would take me six months to get through them all! I'll report back on my progress, the condition of my face, etc.
B000SSG0EE|1|This tool doesn't really work at all. I was disappointed with it, and found that it just leaves circular marks on your face, but does not actually remove blackheads or blemishes. I wouldn't waste your money.
B008FPZUXY|5|The best color they ever created! a mix of brown and peacock blue with a shimmer! Gorgeous! Can't seem to find it anywhere anymore...? Please URBAN DECAY, bring it back!!!!!
B0011DP7Q2|5|nice soap
B0079R6BD2|1|My eyes are puffed up and I feel I am allergic to something in the shampoo. It is too late for a refund so buyer beware. I really gave this a try and the only thing that is keeping my eyes allergic that I am doing different is the shampoo.
B00CNTJHQO|4|I purchased this shampoo after reading other reviews.  I have color treated hair and had difficulties finding an sulfate free shampoo that would help with my dandruff.  I heard all positive reviews about this product, and I must say, they were all correct.  The product has  helped my scalp tremendously and I would recommend this to others!  The only issue I have with the shampoo is the smell.  I don't particularly like the fragrance it has.  It is an all natural shampoo and it definitely smells that way.  This really has no affect on the quality of the shampoo, so I just deal with it! =)
B004R7X536|2|to short does not come with belt which is shown returned it
B0058SXKSS|5|non greasy, great protection. Worked for beach vacation....protected about an 1hr before reapplying (and the hubby burns easy). Did not wash off easy with water contact or sweating when doing water sports.<br /><br />Three came in pack. Perfect size for travel.
B00HDL5VA8|5|First of all, I want to tell anyone who's reading that this stuff smells absolutely AMAZING! Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell fantastic. It says in the description that it is &#34;citrus&#34; scented, but it does have floral undertones, in my opinion. It honestly smells very similar to Victoria's Secret &#34;Lovespell&#34; perfume and that is my favorite fragrance of all time. However, unlike &#34;Lovespell,&#34; this product is made with natural ingredients.<br /><br />As for how well it works on my hair, well, it makes my hair super soft and shiny. My husband even uses it on his beard and looks SO much healthier. I highly, highly recommend this product! A little goes a long way, so don't worry about the price, because chances are, you'll be using one bottle for a month or more.<br /><br />* Product provided for review without cost. All opinions are my own.
B003WR3QSG|5|No complaints. I mean it's a brush and hasn't fallen apart or anything.
B005G62P92|5|Sturdy and looks good. The edge (rubber part) was slighly damaged in shipping and not worth the headache of getting a replacement. A little super glue and couldn't even tell. Great for the price!
B002H3DUVE|5|I have thin, straight hair that droops in the humidity.  This is the best shampoo to fight humidity.  I use it all year round.
B005ALWE1M|1|It took forever. I seriously did not gave time to wait. Don't buy it'll just take forever for such a small stupid thing
B00O2OHOBI|5|I had tried so many products which promised killer smiles and pearly whites. Instead I received painful teeth and glue that took forever to get off.  After complaining to my hygienist,  she recommended this product saying that it was not false advertisement and will be a safe and efficient way to whiten my teeth. I went on amazon immediately on my phone and saw the discounted price and had to buy it. Within a few days this product became my daily beauty regime. I feel confident and beautiful. I flash my killer smile without thinking twice. I can tell you that this product is worth a try and can lighten your teeth a few shades.
B0049LUI9O|5|This product works great and affordable!  It's a little lighter weight than I expected.  It takes batteries which is a little different than the rechargeable one I once used.
B0067F8BBM|5|I am extremely pleased with these brushes. The quality of the brushes are way beyond what I'd expected. The shipping was very fast. The product was well packaged. I've used them several times and have washed them and they are holding up very nicely. HIGHLY recommend these brushes.
B002DV8IXA|4|I purchased this as a gift for a friend who has a black Labrador Retriever and he absolutely loved it!<br />We put the light out in the yard to charge it and that evening it lit up perfectly.  My friend brought the dog/light into the house and it stayed lit all night long.  It was a good choice for a gift to a dog lover and my only regret is that it isn't larger.  I highly recommend it.
B00I3SKUFG|5|I highly recommend this bleach and wish I'd of known about it rather than wasting my time with other bleaches in the past! It doesn't have a strong, terrible odor, it's blue bleach so it helps fight those brassy tones, it lifted more in two times than any other bleach I've ever used.. Other bleaches I would've needed about 3-4 applications (on my already dyed black hair- I like to switch between black to blonde and anywhere in between!) to get it the color of the inside of a banana peel! One of the things that I absolutely do love about this particular bleach too, is the silky feeling it gives your hair- I suppose from the panthenol (spelling?) it contains that it says conditions it. And it does. Which is definitely a surprising feeling to have after using something so damaging! Totally love this product and even if it's a few dollars more than others, it's well worth it! The picture is after 2 uses and I plan to do one more.. After some healing time ☺️. I'll also post my before! Also, I used a color remover, &#34;ColorOops&#34;, to try to get some of the black dye out before I started bleaching.. Works great too if you're in a similar situation.
B009GIOVLG|3|Worked great and really cleans your pores. I had make up on, id remove it with a make up wipe and feel clean, but when i used this product it really cleaned my skin. Id see make up on the bristles and its awesome. It worked for about 5 months, and then i hung it up with the strap and it turned on by itself and just runs and runs. It wont shut off unless i take the batteries out. Im real sad about it but it did pretty good overall.
B00C2BHZD0|5|Love this brush!!!  No hair ripping or tearing out... amazing!
B0013NB6WE|2|My dentures are a little over a month old, and I know my jaw is still shrinking, but this stuff should have alot better hold then it does. Especially as I also have a layer of Cushion Grip under it, as a liner.Cushion Grip works good to tighten up the denture and seals out food, but has little holding power.<br />But, this powder should do the holding, and it does, until I eat something, then, it's coming out. Well, the bottom does. The top is ok. So, this is another waste of money. I have the tubes of Polident and Fixodent, and these companies are simply stealing money. They know all these products are weak and will not hold up to any real amount of pressure from real foods, like meat and bread, and vegis. It works all day with oatmeal, mashed potatoes, and pudding, but I can gum that stuff without teeth!<br /><br /> If any company ever really gets serious and makes a denture adhesive that actually works all day, with one application, they will be zillionaires overnight. When someone makes a product that actually holds like superglue, and can stand up to all foods, they will have a huge following instantly. Hey Merch, are you listening? Why not add some adhesive to your Cushion Grip?
B002AV3996|5|help with so many things!
B00CHRJZ4G|5|That was fast!!! Thanks
B00GXFS6U2|5|Combined with Fractionated Coconut oil and it work amazing. Would definitely order again in the near future. Great for sensitive skin.
B009GHHW5Y|3|Packaging needs to be better.There was some leakage when I received it.Seems to have an instant effect on hair ,as it is softer and more manageable now.
B000VWZ04I|5|This product may not be for everybody but it fit my specific needs. My hair was free from chlorine and the like after using.
B002RL8IWW|4|This is my second jar of Retinol Day Cream.  I am usually allergic to moisterizers but this has not given me any problems.  It's not oily on my skin and I am able to wear makeup over it.  Pros:  My skin looks great and the product is inexpensive.  Cons:  I wish it didn't have a scent, but it isn't that bad.  This is the reason for 4 stars.
B000052ZB8|4|I've been using this for years because it is SO light weight and doesn't feel greasy.  However, they only make one for oily skin and one for combo skin.  Unfortunately, its just not cutting it for me in the winter. I just switched to Cereve for the winter months.  Both are comparable in weight and price per ounce, but CereVe is keeping the flakiness down on my forehead and cheeks in the winter much better than this.
B00CDD2GV8|5|I was using a Lumene pencil forever- and could no longer find it.  I did a lot of research to find this one.  All the 'cheaper' pencils I had tried were just that.  The sharpeners would gobble them up, I'd end up trying to apply pieces of wood instead of liner.  This pencil save the day- glides on easy but not greasy.  Higher quality so when I need to sharpen I lose barely anything and it stays sharpened (not like the cheap ones where one application brings you down to splinters again).  It has the brush on the end which was a requirement because who wants more pieces to keep track of?  Great product.
B000SMOHHW|5|I ordered this sleep mask for my two year old for a road trip. Fit snug and stayed in place. The straps are elastic and could stretch for adult easily. Color was same as pictured and everything.
B000BHKBGK|5|If you get Cranker Sores - this is the toothpaste for you.
B00AMMYOY4|4|Very nice
B00GTC1JVM|5|The smelling is not good. But that is just me
B006ZYSWFK|5|Cant say much else about these other than they are good quality.  I have no complaints. And are a good price.
B000ELP5KA|4|Good
B00538TSMU|2|They don't look real at all, complete plastic and thick, better for cosplay or costume instead of everyday life. Really difficult to stick on as well, they are so plasticy and hard and non-flexibile that they will poke you in your eye.
B0067H6EGY|5|Personally, I love this shampoo. I have really thick hair and I am accustomed to washing my hair daily. I actually use Aveeno conditioner on top of this since the shampoo+conditioner is not enough to leave my hair the way I like it. I love the smell and the way my hair feels when its dry. It doesn't leave it too oily like other shampoos / conditioners. It leaves it juuuust right :)
B000YZ4MSC|5|Read the reviews and order it. The best hair spray ever!!!!! I can comb thru my hair after spraying and no build up.  I have never had that.  It holds the hair in place and a little goes a long way.  Buy it you won't be sorry.
B00NES8D7W|5|Very nice, almost no smell (a plus in my book), very useful as a massage oil.
B0085YKRSI|5|My favorite color! China Glaze is by far my favorite nail polish, it holds up well with very little to no chipping.
B000BXHDUG|5|this cream is so nice and thick.  It really moisturizes my babies skin without being greasy.  It is non-irritating and makes my babies ezcema not flare up. Better than any other creams I have tried.
B004N7DQHA|5|I love this Epsom Salt.  The grains are fine and it dissolves quickly in water.  I take baths 3-4 nights per week and add about 2 cups o these epsom salts & about 1 cup of baking soda.  It helps me sleep and relax.  Others recommend buying Safe Step (ice de-melter) to add Magnesium to your bath.  It is cheaper that way, but I really prefer these fine grains.
B00DLKQWIU|5|This case is wonderful. It has a sturdy canvas inside and is plastic outside to protect from water. I love it. There s enough room for my Clasonic and charger and even an extra brush. Great for vacation and great at home for storing my extras.
B001BHUFTW|4|Very nice to have a case for the glass nail file.
B007SNGSFS|5|These cartridges are genuine Braun replacements, and come packaged in a sturdy shipping carton that compactly stores them until they are needed. These are a great value, and help keep the head clean and fresh. Highly recommended!
B000O7K9HI|4|I just got this a few days ago. I also ordered DrEmu for my face. So it is nice I can kind of compare the 2 products at least on how it looks.<br />This one is more of an oil greasy feel than the DrEmu. So I am using this one (which is less expensive) on my body parts and DrEmu on my face and neck only.<br />I possibly put too much on my face?? But my skin doesn't seem to absorb it as well as the DrEmu.<br />The oil inside of Thunder's bottle is like a thin creamy lotion. So I spreads out nice for large body parts.<br />Won't know how well it works for a couple of months. Husband is also trying on hair line too. I am also putting on son's dermitis on back of arms. So we will see!
B006W44GYE|3|Somewhat disappointed.  I love  Shiseido, they have terrific products.  But so far I don't really notice any difference in my dark circles under my eyes.  But I'll keep using it to see if it just takes more time to start working.  Just not what I hoped for.
B00TPFW220|4|A cheap low quality but sturdy canvas-like bag for holding a small hairdryer.  It's large enough to be overwhelmingly large for a travel hairdryer, but too small to reasonably fit a full sized hairdryer.  The bag itself is utilitarian and thin, but works to keep the cord from a small hairdryer from becoming unwound and mixing with the rest of your luggage.
B00GUNYDAE|5|I am amazingly surprised and very pleased with this product. The heal socks have really worked on my dry heel skin! Very satisfied! Thank you very much<br /><br />I am surprising pleased with the heel socks! They have worked great on my dry heel skin. I have used them a few times, but the first night I used them I noticed a remarkable difference in my skin. My skin was softer and they keep improving with wear! Thank so very much! :o)<br /><br />!
B0015RZA8E|5|Smells fine, no white residue, keeps me dry, no itching or bumps
B004L4EING|2|I bought the DE razor and this set from Target for a total of $45. On my first shave and use of brush to lather half of the Bristles were on my face.<br /><br />Literally my first use of it!!! Looking into different brushes to use with the bowl and Shaving cream.
B004BTDXUA|5|Great gift set and glad it was available as my husband could not find it at any of the military base stores
B0091JL3IO|5|Iam a Flight Attendant. my wife bought it for me for xmas one year.. i love it, i dont have to carry the whole bottle.<br />iam gone for about 3-4 days a week.. i only use around half of the bottle.  its so easy to refill.  and for the price. $5.00 Dlls its worth it.
B004BWPQS4|5|I have done A LOT of research on facial products. I have used and continue to use Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, Phloretin, E, Retina-A, LaGratiae's Lift, but nothing was giving me that &#34;wow, I LOOK different&#34; appearance.  I am only 34, and am an advocate of preventative maintenance, so maybe that &#34;WOW&#34; factor isn't going to be as obvious with the other products because maybe I am maintaining and preventing-- but I still wanted something that made me feel like my money was well-spent and something I could SEE. So, I did a lot of research on this product, read the trials, read the reviews, researched the ingredients etc. I purchased this April 6, Today is June 26. I waited to give a review after using it to give honest results. I can say this: This product has shrunken my pores, my skin IS smoother, it doesn't necessarily make it brighter (vit. c will) it just makes it look smoother, finer, and as if I had a laser procedure. Just as it promises. I can tell you, you don't find a lot of products that actually deliver what they say they will. It's empty promises of &#34;youth! No lines! Miracle Overnight!&#34; and you're left waiting to actually SEE the results. You can check my other reviews. I do not work for this company, and am RARELY an impressed buyer. But this product turned me from skeptic to regular consumer. If you buy the trial products, 4 of the small bottles lasted me 2.5 months. well worth $5 a bottle. Do research on the sellers, some are selling at $10 a bottle and you can find it cheaper.
B000MFN0HI|5|This stuff does exactly what it says it will do.  It covers the red areas on my face and leaves a smooth silky finish on my skin that makes my makeup go on flawless. A little will go a long way.  My skin is prone to breakouts, and I was hesitant at first to try this.  No breakouts, at all-NOT ONE PIMPLE!<br />Confession: after it ran out, I did buy the smash box green primer.  It was $10 more and the bottle was smaller. After the first week using it, I got breakouts all over my face and my makeupe looked &#34;cakey&#34;.  I lost almost $40 throwing that tube of smash box away...but my face thanked me for going back to Bodyography!<br />LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!
B000P22TIY|5|Good for less than $15. Best out of all Nautica I tried.
B00FA1TUCS|4|It worked better when I used in tray fit to my mouth, my clear retainer, if you must know. It didn't damage the retainer or stain it, so I guess that's ok. My dentist said not to use anything not endorsed by the ADA, so I'm a bit concerned. Also that my tooth broke around the same time I was using this, which the dentist didn't think was related, just coincidental. I have thin enamel. My daughter said she read online that you shouldn't bleach so much if you have this issue. Just caution. Otherwise, my teeth definitely whiter and I drink coffee and a bit of diet cola every day. I'm gonna check with dentist whether this particular product is OK to use. First I have to get tooth fixed though.
B00B9V9ASM|4|Nice shampoo with conditioner. So far, it has not caused any excessive dryness in my hair. Giving it 4 stars as the conditioner part is nothing fancy. My hair don't feel &#34;well conditioned&#34; after its use. If you are looking to save time and provide &#34;some&#34; conditioning to your hair, this product is good. However, if you are looking for a &#34;healthy shine&#34;, you should use conditioner separately.
B00L84DK9K|5|This product is wonderful.  I see a big different in my skin. I will br buying this product again.
B00HERO526|5|Cute cuff
B001LPC164|5|Good product at a great price.
B002HNQW0U|5|This was a blind buy and I can tell it was a great deal, it scents is quite different from any other I've ever smelled. 5 stars
B002HK2GWG|5|It's great having all the tools in one compact piece, and each one is effective, and ergonomically easy to use.  I bought a second one to keep in my travel bag.
B001TSB9MA|3|I do not know any body who uses a hair brush cleaner but if you buy a great brush that  you need to care for it properly.
B00JZFB13G|1|Much smaller then I expected to be , in the picture it looks big but once I recived it its so much smaller...
B00EZL4060|4|The product was delivered in a timely fashion.  Box was slightly smashed, but tube of product was fine.  I am currently using the serum, will wait to see the results.
B00EQ2LEBM|4|Glowzone Super Berry Eye Serum is a nice eye serum that helps with puffiness, dark circles, bags, and fines lines and wrinkles. It uses antioxidants and peptides that are known for their anti-aging properties. It definitely helps with puffiness and dark circles, which I suffer from. I received this in exchange for my honest review.
B001UTK76C|5|Love this stuff! Doesn't streak or stain. Looks natural. Never orange. Smells great and leaves skin soft. Can't think of one negative thing about it.
B00EOH77CE|5|My wife and I wanted to spice up are anniversary weekend and boy did this do the trick. I really like how it has no strong sent to it.
B00J44UVZW|5|I thought about buying this for a few months and decided to finally do it. I picked this brand because the bottle really stood out to me and they had a good price. I never really had that many wrinkles but my skin is always so very dry. This product claims that it helps to retain moisture in your skin so I knew this is exactly what I needed. Of course I was skeptical but it actually did have an effect on me. For the first week I barely felt any difference but then I noticed my hands were not as dry as they would usually be. After three weeks my skin barely feels dry. I used to slather on lotion 10 times a day but now I just do it once or twice. Not bad! I'm surprised it worked honestly.
B001EWETBY|5|I found these clearanced out at Walgreen's & what a bargain I got!  I love them!  I seriously have a chapstick addiction, always have to have something on my lips and this stuff is wonderful!  Very smooth and creamy, nice light scent ... my whole family uses it!  As a bonus, it's completely organic!!  Definitely recommend & can't wait to try out some of the other flavors!
B000MS5M3A|5|My favorite lotion ever!!!  It smells heavenly.
B00LITWPQE|1|You will need other floss to get this stringy, fuzzy rope out of your teeth
B004SSEHFE|5|This color is more pink than it looks online.  I knew that, as I had seen it at the salon, so that's fine by me, but just to let you know.<br />It lasts about as well as the other gel polishes.
B00CA83WRS|5|Great product. Covers up my red chin  not cakey at all  flawless finish.  Will continue to purchase
B00414YL06|3|I was a little disappointed with the low pressure that the tongue cleaner attachment has (even at the highest level it is very weak). I expected the pressure to be a lot stronger. I don't feel like my tongue is that much cleaner after using. It is probably a better idea to just get a non-waterpik tongue cleaner.
B003KPCCUS|5|Because the combs were great. They were misrepresented though and the charges and number of combs were not the same!  Read carefully before you choose this product.
B001UHSVOY|5|This tub is huge. There is no way you will use this whole thing during pregnancy unless you use it 3 times a day. So far no stretch marks but I have a ways to go.
B001H6HOJQ|5|Sometime I'm too lazy to use the toner, or a set of thing that has to follow the steps. This cream does moisture my skin, easy to absorb, no sticky consistency and it has scent of good smell. I love it! :D
B0012BNVE8|5|This thing really halted my loss hair... I had been used it for over six month already. But be aware that you will depend on this to keep your hair in line....
B0012RXWMI|3|It doesn't really smell like the perfume, maybe lotion is different?
B00IMPUTGU|5|It arrived in wonderful condition and ready for use.  Just as expected.
B00F008GFQ|5|Love this brush.  Very soft and dense.  Cleans well without shedding. customer service is very helpful too.
B000YDFGT8|5|I started using this eye shadow at the age of 68 and was devastated when I could no longer find it in any of the retail stores I went to at age 74. I was thrilled to discover it online at Amazon and ordered a lot of it because I wanted to share with friends and have enough left over in case it is discontinued forever. I've used many eye shadows over the years and none compares to this one, and that includes the top brands sold in Nordstrom, Macy's, Dillards, etc. It is just a fantastic product!  I put a little bit on when I swim my laps and it holds up very well. I can only assume Revlon did not properly advertise this product as I'm sure it would still be on the store shelves if women saw how fantastic this product works and looks!
B0059U4AQ6|5|I bought this perfume for my daughter's birthday. I searched everywhere for the best price and I found it on Amazon. The perfume was just as exspected. The bottle is beautiful and displays nicely on her dressing table. The fragrance is great too. I find myself using a little too. Great fragrance at great price.
B005GIS3A0|4|*UPDATE*<br />I don't know if the short battery life was just a new battery getting a few charges or not, but now I'm quite impressed with the battery life of the trimmer.  It last quite a long time and I can take it on the road for a week without having to worry about recharging.  Just wanted to update my previous review.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />First, I agree that the battery life is dismal.  The first time I used the trimmer, I fully charged it and could not get through a complete shave without plugging in the device.  I do think the trimmer does a good job at giving you a relatively close TRIM, not shave, but TRIM.  It will never replace a true shaving device, but if you are the type that prefers the \\"5 O'Clock Shadow\\" look, then the Remington trimmer is worth a look.  If you are looking for a device that will trim your beard or mustache at various lengths, this device may work for you.  It is NOT a good device for a close shave, nor should it be used to edge your mustache or beard.  You can try to do it if you wish, but proceed with caution.  There are better devices on the market that will give you a good shave AND trim/shape your beard and mustache.  The Remington is not yet in the league of these devices.
B00B3XZ76A|5|Arrived really fast and my daughter says that it works great! She said it works just as good as her others that she had purchased in a department store.
B00CQNTHDK|5|Love this product
B000B61TWQ|1|The perfume that I received was old. The scent was not good at all.  When I contacted the ones who sent it to me, I was told that I would be called back to be told when and where to return the merchandise, but I never heard from anyone.  I was truly disapointed!!!!  I never got my money back.
B006O381BC|5|very happy with product, does what it says it's going to do. First time using this brand, next i will be trying the shampoo products. alittle high in expense, but i was very happy with product<br /><br />Thank you,<br />as good as it ket's
B007K6K0IY|5|I recently received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel through BzzAgent. I was a little reluctant to try it out because I have not been a fan of gel deodorants in the past. Secret Outlast has changed my mind completely! You only need a small amount ( I use one click per arm) and you are set for the day! It has been a HOT summer and I have never had to reapply during the day. Not only do I stay smelling fresh all day, but under my arms remain totally dry! Combine the odor and wetness protection with no more worrying about annoying white marks and I've been sold. Once my sample runs out I will definitely be buying more of this. I found my new deodorant!
B0006PLP7G|5|I've had plenty of others like this that I've lost over the years, but this one was the sharpest and easiest to use. The long black plastic extension actually did make it easier to use.
B000VSF00G|4|This relaxer system is great! I just purchased the complete set. Not only does it completely relax the hair, there's also a softness it provides. Just be sure to use gloves
B004PXM3US|4|Perfect little trimmer for eyebrows<br />easy to switch between the two different size heads that it comes with<br />small bag is great for travel<br />i think this works more as a trimmer than a razor<br />do not expect a clean no stubble shave with it<br />at least i have found it to be the case<br />have to still go and wax on my brows<br />but it helps for when i do not have time to fully wax<br />and helps me to shape them better than with just waxing<br />not sure i will use the cutsy little decals it has with it
B00I3PZ8QU|5|I have tried other brands but this wins hands down. I have had great results and no side effects at all. I used it one month and saw results. Lucky I ordered two bottles. I need to order more soon. I am glad that I took the chance on another brand. love this stuff. I look so much better. no more black eyes and spots.
B0063A4RXW|5|This wig took a little while to show up, but it did arrive prior to the estimate. (I think it was roughly 3 weeks or so.) The hair feels very soft, and it's actually pretty thick. I bought it for a Halloween costume that didn't work out, but I'll definitely be wearing it in the future!
B000IOAA6C|5|love it
B00D0AWMDA|5|Delicious fragrance, highly recommend.
B00E9JIUQ4|5|Awesome! Very pretty colors. Came quickly, unbroken, and no repeats. Very Happy.
B00449H3AI|5|Don't you hate it when your favorite products are discontinued?  I've been in love with this Sally Hansen color for years.  I was surprised and disheartened when I found it had been discontinued, so I turned to Amazon in search of my Balance.  I ordered 2 bottles from Cassiecosmetics and was not disappointed. They arrived very well packaged, bonus cosmetic bag and buff square as well.  Would have no qualms about using this seller again.
B007EP9APA|4|nice moisturizing oil.  not overly heavy.
B00D0NOX9I|5|Cover Girl Smoothers Pressed Powder is very comfortable to wear. I couldn't even feel it - no caking when my face got sweaty or oily later.  It covers shine with a perfect matte finish.  It goes on with no streaking or spotting. The compact itself is light and easy to carry. The mirror isn't of the cheap, cloudy variety, and is helpful for your lipstick.
B0094WEUOW|5|Excelent
B00BGL0868|3|it's cheap so don't expect too much out of this product. so if u want something quick and easy then this is for u.it doesn't get too hot in fact it doesn't get hot at all.
B00005V5OW|4|This is my \\"everyday\\" mascara.  I don't actually use it everyday (because I don't wear make-up everyday), but whenever I do during the daytime, this is my \\"go to\\" mascara.  It is great because it separates lashes well, looks more \\"natural\\" than other products (sometimes, people can't tell I am wearing it...and that is a good thing), applies evenly, and lasts a long time.  I have also found it to be economical, not only because it is cheap, but also because the applicator holds enough mascara to cover all my lashes (both bottom and both top) with just one application (no double dipping needed).<br /><br />A couple downsides:  1) It does sometimes clump in places.  The way that I prevent clumping as much as possible is that I get a clean tissue and gently roll the applicator on it.  It removes any excess mascara and goes on more evenly.  2) Sometimes, at the end of the day, I'll see little flakes of mascara on my cheek.  It isn't too bad, but does happen.<br /><br />One last thing - if you are looking for a mascara to really lengthen and thicken lashes, this isn't really it.  This mascara is simply provides your lashes with color and a little thickening/lengthening - which is why I use it for my \\"everyday\\" mascara because it provides a more natural look.  But, when I want something more dramatic, I use another mascara.
B000142MGA|5|These are the best I've ever used. They are soft without being fuzzy and leaving cotton around or in your eyes.. They are a tool I use everyday.
B000219LTI|5|My girl spends too much time out in the sun, getting tan and as blonde as can be.<br />I asked our Avon lady about this.She said it would repair my girl's sun damaged hair.<br />She has used it for a month now and her hair is shiny like it used to be and in much better shape, more soft .<br />Highly recommended, especially to sun worshipers.
B00397XUIK|5|This is one of the best skin care products I have ever used. It has become my sole skin regimen for all of my needs. Will not need to look further. This does the job.
B00BWYM4AW|5|Perfect! Thanks
B003V360NY|5|Very good with a razor, I like it.
B0032P3FRA|2|I got these as an add on gift for my bf's sis but know I don't know whether or not to give them to her anymore. The white pencils displayed are nothing like what you actually receive it more like the one the other person posted up! They really need to change that and for $10 you'd expect better looking merchandise...
B00JFU0B3W|5|exactly what I needed
B0009X66BU|5|Very nice - love the tip and the color is great!
B00N9SANLG|1|Nothing to what expected except for the color...It is a simple piece of clothing. Tried to return it but it is more expensive to return it than to keep it.
B002D99LHO|5|Great clipper
B0050N4DLE|4|Great product, works good on my curls. Was exactly as described. My only complaint is that it was had a leak.
B00CIA7OHC|4|Very good product, it really works, not as fast but works. I saw results after I finished my 4th bottle but I have to take vitamin C with it to really enhance the glutathione.
B00IJ85M0I|1|This scarf looses microscopic fibers constantly.  They get into your eyes and mouth and are almost impossible to find and pull out.  I have tries washing it several times and it still sheds fibers.  The colors of the scarf and size are great but I no longer can wear it do to this issue.
B009QAEW40|5|This product reminds me that God is real and is on my side. How else can I keep looking fabulous? BB cream needs to be called Miracle Anointing cream. Helps my skin tone look even and reduces the look of blemishes. Plus, no nasty stuff. Just good ole earth & mother nature ingredients. Just like Jesus.
B000E3BZWU|1|I was given the shampoo, instead of the conditioner. It really sucked, as you can imagine how it is when you wash your hair without conditioner.. Otherwise the shampoo was pretty good.
B0037FO44I|4|detangles damp hair well. I have a full head of tightly curly hair and this brush cuts my detangling time in half. the only negative is that it can be a little difficult to clean and the gel balls on the end tend to come off over a long period of time.
B003JAGL6A|1|SHE IS NOW BEING INVESTIGATED BY NU SKIN AFTER I ORDERED AN AGELOC CLEANSE AND TONE AND IT WAS COMPLETELY FAKE. I SENT PICS OF HER MAILING ADDRESS AND DETAILED PICS OF THE BOX AND BOTTLE TO THEM. IT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE TO SELL COUNTERFEIT AND HER STORE WILL BE SHUT DOWN SOON. BEWARE
B00H3U6UTA|1|I think this is fake...it is actually cheaper on the real BH website... I don't get it.and I've heard the package says made in China ...
B001L9D114|3|It falls apart pretty easily.  It's easy enough to put back together but it's a pain when you have to do it over and over again.
B000G3H5TK|5|I finally had enough with the expense and hassle of Proactiv. But after I quit it, my face exploded! I'd never had trouble like that in my life, with huge, cyst-like spots. In my search, I tried a Retin-A on prescription and a variety of other products. It was a nightmare. This product was part of the solution! It really does shrink a spot down, very quickly. It is amazing. I use it just in the morning, about five days a week, as an whole-face preventative treatment. I might dab a little on a rare spot, twice a day, if a tiny one pops up. In addition, I use a scrubby pad with Clean and Clear Oil-Free Cleaner, at night. That's it! So much cheaper and easier to use than Proactiv. This stuff will still bleach towels, clothes, and sheets, so use care. It's so well priced, it's worth a try and I recommend it to anyone struggling with break-outs. (Note: This product contains benzoyl peroxide, not the more popular salicylic acid. It seems like if one doesn't work for you, the other might, as they are completely different active ingredients.) Good luck!
B00KFNA4JY|5|I love it!
B00292BRTU|5|NICE product every when compared to the price.
B008F4HZ6K|5|Wow !!! Got this wig for my Auntie, Love the feel & texture. Very Happy, Just sad that I did not buy one for me !!
B00IODHUTE|5|much nicer then I thought. great buy
B00EP4B0IS|5|Wow - this item is really good; same results as much higher priced products.  Will buy again.
B000R90N60|3|I only gave this 3 stars since I am still trying to figure out my schedule for using this. I have sensitive skin,a lot of sensitivity to products and certain sunscreens so the reviews of this being gentle plus my dermatologists recommendation prompted me to buy. I am dealing with sun spots, melasma but also have redness on cheek and chin from years of sun worshipping which I gave up years ago but now have the lovely after effects. I used a Pea size amount for about a week and on day 6 or 7 developed Very red, warm and irritated skin. I didn't peel however. My eyes were actually swollen and sore. It was the chemical burn others described. Went out and bought Boots calming cream and some other very moisturizing products. if it said calming or redness relief i bought ;). I have just started using again since skin is back to normal. I used last nite, completely avoided eye area and applied a moisturizer about 20 minutes later. Skin was good this am but have decided to try an every other night routine. I do feel my skin is smoother and that spots are lightening so I want this to work, it will just be Slow going. I should have read more reviews and started every other nite, ditched my other aggressive treatment products, AVOIDED the eye  area completely and added a moisturizer on top.
B00LIM49ZQ|2|The chain snapped within a day of wearing it. I am smart enough to know how to 'make it work', but geez, the quality of this necklace is just terrible, even for a $10 necklace.
B001MA0QY2|4|Works great
B0046NWBS6|2|it was fine you can go to the Paul Mitchell studio and get this treatment for less than what I paid for the vile.! Ridiculous
B004PXIR1W|1|I purchased this on february. It breaks after 2 mons. I did follow the manual that charge it for 16 hrs at the first. The display pannel is not glowing in fancy blue, the lcd display is missing the bottom, I even can't readjust the Length anymore.<br />The blade still moving but otherwise is all dead.
B002WVBEH8|5|Live this!
B000X2DMEG|1|In my many years of experience with all different types of pomades, American Crew is the most frustrating; not only because the price is outrageous but because it is actually a very inferior product. If you have longer hair and are going for something like a pompadour or anything that requires hold, this stuff will not work. It lasts about 2 hours tops, and as soon as you're in the sun, it melts out. The worst part is that people buy into it because it's expensive and is marketed well. Suave used to make a water based pomade similar to this one for $3 that smelled better and held about 4 times stronger. If you have a lot of hair to work with I would recommend Murray's or Royal Crown, as they are the last few pomade's left that haven't been put out of business by American Crew. They're oil based which takes a little time to get used to, but after a week you'll be glad you switched. If you need something water based, I'd say just go with Axe. I'm not a huge fan of Axe either, but it's about twice as strong and half the price of American Crew. The bottom line is that this product is probably the worst and weakest pomade out there next to got2b's brand and they have the nerve to charge up to 5 times more than some better pomades.
B00DDRXRFM|1|I GOT 4 of the same plate and the others were not the ones pictured, plus the scraping tool doesn't work at all...Very dissatisfied
B004CHF8AY|2|I used this for one look during a photo shoot, and my hair stylist was laughing at the overall lack of coverage of the hair, and the bald spots this thing had. Copious amounts of hair fell out immediately upon just taking it out of its package, so I felt the need to be extremely careful with it, and just re-bagged it carefully until the shoot. We ended up putting a hat over it to hide any issues.
B006U420FS|4|my baby hair is hard to stay down. it needs extra extra extra holding gel to stay down and I would rather not use that. this works wonders
B00OHG5I4G|5|Works great!
B00DQN68KY|1|The &#34;leather&#34; trim was low grade vinyl and the lining looked and smelled like a black garbage bag. I will NEVER shop through amazon again
B000L596FE|5|So simple, yet life changing.  I wish I bought this brush years ago.  Detangles without pulling out lots of hair!
B00IWYSBU2|2|Purchased the trial pack direct for 9.95. Not as good as my 3 blade Mach3. The blades clog almost immediately. The head seems large and cumbersome and does not easily get into tight areas, on lip etc. It may be that I am used to the 3 blade setup pf the Mach3. The trimmer blade is horrible and hurts but really who cares.I may try the 3 blade at some time in the future. A hint for those who want to save money, buy the disposable Gilette at Costco, Sams etc and just pull off the blade (with a towel) and put on the Gilette handle if the disposable seems flimsy it is actually cheaper usually than replacement blades and I see no difference. I do like the fact that they claim to be made in the USA wish they felt better to me.
B003FYEZ9A|4|Good product that does everything it claims. I'd like it more if it dried faster.
B005KF5WYO|5|Daughter is very happy.
B0056BUFPI|4|The product came fast and was nicely wrapped. Its effect, however, is yet to be determined, since I haven't been using it for a long period of time. Having said that, from a month of use, I can see some slight changes in my dark circles, which look a little bit better. I will carry on using it and see what is going to happen.
B000RJUZMW|5|I purchased this razor approximately 2 years ago and lost it during a move.  It was so nice that I purchased another one.  I have saved so much money with this razor that I can now afford to go to Strip Clubs four times a month instead of twice a month.  The strippers love my smooth, clean shaven face.  I recommend using this razor with Merkur double sided platinum coated razor blades.  When you first begin to use the razor, you have to train yourself to use it or your face will end up a bloody mess.  It is recommended that you use short strokes. Do not use a canned shaving cream.  I always shave with Kiehl's White Eagle, and never cut my face anymore.  Here is the cost breakdown for operating this type of razor.  A pack of 10 Merkur Razor blades costs approximately 5 dollars.  Compare that to an 8 pack of Gillette razor blades which costs 28 dollars.  A razor blade on this razor lasts approximately 2 weeks.  You can use a strop and resharpen them, or you can just pitch them into the back of the container.  This is your grandpa's razor blade, and can also be yours.  Well worth the price.
B001FYV0HM|4|Love the shampoo and conditioner  - makes color treated hair very soft.  The only problem I have is getting the conditioner out of the bottle.  It's practically impossible.  No problem with the shampoo - and bottles are identical.  Wish Alterna would redesign the bottle into a pump or something easier to get the thick conditioner out.
B00BZU2PVG|5|Smells like real lilacs!
B005FAE3LW|5|This stuff is great! My stylist recommended this, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Second day using it, my hair felt and looked so much healthier.
B000NUODE6|5|I have been using Sudden Change Green Tea Night Repair Eye Cream for years to help with dark circles and wrinkles.  It also helps my concealer go on smoothly that provides flawless eyes (even at my old age).<br /><br />I used to purchase it at the store, but I couldn't find it anymore.  Thank goodness for Amazon and  Sudden Change!
B0015XN59Y|5|Seems to making my skin feel squeaky clean .
B003FBTY1M|5|My skin is sensitive and this product worked very well. This vendor is great to work with. Very fast and great pricing
B003Y0RTEI|5|Really great tool for any nail work, a little bulky, but with the variable speed options, and power ... I can live with that... now, finally I love it to work with my fingernails and toes ... ha ha<br /><br />Thank you Vogue Professional
B002LFROOC|3|It's nice, but not for an older person.  When I wear it, it wicks out into the fine lines around my lips, and looks ghastly.  It would be lovely on a younger person, though.
B000F5DRC8|3|It's too short for long hairs. If you have thicker and long hair, this tool won't be able to take your hair from bottom to top. I tried it and my hair is not very long. Made a few circles on the tool and half of that strand of hair still needs to be curled. I promise my hair is about 4 inches below shoulder.
B000T4UR9Q|5|I have used this makeup for over 40 years. I have tried other makeup but didn't give me the satisfaction as Max Factor. Thank you Amazon for finding this makeup. I'm very happy!!
B00DQBMN6E|1|It works well to tighten. Application is tricky. The bad part about it, is you cannot apply any moisturizer or Foundation either before or after. It won't work. It's a lot of money to spend on something that doesn't work. VERY disappointed.
B00852F7YY|5|This color is absolutely adorable - I've used it many times before ordering it! SO cute, and it came in earlier than expected which was a major plus! Can be a little gloupy at times, but otherwise the product is great!
B002UL10HY|1|Bought this brush for stippling and blending liquid foundation, and it worked great.  An occasional shed hair here or there but whatever.  This was my first time using this type of brush so I can't compare it to pricier ones, but I liked it...<br /><br />I would have given this brush 5 stars, but after a month of daily use and washing, what I can only assume is dye started leaching out of the brush (and onto my face!).  It's a dark bluish/black that keeps coming back to the brush even after washing it out numerous times.  I probably washed it 50 times and the dye wouldn't go away.  I finally gave up and bought a sonia kashuk brush from target...
B00OGDDWPM|1|I stop using my Latisse tretmente to use the reLash Serum and I lost all my new lashes that I gain with Latisse.
B0062W4LU0|3|Scent is a little​ overwhelming.
B004KVZTWY|5|This is a nice blend of warm and floral scents.  The fragrance is long-lasting.  The container is a convenient size.
B00L4FQVB2|3|The product lathers really well for not having any lathering agents (unnatural anyways), but it leaves my hair very squeaky dry like. I have to use the conditioner after. Not sure I will buy again.
B0070TSNSA|5|I smell like a lemon cookie and feel soft without heavy residue. I don't use hair products, and have been using this lotion for my thick curly dry hair and it's also great. I know a lot of folks wouldn't recommend body lotion for hair, but mine loves it so..eh! Great for Spring! :)
B001A24S2I|5|This moisturizer is great.  I love the light lemony scent, the fact that it has spf and it just soaks into my skin.
B00PCU8T9M|5|Have the BEST FACIAL EVER every day &amp; night in the comfort of your own home! This Konjac Sponge does just that! Gives you a personal facial every time you use it! I've used it myself after having a facial at a class Spa. Then I purchased one for each family member and friends who I loved! You, too, will love it!<br />Francine
B00FOBQ554|5|It never fails.
B001I8MJ2K|4|I didn't wax as much when using this product and it was gentle, non greasy on the skin. I didn't experience any break outs and I used this daily.
B006LTTBMW|4|If you're looking for WHITE pastilles, then pass on these--they are yellow. Like corn yellow--my daughter saw the bag & thought it was a bag of corn.<br /><br />If you just want a good base for some salve or emollient - then do consider buying these. They worked great for me. I melted once with oils & then remelted the same batch again when it didn't turn out just the way I wanted it to. Melted beautifully both times over a double boiler. Very pleased!<br /><br />No official organic seal on these so you'll just have to cross those fingers & trust that they're organic. The seal does make one a bit more confident in a product's true organic nature. If you're a stickler for wanting to stay clear of pesticides then you may want to look for another batch that comes with the &#34;USDA organic&#34; seal emblazoned on the package.
B00M9IG744|3|This brush was amazing for the first week I had it.  My hair was beautifully glossy and smooth.  I couldn't believe it!  After the first week, it just worked like any other brush.  None of the &#34;magic&#34; from the first week.  I tried picking out all my hairs from the brush and rinsing it under water, but it didn't help.  Is there something else I'm supposed to be doing to maintain it?  I wish I knew...
B00J2H2ZIW|5|I use it every morning on my face and neck.  Best sun screen in the world.  Try it. Smells really good.
B004F0PD9Y|5|Very good product. When my daughters friends use hers they always say how good hers works compared to theirs. Definetly worth the price. Wonderful product.
B00BEWW9W0|3|Gave this 3 stars because it did lighten my hair  evenly without burning or stinging my scalp. Didnt damage my hair like bleach normally would. And it smelt a little better than bleach.<br />I had started with dark brown hair and ended up with gingery orange hair with a whole lot of brass in it. My fault for believing in the color results on the box.
B000W3XB9M|4|I love the smell of lime oil.  I purchased this exclusively for when I make laundry soap and fabric softner, to soften it.  Very simple to make fabric softner crystals, similar to Purex Crystals:  4 cups epsom salts, 20 drops of your fave essential oil (modify to preference).  I love 10 drops lavendar + 10 drops lime, mix well, 1-2 TBSP per load.  Love the Now Foods oils, decently priced and work well.
B00639DLV2|4|It's smells so good. I used it at the pool yesterday and it was great. No stinging or oily feeling. And best of all no burn! Great sunscreen.
B000C234ZY|5|One of my most favorite perfumes!!!
B002HM3EM0|4|Great!  Just a heads up it makes my hair stay wet longer than usual if you air dry
B00BVO7EIA|2|did not like the smell at all.
B0015TGBDA|1|We bought this as a teaching aid, we have RN teachers who have worked for many years in ER and ICU, none of them have been able to get &#34;blood flow&#34; through an IV, this has proved to be a waste of our school dollars. We would not recommend this as a teaching aid.
B005GFVU9Y|5|This is a great product, and I recommend it to anyone. Nice size bottle too.
B004HNETL2|5|Nivea Cool Kick is the best of the series aftershaves from Nivea. I used Nivea Balm for more than 10 years but this new product is just perfect - it soothes the skin and is a quite pleasant gel with beautiful aroma.<br />Just the best!<br />It can't be found in shops but in Amazon is available.<br />Thanks Amazon, you saved me a lot of time.
B0000YV758|5|I used this product for several yrs now. It's the only one that does not leave my hair oily or heavy. I little dab will do ya. Plus there is no curl activator smell. i have thick curly hair so I need a little man made moisturizer. Hoping it is not off the market.
B001E762H8|4|Hi I just got this product today and I am little confused about the way the jojoba vial is used that comes with the shampoo, It says two after you shampoo your hair twice and towel dry it that you add a few drops of the jojoba into a small amount of shampoo an dmake a lotion and then leave in my hair? Leave shampoo in my hair? Wont this dry my hair out and live it feeling waxy and strange? Can some one please tell me If I am reading and understanding the directions on the shampoo correctly. Thank you
B001MA0QY2|5|Feels great having a new straightener again. Heats quickly and smooths hair without pulling.
B00AACC02Y|5|I have tried many products some of which are expensive.  I have never gotten a compliment until today.  The product is a sunscreen and moisturizer.  Great buy.
B000FQ5W6Q|5|I love this perfume. The scent is great!
B0015KHMRS|5|I have owned and used both the Wahl 9906-2001 and Wahl 5537-1801 mustache/beard trimmers for a number of years.  Both have worked well for me; I keep my facial hair trimmed very short, using the blade as opposed to the combs -- so I can't comment on the combs and other accessories. I like the AA-battery feature as I travel to places without 110v electricity.  I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries (on almost all my battery operated gadgets) and a single charge lasts a long time (a few months) when using the trimmers every other day at home. -- While they have taken a lot of use, neglect and rough handling over the years of use and travel, they are not indestructible -- tonight I dropped my 5537 on a tile floor and broke the blade. <frown - about my carelessness>  So I'm online tonight, placing an order for a replacement.  While I'm waiting for it to arrive, I'll pull the other 9906 trimmer out of my travel pack to use.
B002TQ4AO0|5|I like these shavers so much that I now have four of them and leave them in different rooms and in my cars.  They are so handy, compleatly portable, and cut my wiskers very well.  They are also great for a late-in-the-day touch up.
B00F90VOP6|5|This case was everything I thought it would be.  I encountered a small problem with company sending the wrong (pink) stylus of which did not match the purple case. Upon contacting them directly not only did they return my email in a very timely manner they also sent me extra stylus' along with the one that was supposed to accompany the original order.  Because of their promptness and great customer service that went along with my beautiful bedazzled case, I felt the deserved 5 stars!
B008CT12G2|4|I like it - not sure I'll get it again - there are a few other items on teh market I'd like to try for the price ... but overall the puffiness was improved and the soothing nature of the cream was effective + the wrinkles are still held at bay -  &#62;''&#60;
B005Y6F4WO|5|I love painting my nails and creating designs almost everyday. So, these dotting tools make it so easy. Good price. Shipping did not take forever :)
B008A12F36|5|This fit my T3 Featherweight with a little tweaking.  I am so pleased.  It is strong, well made, and has several couplers that will allow it to fit others dryers as well.
B006TM0PI0|3|it does not remove a lot of hair only stubble.that means you can apply it on for at lest 15 minutes and i think it takes longer than that.
B00GN7SL4G|1|horrible product and i ask for a refund .then i have to pay shipping to return it
B00G2AZGGK|5|I love these tooth pics, won't use anything else.
B004S0ETGY|5|I'm not going to be silly and give this item a one star review (since it is a very nice product) but remember that Philosophy products are very wordy on the front of their packages! Thank goodness I zoomed in on this one as it has a whole spiel about letting God take control of your life... I almost sent this to an atheist!! Oh my, I'm glad I caught it before it got sent :)
B000H88PCU|1|This spray bottle was disappointing.  It is so top heavy if it isn't full, it topples over  I should have paid more attention to the fact that it is only an 8 ounce bottle and will not work for what I had intended. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B001N1HNCS|1|This flat iron was marked down by a lot and that should of told me not to order it. I bought it maybe 9 months ago and forgot to right a review. It never got hot enough and did not run smoothly through the hair. The plates got loose and  discolored. I never heard of Le Angelique  brand and I never will by this brand again. I usually buy my hair tools from my local supply store with no problems.This iron fell apart quickly and I was to busy and angry to check the return policy . I didn't even have the original box anymore either. The width of this iron was not true to size.Terrible    terrible product.
B007K6K0IY|5|Wow, I'm just blown away with this deodorant! I got to test it for free for my BzzAgent campaign and from the start I was impressed with its effectiveness! It claims to keep you 48h odor free with two swipes after the shower and boy, it did! It kept me dry and odor free the whole day, from all day at work to my gym workout, it delivered as promised! One of the best things about it is that it's white mark free and it does,t ruin my clothes, which is a big plus! I love the clean scent and the texture of it is just amazing! I would recommend it to everyone on the go, with a hectic day schedule like mine! Best deodorant out there!
B005G7QJRK|5|i love this fragrance and plan to get it again in a larger size i will be buying it again
B003N4YDGW|4|Pros, it's bendable, and the brush is not rough on your skin,  Some people have said that the brush doesn't do a well job when doing your back because it's handle or pole hits your shoulder and there by keeping from touching your skin,  The very easy fix for this is don't extended all the way  leave or more click before it's full extension and you won't have the problem mention above, I'm a disable vet, I have to sit in the shower to scrub and this is very helpful.
B003JMYJWQ|5|I use this product as a daily leave in conditioner.  I braid my hair every night and place the silk scarf on it until the next morning and then I finger them loose.  This product holds the wavy to curly pattern and it helps keep the moisture.  My hair has body and is very shakeable when I am done fingering the braids loose.<br />This products smells of cleanliness and Lilacs and has a med thick like consistency and it doesn't leave your hands or hair sticky,<br />Always let your hair dry completely before placing the silk scarf on it.  If you leave it wet with the product, when you loose it the next morning, the hair will not be in an holding pattern.<br />There is nothing about this product that I dislike.  I love the way it works in my hair as well as the smell and the prices is the best.<br />This product is always above my expectations.  I purchased about 3 of these items from Amazon and believe me this product is well worth trying out.
B0006OU078|5|Love It!  Gentle on  the skin....it does the job. Bought three more for my daughters and they like it too.
B00CXDVRU4|5|Totally happy with this purchase. I bought this set form daughter for Christmas and she really enjoys the softness of the brushes and the case. I like the support provided by Jacklin and YALMEH. You will not find a better brush set for the money.
B005CPCHNQ|5|I love them and it works
B00CLILRMY|5|this stuff is magic. love it love it love it. saw an instant improvement. this product is amazing!! would recommend to anyone and cannot beat the price or the fast shipping.
B00C7HM818|4|Pleased with the retractable cord,variety In size of rollers (they do heat up quickly). Somewhat disappointed in the clips not a tight fit and hair does come out of the roller because of this. Overall good product.
B000I1S18Y|5|My son likes me to cut his hair.  We always have issues with the clippers.  The have held up well, actually better than the others that we have purchased.
B007JP6XE6|5|excelent
B000QA7HNC|5|The order came sooner than expected. I love it.
B000C1ZFBG|5|excelente
B00S5643SQ|5|I have used bare minerals for 17 years. I'm on meds that dehydrate my skin. I went to the BM store and purchased the Completion Rescue. I LOVE IT!!!<br />I noticed a difference after a couple of days. The coverage is great, you can ad more for more coverage.
B00IJ08RYY|5|Bought for wife. She love it and says it is a great product covers well goes on smooth and even. Just as good as the name brands.
B00AP53BM4|5|Smells just like I hoped! Only difference between it and ed heardy's villain is $59+ ! It was a great deal and great purchase!
B004L96PF0|5|This acne cream has always worked for me for years. Everyone skin is different though. Mine is moderately acne prone and gets very oily under any stress and can get dry with no moisturizer. I find the results of this cream more noticeable than that of the creams at general drugstores. I find that this cream really curbs my acne to the point of me forgetting what my usual acne is like.
B00SZNUK2C|5|Please note that this is a 1 oz container.  That being said, it is still a great price for this product.  This has a cucumber-y smell, it is cooling to the eyes.  A little goes a long way.  I have not used this product long enough to determine long term effects.  As with any product of this type, one should use it every day for several weeks to see the full benefit.  However, the skin around my eyes is softer in the mornings, after using this product at night.  I wear a lot of eye makeup and this product soothes my eyes after eye makeup removal.  I am not real wild about the packaging of this product.  It is a gel like consistency that would have worked well in a pump dispenser. Although, the small size container does make it ideal for travel.  As a review blogger, I was provided this product for my review, I am under no obligation to write a positive review.
B005MTK4RI|5|My wife enjoys this product!
B00306CISI|5|Works excellent!! Tried other brands and this has been the best!!!!!
B00014EKWY|2|Although the biotin makes the hair seem thicker it does make your hair a bit frizzy.  If you color your hair<br />It does strip the color quicker then using a shampoo for colored hair.
B00IPLW3WO|3|IT'S OK.  NO STAYING POWER
B0058E3XJI|1|I purchased this tanning lotion after having good results with it in the past. When I first opened the lotion I noticed that the color was a little off. Also, the lotion was very thin, unlike what I had purchased from my salon in the past. I have used the same bronzing tanning bed for the past 5 years and have never had a burn. After using this lotion one time, I had a horrible burn. Two weeks later, and my skin is still peeling head to toe. Horrible lotion. Bad experience! I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00AFJ5LDM|4|This is good stuff.  Works well.
B006ZA0A5Y|4|It works!!
B0011DHU8U|1|when i got the package the shampoo bottle was leaking and the pump doesn't work.<br />very dissapoined and had to replace with other pump
B003TQU1Q0|4|I really like this moisturizer.  My infant daughter has pretty bad eczema and from reading some reviews for this, I decided to get it and try it out.  Guess what??  Almost instantly, she didn't seem like she was itchy and didn't cry when I put her down so that I could do some chores and napped pretty well that day too.  I was so excited.  Within 2 days her skin that used to feel like sandpaper feels A LOT smoother!<br /><br />We have tried Aquaphor but it was incredibly greasy and it bugged me to death that it would get on everything.  Cetaphil Restoraderm isn't greasy and it absorbs into the skin rather quickly.  I would highly recommend this product.  The only downside to it is that it's kind of pricey (from CVS) and maybe next time I'll order it online.  However, it works and gives me the peace of mind that my baby's skin is healing (or at least not as itchy and red) and is a happy baby once more.  THANK YOU CETAPHIL!!!!!
B00MF2YL2O|5|Beautiful extensions, but bleed A LOT when washed or wet. No problem though, when the color bleeds out you can re-dye extensions purple or pick a new color! ;)
B00T0UBVX6|5|I love using this after I use my cuticle remover. It leaves my cuticles moisturized and easy to apply. I find it soaks in really quickly as well. Can't wait to find more uses for this!
B00J3K9W6G|5|Excellent value.  Quality is quite good and at the price paid I could not be more satisfied.
B0083OZ14U|5|Perfect size for purse or pocket & it works just as well as the larger size!! I love it !!
B0049LUI9O|5|This thing works like a charm. I've had this for a year now, and it still works. The machine actually cuts the hair. I use it on my eyebrows, nose, and ear hairs. I've never had an issue with this thing at all.
B004TGUKG0|5|This tool does what it says. It rips hair from the follicle at a high velocity.<br /><br />Yes it hurts, mostly the first time. However, subsequent use hurts less because it's a new hair with a thinner root and lighter in color. It's not a thick root that's been cut for years and years.<br /><br />No, it doesn't leave you as smooth as shaving does initially. But it lasts longer and the hair is softer. Again, because it's new hair.<br /><br />If you understand hair growth you'll realize that this tool will take a little time to get the best results, just like waxing. Hair grows in 3 phases, so it will take several months for all the hair to be new, softer, lighter colored growth.<br /><br />I've been using mine every few days for 2 weeks and already notice a difference in the look and feel of &#34;stubble.&#34; I hated the stubble of shaving more than the inconvenience of having to do it all the time. Within 24 hours my legs felt like sandpaper, my armpits looked smudged, and my bikini area would itch. No longer!! That's what I love the most! You can't really even see any hair under my arms, and my bikini area doesn't itch anymore!<br /><br />I tried home recipes for sugaring before resorting to this. The first time the pain is very similar in intensity, but this was easier for me to do. And not as messy! With subsequent uses the pain is much, much less. And yes, there's irritation. The first time, again, is the worst, but leave yourself a few hours of recovery.<br /><br />Overall, a great alternative hair removal method.
B0043X2HF6|5|Really nice lipgloss. Not to sticky. It looks pretty alone, but even nicer over lipstick.
B000772U86|5|This is by far the best product on the market. It works for me and also my dog. It takes care of my bee stings, my cuts and bruises and my moscito bites. But also for my dog which has a rash on her belly. She loves to run through high grass, so whatever she is allergic to? I do not know but it works like a charm. I could not find it on Amazon for a while, and ordered 2 tubes when I saw it again. Thanks for a great product! I hope you have it in stock always. I am a regular buyer on Amazon, do not write many reviews, this one is well deserved.
B004GFR3GY|1|The metal swipe scratched my metal disks.  Was very upset about that.  they need to improve that aspect.<br />The item was not worth the price that I paid.
B001G5FOLI|5|Wow! Very impressed! As being someone who has never used a safety razor, I wasn't sure what blades to get. I asked around and these blades kept getting mentioned. So I figured, 'Might as well.' I ordered and they were in the mail within 24 hours. They came a week earlier than expected, which I was very pleased at. Popped one in my razor and shaved that night. I was surprised that I didn't nick myself, except for a pimple that I had, with the reputation they have. Overall, I am very impressed,  and I will never use another razor again, if I can help it. (I even bought shave soap to up the experience!)<br /><br />Will buy again.
B002ZNJIGM|1|I ordered this make up face so that i can practice my face paint.... big mistake it doesn't come off!!!<br /> ...so i decided to use it for what it was intended for...and as well it doesn't come off ...i drew eyebrows with my eyebrow kit and it stained the face....i've tried to scratch it off,rub it off and its stained... good for light make up nothing heavy or dark... waste of money ...
B005DO1FZC|1|I have used extream thrust for years! And LOVED IT! However, i moved to conneticut years ago and so i ordered it thru here, and when i recieved my product it was not extream thrust and the packaging was tottally different. So i called Austrialian Gold and talked to someone who had informed me that Thurst has been discontined and what i had recived based on what i discribed to her that this was not an authentic AG product. And the fact that Thrust was only retailed out of florida she said thats another heads up when its comming from somewheres else. So just beware. Im going to send mine back and find another product similar to exteam thrust.
B007D1VGSY|5|I smelled this in a magazine, and was very impressed.<br /><br />I'm not a fragrance expert so I'm not going to talk about bass notes, dry down, hints of patchouli or all that nonsense.  It has a pleasing masculine smell that lasts a very long time and would be overpowering if too much was sprayed on.<br /><br />I've smelled a lot of the current designer fragrances, and many are quite generic or overdone, with numerous versions of the same fragrance like sport, intense, noir, etc.  I like that this is a little harder to find in the stores, so is a little more unique, and you're less likely to be standing in an elevator with someone else wearing the same fragrance; if that bothers you.<br /><br />I'd say this would make a good fragrance for evening wear, and is going to be good for the fall or winter.<br /><br />I noticed that another review raised a flag about fake product.  This shipped directly from Amazon on their Prime program.  It was carefully packaged just as you would expect to see it in the store.  You have to remove the plastic wrapper, the product was boxed appropriately, and the product looked like the real deal.  I certainly have no suspicions that it is authentic.
B000C1VSXU|5|This is the only  perfume that I use.  I've been using it for many years and do not ever plan to use anything else.  So many other perfumes that I have tried are so strong that it gives me a headache.  This has a nice soft scent that when combined with your body chemistry will give you your unique scent. Love it!!!
B000J10IRK|5|I've tried soooo many things in the past for my acne prone..oily skin and was to my wits end. This is an awesome product. Within a week my skin had cleared up visibly and remains clear to this day. I won't use anything else. Murad leaves my skin feeling clean and I use it along side the moisturizer....gosh this sounds like a infomercial for Murad! I do try and recommend this product to as many people with the same issues as I have. I WAS in my 30\\"s and still having problems with acne....not fun! Well...NOT anymore! GREAT PRODUCT!
B001FOFI0W|5|Marrakesh oil is great on your hair.  Not oily if you only use two or three squirts.  The smell is wonderful.
B003ATS2QC|5|Love this digital scale being able to see results in fractions of a pound.I like the black/silver color because it is easy to keep clean vs clear glass. It is thin and easy for elderly people to step on and off.
B000EPA4FW|5|I started using this about 3 years ago and it works great. I keep trying different washes because I run out of that first (I wish they sold these separately) but each time I use a different wash the acne comes back...with a vengeance!  I always kick myself and ask myself why I always do this :) I guess I look at the cheaper cleansers and get pulled in but I think I spend more on them because I end up throwing away half the bottle just to buy this one again. Meanwhile I always end up with acne but this stuff will get rid of it within days not weeks. I have come to terms that this product is the ONLY thing I will use for my face now. I have zero acne and my face is not oily or dry while using it.  I am now buying this for my daughters to use.  I am DONE with this acne battle!
B00FCYJPIM|5|Best skin product I've tried. So happy that I found this product o line. This oil leaves my skin wonderfully hydrated & soft to touch. It doesn't have a overbearing scent that clashes with perfumes. In a pinch it makes a good hair oil & was gentle enough for me to use on my face. Love this oil. Will definitely buy again !
B0062CTOY8|5|Good seller.  Product actually smelled minty
B001ET79H8|2|I just love Cetaphil gentle cleanser and bought this one by mistake.  It works and that's why I gave it 2 stars but it is so STRONG smelling that I simply can not use it.  I do not have a problem with scents or perfume but this is over powering.  It's so bad that I stopped washing my face with it after one try and I cant even wash my hands with it as the smell creeps into my mouth and nose.<br /><br />Unless you have no sense of smell do not buy this.
B00TB00HPS|5|As a new mom, I could NOT survive without Amazon Prime and dry shampoo via Amazon Prime! I never used dry shampoo before my son, and with infrequent salon visits, this dry shampoo covers gray and oil  Now I can get by with washing my hair only twice a week if necessary.
B001HBUFIS|4|Always liked the product, a little pricey with the shipping but worth it as a treat to myself! Try it.
B00KERHWGO|2|The description says &#34;Spade Shape at one end and Sharp Tip and the other.&#34; However, I received sticks with spade shape at both ends... not what I wanted.
B006BA3BAY|5|LOVE IT.  It has a nice smell and makes my hair very soft.  I put it in at night and sleep in it, (definitely wash it out next day cause it's pretty oily looking!).  I'd buy this again and again!
B00I32AN4K|5|I've only used it for 2 weeks now, and so far I love it.  I have really damaged hair that hasn't been trimmed forever and this product has made a difference.  Once I finally get around to getting it cut, I'm sure this will keep my hair soft and looking good.
B000GBMYC0|5|This is one of the best razors I have ever used. The new foil cutter block makes it just like new again.
B005UL3LVY|3|Not the same colors as shown but some colors are nice..
B001A50RVG|5|I expected this nail clipper to significantly outperform the nail clippers I've been buying from large retail stores and beauty supply<br />shops. And, it did. Many, many years ago, it was a simple task to buy a high-quality steel, with exceptionally sharp blades, nail clipper. The quality has declined so much, that I had no choice in rating this  five stars, even though it may not be as good as those of decades past.
B0013TVEWA|5|This is my first electronic toothbrush and I love it! I reviewed all the ones out there and even went to check them out at Bed Bath and Beyond. My teeth feel amazing and super clean. You do get used to the vibration and I like the 30 second reminders to change positions. Amazon has the best price by far for the toothbrush, but for the replacements I found a package of 7 for $35 at Costco... so pile away!!
B001MA46EI|5|If you want the cleanest pores and most beautiful complexion, this is MUST have. i love this!!!!!joy h. knoxville,tn
B0051I6DA2|5|Surprisingly, it works very well without the dangerous chemicals.  I was a little skeptical because some Eco items don't work as well as the original but this item does and I will buy it again.
B005GQ6HUK|1|There was no top on this when I received this. It was all over the plastic casing when it was delivered
B000JFCF8Q|5|I love these gloves - thin enough to wear to bed at night. For some reason, I wake up some mornings and they are off!! Strange
B001ELX290|4|This stuff really works!
B00752ZKSS|2|Seriously guys i was so excited to finally have these bobby pins but the black literally comes off with the slightest touch. it's annoying.. the only reason i gave this two stars was because i found myself using way less bobby pins and it hold the hair more in place. i never had to worry about it coming out
B004USS51E|5|It was what i expected thank you.
B001MA0QY2|3|I was so excited to order thia flat iron. Based on all the reviews and youtube videos saying how awesome it is. Ihave thick wavy and some what frizzy hair. The iron does not heat up hot enough like I thought it would. They include a glove which makes you think its going to get to get really hot. It will get hot dont get me wrong, but nothing like I thought it would. I have tried all the heat settings ..and have to go over the hair more than twice to get a smooth finished look. I guess you get what you pay for. Im going to have to splurge on another iron which is a bummer.
B00HJ6XIUM|2|Perhaps it insulates too well - when we had the pad on the cooling pad, we couldn't feel any cold through it. Granted, we didn't wait a lot of time to see if it would allow the cold to get through or not. Instead, we removed the insulating pad and just make sure that the cooling pad goes over clothing or an ace wrap.
B00398CGOS|5|smells great, lathers well.  love it.
B002F34YG6|5|Best shampoo and conditioner I ever used. Perfect for the price which is by far the cheapest I ever seen.
B00CDJAMNG|1|THEY SHED AS SOON AS I WASHED THEM :(
B00GW4OVF8|5|Love my brushes ❤. I will highly recommend
B002N5MKLW|5|I've been using Moroccanoil for several months now and the change in my hair has been remarkable. I have corse think hair that I straighten daily. After using this shampoo for a few weeks my hair maintained shine consistently. I know longer have frizz or fly aways! I would recommend this to anyone with complex hair :)
B00005O0MZ|5|I hung mine. Found the right hanger and placed it to the side of my vanity. Great balance, good grip, plenty of power. Good luck!
B009XPRZJW|4|The stitching is crooked but for only a few dollars, it will work for exactly what it is needed for. This is to be my bath accessories bag for a trip to Japan and with all the small separate compartments, on the outside, it's perfect and the inside is big enough for my travel towel and hair towel!!
B0081X4XEM|4|Not sure if it is authentic MAC brand but daughter is happy regardless.  Seems to be a nice product regardless of authenticity.
B007O7AZ3O|5|It's what I was waiting from Real Techniques.  A very fine brush, easy to use and clean.  I love it for cream and gel liners.
B003VRAKUY|5|Since I have bought this product it has become a go to.  It is stunning and rich with color.  It makes a GREAT eyeliner.
B001QY8QXM|1|cheap cheap cheap razor blades--both in price and in quality.<br /><br />They come out of the wax paper with stains, looking like they've already been used. They cut OK about two times, but by the third, they're pulling as much hair out as they're cutting.<br /><br />No more Russian crap for me!
B0080GV0Z0|3|Imprints don't seem deep enough
B000TTPZQ6|2|Had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews. I don't know if  I received an old product or what, but the smell is awful. I will not use.
B00KWYN9JS|5|love these - help keep my feet soft - and easy fit !
B00ELNDKUY|2|When I got this it made my hair oily and have used VO5 which is has made it almost the same.  It was a waste of my money
B00BT8539U|4|I was introduced to this product by a dear and close friend who had used this product on her face and was very happy with the results .... I too bought this product and sure enough was pleasantly surprised as how it made my skin on my face and around the eyes so smooth and revived by just a touch of the lifting serum under the eyes each night. Love this product and the company behind it and would recommend it to all my other firends as well ....
B004HXXO1I|5|You get a good amount of product for how small it is. It has lasted about a year and still is alot.
B00NCFU988|5|I'm a cosmetology student and this is the best curling wand I've used.
B005EII4FQ|2|I love the color, but the eyeshadow crumbles somewhat onto my face. I really want to use it, but I have to be very careful when I apply it to avoid getting the crumbles on my face. I expected more from L'Oreal. Having said that- I choose to keep this eyeshadow because the color is so vibrant and it is better than the other shadows in this class.
B0019CGUFC|5|I LOVE BOOTS! If the U.S. decided not to sell Boots anymore, if I could afford it, I'd go to England just to buy some! Just joking, I know you can get in on the net,but thats how much I love their products
B0019EPJ2K|5|Apply to hair after using Clay Esthe MotoBene Shampoo.  Rinse out.  Leaves hair smooth and soft.
B00871KO7S|5|I ordered from beauticom. They are located in the US so I recieved these 2 pink nail brushes super fast. Less than 1 week of ordering. These nail brushes are true to the picture and they are exactly what I expected. They are great for getting the dirt under your nails. They are small so I ordered them so my sister and I could both have one in our travel kits. You can't beat this price and I also like how you do not have to buy the whole pedicure set to get these! Very pleased with this purchase!
B00NY5NGPE|4|Serum is a bit thick but feels so soft on my face.  Should I be using a moisturizer with this or is this a stand alone product? It helps clear my skin of acne but also seems to block pores and cause acne.  Yes, clears acne but causes acne. The benefits outweigh my concerns.  I'll be buying this again.
B0017TK2TC|5|I like that it a) heals my hands and b) is edible. My pets love to lick my hands and I don't have to worry about them ingesting chemicals. Plus it has a very nice scent.
B0037QGBES|5|Yes, I love the kouros by yves saint Laurent eau de toilette. I would like to order another if possibly
B009WUUOC8|5|smooth transaction...happy with purchase!
B002X33LZS|1|This is a very hard to handle iron.  The titanium irons I have used in the past are far superior to this.  There is not enough &#34;slip&#34; when pulling thru the hair and often find the temperature inconsistent.  Better off with Babyliss.
B001DLRHK6|5|As someone with a bronze complexion this shade compliments my face perfectly! I love the shade. I don't wear any other makeup when I'm wearing this lip color!
B002GUIDEM|1|To small
B001WX0F86|5|This is the best soap. If you buy this soap it will be the only soap you will ever need. It takes away all bacteria and fungus as well as good smelling and making your skin soft. You will never need any other soap. I truly like this and if you want to go all natural it is all you need. You will be addicted as soon as you use it, because it makes you feel so clean and it is gentle enough for a baby's skin or sensitive skin as well so if you want natural and gentle good smelling and fresh this is a for you.
B000H3D9GW|4|I really like this make up and found it to be better shade and quality, with SPF, than what I could buy in the drugstore for the same price-because it came with two bottles, and I had never noticed it in store before.    I am glad I tried it and will use Amazon.com next time I want cosmetics.
B003IHVC0O|5|Pros<br />-Extremely saturated, vivid color<br />-Sweet grape scent<br />-Durable & elegant design<br />-This formula feels very comfortable on lips<br /><br />Cons<br />-Stains lips (removing can be a little bit challenging)
B00005A443|2|I'm kind of disappointed by the battery life on this thing. When I initially got it I was upset that it was battery operated in the first place but that was probably a huge oversight on my part. But I swear the batteries don't even last through one makeup application! Also the light doesn't give off enough light. BUMMER. But the mirror is of good quality aside from the lighting issue.
B008LF2DBA|5|I enjoy this case because it fits all my make up with amazing organization and easy to reach pockets. The quilt style is durable and small/large enough to travel with. Overall very satisfied.
B00067EJ4U|1|After reading fabulous reviews about her cosmetics I decided to take the plung. I purchased the primer, moisturizing foundation, and translucent powder. Personally they are not worth the $$$ and I returned them. I actually looked worse and washed out. It may work for some individuals but not me. I am going back to my Mary Kay!
B009RNUH7M|5|I love Simple products!!!
B008E2LF2I|5|This Mascara is great! It makes my eyelashes long, and the curl actually stays through out the day (when i curl them pre-putting on the primer/mascara). might flake a little, but this is the only mascara that doesn't bother my eyes (I wear contacts).
B000C21424|5|Not my first purchase of this perfume, love, love, love it.  I get multiple compliments on the scent and the price is right.
B000052YQU|5|got this small one for my sister, she loves Ponds products. wow  i can't wait for my next order. love Ponds
B00893PTWO|5|the product I have got was exactly what I expected. I received it for one week. I'm happy for it.
B000C21CQW|5|Awesome experience!!!
B00011ROPC|5|FIND THIS Q-GEL EASY TO USE, AND FEELS SO SOOTHING ON THE SKIN...I USE IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AFTER CLEANSING AND BEFORE MOISTURIZER...STARTS THE DAY OFF BY PERKING YOU UP!
B00GUK3KOC|5|I just love the hat.  As a matter of fact everyone was so impressed, I had to order the hat in different for 6 other women.
B006GQYSC8|5|Works good
B007M8733U|5|Great stuff! Girls love this ;)
B003U8ESI4|5|Excellent trimmer. Charges fully within an hour. Lasts over 1 week with every other day usage. The vacuum feature grabs 80% of the clippings and is a nice bonus.
B001FWXIVU|5|In love with the scent! Certainly one of my favs! I plan to order another bottle since it's an older fragrance and can't be found in stores.
B007SZCG0C|5|I've always had fine hair, which has been a challenge for me my entire life. Sometimes even having to hide spots that are a bit thin with varying hair styles, especially when its \\"shedding\\" season.<br /><br />I've tried different types of hair thickening shampoos/mouses/gels etc to thicken my hair, but I didn't like the results of those products. A lot of them make the hair sticky and others made it flaky etc which I really don't like.<br /><br />Also, I really don't like products that are complicated and difficult to use. This one is simple and straight forward, no hot oils to deal with etc, just use it like it's shampoo. Of course, it's higher priced than regular shampoo, but that's to be expected, because it's not just regular shampoo.<br /><br />I was happy to find all the \\"healthy\\" ingredients in it such as the Saw Palmetto, which is the ingredient that I think helps people with fine hair. I prefer things to be all-natural and although I wish it didn't have the SLS, it is what makes the nice lather!<br /><br />At first I was skeptical to try it, but the 100% satisfaction guarantee by the company made me feel more comfortable to go for it and give it a try.<br /><br />I'm glad to find it! It smells great too!
B001FB5IIC|5|I suffer from psoriasis so this is essential in my dry climate. 8 more words bs either it works in ten words or it doesn't
B00G8OHXAM|5|I like, skin is a very soft after used.
B00L1KFQKC|5|I've been bleaching my hair for so long that it was nearly dead.  Ever since I started using this product my hair has life again and looks beautiful.  I love it and would absolutely recommend it for everyone
B00BQLYBTI|3|The title says for women however it smells more like a man's cologne so I am not sure that title is 100% correct.
B00KYDMAF6|5|Love this leave in conditioner. Makes your hair soft and manageable but not oily.
B005EMWB38|1|I ordered what the pictured showed however that  is not the product that showed up. Must be an updated version that has changed since the original product. Do NOT like at all.
B00I3QQADO|4|Lightly scented bars are smooth, oval, and larger than average store brands. The fragrance is light and clean. Love the fact that they are made in the USA and are made from natural ingredients. Were they pink and the rose fragrance a bit stronger, these would earn five stars :-)
B0031OOHB0|5|Lasts forever. Doesn't have an overpowering smell to it (actually if there is any kind of downside to it is that it doesn't smell that much at all, but maybe that's what aftershave is for). For the price, you cannot do better.
B005X5GFLK|5|My hair looks full, shiny, and cared for.<br /><br />It's the first brush that can keep all my hair in line, and thus smooth and far shinier looking, than a brush with a smaller, rounder head.<br /><br />It's plastic. The beads on the ends of the bristles have stayed on for months, so it's not flimsy and cheap.<br /><br />My daughter borrows it, even, to get the most foamy, even, glossy hair possible. She owns more brushes than I've ever had in my life, and this one is still her favorite.<br /><br />The grip is a ribbed rubber grip, so it holds steady. I love the Twilight detail. It's like I'm in the movie there with Bella and Esme and her mom, getting ready for the best day ever.
B001ERF1UW|5|Arrived in perfect shape, no cracking issues like some mailed products of this type. Lots of use, would buy more when this runs out.
B001ET6ZTG|5|Used these for years - Very satisfactory for temp pain relief from sore spots from dentures. Tomato seeds are murder.
B00KY6PJWE|5|Fast shipping.  Good~!
B000JPMHWK|5|Exactly what you'd expect.<br />Fits both my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3<br />and an off-the-shelf plastic straight razor.<br />I would buy this brand of blades again. Cuts my fine mustache hairs and delicate nose hairs flawlessly.
B0009R5BZS|4|just a little bit of the product and my hair was manageable. great price and I recommend to anyone with curly hair.
B004RC100G|5|I have been using the Exposed Skincare line for almost 2 years now, and there is a reason for that, the products are great. Almost all natural ingredients and organic extracts are used for every step of the system and is perfect for my sensitive skin. I have moderate chronic acne, and when I break out bad, its bad. The Microderm scrub is one of my favorite products by far because it does exactly what its supposed to, gives you a mini microdermabrasion treatment removing dead skin cells and providing antioxidants to relieve inflammation. It works extremely well leaving the skin ridiculously soft and clear for the next day, I use at night maybe only once or twice a week. One of the best!
B00028NBTW|3|I bought this product because I saw a segment on The Doctor Oz tv show about adrenal gland function. Siberian Ginseng is indicated for that. Ordinarily, you get all the nutrition you need from eating a normal diet. I am reducing my calories, and thought this might be helpful with vitamin C each day per the tv show. I am not sure what the Royal Jelly is doing, but I do have improved kidney function which is always good. I am of the feeling that these suppliments have a high placebo effect, so a jelly bean taken once a day might have a similar effect. The product seems to be of the highest quality. It has no taste or oder, and is a coarse gray powder in a clear gelatin capsule. Amazon had the best price, compared to local vitamin shops.
B001AY8XSQ|5|St. Ives products are not expensive but they are really nice products.  The Olive Oil cleansers works great.  Feels nice after washing and leaves your skin soft and healthly looking.  Use this all the time.
B00PHZ9BPI|5|A true elegance. Rich, creamy indulgence for men and women.
B001BW7EBY|4|Great product!  Works well to reduce scars...mostly flattening them and thinning them out a bit.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because once it dries, it flakes off (you're supposed to peel it off 2 times a day), and I find pieces of dried silicon all over my house.  Gross!  Also it smells like a chemical, so you really can't apply it and then go anywhere where you care if you smell like chemicals.  It does go away though.  I had surgery, and this product has been wonderful!
B001ES6Y5W|1|The product, upon opening, was separated and grainy.  I stirred the product and tried it.  It takes a lot of rubbing to get the grains to smooth out and possibly absorbed.  My previous jar of Shea Butter was totally creamy.  Since I opened the jar and tried the product, I shall not return it.  Is this the latest formulation, or do I have a defective product?  If this grainy glop is how the product is currently formulated, I shall not order it again. I wouldn't mind a replacement without cost, if my new jar is a fluke.  Bonnie Lang
B005N3KQW6|2|The &#34;hair&#34; used in this wig is fine and easily tangles.  Also the style in the front is odd and short leaving all the length in the back.  I ended up buying the &#34;Tengs Exclusive 32&#34;Spiral Curly Cosplay Wig&#34; and preferred the style, length and texture.
B00ADR6L08|5|I like the way it smells and it makes my hair soft. I honestly do not know if it has any other benefits for my hair though. I'm still trying to find the &#34;perfect&#34; shampoo and conditioner to strengthen my hair and help it grow faster. I'm not sure if I'll stop here.
B001DJ15KG|4|picky what I put on my skin, this is a clean nice product...smells nice
B009UOHEWO|5|I really love this tanning lotion the only bad thing is your tan may look a little orange right after but it does fade away.
B0009OAHO6|5|Love it
B0086LC0HQ|4|these make things so much easier, I liked them so went back and bought 5 more. anyone who does nails often , your own or someone elses really needs these.
B000AYKVOG|5|Works great.  My girlfriend loves it.
B000FS05VG|2|The grate on the back is very open and there's no filter. I have to be very careful when I'm drying my long hair because it sometimes gets sucked in the back and torn out of my head. OUCH! Also, the angle of the handle LOOKS cool but it means I have to bend my wrist back. I'm sure I'll get used to it but it's awkward. Not the best hairdryer I've ever had and a little dangerous.
B0039090A4|3|I ordered this product based on the good reviews but unfortunately it didn't do anything great!  Just another product to put in the closet along with the others I've tried since TIGI discontinued my favorite product.  I will say that the service and packaging were great from the seller though.
B00AYSBR96|5|Excellent product and price,  I use it all the time and in the summer, I use the one with SPF 15 in it.
B00MO78Z86|5|I have a massive amount of long, thick, slightly wavy, course hair and drying it was an event worthy of a marathon runner. It took me an average of 25 minutes to dry at high heat. I’d often brake out in a full sweat and heat the bathroom up to about the temperature of the sun every morning. When finally dry, my hair would be frizzed out and about three times the size of my head. It would take an equal amount of time to tame the frizz back down with a curling iron or flat iron just so I could walk through a doorway. Then I tried the Infiniti Pro by Conair 3Q and my life changed. One reviewer said it was equivalent to drying your hair with a leaf blower. I’d day that was accurate but in a good way. My hair is very heavy and can take the gale force wind speed of this dryer. Because it blows so hard it doesn’t get as hot which is actually better for your hair. Not only did it dry my hair faster – about 15 minutes instead of 25 – it did so without me feeling like I needed to take another shower from sweating so much. My husband is now able to come into the bathroom without feeling like he’d just stepped into the wood fire oven from Hansel and Gretel. And the best part is my hair does not frizz! It’s smooth and manageable. I don’t have to beat it into submission to get it styled the way I like. Curling it was faster because I didn’t have to first tame the frizz. This hair dryer is amazing however; it is not for the week or slight of hair. Fine or thin hair need not apply. This is a beast of a dryer and I’d recommend it to only those of us with hair like Cousin It.
B00CF45BUI|5|Pro: Works. Met expectations.<br />Con: Shipping envelope was not sealed properly.
B006Z43V38|5|An excellent product.
B000E8WSYO|5|From a trip back East, my mother brought me the Dionis lotion in the \\"Love\\" fragrance and I absolutely love it! My hands tend to be dry, but I work on a computer all day and hate using lotion that doesn't rub in and leaves my hands feeling greasy. The Dionis not only fully absorbs, but my hands feel REALLY soft.
B000P3FQCO|2|I know this product is supposed to be okay for acne-prone skin, but in my case, it was worse than most face products I have used.    Here's what happened: I bought it at Walmart, excited about trying mineral powder for the first time. I have problematic skin, but not super sensitive or bad acne. I get occassional pimples here and there, especially during hormonal times.    I used the product right away. In fact, I remember opening it up in my car in the parking lot and applying it before I went home. The coverage is WONDERFUL. It does give a flawless appearance, that's for sure! I was pretty pumped. Until about 5 hours later...    By evening, my face was all bumpy, like my face gets when I'm PMSing. I figured it must be hormonal, but just in case, I thought I'd let it clear up before I tried the product again.    A week or so later, tried it again and the same thing happened. Literally, by the end of the day, my face started to break out.    Attributing it to hormones once again (I really wanted this stuff to work!) I tried it a third time a week later. Same story. I am pretty bummed. I have had moisturizers have the same sort of effect, but never a foundation or powder since I switched to high quality, non-comedegenic projects about 10 years ago.
B005SPEWNS|1|Not good on my eyes - gloppy and hard to remove.
B0040NCGDC|5|This is my favorite brand and the price on here is good too.  I will buy it again on here.
B009PZZ70O|2|They weren't the worst I've used but the fry very easily and also tangle easily ...  I was mad that the hair was synthetic and couldn't dye ::
B00JH3K6DM|5|son likes these, says they're a bit softer than the original ones.
B001DJ6IIU|3|Kind of short on Arnica scent. Takes so much more than another brand.
B001BKRC4U|5|This is the Best Pure Maple Syrup I have ever tasted.  I understand Great Northern Maple is from the largest Maple Region in the World!  It has fresh taste....just like maple syrup used to be!
B000R6TP7G|3|After shave was not sealed or in a box like you get at a department store. Dissapointing because this is a Chhristmas gift.
B00G65XWQM|5|Works well.
B000C1Z3CW|5|I have used Poison for many years. I love it. It is my scent. I will keep on using it as long as I can get it.
B00PKIE760|5|Ohh! This stuff is amazing! So moisturizing I put it on my thighs my tummy and sides and booty, it gets like warm like you can feel it working! Will have to buy again, and soon cause I love uhhut everywhere! Thank you!
B003BQ6QXK|5|I have searched years for a shower mirror that doesn't fog up. This product works. Putting water behind the mirror is a breeze and works every time. Wish I found out about it years ago. No other product compares.  Thank you!
B00BKT7RKQ|5|It shipped fast. Everyone thought it was real hair. Does not look like a wig. Such a great price. You can't go wrong
B0067H6NU6|5|I like this company's product. It is high quality product, and the energy contained in the product is great. I like it
B000EMYHA8|4|I have had laser treatment on my legs and my hairs haven't fallen off yet. I'm very frustrated so I decided to get this tweezer in hopes of plucking out the un-fallen hairs. So far so good, but I just need to be able to learn hold it and properly use it. The tips are very sharp. It can go through your skin and pull out the hair. I tried it on an ingrown hair but I'm not sure what was wrong. Either my hair was too deep to pluck or the tweezer isn't sharp enough to get it.  At any rate, I recommend this Tweezer. You can use it to untangle things too ;P
B000NJMSEE|3|I bought this mirror for barbering. It's very sensitive and prone to sctaching.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that this mirror is a bad mirror, I just would say it's not meant to use to often, and you should keep it away from things that may scratch it.
B00021BEWU|3|If this were a LOT cheaper i'd repurchase. I always buy high end cosmetics with a few exceptions. But with this price tag its just not worth it. <br /> <br />In theory...well this is a really awesome idea. But if you want really thick long lashes then this is not the mascara for you. The best thing about this mascara is it doesn't smudge. However after a few hours and if you tend to rub your eye or cry even the tiniest bit it FLAKES and you have these things that look like eyelashes all over your cheeks. Yes, it looks like your eyelashes are falling out everywhere. My mother thought something was wrong with me because i had at least ten little flakes on my cheeks one time. They look like lashes because they form tubes around each individual lash. They're supposed to not come off unless you use soap and water and rub your lashes but i had mascara flakes everywhere. And yes REAL lashes came out too. Just like someone else complained of. I have no idea why. Still, this didn't make my eyes itchy or watery so it gets points for that. <br /> <br />If you want thick waterproof lashes try benefits badgal mascara, or any other volumizing mascara of your choice and use urban decays lingerie and galoshes primer and waterproofer to keep your mascara smudge, flake and run free even from eye rubbing and excessive crying.
B00005RHF2|5|I love this product. My hands were cracked and bleeding. Everything else I tired burned my hands and just seemed to make them worse. After only a couple of days my hands are smooth and NO CRACKS!
B004FKNYWW|5|Packaging: Like many other skinfood products this packaging is quite durable but a little clunky. If travelling you will definitely need a different container. Packaging is good at keeping excess water out though- under the twist on top there is a lid that keeps moisture out.<br /><br />Size: Size is decent for the amount you pay. You do not need to use a lot of the product to get desired effects. 1 tub lasts me at least four months with twice a week usage.<br /><br />Product: Product is smooth- almost like a lotion- but with small rice grains in it. The rice grains help to exfoliate lightly (but can be a little abrasive- would not use this to replace an actual exfoliator) and make the texture almost like a grainy pudding. Due to it being like lotion you do NOT need a lot of product to cover the face. Just gently massage a dollop around the face until the lotion has sunk into the skin, then wash it off. Leaves my complexion noticeably brighter and smoother- feels very good as well. It doesn't seem to do anything for whitening however.
B00373N8ME|1|My husband recently purchased this item for me as a Christmas gift.  I have used it a total of 10 times since I received the VaporIron on Christmas morning.  The first 2 times I used it, the iron worked wonderful, however it started shutting off about 5 minutes after I would turn it on to heat up, now it has quit coming on at all.  I am very upset and disappointed in this product!! I hate that my husband wasted that much money on something for me that doesn't even work after having it only 2 weeks.  I purchased a HairStyler Flat Iron in November 2009 and I have never had any problems with it and it still works.  Very disappointed..will not order from this place again!!
B00ILCCUN4|5|These are cute!! Arrived quickly!!
B00742JW8S|4|It works as advertised - its not battery operated..  I thought it was rechargable but its not, but overall a good product.
B0017KGOY8|5|I have had this product for a few weeks and I must say that I am pretty happy with it. It is on the large size and takes up a lot of space on my counter. But it is very handy for organizing my make up. There are trays that unfold as you open the case. It takes up a lot of space when it unfolds, but it gives you full access to all of your items. I used each case for a different type of make up - eye shadows in one, lipstick in another...there is also room in the base for larger items such as foundation. As noted in previous reviews...it was really hard to open the case when it arrived. It is locked or something. Weird. But a got a knife and figured out how to pry open the case. Overall - I think that this is a very good product and I am happy with it -- the case is just what I wanted.
B00CIX5O1C|5|PERFECT PRODUCT!
B00FFXZZV6|5|Selected as an add-on item, this was a good deal on a deep hair conditioner that provides body, volume, and thickness.
B00433Q5L8|5|I usually buy directly from the company, but this was a bit cheaper and came just as fast.  I love this smell on my husband.  Great value.
B00EHL5R5G|5|Took 8 minutes off my drying time.
B000259FZ4|5|Excellent shave.  The Emjoi is a must if you have a problem with neck acne and breakouts.  Puts the big company razors to shame.  The full kit here actually includes 12 blades -- enough to make it the better buy when you need new blades.  The blades are pretty hard to come by, so I buy them on Amazon every time.
B0036LMFYO|3|I used this soap on my face and body it is kind of harsh. Not good for sensitive skin. It caused little tiny red pimples on my face and chest.
B001PNFFLK|5|I LOVE ALL VILLAGE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS A WONDERFUK WAY TO LIVE LIFE IN A STRESS LESS<br />WAY MAKES IT ALL WORTH IT
B002G60XOY|5|great
B004TTXMQ2|5|My 22-year-old daughter asked for this for Christmas, because she had tried a sample and loved it. I saw how expensive it is, but hey, it was Christmas...she absolutely recommends this product for anyone. Works great!
B00099YMLU|5|I have been used  this product for years.<br />I think it works best for under eye bags from no sleep & to much work.<br />It goes on well. Use it 1x a Day.<br />I have seen the one eye improve in 20 min. or so.<br />Then some times it takes days.<br />I would say try the Product and see for your self.<br />For the Price , you can't bet it.
B00UVTVV3U|5|Fits and works well.
B00538TSMU|2|Bottom line is you get what you pay for... I dint like either . But the natural lashes are okay.
B00161607O|5|I wanted a bag small enough to fit in any of my purses but big enough to contact anything that might leak or stain (eye drops, cosmetics, lotion, etc.). This bag holds a lot without taking up a lot of room! And, I like that it's clear, so that I can easily locate what I'm looking for - no more rummaging through my purse!
B000PHVRYG|2|Just couldn't wait to get my Kai as I always have loved it when tried on in a store.  I was delighted when I sprayed it on, but was very disappointed to realize that the lovely fragrance barely lasts til you reach the door of the house.  Too bad, I won't buy it again for this reason.
B002XUO6LO|4|I ordered 2 tanning lotions when I received the box one was broken.  The box was clearly to small for both bottles.  I emailed the seller and they asked for me to take a picture of the broken bottle and send it to them for verification.  I did this and they had a new bottle in the mail to me quickly.
B00X1DCXOO|5|I love this cream. My skin is still moist when I wake up in the morning. And it lasts for at least six months when you use it every night.  Well worth the price!
B008TC2Y7S|5|It works great after a little practice;  I find out it cannot be used like a regular scissor.  Only a small opening of this scissor is allowed during cutting. If the scissor open like the picture shown here, it will stock.
B00DTTYF6E|5|I love how this cream doesn't feel greasy. High quality stuff! I will updare my review after using for a few weeks but my first impression is that this cream is a keeper!
B002UZ6DLI|4|So I'm not saying it doesn't work, just not as good as the was stick.  Bought this in the past from qvc and it seemed thicker then. They must have changed the formula.  But if you have sever dry skin, go with the wax man!
B00LXL261Q|5|ok
B003SEE2IQ|4|This is perfect to stay fresh on a hot day.  The scent doesn't last a long time, though.  The powder is very soft and soothing.
B0036UW5VS|5|Perfect!
B005GDBUO6|4|Smells like berries and has a nice neutral pink color, perfect for everyday wear.  It doesn't last very long so you will have to reapply it pretty often.
B002DCFFJY|5|this item was purchased to use in making clove studded oranges for the holidays.  \\"Martha\\"  made these on her TV show at the holidays and suggested this product as a good preservative.  It was hard to find, except on amazon.  The seller sent the product promptly and is someone I feel I would purchase from again -wether I am \\"crafting\\" or gardening!!!
B00544T2KQ|1|Maybe it should be called line because there was definitely no crackle! I normally use OPI Shatter but I saw Sally Hansen at Walgreen and since I normally use a lot of Sally Hansen products (The Sally Hansen HD nail polish is awesome!) I decided to try their crackle. Big mistake! I've tried it with multiple Sally Hansen nail polishes and Revlon polishes, let each coat dry for 30 minutes, tried thin coats and thick coats and it just doesn't work! Maybe I'm bias because OPI works so great but this crackle is definitely not worth purchasing! Maybe it's different in a different color but silver was awful!
B00614Q4C2|5|I love the smell and the way it makes my hands feel for hours.  It is great and long lasting.
B0009ET75Q|5|I bought this at a discount store not excepting much. In a day I seen improvements in my cuticles. I Used it on my toes and thought couldn't hurt to use on my heels ( I have very dry heels) my heels are soft in just couple days no cracking at all. I love this stuff!
B008LVCPLW|2|Wasn't too happy due to hard to hold on and cleaning is bit aggravating exspecially when u get done tanning hands get wet gloves rub it off.I have RA so that is most of the problem holding , would be nice they could get something made to help with spraying the back.
B000NDME6C|4|I thought about juicing.  But, this is so much more convenient.  It would be very hard and maybe even more expensive to juice so many fruits and veggies every day, along with adding probiotics.  This powder covers it all.  I take it on the road with me too.  The taste is also fine mixed in a smoothie.  I feel like I'm staying super healthy this way.  I just bought the all greens version (dogs can't eat grapes, etc.) for my elderly dog.  He is a cancer survivor and has weak kidneys.  So, I think this will help him too.  Now, I don't need to worry about making him fresh veggies every day either.  He lapped it up, mixed in with his goats milk yogurt and dog food.
B00E0046UG|1|to small of frame  so easy to return thank you.
B000WELSFA|5|I love the smell (lavender) and the Shea Butter is wonderful. It makes hands and feet so soft!
B000PI4J3G|5|This product is well worth it! I am a natural hair lover & I am always in need of a conditioner. It softens as you as you spray! The smell is amazing as well :)
B004AME6K4|5|This was my first time wearing curly weave and someone recamended this hair spray to me. It works great for getting out those tangles. It has a nice aroma and used with the shampoo and conditioner my remy hair was soft and bouncy.
B00DPU6ZAG|5|This piece was much better quality than I expected for this price.  I really love wearing it and always receive nice comments about it.
B008RDEI0A|5|Great
