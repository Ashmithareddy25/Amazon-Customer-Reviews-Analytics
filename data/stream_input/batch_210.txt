B00005UV96|4.0|This whole CD sounds like a mix of the Brothers' styles that they had used on their last three albums.  The Album starts with fast rockin' beats from Dig Your Own Hole.  Then it changes into psychedelic and acid kinda tracks.  Then later, tracks with vocals like \\"The States We're In\\" and \\"The Test\\" appears.  <br />Personally, I really enjoyed listening to this CD, and happy to see the Brothers coming back.
B000007R1E|5.0|I am just getting into DTS and DVD-Audio. This is a great disc! It is probably re-mastered from an earlier quadraphonic master. Regardless, the sounds is wonderful! Listen to one of the better Moody Blues albums come alive in surround sound.
044022425X|3.0|Like many others I waited impatiently for the next installment in this series.  When it finally came out I was a little bit disappointed.  There's a lot of action in the book, but I thought much of it was rather improbable (but, then again, isn't time travel improbable?).  <BR>I'm still a fan, and will wait impatiently for the next book, but I did enjoy the first four books more than &quot;The Fiery Cross.&quot;<BR>I just hope we don't have to wait as long for the next installment!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|In 1915, after a private White House screening of D.W. Griffith's silent Civil War epic Birth of a Nation, President Woodrow Wilson hailed the movie, saying, \\"It's like writing history with lightning.\\"  If any movie deserves to carry the moniker \\"written with lightning,\\" it is Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, a flamboyantly delirious post-modern spin on the creaky old \\"Let's-put-on-a-show\\" musical.<br />From its opening frames, in which an orchestra conductor wildly conducts the 20th Century Fox fanfare, it is clear that Luhrmann is not going to play to expectations.  Strains of \\"The Sound of Music\\" and \\"Nature Boy\\" lead us into Montmartre, the Bohemian corner of Paris, where a young writer named Christian (Ewan McGregor) is penning his latest tome, an ode to the only love he has ever known.<br />The opening is somber and restrained, despite some truly eye-popping visual effects that take us into Christian's world.  We are relaxed, but only for a moment.  The second Christian's story propels into flashback, the audience is thrust into a world of sights and sounds that boggle (and almost assault) the mind.  We are introduced to a bevy of bizarre characters, including John Leguizamo as a lisping Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jacek Koman as a narcoleptic Argentinian (don't ask) and Matthew Whittet as famed French composer Erik Satie.<br />It seems this group of Bohemians are looking for a new poet to provide lyrics for their latest musical offering, Spectacular Spectacular.  One sip of absinthe, and Christian has suddenly joined their band of merry men.  Of course, it helps that he is able to compose such poetic ditties as, \\"The hills are alive with the sound of music,\\" on a moment's notice.<br />It is here that we realize Luhrmann is going to populate his movie not only with a bizarre cast of characters, but they are going to be singing songs that we all know and love.  It's a risky move, but Luhrmann makes it work as an integral convention for his story.  Christian is a great and gifted poet.  What better way to demonstrate this than by having him write truly memorable poems?<br />As Christian soon learns, the Bohemians still need the backing of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent, in a role that truly shows his range), owner of the title nightclub.  And the star of the show is to be none other than Zidler's \\"sparkling diamond,\\" Satine (Nicole Kidman).  Zidler, however, has other plans, which include using Satine to secure the financial backing of an evil duke (Richard Roxburgh) to turn his Moulin Rouge from a nightclub into a legitimate theater and courtesan Satine into a legitimate actress.  Things get complicated (well, as complicated as this type of music could possibly get) when, through a case of mistaken identity, Satine and Christian wind up together and in love.<br />That's the setup, and if it sounds like it borrows from countless other stories, well, it does.  But Luhrmann knows this.  He's not interested in telling a story that's never been told before.  He wants to tell a story in a way that's never been done before.<br />To this end, Luhrmann succeeds.  After an opening act that literally never lets up (think the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, only with song and dance), he settles into his story with a comfortable pace.  We know pretty much everything that's going to happen for the next two hours, but thanks to Luhrmann's sometimes wacky sense of humor and truly phenomenal performances by his actors, it just doesn't matter.<br />Of course, Moulin Rouge! is a musical, so the quality of its musical numbers certainly play a large role in the movie's success.  And to that end, the big question for those who haven't seen the movie yet is, \\"Can Nicole and Ewan really sing?\\"  Well, the answer is yes and no.  McGregor's voice is the better of the two, strong and confident like a chorus line singer determined to get the agents to sit up an notice.  Occasionally, he tries a little too hard (in one of the movie's final songs, heactually spits in Kidman's face), but that's all in keeping with the grand operatic passion that Luhrmann is trying to capture.<br />Kidman can carry a tune, although she scoops up to some of her notes, and she sometimes seems a little unsure of herself.  But her acting more than makes up for it.  Her ability to range from light (very light) comedy to chest-thumping tragedy is truly remarkable.  In her opening number (\\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\"), she displays a kittenish quality for which none of her previous performances has prepared us.  And on top of that, thanks to Donald McAlpine's lush photography, she has simply never been more beautiful.  If audiences didn't know better, they could easily mistake her for a movie goddess from the Golden Age.<br />Broadbent shines in every scene he's in, almost stealing the entire movie away from its leads with his hilarious take on Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin.\\"  Roxburgh is a fitting, if two-dimensional villain, while Leguizamo is reduced to only a few minor bits, none of which demonstrate the actor's incredible talents or the character's depth.<br />But minor quibbles aside, Moulin Rouge! is not so much a movie as it is an experience.  As Luhrmann has explained in interviews, the Moulin Rouge itself was the ultimate nightclub.  The rush that people got from going to Zidler's electrified extravaganza in the 1890s is the same feeling modern audiences get from going to a great club with an awesome DJ.  So, to give today's audiences that same feeling, Luhrmann has hired today's hottest remixers (including FatBoy Slim and Missy Elliott) to help fashion his musical statement.  And he has cut his movie into quick edits, never once letting his camera sit still.<br />Some have complained about Moulin Rouge!'s use of previously written songs, but again, this is a cultural statement that Luhrmann is making.  Today's musical culture is rapidly becoming more and more dependent on sampling.  So Moulin Rouge! is the first \\"sampled\\"movie, which could place it on the brink of a new post-modern movement in film.  Only time will tell.<br />20th Century Fox's new DVD edition of the movie is a truly remarkable achievement, as well.  It is chock full of extras (some of which, admittedly, seem to have been created and included just to garner Oscar nominations for the movie...talk about timing), and incorporates some of the same technology that made The Matrix a standout DVD (instead of white rabbit, here we have a green fairy directing us to memorable behind-the-scenes clips), but takes it to a new level with some of the best behind-the-scenes production ever filmed.  This is a must-have DVD and the best DVD of 2001 (which was already a great year for DVD advancements).
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer is the most important band of the past decade and I will not accept debate on the subject. Fusing the bitterness of grunge, the tongue in cheek quality of alternative rock, and the song structure of more established classic rock, Weezer changed the way the general public listens. Every band in the past 5 years takes its cues from Weezer, especially the TRL style pop rock that I'm sure the boys from Weezer despise. Blink-182's sense of humor and funny videos? That's classic Weezer. Check out the Buddy Holly video. Matchbox 20's emotional lyrics? That's the stamp Rivers puts on all his songs, but in a much bigger and better way. The apathy that consumes America's youth is not a disease; its a lot of fun; this is the message Weezer embodies and exemplifies on this, their brilliant debut album.
B00005JKQX|1.0|You've already seen this movie.  You don't need to see it again.  A Beautiful Mind never once rises above the merely serviceable.  It never rises above the level of the usual fairly competently made TV movie.  <br />Emotional payoffs are telegraphed a full two hours in advance.  The music swells dramatically to tell you to start crying.  It's almost like a Spielberg film, except that Ron Howard doesn't have Spielberg's considerable talents.<br />Russell Crowe does a fairly good job, but all too often is content just to bring out a series of ticks and grins and mumbles.  He basically gets by on his considerable charisma and charm.  If the film is at all watchable, it is due to him.  Ed Harris does next to nothing, and basically makes the easiest paycheck of his entire career.  <br />There is really no reason to see this film.  There are better motion pictures out there.  You'll easily find one.  Just look.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This album has to be heard to be believed! Bob Dylan has never sounded more self assured and confident in years. Every song seems to have something all it's own. Ranging from the blues track &quot;High Water&quot; to the great track &quot;Floater&quot; to unbelievable blues on &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot;, this is a must for any collection. Unfortunately all the years of recording and touring have shredded his voice. However his style and uncanny wordplay along with a fantastic backup band have made this a minor point. This is also a great party record. Listen to &quot;Cry A While&quot; and guaranteed the house to be rocking. He even does a great job on the rockabilly styled tune &quot;Summer Days&quot;. Bravo to Bob Dylan for a great job all around. If he's past his prime you couldn't tell from listening to this album.
B00005RIKD|5.0|This CD is more than I expected. All of the best Sting cuts done in a jazz genre that makes the soul ache with sweet pain. Who else could re-record their own works and make it happen all over again.  I especially love &quot;Roxanne&quot;.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|I'm afraid I must agree with arabellafig. It isn't exactly poorly done, but it could be far far better, and suffers badly from comparison with Emma Thompson's \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" and of course with A&E's exquisite \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" but it could be far, far better. I too had high hopes after reading so many glowing reviews, the story will always be memorable, but it is almost a filmed version of Cliff's Notes on Austen's original tale. It runs 104 minutes to S&S 136 to P&P's 6 volume set. Why? Perhaps it was designed around television commercial space.<br />What particularly grated was the casting and much direction which was strangely off. The eldest sister Elizabeth is pissy and crude although she has been in charge of Sir Walter's social responsibilities and second only to him in \\"precedence\\" since her mother's death. It is not necessary to have her slouch in a chair and throw papers about in a pout to establish her character as a bad egg. Neither one, especially Ann, is believable as daughter of nobility and the upper class. Ann in particular clomps about clumsily, starts, scuttles, and hides. One can hardly imagine her daring to give an order to anyone (other than calling for a doctor after Louisa's fall) although giving orders to servants is her station in life. The very elegant and lovely and believable Lady Russell has been her close companion and surrogate mother since Ann lost her own mother at 14 - and this is the result? Compare to Lady Russell herself, to the S&S apparently lower ranking Eleanor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) saying her farewells to the servants or the elegant creature who Marianne Dashwood discovers to be her replacement, or to P&P Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. Rather than an image of a Lady of gentle quietness, forebearance and resignation, she seems more a scared rabbit. I could see her in the role of the starting, clomping, bewildered maid in P&P being ordered to stop working on Lizzy's hair and attend to Miss Jane. She does the staring traumatized eyes quite well however, so they are featured in nearly every scene. The hypochondriac youngest daughter Mary is well acted - but she even seems older than Ann.<br />What is NOT featured is any kind of dialogue that would establish the character that is claimed for her. We have only the doormat behavior to establish deference to others; the blandishments of the scheming Mr. Elliott on skill at Italian; the final speech overheard by Capt. Wentworth. We should be allowed to see more of her than what is filtered through her blind and belittling family, not less.<br />P&P actually added character development - for example, not until the scene at the Rosings pianoforte did it occur to me that part of Mr. Darcy's problem just might be that he is as naturally shy as his sister, or why Georgiana had specifically NOT been entrusted to the tender care of Lady Catherine. Edward in S&S was beautifully developed through Margaret's Atlas (in a wonderful scene that does not exist in the book).<br />I don't suppose I will never ever watch it again, but it has sent me back to re-read the novel. A good thing, that, as is the reminder that a wonderful story does not automatically make a wonderful movie all on its own - and the critical impact of good direction, the overall artistry of casting, lighting, staging, landscape. One of the things I love about DVDs (such as S&S) is the opportunity to listen to scene commentary by the actors and directors, to understand how very much goes into the making of a good or great film, how little into poor or merely adequate ones.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and then after hearing it I got it for myself. It is just fantastic. I actually find myself being one of those people who sing while driving without caring if anyone is watching. &quot;83&quot; is great with so many reminders of high school. &quot;Back to You&quot; seeps into your head and stays there. This is a great feel good mix of humor and romance and not at all like the initial reviewer described. If I were to mix Dave Matthews, Willie Porter and Ben Folds this is what you would get. So get it!!
0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut does what so few other modern authors are able to: create important yet easily consumed literature. The latter half of the 20th century was far from the golden age of books with most novels written falling into the category that I kindly label \\"Pulp.\\" In short, John Grisham, Tom Clancy, and the like are not changing the way we think. Vonnegut, in contrast is. This dryly witty commentary on war actually means something. Its about violence, its about inter personal relationships, its about the way we think and act as human beings and animals. These themes are sometimes hard to spot but the text is never hard to handle. The books is not long winded and it reads quickly. A perfect fit for a first time Vonnegut reader or anyone who was born with even the smallest cynical streak.
0792839692|5.0|I remember when I wrote an article about the 20th Anniversary of this science fiction classic. Five years later, I still think the movie is a spectacular science fiction, trail blazing adventure. And yet, to this day, it is still my favorite film of all time. People may still stare at me funny when I tell them this, however, it still is my opinion.<br />MGM's 1976 science fiction classic not only won two Academy Awards, it had also created a huge cult following that still keeps going strong to this day. It has not only withstood the test of time, it still a spectacular film to watch. Sir Michael York, the late Richard Jordan, Jenny Agutter, Peter Ustinov, Farrah Fawcett, and Roscoe Lee Brown did a remarkable job in the roles that they were given. Ustinov should have won the Oscar for his role as the Old Man. The film also had set a pre-Star Wars box office record, a year before that film had been released. Not only is it an awe-inspiring post-apocalyptic science fiction adventure...it really taps into some serious social commentary and presents the audience a future that could evolve, if the human race continues to wreak havoc on the world. Even in the 23rd Century.<br />If you are looking for some excitement and entertainment, you need not look any furthur than Logan's Run. It sure beats watching Star Trek, Star Wars, and Babylon 5 any day of the week.<br />*Special note - the fight scene between Logan and Francis in the remains of Washington D.C. as well as the death of Francis, reflected a unique form of symbolism. Francis tries to kill Logan with a torn up American flag. Logan kills Francis with the flag and its pole. The movie was released in June of 1976 and Sir Michael York is British. Food for thought...
B000000OSO|5.0|I've been a fan of Aerosmith for about four years now, and this is the fourth album by them that I've heard. Amazing or not, I like them all. The band is a legend already, and I believe that they'll be remembered as one of the greatest bands. The have their own unique sound, which you either like or not. I like it.<BR>The album starts with Intro, a nice little piece of music. From thet we can smoothly move to Eat the Rich. The lyrics are fun, and this is a true Aerosmith rock song. After that comes the title song, Get A Grip. I have to warn you; someone burps loud at the very beginning of the song! Grip is another rock song, and Tyler's voice raises and raises in the &quot;I get so excited&quot; -part so that you'd think he'd explode any time. Fever comes after that; at first I didn't like the song, but then I got excited about it. Sounds to me a bit like Rolling Stones, and I also love Tyler's harmonica. Livin' On the Edge is probably the most famous song from this album, but it just doesn't chill me that much. Flesh is a bit like Fever, and once again we can hear the Demon Of Screaming at his best. This is a very energetic song. Walk On Down is Joe Perry saying &quot;Hey I have a good song too, let's put it on the album!&quot; I'm glad they listened to Joe as Walk On Down is easy-going but full of rock. Shut Up And Dance is one of my favorites, a rock song that makes you want to dance as they tell you to. And when you are tired after hard dancing, you can relax by listening to Cryin'. I like the song, but the live version on Little South Of Sanity is much better, it's a gem while this version sounds like a bad recording of a song that could have been better. The next song, Gotta Love It is my favourite. It rocks, has depth and power. It reminds me of Michael Jackson's Give In To Me (Dangerous, 1991), and if you like Give In... because of the song, not just because of Michael Jackson, you gotta love this song too (or other way round; if you like this you'll like Give In To Me). Crazy follows this song, another ballad which is pretty good. I'm just sad that they picked the ballads for singles, why not Flesh for example. But Aerosmith makes great ballads, so... you'll probably go crazy for this song. Line Up features Lenny Kravitz, but it's not the most interesting song in this album. Can't Stop Messin' became one of my favorites; at first I thought the beginning was too sudden, but now I can't get enough of it. Amazing, amazingly another famous slow ballad... good but don't listen to it too often so you won't get bored. Boogie Man comes silently from nowhere, stops by to float in your mind and after it has faded away it'll still float in your brain. Spooky.<BR>I don't want to say anything stupid like &quot;buy this cd&quot; or &quot;this is the best&quot; or &quot;vote for my review&quot; but I don't actually know what to say. Boogie Man is still filling my mind.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|I rated this movie a long time ago.  I don't know what I was thinking when I gave this movie 4 stars.  When I look back I can't believe I liked this movie.  Now when I see it I hate this movie.  I have to re-rate it.  This movie is a piece of trash and is very immature.  A five-year old could write a better script.  It is just a typical gross-out comedy that finds any excuse to put a ... on the screen in order to get a shock out of the viewer.  I am sure that many people who watched it then probably feel the same way about it now.  It isn't even very good at spoofing other movies.  I will not go into detail because it is so simple, it makes fun of teen horror movies.  I am also not going into detail because this movie is a piece of trash for those who think they aren't trash.
B000001DTM|5.0|As I was driving in my car today, in the middle of the traffic jam, I just put in the old cassette in my car's stereo. The cassette shrieks a bit and plays on with the album's opening drum attack....&quot;I'm ready....&quot;<br />Man! How I have been listening for this album for a long time, ever since it came out in '91. As what others said, nobody actually believed that U2 could top &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; and its widescreen music and thumping bass lines. I guess it is all true that only true GREAT bands (Pink Floyd could top off Dark Side of the Moon with The Wall or Wish You Were Here) could pull off another ace from its sleeve. Taking inspiration from Bowie's so called &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; (even though he only recorded one in Hansa) U2 puts on a giant mask and play with irony, which is not their nature as artists. They were put in the corner as they put their hearts on their sleeves and labelled as &quot;Taking themselves too seriously&quot; <br />Like Bono once said how they were so misquoted &quot;I said that we were making a DENSE record, and the media quoted it as a DANCE record&quot; but its true color really shines through. Putting some dysfunctional lyrics to mask its blood and guts, check out the wordsmith (Bono) and aching guitar drill from The Edge, or the lazy bass lines from Adam and punctual beats from Larry. No wonder nobody could get their sound like U2, because they are not TECHNICALLY correct musicians! Their sound is truly their own collective efforts and imagination. <br />I guess most people agree that in the beginning nobody could truly understand what U2 were up to with this album, heck even the title could not be taken too seriously. &quot;One&quot; became the most played tune off this album that even Axl Rose (remember him) played too many times in his car. &quot;So Cruel&quot; for The Edge's bitter divorce, &quot;The Fly&quot; Preacher in disguise and many more.<br />This is the &quot;Dark Side of The Moon&quot; for the '90s, an accomplished album with its mission and mask fully embraced by the public, in which U2 could put their alter ego mask on and keep their integrity intact. Read the excellent book about U2 &quot;U2 at the End of the world&quot; by Bill Flanagan to appreciate more about the creative force behind the mixing console, the legendary tour, the marathon process for the follow up &quot;Zooropa&quot;, the Bill Clinton meeting, etc...The only complaint for otherwise a fantastic album is about the recording which could've been improved for its clarity and focus.<br />Personally I loved the tune the owners loved the less &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; which reminds me of a girl that is going to get married next week. Funny how times have changed but the music remains the same.
B000005HLV|1.0|The vocals are awful; really dumb high pitched growls, the recording is equally as bad, and the guitars are not good at all.  The only thing is fast drumming--which does not make a good band.  I highly recommend that if you see this album in stores take it and burn it.  Also if you think about buying this, do yourself a favor and check into a Mental Institution.
B00000064G|5.0|The essention of his music is caught on this one.<BR>Timeless, stark, haunting.
B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks will always have a special place in my heart, as the best, most memorable show ever aired on television. This superb DVD transfer allowed me to re-live the experience in fine fashion -- and yes, Bob still scares the hell out of me! If they can do the same for season two, I'll be the first in line to buy it.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I love this movie!<BR>It is so cool!<BR>I love the action and the thrill that this movie has!<BR>And the story is great!<BR>Thise is a great movie!
B00005U11Z|5.0|This DVD is amazing to say the least. In fact, being a young fan who has not been exposed to older bands, it was watching part of this concert that got me hooked in the first place. With a few fresh cuts from their new album Arrival tossed in with some of the classics like &quot;Faithfully&quot; and &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot;, there's no way this DVD can be anything less than awesome. Proof that great music never goes out of style!
B00005NTJK|3.0|\\"Benefit\\" is not GREAT album. It is a very good one, but very uneven. It was one of the first Tull albums I bought when I firts got into the band about 12 years ago, so I do have a special place for it in my heart. But, time has given me some objectivity.<br />The lead of track, \\"With you there to help me\\" is fantastic... so is \\"For Michael Collins, Jeffery and Me\\"... \\"Inside\\" and \\"To cry you a song\\" are very, very good. From there, throughout the album , you'll find some good bits, but those are definitely the rather obvious high points. The old version of this CD had \\"Teacher\\" as part of the album... I've never onwed this on anything other than CD and Tape, so I don't know if it should be an album track or not. Anyway, the included version is great, and \\"Teacher\\" is definitely gold-star material. <br />The reissue is a pretty lean package, but the sound is better overall, although even that might be arguably. The old CD was brighter sounding with more tape hiss. This new issue is darker and more recessed. It has better dynamic, overall, but the \\"life\\" seems sucked out of the recording along with all the hiss... matter or opinion, I guess. There are a couple of bonus tracks... would have liked more. They could have filled out the disc. ... Compared to another recent Hollywood and Vine reissue series of another of my favorite groups, The Beach Boys, I give this series the thumbs down: I like how the BB albums are two-on-one CD and full-priced. It's just more convenient. In fact, I don't plan on buying all of the Tull reissue--- just the albums I really love. I'm looking foward to some of the underrated later stuff--- \\"Heavy Horse\\", \\"Storm watch\\" \\"Broadsword\\", etc.
0345440757|3.0|There are alot of helpful insights in this book but I don't recommend reading it until your baby is at least 2 months old, and you are more in tune with her needs and personality.  I started reading this book as soon as I came home with my daughter and it drove me crazy.  Instead of really paying attention to my baby, I was trying to space her feedings (the book says babies should eat every 2 1/2 to 3 hours).  Now at 3 months old my baby still breastfeeds a full meal every two hours.  <BR>Just take this book with a grain of salt, and read other more objective books like &quot;What to Expect...&quot;.  The best parts of the book are on reading your baby's body language, and also the GENERAL routine of E.A.S.Y.  :  Eat, Activity, Sleep, and You.<BR>Don't take the book too seriously like I did.
B00000J7JO|4.0|Noticeably more mature work than the masterpiece &quot;BloodSugarSexMagik,&quot; &quot;Californication&quot; contains more storytelling and a different kind of message with more complex melodies and more subtle instrumentation.  But the Chili Peppers still rock, and this album is no exception.
B00000IRED|4.0|The story itself is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely not the first to ponder the idea of \\"a real life in an fake world\\", but \\"The Truman Show\\" somehow seems refreshingly different from other films using variations this theme. <br />I'm not sure what makes \\"The Truman Show\\" so unique. Perhaps its the fact that the \\"Big Brother\\" of the film is an ordinary flesh-and-blood TV director rather then some powerful futuristic technology (as in \\"Matrix\\") or some mysterious supernatural force (as in the \\"Twilight Zone\\"). Whether for this reason or another, the story clicks in as a masterpiece.<br />Based on the storyline alone, this could have been the movie of the year, or even the movie of the decade. Unfortunately, nearly all other aspects of the film are nowhere that good. <br />Starting with the script. The details of the script of the movie sometimes spoil good points in the story. A good example of this is the very end of the film. The idea for the story's end is excellent, but it looks rather disappointing on film. <br />As for the acting, it isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. The guy playing the TV Director Christof is excellent and Jim Carrey is pretty good as Truman, but overall the acting simply isn't that impressive.<br />Other tidbits prove that the producers didn't think too much about making the film consistent. For example, it says that Truman is \\"10913 days on the air, and he was born in front of a live audience\\" when it supposed to be near his 30th birthday. This is more than a month off. Just how hard is it to multiply 30 by 365 (or 365 1/4 if you are really picky) and get the right number? It may be unimportant to the plot, but such errors point to the lack of seriousness on the producer's part.<br />To sum things up:<br />I give the film 6 stars (that's no typo) for the storyline, and 2 stars for the preformence. Overall, a 4-star movie.
0345448898|5.0|I've never before read a book quite as good as this one.<BR>I bought a three book in one type and just could't stop reading it.<BR>Amazing storyline and has left a strong lasting impression on me 3 weeks on after finishing it.<br />I recommened it to eeryone young or old, anyone and everyone will enjoy this book
B00005RFAI|3.0|P!NK as she decided to be known on this album took her RnB style and chucked it out the window.  WHY OH WHY!!!!  POP ROCK was now her game - cleaverly pre-empting the angst ridden trash that filled MTV to bursting today, yet never squarley fixing a definitive style (shame).  A great talent was evident in her debut album & sadly her third (most recent) work appears to display a spirling career towards the bargin bin of your local wal-mart before long.
6305428220|5.0|I didn't see this movie until after I saw the recent Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  After seeing Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, I couldn't wait to see all of his other movies.  The Faculty is excellent, with a great cast and plot.  Although some scenes might gross out the weak-stomached people, I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves horrer, or who just wants to see some great acting!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Ha Ha Ha, I'm just laughing because I can't believe how much bad reviews this is getting. First of all the movie was OK not horrible or bad. I have seen like 1,200 movies since I was 5 years old and this is not horrible. This movie was to focused on a young audience and forgot about us adults and I didn't really like Jar Jar, he was for kids. The movie was a little boring in some parts but I guess this episode is more of an introduction to the whole story. The best part was the end fight, and I wish there was more Darth Mull and fighting. The DVD itself is very good and this is what all DVD packs should be like.<BR>Nuff said.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I just saw the DVD of Moulin Rouge and was blown away for a couple of reasons. First, I got this very strange feeling that not only do I look like Zidler, the all powerfull owner of the Moulin Rouge and top perv, but I kind of idenbtified with him, and, second, there must be a lot of people that bought the DVD, and, when in the first five minutes realized that there is no crime, there is no killer, no lawyer and the plot is not clear, must have felt that they made a big big mistake ... <br />The movie/musical has all the great elements to be a cult favorite with old perverts enjoying the fruits of life, young nubile dancing women,contemporary song hits blended into the story, and, of course, where would we be without the obligatory  bunch of crazy midgets .... <br />If you enjoy Broadway shows, musicals, operas, or the ballet then you will probably enjoy this wonderfull work of art. The visuals are stunning and the use of popular hits from Elton John, Queen, Madonna et. al. with a period piece, set in the decadent 1900 nightclub Moulin Rouge, not only works but is memorable.<br />Finally, anyone that buys this DVD for the story must be out of their minds and probably never ever saw an opera where I believe they actually give prizes for far fetched stupid stories (the opera La Tutti Van Tutti really comes to mind here) ..... So, if you can withstand operas like that you will love Mounlin Rouge ....
B00004XOWM|3.0|In review, this is probably the highest point nu-metal ever reached.  It's a classic of its time & the live show that toured this album was second to none, but sadly it has dated in a very short time.   Thanks for the memories Bizkit - it just never got any better than this.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Just when you thought all sci-fi movies are bland, boring &amp; too much like all the other ones.<BR>Just when you thought all horror movies are a repeating the same thing over and over again.<BR>Then came PitchBlack to keep you on the edge of your seat. I find that the audio is one of the best (if you use DTS).<BR>The end of the movie is somewhat dissapointing: Vin should not have said &quot;not for me&quot;. Understandable that there had to be an ending but not like he just found jesus again.
0800177177|5.0|This is the best rendition of Dracula to date. The camera work and special FX are wonderful along with a superb cast. Oldman is perhaps the most diverse actor alive today. The gothic atmosphere and period costumes seem to come alive as the story unfolds. The best horror film to come out of hollywood in a long time. I do not see any picture quality issues that some have described with the blu-ray edition as it looks and sounds better than any previous release and I have owned the vhs and dvd previous to purchasing the blu-ray.
B00005R23S|5.0|Just got this DVD and for the life of me don't really know why I hand't bought it when it first came out .... OK OK maybe I listened too much to some nit pickety comments about sequencing, questions about the 5.1 dolby and even things missing from some of the shows ....  that was dumb of me, cause I want to tell you, this DVD is super and will rock your socks .... <br />To begin with the DVD contains 25 song tracks and lasts over 3 hours .. yup you heard me, 3 hours which I might add is more than double most concert DVD's today ... Talk about bang for your buck, I just bought a few Latin Jazz concert VHS and got 29 minutes at 17.00 .... WOW <br />On the technical side, the camera work is stupendous and seems to follow your eyes as to what you would have been watching if you were at the concert, the editing is great, video clear and crisp and the sound, may not be studio quality, but for a concert it's fabulous.<br />Of the few fabled rockers that cut concert DVD's like the Stones and Fleetwood Mack this is a must have addition to the party collection .....
B000002WU9|5.0|Any way you cut it, Raekwon's 1st joint is a classic hip-hop album.  It plays almost like a movie, with tight, no-frills production, and slammin' turns by Ghostface Killah, and of course, the Chef's classic lyrics.  The LP clearly delves into fantasies about drug deals with Italians and Colombians, as well as assassination plots, but never crosses the line into outright stupidity.<br />Unfortunately, imitation ain't the best form of flattery.  In the year it was released, EVERYBODY was trying to \\"shark-bite\\" the \\"Cuban Linx\\" motif, and the LP spawned tons of imitators, to the point that De La Soul blasted them in their own classic, \\"Stakes is High\\" (the track \\"Itsowezee\\").  Raekwon may have unfortunately opened a Pandora's box that never closed.  He could be deemed the \\"Godfather of Bling-Bling.\\"<br />Nothing beats the original.  Check this LP out.
B00004Z459|5.0|This may seem like just another alternative group, but I am from Seattle and its is much more than that.  They combine punk, rap, and, rock into an amazing sound.  This is one of the best cd's I own, not a bad song on the whole disc.
0060977493|5.0|I've read quite a varied bunch of books in my time, but Roy's \\"God of Small Things' is definitely the first book that comes to mind when you say 'favourite'.<BR>I find it incredibly textured. The little word games that the characters play remind me so much of my own youth.<BR>I grew up in India, though not in the locale that Roy's book features, and I remeber my childhood games mirroring those that Rahel and Estha play... nictitating, ictitating, titating, etc\\"<BR>I felt every character in the book, whether I loved them or hated them. The sense of little pleasures and ultimate hopelessness that the tale embodies is incredible and feels disturbingly like truth. The nice thing about it is that although it's a sad story, you don't end it bitterly. Roy picked the perfect scene to end the book with. Had she chosen any other, I think I'd have been too disturbed to ever want to read it again.<BR>To me, it is one of the great stories.... one that does not trick you with a surprise ending. It is one that you can enter at any point and inhabit comfortably; as familiar as the scent of your lover's skin.<BR>Because, in the great stories, we already know what happens;who lives and who dies, who finds love and who doesn't; but we want to know again.. just as although we know that one day we will die, we live as though we won't.<br />If you like texture and description in writing, starve for two days if you have to, but have a pretty copy of this book.<BR>I've actually got two copies: one hardbound and one paperback which I keep for my own use, and a separate copy for the sole purpose of lending out to friends that I think will appreciate it.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is phenomenal.  It is one of my all-time favorites.  Brilliant songwriting and production.  Lauryn Hill's songs are full of emotion, conviction, and intelligence.  She is a musical genius.  The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a must have for any music collection.
0618002227|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT book! I do not want to put it down. The ring has truly got me and is pulling me into this book. The closer I get to the end of it, the heavier it is. I can't wait to get into the other books.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|A great Disney film with everything you expect from animation. I especially like the dual wide-screen/full-screen feature which lets you choose how to view the film. This is a must for any Disney collection if not any DVD collection.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I just had to write a review after reading all the negative ones posted earlier, I am probably different from many of the prior reviewers as not only am i a big No Doubt fan, but i am also a big fan of Jamaican Dancehall music, and when i heard that No doubt was trying out a 'new' style i knew it just had to be Dancehall music (otherwise known as Ragga music if u're from Europe). No doubt has delved into all the other Jamaican styles i.e. Ska, Reggae and Rock Steady, so this was no surprise to me.  what i need to clear up b4 i talk about the musical merits of the album is that Hey Baby, start the fire, and Rock steady are dancehall/Ragga songs, not pop, hip hop or Electronica!!.<BR>The songs that probably hit me the most were Hella good, Hey Baby, Underneath it all, Don't let me down, Start the fire and Rock steady, the other songs grew on me after a while<BR>All in all a very good album, that i can't stop listening to.
B00005U1YO|4.0|Come with us does nothing new, breaks no new ground, yet it will stay in my rotation for a long time.  It is a well mixed, well thought out effort from the brothers that mainstreamed dance.  No songs really stick out, but the album flows extremely well and, as is typical for the Chemical Brothers gets you going with catchy phrasing and pounding bass lines that get you out of your chair (which is more than I can say for Tweekend!).  Still, I am waiting for these guys to do something daring that will turn everyones head and have the industry saying: &quot;Why did'nt we do that earlier!&quot;  Hopefully the next record will push the envelope, but until then we have a very strong effort that is in no way a dissapointment.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Baz Luhrmann's \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was so good that it defies belief. It was easily one of my favorite movies of 2001, and with luck it may even help spark a new wave of great musical films.<br />Ewan McGregor (\\"Star Wars Episode I\\") plays a young writer in turn-of-the-century Paris who falls in love with a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman again) who yearns to be a real actress. The movie uses pop and rock hits of recent years to advance the plot, and Luhrmann's garish style that was so bad in \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" actually works this time around. This is a beautiful, tragic movie that anyone who loves musicals has to watch.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Get yours while you can. When the last disc is sold, that's it for a few years. This is an amazing DVD, full featured and loaded to the brim with everything you ever wanted to know and some things that never crossed your mind about Snow White. Disney's first full length &quot;animated feature&quot; made history and is still a sight to behold. The guided tours are easy to navigate, and the package is high quality. What else would you expect for &quot;the one that started it all&quot;? This is what DVD was intended for, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs makes its mark on the technology.
B000002V07|5.0|&quot;five string serenade&quot;, &quot;into dust&quot; .....simple and beautiful.<BR>low light, candles, incense (if you like it).  Kick back and enjoy.
B00005QDW1|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Stefani and the band, but they seem to be getting worse with each album.  Their first single of this record, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; sounds like something a couple of 15 year old kids would write because they didn't feel like doing their homework.  It's so annoying, I can't hit the radio dial fast enough to change the station!  If the band were still unknowns trying to make it, every producer in the land would easily pass on this album.  It's almost like &quot;We're big, we're famous, we don't have to write and record anything well written anymore.&quot;  Come on guys.. you can do better.
B00005T30L|5.0|It's a shame that junk like \\"Tomcats\\" gets a wide release while gems like this, \\"Ghost World,\\" never make it to the big movie theaters. Terry Zwigoff  directs this film, an adaptation of the comic book by Daniel Clowes. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson star as two recent high school graduates who, the summer after their senior year, begin to grow up and grow apart. Birch strikes up an odd relationship with a reclusive music lover played by Steve Buscemi (\\"Fargo\\"), which only serves to further the wedge between the girls. It's difficult to say what this movie is about, except to say that it's one of the most original coming-of-age stories done in years, something that will very much be worth looking for on video.
6305014140|1.0|Ninja Scroll is a huge disappointment for any fan of intelligent story telling.  This ridiculously butchered telling of historical events is sheer fantasy and was more painful to watch than Mel Gibson's \\"Braveheart.\\"<br />This sort of drivel may appeal to horny fratboys who cheer as the blood sprays and women are raped, but to anime fans who prefer substance, this is a waste of time.  Go watch Evangelion or Grave of the Fireflies.

B00005OAIE|5.0|Mayer was just named one of the best new artists of 2001 by Rolling Stone magazine. Maybe the reviewer needs to get himself a new set of headphones.
B00003CY6M|4.0|In the realm of romantic comedies, where most films often look like carbon copies of each other, \\"Serendipity\\" stood out this year. John Cusack (\\"High Fidelity\\") and Kate Beckinsale (\\"Pearl Harbor\\") play a pair of strangers who try to find each other seven years after having one magical night together. The film is sweet and funny and features the always-good and grossly underrated Jeremy Piven as Cusack's sidekick.<br />Normally a film that relied on coincidence as much as this does would bother me, but since the very theme is that of fate, destiny and happy accidents, it actually works in the movie's favor. It's not a brilliant movie, but it's a lot of fun and worth catching.
6305265488|5.0|Ever After is a great take on the classic Cinderella story. I loved the touch that references to Sir Thomas More's Utopia gave. Drew Barrymore puts in a pretty good performance as Cinderella, but I found her acting a little fake at times. Dougray Scott is wonderful (in looks and acting) as the dashing prince, and Anjelica Huston plays a totally convincing and detestable step mother. The music and scenery and costumes are all very lovely. I found the ending a bit too abrupt-I guess I just want stories like this to go on and on!
0688170528|3.0|This story of a teenage suicide pact gone bad is really two genres in one.  It is told in present time and flashback, through alternating chapters.  Think \\"Law & Order.\\"  The present story, called \\"Now,\\" is a competent legal thriller, centering on whether or not the surviving teen is guilty of murder.  The interlaced flashbacks, called \\"Then,\\" tell a love story of the ill-fated teens and their close families. Overall, the author's method is not successful.  The present story is far more compelling than the back story, which constantly kills the pace of the book. The other big problem is credibility.  Many of the situations just do not ring true, including the abrupt ending.  Still, the characters are compelling and there's a bang-up trial sequence, so the book is recommendable as a good beach or airplane read. But that seems far short of what Ms. Picoult was aiming for here.
B000006045|4.0|It's *almost* there, but not quite. The CD has tracks I'd be happy to buy as singles -- brilliant pieces like \\"Angel\\", \\"Inertia Creeps\\", and \\"Teardrop\\" among others make this CD one worth owning. However, it is not as consistent as one would like -- listening to it (as one tends to do at night, rather than day, with Massive attack) feels like flashes of light in the darkness. Those flashes are worth it, but the rest keeps the CD from being an all-out five-star buy.<br />But then again, it is rare to come across a perfect, polished gem of a CD. Maybe I'm just being picky.<br />This CD DOES rock, and you SHOULD buy it!
B000001Y79|5.0|&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; is classic, that is all I can say despite not even being 7 years old, numerous songs off this album have classic status, such as the ballad &quot;Don't Speak&quot;. This was the breakthrough album for No Doubt giving them national and worldwide exposure and a legion of fans. Gwen Stefani has the right attitude, look, and voice to be a lead singer and she is phenomenal. The Standout songs on this album are: &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Excuse me Mr&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Happpy Now&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and of course &quot;Don't Speak&quot;. Don't Speak&quot; has to be one of the best power ballads of all time up there with &quot;I Will always love you&quot; by Whitney Houston. My favorite song off of the album is &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; very upbeat and happy song. This album made No Doubt who they are today, and it's a shame to think they they almost never finished this album, the 11 million people that have bought this album are glad that they did finish it. A must Buy.
0679428887|2.0|Robert Harris is the author of two fine novels in 'Enigma' and 'Fatherland', and now that he has completed his third, the tally remains at two.<br />Pick up an armful of books at a secondhand store and you will find plenty worse than this, but whereas his others are intricate and deep and written with passion, this came across to me as a constipated potboiler, eked out to make some more dosh. Yes, his eye for detail is still there, and so is his technical ability as a writer; these in themselves were sufficient to keep me turning the pages, even if it was with a somewhat leaden hand.<br />Given that every single character is unpleasant, and that the plot is intrinsically ludicrous, one could argue that he has done well with the material he gave himself. I say that because, despite all this, the book certainly has its moments, and Harris conjures up such vivid images of the greyness and squalor of contemporary Russia that they somehow seem romantic and evocative.<br />In summary, if you ever get a ten year stretch in Sing-Sing, mark this down for reading in about Year Eight. In Year One though, sit down with Enigma and Fatherland, both of which are outstandingly good books, and in a different class to this.
B00000064F|5.0|This is by far my favorite Nick Drake album. And indeed it is his best. I will never understand those who criticize the &quot;elevator&quot; strings on this album. I think they are used quite well, and do not distract in the least. Same goes for the horns. Brilliantly arranged and well placed. &quot;Northern Sky&quot;, as many have said, is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Overall this album is the one i gravitate to most. I do recommend EVERY one of his albums, FIVE LEAVES LEFT, PINK MOON, and TIME OF NO REPLY&gt; They are all great. Buy them, and your soul will thank you.
B00005U1YO|4.0|The Chemical Brothers conjure up another plate full of whipped, frenzied beats in &quot;Come with Us&quot;, the London duo's fourth studio outing since their groundbreaking &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot;.  Not necessarily Dance and not necessarily Rave or Electronica, &quot;Come With Us&quot; combines all elements of these genres to come up with some hyperkinetic action.  For those of you who enjoy the club scene, this CD does not disappoint.  My favorite tracks include &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;  and &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; -- both rock to killer grooves, earth shattering kick drums and layered sequences that melt beautifully into each other.  Most of &quot;Come with Us&quot; is like that, but the above two stand out for me.
0553573403|5.0|J.R.R Tolkein is a punk. Well, not really but in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; George R.R. Martin certainly raises the fantasy bar. Now my name isn't Mike R.R. Spivey, but I have read my fair share of sci-fi/fantasy books, and the Martin series is tops in the genre. Charismatic and nefarious personalities, swashbuckling and political intrigue, and oh yes your occasional fantastical beast all make for a sound read. Don't expect Martin to be pumping out sequels like Isaac Asimov or Tom Clancy, but thus far his books have been well worth the wait. A solid two ales raised into the air for &quot;A Game of Thrones!&quot;
B000005H3Y|5.0|and I don't say that lightly. Dexter Gordon was a true jazz giant and this album is his best, in my opinion and those of many others. Dexter's big, dark tone and deliberate yet tasty solos shine through on every cut, from the little-recorded songs &quot;Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry&quot; and &quot;Three O'Clock In The Morning&quot; to the more familiar &quot;Love For Sale&quot;. His supporting cast, Sonny Clark on piano, Billy Higgins on drums and Butch Warren on bass provide great collaboration.<br />This album is not secret; the cuts are well-represented on the various &quot;Best of&quot; cds out on Blue Note. Why get one or two cuts? Buy the whole thing on this CD!<br />I recommend this to all my jazz students and to anyone who likes mainstream jazz.
B000059XYM|3.0|I watched scary movie at the theatre and on video. The movie was funny and silly at the same time. Especially when the voluptious young Drew Decker tries to escape from the killer who is after her, and she stops in the middle of the yard all wet after running through a springler to show off her lovely body and caress her breasts while the killer is behind her. I found that particular scene funny because there were so many ways she could avoided her death and she chose to ignore them. The rest of the movie was somewhat funny and vulgar.
B00003CXMG|4.0|Almost Famous is a brilliant movie that tells the story of the rise (and implied fall) of the fictional 70s band Stillwater.  Crowe has said that Stillwater was inspired by the Eagles and he perfectly captures the heady 70s rock scene.  The cast is uniformly excellent, but Frances McDormand as the mother and Kate Hudson as Penny Lane are especially good.  The movie is sentimental whithout being too sticky and several scenes are instant classic.  In particular, I love the bus scene where the actors all sing Tiny Dancer.  Unfortunately, as good as this movie is, it lacks a director commentary from Cameron Crowe.  Worse yet, he subsequently released the \\"bootleg\\" version...that does include his commentary.  What a gyp!
B000002LCI|5.0|Forget about Violator, this is the record that stands above all others in the Depeche Mode catalogue. Easily the bands most intriguing, weird and wonderful record to date. No other album from the band sounds so unique so true to their own unforgettable style. From start to finish this album takes the listener on an unmissable journey starting with the the stadium shaking 'Never let me down again' to the emotional extremity of 'The things you said' and 'I want you now'. The thing that makes this album so appealing is that it showcases Depeche at their best. Social and sexual renegades who clearly do not fit into any sort of mainstream conformity. This record is not cliched at all and is possibly their most underground sounding record. Truly a modern masterpiece that surely must lay claim to be one of the finest electronic records yet recorded.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty has become an instant American classic movie, despite its detractors.  The acting is terrific and multi-layered, the editing is great, and it has some of the best lighting I've ever seen.  The movie chronicles the Suburban nightmare of Lester Burns, played by Kevin Spacey.  The characters are all miserable in their own way, but each learns lessons during the course of the movie that help ease their pain.<br />Fortunately, this DVD comes with a commentary track with director Sam Mendes (American Beauty was unbelievably his first movie!) and screenwriter Alan Ball (creator of the acclaimed series Six Feet Under).  Although their commentary is a bit self-congratulatory at times (the movie did win multiple Oscars after all), it is fascinating.  They take you through the entire movie-making experience and detail why certain choices were made.  I learned more about movie making from listening to their ocmmentary than from any book I've ever read.  Even if you didn't care much for the movie, I highly recommended the DVD.
B00005BL2A|3.0|On first listen Exciter comes across as a nice understated record that breezes along in a low key manner. Let's face it after four long years its nice to hear anything at all by a band that did so much to influence a generation, but then again maybe thats the problem. We've come to expect such high standards from Depeche that a record that isn't anything other than ground breaking isn't quite up to scratch. Exciter to me feels a little too sickly and sweet. Of course depeche have always penned a cracking ballad but this time the balladry feels a little sickly. Although I liked Exciter I wasn't inspired by it. As beautiful as songs like 'Goodnight Lovers' and 'when the body speaks' are, they can't help but make us think that Depeche have gone soft. The arena shaking numbers are few and far between which was a similar case on Ultra, however Ultra sounded lived in and dirty, all the things we love about the band. on the other hand Exciter feels a little feeble at times. Dream on is a real grower that is full of that dark depecheness that we love as are the dead of night and I feel loved, but one can't help but hope that the next Mode record will sound nothing like this one
B00000IBVC|3.0|I agree with other reviewers who praise the production values in this performance.  Zhang Yimou's stage direction is very impressive and reflects his wonderful visual sense.  Although at times he appears to have everyone under the sun on stage, the direction does not veer into the worst excesses of Zeffirelli.  Zhang makes some interesting decisions regarding how to stage the chorus-dominated scenes, and, by and large, they work quite well (especially the invocation to the moon).<br />The DVD direction, on the other hand, is another story.  The director keeps cutting to shots of the chorus, who are static because they are arranged like a choral society on the steps of the Forbidden Palace, while very interesting and/or beautiful things are happening on stage(such as the wonderful dance during the 1st scene's choral hymn to the executioner).  Another example of the director's strange choices is his insistence on showing the viewing audience the artificial moon during the moon invocation (oh, look, it's the moon!  and there's an axe superimposed!  how clever!) when Zhang had staged a beautiful and effective scene.<br />The performances were generally disappointing.  Larin's singing was adequate, no more, and his acting dismal.  Casolla sounded fine and she generated some heat during the riddle scene, but the final love duet was limp.  Frittoli was an effective Liu, but the PPP trio was made more annoying by using pointless affectations to create character (one was, apparently, suppposed to be drunk in the 1st scene.  Why?  who knows?).<br />I'd really give this performance 2 1/2 stars.
6301966015|5.0|Antonioni's international directorial debut is a gritty, sharp look at the attitudes and mores that prevailed in the London of the Sixties. It was the Swinging Capital of the world and Blow Up captures its essence for the following generations. If you want to know what was happening in the Swinging Sixties, 'Blow Up' makes you feel you were there. Following a trendy fashion photographer's work (based on David Hockney), we view fashions, political demonstrations, pot parties, etc. Blow Up is a masterpiece because unlike lesser works of art, its style can be idealised but not copied and reproduced irreverently. One of a kind.
006016848X|4.0|Okay, the book is repetitive and occasionally cloying (the 'love letters' are a little bit hilarious) but I have to say that when I look back at former relationships, there were arguments that could have been scripted from the pages of this book. Of course, it isn't going to apply to all individuals, nor do I think that it pretends to do so. I've found that by making some of the suggested adjustments, I really do get better results in dealing with men. Ultimately, that's the best testimonial that I can give.
B00005JKHP|5.0|The recent re-release of Star Trek - The Motion Picture on DVD was long, long overdue.  Now that Paramount has finally done so, all I can say is, it's about time! And shock of all shocks, they did it right too.<br />  There is no debating that the original film had some problems when it was released in 1979.  Director Robert Wise never had the chance to do the final edit he was promised due to release time constraints; some minor continuity errors existed; a script that &quot;borrowed&quot; a few elements from the series on which the film was based; and perhaps a story that wanted to be more than the final release reflected.  With the release on DVD, some of those problems have been rectified with the &quot;director's cut.&quot;<br />  I had been waiting for the release with bated breath, hoping that allowing Mr. Wise to work his magic on his original film would add much to a film that I have always thought was unfairly maligned by critics and fans alike.<br />  Robert Wise, to science fiction circles, holds legendary status, having directed two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made (The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Andromeda Strain).  Generally, I do not like seeing film makers tinker with their works-- George Lucas please take note, your special edition of the &quot;ST: A New Hope&quot; was, in my opinion, a politically corrected, botched up mess!  ST:TMP, for the most part, is a notable exception of where the film's reworking worked admirably to its advantage.<br />  I very much like the re-worked scenes on Vulcan.  Seeing the Vulcan landscape more accurately portrayed was a great touch.  Having corrected the Vulcan moon scene was quite welcome (for non-fans, it was established on the series that Vulcan has no moons).  Director Wise re-worked some pieces of dialogue into a much more pleasing order that added dimension to the film.  Some people have always pointed to the original film's running length, thinking it too long...  those folks might take note that this rendition is a few minutes longer, but those few minutes are well worth it!<br />  New special effects sequences have been added, and unlike other films, they do not draw attention to themselves.  Even with the change of technology since the late 1970's, the new effects fit in seamlessly.  AND surprisingly, they were not added gratuitously, but to complement the scenes in which they are inserted perfectly.  According to materials I have read these were the way the scenes were originally intended, but lack of time to properly edit them in necessitated their removal.  Yes, I am being somewhat vague here, as I would prefer the reader see the new film and judge for themselves, rather than me play the role of &quot;spoiler.&quot;<br />  All that said, I do have a few minor quibbles with the re-working.  Some new sound effects have been added as well, most of which add warmth to the film atmosphere, however, I question the removal of the ship's male computer voice and the new rendition of the Enterprise's general condition's alarm klaxon.<br />  In closing, I like the film very much.  Director Wise has done an admirable job in reworking his orignal film.  I enjoyed visiting old friends again.  I liked the uniforms, the sets, and the new characters (interestingly, Ilia and Decker clearly were the models for NEXT GEN's Riker and Troi).  I especially liked the interplay between all the old gang, who picked up nicely on their characters after a ten-year hiatus after NBC had foolishly cancelled the original series in 1969.  I liked the original release back in '79, but this new rendition adds much to a film that deserved much better than it got.  My recommendation is:  Buy, go rent it, judge for yourself!  This film's theme, demanding we seek a meaningful purpose for our lives plays far better than &quot;let's save the universe!&quot;  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised that this TREK film, more than any of the others, made a whole-hearted effort to be a cinematic experience, not just an expanded television episode.ence, not just an expanded television episode.
B000002KJQ|1.0|How in the hell could Warner Brothers allow the reMIXing of this masterpiece? Why didn't they just go ahead and re-record the whole damn thing while they were at it since they're obviously ashamed of it's AWESOME orginal sound. What made early ZZ Top so great was the tight, compact sound. Find an original copy of this album so you can be outraged at well. Technology was kind enough to give ZZ Top an extention on their career lifespan, but they really pushed it too far when they wanted all their drums to sound like a drum machine on their ENTIRE back catalog. Anyway, it's such a shame because I really wanted to hear this album on CD in it's orginal form and instead I got a doctored up, soul-lacking piece of dung. A big &quot;screw you&quot; to whoever remixed this. You are going to hell, good buddy.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I'm fairly picky, frankly, when it comes to music.  It's a rare album that doesn't get at least a track or two &quot;skipped&quot; whenever I'm listening to it...so I guess you can call this album very rare, indeed!<br />I don't watch videos or listen to pop music radio.  I'd heard mention of Pink from someone online, and I thought I'd check things out.  I'm absolutely ADDICTED!<br />Can't recommend it highly enough!
B000001Y5J|5.0|In my opinion this is the heaviest and angriest album by Nine Inch Nails ever!  But that can be a very good thing, and in this case it is.  Sounding extremely different from the technical music done by programming and keyboards on \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" \\"Broken\\" adds very loud and heavy guitars into the mix, which intensifies the music even more.  Trents voice is a lot more angrier and louder on this album than any other.<br />With only 8 songs, \\"Broken\\" proves to be one excellent album.  Every song is good, including the ones that dont have any singing in them.  My favorite songs on the album are \\"wish,\\" \\"help me, Im in hell,\\" \\"last,\\" and \\"gave up.\\"  Dont get me wrong, EVERY song on the album is good.  The only downside to the album is that there are only 8 songs and is only about 40 minutes long.  It wouldve been nice to have just a few more in there, but it's still a very good album with no other downfalls.<br />Bottom line: this is an awesome CD, and Trent Reznor proves once again that he has a unique talent when it comes to singing and writing.  Be prepared; this is unlike any other NIN album you have ever heard.  For those who arent familiar with NIN, it might be a little too heavy and hardcore.  As for the rest of you NIN freaks  I dont have to say any more, chances are that you already have the album and know exactly how much \\"Broken\\" [rocks].
0792839730|4.0|Considering the number of other reviews for this title, I will keep this brief. I'd recommend browsing other reviews too. <br />I saw the movie for the first time on this DVD. I originally got interested in this title because of Sean Connery. As I scanned the DVD case, I began noticing other names - Gene Hackman, Elliot Gould, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier (which was a shock), Robert Redford, and Maximilian Schell. At this point, I had to get it. <br />I loved this movie. Plain and simple. I also found the way certain people died to be interesting - even ironic at times. Some scenes showed how senseless some of the deaths were. <br />One actor bugged me - Ryan O'Neal. I don't like him in this movie. I don't care for his acting style. He doesn't come across as real. I kept wanting to compare him to Buster Crabbe who starred in the old Flash Gordon and Buck Rodgers serials. <br />The booklet inside the DVD case has some nice trivia information. <br />The subtitle selection bugged me on this DVD. I'm used to Japanese Anime DVDs where I can easily change the language and subtitles while the movie is playing. This is locked out on this DVD, forcing you to go to the menu to change the settings. ...at least on my player. I'm guessing this was to make things less confusing for the average user. For example, there are two different sets of English subtitles - one that only translates the German dialogue while the other provides subtitles for all dialogue. I sometimes watch DVDs late at night so I like using subtitles so I don't disturb others in the house. That's why I pay close attention to these type of features. Something about my setup seems to interfere with the closed captions. I just started noticing it with multiple DVDs so I don't know what might be up. I can't say it's a defect of the DVD right now.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Now I know what TRUE madness it. The theatre was empty during this whole movie from so many people walking out. I am appalled at the amount of people giving this good reviews. I guess everyone praises movies that drive them crazy so much to the point where they start to believe they like it!<br />I've never seen such a flawed movie in my life. What's all this<BR>about a standing ovation and clapping between numbers? Gimme a break. <br />2001 was the worst year ever for movies. The best one out of all<br />of them was &quot;Bandits.&quot;<br />I suggest this movie to people who also enjoy having teeth pulled out and walking on fire-hot coals. You'll have a blast with this one.
B00004YKUY|4.0|If you like classic Journey, you'll like this CD.  Some of the tracks seem to be trying a little too hard to be like the 'classic' Journey sound, but overall the musicianship and production quality of this CD is outstanding.  Livin' to Do is an amazing song, and Neal shows that he can still rip on the guitar - this guy deserves so much more credit as an outstanding guitarist than he gets.
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer seems to like albums that are short and sweet, and on their first album that formula paid off. I compare Cuomo's &quot;perfect&quot; song writing to classical composers like Schubert. That's where the comparison stops, however. A rockin' band, catchy vocals, and a dollop of humor make this one of my favorite CD's of all time. 10 years after it's release, it's still one of the few CD's I keep in the car at all times.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Loved it!  Although it was a very long movie &amp; I knew what was going to happen, I still stayed glued to my seat.
B000002UA0|5.0|The \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is a new style of mind expanding pychedelic art in the form of music. As written and played in 1967, Syd Barrett's contributions to the band are obvious. The vocalizing, profound psychedelic overdubs, intertwine with rock solid bass riffs and drum beats to produce a musical accomplishment of rare proportion. There's also a sense of humour permeating the work; the band doesn't sound as though they're taking themselves too seriously. The album is engineered to perfection: A thought provoking carousel of images emerges and amazes the gifted listener. Musical harmonies flow together into a stream of endless variations. A cosmic symphony unfolds a panorama of kaleidoscopic archetypes. Strong pulsing rhythms and synchronous lyrical ripplings, smooth out the trip within the center of your bubbling lava lamp. As the album ends its mesmeric 3-dimensional time warp, the final moments of \\"Bike,\\" (\\"you can ride it if you like\\"), drops one into a space of uncharted territory. Considering the album as a whole, reconfirms my belief in the power of music to communicate the deeper regions of reality.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtrack by Howard Shore and Enya is very beautiful, with soaring orchestrations, flute solos, uplifting choral vocals, and the enchanting influence of Enya.  A few songs are song in the languages invented by Tolkien.  Some tracks are named after chapters in the book and that way, the music fits both the book and the movie very well.  One thing I like about listening to the music is it allows me to recall parts of the movie that I really liked, such as &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, which begans with the music where Merry and Pippen meet Frodo and Sam, but then turns dark as it comes to the part where the dark rider came.  There are also tracks that recall dramatic, action points in the movie, such as &quot;Treason of Isengard&quot;, &quot;A Knife In the Dark&quot;, an d&quot;Bridge Of Khazad Dum&quot;.  Sometimes a track has a style distinguished from the other tracks, such as &quot;Concerning Hobbitts&quot;, which has a baroque/traditional style.  &quot;Lothlorien&quot; is very lovely and ethereal sounding(years ago Enya composed her own version of &quot;Lothlorien&quot; on her album &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;).  We all know of Enya's theme, &quot;May It Be&quot;, which is without a doubt one of her best songs.  Another of her songs less commonly talked about is &quot;Aniron&quot;, which is all sung in one of Tolkien's languages.  It recalls the part of the movie when Arwen and Aragorn have their own private meeting.  There is a another theme to the soundtrack, too.  &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; track recalls the last scenes at the end of the movie with flute and drums and then has a theme called, &quot;In Dreams&quot;, which was composed by Howard Shore and performed by falsetto Edward Ross.  It is a very lovely theme with pretty lyrics and music.  I don't see how one can not like the Enya songs.  It's too bad that she didn't win the Golden Globe Award, but I do hope she wins the Oscar, which she does deserve.  All in all, this is a very wonderful soundtrack, magical music that goes along with a magical movie based on a very magical books.  This is one of my favorite soundtracks and one of the best of the year, along with the Harry Potter soundtrack.  I highly recommend it, so get it!
B00004VXF2|1.0|My uncle Curtis and me and my sister Caitlyn when we were little kids used to ride around in his trans am listening to Lou Reids gratest hits on cassette- remember those. I think walk on the wild side is nice song and I thought with Lou looking all like a real punk rocker and this being a two album set and all that it would rock our britches off. But what is this? Its got no songs on it, I mean he must of just went in the recording studio drunk and angry and mashed the record button with both fists and just took his guitar and slammed it in the wall for an hour. And then he made a record of it? What gives? My sister though we were crazy but we put it on at home and even the cat was about to puke his fury guts out. He should of just made it one cd or at least charged you the price of one. Its not like it took any great effort to make this album. Actuayll it must have drove him crazy to have to sit there for an hour throwing his guitar all over the wall. I bet you he took for tylinal that night. So what you get here is not what you would expect from the dude who gave us take a walk on the wild the side. He must of been abusing his prescriptions to come up with this mess. So maybe it just a good lesson to not do drugs- something we need in the world. It really sad that people go down this path in life.
0385484518|5.0|The book tuesday with morrie is an great book. It has some much details as you read it. As well as great advice and insperation. Morrie, a great professor and a wonderful man that learns about his illness and has to learn how to live and cope with this, knowing that, that day will be here alot sooner then anybody knows. Mitch Albon one of his past student that was devoted to his teacher's great teaching, meet up and discuss great life knowledging stories of the past, present, and future. <BR> Such a heart warming story You don,t want to miss out.
B00005ARDC|5.0|...that cures your head of the cliche tuneage so rampant out there. This was definitely My Best Album Purchase of 2001. These guys hit every one of my musical happy-strings. It's true, their influences are boldly portrayed in nearly every track (e.g., The Verve, Jesus & Mary Chain, Love and Rockets [DEFINITELY], Stone Roses, and even some late 60's acid-Beatles), but being that THOSE groups have made the albums I never tire of listening to, I find BMRC's first offering to be total ear candy, and very much their own. I find I like fewer and fewer new bands, but the BRMC sound has made my toes curl in a way they have not curled since first hearing The Verve in 1994. Fabulous background music, party music, thinking music & working music. This is the real deal--focused, heavy, don't-rush-it, bass-ey, punk-funk-rock. Sample it and see.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a love it or hate it extravaganza.  You have to see it and then decide for yourself.  I loved the stunning visuals and absurdness of the whole thing.  Afterwards, I was left with lots of funny images, including turn-of-the-century Parisians in tuxedos singing Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.  Hilarious.
B000002OHX|5.0|Simply outstanding.  This album has been in my top 5 favorite albums since it came out in 1974. I have every note of every song memorized.  The new CD edition includes a bonus cut of Phoenix which was not included in the vinyl version.  It's interesting to see the difference between the two versions.  <BR>This album is highly recommended.  Listen to it with headphones on for the full effect of the twin lead guitars (Andy Powell on 1 channel and Ted Turner on the other).
0306801515|5.0|While deciding on my major in college I read this book.  It provides a good overview of Structures in terms anyone can understand.  In fact, its interesting enough (most of the time) to read even if you're not interested in engineering but want to learn, well, why things don't fall down.
B000002H6C|5.0|Yes,that's right.I think this album is better than Master of Puppets.I know that I'm among a very few.Most of all the Met fans would differ.This album just has  better songs,and is by far the best pre-Load album.With the wonderful \\"One\\".About a tormented soldier that was blown apart by a land mine,and wishes to God to set him free(Wishes for death).Among Metallica's best songs no doubt.But thats not it.Also songs like \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\".It's about a man that go's mad and go's on a killing spree.\\"eye of the Beholder\\" is another good one on here.It talks about how government trys to cencer everything,and determins how we should live.Finally \\"the Frayed Ends of Sanity\\".About a man thats ,well,crazy.This album is hard and fast.\\"One\\" is the only soft song on here.But it is not as fast as Met's earlier works.So if your going to buy it expecting the modern Metallica.You'll be dissoppointed.So to will you be if you expect the Kill,Lightning,Puppets Metallica.This album was during the old/new Metallica transition.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I am amazed by the carping critics who deride the skill of Howard, Crowe,Connelly, et al, in conveying a powerful, moving story of the redemptive power of human love and the strength of human character to overcome one's own demons,real or imagined. To have slavishly followed Nash's biography would have detracted and distracted from the focus and eloquence of this film. Watching these talented actors perform with a wonderful script under the skillful direction of Ron Howard is a rare treat. Crowe's performances through Insider, Gladiator and now Beautiful Mind confirm that he is a true acting genius. This film will be recognized over time as a masterpiece and will never become dated or maudlin.The viewers should immerse themselves in the beauty and stength of this film,and the important issues presented, and not worry if every character flaw or problem in Nash's life is explored. For that, the book serves the purpose. Meanwhile, we should  appreciate this gem.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Why should you buy this cd? only 'cause it features the best rock drumming EVER by the greatest rock drummer EVER! nothing as good came before, and nothing better will ever be. period. god bless keith moon
0060977493|5.0|Before saying anything about this book - my literary tastes. I like simple books - feel-good books with a quick-moving plot, linear narrative, simple prose and above all, an authorial voice that stays in the background. <br />Why then do I love this book? <br />It is the living embodiment of everything I dislike in a novel - the authorial voice is so loud you couldn't miss it if you were deaf; the narrative is anything but linear and the prose is everything but simple; the symbolism is everything but subtle; the pace is everything but fast. There are no simple solutions, no happy resolutions - this is the sort of book that makes you wish you had never lived. <br />The story is enormously complex - a lesser writer would have cracked under the burden of the plot, but not this one. The story traces the history of the Indian state of Kerala. I have no idea how accurately she has portrayed its history - but it must be said that every page of the book bears that 'stamp of authenticity' so essential for a book of this kind. <br />The greatest triumph of this book - apart from the brilliant characterization and the hugely complex and demanding plot - is the language. I am not talking about the 'poetic prose' that covers the pages of this book - I refer to the convincing manner in which she conveys the flavour of 'Indian English.' Few writers manage to describe how Indians really talk without descending to the exotic or worse, the ludicruous - a few manage to pull it off. R. K Narayan was one. Arundhati Roy is another. <br />Instances of 'Indian English' abound.<br />There is Rahel telling her twin brother that 'sorry doesn't make a dead man alive' - I am not entirely sure she did not eavesdrop on my private conversations. Then there is Estha saying 'Thang God' on finding out that the elephant that has died isn't an elephant they know, and Baby Kochchamma's subsequent correction - all priceless, and wickedly accurate.<br />Then there is the plot - conceived on an epic scale- at first, it seems to want to say everything without actually saying anything. Then the pages on the right grow thin and you find that everything makes sense - the whole, complex, convoluted story, every 'Small Thing' now finds a place in the scheme of things.<br />Each character is perfectly drawn out - fully three-dimensional. You have the Oxford-educated Chacko, the ornamental-gardening-graduate-cable-TV-addict-untouchable-hating ...-Father-Mulligan-loving Baby Kochamma (in my opinion the book's most convincing character), Papachi - the anglophile and the violin playing Mamachi - all perfect. And what is one to say of the portrayal of the twins. I am yet to find a book that can write of children's feelings more convincingly. 'Convincing' is the keyword here. <br />That there will be those who may dislike her political views, there is no doubt (I have an exceedingly low opinion of her political essays), but the manner in which she delivers a resoundingly powerful, deeply moving tale - what can I say - whoever coined the word 'masterpiece' must have had had this book in mind.
B00005RFVL|5.0|Is this CD released in US yet? I bought it in Canada. There is a strange thing on the track #15 &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;. Both my PC and stereo say the track is 28 minutes long. The song itself is only about 4 minutes, so the rest is dead silence. Is this by design?<br />Otherwise, this CD is great.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Wow. This movie totally blew me away. My family bought it a few days after it came out on DVD; I hadn't seen it in the theater, and lots of people that I knew said it was a good movie. Just watching the street racing gave me an adrenaline rush, not to mention Paul Walker's gorgeous aquamarine blue eyes...WOW. But, that's besides the point. This movie had a really good plot/story line, and subtle sub plots. So, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves cars, girls, guys, whatever! It's all in here!
B00003CXE7|4.0|What fascinates me about this film was the heavy use of computer graphics in the making of the film, including the stunning remaking of the Colosseum.  Believe me, &lt;Titanic&gt; has met its match.<br />Unlike &lt;Titanic&gt; however, this film is actually blessed with good performance, a decent script, and a fair amount of historical research.  In fact, the second DVD is mainly a documentary about the role of gladitorial combat in Roman society in those days, which I heartily to classical history teachers.
0783226837|5.0|That is the general premise of this movie. Creatures that can hear your movements underground. That is all that I can really say without truly spoiling the movie.<br />This movie is definitely a hilarious uproar that even the whole family could see. It isn't that graphic at all.  The first time hat I saw this movie I was about 11, maybe 12 and my whole family laughed ourselves silly to this movie. The movie is filled with good dialogue and oddly enough and decent plot, all things considered. Fairly original.<br />Overall a good buy, definitely get this movie.
B00000JZC4|5.0|Dammit, this is the second review I have written for this CD, and I am going to have to get angry.  I am sick of almost everybody saying something about how this sounds like NIN.  Hey people... if you knew anything about Filter, you would know that Richard Patrick (lead singer, guitarist) left his post as the lead guitarist for Nine Inch Nails in 1995 to form his own band. So, maybe he does sound a bit like him (need I remind you that when the songs are made, NIN is Trent and Trent alone, only when he goes on tour does he get his backup band together), but what do you expect?  When Ozzy left Black Sabbath, what did he sound like??  When Rob Zombie broke up White Zombie, what did he sound like??  When Jerry Cantrell (Alice in Chains) made a solo record, what did he sound like?  Now you see?  Stop comparing this to NIN and take it for what it is... A hell of a good album.  Yes, &quot;Take a Picture&quot; is kinda weak and overplayed, but the rest of the album is amazing.  I won't go into too much detail, but all I can say is: buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
0790729733|5.0|JFK, what can you say about it to do it justice? Its a work of art? Its the most controversal film in history? A true masterpiece? Nothing in words can describe this epic. From the director who has brought you some of the best (Platoon, Born on the 4th of July, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, U-Turn, The Doors, Wall Street, Heaven &amp; Earth &amp; Talk Radio) brings another mystery to life, the JFK Assasignation. The acting is some of the best in history. Shame the Academy didnt think so. This film has everything you go to the movies for, and everything you thought no one would ever talk about. Go see this movie, if you ever see one more movie in your life, its gotta be JFK!
B0000024LN|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.But it just is a classic album. I bought this back in 1996.I was gonna buy Mobb Deep's Hell on Earth over this album,so i bought both LP's. I'm glad because this is a classic. Best Redman i think. Every song on this joint is bangin. Its pretty much the same ol same ol Redman lyric-wise but the beats are raw hardcore. Even the Intro is tight bagga goom baggaye, which leads into the hardcore &quot;Iz he 4 Real&quot; with Rock of Heltah Skeltah's voice as the hook. Shiit is tight. Redman is the best emcee. And til this day(2002), I still have this CD in my car. And basically bump it every week. You gotta cop this. Redman remains unchanged unlike many rappers now, to serve the radio/video rap listeners, in his own words &quot;hard, far from commercial&quot;. His beats are now a little crossover but his lyrics are still underground thirsty. If you dont already have this than, Pick it up Pick it up cuz It's like that. Peace
B00000IMTF|4.0|This is a masterpiece of hard rock! The spectrum of music, lyrics, and style is amazing. One of my favorite Rainbow tracks is here, &quot;Stargazer&quot;. Blackmore, Dio, and Carey shine, but I can't leave out Powell and Bain. All of the Rainbow albums have proved what a talented line up can do! This is a pleasure to listen to from begining to end. Other favorites here are &quot;Starstruck&quot;, &quot;Run With the Wolf&quot;, and &quot;Do You Close Your Eyes&quot;. Very strong album indeed, but I would still point you towards LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL as the best to buy other than their best of disc.
B00005UEAR|5.0|If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed.  Just buy it.  One of the few bands that I'll buy a new CD without hearing any of it first.  This CD is loaded!

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee wrote there a delicate and sensitive novel on the coming of age of two children in the South (Alabama) in the mid 1930s, that is to say during the Great Depression. The central issue of the book is the progressive discovery of the outside world by two - or three - young children, a girl and one or two boys. This discovery has to do with the ugliness of some people in our society, the prejudiced white people, the openly lazy white social cases who live on welfare, the miscarriage of justice against a black man who is condemned on the sole testimony of two white people by an all white male jury, the planned and failed lynching of the black man the day before his trial, etc. But it is also the discovery of the neighbors and that the people you see, or don't see, everyday are not necessarily what they seem to be, like this crippled woman who is fighting successfully her morphine addiction and conquers it just before dying, so that she can die clean. But it all centers on one neighbor that leads the life of a recluse and that fascinates the children who want to attract him outside to see him. They will eventually succeed twice, the first time totally unawares of it, and the second time just in time for him to save the life of the two children in the hands and under the knife of a white reject of society. This initiation to society goes along with the desire to make these children fit for southern gentility, for them to be a gentlemen and a lady, even if those ladies and gentlemen are not exactly pure and clean, unprejudiced and open-minded, in fact quite the reverse. But it is by integrating this society that you may make it change little by little because most of them want change but do not have the courage to advocate it, though they will support those who willl stand for a reasonable and progressive change. The book is so touching and full of feeling, that it probably is the masterpiece of a life time, and a time-enduring one.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
0446677450|5.0|My father, Richard, was a very good father and I thought this book rather scandalous to imply that he was anything but a superb dad. Unfortunately I did not understand the context of the book as I thought that it was written under a psuedoname by my sister who always blamed my father, Rich, for her lack of success.<br />Never-the-less I did find some of the important things that my father taught me about money missing :<BR>1 Certain foreign coins can be used in call boxes to do long distance calls<br />2 If you fold some bills in a particular fashion then Andrew Jackson looks like he has a bee hive on his head; and<BR>3 Money can't buy you love but it does afford an hour of something that comes close but with out any settlement activities.<br />Shelf advice:<BR>(Where to store this book for best and worst effect)<BR>This book should be stored at home once read unless you live in a pretty impoverised home where people might think \\"Huh! That worked for you!\\". If so, store it in the toilet so that people regard it as a sort of 'work in progress'. Do not take it on dates with you to impress the opposite sex. The book is not heavy enough for an end of shelf role and is probably best stored flat.
0226264017|3.0|This is a pretty interesting book, if for no other reason than that it lays out one person's conservative economic views.  Some may be ideas you haven't thought of before, and that, in itself, is valuable.  This isn't the Bible of economics, though.  Among the greatest faults of this book is that it doesn't really seriously address any views that compete with Friedman's ideas.  (You'll notice a lot of the positive reviews here are from people who agreed with Friedman to begin with.  A book that promotes one viewpoint without really answering its critics is perfect for preaching to the choir.)  Friedman tends to set up problems in ways that aid his arguments, appeal to moral principles that are by no means universally shared, argue from analogies that don't quite fit, and (worst of all) water down opposing arguments or simply neglect to mention them.  If you don't believe strongly that \\"Freedom is the ultimate value\\" (not basic survival? love? aesthetics? even material gain?) and that the Government is the only real limit on individual freedom (corporations? powerful individuals? lack of basic food and shelter?), prepare to be underwhelmed by Friedman's conservative tract.  Read it though, if for no reason other than to understand what shaky arguments your libertarian friends base their views on.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|There is really no reason to purchase this CD other than the fantastic Beck cover of David Bowie's Diamond Dogs.  Otherwise, look elsewhere... listening to Nicole Kidman sing is like dragging your finger nails across a blackboard.<br />Cheerio... it's your money!
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is one of those movies that people either really like, or really dislike.  I'm one of the former.  Bill Murray is hilarious, and easy for work-stressed boomers to identify with.  This movie made me fall in love with Andie McDowell -- unfortunately she just got hitched.  If you like Bill Murray, you should also check out Rushmore.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a little bit of everything that one could hope for in a movie. It's touching, sweet,romantic and breathtaking. It's one of the best tales of forbiden love that I have ever viewed. The movie stars Niclole Kidman as Satine, the young and beautiful lead showgirl at the Moulin Rouge, who wants more that anything to be a really actress. And, Ewan McGregor, who plays Christian, a very optamistic writer who came to Paris looking for love. The chemistary between Nicloe and Ewan is perfect, and so is the mix of music from &quot;The sound of Music&quot; to &quot;I will Always Love You.&quot; There voices are so wonderful to hear, that it makes you sit down close your eyes an just listen. The special effects in the movie are just so crazy that it becomes magical. Moulin Rouge will make you believe that the most important thing of all is to love and be loved in return.
0375507507|1.0|I would agree with one other reviewer that the writing in Alexandra Fuller's book is unfortunately not the best. At one point she tries to make a comparison between Zimbabwe and a teapot and it makes no sense. There are many more of these, enough, to kind of put you off and it's a shame. Some people might like the fact that the author's family is so very eccentric and so refreshingly upfront in their white supremacist sense of priviledge. In this sense Fuller spins a yarn that some might find new to them and entertaining. In the end it was a dud for me because it was just that-- entertainment and really not about much else. I like jungle Safaris too and I like to take in carnival scenes; I also like books to have some transcendental point and to be about something other than itself. Perhaps it would be more worthwhile to in fact visit Southern African writers such as Zimbabwean, Tsitsi Dangeremba whose &quot;Nervous Conditions&quot; made a deep imact on me. So all in all &quot;Don't Let's...&quot; is interesting in its quest to delight you with a strange tale about dysfunctionals but a perspective, whatever that perspective may be, would have helped tremendously.

B00004TH83|5.0|I stumbled across this album...then purchased...about a year ago and have been listening to it ever since.  Lara Fabian's slightly throaty voice and equisite styling remind me of Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion. Like them, she puts a great deal of feeling into her vocals.  Her songs are about the bitersweet memories of past relationships that she can't quite forget and still longs for. The orchestral accompaniments are very effective as well. I was completely captivated by this album.
6305499365|5.0|If any movie best replicates the obsurdity of the white collar/cube life, it is this movie.<br />Mike Judge has pegged the 90's corporate mentality and made it into one of the funniest and least respected movies of the late 90's.<br />Ron Livingston does a great job with a role that could have been totally ruined with the wrong actor and Jennifer Aniston steps back and let someone else take the limelight, for once.<br />The soundtrack for this movie adds another layer to the hilarity, with its gangster rap background to the vanilla white/nerdy office goofs.<br />This movie will especially delight those that work in the I.T. or I.S. departments.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I think that Moulin Rouge is the best movie EVER. And I mean ever. While it may not exactly be appropriate for those under 13, I still think there is no way a movie could be better. Even if you don't like musicals, I still think you would like the movie. You don't have to buy it, just rent it. Listen to samples of the soundtrack! Just be a part of this fantastic phenomenon. Really. And I am not just some freak, either. A lot of people hold my opinions in high regard. Really! Please. Please watch this movie and have a SPECTACULAR SPECTACULAR (you'll get it after you watch the movie) time!!!!!!!
0871137380|5.0|I am a non-military person that enjoys that action/adventure military sagas.  Too many times however, these books deal with heroes where there is clear good and clear evil.  Right should always overcome wrong, etc...<br />In this book, you are involved in a story (based on actual recent events in Somalia) where true American heroes were placed in a situation where they were not given all the tools necessary to win (i.e., tanks, full military support from Clinton, etc.) -- and yet in the end, triumphed in a manner better than I would have thought possible.  The book was overwhelming in the rollercoaster emotions of the life and death struggle of these brave men.<br />The book does a great job of developing enough history and information about the individual characters -- without dragging in to much detail. The story becomes riveting as groups of soldiers are pinned down and huge mobs of angry Somalians are closing in.  <br />I really couldn't put it down.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|the creators of this movie obviously have some talent.. and lots of money.. every aspect of this movie is completley annoying, the characters, set, music, editing, ect ect.. a thoroughly terrible experience..
0375507507|4.0|Not at all what I expected. I thought this book would be an apologetic narrative. Instead, it read more like a young girl's journal, focusing on her family's poverty, the natural dangers of farm living in South Africa, war, government corruption, alcoholism, loss, and animals. The author does not shy away from reflecting on attitudes and prejudices, and does not get caught up trying to rationalize apartheid. It was a very good read, and some parts were almost poetic in descriptiveness. Beautifully told, but the ending sort of dozed off.

0060392886|5.0|From the opening chapter of \\"The Dirt\\" detailing our heroes escpades in what they had dubbed \\"The Motley House\\" - a pigsty apartment they'd party with the likes of David Lee Roth, Ratt, and hordes of lustful groupies in, the reader is swept up in a tale of sex, drugs, misadventures, tragedys, and mayhem that takes off at Warp 10 and never slows down.  <br />While often times hilarious, some of what is chronicled in here will give the reader pause as to just how in the world the boys in the Crue have managed to live this long.  Between Vince's love for all things female (not to mention alcohol and various other party favors), Nikki's vagabond childhood followed by a self-destructive adulthood, Mick's life of quiet desperation - and admission to a rare degenerative disease that's slowly killing him, and Tommy Lee as the hopeless romantic who let himself get led all to easily into bad situations time and time again, \\"The Dirt\\" will leave the reader at times disgusted as to how 4 such talented individuals could have thrown away so much the world has given them, shocked at their utter disregard for their own well-being as well as those around them, but also at times holding back tears upon learning the intimate details of such events as Skylar's (Vince's 4 year old daughter) losing battle with cancer, Nikki's family history, and Tommy's incarceration.<br />Through these 400+ pages the boys manage to implicate at least 2 dozen other equally famous people (the most entertaining chapter being with Ozzy Osbourne on their \\"Shout at the Devil\\" tour), in all sorts of mischeiveous and illegal activities without ever once making themselves seem above any of it.  True to themselves and to their fans, this is a must read for anyone who ever loved the Crue.
0316776963|3.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is a quick and easy read that is best taken in small bites.  Sedaris' style lends itself to quick reading, but that doesn't mean you should necessarily read the entire book in one sitting.   The best short bites the book has to offer are the first essay about Sedaris' speech impediment and the essays in the back which deal with his adjustment to France and his attempt to learn French.  Feel free to skip the essays about his brief life as an artist and as a teacher.  They are both unsettling in that they make one pity the author, and they are not as entertaining as they could be.

B00005RHGK|2.0|I just saw Jeepers Creepers for the first time and what started out as a pretty suspense filled road movie ended up as typical schlock. I liked how this movie started with a brother and sister riding home and wind up being terrorized by a nut in a truck. This movie really had my attention through the first 45 minutes or so.The best scenes involved the discovery in the drainpipe and the scene with the police car. But once the movie came to the police station, it started irritating me. For one thing, I could not stand the pyschic woman actually announcing when the scare scenes would actually happen. Then there is the issue involving that ridiculous song. How cliche is that now? But what ticked me off was the movie's ending.(Or non-ending as it were). Obviously, it was to set up the inevitable sequel. It got off to a good start, but Jeepers Creepers ultimatly crashes into a wall of cliches.
6301966015|2.0|Blow-Up (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1966)<br /><br />Antonioni's film career, these days, is little more than a footnote in the textbooks of aspiring filmmakers and  critics. Most of his movies have already been forgotten less than a half-century after they were made. One of the exceptions is Blow-Up, which was nominated for almost as many awards  as O. J. Simpson. Watching it thirty-five years after its release, one wonders why.<br /><br />Much of the film's power probably had to do with its cultural context. Blow-Up, which is ostensibly about a  photographer (a very young David Hemming, later to not achieve the great fame he should have for his role in Profondo Rosso, one of the finest films ever made) who may or may not  have captured a murder on film without meaning to, was actually full of subtext about the meaning of photography in the modern world. When you realize the infamous Zapruder film was released at around the same time and<br />viewable by those in the know, the questions get a lot more compelling. At least they did to those who theorized  endlessly about a grassy knoll in Dallas in 1963. Removed from that context now, Antonioni's crowning achievement looks a bit more like Thomas' Harris novel The Silence of  the Lambs. As the book, which is mediocre at best, was carried to stardom within the context of Jonathan Demme's excellent film, Blow-Up took its cue from Zapruder.  However, while Harris' next novel showed the rest of the world that Harris was, in fact, not a writer up to par with Demme's filmmaking, Antonioni's followup (the gloriously  vapid, now largely-forgotten Zabriskie Point, a film of interest only to hardcore Pink Floyd fans-and even most of THEM find it insufferable) had no effect on the filmmaker's stature  whatsoever. Even time seems to have left Antonioni relatively unscathed, and many still see Blow-Up as a classic. I will continue to wonder what they're thinking. Both Hemming  and co-star Vanessa Redgrave seem somewhat lost in their parts, various gratuitous nude scenes are thrown in for what seems to be shock value more than anything, the  Yardbirds make a pointless cameo, and what is actually on the roll of film that everyone's so concerned about never captures the viewer's attention nearly as much as it captures  the attentions of everyone else. Sometimes this technique works. Here, it doesn't. * ½arts, various gratuitous nude scenes are thrown in for what seems to be shock value more than anything, the  Yardbirds make a pointless cameo, and what is actually on the roll of film that everyone's so concerned about never captures the viewer's attention nearly as much as it captures  the attentions of everyone else.

B00003Q43A|2.0|this is an ok movie, the FX are great, but the characters are thin as paper. And there were some parts that really didn't add anything to the plot. For example, the presidents wife dying. And does anyone out there honestly believe that someone wouldn't prevent the president from risking his life? its just not realistic. but then again, the entire plot isn't realistic come to think of it. A piece of fluff, but an entertaining piece of fluff I suppose. The acting isn't that great either. The acting on the part of everyone is overdone.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Well... what to say? This CD was an interesting experience for me.  It certainly is not \\"Make Yourself,\\" that's for sure.  I think the lyrics are weaker... the guitar riffs kick much butt, but they don't affect me the way they did on \\"Make Yourself.\\" There are some things that bother the *hell* out of me on this CD that I can't really get over.  <br />   Number one, \\"I Wish You Were Here\\" catchy, nice... repetitive.  Extremely repetitive. Bad, bad lyrics.  I don't care if there needs to be a poppy, radio-y song on this, that is no excuse for bad songwriting... all it does is bring down the band.  \\"Make Yourself\\" had \\"Pardon Me\\" and \\"Drive\\"... both singles, both very catchy and very driving, deep and meaningful.  \\"I Wish You Were Here\\" is crap.  It's pretty crap, but still crap.<br />   Number Two, \\"Aqueous Transmission,\\" more mindlessness... props to the boys for using a neat new instrument and putting it to good use.  I don't understand what all the fuss is over it though... it isn't anything special at all.  They could have made an almost exact same sound with a normal guitar and then the only gimmick in the song is gone... and that's really all that the song is; a gimmick.<br />   Number Three, weak music in general.  I'm sorry, but Incubus used to stimulate my mind in amazing ways... very much made me the person I am today.  This stuff on \\"Morning View\\" is... nice.  That's the problem.  It's all very nice and pretty and sedated.  True, there are two or three songs really start to do it... but then they end and there is nothing left but decadent prettiness.<br />   There were times listening to this CD that I wanted to yell at Incubus: \\"Where is your spirit?!\\" \\"Why aren't you breaking loose?? I mean, *truly* breaking loose?!?\\" \\"Who has sedated you so, my beautiful Incubus, and where can I find them?\\"<br />   Of course, all that is now.  I admit that when I first bought the CD that I could not get enough of the neat, tantric, enya-like, effect... but I'm tired ofthat now.  I was tired of that a week later.  I'm ready for the rest of the songs on the CD... the really good ones.  Where are they?<br />   Although I still rather like the CD - Brandon sounds beautiful, as usual, and the guitars and scratching complement the music very well to make very smooth, well-built songs - it lacks spirit.  Not the entire CD mind you, but just enough songs lack to make it seem so.  <br />   \\"Morning View\\" gathers dust on my CD pile... Lateralus (Tool) and Make Yourself I carry with me wherever I go.
B00005UEAR|5.0|If you think that there is no worthy music out there, you need only turn to Dream Theater.  Their latest \\"Six Degree of Inner Turbulence\\" is a classic.  I was literaly shivering when I heard \\"Disapear\\".  And the ending part of \\"Misunderstood\\" WOW!!.  Only DT can write a 13 min song about stem cell research(The Great Debate) and keep your interest throughout.  I have everything from this band and I consider the them the best in the business.  I am not going to say this is their best, because when you talk about DT, anything they put out is the best.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the first tool album I have ever bought.  That being said, I can't say that I enjoyed Aenima or Untertow nearly as much... honestly, Undertow sits on top of my stack of CD's gathering dust, while I carry around Lateralus and Aenima in my little carrying case all day long.  <BR>   Even then, Lateralus is the only one I can actually sit down and listen to for an extended period of time... hours and hours in fact.  Aenima stays with me because of four or five of the songs, Lateralus is conpletely irresistable to me.  This CD makes a star rating completely irrelevent, and utterly useless.<BR>   Lateralus can be described as an epic journey, although saying so would do the CD absolutely no justice.  Tool has succeeded in creating a peice of music that defies words... there are characters, stories and ideas placed throughout this CD and it seems to tell of a journey through an alternate reality that somehow directly relates to our own... it amazes and shocks and bewilders all the senses.<BR>   As someone who follows the teachings of the Buddha I also found the lyrics extremely insightful and enlightened... these are real, intelligent, people creating something thatmay change the world.<BR>   But even if it doesn't, then at least I'll finally be able to fight off the giant bright pink suffocating pillows of shallow, materialistic pop culture and find music that truly enlightens.

B00005JKQX|5.0|In \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" we see not only the beauty of John Nash's genius, but the beauty of his portrayal by a truly intelligent actor.  The more I think about this film the more I admire it. I think it needs to be seen more than once to fully appreciate it.  <br />I am a relatively recent admirer of Russell Crowe, but I don't think there is any other actor with the range and ability he has to offer. The movie also inspired me to read Sylia Nasar's book, and to view as many other Russell Crowe movies as I could find.  This actor has a real gift for coming across honestly in whatever part he plays.        <br />John Nash is a rather frenetic character.  He is a little bit like the absent-minded professor completely absorbed in his own world, who is excited by the ideas presented to him by the workings of his mind.  Not a social person, and at the onset of his illness, his mind creates illusions that are consistent with his real life in many respects.  We, the audience can find believability in the events we are shown because of who and where Nash is.  Ron Howard does a great job of melding the real with the illusion.  Crowe shows Nash's lack of comfort with other people and the fear and confusion that his illusions create-and that made me feel uncomfortable watching him at times.  But I think he was right on. Scenes at the height of Nash's illness allow for an appreciation of how much control he gains over his life later.<br />Jennifer Connelly's performance is outstanding in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" as well.  She's the one who gives Nash something to hang onto.  Connelly portrays an intelligent, caring woman, and is very believable. I see Ed Harris's character as an admirer of Nash who becomes a nightmare, and as Nash's illness comes under control, so does the nightmare - played very deftly by Harris.   <br />This is a very complex, heart-warming film and can't be taken as a medical expose. Its the best film I've seen in awhile.  And if nothing else, I think you would go away with an appreciation of its lead actor.

B00005U8EM|5.0|Okay, I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me past the opening line of this review : Groundhog Day is perhaps the most underappreciated<br />movie of the 90s and one of the best comedies since Hollywood's Golden Age, a film Frank Capra would have been proud of making.  Did I<br />lose you?  Rolling on the ground laughing?  Does the very concept of Bill Murray and Harold Ramis making one of the great films of all time<br />strike you as too absurd for words?  Well, hold on, and try this : forget everything you know about the movie and just listen to a brief<br />description :<br />A monstrously self-centered TV personality is sent to small town America to cover a hokey holiday.  He's accompanied by a<br />too-innocent-to-be-believed, but button-cute, producer and a smart-alecky camera man.  Trapped by a snow storm, which he had erroneously<br />predicted would miss the region, our egomaniac is forced to spend the night in town and, when he awakes, finds to his horror that he's reliving<br />the same day over again. And reliving, and reliving, and reliving....  At first, he takes some enjoyment in the seeming prescience this provides<br />him and he takes great liberties once he realizes that he will never have to face the consequences for any action he takes, because tomorrow<br />never comes.  Though his producer is quite obviously repelled by his self-centered nature, he eventually discovers that he can worm his way<br />into her affections by dating her over and over again and discovering her likes and dislikes, since she, of course, remembers nothing of the<br />prior dates.  Yet, even with all this effort, he is unable to win her, because he remains, fundamentally, obnoxious.  Forced to confront his own<br />unpleasantness and unlovability and the essential emptiness of his life, the man, aware now that he hates himself, tries to commit suicide, in<br />various and sundry ways, but always awakens to greet the dawning of the new/old day.  And so now, at last, his efforts turn to<br />self-improvement, rather than to self-aggrandizement, and to helping others rather than to satisfying his own urges.  His dilemma forces him to<br />move beyond himself and to serve others.  Where he once avoided the people of the town like the plague, he is now become an integral part of<br />their community, and where he once saw the producer as merely an object of his lust, he now proves himself worthy of her love.  The next<br />morning, time resumes its regular progression and he resumes his life, a better man.  Honestly, doesn't that sound like a Capra flick, starring<br />Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur?<br />In fact, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis have made enough dogs, separately and together, to warrant your healthy skepticism, but Murray's<br />performance here is generally under control and Ramis seldom stoops to gags and pratfalls.  There's a big upside to the nasty edge that Murray<br />always carries with him; we're prone to forgetting just how dark Jimmy Stewart's screen persona often tended to be, from explosive and<br />suicidal, like George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life, to voyeuristic and manipulative, in Rear Window, to domineering and obsessive, in<br />Vertigo. Andie MacDowell, on the other hand, is a tad too vacuous to counterbalance Murray effectively, but that's a tolerable flaw since it's<br />very much Murray's movie.<br />Still not convinced?  Here's my last try : how many recent films, nevermind comedies, actually have a story arc where the main character,<br />instead of going through some process of healing his inner child, or whatever, improves himself by becoming a better member of society?<br />What's the last comedy you saw that both made you laugh and made you think?  (Heck, how many do either?)  If you think about it, this movie<br />runs counter to two of the worst trends in modern culture, the appalling focus on the self, and the annoying tendency to dumb art down so that<br />it can be marketed acrosssocietal and national borders without losing anything in the translation.  Make a movie for the purposes of selling it<br />to teens and to China and you're going to have to go with scatology instead of metaphysics.  Thus, it's increasingly rare to find a movie that<br />requires that your synapses actually be firing, much less one that causes them to fire more quickly.<br />NBC has done something quite savvy and socially useful in recent years; they've turned It's a Wonderful Life into a Christmas-time event.<br />Sure it was great when local PBS stations played it incessantly and we all learned the script by heart, but there's something more appealing<br />about turning it into a shared viewing experience for the nation, one that hundreds of thousands of homes are tuned into at the same time.<br />We've so few rituals left that bind us together as a community that perhaps one of the best services the television networks can provide is to<br />establish a few holiday traditions, revolving around movies, or other specials, that they'd show yearly.  Besides Wonderful Life and TNT's<br />Christmas Story marathon and ABC's showing of The Ten Commandments around Passover, someone could show Gettysburg on the 4th of<br />July; PBS could re-air Eyes on the Prize around Martin Luther King, Jr. Day; show Young Abraham Lincoln on President's Day; etc., etc.,<br />etc.....  And show Groundhog Day you know when--it's a classic, let's treat it like one.  No, seriously...<br />GRADE : Aal borders without losing anything in the translation.

0446608955|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has a rare talent.  His mastery of the written word is best described as artful, clever, crafty, insightful and filled with emotion.  There is an uncommon vividness one reads within the pages of his novels.  He is an artist who paints a picture with words.  Good writers can create pictures in one's mind; thus, giving the reader a feeling of watching a film rather than reading a book.  I see this quality within the pages of A WALK TO REMEMBER.<br />Another rare quality within the pages of A WALK TO REMEMBER is much more difficult to articulate.  This novel brings forth an intense emotional reaction.  As I read it, my mind returned to a time in which I felt less jaded.  The feelings of \\"first love\\" experiences emerged.  For a time, I felt younger and later yearned for a past where I embraced optimism in a loving relationship.  \\"What could have been?\\" I privately asked in self-reflection.<br />As I ponder on the plot within A WALK TO REMEMBER, I am pulled back to reality.  My critical analysis suggests that this novel is nothing special.  There are no big surprises in the story line.  However, the profound elegance of this novel is not in the plot, but the grandeur of the author's ability to write and seduce the reader to unconsciously digging deep for emotions rarely felt.  There is a quiet intensity within these pages.  I have read all of Sparks' novels.  None of his other books possess such an emotional reaction.
B000002LK1|5.0|For any new Depeche Mode fan, VIOLATOR is a necessity. David Gahan's (Lead singer) voice is so smooth and sultry in this album, VIOLATOR should clearly be labeled as an aphrodisiac! From the well-known favorites such as &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; and &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; to the enrapturing &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Sweetest Perfection&quot;, not one song on this album lacks in anything.

B00005QIPH|4.0|Forget about all the media-spun drivel about the Strokes reinventing rock 'n roll. The Strokes debut album is simply down and dirty 3-chord garage pop writ large. And damn if it ain't well-crafted, head-bobbin' 3-chord garage pop at that. Much like when Green Day's Dookie was released, creating a manufactured crusade by the music press to herald the second (third? fourth?) coming of \\"Punk\\" (har, har), the Strokes are not here to save, reinvent, rediscover almighty guitar-bass-drums Rock 'n Roll. They're here to please our inner ear with pleasure hooks and hummable melodies. What is important about the Strokes (just as it was with Green Day) is that it has people (even the whiney curators of the Rock 'n Roll museum) talking passionately about whatever the hell this music is (Rock? Pop? Garage? New Wave? Retro? Eh, whatever....), as opposed to how many units the new boy band album shifted last week. (Or, even worse, the latest Rolling Stone treatise on the Death of Rock and Roll.) Give in. Listen to it. Enjoy. I did.

For their fourth album, released in late 1988, Metallica shows the fans what they can really do.<br />A new line-up is present on this album. Due to the tragic death of original bassist Cliff Burton in a bus accident more than a year earlier, the band recruited Flotsam and Jetsom bassist Jason Newsted who, although not having the audacious bass prowess of Burton, is a good addition to the band. The rest of the line-up remains the same. James Hetfield, the mastermind behind the band, resides over guitars and vocals, spewing forth angry, topical lyrics while pounding our riffs. Kirk Hammett follows suit on the riffs and stands tall when its time for his solo. Lars Ulrich's best drumming can be found on this album: strong, consistent and fast, completing the Metallica assault.<br />The album begins with Blackened, which is a fast and hard opener. James and Kirk throw the riffs at you while Lars and Jason set strong rhythm. The title track is a 9 minute plus epic that is simply incredible. Wonderful lyrics, awesome guitars, perfect rhythm, great solos. Eye Of The Beholder is a bit different. It has a darker tone and a slower tempo than the first two but the vocals, guitars, and drumming are great. One is a masterpiece. With lyrics based on the book Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo, the song starts slow with some clean guitar and evolves into a powerful piece of metal. This song is definitely a landmark in Metallica's career and Hetfield's songwriting. The speed picks back up with The Shortest Straw, which is another all-out song with great guitar and cool lyrics. Harvester Of Sorrow is another slower song, like Eye Of The Beholder but without the dark tone. The riffs and rhythm are heavy but played at a slower tempo while not sacrificing strength and power. The Frayed Ends Of Sanity is one of my favorites because of the power, speed and lyrics of the song. The song opens with chanting and bursts into a harsh song about insanity. Awesome song. To Live Is To Die, the last song the band wrote with Cliff Burton, is another one of the magnificent instrumentals the band is known for, but this one tops them all. The song starts clean and works it way into slow distorted riffs and rocks on from there. The finest moment of this song is when all the instruments become quiet and a lone guitar plays a clean, classical line and evolves from there. The song blasts straight into the final track, Dyer's Eve, which is the fastest and angriest song on this album, or maybe even faster and angrier than anything they've ever done. Lars' double bass drumming is beyond awesome, the guitars are extremely fast and the vocals and lyrics are wonderful. Awesome closing track. <br />Now, over 13 years since its release, And Justice For All stands as one of Metallica's best efforts. Fast, loud guitars over powerful rhythm is the style and they do it best on this album. Metallica fans will be pleased as well as fans of other metal bands (Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer). This album is another Metallica masterpiece. Pick it up.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Ok, now I've finally met my match.  \\"Oops...I did it again\\" by Britney Spears, now where do I begin?  Well, I have owned the album for about 6 months now, and its time I give my opinion, not that its gonna make a great difference on a product like this.  Well here I go.  Britney is one of those artists that you can only take in with doses, sort of like Eiffel 65, Sarina Paris, ATC, Ace of Base, Christina Aguilera and so on... Don't get me wrong, Britney is a good artist, and like every artist in the industry, she has her moments.  With this album, she does nothing to explore anything different in the music world from anything she has done on her first album.  Lets just say that if you own \\"Baby...One More Time\\", you also own \\"Oops...I did it again\\", cause there isn't much of a difference.  She definitely didn't mature any between albums, just look at the titles.  While Britneys music is very contageous, its also very annoying at times.  Britney has been done before many times, just another teen artist to come and go, sorry to admit that, but its the truth.  So lets all enjoy Britney while shes here.  Not that my opinion matters very much, but thats the way I see it.
B000002UCN|3.0|All you need to know about the production value of this album can be summarized by the glaring error found in the all-to-brief liner notes:  &quot;Produced by Geroge Harrison.&quot;  Plus, George Harrison already has a greatest hits album.  It's called &quot;All Things Must Pass, one of the top 10 albums in rock history.  Even the worst ATMP track surpasses supposed 'greatest hits' like &quot;You.&quot;<br />Okay - here's one reason to own &quot;Best of...&quot;:  If you don't own a copy of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; or otherwise don't have a track of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; buried somewhere in your CD collection, then I recommend buying this CD.  It's a song with such a universal message and brilliant simplicity that it will be playing every day the sun shines after a &quot;long cold lonely winter&quot; 300 years from now.
B000002P2V|5.0|Looking for a HARD rock album? \\"Who are you\\" is what you are looking for. I will tell you about it. \\"New Song\\" starts the album with a eletric gutair sound. That is is one of my favorites. \\"Had Enough\\" is a song writen by John but sung by Roger. This is also one of my favorites. \\"905\\" is also good and its writen by John and he sings it. One of my other favorites is \\"Sister Disco\\". My Mom said it was a hit. \\"Music must change\\" is also good. One of my other favorites is \\"Who are you\\". A great album for all music lovers!!!![....]
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira can easily be compared with other great talents. I believe Shakira is one on her own. She's beyond talented. And her English debut proves my opinion. Laundry Service delivers a blend of music genres (Rock, pop, world) with lyrics from the hand of Shakira herself and a voice from the soul. Shakira's first single, Whenever Wherever, interested me. Then I saw the video, and was hooked. I bought Laundry Service and was captivated by what I heard. Every song on Laundry Service is worthy. The highlights are Whenever Wherever, Underneath Your Clothes, Fool, Te Dejo Madrid (I really need to learn Spanish, but I didn't care what she was saying, she sounded great and the beat's just right), Poem to a Horse, and Eyes Like Yours. Those are my tops, but the others are very awesome. For someone who writes and sings her own songs, and also helped produced her album, I say kudos to Shakira, Keep it alive.
B00005A46T|1.0|ok ppl. Da only thing good about this CD is to play the music &amp; scare ur lil sis/brotha out of ur room. Well peace out my sistaz and brothaz
B00000DFSK|5.0|this cd is great, but it should have been in chronological order and have more songs on it like one tree hill, bullet the blue sky, red hill mining town,40, two hearts beat as one, gloria etc etc, when love comes to town is their weakest song of the best of.There are better songs to put on.<BR>Anyway to the one who asked what album dancing barefoot was on months ago, it is on this cd, just the b sides and it is not a U2 song.It is just a cover.<BR>Hope you come back to read this time.<BR>you should have left your e-mail.
B000000OAC|5.0|Let me say right up front that I have been a Queen fan since I was approximately 14 years old (let's just say a couple of decades and leave it at that!), so I may not be the most objective when it comes to reviewing their albums. However, I felt I had to put down my thoughts on what I consider their best work. I think I like this one the best because it flat out rocks in comparison with the rest of Queen's output. From the tribal drumming of the classic opener &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; to the final strains of the epic rocker &quot;It's Late&quot;, this album rarely lets up. The anthem &quot;We Are The Champions&quot; is a modern standard; &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; and &quot;Get Down Make Love&quot; are wild stompers; &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot; should've been a massive hit (was it ever a single?); drummer Roger Taylor takes the lead on &quot;Fight From The Inside&quot;, another one of his great rockers; and Brian May's &quot;Sleeping On The Sidewalk&quot; is just fun, straight-ahead rock 'n' roll. If you have any doubt that Queen truly rocks, check this one out. The album closer, &quot;My Meloncholy Blues&quot;, is fitting. You'll need something to chill out to after rocking out for so long. A classic in a canon that is hard to match in rock history, IMHO.
0064409422|5.0|Having seen the animated version of this book at the age of about ten, I had always wanted to read the series. I eventually stumbled across a copy twenty years later; now a teacher and a mother...and I was completely hooked! Although all the books were primarily written for children, I would strongly urge adult readers to pick up a copy of any or all in the series. CS Lewis possessed a remarkable imagination, and he has very cleverly crafted the Christian story into this tale of magic and fantasy. <br />The book opens with a game of hide and seek; the start of a journey of discovery for four British children over an otherwise dreary holiday with a reclusive professor. They enter the world of Narnia through a cupboard and discover a faun, a lion, a witch and a whole cast of interesting characters. The book covers themes such as lying, loyalty and unselfishness in a healthy and consequential way. What is so nice about this book, is that it can be read as part of the Chronicles of Narnia, or simply enjoyed as a masterpiece in itself.<br />What I enjoyed most about The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (and the others in the Narnia series) is the way in which Lewis was able to portray the Lion, Aslan (Christ). He managed to give him a devastating sense of power and even anger, while never losing the love, humility and gentleness that captivated the four children.<br />On a deeper level there are many underlying spiritual themes that would take more than a review to get into! Once I had closed the last book, I wanted to embark on a whole series of cross-curricular lessons and hit the closest school! It was inspiring.
0307155102|5.0|I came across this book on..., and I remember being read Richard Scarry books (especially this one) when I was a child. Now, I'm having a little girl of my own, and I'm buying this book tonight. Find out what all the other reviewers are talking about, and buy a copy for your child too.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Ive been a fan of Dream Theater for about a year and a half now, and every album that I bought opened up a whole new world of musical posibilities. They just kept surprisng me with new and interesting sounds. After hearing Scenes from a memory I thought there was no way they could top themselves. Leave it to Dream theater to prove me wrong.<BR>Cd 1 kicks off with a powerful and heavy tune The glass prison, wich inmediatly takes you by the throat and lets u know that the 23 bucks you just shelled out were worth it. The cd passes by more mellow tracks like Misunderstood and the closing song Disspear (wich reminds me a lot of Space dye vest). This first cd reminds me of the Awake cd, with a kind of darker, heavier sound. Needles to say, it just leaves u drooling. But then u put on CD2, the title track, Six degrees of inner turbulence. This one takes the cake! Only comparable to their own A change of seasons, this 42 minute MASTERPIECE is no short of a piece by Bethoven. This song alone is worth paying the full price of a double cd. Words cant begin to describe just how amazing this piece of music is!!!!! they have truly outdone themselves. My hat is off to the kings of prog metal.<BR>The one bad thing of the album is that James voice is sometimes pushed a bit back, even though his performance on this album is really impecable, it kind of makes him sub par with the rest of the band. GO BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!
B00005UEAR|5.0|I'm not a musician like many Dream Theater fans are, but I do know brilliant and original music when I hear it.  I've been a DT fan since \\"When Day & Dream Unite\\" and every one of their albums have be great, some greater than others...this being on of them.  How can you not like a band that gives us a 2 disk studio release?  A thematic album that addresses many of the moral woes our society faces today.  There is a lot of experimental stuff on this album, mostly on the first disk.  All the songs a solid DT tunes, but every once in awhile you can here a sprinkling of heavy unfluence such at Metallica and TOOL.  The second album is stays mostly true to DT stable sound.  Fans who like thier music varied should love this CD, fans of DTs staple sound will probably only like the second CD.  Regardless, once again DT presents undeniable proof that they are 5 of the most talented musicians in rock/metal/prog today.
B000002BE9|5.0|I was fortunate to catch the last 5 seconds of the video for Shadowboxer on my local PBS station when this disc was released. Off of that 5 seconds I went out and bought this CD. This is a great disc. Her lyrics are smart. Every song is good. Smooth Like Honey is beautiful in its mood. While there are those who believe Criminal and Sleep to Dream are the best songs from this disc, I contend that Shadowboxer is the shinning gem. As with When the Pawn, if you like music buy this disc.
B00005U1YO|4.0|Subtle textures, multiple overlays, and driving catchy beats.  Unlike the beginning of this review, &quot;Come with Us&quot; has both subject and verb.  This album forsakes the &quot;radio station&quot; playability of surrender for melliflous syncopated compositions.  Songs like My Elastic Eye are mature answers to the non-questions posed by the last Crystal Method album.  Repeated listenings are rewarded by the intricate construction of most songs.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|If you appreciate music buy this disc. I bought this disc note unheard the day it came out and was not disappointed.The lyrics, the instrumentation, and her voice are all equally important in weaving the spell that is this disc. Smartly written, the lyrics are refreshing in their intelligence. Yes, this is a great disc. <BR>She is truly talented musician and lyricist. Also great in concert. I await her next effort..................
B00001QGPR|5.0|While many other aging artists are living in the past, and just re singing the same old songs, Bowie is changing himself once again. Hours was his most mature and focused work in quite some time (though outside was brilliant). This album is a very dark, low album, but this time Bowie's being honest and more straightfoward. He's had a fantastic career, infact in the seventies he released 12 of history's greatest albums. I hope that he continues to release strong, great releases like this for many years.
B00005B4GU|5.0|and this album just shows why. we didnt have to wait long for another one! my full review is in the Special Edition, which i reviewed back in june. if i had my pick of this or Kid A, i would pick Kid A... this album has great tracks, but this album has more standout tracks and fillers than the others. still, its radiohead. the best band ever. if you are in an experimental mood, or just want a breath of fresh air in music definately try this!
B00003ETOW|5.0|If you like Jane Eyre then this one is a must. I have seen other versions of this movie but this one is the best.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Weve got so many new, fresh singer/songwriter pop/rock singers now.  John Mayer, Pete Yorn, and Rufus Wainwright to name a few.  They are all great.  Pete Yorn and Rufus Wainwright have so many similar qualities, but John Mayer also sticks out.  His stuff is mostly acoustic, and leans toward the sounds of Dave matthews without all the instruments.  The lyrics are definately clever (e.g. she leaves a toothbrush at my place, as if i had the extra space) and well thought out.  He seems very nieve, and the cover of the album hints at that.  I see a bright future for John Mayer.  He's been able to put out this great of an album, and barely old enough to drink.
1558216847|5.0|Wow....I hardly have the words to describe how much I admire this book, and more so, the people we meet during the &quot;walk&quot;. This is a true life Odyssey, and Rawicz is our Oddyseus. From a cursory glance at the outline of the book one may think this is simply an &quot;adventure&quot;, but it is so much more than that. The courage, fearlessness, ingenuity and determination of Rawicz and his compadres should be a shining example to anyone who is looking for heroes in these compromised times. I couldn't put it down after I started.....highly recommended.
B00004Z459|2.0|it seems like these guys have had their incredible success from being the right band with the right song at the right time.  the album wasnt selling so hot until the summer, when they were on tour, and In the End was just coming out.  the album is nothing spectacular. you can get the same kind of recycled rap/heavy rock [stuff] in just about any other band today. everyone owns this album, and i just dont see anything special with it.  that guy that sings is so annoying. he doenst have that great of a voice, and has developed an annoying scream/sing... if you want something special with true musicianship, try something esle.
B00005JKES|5.0|Yes, this is a great set, and one I've been waiting for for years. BUT FIRST be sure to also order the pilot, which introduces you to the story and the characters. I didn't realize that &quot;Episode One&quot; meant the first episode AFTER the pilot, got all cozy on the couch ready to finally share one of the best series ever shown on Television with my daughter, who was too young the first time around, only to discover it starts AFTER the pilot. A huge disappointment. So BE SURE to get the pilot first, because that sets the tone for the whole series.
B00005QXDD|5.0|i got this album thinking i would be in for great laughs.  i got that, but i also got a true, great musicianship. jack black has an awesome voice, and can hit just  about any note he tries.  Wonderboy is the stand out track on this album... its such a great song... this album is for mature audiences only.  that little label on the corner of the cd isnt htere for anything.  but if you are looking for the comedic album with true musicianship as well, your prayers have been answered!
B000002KBU|4.0|Do you like truly talented artists who write 90% of their own material? \\"Blue\\" is full of thoughtful lyrics, raw and emotional - the kind of music I can listen to for three days straight without tiring of it.     Note for those who would start an \\"experience\\" with greatest hits compilations: four out of ten songs on \\"Blue\\" made it to the \\"Hits\\" and \\"Misses\\" collections, which are to date the only compilations of Ms. Mitchell's work.    I would put this album in the folk category, although Mitchell's talent (on other albums) has extended beyond classification of the artist. I compare \\"Blue\\" to Neil Young (ATG), Janis Joplin, Gordon Lightfoot, James Taylor. So why only four stars? I consider eight out of ten songs to be superlative - worthy of a favorite. And besides, who reads five star reviews when there are so many?     One additional tip - shop for it.
B00005U1YO|3.0|This album is good, and what you would expect from the Chemical Brothers.  I'm still trying to decide if that is a good or bad thing.  There are some great standout tracks here, like &quot;Star Guitar&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; (from the Tomb Raider Soundtrack), and &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;... but the beats get a little repetitive and long on the album.  It just doenst keep my attention as well as Dig your own hole or Exit Planet Dust did.  I dont know... well its a solid CD and a must have for any fan, but i still think Crystal Method's Tweekend or Basement Jaxx's Rooty are superior.  If you are just now getting into the Chemical Brothers, Dig your own hole is their classic, and it forever will be.  It seems they have gone downhill on this one... there seems to be alot of fillers.  anyway, its still good for a couple of songs.  this is basically a just-for-fans album.
B000006OAM|5.0|Ophelia is Natalie Merchant's second solo album, and my favorite. The music is rich in cellos, violins, violas, and has a lot of guitars. There is even an instrumental version of the song Ophelia, played by an orchestra.<br />The lyrics on this album are straightforward, but they never sound preachy to me. They are not as intricate as on her first album, which only makes them clearer, not less poetic. She talks about loss, sorrow and despair, but she also talks about gratefulness, hope and seeing things differently.<br />Personally, I like the song \\"Kind &amp; generous\\", it seems like an honest song by the artist, but I would really have doubts about her honesty if half the songs on the album would be like that one; simple, catchy and upbeat. I still sing to it without shame.<br />The album's sleeve is supposed to be related to a 22 minutes movie where Natalie plays \\"Ophelia\\", but sadly, internet searches reveals it nowhere to be found! The pictures are also an illustration of the song \\"Ophelia\\", still, it is one strange sleeve.<br />Ophelia is also a chance to discover a very special voice: Karen Perris of \\"The innocence misson\\", as she sings on two of the tracks.
0451526295|5.0|Wow.  That was the one word that popped into my mind when I put this novel down at its close.  There is nothing else to describe it so perfectly.  This, after Pride and Prejudice, is my favorite Jane Austen novel.  It has a faster pace than her other books and is easier to read without tiring.  This book is about a young girl, Fanny Price, who is a poor relation, sent off to live with her wealthy aunt and uncle.  Once there, she is befriended by her cousin, Edmund, and falls in love with him.  He is her greatest friend and the only one who truely appreciates her.  All around her is high society, courtships, heartbreaks, and scandals.  Fanny thinks all is lost until the final scandal and the realization by her cousin of what is truelly important to him, and to all.  This is a very, very, very enjoyable book, and one of the best ever written.

B00005JKT8|4.0|I couldn't have dragged my husband to this movie for anything.  Besides, I would have never heard the end of it if I had.  So I saw it with my friend, Joyce, instead, and we both had a Hugh Jackman fantasy-filled afternoon.  Yes, Jackman is the #1 reason to see this film.  He is a wonderful leading man, fulfilling all of the promise he showed in \\"Someone Like You.\\" He is just perfect as the English duke transported to present day Manhattan from his own days in the late 1800s, prior to his inventing the elevator. Meg Ryan is fine as his love interest but has the hairdo from hell through most of it, which is very distracting.  Also, she is often on the edge of being annoying to the viewer with her \\"Ryanisms\\", that we've learned via her earlier roles, but basically her chemistry works with Jackman. That's all that is required because women will want to see this film for Jackman. This is a light as a feather romance that is a feel-good film throughout for the viewer.  If you are looking for weightier fare, this is not it.  For what it is, light romance, it was a perfect Friday afternoon's matinee for me and Joyce.
B000002UAX|5.0|As a band, The Beatles never did sing/play more than they genuinely were able. Nor did they pretend ever to be something they weren't. The White Album subtly put this theory to the test when these 30 tracks came together unlike any musical undertaking. The FabFour combined both their talents and charisma on this album, by which all members actively helped to write and produce.<br />   In order to constitute the best, they were aware all songs could not crack hard guitar smiles or sustain any overwhelming Birthday greeting. Prudence it seems ordained herself in Rocky Raccoon's conscience as he transfixed concern within himself about his friend Bungalow Bill whom he honestly couldn't believe lived a sane life alone and on the indefinite saga would progress...<br />   Through Rock `N Roll, The Beatles wrote, recorded and toured countries manifesting songs the best they knew how hoping the public majorities would share and benefit from their musical contributions. This they achieved as The White Album ultimately became more than less the epitome of their career/influence at least without label monies or critical acclaim posing bounded restriction.
B000002G8L|5.0|I agree with all these reviews - this is a 5 star album - but why didn't anyone mention what a great treat it is to hear Clapton and Albert Lee (one of the preeminent country guitarists alive today) going back and forth - check out Further on Down the Road for some great duets - this is my favorite EC album.
1878424319|5.0|This book was short and simple. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book in one evening. It would help anyone pursue true peace and happiness in their life. I would highly recommend it!
B000055ZB8|4.0|I was most struck by the acting of the characters, which was very exaggerated. It has been said that Nosferatu's actors were directed this way because it was German expressionism. Even so, it seems that many older films have rather unrealistic acting and, in talkies, unrealistic modes of speech, such as the vocal inflections and accents. Since there was no talking in this one, the latter doesn't apply, but no doubt that would have occurred had there been. Much of the physical mannerisms appeared influenced by stage acting, which is understandable since the actors would have had experience in only that sort of setting. Nonetheless, all of this didn't detract from the film and made their emotions much more obvious to an audience that can't hear them speak.<br />I seem to remember the film Metropolis being at a higher than normal speed, like it was filmed at 15 or 20 frames a second and sped up a little. Most of Nosferatu appeared to have been filmed at a higher frame rate with only a few parts at accelerated speed for a purely artistic effect. In fact, much of this film seemed slowly filmed, with subtle, extended shots. The most notable is when the vampire is coming into the protagonist's bedroom for the first time. He very slowly creeps in, for almost equally creepy effect.<br />There seemed to be a fascination with tall buildings, prominent shapes, and framing symbols. In Nosferatu, the dominant shapes are arches and windows. I am not certain what, if any, metaphorical symbolism is meant by this. However, it does serve to show us how tall the vampire is when he stands in an arch and how much the city folk stay in doors, only peaking out through a window occasionally.<br />What I disliked about the film was the length of this particular cut. Due to the absence of recorded vocals, it would be best to limit the length of silent films to about an hour, give or take a few minutes. My peak level of concentration occurred at just before the hour mark, and the last 30 minutes seemed to burden my patience somewhat. I can definitely see the utility of the shorter Nosferatu cuts that were supposedly put together.es seemed to burden my patience somewhat.

B000002NIW|5.0|this is one of my favourite albums everrrrr. along with various gothic japanese bands, but you know...hmm. uh...lol<BR>but no, really, the deftones are absolute geniuses and if you get any album by them you should get around the fur. one thing i've noticed about the deftones is that there's a certain part you look forward to in each song, and that part is sooo awesome it's beyond words. i think i sound dumb, but you know...<BR>um. my favourites on around the fur are headup, be quiet and drive (far away) and around the fur. BUY IT! BUYYY ITT!!!!
0062502182|5.0|I read this book two years ago in Spanish. The friend who recommended it to me, said the Spanish translation was better than the English. The most important part, I read it when I was in the Sahara, so I could let my soul fly with the story. Feel the Wind, feel the Sun, feel the Sand. I guess you have to be in the right mood to fully appreciate the teachings.
0345350499|5.0|You could almost swear by the way it was written that The Mists of Avalon tells of real historic personages and not just those whose existence is still disputed by scholars today. We get more than just the usual peek at the characters, especially the women, than is usual in Arthurian novels; Marion Zimmer Bradley, through writing that gives the impression of being well researched, bares the psyches of her characters to us, giving compassion and kindness to even those considered villainous (Mordred and Morgause), and a hardness typical of being very human to some usually admired (Guinevere/Gwenhwyfar).<BR>     The only thing here that could possibly dismay close followers of Arthurian stories is the lack of the Merlin's immense participation all throughout. For although we are told that he is present at the important events in society, not much is gleaned about what he is really like on the inside, as he is uncharacteristically written about more casually than some other protagonists of the story. However, maybe this is the tale that diminishes the Merlin's role so that readers could more substantially know about the others. After all, there have been other books written about the Merlin, as well as of the escapades of the Knights of the Round Table. The Mists of Avalon takes but a different approach to the oft-repeated yarn, albeit one that is a uniquely sensitive and very three-dimensional retelling. It is a beautiful book.
B00005JKMO|2.0|I went to the movie theatres expecting this great movie, because that is what Will Smith usually gives us. The first hour and a half was very choppy and didn't have any sort of flow. The last hour and a half made some sort of sense. I would recommend to rent this at home and not waste your 7 bucks. Ali turned out to be a very long-winded, not-exciting movie and I almost felt like walking out.
B00001QEBQ|1.0|I've read many plays about Mulan. I've read many ballads of Mulan. I've saw many movies about Mulan. But, what Disney did here is an outrage. Mulan was never a victim of misogyny. In the real story of Mulan, the men who found out that she was a woman, weren't angry. On the contrary, they were pleased! Because they've underestimated what women can do. In fact, if you go through many Chinese stories and fairy tales, you'll found out that there are many female warriors and female protagonists who did not hate their own culture (let alone think it was misogynistic). Does that seem like China (or Chinese men) is misogynistic toward females? The view that Asian males are misogynistic is a stereotype. Yet, Disney played on this. For instance, in the song \\"A Girl Worth Fighting For,\\" you have the following lyrics: \\"I couldn't care less what she'll wear, or what she looks like! It all depends on what she cooks like!\\" There is nothing in Chinese literature where a women's worth is measured by her husband's belch. Then we have the character Chi Fu say, \\"She's a woman. She'll never be worth anything!\\" All lies. Where in Chinese literature do you have that saying? First, women's worth are measured by how well they cook, then they aren't worth anything!  Can Disney make up their minds about their own lies?! The real Mulan is an example for females and males alike. For instance, Chinese used the real Mulan story to motivate people to fight imperialism. The Disney executives should be ashamed of themselves. They've ruined my culture and people are buying into their lies. The movie is not structurally good, nor were the songs entertaining. This fake Mulan story was short, annoying, and insulting.
B00005RHGK|2.0|Not only should you see this feel if you need a good &quot;fright&quot; but if you need a good LAUGH! If not for the first hour of the flick I would pass this movie a no star-er! Grant it, the beggining was interesting..then, boom! By the middle it starts to loose it's impact giving it a Matrix meets Scary Movie type of feel. I'm not even going to go there with the ending..the only thing I must warn you about this film is to save your money and stay away from the sequel!
6303022901|2.0|...Amy Tan (co-scripted with Ron Bass) has an aversion toward Chinese males. If you compare the movie to the book (see my review of the novel by clicking on my name), you may remember (in the movie) Lena had an Asian American husband - he was the one who split the prices of food, household expenses, etc. But, in the book, he was white. His name was Harold Livotny. Seeing how the Asian American male has a bad enough image in Hollywood, would it really be smart to do this race change? It's no wonder that Oliver Stone executive produced this film [he grossly stereotyped Asian American males in Year of the Dragon (which he co-wrote with Michael Cimino). Joey Tai (played by John Lone) is reminiscent of Fu Manchu]. Wayne Wang (the director) has no excuse either. You may remember how he ruined the great classic novel, Eat a Bowl of Tea, by putting Christian influence in a film adaption of it (interestingly, he actually demonstrated against Stone's film: Year of the Dragon!). Yes, Joy Luck Club is emotionally good, but it should take some social and ethnic responsiblity.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Fast and the Furious..a film for everyone!! For the guys, we have the fast cars, fast girls..blah blah blah, for the chicks we have 2 essentials elements when it comes to a successful movie..Paul Walker and Vin Diesel!
B00003CXQX|5.0|A real grear disney adventure that goes right beside the other ones,not just the adventures of tom and jerry or somtin'.When i watched it,i laughed so hard,fell off my seat and rolled with my face as red as a tomato!Now,sure most disney movies have that\\"magic\\"touch...You know,the sappy love stories,most animals or humans parents dying and a song like every 2 seconds.But i think that disney thought there movies were TOO predictible,but that all changed.I wish i had the DVD with all the extras but i don't even have a DVD player:(But if you want a cartoon comedy,get this and it will be worth your money!
B00005RYP7|4.0|A couple with two children are killed in a tragic car accident.  The children go to live with former neighbors, but not happily ever after.  Red flags go up and the teenage girl begins to suspect that all is not well in the beautiful home in Malibu where they have been brought by their guardians.  The children are forced to share a room, and it appears that their surrogate parents have some serious problems.  Slowly the parents' hidden agenda is revealed and the suspense builds.  The children begin to feel like prisoners in their gilded cage and they begin to look for ways to escape.  The ending is farfetched, but all in all, this movie provides an interesting evening's entertainment.
B00005QG9J|1.0|This album is in my &quot;dating&quot; music section, right next to Dave Mathews and Blink 182.  Girls will love the simple and serene vocals and the pleasant, unaggresive guitar work.  The placid scratch work which blends in nicely with the smooth, easy listening vocals will have her loosening her blouse almost instantly. Thanks Brandon!<br />For music fans that miss the energy, anger and frustration that so delightfully make their rounds on SCIENCE and Fungus Amoungus, you are in for a listen to a different band with this release, unlike Mike Patton who this band so clearly rips off (go out and listen to Fantomas) - all that good stuff is gone.  This is a boring, uninspired, rich kid release.  Once again, money changes some of the most talented musicians I knew in the mid 90's.
B000006Z8E|4.0|This recording is an improvement over the strong but flawed debut B.D.M.S. Where it has yet to reach the levels of the next recording Io Sono Nato Libero it is still quite good throughout. As with the debut there are odd moments where the band loses all sight of any sense of melody and gets lost in abstract composition. Still, it always manages to return to that which make the outfit exceptional; strong musicianship, keen melodic sense and powerful vocals. This disc is well worth getting but Io Sono Nato Libero and Come In Ultima Cena are much better...Simon
B00005UEAR|5.0|Yet again, Dream Theater has recorded another excellent album. The variety from song to song is just incredible. There is something on this album from everyone. One of my favorite from them so far! I already can't wait for their next!
0060934913|5.0|Reveals what it is really like to be a chef -- at least in the places that Bourdain has worked. It is an engaging read, and is hard to put down.
6305364648|5.0|Arnold at his best as Agent Harry Tasker, the only man able  to foil the plans of a terrorist who is trying to bring nuclear warheads into the United States.  The big problem?  His wife and child think that he is a mild mannered computer salesman.  The even bigger problem?  His wife is starting to feel too alone because of his \\"conferences\\" and is beginning to eye other<BR>men.<BR> The action in this movie is incredible.  Arnold takes on legions of bad guys and disposes of them with the requisite explosions, gun shots, sheer muscle, and sarcastic comments. Jamie Lee Curtis plays his wife Helen with the suitable mousy-ness which comes totally unhinged at one point to show the lioness beneath.<BR> Tom Arnold plays Harry's sidekick and is surprisingly good with the comedy as is character actor, Bill Paxton.<BR> More sensitive people might find this a little too timely at this point in our history but others, such as myself, find it extremely cathartic and a tad patriotic.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The Fellowship of the Ring demanded a powerful soundtrack to meet its intensity, and in Shore's scores, it received it. The music is incredible, it left me wanting to listen to it more all day long.  The music is absolutely beautiful, but it also is powerful, a combination rarely heard in current soundtracks.  The soundtrack brings to mind images of the movie, unfortuantely, that includes orcs :o)  Even if you haven't seen the movie, this soundtrack is worth every penny.  I am absolutely impressed with Shore's brillance in writing this music and I cannot wait for the next two soundtracks to come out!
B00005JKMO|4.0|The movie focuses on the time between when a young Cassius Clay first wins the Heavyweight Championship of the World from Sonny Liston and when a 32 year old Muhammad Ali regains the Championship from George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle.  The movie focuses less on Ali in the ring and<BR>more on his life outside.  You see the multiple marriages, his conversion to Islam, his fractured relationship with Malcolm X, and most importantly his battle with the United States Courts when Ali refused to serve in Viet Nam.<BR> Michael Mann directs this in his usual visual intense style.  If you have ever seen a production by Mann (Miami Vice, The Last of the Mohicanns, and The Insider to name a small few) you know that he deals with a variety of colors to focus the movie and the scenery tells the story almost as much<BR>as the script.<BR> The acting is superb by almost everyone involved in the movie but a few people really stand out.  Will Smith proves that Robert De Niro is not the only one who will gain weight by packing about 20 to 30 pounds of muscle on his frame and then completely immerses himself in the cadence and style<BR>of Ali's speech.  Few actors today would seem to have the capability to spout off some of Ali's tirades as Will does.  Jamie Foxx does an incredible job as Bundini Brown.  His breakdown on drugs and the fight back to sobriety shows that this former In Living Color co-star can handle a great deal more<BR>than we originally thought.  The surprise of the movie was Jon Voight. People have portrayed Howard Cosell before but Voight actually becomes him. He sounded like Cosell and the make-up job was so detailed that I had to look a couple of times before I was able to actually recognize Voight.  The relationship between Ali and Cosell is played up on many levels showing how<BR>each actually helped catapult the other into the levels of stardom that they reached.<BR> The movie is very, very well done.  The script was tight and didn't stray into too manyareas that would have dragged the movie down.  The direction was on top and the dialogue was rapid fire and concise.
B00005M6AP|5.0|This &quot;album&quot; with the others they have are &quot;great&quot;. The voice of &quot;Klaus&quot; is so... Clear with such a &quot;vibrant&quot; sound. They, are the &quot;Best&quot; Band out there! Keep-up the good work guys!!

B000001FQ4|5.0|I know some other folks here have said different, but as I've aged, I've come to realize that this is Thin Lizzy's best work.  Its the one that has the most staying power.  Its a far cry from the mindless metal they hashed out at the end of their career.
B00005JKQX|5.0|tHE HOOPLA THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON ABOUT THE SCREENPLAY NOT BEING TRUE TO THE BOOK IS NONSENSE. HOW can you squeeze a very long biography (very well written) into two hours? Impossible.<BR>What I would like to say that the screenwriter is a genius. For perhaps the first time you, yourself discover what it is like to be metally ill. It shows you how these people are treated by the public. But most of the credit has to go to Russell Crowe who gives a performance that should earn him an Oscar. It seems that wouldn't be enough. He becomes Nash...and at the end, looks exactly like him.He is probably the best actor working today. Watch his eyes...they tell you so much that is going on inside his mind. Jennifer Conelly is perfection, as beautiful as Alicia was, and still his. I hadn't seen Jennifer before this, but I hope they give this very talented women more wonderful dramatic roles.I have seen the film twice. Once at a preview and then at the theatre. I noticed so many things I had missed in the first viewing. The displays of love between Nash and his wife are so sweet and heart rending. Kudos to Ron Howard who deserves an Oscar. People always complain he is too saccherine. He has added the bitter with the sweet, and made a movie that will not be forgotten for a long, long time!
B000002JSV|4.0|Until I bought Powerage,I was used to punk rock(Ramones are still<BR>my favorite band),I've never had a real hard rock experienece.<BR>Altough my music taste is a bit different,I must say that Power-<BR>age is great hard rock CD,and I like it very much.&quot;Rock'n'Roll<BR>Damnation&quot;,first song,starts with great rythm section,and when<BR>Bon Scott starts to yell:&quot;They say you play too loud,well baby<BR>that's tough...&quot; you know It's the right thing!&quot;Down Payment <BR>Blues&quot; is very good song too,with nice bluesy sound,and great <BR>lyrics-&quot;I bought the cadillac,but I can't afford the gasolyne..&quot;<BR>Funny,eh?&quot;Gimme a Bullet&quot;.Lyrics-simple ballad,but it sounds amazing.I think it has best vocals on the album.&quot;Riff Raff&quot; is<BR>my favorite,along with &quot;Damnation&quot;.It's almost instrumental,<BR>'cause Bon Scott sings very little,and we can get a full experie-<BR>nce of Angus's great guitar playing.Wonderful!&quot;Sin City&quot;-best<BR>lyrics on the album,teriffic guitar playing,vocals little in the<br />backgruond.&quot;What's Next to the Moon&quot;,my least favorite song,only<BR>because of not very enjoyable chorus.The rest three songs are <BR>all very good,specially &quot;Gone Shootin'&quot; and &quot;Up to My Neck in You&quot;.<BR>Anyway,Powerage is great album.Buy it.It will serve as good intro<BR>duction to AC/DC music,and to hard  rock and metal.
B000002I27|5.0|It has taken me a while to truly appreciate and respect the Doors and although I now see them as a noteworthy band, I don't like to go overboard. Yes, they had a unique and distinct sound (though they weren't the only band making up their own rules in the 60's). I have been listening to them for about a year and a half and it is only now that I find myself pulling out their albums more than occasionally. So I now see their relevance more, but although they were a band with a unique sound and vision, they also had a fair amount of filler. This prevents a number of their albums in my mind from achieving &quot;classic status&quot;. If I had to choose one Doors album as a masterpiece, it would be &quot;Strange Days&quot;. It's not perfect but it's close. With some bands, it's hard for me to choose the strongest album, but with the Doors I find it fairly easy. Their sound was more mature and developed than on the first album, yet they were still in the prime of their &quot;classic&quot; psychedelic sound. The first seven songs are notable classics, with just two lesser songs near the end. This was the closest the band got to eliminating filler. Even these tracks beat are decent and beat out a number of songs on other albums. The album closes out with &quot;When the Music's Over&quot;, with that errie solo about three minutes in and its tense, climatic nature, leaving this album short, but sweet.
B00005UEAR|3.0|Dream Theater has been my favorite since they were Majesty- completely wiping Rush and Yes out of my head. Every offering of DT up to this set has been incredible. Expectations for this album were not extraordinarily high, as the band's fan-base is now willing to take anything from the best band in the world.<BR>  I am critical of this album, and probably the only one who will be, but I have the 2-cd set and have had ample listening time to rate it.<BR>  In a NUTSHELL, the first 3 tracks are convoluted and sound like re-hashed pieces with some unusual sound effects. So without the first 3 tracks, you have a wonderful single CD.<BR>  Next, Mr. Portnoy and his rapid double-bass mode in some of the music is becoming old. In addition, vocally, Portnoy and Petrucci have become more involved, when the band has the greatest lead vocalist on the planet in this genre. Finally- the title track is brilliant...but one issue- the overture is suberb, and one would expect the 'Grand Finale'' to be a twist on that theme. Did you notice the abrupt end, with an echo lasting a minute?<BR>  Still reeling from \\"Tales\\" being a 4-record disaster instead of a single album, this monsterous collection hints at the overindulged...but then- isn't that DT at their best? Ok, I still love them, never mind!!!
B000007MVX|5.0|Jethro Tull was probably the best band I recently discovered while going through my parent's record collection. When I realized they had a vinyl copy of \\"Aqualung\\", I had to hear it right away. Of course I'd heard the song \\"Aqualung\\" but I soon realized how much more there was to this band. My final verdict of the album was \\"pretty good\\" but I wanted to check out more albums on my own. This lead to \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and \\"A Pasion Play\\", which I now consider Jethro Tull's masterpieces. \\"A Passion Play\\" especially intrigued me, with its morbid cover and share of critical disapproval. After listening to the sample at this site, which admittely doesn't reveal much, I knew I was just going to have to hear it for myself. As rock albums, \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and \\"A Passion Play\\" are some of the most requiring of \\"a listen for yourself\\". I can only describe so much of \\"A Passion Play\\", you kind of have to hear this for yourself just to believe that Jethro Tull could pull off this 45-minute song. Yet they do, and amazingly well, always seeming to be in control of it all. \\"A Passion Play\\" is about as challenging as it gets and therefore takes some time to adapt to. Yet this is an exciting, appreciated challenge for me, hearing this band attempt something most bands would never even consider with success. Due to my love of the dark tone and themes involved, \\"A Passion Play\\" is probably my favorite Jethro Tull album, yet \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is probably its equal and will always be its only one. If your looking for a band to turn your expectations and stereotypes of rock upside down, look no further than Jethro Tull.
6305609721|5.0|The Star Trek movie series with the \\"classic\\" crew (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc.) peaked in this film, the third in the unofficial three-part \\"Death of Spock\\" saga. The story concerns Kirk and his crew, this time on a hijacked Klingon vessel on their way home to face mutiny and other charges from Star Fleet (due to their rescuing of Spock in the prior movie), only to find Earth and other planets in the grip of a devastation caused by an alien that has lost touch with whales on Earth!<br />Kirk & co. have to go back in time - to 1986 - in order to rescue two humpback whales and bring them to the 23rd Century, and save civilization!<br />Though the plot sounds convoluted, it is carried out in top-notch form. Moreover, putting the Trek crew in contemporary times, and in San Francisco, was a master touch. The clash of present and future is nothing short of brilliant, including comedic scenes that fit perfectly into the film and are not overdone. The humor, drama and adventure are mixed perfectly.<br />Each of the cast members gets to shine - something that did not always happen in the TV series.<br />A must-see movie for people and whales of the 20th and 21st century!
B000059POY|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out;  I remember all the hype.  (If you don't trust anyone over thirty, stop reading now!)  This movie is a time capsule for the late 1960's.  Non baby-boomers might simply enjoy spotting all the name stars in cameo (and fuller) roles.  Ewa Aulin does a great job in playing an impossibly naive teenager.  Walter Matthau as the horny General with his wacky paratroopers is a hoot.  Even seeing Marlon Brando in a more svelte role may surprise some.<br />If full nudity is what you are seeking, go elsewhere.  This was made in the 1960's, for commercial release and there is more tease than explictness, which can be a refreshing relief.  There is a touch of fun, rather than flaunting it all and letting it all hang out.<BR>Yes, the movie suffers from some unevenness, but is fairly faithful to the spirit of the book.  I remember reading the book, and wondered how they could ever put it on the screen.  I think they did a pretty good job for the times.<br />The music by the Byrds and Steppenwolf certainly opens up a lot of memories, especially how good some of the music of the late 1960's is.<BR>The movie is certainly not Oscar material, but neither is it in the trash bin.  It is somewhat innocent fun and if fans like performances with lechery without vulgarity, this movie will fill the bill.
0517122707|5.0|I have not read thousands of books. Not even hundreds. But I know an exceptional book when I read it. To me the fact that this book kept me from putting it down even when I was exhausted from my day was proof enough. You will not find such a great gathering of characters with such distinct and original peronalities in any other novel. A true gem. Ignatius J. Reilly will not be forgotten for as long as I live. I can only thank Thelma Toole for not letting her son's work go to waste.

0606025782|5.0|Regarded by many critics as the book that put Vonnegut on the map, it tells the tale of a man and the obserdity of religion. Vonnegut makes up his own religion (if L Ron Hubbard can do it) and his own vocabulary to illustrate that the world is the way it is because of the way we persive it and if you were to alter your perception maybe you might change the world. This book is a must for any Vonnegut fan and an easy, insightful, mesmurizing, thrill ride that will make you laugh and cry at its truth and at its absurdity.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I think certain criticisms of this movie are unfounded.<br />If you complain the movie gave you a headache, was too frenetic, or that you thought the singing was bad, I can understand.  This movie WAS very over-the-top, and opinions regarding singing vary widely from person to person.<br />However, some criticisms really make no sense to me.  One reviewer says that the movie is not really about love, that it's about movie love.  The reviewer also says the characters fall instantly into \\"genuine\\" love (thus, it's unrealistic).  <br />I see nothing wrong with the characters falling in love so quickly.  How many people complain that Romeo and Juliet fall in love too soon?  Furthermore, this movie was not even attempting to make the content realistic.  That's glaringly obvious, so why dismiss the way the characters fall in love?  The vehicle for their love was NOT a drawn out relationship, kindled over time.  The vehicle was music, as the director said, and we are supposed to understand the EMOTION of the situation, not analyze whether Satine and Christian \\"dated long enough\\" or not.  Well, you could do that, but that would be missing the point...<br />Also, many people imply the movie is obviously bad because they, or many other people in theatres, walked out in the first 20 minutes or so.  At the same time, many people say the popularity of the movie is only explained by the masses being so stupid that they don't know any better.  Now, how many idiotic movies are shown every single year that people sit through, with maybe only a few people leaving, while the others just understand the movie was mediocre or worse, or actually like them?  I don't think people walked out on the movie because it was \\"bad.\\"  I think people rejected it because it was incredibly different and in-your-face, and they it just insulted their \\"sensibilities,\\" not necessarily their intelligence.<br />Lastly, why do so many people seem to insist that the movie stank because it wasn't intellectual high art or something of the sort?  Is all art supposed to be crafted for the \\"intellectual elites?\\"  One's life will be sorely lacking in joy if they insist that all their entertainment be based on reason, logic, and intellectual \\"depth.\\"  <br />There is nothing wrong with art being colorful, frantic, passionate, and riddled with archetype.  I'd rather watch a Bacchanalian celebration of emotion, music, and sorrow than have the world overrun by only \\"highly intellectual\\" productions.  Art can appeal to the senses, the intellect, or both, and Moulin Rouge appealed to our senses and emotions.  There is simply nothing wrong with that.  You don't have to like it, but your distaste does not necessarily mean the movie is bad in itself.<br />I don't think this movie is an absolute good.  It's so unusual that some or many people are bound to dislike it.  I just think some of them expect the movie to be something that would not be an improvement over what it is, and because Moulin Rouge relies on emotion and sensuality, a purely rational critique of movie does not do it justice.<br />See it for yourself.  If it evokes wonder, excitement, sorrow, and mirth within you, it has succeeded.  If it leaves you cold, that's okay too, but I don't think such a reaction can totally be blamed on the movie--a viewer must participate with any form of art for it to succeed.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I never, ever buy cd's, or any music for that matter. I will listen to it about three times, and then it will begin to bore me. I am just not much of a music person. However, I fell in love with the Fellowship of the Ring movie, and I bought this CD on a whim. I am really glad that I did. I listen to it all the time: in the car, while I am on the computer, etc. In fact, I am listening to it even as I am typing this review. <BR>   The music is so exciting, bold, and reminiscient of the very beauty and life of Middle-earth. It is a shame that the CD is not longer than 70 minutes. It is worth the purchase however.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I finally saw this after hearing so much both pro and con about it.  I have friends who saw it 4 or 5 times the first week it came and and who raved about it, and friends who thought it was the stupidest movie they had ever seen.  I have to give the director credit--this is nothing like any movie I have seen before--the idea is unique, the visuals are stunning, but it just doesn't hang together the way it should.  Part of the reason is the ridiculously simplistic story line, but mostly  I think it fails because the editing is poorly done.  At no point in the film does the editor slow down long enough to let you really see anything, and the effect which is at first energizing and creative becomes annoying, and dizzying.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is the best movie ever made.  Everything about it is perfect.  This is my all-time favorite movie.  A must-see.
B00005U1YO|5.0|This record blows your mind off, when you hear it. Chemical Brothers have turned to other styles of music, I guess, you already have the feeling, when the first track is on. This is a really great record. Melodious and fantastic just like Denmark, where I live...although It Begin In Afrika.<br />The record contains the sounds of fresh funk (Galaxy Bounce and Denmark), the melodious riffs mixed with haunting drumbeats (My Elastic Eye and Star Guitar), the adventurous kinds of music (Pioneer Skies and The State We're In, with Beth Orton), the groovy parts of the junk (It Begin In Afrika and The Test, with Richard Ashcroft), and of course the great high points of the CD (Come With Us and Hoops). All in all a great record, making your day with fantastic beats and sessions.<br />It Begin In Afrika, the first single of the album, was not so successful, as the Brothers had hoped. But as Star Guitar came on the most of the dancefloors all over the world, the Brothers became more familiar with their new kind of style. Great job, Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons. Buy this record, it's absolutely worth it.
B00005NNU4|5.0|So...A long wait for this one.  I was awaiting Solar Return, but that never arrived and in its place was Wilcard.  A very nice album for TTD fans.  I don't know about this whole name change business and frankly I don't care--he's always been a bit eccentric.  Anyway, TTD's voice is so unique that no matter what he is singing about it sounds great!  I have enjoyed all of his albums and various b-sides, etc.  Sure there are few less than inspiring tracks on this album, but I challenge you to find a perfect recording anywhere, that's why I'm giving this one 5 stars.  Most of the album is true to TTD's style with a few updates here and there.  Overall the album is satisfying and I didn't mind paying a premium for it.  <BR>As for the +1, I didn't think that Testify was worth the extra $, so you can safely skip it.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is a great movie.  Bill Murray at his funniest.  And this new and improved DVD is a treat!  The first one was a &quot;bare-bones&quot; edition, with no special features.  This one is nowhere near the calibur of the latest &amp; greatest DVD's (Moulin Rouge, Episode I) as far as extra features go, but there is a great half-hour retrospective documentary featuring all the major players in this film except Bill Murray.  This movie was also one of the greatest romantic comedies (or pure comedies) of the past decade.  Bill Murray is dead-on as the weatherman who fancies himself a big-time talent and celebrity who gets stuck in a town because of a blizzard, only to be stuck there repeating the same day for seemingly forever.  I felt this movie did a great job exploring the progression of how a person would first exploit that type of situation, then get depressed by it, then accept it.  I definitely recommend this movie.
B000001ES4|5.0|This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful albums I have ever heard. I loved it so much I purchased a second copy for back up.<BR>My husband loves it as much as I do. It is uplifting and enchanting. Exquisite!

B00005UEAR|5.0|Wow. Dream Theater, my absolute favorite band since I was 8 years old back in good ol' 92. Let's get started.<br />Glass Prison- Dream Theater's salute to many obvious speed metal and thrash metal influences. This song never gets mellowed out pretty much through out the entire song. Although it's far from anything amazing, but most of the song mananges to rock your socks. Lots of stupid background stuff that grabs your attention and Portnoy's fastest performance yet. Insanity(hahahaha)!<br />Blind Faith- The beginning is almost country-western sounding with it's use of...country western riffs...Labrie's lyrics really blow the big one on this song for the most part, but DT isn't really about lyrics at all. It's probably the most rock and roll influenced song on the CD. The one that will make it to the oldies station in about 20 years. <br />Misunderstood- Sure, it may sound all pretty in the beginning, but it just gets all out creepy in the middle. Not for the musically impatient. It's very repetitive, but they show you that playing one riff and just adding to it with a lot of weird effects in the background and strings, makes it cool!<br />The Great Debate- This song majorly rips off Tool. At least 20 times. I personally think it's a lot better than any Tool album though...Lots of odd timing, some cool 7/8 stuff, and an almost 7/4 part that confused me, blasted 13/8! Petrucci's solo about 10 minutes into the song is almost funny to listen to, soooo fast! Portnoy's best performance on the entire CD, he's the highlight of the song. Best song on Disc one. Labrie mananges to sound like Maynard from Tool a few times actually...<br />Disappear- ...that is absolutely the most eerie/beautiful song they've ever written. Makes Space Dye Vest(off of Awake) sound Happy. Great song. The first 3 minutes are in 5/4, no one cares accept me! Nooooooo!<br />SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE...-Possibly the most beautiful, rockin, heavy, classy, song ever written, in my opinion. 42 minutes of constant prog-genius. Definitely worth buying the CD just for the second disc alone. I really can't say anything else about the song, it'll take to long.<br />Overall, an instant prog rock classic. Maybe the best prog CD ever, next to some of their other stuff maybe. Just listen to it and find out for yourself.<br />Overall Rating- ****1/2
B0000026J6|4.0|To start, let me explain that I gave this 4 stars for a very personal, selfish reason:  the length of the cd.  I wanted more. I want more...it is just too short!<br />I just came across this cd while digging through some old boxes. How it ended up in some forgotten box, I'll never know.  But, there it was...along with some old, much loved, Sisters of Mercy, Joy Division, Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Smiths, Bauhaus and Cult cd's.  I know, I know, I know....it's atrocious that such incredible music was in the boxes.  But, I ask for your forgiveness.<br />I remember when this cd came out.  The video used to air on 120 minutes, back when MTV was halfway decent and Kevin Seal used to host 120 minutes.  The black and white video, beaches, gloom...it was awesome. The video for \\"First We Take Manhattan\\" that is.  I was mesmerized.  Where had I been this whole time L.C. was making records?  Well, it's never too late I suppose.<br />So, back when I had to slave endlessly to earn about $3.00 per hour after taxes, I saved up and went and bought the cd.  It never left my side for years afterwards.<br />Get this cd, get this cd, get this cd.  It is amazing.  It is beautiful, prolific and enchanting.  I cannot say enough about it.  I truly can't.  Give it a listen, you too will understand.<br />It has to be one of my favorites among favorites by L.C.<br />Also, check out the newly released \\"Field Commander Cohen\\" live cd.  It is absolutely one of the best cd's he has ever released.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I'm totally obsessed with this movie; I must have seen it start-to-finish over 25 times.  Boy, did I want to like this Collectors' Edition DVD, but sadly, I must announce that it's a let-down.  I'm talking about this edition, not the film itself, which other reviewers have adequately discussed.<br /><br />One thing you should be warned about: the extra features that come with this DVD, such as the documentary, \\"The Weight of Time,\\" and the \\"director's running commentary\\" option ... blow.<br /><br />The documentary was filmed just last year (2001), and many of the characters and crew don't seem to remember much about the movie, except in general terms. Bill Murray himself doesn't deign to make an appearance, even though it is frequently alleged that this film represents the best work of his now-defunct career. And this is NOT the \\"Making of Groundhog Day\\" documentary that ran on HBO when that network released the film; I have no idea where to get that well-made and amusing documentary, but be warned that THIS is not it.<br /><br />You weren't missing anything from the anamorphic thing. The anamorphic was not 1.35:1, but only 1.85:1, meaning that if you've been watching this on a normal TV and VCR combination, you haven't been missing much. It's not the revelatory experience some DVD's are.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed me to no end:  many of the scenes that were not included in the final cut of the movie do not find their way onto this Collectors' Edition DVD as deleted scenes.  Why not?  Their existence is certain:  you can hear Harold Ramis mention several of them on his commentary track.  Among the scenes I would have liked to see:  Bill Murray trashing his room (instead of merely breaking the pencil in half), and him presiding over a Fellini-esque bacchanal of freaks and cripples in his room at Mrs. Lancaster's!  For uber-fans of the film, it is immensely disappointing that these scenes were not included, since it is difficult to see how we will ever get to see them now.<br /><br />As for Ramis's commentary, it is lazy and uninteresting. There are a few moments when he shares information that you otherwise wouldn't have known (unless you've seen that HBO documentary), but for the most part his monologue is characterized by simply telling us what's going to happen, explaining what's fully obvious, echoing the lines of the characters, or simply leaving us with long periods of silence.<br /><br />I expect nothing but non-stop talking when directors do their commentaries. And friend and I were watching this, and we both FORGOT that we were watching it with the director's commentary. \\"Talk, screwball!\\" we both shouted. One shouldn't be able to get into the movie with this option on, but here his comments were either so sparse or perfunctory that we found ourselves able to.<br /><br />My rating for the movie itself couldn't be higher.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Baz Luhrman has pulled off the almost impossible. He has brought magic back to the big and small screen with Moulin Rouge. His love for cinema is apparent in this incredibly edited, hyperkinetic visual and musical feast. There has not been a sweet, magical chemistry like there is between Kidman and McGregor since Hollywood's heyday. You will either love or hate this film - there's rarely an in-between state, but if you don't suffer from vertigo (or enjoy being spun to dizzying heights) the wildly original Moulin Rouge is for you.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This DVD is the standard at which all DVD's should be measured by.  It is amazing how Disney has restored this classic onto DVD.  The special features on this DVD are endless and they are special features YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WATCH!  This film is beautiful and it should be watched by all young children.  In this time and day when childrens films are more like adult films this a wholesome childrens film that an adult and child will both love.  This is the perfect film for Disney to start their platinum collection which they will release one classic film for the next 9 years, next year Beauty and the Beast gets the great treatment I CAN'T WAIT!
B000003S5H|4.0|I didn't exptect much from a band from France (except surrender anthems), but what I heard has now raised the bar for bands from France, The US, and around the globe.  A great album from start to finish.  The albume starts out with &quot;La Femme D'argent&quot; which sounds like the opening song to a 1960's, futuristic, space exploration, blackxploitaton,  flick with bad special effects, that I haven't seen, but now must rent.  Its funky bass riffs provide a great foundation for the hauntingly familiar, spacey,  echoing, guitar and mini moog to build on.  It is like instrumental Beastie Boys meets Logan's Run meets Shaft.  It is a Must hear.
B000000H6Y|5.0|Bloody Kisses - Type O Negative<br />Category:  Goth heavy metal<br />Artist Name:  Type O Negative (TON)<BR>CD Title: Bloody Kisses<BR>Description:  Wow.  I still cannot believe how good this album is.  The songs on here blew me away the first time I've heard them, and I still, on occasion, pause to listen in disbelief at how beautiful, and powerful, the tracks are.  TON isn't for everyone, however.  Peter Steele, the lead guy in TON, has a frighteningly sensual, dark, and, some might say, Satanic voice. (My parents hate TON!)   After listening to all this other crap on the radio, music videos, and everything else, Peter's voice has a firm, soothing effect on me, that makes me really feel the music.<br />Songs:<br />1.  Machine Screw<br />My Comments:  Ok, this isn't actually a song.  It's more like an intro, but it's incredibly amazing nonetheless.  Considering how debauched and disgusting the idea of the track is, TON created it flawlessly, and, in my mind, it borders on being a work of art.  I won't say exactly \\"what\\" it is.  Listen to it yourself, and find out.<br />Rating: 10/10<br />2. Christian Woman<br />My Comments:  Possibly TON's most popular and famous, or infamous, song.  The lyrics are meaningful, but, as a whole, quite sarcastic and humorous.  I guess the way to describe this song is Peter making fun of religion in a poetic, even beautiful, way.  Indeed, the chorus of this song is wondrous to listen to, so melodic it is.   Even the second part of the song is great, with sounds of nature in the background.  I can't give this song enough credit, it is so good.<br />Rating:  10/10<br />3. Black No. 1<br />My Comments:  This song, along with Christian Woman, are Type O Negative's most well known songs.  Black No. 1 is the ultimate goth anthem ever, even though the concept of the song is making fun of goth chicks.  Something I don't understand, though, is that TON are goth themselves.  More or less.  I mean, just look at them!   Anyhow, I personally likeChristian Woman more than this song, but both are flawless works of art.<br />Rating: 10/10<br />4.  Fay Wray Come Out and Play<br />My Comments:  Personally, I find this song mildly offensive, even to one such as myself.  Like the first track, it's not an actual song.  Not really.  What I find disturbing is a voodoo sort of chant that the guys are singing in it (what exactly they are saying, I find indistinguishable!) and the pitiful cries of a woman in the background.  Although the point of the track and the name of the track is unclear, my imagination conjures a mental image of the song well enough, and that mental image, is not something I would care to dwell on.  Nonetheless, I  can't, in my right mind, take off any points of the score just for disturbing me, and, in all other aspects, it's flawlessly made.<br />Rating:  9/10<br />5.  Kill All the White People<br />My Comments:  I was not happy to hear this song.  Not that it offends me, or anything.  Using well concealed irony, the song is supposed to make fun of racists, and it does so succesfully.  Not that I enjoy the song at all.  It's just plain annoying, and has no meaning.  At least it is pretty short. (3 and a half minutes).  Still, it's somewhat tolerable to listen to, although I don't see how anyone could really enjoy it.<br />Rating:  9/10<br />6.   Summer Breeze<br />My Comments:  Without a doubt my favourite song on the Bloody Kisses album, quite possibly my favourite TON song of all time.  Apparently, this song is a remake of an old song, which my parents told me of, but not that that matters to me.  I listened to the original version by (I forget the name), and I found some bitter irony in this song:  the original song is supposed to be happy, and joyful, and, judging by the lyrics, so is this one, but that is not true.  I've actually come close to tears listening to this amazing, but somewhat short (by TON standards) track.  The only way I can really describe this song is being bittersweet.  The listener, when hearing this, has a perfect mental image of the song, so clear and blissfullly peaceful, it is unreal.<br />Rating:  10/10<br />7.  Set Me on Fire<br />My Comments:  Painfully short, but beautifully glorious.  It continues where Summer Breeze leaves off.  Unlike Summer Breeze, this song is really supposed to be happy and joyful.  And it is.  It sounds really good, though.  Really good.  This song is like nothing TON has ever done, and they made it flawless.  The whole song may be short, there may be only two lines of lyrics, but this is still one of the standout tracks on the cd.<br />Rating: 10/10<br />8.   Dark Side of the Womb<br />My Comments: Like \\"Fay Wray Come Out and Play\\", I found this \\"intro\\" sort of thing somewhat disturbing.  But keep in mind, \\"disturbing\\" is the kind of feeling TON were trying to portray when making this album.  Nonetheless, I still see no value in it.  Unlike World Coming Down, the \\"skits\\" or \\"interludes\\" on Bloody Kisses don't form together as a whole \\"experience.\\"  These skits are all independent and confusing.  <br />Rating:  9/10  <br />9.  We Hate Everyone<br />My Comments:  Considering the dark, foreboding name of the song, this track is actually quiet joyful and happy. No, I'm not kidding.  One must listen to it to understand.  The lyrics aren't hateful, as the name suggests, either.  Well, they sort of are.  But the song is actually very good, I must say.  It's nothing outstanding, though.<br />Rating:  9.5/10<br />10.  Bloody Kisses (A Death in the Family)<br />My Comments:  The cd was named after this song, and with good reason.  It is a very sad song, that makes you shed tears in sympathy for how pitiful and painful Peter's life seems to be.  This song is very powerful, and flawless, in all ways.  There is actually very little to say about this track, despite such an uncanny quality of perfection, a trait that TON is very well known for in their songs.<br />Rating: 10/10<br />11.  30 I.F.<br />My Comments:The last skit on the cd, and this is no better than the others.  It technically should not offend anyone, since I  observed no offensive content in it, but it doesn't seem to mean anything, either.  I see no significance between the name of the skit and the actual track itself.   Aside from that tedious complaint, I am unable to give it anything less than a 9/10, and so that is what I shall give it.<br />Rating:  9/10<br />12.  Too Late:  Frozen<br />My Comments:  'eh, it's ok.   Nothing spectacular, but still a very good song.   That's about all I can say about it.  Between this song and the next one (Blood and Fire and this one, both quite similar tracks) I prefer Blood and Fire.  I'm afraid to admit that this song just doesn't ahve the power that other TON songs have, and the song seems unnecasarily long, too.<br />Rating: 9/10<br />13.  Blood and Fire<br />My Comments: Great stuff.  Very good solo guitar licks, too, I must say.  Although it doesn't really compare to giants like Christian Woman and Bloody Kisses, this is still an exceptional song, and a personal favourite of many TON fans.<br />Rating:  9.5/10<br />14.  Can't Lose You<br />My Comments:  Oh God, the last song on the cd.  What can I say?  It's not too long (for a TON song, at least), there are only two different lines of lyrics, but, even with that in consideration, it's one of the most different yet good TON songs ever.  It is very sad, and, out of all the songs on the cd, the best track to end it with.  What's different about it, is the cool middle-eastern sort of guitar strings in it, giving it an exotic, exhilarating feel.  Hands down it is one of my favourite songs of all time, next with Summer Breeze.  <br />Rating:  10/10<br />Overall/average rating:  9.5  (I don't agree with that rating, though:  it gets  a 10/10, without a doubt, crappy skits put aside.)<br />The Best Songs:  Christian Woman, Black No. 1, Summer Breeze, Bloody Kisses, Can't Lose You<BR>The Worst Songs:  All the skits except for Machine Screw<br />Best Song:  Well, all I can say is that my favourite is Summer Breeze<BR>The Worst Song:  probably one of the skits, but for an actual song, it would have to be Too Late:  Frozen.<br />Highest Score:  10/10<BR>Lowest Score:  9/10
0783222955|5.0|The children Jem, Scout, and Dill have gone to the courthouse to see if they can find the basement cell where 'Boo' had been imprisoned but instead go the the second floor enterance to the courtroom.  Before them are the impressive SOLID three panel each twin doors to the courtroom beyond.  There is a glass transom (horizontally hinged ventiation and light admitting window) above both doors. Of course there is no way these short people are going to see what is going on inside from down there so Jem and Scout hoist lighter Dill up to the window via a foothold in their cupped hands.  The uppermost of the three panels in the otherwise solid doors is now clear glass besides the transom.  After Dill describes the goings on within and the trio gets caught by Atticus, the audience can see both 'morphed&quot; doors as Jem hangdoggedly explains their presence as commanded.
6303942830|3.0|I know that I must be from the \\"Old School\\" because I believe that a movie based on a piece of classic literature should at least try to stay true the book.  The makers of this movie completely destroyed Cooper's storyline, which by the way is very good.  For those of you who have not read the book, Hawkeye is a middle-aged man who is the same age as Uncas's father, Chingachgook.  Uncas is in love with Cora and Duncan Heyward is in love with Alice.  In the movie Heyward is in love with Cora and dies in her place at the hands of the Hurons; in the book he lives and ends up married to Alice.  In the movie Colonel Munro dies at the hands of Magua; in the book he lives and mourns at Cora's funeral.  In the movie Magua has this extreme hatred of Colonel Munro and his daughters; he wants to see all three of them dead.  In the book, Magua hates Munro but he admires Cora because she is such a strong woman.  Magua wants to marry Cora not kill her; his wanting Cora to be his wife is his way of getting revenge against Colonel Munro.  Magua got drunk and visited the Colonel's headquarters in his drunken state; Munro had him whipped for this.  That is the reason for Magua's hatred of Munro.  In the movie Uncas dies trying to save Alice and after he dies Alice throws herself over a cliff. In the book, Uncas dies trying to save Cora, and she is killed by one of the other Hurons.  In fact Magua is mad when she is killed.  The whole storyline about the Colonial Militia does not exist in the book.  Hawkeye is never imprisoned for helping anyone escape from the fort.  In fact Hawkeye is the one who carries the messages between Munro's fort and Webb's fort Edward.  The first Indian massacre that happens at the beginning of the movie when Magua is the \\"guide\\" also never happens in the book.  <br />About the only thing that the movie and book have in common is that Hawkeye and the two Mohicans help Cora, Alice, and Major Heyward get to the fort and also the Indian massacre that happens while the British are leaving the captured fort.<br />Several years ago, when I first watched this movie, I liked it.  After I read the book and then went back to watch the movie again, I was completely disgusted.  Cooper is very very hard to read, and I can understand why many people would rather watch the movie than read the book.  However, his book is really good and it deserved better treatment in the movie than it got.
B000002KKX|4.0|AS FAR AS FIRST ALBUMS GO , BACK IN 1980, THIS ONE RULED AT THE TIME. GREAT MUSIC AND &quot;RIDE LIKE THE WIND&quot; WAS A CLASSIC TO ME. ALL THE MELLOW SOUNDS ON THIS DISC ARE GREAT. I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEW THAT IT WAS A SHAME CHRISTOPHER CROSS NEVER RECAPTURED THE ESSENCE OF HIS FIRST ALBUM. THIS ONE THOUGH, LET HIM TOUCH THE STARS.
B000053V9F|5.0|Before I saw \\"JFK\\" I knew what, basically, everyone knows about the timeless president. I knew he was a great leader, and a good president, and that his death was a shock to the world [which illustrated how popular he was]. So, being only 15 when I first saw this film, you can forgive me for being a little ignorant about the growing resistance to JFK the President.<BR>After watching this movie, my world changed. Oliver Stone presents the picture in a way that is so easy to understand, and he gives us all the facts, and makes the conspiracy theory easy-enough to follow. This movie will make you question everything - do the CIA and FBI have a hold over the President of the biggest countries in the world? If the said President stands up for his own beliefs, is he in danger of his very life? \\"JFK\\" tells us the answer is \\"yes\\", and shows how other Presidents will be merely puppets when forces like the Secret Service are in existence.<BR>After watching this movie about 100 times, I can honestly say that I am never bored. It still leaves you with an ominous feeling of helplesness, and sorrow - but also makes you feel that you have been \\"let in\\" to the secret that has plauged the world since the 1960os. The actors are amazing - it is Kevin Costner in his best role [although he was, too, excellent in the 2001 film, \\"Thirteen Days\\"]. He can keep the viewer going for 3 hours of film, without growing tired, which is excellent. With excellent performances from Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones and a cameo from Walter Mattheu, \\"JFK\\" will open and broaden your mind and outlook, and allow you to see oscar-winning acting: a *fantastic* movie all around!
B00005QFHG|1.0|I can't believe Amazon recommended this...to ME! What a pretentious, boring, silly film. The plot is straight out of a porno: a woman moves into a small town and starts selling candies that get the natives all hot and bothered...Hoo-boy! <br />Even if you added a few gun battles and car chases into this dreck, it would probably still stink like last weeks garbage.
B00005A1PR|5.0|One day in March 2001,while I was in the car a song came on.<BR>A warm acoustic guitar riff with a snappy drum machine beat<BR>with a chrous that went like \\"I'm not your average girl /from a video /my worth is not determined by the price of my clothes.../<BR>Because I am a Queen\\".WOW! Who was that?,I'm thinking to myself.<BR>Come to find out,a young Atlanta-based soul singer-songwriter<BR>named India.Arie.That song,\\"Video\\", was what the world needed and months later,when I finally listened to India's debut,\\"Acoustic Soul\\",I thought that this album is what the world needs too.<br />FIRST THINGS FIRST,there's much more to India.Arie than the singles \\"Video\\" and the sensual \\"Brown Skin\\" display.<BR>India is a smart,moody,warm singer-songwriter who has her own sound.She's not an overdone pro-black Afro Queen but she's not your average major-label female R&B artist,either.<br />Among my favorites on this disc(and the tracks that I feel show<BR>the many facets of Ms. Arie's endless talent) is \\"Part Of My Life\\" as well as the quietly-released third single \\"Strengh,Courage,&<BR>Wisdom\\"(altough I must admit,this song is a tad earnest but that's better than mindless).<br />The thoughtful \\"Back To The Middle\\" is a strong showcase for India's guitar skills and songwriting prowess.This should be the next single.If not this,then \\"Part Of My Life\\",would do.<br />I was persuaded to review \\"Acoustic Soul\\",after this album got a<BR>Grammy nomination for Album Of The Year(beating out the more hyped up \\"Songs In A Minor\\",by you know who).I was very happy that it got nominated but I just felt that folks didn't know half of <BR>Arie's talent by this album's first two singles.<br />India.Arie stands out in the overcrowded world of contempary R&B.<BR>And I look forward to more work from her.
B00003CXXS|5.0|IT MAY SEEM WEIRD, BUT I PREFER THIS THIRD OUTING OF THE SERIES AS THE BEST. THE FIRST BLEW ME AWAY WITH THE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND THE SECOND JUST DIDNT CLICK WITH ME BUT, THE STORY IN THE THIRD ONE, ALONG WITH FANTASTIC NEW EFFECTS REALLY HIT THE PERFECT BLEND. THE PREMISE IS A LITTLE SHACKY. PEOPLE JUST KEEP GOING BACK TO THAT DARNED ISLAND TO BE KILLED. BUT THE RESCUE ANGLE DOES WORK. AND ONCE THERE THE ACTION TAKES OFF. GREAT DISC AS FAR AS VIDEO AND SOUND GO. PICTURE WAS GREAT AND SO CLEAR. GOOD MENUS FOR THE EXTRAS. DOLBY SOUND OUTDID ITSELF ON THIS SOUNDTRACK. THE RUMBLES FROM MY SUBWOOFER WERE LOW AND LOUD! IF YOU LIKE THIS SERIES THIS ONES A KEEPER.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot; is the best CD in my collection. It is original, beautiful, poignant and above all - a delight to listen to.<BR>Jeff Buckley was a man of unique charisma, and you can hear it in this album - it will change your life. His *4 octave* range will stun you into amazement, and you will fall in love with this album.<BR>Songs like &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; are really easy to listen to, and you will never tire of them; and his cover of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is [dare I say it?] better than Leonard Cohen! <BR>Jeff was such an amazing talent, and this is illustrated best with &quot;Grace&quot; - songs like &quot;Mojo Pin&quot;, &quot;So Real&quot;, and &quot;Love, You Should've Come Over&quot; will make you smile, dream and cry that this talent was lost so young.<BR>So, even if you've never heard of Jeff Buckley before, and have just wandered to this review by fate; buy this album, and I promise you, it will change not only your very existance, but your view on music. <BR>Before I heard Jeff I was hollow, but now I am complete..
B000000JO3|5.0|This is one of the best american punk albums there is!  Ian makes good points in songs, and speaks his mind.  Minor threat are defiant against the establishment, drugs, and alcohal.  Creating a movement called \\"straight-edge\\".  The music is great, except the recording is a little bad.  They have an excellent guitar player, and Ian has great shouting vocals.  This album contains all minor threat songs.  (they were only together for 3 years)  Recommended for anyone into hardcore-punk rock!
6305342776|4.0|People would kill me if they read what I'm writing about \\"The Black Hole\\".  However that's the way I feel about it.  This movie was a flop at the box office and most critics weren't so gentle with it.  But I really enjoyed this campy sci-fi flick from the Walt Disney Studios for many reasons:<br />1. I was overwhelmed by the teaser trailer (too bad it's not included on this DVD) where the green grid is moving all over the screen, ending with the Black Hole logo swifting and twisting in black.  Awesome!!<br />2. The black and yellow logo in some of the posters, the one shown on the DVD case.<br />3. The U.S.S. Cygnus.  WOW!!! What a beautiful ship.<br />4. The robots.  Maximillian truly looks menacing.  And V.I.N.CENT and Old B.O.B.; the cutest robots since \\"Star Wars\\"'s R2-D2.<br />5. The cast of outstanding performers: Maximilian Schell, Anthony Perkins, Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms, Yvette Mimieux, Ernest Borgnine, and Roddy McDowell as the voice of V.I.N.CENT.<br />6. John Barry's majestic score.<br />7. The final scene, inside the black hole.  Those images.  Those visual effects.  John Barry's music.<br />This movie might have had some flaws at describing a space version of \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\", but this is my most cherished guilty pleasure of all time.
B00005JKED|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and I have to say it is a must buy.. Washingtons \\"bad guy\\" in this movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time.. and the way it is so life like, is just outstanding... I would have to say there may be like a few errors or something but I didn't see any... last thing I have to say is: BUY THIS MOVIE NOW OR I WILL KICK U IN DA FACE
B00005UEAR|4.0|This CD sounds like a bizarre mix between Geddy Lee's solo album, Anthrax, Queensryche, and Zelda videogame music. The first disc sounds nothing like Dream Theater. If they're exploring new grounds, they better return to record pieces like the second disc, which is very good. It's a good CD, though I recommend you see them live. The experience is incredible.
B000002MG1|5.0|When I first heard this album ,I did not like the direction it was moving in.  But I listened to each individual track and let it take me anyway.  This CD has some of this great bands best lyrics.  Only one song dissapointed me (The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight, the \\"Shiny Happy People\\" of this album and just as annoying).  \\"Find the River\\", \\"Drive\\", and \\"Try Not to Breathe\\" are the best tracks.  I have listened to this band for what seems to be 200 years, and I fall in love with the music again and again with each listen.
0452282152|5.0|Griet, a 16 year old girl, narrates her two years as maid and assistant to Johannes Vermeer, Dutch 'Golden Age' Master.  During her tumultuous experience in his household, Griet becomes the subject of his most famous portrait, &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring.&quot;<br />Author Tracy Chevalier is also a Master, painting the emotions of Griet with soft sensuous strokes mixed with bold brushes of self-discovery.  Chevalier develops vivid characters, especially the artist's wife and mother-in-law.  Vermeer, is a quiet genius, but the short spurts of his voice and the movement of his eyes provide the canvas for Griet's emotions. <br />This novel is moderate in length, but I gladly would have enjoyed twice as many pages.  Chevalier leaves us staring at the painting, wondering -- as she did -- what further adventures awaited the &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot;.
6304698526|1.0|If you're expecting the original flick, this is not it.  At the end of the &quot;Chase Scene&quot;, the Charger is seen launched into the air and into the gas station.  In the original movie, they messed up and the station was blown up a fraction of a second before the car hit it.  In this version, they have altered the scene and you never see it.  My only question, WHY?!
078322799X|4.0|All I will say is that Jeffrey Combs made this movie worth watching again and buying on DVD.
0679879269|5.0|This is the third and best of these books.  The best part is all of the different worlds there are in the book.  Each chapter is action packed and unexpected things happen.  Once I got hold of this book I couldn't stop reading it.  If you read the first books you have to read this one because the conclusion is amazing and sweet.  The ending is soo good!
1559408898|5.0|For me, this is the definitive version of the movie. Criterion haven't really filled the disc with features, but they are adequate. Less is more. <br />We all know about the story, this movie has many underlying plots. The main factor for me is Murphy's personal revenge mission, but essentially this movie is all about one man who had his humanity taken away from him, and starts a quest to get it back.<br />A classic movie, Verhoevens best and the uncut scenes may seem savage and brutal to some but i feel they enhance the story even further. The whole idea behind Murphy's death scene was to create as much sympathy for his character as possible, no matter how brutal the scene was. We live in an age where the bad guys are often cheered as the good guys, but after Murphy's grim demise you almost find yourself cheering when Clarence Boddicker [and his gang] get their just desserts. Murphy's death scene also has a very christian undertone to it. When he is being shot to death he is kneeling with his one remaining arm out to the side, as if he is being crucified. He is also resurrected like Jesus in the bible. <br />I give the film 5/5 as it is a classic<br />The features 3/5, there are not many but what features the disc has are adequate.
0786915749|5.0|I first read this book 10yrs ago and have re-read it since along with the restof the dragonlance books. But the first 3 books of the series is my favorite. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman are the best fantasy writers today. The Story is of the Companions and them trying to stop the Queen of Darkness from ruleing all Krynn. Each of the characters is interesting to read about. My Favorite is Raistlin, then Tas, Then Tanis. All in all the dragonlance books is a great series of books to read.

0767817478|4.0|Well, call me crazy, but I always like this movie for some reason.  Maybe it's the cool new CGI Godzilla, or its the crazy Apache helicopter chase scenes through the concrete jungle which causes more damage than the creature itself does.  Like taking the top off of the Chrysler Building with 2 Sidewinder missiles that miss the beast as it ducks away from them.<br />Being made in 1997(8), I found one line in the film quite ironic.  I think it was the boss at the news office that said that the initial Godzilla attack on NYC was the worst attack since the WTC bombing (of 1993!).  Little would they know, now would they?<br />Now as for the DVD features, the sound is very loud.  Lots of bass even on my little 80W SRS stereo.  The aforementioned helicopter chase scene is really engaging.  The picture quality is top notch also.  Setting your DVD player and TV to 16:9 mode, you get a really clear picture.  (Anamorphic mode).<br />Well anyway, I've only looked through the trailers, I haven't checked out the couple other special features yet.
0767802659|5.0|It's incredible that Hollywood let Verhoeven make this subversive masterpiece. On the surface this film is about a future war, but in reality it is a critique of nationalism and fascism. Heinlein is spinning in his grave like a top, and Verhoeven planned it that way, drawing directly from WWII Hollywood films and Nazi epics such as 'Triumph of the Will'.<br />The underlying truth of this film is that the humans are the aggressors, not the bugs. If you pay attention, the movie even mentions that the first human colonies in the Arachnid Quarantine Zone were by crazy Mormon separatists i.e. the humans invaded the bug planets first.<br />Another oft cited criticism revolves around the asteroids that the bugs are allegedly directing towards Earth. The movie spells this out clearly too - Klendathu is shown as being many lights years away on the opposite side of the galaxy. How exactly are the bugs getting asteroids all the way to Earth? It's called propaganda folks, and the Buenos Aires 'asteroid attack' sequence is a classic. How, for example, does the government news channel have a rolling body count in the millions only minutes after the attack occurs? If you watch this movie a couple of times, you begin to see the signposts that the moviemakers left in plain sight.<br />Other criticism falls into the same area. Why is the military intelligence (in their SS uniforms) so bad and the military weapons so useless against the bugs? Why does Buenos Aires look like an American city full of beautiful Americans? How does Jonny Rico make it through the first attack alive when we see him apparently killed by bugs? These are not just accidents but instead are subtle satire and propaganda.<br />In the post 9/11 era, it is interesting to compare the words of the Sky Marshall (for example) to various world leaders. Substitute 'bugs' for 'terrorists' and there is little difference. The hyper patriotic graphics of the movie's Federal Network are only a few steps removed from cable newsnetworks like Fox.<br />Verhoevens ideas come through on the DVD directors commentary, and he has also discussed them in interviews.  It's unfortunate that so many American viewers see this movie as just a violent sci-fi flick with weak acting by attractive young people, or a failed adaption of a dated pseudo-fascist novel. European reviewers seem to understand it a little better. In retrospect, I guess that is why Verhoeven felt the movie had to be made. I think it achieves the goal admirably.
B000002KDW|4.0|The only thing lacking with the Small Faces songs was they didn't go long enough! That is rectified here as the 'Faces' dish out a fine collection of hard rocking tracks  featuring a pounding rhythm section, funky keyboards, tasty guitar licks and Rod Stewart in fine voice.
B000005H40|5.0|Mention the name \\" Coltrane \\" in Jazz circles and you're bound to receive a response whose admiration borders on an almost religious style worship. Other than Miles there's simply no one in this remarkable field of Music that has obtained such an incredibly strong, passionate and loyal following as that of John Coltrane. While long considered to be the intellectuals ( I dislike that word but.... ) 'favorite son' in a style of music that is chock-full of 'thinking' musicians Coltrane simply possess a unique position, where virtually he alone resides, all the while composing music that eventually would lead him on a quest where his soulful playing obtained an artistic level that was not only incredibly personal but certainly sought a deeply spiritual meaning as well. And while I won't pretend to understand the almost religious fervor that some friends have for this artist I will state that I do have a great deal of respect for John Coltrane....for the man and the musician as well. And listening to \\" Blue Train \\" might help explain why this tenor saxophonist is regarded in such high esteem. <br />While long being regarded a 'searching' musician, Coltrane and bandmates recorded \\" Blue Train \\", his only Blue Note release, on Sept. 15, 1957. Obviously being well-rehearsed, the title track, an eerie blues selection, is Lee Morgan's real chance to shine. After the intial melody Lee's trumpet makes an energetic statement, followed closely by Curtis Fuller on trombone, and everything here runs extremely 'Hot and Cool'. Plus after 10 odd minutes the listener may be already exhausted, to say nothing of in awe of this bands performance. Following up with \\" Moment's Notice \\", my personal favorite, another fast-paced tune with solo's by Coltrane, Fuller, Morgan and even a bowed bass performance by Paul Chambers, and you'll be amazed at how 'happy' even Coltrane can sound when composing. The ballad \\" I'm Old-Fashioned \\", the only selection not written by him, is a perenial favoriteas well, played softly and gently it's a wonderful contrast to the energetic playing that fills up the rest of this remarkable cd. But than again.... I've always been preferential to Ballads anyway! Closing with \\" Lazy Bird \\" with a wonderful piano intro by Kenny Drew, and following with solos by Coltrane, Fuller and Paul Chambers ( again using the bow ) and with Lee Morgan ending this track while Coltrane and Curtis ride out the theme. Even I, with my 'tin ear' understood after my very first listen that what I was hearing was a disc filled with songs that were performed by musicians who were not only ultimately honest about their music but incredibly passionate as well. And while I wasn't ready to 'bow to the alter of Coltrane' just yet I was completely enthralled by my purchase. <br />All in all \\" Blue Train \\" is remarkable in the sense that while the music being performed here is extremely free in it's origins it never lose's that sense of control that many jazz cd's, at least for me, seem to be guilty of when letting musicians endlessly 'wander' when soloing. Everything here, individually and collectively, works simply due to the players musical maturity in relating with one another and in each participant understanding his part in these wonderful tracks. And while it's true that in later years Coltrane took his music to a level where I could not join him ( I'm still trying to get through 'A Love Supreme'! ) I do have this incredible disc, plus ' Ballads \\" and \\" Giant Steps \\" to remember not only a quintessential musician but also a man who sought truth and guidance through his music. At hindsight, perhaps my friend's adoration of this inspired tenor saxophonist aren't so completely misguided after all.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is excellent (as you can probably tell from the title) with great musical performances and vocals from the band throughout. I'm going to give a quick run-through of each song on the album:<BR>Prison Song- Starting with a stop-start riff & serj whispering before turning into a fast paced, political song and breaking down into a tranquil, melodic moment and back to fast paced riffing with daron and serj screaming on the chorus.<br />Needles- Frenetic stop-start riffing with drums dominating on the verse and excellent drumming during the chorus from john dalmayan with serj & daron giving it their all on vocals during the chorus and melodic breakdown<br />Deer Dance- Kick starts with a heavy riff before turning quieter with serj giving typically strange vocals during the verses and chorus before melodic vocals escalate to manic vocals and the fast paced, heavy chorus.<br />Jet Pilot- Carries on the pace of 'Deer Dance' at the start and during the chorus although has quieter verses with serj's singing sounding very ethnic during these.<br />X- Crazy, fast thrash riffs throughout this short song with serj singing very melodically in parts.<br />Chop Suey- The first single has a very strong drum beat and bassline with guitar both thrashy & strange sounding at times and has typically excellent vocals with a sing along chorus.<br />Bounce- The strangest song on the whole album featuring mostly thrash guitars and absolutely mad vocals from both serj and daron <br />Forest- My favourite song on the whole album, great vocals, probably the best chorus and vocals on the album and great playing of the instruments throughout. Too good to justify in words.<br />ATWA- Inspired by Charles Manson this song starts with a very quiet guitar and soothing vocals with a heavier chorus and angry sounded vocals from serj and great back-up vocals from daron.<br />Science- Starts with a riff reminicsent of old school metal before descending into thrash with shouty vocals from serj anda brilliant chorus with brief melodic respite featuring strange vocals and sounds and then back to thrash and the chorus<br />Shimmy- Brilliant, frantic, shouty vocals during this typically stop-start short song.<br />Toxicity- The second single with absolutley amazing drumming fron john and whispery vocals in the verse and shouty vocals in the chorus, great song with the video directed by shavo odadjian.<br />Pyscho- A song about groupies \\"Pyshco, Groupie, Cocaine Crazy\\" with a thrashy verse & tranquil chorus with great playing and vocals coming, rarely, entirely from serj. It also features a solo at the end reminiscent of 'Use Your Illusion' era G'N'R believe it or not.<br />Aerials- Great closing song which although thrashy in parts is not as fast as the other songs and has an epic feel to it features melodic vocals coming almost jointly from serj & daron.<br />Arto- Secret song following on straight after 'Aerials' features strange tribal instruments and chanting.
B00004XOWN|5.0|Lots of people say that LB has sold out with this album but just because their music has changed a little bit, it does not give anyone the right to say they sold out. LB is the best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be...(no pun intended)<br />2) Hot Dog- This song has a great melody especially the part where Fred says\\" BRING IT ON! but I think the cursing has ruined it a little.<br />3) My Generation- Perhaps one of my favorite songs on the album. I like the song better when I watch the music video with it. Great hype in this song!<br />4) Full Nelson- A very cool song with probably the best chorus on this album. It should've been one of their singles but I still like all the songs that became singles from this album. I like what DJ Lethal does at the end of this song.<br />5) My Way- DJ Lethal has done great with this song and if you're a LB fan, this is something worth listening to.<br />6) Rollin' (air raid vehicle)- A great song to rock out to but you kinda get sick of this song if you listen to it too much.<br />7) Livin' It Up- This is Limp Bizkit's most creative song with the great lyrics such as \\"Mrs. Aguilera, come and get some!!!\\" I could imagine a lot of possibilities if this were to become a music video.<br />8) The One- If you like the softer side of Limp Bizkit but you still want a touch of rock, this is the song for you. This song is ok but it's not my kinda style of music.<br />9) Getcha Groove On- I'm not a rap fan so I would skip this song.<br />10) Take A Look Around- Far by the most recognizable song if you've watched M:1-2 or heard it so many times on K-ROQ. Ex-Guitarist, Wes Borland has produced great guitars riffs for this song.<br />11) It'll Be Ok- I thought this song was my favorite but you realize there are better songs on the album so you eventually move on. Still a great song!<br />12) Boiler- Probably the coolest song on the album. It's got the classic hard rock style that makes it all the better. It's sort of a heavier and more emotional version of \\"Re-Arranged.\\"<br />13) Hold On- Too slow for me. Need to pick up the pace!<br />14) Rollin' (urban assault vehicle)- As I've said before, I'm not a rap fan, so I would probably head back on to \\"Boiler\\" and listen to it like 10 times.<br />Well, I hope my review was interesting enough for you people.<br />P.S. Don't diss Wes Borland because even though he ditched the band, he is probably one of the coolest musicians in the world and I wish him great luck with his new band, \\"Eat The Day.\\" <br />Props to Fred Durst, John Otto, Wes Borland, Sam Rivers and DJ Lethal for making this awesome record!
0066620996|5.0|This book is honest, thorough, and practical in its presentation of data from research. Some may argue about how precise it is, statistically. The author is trying to impart anecdotal and empirical support for leadership successes, not prove that they are statistically and mathematically perfect. The book is loaded with good information for all who are interested in leadership to follow. Additional information and knowledge that I, as a consultant, would recommend reading in order to attain a complete understanding of leadership (outside the scope of &quot;Good to Great&quot;), is a simply written book I recommend to my clients called, &quot;West Point&quot;, by Norman Thomas Remick. I give some clients a copy of James C. Collins' &quot;Good to Great&quot; and clients in other fields different ones. To all, however, I recommend getting that book on the basic philosophical principles that underpin leadership in order to fully understand leadership, and effectively be a good leader.
B00003CWL6|1.0|Of course this review will be the small voice of dissent in a sea of praise, but I'm writing for the few who will listen. Okay so this movie was making a statement about what is wrong with America today, it's supposed to deal with the superficiality of the American suburbs, the hypocrisy of family today, blah blah blah. You get all of that within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of it is all rose petals falling and an excuse pass off nudity as \\"art\\". At no point in this movie was it necessary to for us to see Mena Suvari's breasts. They were totally completely superfluous to the movie. But, hey, this movie is an \\"artistic masterpiece\\" so, therefore some nudity is required. Every single scene in this movie was the director screaming from the rooftops: \\"look at me, I'm making an artistic movie and since many of us aspire to be 'intellectual', i.e. pretentious, we'll praise it because it's 'different' \\". What was the point of this movie? Was he trying to get across a message that something is wrong with American society today? If so, he could have done it without Mena Suvari's breasts, the rose petals, and of course the most \\"beautiful scene in the whole movie\\" - I refer of course that oh-so-profound scene where the the marijuana-peddling voyeur neighbour says that the plastic bag flowing in the wind was so beautiful. Gosh, that statement had me almost emptying my stomach in the wrong way. Ok, I'll admit that at certain points in the movie, I had to laugh out loud, there was definitely some good humour, but most of this movie, was a useless, senseless, pretentious waste of film. So the director wanted to make the statement that something was wrong with society today. Tell me something I don't know. Look for the beauty in everyday life? Sure, but it wasn't anywhere in the movie. Compare this to another movie which wanted to bring home the tragedy of the twisted world we live in - Life is Beautiful. The director of that movie didn't need to show breasts, didn'teven need to use curse words and what little violence there was was implied. Yet it brings home to all of us, how cruel and beautiful and complex human beings are. Another good movie which released around the same time - Fight Club. Also a very brilliantly done movie. The best way to get a social message across is subtlety. This movie was as subtle as sledgehammer. All this movie does is take the worst possible in all of us and put it onscreen. Either way, there was no reason for anybody to see Mena Suvari's breasts. Of course this review will just be voted least helpful, but hey, somebody had to be brave enough to criticize this movie.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Time doesn't seem to affect Journey in this new DVD, recorded on New Year's Eve 2000/2001 in Las Vegas.  Returning to the lineup are long-time members Jonathan Cain (keys), and founding bassist and guitarist--Ross Valory and Neal Schon, respectively. New to the band are drummer Deen Castronovo (of Steve Vai, Ozzy, Tony MacAlpine and Marty Friedman fame) and new to the arena rock profession, vocalist Steve Augeri. <BR>Many unjustly refer to Augeri as \\"Steve Perry with a perm\\", which is ludicrous. He does nothing but justice to the classic Journey songs in this concert, while giving everything his own flair and artistic influences. Playing two songs from their latest studio album, \\"Arrival\\", Augeri shows what he's really got and that he's not just a Perry-clone. <BR>All in all, every member is in fine form (especially Valory, who's just as much of a monster bassist as ever). Everything from the thick and lush choruses to the solos and drum fills sounds better than ever--as if given a new breath of life. Highlights include the elongated version of \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\", and the rare RARE playing of La Raza Del Sol, a Santana-influenced samba rock tune only released on their \\"Time3\\" box set. Fantastic instrumentality!<BR>So, before I linger on anymore: bring this one home, crank up the speakers, and just let it all rock like there's no tomrrow! The Journey carries on!
B00005OWEG|2.0|I looked forward to this release so I could experience again the thrill I got from not only watching a great movie but also hearing the terrific score led by the inimitable vocals of Jim Morrison and the Doors. What a disappointment! The additional scenes did nothing: how ridiculous is that \\"French\\" scene!!! As to how they \\"butchered\\" Jim's rendition of \\"The End\\" during the finale is just criminal! Give me back the thrill of the original: it was far more cogent and powerful; this new one is a Tosser's version!
B00005UEAR|4.0|With every their release, Dream Theater keeps raising the bar for the level of musical excellence for prog-rock bands to achieve.  This time, they released an awe-inspiring album that takes their music to a new level, with influences from many mainstread sub-genres of rock music.  It seems that DT takes music from bands ranging from Pantera to Radiohead to Tool, and puts their trademark on it, coming up with something quite original.  The band's willingness to evolve is always appreciated.<br />The second disk contains a 42-minute long number broken into 8 tracks (unlike A Change of Seasons, which was all on one track), and this epic song is reminiscent of old-school Dream Theater.  Keyboardist Jordan Rudess has done much for the band in terms of musical composition, and his arrangements are incredible.  We also get to hear Mike Portnoy play some jazz drums - something that he doesn't do very often.  Guitarist John Petrucci shines with soaring solos, growling riffs, and some sweet acoustic playing; in my opinion, Petrucci is at his best on this release.<br />The vocal styling is very DT-like: most of the vocals are fairly melodic, as they have always been in the past.  But although you won't hear any reggae or hip-hop influence in the vocals on this album, there are plenty of innovative effects that vocalist James LaBrie adds to his repertoire.  Musically, his performance is probably the biggest step away from what the band had done in the past.<br />There are also a few disappointments.  First off, although the songs on the first CD are fairly long, there are still only five of them, and the CD seems very short, especially for a Dream Theater release.  Secondly, the title track, taking up the second CD, has a theme that doesn't very well match up with the music.  It talks about mental disorders, but the music is very major key and easy going.  Also, the lyrics themselves are not always up to par; some parts are great, others not so much.<br />Misunderstood is a beautiful piece, my favorite track on the CD, and possibly my favorite Dream Theater song.  It's destined to get some radio attention somewhere in the world, I'm sure of it.  This one song is probably worth the cost of the CD all together.  Bottom line: BUY THIS!
B00000ILDE|5.0|15 years later, I am amazed that this movie STILL gets my heart racing and makes me want to sleep with the closet light on! I saw this at the theater when it first came out, and dozens of times since either on edited TV or VHS. The DVD edition is great! Not only is the sound and picture quality superior, but the previously deleted scenes fill in a few blanks that go unanswered in the original (I won't reveal for those who haven't watched this version). You don't have to be a &quot;horror&quot; movie fan to appreciate this DVD!
B000005H4K|5.0|Two masters of swing Mingus and Ellington! Plus Max Roach!  Like the reviewer before me said, if you have come this far you already know enough about Jazz to know that this is a real treat. The sound quality on this recording is very very good. I have never heard Mingus's bass recorded so well, and so clear before, (and Ive heard a lot of Mingus)  Ellington's playing is very delicate and subtle on some tracks, and on others he is rockn' so hard it sounds like Rock n'Role. Max Roach's drumming is not to be overlooked. He keeps the two Swing giants inline.  You can tell they had a lot of fun making this record!<br />On a review before mine someone said that Mingus ruined the recording date, and that his playing was sloppy.  I beg-to-differ, Mingus makes this recording. If you were to replace Mingus on bass with Paul Chambers or Garrison, or whoever, this CD would loose what it was that made it so enjoyable and such a standout record. Lots of energy, passion, attack and drive!

0671027344|5.0|This book is considerabley one of the best books I have ever read. If you are a teen it reaches inside you and pulls out everything you ever shared feeling with this author. If you are an adult, it takes you back to when you felt this way, and you remember it.<BR>When my friend finished this book, she handed it to me and smiled and said \\"I think you'll like it.\\" That's all she said to me. The second it touched my hands I wanted to read it, but I had to go to class. So I put it into my backpack and soon forgot that it was in there. That night, I took it out, and read almost the whole book. It was 2 AM when I finally quit reading. In the few hours I read, I had cried, laughed, and cried again. Then I read the few remaining pages at school and let the tears drop on my desk. I really felt what he was writing, I really wanted to give Charlie a hug. It was wonderful reading about this gentle boy who feels out of place and then finds the right friends to lead him through the trials and tribulations of a freshman's first year in high school; dealing with people, sexuality, drugs, crushes, parties... you name it, it's in here. I want to thank Stephen Chbosky for writing a truly unique book.

B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater isn't a just a rock band, they are almost a genre in and of themselves. They answer the question, \\"What would happen if you put five of the best musicians in the world together for 10 years?\\"<br />In a nutshell, this album was exactly what Dream Theater had to do as a follow-up to 1999's 'Scenes From A Memory'. The album was a masterpiece - How do you top that? <br />'Six Degrees' has so much diversity and color that it is difficult to find the words. From very hard rocking songs that would get a Tool fan banging his head (`The Glass Prison', 'The Great Debate'), to very melodic ballads (`Goodbye Kiss'), to one of the saddest songs I have ever heard (`Disappear'), Dream Theater continues to amaze.<br />I could go on and on, but just get the CD. I'll be buying two copies of this one; one for the car and one for the house.  <br />Incredible stuff, DT! Keep it coming!

B0000025KI|3.0|\\"The River\\" represents one of the most confounding success stories in rock history. It is a noisy, unfocused, self-conscious and over-ambitious collection. Upon the release of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall,\\" some critics noted that, for a double album, there should have been a few more compelling tracks. Of course, with an album as good as \\"The Wall,\\" that is arguable. However, the observation is a good one. The songs ought to make the necessity of a double album clear: perhaps the sessions from which they originated were unusually powerful and cohesive, or, as in Floyd's case, the album's length facilitates a narrative of considerable extent. The third, and far more destructive, is that the artist feels the need (or pressure), to prove something. This has lead to some of the most resounding rock failures: Fleetwood Mac's \\"Tusk\\" or Bob Dylan's \\"Live at Budokan,\\" for instance(See Led Zepplin's outstanding \\"Physical Graffiti\\" for a double album tutorial). A double album presents the artist with that age-old challenge to walk the walk if you can talk the talk. Sadly, many double albums are just a lot of talk, \\"The River\\" included.<br />Here, a young and proud Bruce Springsteen wanted to flaunt his versatility, but what we get is a clanging bag of assorted bottles and cans. It is true, Springsteen CAN rock and croon at will, he CAN write the instantly addictive pop ditty (Hungry Heart) and the courageously spare folk tune (The River). The problem is that here, it is all too self-conscious and forced. \\"The River\\" was, apparently, Springsteen's effort to prove his musical plasticity, but the truth is, he had nothing to prove, especially after the riveting \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" Springsteen's most authentic album. The one song on \\"The River\\" that approaches the genius of \\"Darkness . . .\\" is, of course, the title track, which is obscured in a wild sea of noisy, unfocused and unfortunately playful rock. With such achievements as the simultaneously melodic and gritty \\"Murder Incorporated\\" and \\"Human Touch\\" adorning his catalog, \\"The River\\" rings totally hollow, displaying more immaturity than ability. The rock songs here never complete any kind of harmony, rhythm or turn of lyrical wit, and with the exception of the title track, attempts at folkish story-telling are blander than the most uninspired moments on \\"Ghost of Tom Joad.\\"<br />\\"The River\\" is the work of a monumental talent who lost sight of his muse for a moment, returning later with the thoroughly rewarding folk album, \\"Nebraska\\" and later works that combined musical intensity with great writing on \\"Born in the USA\\" and \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" his best album since \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\" Springsteen's \\"Lucky Town\\" and \\"Human Touch\\" were, for the most part, panned as bland and routine, two adjectives that suit \\"The River\\" rather aptly.

B00005QZ7U|2.0|I know I'm going to get hate mail for this review. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is just one of those movies. Everybody just adores it, and you're stuck there thinking &quot;what?&quot; Sure, I could see where everybody's coming from. Love story, good production values, pop songs, and all that jazz. But &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a movie that is as easy to despise as it is to love. <br />The premise is simple. Take a whole bunch of pop music, plop it in the middle of a turn-of-the-century atmosphere and stick in a love story. Some would say such simple words wouldn't be enough to describe this film, but really, that's all it is. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; seems more like a reason for a soundtrack than a film. <br />Ewan McGregor is Christian, an aspiring poet traveling to France for inspiration. Little does he know, inspiration will without a doubt come his way soon, in the form of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a popular courtesan working in the Moulin Rouge. He instantly falls in love, but of course, he can't live happily ever after with her (&quot;The only way of lovin' me, baby, is to pay a lovely fee!&quot;) And Satine has other plans for her future than spending it with Christian, and as her dreams to become an actress start to turn into reality, the greedy Duke of Monroth tries to bind her exclusively to him. So, take this, throw in &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and more, and what do you get? A ludicrous fiasco that's not even fun enough to be a sequel to &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (yes, that IS a movie...) <br />For a while in the beginning, the film is a joy to watch. But this lasts only a few minutes, for as the story starts to develop, the film stops having fun with itself and begins to set up a serious, dramatic mood. That would work if this was any other movie. But in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, the utter ridiculousness of the placement of pop songs undermines anything notable. In the first scenes, I smiled whenChristian randomly blurts out &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;. Very quickly, however, I was getting tired of all the oo-la-la. By the time Zidler (Jim Broadbent) is singing &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, I was laughing at them, not with them. And don't even mention the ill-timed musical number set to &quot;Roxanne&quot;. <br />I have to admit though, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman certainly do have the pipes to carry out the job. They sing with passion (the same can't be said about a certain Mariah Carey) and truly bring out some spirit in the middle of all the chaos. It's too bad the film is such a pain, because they give performances worthy of recognition. The rest of the cast seems like they're having a good time, which does make the film slide along a little easier. <br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; starts with an idea that something could be done with. However, director Baz Luhrmann sells-out completely, completely giving his movie up for commercial success. There is really little inspiration after the first shots, and the premise might be able to sustain for two hours if the way it was carried out wasn't so gag-inducing. Quick note to Mr. Luhrmann: it's a very bad sign when you're is laughing so hard during dramatic moments that at the end, your friend turns to you and suggests you leave &quot;before the people in the back start shooting&quot;.
B00005U1YO|5.0|I love Prodigy, Crystal Method, and Chemical Brothers, and their latest CD did not disappoint at all.  It's really kind of hard for me to describe what it sounds like--it's more like you have to hear it for yourself.  Yes, there will always be those who say it's repetive or boring or whatever, but in my opinion it's an amazing album with catchy beats and nice bass lines. It's too bad the real audio samples amazon provides are so short, because for this kind of music it just doesn't work AT ALL.  Most of the brothers' songs take a minute or two before they come out full force, before the real sweet beats kick in.  So if you're going to listen to just those samples, and decide whether or not to buy the album based solely on what those 10 or 15 seconds of the beginning of each song sound like, I'd say definitely give it a real try--download some mp3s online or borrow the CD from a friend.  Also, if you like any of the aforementioned artists, I'd recommend you SERIOUSLY consider buying \\"Come With Us\\".
B000025RAY|5.0|\\"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\\"<BR>A haunting, sordid, beautiful film. <BR>I'm young enough so that the Jack Nicholson I grew up with was from \\"The Shining\\" onward. I always admired his charisma, but it wasn't until I watched this film that I grasped what an amazingly subtle and powerful actor he actually was in his prime. He takes a role Bogart would have been proud to play and in some ways redefines the role.<BR>The rest of the cast also rises to the occasion, the script is crisp, hard-boiled and full of memorable lines. Polanski shows us pre-war LA through a jaundiced lens; an uncompromising, rough world where such things as truth, compassion and hope can be ground into dust by power and corruption.<BR>Not to be overlooked by any means is the movie's evocative and memorable score, which sets the perfect tone of film noir at the beginning, and adds unforgettable impact to the movie's tragic ending.<BR>A must for any home collection.
0553801481|5.0|After picking up the first of her books, Assassin's Apprentice in a box at a flee market I knew I had to read all of her books. I fell in love with all her characters but in Fool's Errand my favorite would have to be the cats. This book made me laugh, cry, and made me want to throw it across the room because of how mad it made me...if a book can do that then it is truely a master piece! I advise anyone who likes a good fantasy book to read not only a fools errand but all of Robin Hobb's books.
0140189378|5.0|This could be described as the archetypical story of mid-life, middle-class man who hasn't made it and surely never will. Tommy Wilhelm is down on his luck and combats his misery with the hopeful expectation of something turning up. His father, Dr. Adler, views Tommy as having lacked the ability to persist during the various endeavours in his life. He adheres firmly to his cold logic and refuses to help his son, who is the architect of his own downfall. <BR>Tommy cannot find the mastery of his destiny within himself and therefore looks to others, eminently unsuitable for the impossible task; to Dr.Tamkin (their joint commodities scheme is financed with Tommy's bottom dollars) and to his innerly deadened father who does not want to be disturbed in his old age by his failed over-age son. Dr.Tamkin is a charlatan who bewilderingly produces the odd pearl of wisdom from amongst the rest of his pseudo-scientific debris. He represents the soul without substance, and Dr. Adler the substance without soul.<BR>His estranged wife torments him for his past sins. The wealthy old Mr.Rappaport is pathologically self-centred. No help is forthcoming from his fellow humans.<BR>As a product of Western society, with its tradition in state and religious institutions, benign omnipotent divinity, universal laws, natural justice and so on, Tommy seems to be clinging on to the belief in some kind of metaphysical scheme of things that surely must be out there somewhere to make it all right in the end. The message seems to be that these putative structures and mechanisms of sustenance are non-existent when it comes to the crunch, i.e. you're on your own, Pal!<BR>And then comes the ending.
0446608955|5.0|I was at the bookstore looking for a book and since I'm in to romantic stuff I was looking for a romantic story, well then I saw this single book in the shelve \\"A walk to remember\\" and I looked at the first few pages and I totally liked it. So I decided to buy it, it took me three days to finish it and as I read the last page a last tear drop fell I was so touched by the way Landon Carter narrated the story. It really made me think a lot because love could really end up this way. I didn't even know that this book was going to be a movie, until two weeks later I saw the previews and I could tell already in the previews that a lot was changed in the movie, So until last night I saw the movie and it was awesome I liked it a lot but we all know that the book is always gonna be better than the movie...no doubt.
0385493622|5.0|I can't think of enough reasons to recommend this wonderful book.  Pierre Fermat proposed this deceptively simple problem back in the mid-1600s, yet it eluded the greatest mathematical minds of the ages, including Euler, one of the founders of modern mathematics.  <br />While not shirking in any way on detail regarding the Theorem, number theory, and the immense difficulties in solving it, Singh manages to make this a very human story.  Germain, Galois, Wolfskehl-- these remarkable minds are made flesh-and-blood, and Galois' story in particular is just heart-rending!  We are finally brought to the mind-bending proof of Andrew Wiles in the 1990s, and are able to grasp why the Theorem's solution remained so elusive; as simple as it seems at first glance, it requires the ultimate back-door attack and some of the most advanced, specialized mathematics available to tackle it.  Kudos to Wiles as always for his achievement, and kudos to Singh for his wonderful book discussing it.
B00005RFQ5|2.0|You know you're a fairly devoted Prince fan if you already own this disc.  I bought it on the day of release, as I have since 1989's \\"Batman\\" soundtrack.  I've been a Prince fan since 1984, when I was 9 years old.<br />This seems to be a love it or hate it release which has divided even the most faithful Prince fans.  I have had people accuse me of being 'close-minded' and 'incapable of listening to challenging music' simply because I have expressed negative opinions about this release.  This isn't a coherent album.  There are very few 'songs', in the traditional sense.  There's nothing wrong with structured songs as long as the structure avoids predictability.  This album is definitely not predictable, but it's so indulgent with the voice-over narration and incomprehensible lyrics that it becomes tiresome.<br />Many have tried to argue in defense of the lyrics, claiming that Prince isn't doing anything different than in past religious/spiritual releases such as \\"Lovesexy.\\"  I have no problem with the religious content, but I can't understand what most of these songs are about.  \\"Lovesexy\\" was very clear in it's message, while still quite idiosyncratic.  Maybe I'm just stupid, but these lyrics don't make much sense to me. <br />I will say that the musicianship is a DRASTIC improvement over basically all Prince's releases dating back to the sterile, synthetic-sounding \\"Emancipation.\\"  Rather than having stale, programmed drum beats, John Blackwell provides excellent drumming.  Prince is actually playing guitar and bass, and it sounds good.  I feel it would be getting carried away, however, to say that the musicianship is \\"superb\\" or \\"fantastic\\" or \\"brilliant.\\"  The overall feel to this album is sort of jazzy, light funk.  Compare the funkier tracks to any classic James Brown track from the late-60s or early-70s and they sound anemic.  As far as the jazzier stuff goes... if you think this is brilliant playing, I'd say you need to listen to some great jazz artists (ofany era).  There's certainly no virtuoso playing anywhere on this disc, though when compared to something like \\"New Power Soul\\" its easy to see why so much hyperpole has been thrown at this record by some listeners.<br />Then bottom line for me is this:  the best Prince albums are full of great songs... \\"Purple Rain,\\" \\"Sign o' the times,\\" \\"Lovesexy,\\" \\"Grafitti Bridge,\\" \\"The Gold Experience.\\"  If that makes me conventional, fine.  That's better than being delusional, which is what you'd have to be to consider this a great album.

0780021967|5.0|I have seen the Laserlight version.  While I found it to be fairly acceptable considering the low cost, if you are a Hitchcock fan Criterion is the only way to go.  The Criterion presentation is hard to fault; considering the age of the film, the image is clear and the sound is always intelligible.  Plus I believe the Laserlight version is missing a few minutes, running about 83 minutes as opposed to the 86 minute Criterion.<br />The movie, after all these decades, remains very entertaining.  The humor, particularly, holds up surprisingly well.  This is in large part to a fantastic performance by Robert Donat.  Much has been said about the movie, so rather than reiterate a similar appraisal I'll move on to discuss more reasons why the Criterion version is superior (besides the great picture and audio).<br />There are four main supplements included.  The two best are actually vintage pieces, which is somewhat surprising for a 1935 film.  The 1937 Lux Radio Theatre broadcast is presented in its entirety, including a commercial break and interview with a retired U.S. spy.  This radio adaptation is very entertaining, and also interesting in the ways it compromises for the lack of picture.  It runs for just shy of a full hour.  Criterion was thoughtful enough to include a handful of still photos of the cast members that occasionally show up on-screen as the radio show plays.<br />The second most interesting piece is a text-based feature, and one of the best of its kind that I've seen.  The original pressbook is presented page-by-page.  This in itself is useful if you're at all interested in the evolution of movie promotion, as this pressbook is sort of like a newspaper- very different from the pressbooks of today.  What makes this a great feature is the ability to highlight and enlarge much of the content on each page; you can get a better look at the vintage photos, as well as read the full text of many articles about the film's stars, about Hitchcock, and many anecdotes about the making of the film.<br />Marian Keene, a Hitchcock scholar, provides audio commentary for the length of the feature.  It's not the greatest commentary of all time, but it's very worthwhile.  She talks in detail about the compositions of the shots, explaining why the film was visually groundbreaking for its time.  She also seems to find phallic symbols in most of the scenes.  The downside of her commentary is a tendancy to merely tell us what we're already looking at, or what we're about to look at.  But regardless, I felt my appreciation of the movie was increased after listening. <br />The least useful of the main supplements is an approximately 30 minute documentary that originally aired on TV in the '70s.  Basically it consists of film clips from a variety of late 20s and early 30s Hitchcock film, mixed with a few still photos, and narrated by Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  If you keep in mind that there was no home video in the 1970s, it is easy to see why this program would be valuable for its time.  Most of the public had no way of seeing these old films.  But now that they are widely available, it makes more sense to just watch the films themselves.  In fact, this documentary will spoil the films if you haven't already seen them- many important plot points and twists are revealed.  Still, its a passable overview of Hitchcock's early career.<br />Lastly, there are a handful of stills featuring original production art.  These is actually more valuable than the documentary, since they pertain directly to &quot;The 39 Steps.&quot;<br />Criterion really did a great job with this release.  If you're serious about collecting Hitchcock on DVD, spring for this version.  If you just want to see the movie without dropping thirty bucks, the Laserlight disc isn't the worst thing out there (plus its got one of those great Tony Curtis intros!  I'm not kidding, those intros are the best thing about the bargain-basement Laserlight series.)

B00005TT77|2.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan.  These are great songs.  I have not seen the movie \\"I am Sam.\\"<br />That said, this is unfortunately not a very good collection.  The overall vibe of this album is very gentle.  The Beatles excelled at virtually all styles of rock music.  I don't understand why none of the artists decided to represent the rock'n'roll side of the Beatles.  Everything is so mellow, to the point where uptempo tracks like \\"Help\\" or midtempo like \\"Nowhere Man\\" have been slooooowed doooown.<br />I'm not complaining the that above tracks were reinterpreted.  In fact, I applaud the artists that did re-work the material.  I only wish that more stylistic variety was found here- most everything is acoustic-based folk or ballads.  Most of it lacks energy and punch.<br />THE BEST OF THE BUNCH= BEN HARPER: \\"Strawberry Fields\\"- fairly faithful to the sound of the original, but with a unique vocal that doesn't try to duplicate Lennon's delivery... CHOCOLATE GENIUS: \\"Julia\\"- this is a great piece of work, it sounds virtually nothing like the Beatles version (performed by Lennon solo with acoustic guitar), yet even drastically reworked it maintains the Beatles spirit... THE VINES: \\"I'm only Sleeping\\", faithful the original, but it's got more pep than most tracks here.<br />THE WORST OF THE BUNCH:  RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:  \\"Across the Universe\\", frankly this guy's voice sucks... WALLFLOWERS: \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", this should've been good given the band's talent, but this version resembles what I imagine the Monkees covering the Beatles would sound like (shudder)... PAUL WESTERBURG:  \\"Nowhere Man\\", drags the song to a too-slow tempo with this solo acoustic rendition, drains the song of it's vitality... THE BLACK CROWES \\"Lucy in the Sky...\\", Man, the Crowes covering the Beatles COULD'VE been great (a better choice would've been something bluesy like 'Don't let me down'), but this song doesn't fit their style- rather than try to adapt it, they stick way too close to the original.<br />The ones I didn't mention are okay.  There's really nothing too cringe-worthy here.  Just an overall lack of inspiration.  Covering the Beatles is a tough thing, and most of these people weren't up to the challenge.
B00005QW4K|4.0|This movie is thoroughly enjoyable, with many laugh out loud moments, made even funnier by the fact that it pretends to take itself seriously(it fails in that; try to take it seriously when Bruce tells the knight his shoelaces are untied). I loved every minute of it. DO NOT buy the universal edition of it, that edition has no special features. If you're a huge fan of the original ending, get the standard anchor bay edition. If you want 15 more minutes of AoD, like me, and don't mind having a different ending, get this director's cut edition. P.S. It is not just for horror fans. In fact, it's probably diehard horror freaks that would be MOST insulted by this \\"horror\\" film. It's really a comedy.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Being a fan for about 10 years now, Dream Theater has long been my favorite band.  They never cease to amaze me with each album they release.  This new album is excellent!!!  It is a bit different from their previous albums, being a little heavier and James experiments with his vocal stylings.  John P. and Mike also sing more on this release.  It is awesome and i cant wait to see them play this stuff live.
6302759110|5.0|I own this movie and it is wonderful.  I enjoy literature and movies about vampires, and this is one of the best made movies on vampires.  This movie and Interview with a Vampire are two of my three favorite movies, so I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone interested in vampires.<br />This role is Gary Oldman's best work.  The love between Dracula (Gary Oldman) and Mina Harker (Winona Ryder) is elegantly portrayed throughout the movie.  I find myself wanting to be Mina for all the strong feelings that this movie brings to mind :)  At the end I actually cry, for then love is lost...or is it...
B00004XPQ2|5.0|Though William Holden is given the first billing of the credits, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; is without doubt Alec Guinness's film.  And the film's setting may lead you to think this masterpiece as a &quot;war movie&quot;; that is not exactly true.<br />&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; begins with intense battle of will.  As British Colonel Nicholson (Guinness) refuses to join the work of building a bridge, Japanese Colonel Saito tests his will in the most extreme ways.  But many keen-eyed viewers will soon realize that both have something in common, which finally draws each other after Nicholson's long, long suffering under the hot sun in Southeast Asia.  Ironically, Nicholson finds himself deeply involved in nearly impossible task of building a bridge more than he actually knows.  But to what purpose?<br />As this storyline shows, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; brilliantly works as a fable, and the superb acting of Alec Guinness, whom younger generations probably remember as Obi-Wan of &quot;Star Wars,&quot; will rivet your eyes on the screen.  The cinematograhy is also great, capturing the humid climate of the place to give the film authentic atmosphere.  But most of all, this is made before CGI became popular in moviemaking -- just imagine they had to make all of those production designs!<br />Looking back from now, David Lean's epic-scale story seems to lose its power in the latter half of the film, in which Holden's character tries to destroy the bridge.  His character is a little unconvincing, compared with Guinness and Hayakawa, and Lean, I am afraid, stretched the film too long to depict Holden's deadly mission though his trek in the jungle itself is an engrossing one.  And you may feel Hayakawa'a performance is a little theatrical -- but keep in mind, he first became an instant star in Hollywood in 1915 with &quot;Cheat&quot; (directed by Cecil B. DeMille, another director who preferred big-scale movies).  But don't worry, you soon forget these things.<br />&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; is a masterpiece that only golden age of Hollywood could produce; not flashy special effects but talented actors with dedicated crew made it possible to exist.  Watch it.<br />Pierre Boulle, a French writer who wrote the original book of &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; based on his own experience during the WW2 and his days in prison camp, is also the author of &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot;  The latter book (and the original film, to some extent) is also intelligent and iroical as well as David Lean's masterpiece.  Try it.
0064407667|5.0|I dislike comparing original works to the likes of others,but in an attempt to give you an idea of what these books are like,imagine if you will, Roald Dahl,Richard Sala,and Monty Python all sitting around a table and concieving a series of \\"childrens\\" books.....and you'd have a pretty good idea of what its all about.<br />\\"The Bad Beginning\\",starts off the dismal adventures of the Baudelaire children and their quest to defeat their wicked uncle Count Olaf,and his evil schemes,and numerous minions. It also begins the mystery surrounding Mr.Lemony Snicket,and why he is compelled to write these adventures,and why he is running from the authorities!( Not to mention the mystery surrounding the very dead Beatrice! )<br />Childrens books? Hardly. These are for \\"big kids\\"! Not many children will catch the numerous literary references. (i.e. \\"Baudelaire\\",or \\"Sunny & Klaus\\" ( as in \\"Von Bulow\\" )or \\"Isadora & Duncan Quagmire\\",or Mr.Poe,whom constantly coughs into his handkerchief, and his son Edgar,or Uncle Monty whom owns a collection of snakes,etc. ). Not to mention the series promises 13 books,all with 13 chapters.<br />The plots are comical and silly,and a great distraction for those whom like a good laugh,at the expense of some downtrodden orphans.( And who doesn't? )<br />How can you not be drawn to a book,whos very dust jacket implores you NOT to read it? Like a bad habit with your name on it,once you begin,you'll crave more and more!<br />I recommend this series for anyone with a sense of humour or your favorite goth girl or guy!

0345440803|5.0|Tracy's blend of humor, common sense and most importantly respect, is excellent reading, not only for dealing with Toddlers but for everyone. Certainly opens your eyes to the way we communicate.<br />If you followed Tracy's advice in the Baby Whisperer book, this book is for you. If you didn't read the Baby whisperer book and you are a parent or becoming one get both books. They are Totally packed with real life scenarios, common sense, and sound advice. Tracy's wit definately proves to me that she has been in the trenches as she calls it with these Toddlers, and not something she has conjured up from behind a desk.<br />This book will &quot;and I underline will&quot; guide you through the tantrums of Toddlerhood and will even set the stage for parenting beyond this period. I am totally amazed at the results by just using the H.E.L.P chapter with my 18 month old twins. <br />The seperation anxiety issues are well worth the read, this seems to be frantic time for all parents who are usually not aware of this.<br />All in all a superb read from cover to cover.

B00005NWM3|4.0|Truthfully, i didnt expect it to be a good album at all. I had heard &quot;How U Remind me&quot; on the radio quite a few times, and liked the song. But, i didnt think i'd like the album. But, i did. <br />The first track &quot;Never Again&quot; blew me away with the lyrics. I couldnt stop listening to it. Next came How U Remind Me, but i skipped over it to hear what came next. The Fourth Track &quot;Too bad&quot; caught my attention, and i listened carefully. <br />Most of the tracks i ended up skipping over the first time, to get the feel of the music. Track 5 got my attention with the opening. I found it entertaining to hear the whole 'I want to rip his heart out' thing. <br />Ok, so i didnt like the WHOLE album. Sure, a couple songs could have been left out. But overall, i appreciated it. Sure, its not as good as Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory, or even P.O.D.'s Satellite, but i think it fits right in with Creed's Weathered, which has some pretty kewl songs, too. the two bands may sound a bit alike, but their lyrics are the complete opposite. Listen to Never Again from Nickelback and My Sacrifice and you'll see the difference.
B00005TT77|4.0|I am not a beatles fan.   In fact, I have disturbing memories from my childhood, falling asleep with the radio on, only to be awakened by the Beatles singing Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.  This album, however, contains the only Beatles songs I ever did like.  We (my teenage kids and I) especially like the remade versions Blackbird (though I must admit I like the original, too) and Strawberry Fields.  We love Rufus Wrainwright and Ben Folds.  I am no music critic, no expert.  I just like this CD a lot.
B000001G16|5.0|I was introduced to this album by my brother. I soon bought my own copy. This album is in my opinion a clear departure from the &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; formula. What grabs you immediately is the vocals. Richie has an awesome range and power behind the mic. For being an album done by a guitarist, it's not really guitar oriented it's more a musical statement and the arrangements have a great deal of sophistication. I've played this album for other musician and non-musician friends of mine and they've all agreed that Richie has some great vocal chops. I had a hard time getting the cd back a few times. Least favorite songs were Rosie and River of Love. Favorites:The Answer, Father Time, Intro+ Church of Desire and Mr.Bluesman. This is a must have CD.
B00003CWL5|5.0|American beauty, how can I really talk about this movie? I've seen it many times and it  really stands out to me as showing some normal people with a slight twist to them. It's not your typical movie, but that's good. The cinematography and Kevin Spacey really make this movie classic.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|An impressive return 2 form 4 one of the most influential artists of the past 20 years. Musically this is as good as it gets, gone are Princes experimentations with different modern forms of music & this is back 2 basics jazz/funk with undertones of very early Prince!<BR>   Thoroughly recommended 2 any Prince admirer old or new, sit back, dim the lights & get lost in the music! 100%.
B00000JZIK|5.0|The Usual Suspects is one of those movies that you have to see atleast twice. A lot of information is packed into this movie and everytime you watch it, you notice something new making the viewing experience great. You can't really get tired of this movie.
B00005221M|5.0|I am a huge fan of this movie and have watched it dozens of times. Since getting the DVD, I've watched it all the way through once and watched a few of the scenes a few more times. I know that some lines were deleted, but I was pretty happy with the scenes that were added including:<br />1) Added scene at the fort now shows the \\"diversion\\" that Munro says that Heyward will create. I always wanted to know what the heck he was talking about.<br />2) Added scene in Albany in Webb's office shows how justified the settlers were in fearing for their families and property from the very beginning.<br />3) Added shots during the march after the surrender and just before the massacare seem to show how very close the British were to the fort when they were attacked. In the original cut, it seemed to me like they were a long way from the fort. Knowing (or at least thinking) that they were that close to the fort puts Magua's conversation with Montcalm in a little different light. They may have added some dialogue in that scene too, but I'm not sure. Either way, it now seems much more clear that Montcalm knew exactly what Magua was going to do and in fact asks for it indirectly.<br />4) In general, there are a bunch of little 2-3 second clips here and there that to me make all the distances in the movie much shorter, whether it be the distance from the fort to the mortars, fort to albany, fort to massacare, village to cliff, etc. Flow-wise, they aren't NECESSARY to the plot, but I think that they help us relate to the fact that these people are walking everywhere and they can only travel may 10-15 miles in a day while we travel at more than a mile a minute in our cars. Webb was just a few miles away; the French were just a good 5-iron shot away from the fort with their mortars: etc.<br />Perhaps I was just too excited to see some new scenes after 10 years, but I think at least some of them DO make a positive difference.
B00003CXE6|5.0|I was unsure about seeing gladiator in the theateres when it came out but one of my friends convinced me to go with him. I was not disappointed. Gladiator really shows how well Ridley Scott can direct and how well Russell Crowe can act. It's really easy to feel attached to the lift of this gladiator and what he has to go through after becoming a slave.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Of GLADIATOR it suffices to say that it is magnificient and a wonderful return to grand cinema making of olden days. Of Connie Nielsen, however, it must be said and emphasized that she is the true gem of the film. Understated acting and a finely drawn female character whose dilemma is truly touching and engaging. Nielsen is the perfect choice for the role. Gorgeous and so far from the assembly line beauty of American female talent. Nielsen is totally stunning. Shame on the Academy for bypassing this superb performance, this unique artist.
B000000W3G|5.0|Airplane flies high is something good for the diehard smashing pumpkins fans. There are plenty of great unreleased songs like mouth of babes and ugly as well as covers like destination unknown. It's really good to complete a die-hards smashing pumpkins collection.
B00005JKHP|4.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL DVD presentation by Robert Wise of his director's Cut.<BR>Too much is made about previous versions supplementing more character scenes or deleting them.<BR>This is a a unique film all onto itself that play's out a familiar theme of tecnology and man from the series, however cast and crew created a visually stunning production for it's time and with the few CGI enhancement's this dvd look's better than the movie ever has.<BR>I don't see why comparison's are made with the sequel's unfavourably to their progenator.<BR>Like it or not Star Trek The Motion Picture is simply to be enjoyed and marveled as science-fiction entertainment.<BR>Plenty of dvd extra's featured that go behind-the-scenes of how a revival-tv series became The motion Picture and fascinating production chaos that ensued to bring some ungrateful Trek fan's the Christmas 79' present.<BR>live long and prosper, everyone.
B000000W6R|4.0|Pisces Iscariot is a pretty good collection of unreleased smashing pumpkins material. Since the music was unreleased, it doesn't really show the band at it's prime but the album is still worth listening to.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This was a horrendous movie.  Unfocused and cacophonous.  The director's vision should have remained just that...a vision.  I watched the first ten minutes and I had to turn it off.  To get this movie out of my head, I may have to rent any collaboration by the Sheen-Estevez brothers.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.  Better yet, have somebody else rent it.
0790738139|5.0|L.A. confidential is one of my favorit movies. It's one of my favorite performances my Kevin Spacey. It's a good mystery that keeps you entraged to see what happends next through a series of great performances and entriging story.
B000002UB6|5.0|&quot;Let It Be&quot;. The title alone is good advice for this album. So it's not one of the Beatles essential masterpieces. This is still a must for a genuine fan, especially those of the late period, even if it's not a first buy. Forgive the comparison, but to me this is a unique chance to see the band in raw, unpolished form, much as &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; was for Dylan. This is not Beatles to knock you over in amazement. They made plenty of albums for that purpose. This is just great to relax to in a bluesy, loungy way. The band is at their most human and intimate...at certain moments you feel they are just playing in your garage and having a good time. That's the &quot;divine statement&quot; of this Beatles album: don't forget to truly enjoy your life and all the little things that make it worthwhile. For me, such a statement in music is just as relevant.
B000002LQR|5.0|I've been listening to Blood Sugare Sex Magik for a while now and the album has yet to get old. Songs like under the bridge, breaking the girl, and funky monks are really great. More then a decade after its release, it's obvious that the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are definetely one of the best bands of the 1990s.
B000003TA4|5.0|A brilliant piece of pop containing the dead on anthem of a new set of youngins. Not worth sticking a shotgun in your mouth for, though. In fact, nothing is. Just say no.
B000000W6F|4.0|Gish has some good songs like I am One and Siva but the album isn't exactly brilliant. Later albums like Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness show what the band is really all about.
B000001FHV|1.0|This band has not clicked with me yet. Ive tried twice, once with \\"Meat Puppets II\\" and this thing. \\"Backwater\\" is a great, if  perhaps nonsensical pop hit, theres a few other listenable things here, but anyone that thinks this is one of the best albums of the nineties needs to put the bong down. I hated MPII as well. Both just lack verve and replayablilty, you have no idea what the heck theyre singing about, and the music is too lackluster to make up for the weird lyrics. Now I have heard bits of their first record, and that sounds like fun, but this is not that band. Sometimes, its best that punk bands dont learn to play their instruments. The Meat Puppets are evidence of that.
B000002MTR|3.0|One Hot Minute is a decent album with songs great songs like coffe shop and pea, but doesn't really match the intensity of the red hot chilli peppers like their other albums do. There was a lot of internal striff in the band while the band was making the album whcih probably makes the album sound the way it does. In the end, one hot minute may not be their best album, but it good for those seeking to get the full spectrum of the red hot chilli peppers.
B000002AP1|5.0|Will make the dog wet, your momma cry, and your neighbor claw at his wallpaper. More metal on this record than any of its stepchildren. Possibly the worst album recorded in terms of fidelity, but the cd remaster brings some of the bite back. Fully realized  classic rock and roll on &quot;Shake Appeal&quot;, and of course, you are hopelessly unhip if you haven't heard &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;.
B00004W5UA|5.0|I remember walking out of the theater after seeing fight club around midnight. I felt really strange but in a good way. I've never really seen anything like fight club before or after. Repeated viewings of the movie are still really interesting from what new things you pick up. It really helped to make edward norton one of my favorite actors. From start to finish, it's really a guessing game of what will happen next.
B000002KIE|5.0|now cool to trash. Such is the fickleness of the populace. Is this record contrived? Yes. Is the joke on you? Yes. Is it alot of fun to listen to? Uh-huh. Do you really need to know any more? So what if they cant play, neither can I. So Johnny Rotten is annoying. He sounds great here to me, theres no mistaking him for anyone else, thats for sure.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Californications is probably the best album that the Red Hot Chilli Peppers have ever done. It's a lot more personal in its lyrics then previous Chilli Peppers albums and the band muscially seems to be it its most advanced stage to date. It really is their most mature album. The old material like from mother's milk is good but Californication is a testement to their staying power.
0446608955|3.0|Hey, when I saw that the movie was actually a book, I went out and got it. It wasn't the best thing in the world but I was curious as to how it was gonna end. I didn't really care for parts of it, like the author's writing techs and stuff, but it was a cute story...HOWEVER...it was way predictable. The people fell in love way too fast and it was just boring. The whole thing ended too early too and if you asked me, this book should have been at least a couple hundred pages. That's why I took off two stars.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|My french pen-pal recommended this to me and so I bought it and I absolutely ADORE it!  First of all the music is just so beautiful and the words are beautiful to listen to even if you don't understand them. Everyone has incredible voices.  Especially the guys.  Garou has the perfect voice for Quasimodo. Now that I have translated all of the words I love it even more.  They are so deep and romantic!  \\"Mourir pour toi n'est pas mourir\\" is the last line in the last song \\"Danse mon Esmerelda\\" and it means to die for you is not to die!  What a perfect ending!  It is so much better than the Disney version!!  My favorite songs are Le temp de cathedrales, la monture and deschire.  I really recommend you get this version of Notre Dame de Paris and not the English one because the French one just has so much better lyrics.  The lyrics to the English one sound like a bad translation of the French one!!
B000056K04|5.0|Dave Matthews Band is a live band, not a studio band. For many of the DMB fans who haven't seen them live, I pity you. Live at Luther College is a good album, but it's not nearly as good as Live in Chicago. Live in Chicago is one of the greatest albums of all-time. In terms of intensity and pure power of every song, it can't be beat. <BR> <BR>When Remember Two Things and Under The Table and Dreaming came out, I didn't think much of DMB until I saw them live in '95 at the Charlotte Arena, I've been hooked ever since. Same goes for Everyday. When I saw them in Charlottesville, VA last year, the album did a 180. Before you write off anything by Dave, see them live, you will not regret it. <br />Expect DMB to start sounding more and more differently with Glen Ballard at the helm, I will buy whatever Dave comes out with, but when you cut members out of the band (Boyd Tinsley on Everyday), you start losing fans.

B000002LRX|5.0|Even after tasting popularity and critical success with The Real Thing, Faith No More regarded artistic exploration as more valuable than record sales. Good thing too, or we'd probably have never heard this outstanding record. Angel Dust is an immaculate piece of daring songcraft and studio magic -- the perfect album for anyone who likes challenging music. Even ten years after its release, there has been nothing like it.<br />Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), describing the effect of Angel Dust's bold experiment is like trying to describe a sunrise to a blind man. Yes, you can explain the hues of the sky, the way \\"rods & cones\\" in your eyes pick up light and color, and maybe the physics of celestial bodies. But do you really convey the simple majesty of dawn? Angel Dust is like that...it's so strange and interesting that it's difficult to discuss in specific terms. Perhaps my analogy is a bit over-the-top, but I do believe Angel Dust is one of the most original albums by anybody, ever. You really have to listen to it to understand it.<br />From a biased point of view, I might pick \\"Caffeine\\" as my favorite, because it starts with MONKEY SOUNDS (which moves into vicious thrashy riffs and murderous screams). But actually, it's tough to pick out favorite songs from Angel Dust, because all are interesting and different and add something special to the album. The album is low on hooks -- the cheerleader bravo chorus on \\"Be Aggressive\\" is quirky and catchy; \\"Everything's Ruined\\" has a very singable refrain; \\"A Small Victory\\" is a more laid-back rocker with smooth melodies.<br />But everything else is much more offbeat and weird. As a matter of fact, Angel Dust's music is often violent, deranged, and frightening. There's something certainly unsettling about the opener, \\"Land of Sunshine\\", where Mike Patton's maniacal laughter, odd carnival-flavored keyboards, and punching bass line create an addictive wall of sound. \\"Crack Hitler\\" is spooky, with its funk-inspired guitar & bass interplay juxtaposing a sinister keyboard melody and Patton's creepy vox. \\"RV\\" is just plain bizarre, based on the piano with Patton playing the part of some guy speaking his thoughts as he sits in his trailer. \\"Jizzlobber\\" is about as haunting and fierce as music can get, but it throws you off by ending with a grand church organ. As diverse as every song is, somehow the pieces always manage to fit. Even the band's take on the \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" theme suits perfectly as a mellow conclusion to the craziness that has gone before.<br />If you're looking for an album that will remain fresh and interesting for 100 years, Angel Dust is for you.ar & bass interplay juxtaposing a sinister keyboard melody and Patton's creepy vox. \\"RV\\" is just plain bizarre, based on the piano with Patton playing the part of some guy speaking his thoughts as he sits in his trailer. \\"Jizzlobber\\" is about as haunting and fierce as music can get, but it throws you off by ending with a grand church organ.

B000000OSG|5.0|After being in release for more then a decade now, Use Your Illusion II is still a great album to listen to. It's interesting to hear songs like Civil War, 14 years, and yesterdays because they are pretty far removed from the traditional guns n' roses but there are still the traditional guns n' roses songs like get in the ring and shotgun blues.
B000000993|5.0|As a progressive rock fan who entered Tool's world with Lateralus, I've been collecting their albums in reverse order. It's pretty strange going from Lateralus (their most progressive) to Opiate (their \\"simplest\\"). It must have been very interesting for fans who started at the beginning and watched this remarkable band grow into the powerhouses they are now.<br />At face value, Undertow seems simple and heavy, pulled down because of a muddy mix that never seems to raise the guitars above a buzz or Maynard James Keenan's voice to the heights where it should soar. It's more song-oriented than the multifaceted epics of Lateralus and even ::whoa!:: catchy at times. I love the rapid, quick-fingered picking of the infectious main riff for \\"Bottom\\". Heavy stuff can have hooks too, right?<br />At face value...<br />Undertow, however, is a pretty rich heavy metal album. Only traces of the alternative/grunge sound hover around Undertow's edges -- mainly the production style and some of the riffs. But in most respects, this is very much a metal record. Intellectually, however, Tool steps well beyond most metal bands with innovative musical intricacies and astute lyrics. Keenan is one of the most powerful vocalists in rock/metal, and his delivery is perfectly dramatic on songs like \\"Sober\\" (with its powerful ending) and \\"Crawl Away\\", where he whispers and roars. Adam Jones is a very unique guitarist, not playing conventional solos, and usually basing his playing on just a few chords per song. However, Tool is more about band interplay than individual playing: Danny Carey's exact and meticulous drumming; Paul d'Amour's gritty, growling bass; Jones' scratching guitar sounds, silent nuance, or earsplitting power chords. The title track is the most dynamic musically, with clever riffs and awesome vocals. \\"4 Degrees\\" shows the band's interest in Middle Eastern influences (which would inform parts of Lateralus). I recommend getting the lyrics from Tool's site and following along as you listen. It really gives the songs more impact.<br />And, of course, we expect a Tool album to have something weird on it. The trippy 16-minute \\"Disgustipated\\" finishes off the album, starting on track 10 and ending on track 69. Tracks 10-68 are just blank, 1-second bits. Then, on track 69, things start to happen. There's some dialogue, some sounds, some singing, and a *bit* of music. Listen closely to the words and think about it...interesting stuff. It's amusingly weird and cool.<br />Explore one of the best bands out there.ou listen.

0780625129|5.0|American history X really helped to show me how much of a great actor Edward Nortan is. From start to finish, he gives a strong performance with Edward Furlong about two troubled young men. I have seen this movie several times and it never gets old.
B00004XPPK|5.0|This is one of the best films in Rita Hayworth's career and one of the most glamorous movies of old Hollywood.  Gilda is a complicated woman trapped between two men, trying to deal with her feelings for one and devotion to another.  Gilda contains her memorable striptease/dance to the song &quot;Put the Blame on Mame&quot; and is full of great quotes (&quot;If I was a ranch, they'd call me the bar none!&quot;). Rita's sultry portrayal of the main character sets the screen on fire and you are drawn to her in every scene that she appears in.  This role is one of the great femme fatales of cinematic history and worth having in any dvd collection. I think people often overlooked Rita Hayworth's acting because of her beauty and never took her seriously.  If you want to see a beautiful, talented actress take a role and make it irresistable to watch, buy Gilda.  You won't regret it.
B000000OSE|5.0|I remember when the use your illusion albums came out and how great they were at the time. More then a decade later, the albums are still great. Use your illusion I has little more of an aggressive sound to it with songs like right next door to hell, garden of eden and dust N' bones. Listening to this album gives you the real sense that this is what Guns N' Roses is really all about.
6304057709|5.0|Immerse yourself in the rich tapestry of life in London and Devonshire with Mrs. Dashwood and her three beautiful daughters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret. Mr. Dashwood has died, and due to the laws of inheritance in 19th century England, the handsome estate passes to the male descendants, and the Dashwood women are evicted by their evil sister in law, Fanny Dashwood, with only 500 pounds a year to support themselves. The Jennings', kind but eccentric cousins in Devonshire, offer them the use of their drafty stone cottage for a nominal rent, and they are packed off and moved with only one servant to attend to their needs.<br />Elinor (portrayed perfectly by Emma Thompson), the sensible oldest sister, has a tight rein on her emotions and is ever aware of the proprieties of single women in society, and struggles to keep within their budget. She mourns the fact that ladies are taught no useful skills, are not allowed to earn their living and are totally dependent on the largesse of men. She has also fallen in love with Edward Farris (Hugh Grant), the brother of Fanny, but Fanny is intent on keeping them apart, for the family has grander plans for Edward.<br />Marianne (Kate Winslet), is the emotional, romantic expressive younger sister who recites Shakespearean sonnets, and plays mournful, romantic songs on the pianoforte. She falls passionately in love with John Willoughby, the handsome rake from a nearby estate, who toys with her affections but never openly declares his love for her. All the while, she is being courted by Colonel Brandon, a mature thoughtful and sensitive gentleman who is smitten with this spirited middle sister.<br />The youngest sister, Margaret, still a child of 12 or so, is playful and loves to study her atlas and travel in her mind.<br />The verdant scenery, opulent period costumes, and lavish English manors and ballrooms will mesmerize you. The sisters are romantic, witty and funny, perfectly cast and supported by a wonderful cast of characters. This is a film that I will watch over and over to rediscover all the nuances of conversation and character interactions and revel in the beautiful scenery. Emma Thompson's award for best screenplay was well deserved.ers.

0451169514|4.0|This is only the second Stephen King book I've read, and I can tell you it is Great! It is not merely a horror story, it's much more complex than that, and drives you to so much thinking, I spent three nights unable to sleep. When you get to the really scary parts, I suggest you sit in a well-lit room and have some company. I was terrrified of using the bathroom for quite some time, I'd rush in and out, no showers! This book has high levels of horror, gore, violence and to an extent sex. Therefore I really don't reccomend it to anyone below 13.<BR>But the missing star is for the pace of the story. The book progresses very slowly at the beginning, too many subplots, and uneccesary detail. But the last third of the book gives you the impression that King was finnally tired of this, and decided to finish it now and there. The ending was ....weird, a tiny bit dissapointing, and a trifle confusing perhaps. And too many ends were left unraveled.<br />But all in all, just read this book and have fun!

B00003CX8I|5.0|I protested seeing this movie until my cousins made me watch it.  I am beginning to wonder why I protested.  \\"X-Men\\" defines \\"science-fiction\\".  It's not easy living in the \\"not so distant future\\" knowing that whenever you touch someone, something bad happens to them (like a friend being in a coma).  Unfortunately, Marie (more commonly known as Rogue) has to live with this mutation.  Unable to live with her mutation, Rogue runs away.  She soon finds herself face-to-face with Logan (Wolverine): a man with incredible healing powers and metal througout his entire circulation system, which gives him his metal claws.  Rogue befriends Wolverine and they set off together.  On the road, they hit a tree in the road and Wolverine goes soaring through the windshiled, leaving Rogue trapped in the car with a fire burning inside.  As Wolverine goes to help Rogue, he is attacked by Sabertooth: a mutant who works for the evil Magneto, a mutant with the ability to bend metal, who is trying to turn all humans into mutants with his machine.  Fortunately, Rogue and Logan are saved by Cyclops (lasers that shoot through his eyes when they open) and Storm (ability to create a storm) and are taken to Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Students (which unknown to the public helps mutants secure their mutations).  Xavier promises to help Logan and Rogue.  But after Rogue flees from the school, Logan defies Xavier and goes to rescue her.  When he finds Rogue, Magneto and his mutants appear.  Magneto kidnaps Rogue and runs off with her.  The X-Men sit down and finally they discover why Magneto wanted Rogue: he is planning to use her power to harness another mutant's power against the world.  He will give her his power, and then she will power his machine which will transform all of the humans to mutants.  There is only one consequence: Rogue will die from the machine.  And after Xavier becomes deathly ill, it's up to the X-Men to save the day.  With great action, romance, and the occasional hilairous remark, \\"X-Men\\" is THE movie of the year!

B00002Z88D|5.0|This is definetely Metallica's best albums. My only complaint is they didn't do Fade to Black. Anyway, Metallica being backed up by one of the best symphonies is awesome. They play much faster live, and the symphony adds an incredible element to the ballads, and gives the heavy tracks an even harder edge. &quot;One&quot; on this album is seriously one of my top 5 favorite songs of all time. The softer part of the song is mindblowing, and the heavy part is extremely fast, which goes to show Metallica are NOT goin' soft. Also, &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot; is pumped up a lot, and is one of the heaviest tracks on these albums. &quot;Battery&quot; is great, but Lars's drums are much more drowned out than on Puppets. I was disappointed by &quot;Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; because Jason's bass sounds to &quot;funky&quot; and drowned out. Just listen to it and youll understand. Puppets is really fast and heavy, and &quot;Fuel&quot; and &quot;Hero of the Day&quot; are better than the album versions in my opinion.The two new tracks goes to show yet again, Metallica aren't going soft anytime soon. Check this out if your a fan of any of Metallica's work.
B000002LEE|5.0|After all these years, Jane's addiction still sounds great. It's easy to see from NOthing shocking why they are such an important band in alternative rock. They helped give rise to a lot of the grunge bands of the 1990s. From start to finish, Jane's addiction gives a strong performance with each song. Jane says, mountain song, had a dad and ocean's song are probably the best tracks on the album.
B000003C2U|5.0|Probably one of the top-ten best albums ever made. I really wish metal was still like this today, although I like nu-metal. This album was way ahead of it's time (so was \\"Scream Bloody Gore\\"). The drums are probably the fastest I have ever heard (yes, I think the drummer is even faster than Trimm of Emperor). The guitars are extremely fast and complex, and the bassist of Death is mindblowing. And of course, Chuck is one of my favorite vocalists. He's such an amazing vocalist, words really cant describe him, and I hope he is resting in peace. Tracks 1-4 are my favorites, but they're all good. If you like this (and you very well should) pick up Symbolic and Scream Bloody gore immediatly.
B000002LIX|5.0|Ritual de lo Habitual is Jane's addiction most popular album. The album is great and is short with only nine songs. HOwever, the album is definetely strong despite its short length. The album helped to launch Jane's addiction into the mainstream, but the band did not lose any creative energy while producing this album. After more than a decade in release, ritual de lo habitual is still a great album.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Alright I'll cut out all the negative Star Wars vibes for all the geeks out there, this film was just plain boring, pure and simple.<br />Boring, boring, boring.  It was really boring.
B000021XR5|5.0|No 4 came after a 3 and half year gap from stone temple pilots. The previous album-Tiny Music- was met with cold shoulders because Tiny Music sounded so much different from core and purple. No 4 was really an important album for the band. The band did not let down with No4. The album brings the band back to the sounds we remember from core and purple. There are hard songs like sex & violence and Atlanta but more laid back songs like sour girl which really marks STP's sound of being one that can do more then one type sound.
B0000048V8|5.0|My daughter and I love this film too, we can't buy it overseas.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|When the pawn moves is another great work from fiona apple and it interesting to see her grow from her first album-Tidal. The album is filled with great songs like Limp and fast as you can. The great songwriting and emotion stays with her from tidal.
B00005TT77|2.0|&#65279;i would have to say it was a mistake buying this album. the majority of the songs suck. it's sounds like it's been slapped together over night. they butchered all the classics.  if you are a real beatles fan this cd will do nothing but aggravate you. but if you actually enjoyed this cd and your not a beatles fan i suggest buying any one of beatles albums.
0060955775|5.0|He's done it again.  If you loved The Alchemist, rush out to your bookstore (don't even wait to buy it online and wait for shipment) and immediately buy this book! I don't know which I like better.  Other reviewers can tell you what it's about, but frankly, with this author's books, you're better not knowing and just falling in love with reading it.  A perfect book for reading when things are crazy, life isn't as expected, or even when life is perfect.  It's a soul searching novel, asking you to delve deep into changing the situation to create happiness around you.
B000059T00|2.0|If there were more than six total tunes here, this would be a very worthwhile album. CANT FIND MY WAY BACK HOME,even if its falsetto vocals wear very thin, and PRESENCE OF THE LORD are two of the best songs of that time, and are still pretty good today, but the rest is mainly filler. Early Cream is much better, even though one can appreciate these guys were trying to do something new. Most of it doesn't stand up today though.
B00001W0FD|3.0|I have watched this movie several times over the years and consider it to be very well done for a &quot;B&quot; movie. Because it was filmed in b/w the mood was made eery without having to use a lot of special effects. In fact several parts are VERY eery. The only thing that kept me from rating it 4 or 5 was the terrible quality of the tape. The first time I saw it I rented it and was rewarded with a flawless tape. When I bought the tape I was rewarded with junk. The picture completely disappears for seconds at a time and jumps and jitters almost continually. My suggestion would be to skip the tape and go for a DVD.
B00005K3OT|4.0|It's a little surprising how many reviewers here at Amazon who did not like this insisted on calling it \\"Liberal\\" etc, which seems to be such an all-encompassing word these days. It's true the church does not play well in this flick, though the novice,nervous young priest seems to come off just fine at the very end! Face it, this is a very well photographed late 1950's small town trip to France, though I wonder how many small French towns then or now are in the grip of such dull, repressed,almost medieval types. Yes, the lady comes to town with her chocolate shop, and whips up a little bit of tolerance and fun into a generally dismal group. There actually is violence here with the lunatic drunk almost strangling the chocolatier, and the short sex scene when this charming bohemian lady tells her daughter of grandad's escapades in Central America. Given the innocence of the story, this seems like another Hollywood soft porn voyeur effort, completely unnecessary. And then she shacks up with the hippy type boatman at the end of the party. Also, something odd, and something else for liberal-haters to assault! But I enjoyed the numerous, and well done church scenes...I'd give it a higher rating except that too many characters are too stereotyped, especially the pious mayor, who seemed incongrously nasty at times. And the ending was a little too pat...All in all, a pretty good movie, not just for those with a sweettooth! There's no denying a certain pleasant charm here, in a generally charmless era of moviemaking!
6303566448|4.0|This is probably one of the best horror films ever made.  Jeffery Combs stakes his claim as a madman, and is likely to be typecast due to his natural finesse with this sort of role.  If you are a horror enthusiast, this is in your collection.  If you don't have it, you can't call yourself a real enthusiast.<BR>The Frankenstein theme goes one step further with ReAnimator.  Soaked with blood and gore, with a spattering of humor for good taste (!?) this move is remarkable.  Plot is typical, acting is par/above par for this genre, and the direction is well above par.
0316776963|4.0|Gets quite a chuckle out of me - occasionally I come across a paragraph in his book that I don't expect, and just tears me up laughing!
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater has been around for quite along time. Since the beginning they have been regarded as one of the best if not the best Progressive band around. To tell you the truth, I'd have to agree. After the very successful \\"Metropolis Pt:2 Scenes From A Memory, many fans were afraid DT would not be able to top that with their newest release. So now the time is at hand, and that question is now answerable. So, does \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" beat out \\"Scenes From a Memory\\"? The answer is unsurprisingly no. But do not let that discourage you from getting this CD. \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" is damn near impossible to beat. Aside from \\"Images & Words\\", \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" is DT's best. <br />\\"SdoIT\\" is a real treat for DT fans though! Not only do we get 5 songs that average 10min each. We get a very welcomed second disc that contains the title track, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. A very polished and well composed 42min song! Personally I find myself listening to that more times over than \\"Change of Seasons\\". <br />\\"SdoIT\\" has to be one of the best DT albums from a lyrical stand point. I absolutely love some of the content on these songs. Subjects range from acceptance of death, self realization, religion, science VS morality, and psychological turmoil. This has to be the best lyrical album DT has put out yet! <br />Sound consistency has never been DT's strong point, and it shows here. Ever since \\"I&W\\" we have yet to hear a single DT album replicate that sound. When we heard \\"Awake\\", while it was good, just seemd like it was missing something. Many thought the CD was void of soul. We won't even disuss the commercialness of \\"Falling into Infinity\\". Then came \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" a brilliant pice of music with hints of classic Dream Theater. But still nothing like any album beforehand. Now we have \\"SdoIT\\". At some points in the album it doesn't even sound like Dream Theater. So what are the songs? Let's review them: <br />The Glass Prison- At initial listen, you can tell immediately that this is going to be different. Suddenly the song bursts into double-bass frenzy, and ceases to stop! The only break is the chorus which is the only part that actually sounds like a Dream Theater song. This is a great start to any CD! Even a DT CD! <br />Blind Faith- A very \\"Heavy Metal\\" type song. Seems there was a lot of influence of old 80's metal in this song. It may be just me though. This is a great song as well! <br />Misunderstood- The song name states it all. I think alot of DT fans will bypass this song simply because there is nothing DT about it. Its a simple, catchy ballad. NO time changes, NO solos. So I'm going to tell you all here, do not let this song go unheard! It's a great little tune that will stick in your head time and time again. Nice and soothing effects abound and a very well written chorus makes this an all-round decent song. <br />The Great Debate- This is my personal favorite on the album. The song starts off w/ about 3min worth of dialogue consisting of sampled new's broadcasts discussing cloning and the subject of playing god through science. The song itself sounds nothing like DT(big surprise). In fact, this song could pass for a Tool song. Aside from the chorus the rest of the first half might as well be a Tool song. Suddenly about half way through Jordan Ruddess remembers \\"HEY! We're not Tool, we're Dream Theater!!\\" and bursts into a classic Ruddess solo! Guitar and Keyboard are layered perfectly and the switches between the two remind me of why I love DT! A sudden rising of double-time playing then to triple-time playing commences and crashes into a one of the best riffs I have ever heard! The song then ends to the same dialogue we heard in the beginning. <br />Disappear- DT took a very different approach to writing this song. Its a very soothing piece with nothing special to note. In fact it seems they were influenced by Radiohead while writing this song, you decide. <br />Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence-This is the BIG one. 42min worth of music. A 8 part song of epic proportions. This song is very content heavy. Lyrical wise its, about different people with different psychological struggles, and how man can overcome them. Its a very nicely written song... influences range from classical music, to jazz, to Rush. This song is very DT reminiscent and thats a good thing! One of the longest and BEST songs I have ever heard in my life! The song alone is worth the [price] admittance fee. <br />So should you get this CD? If your a DT fan already, I'm sure you already have this CD playing in your CD-Player. If your not, I suggest buying it. Its not DT heavy. Which means the complexity isn't as pretentious as previous releases. Which could very well make this easier for others to digest. As for me, I love the CD! At first it took awhile to get into, because I was expecting time-changes abound and complex playing. We get hints and traces of that here which is enough to satisfy even me
1583762027|4.0|I read this book in an airplane between Montreal and Toronto two weeks ago.  It took me about 30 minutes to read it.   What you will find here is 21 tips on how to reduce procrastination.  For sure if you apply some of those ''secrets'' it will greatly help you to overcome procrastination.  I really appreciated reading this book. It was very easy to undestand and right to the point.  There is a little bit to much repetition, but I think that's ok.  If you haven't read any book on procrastination, Eat that Frog is a nice starting point.   The price is a little to high so you may want to go for the audio version.
0679601686|5.0|OK, maybe the title was a little much, but from what i have read...it is.  Elizabeth Bennet is a young, satirical, young woman who is prejudiced against Mr. Darcy, a charming yet snobby man.  The two argue throughout the entire book but when she realizes her misperception of him, they finally begin to love one another.  This is perhaps one of the best parts of the novel, in my opinion.<br /><br />The characters are amazingly sketched out and Mrs. Bennt takes the cake!  I had a lot of fun reading her comments as well as the sisters.<br /><br />Even though I am only thirteen, I believe that I fully grasped the novel.  The words are a bit confusing, so keep a dictionary on you at all times.<br /><br />Jane Austen is one of my favorites, if not my most favorite, and I want everyone to read at least one of her novels!
B00005JKT8|4.0|Now I must admit...this movie was nothing exceptional.  There were no high tech special effects, deep plotline, guns, sex like your typical \\"top\\" movies out there today.<br />On the contrary, this movie is very simple.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out.  An unexpected couple..overcome the odds (and in this case, time), fall in love, and live happily ever after.<br />Yes, the whole time twist at times was incredibly corny, but it still gives this movie a touch of something unfamiliar to today's audience. (Perhaps that it doesn't take place in an American high school?)<br />Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman are sweet.  They fit their roles quite well, and seem to have thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br />Simply stated, this movie was cute.  Nothing exceptional, but surely, something at least worth renting a few times.  It's a very good date movie, certainly.  I imagine watching this movie cuddled up with a loved one by a fire...ahhh....l'amour. ;)
B00004SGNM|5.0|Although SACD is a phenomenal improvement over regular CD sound IF you've got the right equipment, this review pertains to the artistic content of the album, and as such applies to either version.  I was a junior in college when this album was released, and though even then I thought \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" was a bit too quirky and \\"bubble-gum\\" for my taste - the track has stood the test of time remarkably well.  My appreciation has only increased since then.  Better examples of Lauper's amazing ability to emote through her vocals are \\"Time After Time\\", and \\"All through the night.\\"  No less an artist than Linda Ronstadt has commented that Lauper's ability to express emotion in her vocal style is amazing.  This is no faint praise.  To set the record straight - as some younger reviewers evidently don't have a clue - \\"She Bop\\" is a rather obvious statement about masturbation.  'Everybody does it - what's the big deal?', is the message here. Lauper directly acknowledged this during an appearance on Dr. Ruth Westheimer's TV show, \\"Good Sex\\", years ago.   \\"Money Changes Everything\\", both the studio and live version, is a standout as well.  Anyone who has seen Lauper perform live knows what a musical perfectionist she is.  Her live performances are sensational, something I noticed from the time \\"Girls\\" hit the charts, and Cyndi hit the talk-show circuit to promote the album.  I'd also strongly recommend Lauper's later work, particularly \\"Hat Full of Stars\\", a brilliant album that was panned by many ignorant critics and did not enjoy much commercial success.  What a shame.  Great singer AND songwriter - much more than her superficial oddball persona would seem to indicate.  Listen to this album and I guarantee you'll be impressed.
079073382X|5.0|Wow.  I just finished watching this movie a few minutes ago.  I then read some reviews.  Most of the reviews said it was sweet but too talky and unambitious.  What! Perhaps there's some truth to the talkiness complaint but the ambition is clear and full-plated: show the rapture, disappointment, and motivations of relationships through the microcosm of a 24 hour encounter between two people. I really can't believe what a GREAT movie Before Sunrise is.  I am completely moved and touched and astonished by the sheer power of this film.  I watched most of this movie with a big grin on my face- a grin of happiness.  This film made me truly joyous.  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy had such a beautiful romance together.  No matter what your sexuality, you'll think they're BOTH hot by the end of this movie.  They had little quirks to their personalities that made them seem human and the camera makes them attractive.  I love this movie and I can't wait to see it again if not just to hear the brilliant conversations that perfectly assess life AS IT IS.  Do they ever meet again on the train in six months?  Someone please write a sequel!
B00005UEAR|5.0|in the fine tradition of  Of Dream Theaters past albums (When Day &amp; Dream unite, Images And Words, Awake, Change Of Seasons, Falling Into Infinity, Once In A live Time , Metropolis 2 scenes from a memory)  Six Dreams Of Inner Turbulence is a musical masterpiece from begining to end.  The best band never to get radio airplay on mainstream radio or music channels
6302548195|5.0|This is the best documentary/movie i have ever seeen. you get to learn about the personality and dedication of Arnold. After watching this flick i have a whole new perspective and view of bodybuilding. Great for motivation and a laugh.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Yes, I just went to go see the stunning film A Beautiful Mind. It was a film of drama and realitly of what can happen when people have scitzophrania. This is a great film for anybody seeking drama, phycoligically scary movies, and great ending to any movie. I urge you to see this movie...It's wonderful
0553260111|4.0|This was my first Ludlum book -- and I was very impressed.  For this genre, it is rare that you find yourself thinking about the details of the plot between the times you are able to read.<br />I really enjoyed how the author slowly revealed the main character to the audience.  My only complaint is that the other characters seemed to be a little shallow (minus a star for this...)<br />The story is that a man is brought to a doctor with horrible injuries and no memory of who he is or was.  The doctor only shows him a piece of microfilm surgically implanted into his body with the name &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; and a number of a bank account.  This man must figure out who he is while he is being chased by the police and other assassins (who know him, but he doesn't know them...)<br />Great story -- You will probably figure out the ending towards the end of the book, but you won't be able to put it down regardless.
B00003CX9E|5.0|In his commentary on this DVD director Peter Bogdanovich remarks on how Orson Welles once told him that while aspects of Citizen Kane had been mightly influential, (deep focus, overlapping dialogue, having the ceiling in a shot,) the things that Welles thought truly important about the film were never widely used by film-makers. Bogdanovich doesn't elaborate on what exactly the Master considered the important aspects of the film but from what I know about Welles I would have to think that what he considered truly valuable about Kane was its use of illusion, misdirection, and audience expectation to tell the tragic story of Charles Foster Kane.  From a dramatic standpoint Welles' goal was to produce a truly Shakespearean vision in then modern day America but from a cinematic view the film-maker's intent remained true to the qualities he had brought to both his stage and radio productions.  Namely ambiguity, uncertainty, magic.  Nothing in Kane is as it seems.  Temporal and spatial perception are as malleable as the ore which gave Kane his wealth. Characters walk into photographs, Newsreels become real, locations freeze into newspaper headlines.  One such headline famously describes Kane's love Susan Alexander as \\"singer\\".  Jed Leland says Kane \\"spent his whole life trying to remove those quotes.\\"  But all of Citizen Kane is in quotes.<BR>The DVD is excellent, the film looks spectacular, and the extras are fun.  The commentaries by Ebert and Bogdanovich are fascinating.  Ebert's commentary focuses more on the film, with almost shot by shot explanations of what's going on, while Bogdanovich's comments are more personal, more concerned with warm anecdotes about his friend Orson.  There are at least two 'Easter Eggs' contained in the menu selection, one an interview with Robert Wise, the other with Ruth Warrick.  Both are interesting, if too short. The American Experience documentary on Disc 2 provides the fascinating backstory behind the film's production, but I, for one, believe one shouldn't make too much of 'Kane-Hearst' parallels or 'Kane-Welles' parallels, for that matter.  The joy of the film rests in its timeless inventiveness; its examination of both the historical and the ephemeral, and how the two intertwine; the humor, warmth, and pathos of the characters.  <BR>This is an essential for any DVD library.
B000051S44|5.0|Fantastic if you are a motor racing fan, especially if you love Porsches.  Probably my all time favourite film which shows McQueen's passion for racing and his desire for realism.  From the first sight of his road going 911 'til the credits, I'm sure I don't blink sometimes.
B00005U2LM|4.0|It's like a dagger in the heart to actually even think the thoughts: \\"The Wu have fallen off.\\" The Wu-Tang Clan are close to my heart. They were the first hip-hop I EVER listened to. If you can imagine the impact that had on a 8th grade kid still slightly obsessed with martial art flicks and comic book heroes - you would know that everytime someone gives the Wu less than four stars, it HURTS. The Wu had so much potential, so much thrust behind its drive that at one time if you held a Wu record in your hand, you could walk through brick walls. But the truth hurts and nowadays I'm listening to more Cannibal Ox than Wu-Tang. And \\"Iron Flag\\" is more admirable, than likeable. It's a bit unfair to trash on \\"Iron Flag\\" quite so much, its a solid effort despite a few bad tunes namely \\"Chrome Wheels\\" and \\"Soul Power\\". Yet like a previous reviewer said it seems as if the Wu are coloring in by numbers, as if all the members threw their hands up in their air and sighed and said, \\"Alright, let's get in the studio together...\\" Where's the hunger? Where's that raw power? I'm not asking for another 36 Chambers, I'm just asking for some synergy here, some small spark to reignite the passion that I once had. At one time, I beheld RZA as a genius, now he's an tragic hero with an Achilles heel. What went wrong? But enough complaining, \\"Iron Flag\\" is admirable, as an attempt for the Wu to reclaim former glories. \\"Babies\\" is a stirring song with a forlorn chorus lamenting the streets. \\"Rules\\" sounds like a Premier beat with the cut-up scratching, but it's still one of the most banging songs on the CD. \\"In The Hood\\" mixes up a chaotic barrage of machine gun fire, late night ambulances, and sirens. And \\"Uzi\\", lands a one-two sucker punch of calvary horns. Tracks like \\"Y'All Been Warned\\" and \\"Iron Flag\\" have that Wu-Tang Forever gloomy cinematic quality, but \\"Chrome Wheels\\" is absolutely horrible. I'm talking holding your throat, reching into a gutter on the streets horrible. There is no way you can salvage the song. Flava Flav is totally out of place on \\"Soul Power\\", Ol' Dirty ... brought a unstable edge, Flava Flav brings cheesy P.E. 80s nostalgia. Still no, check it out for yourself, I still listen to this album and it was worth the purchase if only for \\"Babies\\". It's really a uneven, but good effort from the Wu-Tang Clan. In conclusion, maybe the dagger comes closer, but it hasn't found its way into my heart just yet.
B00005JKES|5.0|I was working overseas when the Twin Peaks phenomenon was in full force so I never had the opportunity, until now, to understand what it was all about.  Now I know!  I purchased both the pilot and the first season and watched them straight through.  I loved it all - when will the next season's DVD be released - I can't wait.<BR>PS. Before purchasing the first season's DVD, I read the reviews here and decided to purchase the pilot.  I think it's a really good idea to view the pilot prior to viewing the first season's DVD.
0812932293|5.0|Branson not only knows how to get by in business, but he knows how to grab on to a reader, and hold them till the end. The book makes you want to read it right from the first page. An excellent account of Branson's childhood, business life and adventures, all integrated superbly. Each chapter, varied in topic gives you a taste of what's to come and simply will not let you put the book down. Wheteher it's Richard's love life, his balooning adventures, or his friendly relationship with British Airways that interests you most, no part of the book will let you down. Excellent. (I'll never fly BA in my life!)
B00005JKT8|5.0|I think this was one of Meg Ryans best movies. It was a classic love story. It was just absolutely wonderful.
B000007MVD|5.0|Prior to its official release, the recordings on this CD had been (maybe after Dylans \\"Basement Tapes\\")the most sought after bootlegs in existance. And like Dylans \\"Basement Tapes\\",they are indespensable to any collector of their music because both collections demonstrate not only the influences of these artists, but also how well they covered the music they loved, ( the Beatles & Dylan are the only 2 musicall phenomenas I can think of who could actually IMPROVE on the originall recordings they covered).<BR>  The CD shows, once it has been added to your collection of Beatle albums, how this greatest of all rock bands took what had come before they started making their own records, mastered it: & then forged it into the sound that would take over the world.As you listen to it, notice how songs like \\"soldier of love\\" is not just a cover of that song,(done originally by R& B singer Arthur Alexander, an american singer who they covered a number of times, eg. \\"Anna\\")but it has been transformed into a \\"Beatles\\" song- if you had been told it was one of their own compositions it would be easy to believe.<BR>You must understand, the Beatles didnt just come along in 1964 & create a new sound,(although they did do that also)They were as much a part of the first wave of rock & roll as someone like Little Richard, though their influence didnt extend far past Liverpool & Hamburgh at that time.<BR>   Rock critic Greil Marcus:\\"Consider the Beatles history.In 1955, John & Paul were playing something approximating rock & roll before they had ever heard of Elvis Presley (the same cannot be said of Buddy Holly);they wrote their 1st hit, \\"Love me do\\", before they heard \\"That'll Be The Day\\".In other words, when they signed with EMI they were not merly in touch with their roots; in a significant & probably unique sense, they WERE their roots. They were not only a PRODUCT of the pre-Beatle era of Rock, they were a VERSION of it.Accompanying the shock of novility so many experienced on 1stexposer to the Beatles in '64 was a shock of RECOGNITION, which bespoke the Beatles' connection to the whole history of rock n roll up to that time: the Beatles had absored that history because-year by year, playing & listening & writing, in Liverpool & Hamburg- they had, albeit invisibly, MADE IT.\\"<BR>  This CD is no weak effort to cash in on Beatle songs that had not priviously been made available, it should have been made available years ago. Also, if you dont even care about the evelution of rock n roll but you just like Beatles hits, on the 2nd disc there are recordings going up to 1965 of them doing many of their hits such as the great \\"Ticket to ride\\".etc. Imagine, A group as big as the Beatles going into a radio station to play music, I dont think they were even getting paid.<BR>  For me, one of the most remarkable things about them was, all the hype surronding them, all the fame they got before we even knew much about them except \\"I want to hold your hand\\", all the BEATLEMANIA of 1964,before even the movie \\"Hard days night\\" They lived up to it!(the fame). It just seemed obvious on 1st hearing them that they were the ones!<BR>We will never see their likes again.<BR>doug barr

0684833395|5.0|Generally, when students recieve a list of books to read for school, they can expect to spend many nights toiling away at what teachers think is fine literature. I had no great expectations of Catch-22 when I bought it. I had chosen this book because I had heard the expression Catch-22 used before, and figured it must be somewhat intresting if it was a fairly common expression.<br />The first two or three chapters went slowly like most books, somewhat difficult to understand why the Yossarian character was signing documents under other people's names. As the book progressed Joesph Heller becomes, in my mind one of the greatest comic geniuses of all time. <br />Ever joke in this book is a long-running joke throughout the book. Everything that could go wrong does. The theory of Catch-22 is so realistic it is comical. The entire book shows the horror of war, but creates a laughable atmosphere about it. There are several dark, and even grusome scenes in this book, however Heller seems to take a comical approach to all of them starting jokes about them the next chapter. The jokes in this book never end, each joke is seen again and again, until the very humorous end.<br />Don't be mistaken, although this book had me rolling on the floor laughing several times, it is also a great historical drama about life during World War 2 and the realism of fighting and Yossarian's fear of death for fighting something he doesn't belive in. <br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to all readers, as it is a Classic and is some of hte most enjoyable 400-something pages you'll read, more than likely, several times.
6305609705|5.0|I know some people who have told me befor they didn't care for the end hunting end of this movie, and even through this is one of my all time faveroit war movies I can still see were they are coming from. <br /> Apocalypse Now is the kind of movie that makes you want to see it over in case you mist something the first time around. Martin Sheen and the legandary Brando create timeless perfomances, and in my mind Frnces Ford Coppalla has created a better naritive drive than in the Godfather, but (I'm sure their some out there that will disagree with that Godfather statment) <br />em-m-m-m-m   6 stars actully!!
6305609705|4.0|Why should anyone buy APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX and not APOCALYPSE NOW? At first this re-release seemed an indulgence, but, don't be fooled, these are really two different movies. I did not like the original cut, but APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX is one of the best films ever made, and the best movie about Vietnam.<br />The original, because the French Plantation scene was cut, lacked an intellectual edge. The dialogue in that scene alone repays the time spent viewing the film. But restoration also makes the film flow. In the original, the final scenes with Kurtz almost seemed anti-climactic. But this one scene is like a psychic recharge and an intermission for the viewer, too, that punctuates the final scenes.<br />Also, restoring Brando's adlibs, reading TIME magazine clippings and seeing him interacting with the children gives his character substance and also gives the film more intellectual bite. Without the restored scenes, the movie is more a film version of Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\", but with them, it is an opinion about the American experience in Vietnam.<br />The restored scenes in the evac hospital and the stealing of the surfboard introduce comedy into the film and inciteful commentary on women and what war does to a person's psyche.<br />But, the second DVD is a waste of viewing time. The documentary about the filming of the movie would have been a much better addition. The second DVD duplicates the restored scenes and includes the technical aspects of the film usually tacked on to the DVD.<br />When I watched this movie in the theater, a Korean monk was in the audience. I know Korean monks are encouraged to get close to the public to experience the world, but I wondered what he thought about this film, which he watched in calm silence. After I finished watching, I realized the film was more spiritual with the restored scenes included. Innocence is never so precious as the moment when you realize you have lost it. Everyone should experience this film.
B000050FEN|5.0|If theres one thing that will come back to hunt you in your thoughts later on more than watch this film alone in the dark with dts sound. It would have to seening it a Americas largest screen alone, because David Fincher Knows how to shock and disturb.<br />But out of the grizzly, thought-provocking deaths and brillint acting by Brad Pitt, Morgen Freeman, and Keven Spacey comes an awsome rush like no other. Get yourself ready if you plain on buying this great sounding DVD with great extras!
6304806426|5.0|One of the best movies of the last decades; beautifully acted and perfectly crafted . It seems to polarize the people that watch it, must love it and some definitely hate it, probably due to it's central topic of adultery and it's slow pace. I certainly agree with the Academy and it's nine oscars and twelve nominations, with the New York Times, Time, Los Angeles Times and nearly every major critic,all of whom strongly recommended this film.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Just befor this movie came out I head that some of the real World War 2 vets. were very upset, because the flim makers had to stick a love story in the movie so Pearl Harbor would become the smash hit it did.<br />If you loved the way overrated Titanic then you will love Peal Harbor, but if your looking for an war movie like the awsome Tora! Tora! Tora! then don't wast your mony on this DVD. No wonder the Japs. were mad at this movie.
B00005U8EM|4.0|\\"Groundhog Day\\" is a movie that's aged really well in the past nine years, and I think will be looked back on as a classic comedy in a few decades.  Using a relatively simple plot device (Bill Murray's arrogant, pesudocosmpolitan character living the same day over and over in a small Midwestern town), Harold Ramis created a silly, sweet, touching romantic comedy that is endlessly rewatchable.<br />That said, though, I would've expected a great deal more from a 'Special Edition' of such a well-loved movie.  The main differences between this release and the original DVD release of a few years ago are the addition of a commentary track by Harold Ramis and a half-hour or so behind-the-scenes documentary.  The menus are also now animated and there are a few filmographies and trailers for other movies added, but these hardly help with the \\"Special Edition\\" status the disc is given.  The commentary track gives some interesting info on the movie, but Ramis spends a lot of time talking about the background actors and eventually wears a bit thin on the anecdotes.  If they could have gotten Bill Murray or Chris Elliott (or even Stephen Tobolowsky) to do the commentary track with him, it would've covered over a lot of the silences and helped with the narrative style, which Ramis keeps very light.  Nonetheless, Ramis's fondness for the movie comes out quite cleary, and he's still fun to listen to.  The documentary falls a bit flat in that in covers much of the same ground as the commentary track.  Save the few behind-the-scenes photos and outtakes, there's little there that Ramis doesn't discuss in his commentary.  Even more disappointing is that both refer to scenes that were shot and not used that do not appear in a 'Deleted Scenes' section.<br />If you liked the movie, but haven't picked the DVD up yet, I recommend getting this version over the original release.  If you already own the original DVD, though, there's little reason to pick this one up unless you're a huge fan ofthe movie.  I, for one, hope they eventually release a true 'Special Edition' with deleted scenes, press materials, the script (both Danny Rubin's original and with Ramis's revisions) and everything else we've come to expect from truly first-rate 'Special Editions' - which this one sadly isn't.
0792833201|5.0|I can rcall when I first saw this classic a few years ago, and I did not know what to make of it when it was over. The movie starts off with the family dog walking through the house early in the morning befor anyone has waken up yet, and just that alone is kind of sellbinding in a way. The visual effects in the flim are great and ahead of its time, and will stay in your mind awhile after watching them. <BR> <BR> I think the scareist part the film is the part were the mother is sucked aginst the bedroom walls by an invisible force.<BR>Stephen Spielberg and Tobie Hopper are masters at science Fiction<BR>and I hightly recomend this to any horror fan.
B00005UEAR|4.0|Dream Theater needs a new singer and they have since Falling Into Infinity. James LaBrie has plateaued while the rest of the group continue to progress. As much as this album rocks, it's hard for me to listen to LaBrie sing on it. As I listen to it, I'm drawn further and further toward something more satisfying, like Fates Warning's A Pleasent Shade of Gray. The reasons being: Fates Warning focus more on writing songs, whereas Dream Theater focus more on outdoing themselves; and Kevin Moore was the best keyboardist Dream Theater ever had. He may not have been the most talented, but he was the most creative. <BR>Dream Theater need to stop showing off and start writing songs again. They used to know how. Images and Words, A Change of Seasons and Awake hold Dream Theater's most memorable songs. The other day, a friend told me, &quot;Yeah, they know how to play. But it seems like that's all they're trying to show us,&quot; and sadly, I'm beginning to agree. There's nothing memorable about Dream Theater except they can play their instuments. Bob Dylan plays that same damn thing over and over again, but he will never be forgotten because his music has substance.
B0000524CY|5.0|WOW!! This is one chiller that really lived up to all the hyp., but I don't think the &quot;Virsion You've Never Sceen&quot; makes this twisted, unforgetable classic any better or any worse.<br />I still think it was totally right for someone in Hollywood to pick this project back up and repalay it in all the movie theaters across the nation so more of the younger generation are aware of it, and so they can get a tast of some real horror with brains.
B000002BE9|5.0|Tidal is a very accomplished debut album.  If there's anything wrong with it at all it's the producing by Andy Slater.  The sound quality is cheap and dry and the vibes and chamberlain add this dead atmosphere that makes you feel suicidal.  It's at once underproduced- They killed Sleep To Dream- a potentionally interesting song by laying only a drum track and a vocal track- and yet overproduced- the bizarre orchestrations in Carrion- don't fit the song whatsoever and occur seemingly to make the album go out with a big boisterous bang, denigrating the soulful and brilliant album that has just come previously.  And yet what saves Tidal is the sheer power of Fiona Apple's songwriting and vocal and piano talents.  God, this girl can sing as low as Barry White, as high as Mariah Carey, play the piano like a freakin' virtuoso, and croon with the personality and atmosphere of a black Jazz Club singer that's 3 times her age.  So much has been in the news about supposed songwriters such as Alicia Keys and Nelly Furtado, etc.  The major diff is that Fiona writes ALL of the music: music, lyrics, whereas they merely co-write or don't play an instrument on their songs.  Fiona is a goddess of the highest level.  How someone could be blessed with such an amazingly high intellect and both physical beauty doesn't seem real.  Tidal is essential of course, but for the same songwriting brilliance but MAJOR producing adjustment check out her second album, When the Pawn (produced by Jon Brion).
B000002AVF|5.0|23 million copies sold of this album. This was her second biggest selling album (after Music Box which sold 26 million copies)and her most critically acclaimed album. One only wishes that she would capture the brilliance of this album and replicate it into another 20 million selling album. The album is filled with so many tracks that could have also hit no.1 with the three songs released. If she had released underneath the stars, meltaway and forever as singles in america. This album i believe would have easily surpassed the 30 million copies mark.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Michael Bay is in my opinion a talented director.  With an impressive start with both Bad Boys and The Rock he has proved that he can deliver entertainment that is both commercially and critically well received.<br />Pearl Harbor just plain unfortunate.  To be handed a budget of approximately $135 million (negative costs only) and deliver this product represents a waste of Disney's resources.  Furthermore for this to occur under the helm of veteran blockbuster producer Jerry Bruckheimer is equally surprising.<br />One of Pearl Harbor's central flaws lies in its attempt to do too much.  It seems like the goal here was to emulate what James Cameron had pulled off in Titanic:  Drive a potent love story against the back drop of an epic event.  Sadly enough this goal was unrealized.<br />The characters are transparent and it is hard to empathize with any of the central characters because the core of the story revolves around two best friends basically fighting for the same girl, when either one could have demonstrated nobility in backing off.<br />Lastly, the movie is inaccurate.  The Japanese pilots destroyed almost all American planes that got of the ground, NOT the other way around.<br />Perhaps this large budget mishap is the reason Michael Bay has gone back to the drawing board and is taking on a lower-budget remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as his next endeavor.  I am sure he realizes that proving himself again as a great storyteller instead of a budget buster will restore the studios faith in his apparent talent.

B000002L82|5.0|This is the album where New Order emerged from the shadow of Joy Division and produced the  first classic in their own right.<BR>There is an exhuberence here to most of the tracks which was simply missing from the debut,the monolithic 'Movement'.<BR>Opener,'Age Of Consent' sets the tone with its clipped drum beat and solid bass leading to Bernard Sumner's plaintive vocals...But then in the middle of all this we have whoops of joy(on a New Order/Joy Division record!?!)and the most exquisite guitar solo...and we're having fun!<BR>Not much seems to have been written over the years about Barney's guitar playing on this album but I find it amazing.The album is sequencer-led but the guitar is just awesome,always there in the background,just art really...<BR>'The Village' is glorious and defines everything hedonistic about this band.A lot has been written about Joy Division being uplifting in a strange sort of way(true!)but this is less complicated and is...just uplifting.As if there needs to be a 'just' there...<BR>The opening track on side two(hey,I'm listening to this on scratchy Factory Records vinyl!)is a classic.Originally called 'KW1'after Kraftwerk,this is the sound of New Order moving on,beyond their contemporaries,beyond themselves.The melodica on its own would make this track but the way the vocals,the sequencers and the lyrics(always underrated so far as New Order are concerned)merge into the whole,a fragility until Peter Hook's driving bass piles in,just seems to me,can I say this,perfect.<BR>After that we have a bit of the old 'Ultraviolence' and the vocoder agony of 'Ecstacy' before the final,and best,track,'Leave Me Alone'.(Does this make it better than perfect!?!).Again it's the guitars,again it's just being lost in a feeling,in a place you really want to be.That the track is too short would be my only quibble.And that says everything...<BR> <BR>I understand 'Blue Monday' is on US releases...All well and good but not really needed(we don't have singles onalbums here in Factory-obsessives land!)as '5.8.6.' was the prototype for that single and justifies itself in terms of the album,it just fits with the whole tone.  <BR>My final comment would be this:this may well be the best New Order album.Recommendations don't come much higher...And bands don't come much better.
0790729628|3.0|I like the added scenes in the Dvd version, But It would have been a much better DVD, if they had added the original voice over movie. and also some extras. At some points I could see some dirt sections. like when you record a movie with your VCR.<BR>But who knows, maybe they will correct these mistakes, and release another DVD in the future, but if you are like many people who have all the different versions of the Star Wars Saga, I would buy it.
B00004LN16|3.0|I consider Stiff Upper Lip to be a good AC/DC album. It's not in the Back In Black or Highway To Hell league but it has some fine moments. The best track is Stiff Upper Lip as well as Safe In New York City, Satellite Blues and a great song called Give It Up. It falls away after that with some of the other songs, but all in all a good addition to the collection.
B00005UEAR|1.0|This double studio CD is the worst effort from Dream Theater I've seen.  You would be better off burning the 26 dollars you might spend on this.  The lyrics are poorly written and make tired subjects (even &quot;The Great Debate&quot;) seem even more tiresome.  The music on all of the tracks (except &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;) reeks of synthesized orchestral sounds used in only the most trite ways conceivable.  When the music does get away from the awful Trent-Gardner-esque synthesiser mess, it is merely a repetitive, goal-less rehash of the last few Dream Theater CDs.  And for Christ's sake, Portnoy lists himself as playing &quot;Lead Drums&quot; in the booklet.  Do yourself a favor, buy another copy of Awake and hope they never play any of this stuff live.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The movie itself is alright, a little too manufactured and even quite ridiculous at some points (especially the ending).  Though still entertaining.<br />The main problem is that the movie is spaced into 2 discs, very reminiscent of a Laser Disc flipping sides.  Everyone knows that DVDs can hold more than one movie easily, however the moron who edited this movie decided to place bonus materials on both discs, not leaving room for the entire movie on one, IDIOT!!!!<br />Rent it, its not worth owning like this, might as well end the movie half way through.
B00004W52U|5.0|Operation Ivy was by FAR the best ska/punk band ever. Coming out of the East Bay, they set the standard for what would come to be known as &quot;ska-core&quot;. Allthough they broke up in 1989, their influence can still be seen in bands like &quot;Suicide Machines&quot;, and Tim and Matt (Guitar and Bass) are now in the band &quot;Rancid&quot;. Their politically-aware lyrics combined with their fast melodies and an excellent bassline make for one of the best albums ever produced in ANY genre.
B00003CXA4|5.0|An epic film to be sure, but as noted by several reviewers already, does seem to gloss over many important areas.  My problem is that the end credits seem to fly in the face of the film's apparent message.  Candace (Murphy Brown) Bergen gets second billing (nearly equal to that of Ben Kingsley) for what was little more than a cameo appearance.  At best, it's an insult to a host of talented non-white actors who had much larger roles in the film; at worst, it shows the attitudes predictable of a white director and western production company.  They find it easy to praise a man like Gandhi, but in the end they've learned nothing.
B000001IQH|5.0|If someone asked me what &quot;punk&quot; was, I'd do no more than hand them this CD. Operation Ivy's latest reincarnation has it all. 3 chords on guitar, INCREDIBLE bass lines, inspired lyrics (although you can't make out just WHAT Tim's saying most of the time,) and the occasional ska influence make this CD one of my favorites. It's amazing how every song sounds different, when they're using the same 3 chords throughout the whole CD.
B00003CXI0|5.0|No matter what anyone says; I absolutely love this movie. I enjoy it so much, I can't stop thinking about it, wanting to go see it like every 10 seconds and what's worse... I've never had any interest in Harry Potter before! Well, if that doesn't say anything, then I don't know what will.<BR>Daniel Radcliffe is adorable in this movie and plays the role so bloody brilliant, it gives me the shivers!<BR>Seriously, this movie has got it all; it's got fantasy, excitement, tenderness and drama. All in one!! If you haven't seen it allready; be ashamed, be VERY ashamed, because it's that good, you have to see it AT LEAST once in the theatre!<BR>Well, I guess I made my point. And ehm... no comparisons with LOTR, because that's a total different genre and for opinions about that; you're on the WRONG PAGE! HARRY ROCKS!!!
B00003CXRP|5.0|Well, people go back and forth with negative to positive in their opinions of Cast Away - as probably with most movies - but I will actually go out on a limb and state that I cannot fathom why anyone in their right mind would not like (or love for that matter) this movie!!  I always enjoy Tom Hanks but that is beside the point with this gem.<br />The key is to place yourself as best as possible with Tom's character Chuck Noland.  I feel that his execution of emotions and reactions to his situation are exactly what you would expect to go through.  He is shocked, then confused, then lonely, then desperate, then content - and so on.<br />I came away from this movie with a much higher appreciation for life itself.  I appreciate the people and things I have in my life.  If you take the time to immerse yourself, just once, into this movie I am positive you will come away with at least a tinge of appreciation for some aspect of your life.<br />Gush gush - ya maybe - but sit back for about 15 minutes (or more if needed) and imagine yourself on an island all alone - for 4 years - you might find inspiration from Chuck and gratitude for such a fine movie having been produced.<br />Never boring and contains an ending that leaves your imagination wide open for possibilities, watch Cast Away now (then when it's over watch it again)  And give your volleyball a hug when you have a chance....
B000003TAR|5.0|I love this album.  It's kind of eery sounding.  All of the songs are good, but the ones that stand out are...<BR>Serve the Servants<BR>Heart-shaped Box<BR>Rape Me<BR>Frances Farmer<BR>Dumb<BR>Pennyroyal Tea<BR>All Apologies<BR>If you are a fan of Nirvana, or even just a fan of good rock music, buy this album.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Having grown up with the original Star Wars Trilogy, I found it hard to give this movie anything under 5 stars, but the plot was practically non-existant.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, however.  Ewan McGregor is excellent as a young Obi-Wan.  He perfectly portrays a young Jedi who is learning his ways.  The film is beautifully done, even if it is painfully obvious at times that CGI is happening.  Apart from the lack of a plot, the only other problem I had with this film was Jar-Jar Bink's character.  He was obviously added for young viewers' delight, but I found him tedious and juvinile.  This was an excellent film, however, and I highly recommend it for all Star Wars fans.
0783229526|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this film.With all the talent behind it,how could you not?I'm a big fan of anything different and original,but I have this weird,crazy problem with things that are insanely boring!The performances are top notch and the drug trips are somewhat entertaining,but even that wears off after about 30 minutes.After an hour I was just begging it to be over(like a bad acid trip)!But,nope...more scenes of knife wielding and drug hallucinations.This movie may be great if you're still living in the sixties or if drugs are the absolute center of your life,but I'll take a good story over a hit of ether any day!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|After watching this film in the theater, I couldn't wait for it come out on DVD.  It is fast-paced, beautiful, and amazingly put together.  The best way to describe Baz's style in this film is &quot;Impressionist&quot;.  He has a way of making all the scenes flow together beautifully while still keeping the basic plot going.  <BR>This movie is obviously a love story between Christian(Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman), both of whom play their roles perfectly.  McGregor gives his usual stellar performance, showing his chameleon-like acting abilities off to perfection.  Kidman shows a rare display of fun and lightness in her acting style.  I'd highly recommend this movie to anybody!
B00003CXXP|4.0|I don't really know what to make of this film. It looked fantastic, it kept me interested, but it was also very strange. There was indeed a certain feeling of \\"the ghost of Kubrick\\" co-directing, it reminded me of 2001 in a few respects, but at the same time it had the emotional feel of a Spielberg film steering most of the way....George Lucas might want to pay attention for the upcoming Star Wars episodes.
B00005JKOV|5.0|I don't even know how to begin!  This is one of the most amazing and profound films that I have ever seen!  Simply, I demand that you all go see it!  Never before have I been so bombarded with so many emotions from a single film.  Just wow!
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon collie and the infinite sadness is unusual, its eclectic and at times  a little trashy .It has that ephemeral quality of transcendence that makes you feel like you are continuously hearing a dirge in different parts of the  hemisphere, be it melodic, loud , country or pop. Billy corgans songwriting is exceptional on most of the songs and the music continuously keeps shifting. One of those albums you listen to on a day when you are comfortably numb from the daily banal static.
0446678430|3.0|Robert Kiyosaki, Talks about the different quadrant's. There is the self employed, the employee, the investor, and the business owner. I have read his books in the past getting to the investment and business owner Quadrant is next to impossible. I have read several books on real estate and theory is not always practical. Looking for distressed properties is just a feeding frenzy. There is so much competition For distressed properties the only way you can get them is to pay cash. I have been to the foreclosure auctions in Houston Texas and it is required that you bring at least (amount) in cash just to pickup 2 properties! Once you make it to the investment and business owner quadrant you Are set for life. The hard part is getting there. I have tried for the last six months, moved from a 3,000 square foot house to a small condo to have more money available to me for investments. Even working for investors and finding them houses hasn't worked out either. Unless you are looking for a long term investment and pay full retail for the house's I can't seem to get it to work. The theory behind it is great. Getting the theory to work is a whole different story.<br />I have also noticed that when you tell people you are a Real-Estate investor they demand to know your secrets (they don't ask) you would not believe how many people in Church have approached me wanting to know my secrets. The people that are in Real-Estate will do everything they can to sabotage your success, even people in my Church this seems to be true. If you are successful keep it a secret!
B00005OWEG|5.0|I'm not going to rehash the plot of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" here because God knows more knowledgeable critics than myself have done it before. Rather, I would like to offer a few general thoughts about the film as a whole, and then discuss specifically the \\"Redux\\" part of this disc.<br />First and foremost, if you haven't read \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Joseph Conrad, do yourself a favor and pick it up. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" stands on its own two feet as a work of art, but one does it short shrift if they don't explore its roots. In my opinion Coppola was astute enough to recognize that \\"Heart of Darkness\\" was well ahead of its time, and that, moreover, it proved an apt metaphor for the Vietnam conflict. By taking the swirling madness out of the novel, and adapting it to an entire country, he perfectly realized the borderline insanity that was that torturous war.<br />Secondly, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a powerful anti-war film, but it is also an intelligent one. Far too often, a stance against violence gets wrapped up in idealism. No sane person enjoys war, but there are many sane people who strive to carry it out professionally, and if at all possible, maintain their sanity at the same time. Coppola has stripped away the idealism, and shows combat in all its filthy, mind-numbing madness. He documents good people in awful situations. Who among us can rest assured that they wouldn't have cracked under similar circumstance? He makes an argument against war by showing what it does to decent people; it is the job of all of us not in the line of fire to assure that when we send our military into action it is for the right reasons.<br />Along the same lines, the theme of addiction to combat is explored to its utmost. Coppola clearly understands that a human being can hate what they are doing, but love what is being done to them at the same time. As the characters repeatedly face death, they only feel alive when they are in jeopardy; nothing else seems real. This is a subtle theme of the movie, but a very powerful one, if you are interested in exploring it further, I would highly recommend \\"My War Gone By, I Miss It So\\" by Loyd, and \\"Dispatches\\" by Herr.<br />Now for the 'Redux' part: this movie has never looked or sounded better. The film has been cleaned and scrubbed such that it is absolutely brilliant to watch. But it is the sound that really blew me away; I can honestly say that I have never heard a better encoded movie. Sitting in my living room I felt as if I was in the jungle; every drip, splash of rain, twang of a bullet and thwump of a rotor was right there. I really can't wait to watch it on some sultry July evening so I can really immerse myself in the film.<br />As for the added scenes, they were generally excellent. I particularly enjoyed the extra footage of Col. Kilgore, and especially an added scene with the Playboy Bunnies: I don't won't to give away the details, but it really paints a remarkable portrait of the dehumanizing nature of the war. Unfortunately, I found the most anticipated added scene, the French Plantation, to be rather disappointing. That's not to say that the acting or cinematography was sub-par, nothing could be further from the truth. I just felt that it interrupted the narrative flow of the movie. I understand that by injecting out of place normalcy into the movie Coppola was striving to make things even more surreal, but I just found it distracting.<br />Finally, the DVD (other than the added scenes) has no extra features. This isn't a bad thing per se, as I said earlier the movie stands on its own two legs. However, I would have very much liked it if the superb documentary \\"Heart of Darkness: The Making of Apocalypse Now\\" had been included. It is the definitive study of this movie, and provides remarkable insight into the often painful creation of this film. For those of you interested, it is available separately on DVD. Also, this is a film that begs for director/actor commentary.<br />Ultimately, these are smallcomplaints about a brilliant movie. If you haven't seen \\"Apocalypse Now\\" you should rectify that error ASAP. It is a brilliant movie that I find myself drawn to repeatedly and that always leaves me thinking. If you are already familiar with the film, you must treat yourself to this definitive edition.
0312965788|5.0|I got the set of all 4 of James Herriot's books in paperback when I was a teenager (a long time ago--okay!), and I have read them many times since. It is no exaggeration to say that in the darkest times of my life, these books have helped me to pull through. I could laugh and cry with the stories, lose myself and my problems for a while, and come out feeling somehow heartened and renewed. I always wished I had written Mr. Herriot to tell him this. Anyway, I recommend these books to everybody. They're fabulous stories that will crack you up and pull at your heartstrings. What more could anybody want? Herriot is a master storyteller, and the characters he creates are at once universal and unique. I defy anyone to read these and not be touched.

1587990717|3.0|If you have ever listened to economists, analysts, or other supposedly intelligent commentators and wondered is it just you or are they really talking complete rubbish, then this book is for you. Taleb has produced a witty, informed, and entertaining book that debunks much of what passes for analysis and success in financial markets.<br />Taleb has a clear admiration for Physics and adopts a physics approach. He dives right into the heart of the problem, finds the essential truth - that markets are random, the path we observe is only one of many, and that we cannot make proper assessments on trading strategies until a sufficient time-period has elapsed to give a significant sample which includes those rare but headline-making events that occur from time-to-time. He picks out several consequences of this phenomenon. The principal manifestation is Survivorship Bias (that those experiencing good fortune at picking the right investments will be elevated to guru status, until one of those rare but extreme events removes them from their pedestals). There are many other useful insights here; how the shorter the time-scale we use to study performance the more noise we see; how journalists comment on the one random outcome we observe and interpret it as significant news; how pseudo-science has spread to all sorts of unsuitable areas; and how groups of traders form collective opinions which defy rational analysis (the so-called \\"fire-station\\" effect); how lucky traders become all puffed-up with their own success, and the link to Seretonin levles and evolutionary benefits of being able to identify winners in competitions. This entertaining section gives compelling reasons for sharing Taleb's scepticism about much of the modern financial world.<br />Physics, however, has difficulty providing a complete explanation for any system more complex than a single particle. Real problems benefit from a more all-round approach, or a more heuristic analysis. Taleb's single parameter analysis of success in financial markets and the behaviour of participants and institutions soon runs into contradictions and problems. He frequently talks about \\"good traders\\" and \\"bad traders\\", but sees this only in terms of buying low-probability events which he insitst are universally undervalued, and gives pseudo-real case histories of bad traders who blew up buy selling these lo-probability events. Yet he also comes up with a list of distinguishing features of bad traders; so could a bad trader become self-aware and learn to become a good trader, but still sell low-frequency extreme events? Is anyone who buys extreme events a good trader? More analysis is needed here to give a water-tight case.<br />When discussing bubbles such as the recent tech-stock bubble, Taleb's single variable explanation misses a whole dynamic. Everyone knew it was a bubble that would burst, yet many made money from buying into it, and some who held out against going into it at lost their jobs. The mass-psychology  that sucks so many people into bubbles against their better judgement is a fascinating subject. There is much that can usefully be said, and now would be a good time to say it, but it isn't said here.<br />Elsewhere, Taleb's explanations also fail to enlighten as much as they might. The influence of randomness in medical research and medical practise is mentioned briefly, and the use of statistics in the legal profession gets a mention as well. There are many legal cases where statistical arguments have formed the basis of judgements and mis-judgements, from the Dreyfus case right up to the Sally Clark case in the UK today, yet all we get is a couple of throw away-examples from the O.J. Simpson trial. Perhaps if Taleb had spent less time reading high-society gossip pages and a bit more time researching his arguments he might have produced more significant arguments here.<br />Taleb has written a useful, readable, and thought-provoking book. Reading it is probably a better use ofyour commuting time than reading the Wall Street Journal. Yet the book ultimately disappoints because Taleb is neither original enough to fill an entire book with his musings and thoughts, nor diligent enough to give a properly researched presentation of his case.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Great exercise for those who like to think about the films they watch. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan whose original screenplay makes the audience feels just like Pearce's character, who knows what is going to happen, but not what happened in the moment before.
B000001FXT|5.0|Bob Marley didn't invent reggae, nor was he the first to record it, but on this album he showed us what reggae *really* is.  He recorded other fine albums in his life, but if you want to hear the essential Marley, this is it.

B000002KGT|4.0|To those who lived through this album's debut and popularity, it is a classic that represents a time in our lives. But hearing it recently on an in-flight 'rock channel,' I was pleased that musically it still holds up very well. Knowing the history of the album and its impetus in the strained relationships of some of the band members makes it that much more amazing. Fortunately for us, the sufferers penned songs instead of throwing things.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Really like this most songs on here are translated into english on B side.It consist of different sounds and instuments.Love it!
1573225517|5.0|It's pointless to try to provide a synopsis of this book as any effort would be misleading--it would sound stupid while utterly failing to convey the spirit and sense of the work.  Let's just say in Rob one every guy will see strong elements of his own character and every lady will immediately be able to relate Rob to no less than 50 guy's she's known in her life.<br />Rob may be something of an immature loser, but his world view, aspirations and general \\"muddling-through\\" lifestyle epitomizes all guys at some point in their lives.  his constant ratings of this, that and the next eloquently render one's late teen-early adult years way of looking at the world. (Remember the \\"is she nice looking?'  \\"I'd give her a 7.5 on a scale of 10\\" days???)<br />The book is a funny, quirky, funny, sympathetic, funny, articulate & funny social commentary of the state of men--past, present and yet to be.  <br />Highly recommended.

0140186409|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath was I great book in my opinion. It's the story of Tom Joad, out of prison and finds that his family is moving because they will push their house over because they cant afford it. Tom meets a former preacher Jim Casy and finds his parents. They head over to California picking up the Wilsons. This book showed me the Depression better than any history book could. I like the message it sent. I lke the former preacher's message of we can only believe in each other. And of course you probably know the famous speech from Tom Joad (...I'll be there&quot;). It was great, I read it during winter break of 2001-2002 in a week. Not at all boring in my opinion.
B00005A46T|4.0|I really liked Slipknot's first album, because it represented a new, different sound (and face) of modern American metal.  There are few bands out there that can match Slipknot's sheer volume potential, and the speed and drumming displayed by this band is phenomenal.<br />But this album seems less essential than the first.  I think they tried too hard to upset parents here...not that that's a bad thing for all people, but I don't live with my parents.  Don't get me wrong, I like the record okay, but I think there is less of a focus to this record than there was on the first one, particularly in terms of lyrics and musicality.  I really liked the songs &quot;Left Behind,&quot; &quot;Disasterpiece,&quot; and &quot;The Heretic Anthem.&quot;<br />I'm aware that it's no longer cool to like Slipknot, now that they're popular, but that fact is irrelevant.  If you liked the first album, or are just a fan of fast, loud, angry metal music, go ahead; I'm sure you'll like Iowa.
089898890X|5.0|I have progressed very quickly by using this book alone!  It has been laid out in such a way as to start from the very basics of a simple swing beat and then takes the reader up to the very complex syncopated rhythms.  The most important thing to note regarding the book is that it is laid out to advance the student at a VERY quick pace.  And since it comes with an audio CD you can 'hear' what is written on the page.  There is also five songs that do not have a drum track so the student can play along.  For [money] I have at LEAST one year of drum lessons!!!  The author not only explains WHAT to play but WHY and also WHEN.  The book teaches you not only how to be a good drummer, but also, how to be a good musician.  A perfect drum book!!!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The soundtrack to moulin rouge is one of the best. If you loved the movie, then you will love the soundtrack. Not only does, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sound great but they have every song in the movie. You will love this soundtrack!!
B00000ILBK|3.0|If this wasn't a Star Trek film, I would have given it only 1 star.  It is pretty basic stuff, nothing spectacular.  There are a lot of scenes played for laughs, and the first time I saw it in theaters I laughed out loud at some of it.  Unfortunately the comedy doesn't hold up on subsequent viewings.  An enjoyable enough film if you're into Star Trek, especially the Next Generation, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.

B00005RZV4|5.0|The title for this album comes from The Great Below, a song off NIN's most recent studio album, 1999's The Fragile.  Some, like myself, were less than thrilled with the direction this album took after NIN's 1994 masterpiece, The Downward Spiral.  Even though I've purchased every halo release thus far, I thought Nine Inch Nails has been heading downhill the last couple of years.<br />Then I heard this live album.  And All That Could Have Been is absolutely the best live album I've ever heard, hands down.  Here is the first time we have ever been presented with such a vast spectrum of Trent Reznor's back catalog, and it is simply breathtaking.  We are presented with songs from Pretty Hate Machine, (with drums, even!  They sound perfect...Terrible Lie is, in my opinion, better than the original! Sin and Head Like a Hole are also represented here) Broken, (a killer album whose ferocity is perfectly conveyed on stage--we get to hear Gave Up, Wish, and Suck) The Downward Spiral, (the \\"pig\\" medley--March of the Pigs and Piggy are played here, along with Closer, and the album's closer, Hurt) and The Fragile.  Are all represented pretty equally and each are equally mind-blowingly good live.<br />My favorite tracks here are Gave Up (absolutely killer track), Piggy (I don't know how Trent manages to get his voice to sound the way it does in the last few minutes), and The Great Below.<br />Whether you're a NIN fan or not, you will be if you listen to this album...it's absolutely incredible.
B000056H24|1.0|Now I know why this movie was nicknamed 'The Slowest Story Ever Told'. The only thing I particularly liked was Alfred Newman's great music score. He cleverly uses bits form Handel's Messiah and Verdi's Requiem and composes a Bach-like music that caries much of the picture through it's dullest moments.<br />I think all the scenes could have done in half the time and I think that would've given a likeable movie. But not this way.<BR>I got bored and my legs sored at the end.
B000002UAC|5.0|Of all the Fabs' albums, I've come to appreciate With The Beatles the most compared to when I first heard it.  Maybe it's because it's got a melange of the elements that made the Beatles a reckoning force in the 1960's.  There's the usual skiffle-influence, Motown covers, and a nod to the dawn of rock and roll, so quite a mix there.  It's goes further than Please Please Me in that it is more upbeat, and if one thinks about it, Please Please Me had a strong opening and closing tunes, while the rest was slow to mid-paced.<br />Fast-paced songs like &quot;It Won't Be Long,&quot; &quot;All My Loving,&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; are classic Beatles in the same vein as &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand.&quot;  The Ringo-sung &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; is also done by that other titanic musical force in the 1960's--The Rolling Stones.<br />Paul's cover of &quot;Till There Was You&quot; shows why he's the most effective of the four at singing ballads.  He doesn't get to sing much here--only three songs.<br />Then there's the number of cover songs.  Face it, they would cover songs during their early days with decreasing frequency, through Help!  The three Motown covers are standouts:  &quot;Please Mr. Postman,&quot; &quot;Money,&quot; and &quot;You Really Got A Hold On Me,&quot; this last by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles being my favorite cover here.  I have to give credit to John Lennon for that.<br />George Harrison covers Chuck Berry's &quot;Roll Over Beethoven,&quot; and this adds to the late 50's influence felt on their early albums.  He sings three songs here, a great number compared to the number he sings in their later albums.<br />The Barrett Strong number &quot;Money,&quot; which benefits greatly from John Lennon's strong lead vocal, was later performed on the Josie And The Pussycats soundtrack and is the song performed in Empire Records, though it didn't make it on the soundtrack.  The song still echoes throughout our psyche:  &quot;Money, that's what I want.&quot;  Who doesn't, eh?s what I want.&quot;  Who doesn't, eh?

B00005R87Q|4.0|The Fast and the Furious may not win any awards, but it is a good movie if all you want is a diversion fron the \\"real world.\\"  The movie has awesome cars, sexy stars, and action.  A popcorn flick, that's great for anyone.  This movie has no real actual plot, but it fufills it's purpose of being an action movie that's easy on the mind.  Just watch it for a fun time.
B000000993|5.0|In the years since Undertow, no band has ever successfully imitated Tool's sound or ideology, but that's not to say that none ever tried.  The last album with original bassist Paul D'Amour focuses more on the guitar-based rock of Tool of yore, rather than the quieter, prettier, more manipulated, deadlier-sounding emotional progressive metal they're writing these days.  Maynard Keenan provides vocals ranging from a whisper to a guttural scream, and Adam Jones, Paul, and Danny Carey do their best to keep up.  This is also probably their most radio-friendly and accessible recording, lacking the 9- and 10-minute dirges and bizarre instrumental noise-tracks of later masterpieces Aenima and Lateralus. <br />Standout tracks here include Prison Sex, Flood, Sober, and Bottom.  If you're a fan of Tool's later work, you may or may not like this album, but if you're a fan of Tool's later work, it's probably because you were already a fan of Undertow.

0792156684|1.0|Spectacularly bad - indifferently acted, poorly plotted, and narratively incoherent (the film is told from Rose's point of view, yet she consistently relates events she was not privy to and cannot have been aware of).  Cameron trivializes an awful tragedy, reducing it to mere background for a halfwitted (and anachronistic) love story.  I can't believe I let my wife drag me to see this turkey.  (To her credit, she hated it too.)
0060975768|5.0|I waited four years before I finally picked up a copy in a used bookstore, by chance, a hard cover first edition. I devoured it over the next week. I didn't want to finish it too quickly. Instead, I wanted to savor it. Even after all this time, the book still resonates with me.<BR>General Moore's book will remain a classic of not only Vietnam, but of infantry warfare. That the book has drawn comparisons to some of the greatest books ever written about warfare and warriors should surprise no one who has read it and it is certainly deserving of them. It's tone is mournful, sad, and the General still is in awe of those heroes who went with him into the Ia Drang. Anyone whoever doubts the fighting ability and dedication of the American soldier (even if it's in a place as morally ambiguous as Vietnam) should read this book and thank God that this country is so blessed to have such young men who make such sacrifices.<br />General Moore, I salute you and the heroes you have lead. God Bless.
B0000041DF|4.0|These are very interesting recordings of two of the great Romantic piano concertos. They are both very fast recordings (though contrary to the editorial review, not as fast as Horowitz's seminal recordings with either Reiner or Barbirolli). Martha Argerich plays like a woman possessed which at times appears lacking in sensitivity or control. For instance, the chordal cadenza of the 1st movement of the Rachmaninoff sounds clumsy, and the flashy pianistic climax of the finale of the Tchaikovsky feels overly rushed. However, there are times, especially in the finale of the Rachmaninoff and the intermezzo of the Tchaikovsky, during which her style works wonderfully and shows unparalleled virtuosity. Overall the recordings are very satisfying, despite occasional mistakes and lapses in timing between the piano and orchestra. However, I have mentioned Vladimir Horowitz and I simply cannot recommend these recordings above his performances with Reiner (Rachmaninoff) and Toscanini (Tchaikovsky in the legendary War Bond concert). As an addition to those recordings though, this CD is a fine purchase.
B00005QK3W|4.0|I must say that I enjoyed much of this CD.  I have to summarize as saying it has some of his most raw moments that rival things on the white album.  I do think the sore throat he admitted to suffering from prior to starting these recordings hindered his vocals and a bit more care should have been put in doing them.  With nothing to prove I applaud him for continuing to make new music and as we have now lost 2 of the Beatles, these may be the near to or last recordings of any Beatle.  That thought alone makes me approach this CD with gratitude and yes, respect.<br />A run down of the songs:<br />1. Lonely Road - A good opener, solid bass lines, a dark mood and a Paul who means what he is singing here.  It sizzles.<br />2. From A Lover To A Friend - Pleasant, not my favorite as there is a slight maudlin quality to the melody and the voice wobbles a bit, but it is not a bad listen.<br />3. She's Given Up Talking - This doesn't do much for me but the bridge is cute and it grows on you.<br />4. Driving Rain - I liked it.  The flack made about the lyrics doesn't hold with me.  Remember, the Beatles did All Together Now with a similar simplicity of lyrics and everyone thought it was great.  The tune is fresh and I liked the delivery, a fun song.<br />5. I Do - A charmer.  Melodically, simple yet memorable, a solid song.  Paul does select to up the vocal an octave after the first chorus with mixed results but this could be straight out of 1965.  Very nice.<br />6. Tiny Bubble - Has it's moments, it has an understated funky approach but I tended to skip the track upon later hearings<br />7. Magic - I loved this song.  Again, songful, classic McCartney singing about the moment he met Linda.  Nice lyrics to match good material and a good performance.<br />8. Your Way - Another catchy, almost countryish tune that harkens back to simpler times.  Enjoyable.<br /> 9. Spinning On An Axis - Nice tune, not at the top for me but it has some good moments.<br />10. About You - The Rocker on the CD!  It explodes from the speakers and Paul effectively raises his voice to the wondrous falsetto he use to pull off.  This to me had a White Album feel to it with rocking guitars, explosive vocals and the lyrics pack punch.<br />11. Heather - Gorgeous.  Lovely piano, builds upon a simple but infectious rhythm and melodic figure.  By the time the vocals come in, you realize this one has been recorded with care and could have appeared on any number of Beatle albums.  One of my personal favorites.<br />12. Back In The Sunshine Again - Rough edged blusey number, vocals give out a bit at the end, but it is certainly not cute and that makes it refreshing.<br />13. Your Loving Flame - Wow, if this is not as good as Maybe I'm Amazed then I don't know what else the man can do.  Stirring melody and emotional release.  Put this and flip side it with About You 20 years ago and it's number one.  The radio simply WILL NOT play anything new by Paul these days and it is a loss.<br />14. Riding Into Jaipur - Quirky, ode to George type experimental track that is a delight.<br />15. Rinse The Raindrops -  This is the one track I wish was either kept off or reduced in length.  Some nice effects with strings at the end, some interesting changes but overall a long disappointment for me.  One of the reasons I can't give this 5 stars.  Some seem to like it however.<br />16. Freedom - Solid closer that grows on you with its simplicity.  A great message simple but direct and Paul is doing it live and in great voice.<br />So, if you like Paul and the Beatles, get this one.

6304493681|4.0|I pick out this movie because i wanted to have a good anime movie, but i didnt know what to buy so i pick up one at random. The first time I saw this movie I didnt understand a few things(like what a \\"ghost\\" was). But then i checked out the definitions of everthing that they mention in the movie from the DVD extras. Then i figured out that a ghost is suppose to be the thing that makes you human no madder what. <BR>    So the movie is kind of confusing if your not smart(which im not)but other than that the movie is a good one. The animation is one of the best I have ever seen. I especialy like how the blood squirts all over the place when someone gets shot and how when someone shoots a gun whatever the bullets hit it makes craters in it and the object just gets blown away.<BR>   This is definitly the movie to buy if your looking for a good anime movie and i think this is one you will watch over and over again.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Let go of your preconceived expectations of Prince. This album is nothing like he's ever attempted before. Aside from Hip Hop, when Prince goes into stylistic explorations he has never attempted he always succeeds. The Rainbow Children is no exception. <br />From the very first few notes of the title track any long time Prince fan can right away decipher that this album is going to be different from all the rest of his career, partly because of the arrangements of these songs, and the myriad Jazz inflections. The coda at the end of the the title track is a gorgeous blend of electric guitar, bass, Fender Rhodes, real drums, and subtle flute by Najee.<br />When Prince undertakes most (and sometimes all) of the instruments himself on his albums it's a beautiful thing. That's no exception here, where he performs every instrument on all the songs, except: drums, bass on 2 songs (\\"The Work pt. 1\\" and \\"The Last December\\" - Larry Graham) and horns. That's right, this is NOT a band performing on the album, not the NPG as some have said in their reviews - it's mostly Prince.<br />The production and performances are truly stellar. For those who say it's overproduced, that's not true at all. I'm a music engineer/musician and this is the most organic sounding album of Prince's career. It's earthy, warm and crystal clear.<br />The music is inspired and focused like we haven't heard Prince in ages! The sound of the Fender Rhodes dominates most of the album, and that is a welcome new wrinkle to his arsenal, considering he is highly underrated on the keys and hasn't really done much work with a Rhodes keyboard on his albums.<br />In some of the songs there is a visceral gospel vocal feel to the choruses, as in the title track, \\"Last December,\\" \\"The Everlasting Now\\" and \\"Everywhere\\", where the polyrhythmic feel and Blackwell's drumming is a thing of beauty. Sure, for those extremely sensitive to spiritual/religious content, this album will probably come across as \\"preaching\\", but I don't feel he is preaching. He comes across as stating his views and beliefs, which is what every artist does, whether the content is spiritual or not. He has sung about sexually explicit themes, yet now all of a sudden some people can't get over the fact that he's not doing that anymore, so this is hard to take. That's rich. Prince has matured, his long time fans should mature too.<br />But don't fret, there is ferocious guitar on TRC, there is pretty guitar on TRC, there is also some of the most elegant music of Prince's career. \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\" is a pure delight in its soaring simplicity. One of the most majestic ballads he's ever produced. \\"Wedding Feast\\" is a perfectly executed tongue in cheek ditty, and it's comic relief in its lyrical content, while lasting less than 60 seconds.<br />Aside from the title track and \\"Wedding Feast,\\" \\"Digital Garden\\" is a song that is probably the least Prince-like, and you wish it would last longer than it does. There is subtlety and nuance in every nook and cranny of this album. \\"1+1+1 Is 3\\" harkens back to the quirky Funk in the 80s that Prince was so nimble at. If it doesn't make you get up and dance you're probably unconscious.<br />After 20+ albums, after almost 25 years in the music industry and at the age that most musicians would discontinue trying new things, Prince has returned to form by flipping the switch to challenge himself AND his audience lyrically and musically, something he did with regularity at the peak of his popularity. <br />This is not a Pop album. This is everything that Pop music is not. Don't let the fact that because there is no mainstream media hyping this album (which is not pushed by a major label) lead you to believe that this is just another in a string of substandard Prince albums. The new mellinium and lack of a contractual agreement hovering over him (his Warner/Chappel music publishing deal) have renewed Prince's spirit.<br />This is not the cotton candy you'll hear on the radio, it's like Mom's cooking back home. If you like challenging music, performed with skill, passion and authority The Rainbow Children is for you. It's the kind of Prince album that makes you wonder what he's going to do next. A brilliant return to form. This is the real Prince.
B0000009WC|5.0|Did a vehicle come from somewhere out there? If it did they were playing Inca Roads on their spacey CD thingy. Far and away the best of the beast and makes toast of the most. How could anything else sound good after this.<BR> If you want just one Frank Zappa album, you're crazy. But if you ARE crazy, &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; should fit neatly into your collection. In the genius section. <BR> Sometimes I swear that some of the stuff they do on this CD is impossible. It's just so good!
0345413377|4.0|I think that this book was so, so, awesome. I have read The Golden Compass and that seems to revolve around Lyra(love that name), the girl in the book, her \\"golden compass\\", and her history, life, and world. The second, The Subtle Knife, is mostly about Will's life, his going through worlds, and acceptance of the subtle knife. <br />    I REALLY wish that Mr. Pullman had written more books, because they kind of leave you hangin at the end, just saying \\"Ok, now lets build the republic of Heaven.\\" and end of book. And also with Will and Lyra's     relationship, \\"Right, let's meet every year, in our seperate worlds, at this same bench, so we can still always be together, even if we're all grown up.\\"  <br />      My favorite book of the whole series is the Subtle Knife, because of all the suspense with the power of the knife, and what Will and Lyra do with it. I like the way with all of the books they switch from what one person is doing to another with each chapter.<br />P.S. READ LORD OF THE RINGS,ITS GREAT!
6304493681|4.0|I pick out this movie because i wanted to have a good anime movie, but i didnt know what to buy so i pick up one at random. The first time I saw this movie I didnt understand a few things(like what a \\"ghost\\" was). But then i checked out the definitions of everthing that they mention in the movie from the DVD extras. Then i figured out that a ghost is suppose to be the thing that makes you human no madder what. <BR>    So the movie is kind of confusing if your not smart(which im not)but other than that the movie is a good one. The animation is one of the best I have ever seen. I especialy like how the blood squirts all over the place when someone gets shot and how when someone shoots a gun whatever the bullets hit it makes craters in it and the object just gets blown away.<BR>   This is definitly the movie to buy if your looking for a good anime movie and i think this is one you will watch over and over again.
6300182355|3.0|Sam J. Jones and Melody Anderson are Flash and Dale Arden in this now 20+ year old re-make of the famous series.  In this version, Flash, a NY Jets quarterback, shares a flight with Dale, which is forced to crashland because of bad weather.  Unbeknownst to just about everybody, the bad weather is actually being caused by the evil Ming, the emperor of the planet Mongo (and just about any other place having a population sentient enough to fear being blasted to atoms).  The only person who seems to know what&#8217;s going on is former NASA scientist Haim Zarkov (Chaim Topol), whose now a certified mad-scientist (with the home-made rocketship to prove it).  When Flash and Dale stumble out of the wreck of their plane and into Zarkov&#8217;s lab, he kidnaps both of them, forcing them to fly into space with him.  Landing on the exotic world of Mongo, they find an empire composed of planets ruled by Ming out of fear and a mutual hatred of each other.  Surviving his execution, Flash has less than a day to unite the warring factions of Mongo against Ming, save Dale from becoming Ming&#8217;s latest conquest and save the Earth.<BR>This movie is sort of a treat, but it&#8217;s no more than that with its thin plot and (now cheesy) FX.  It&#8217;s fun because the flick is actually faithful to the original, both in its artwork (which captures the 1940&#8217;s feel with riveted spaceships that look inspired by WWII bombers) and its casting: the original Flash Gordon pitted the pure-white and American hero against a dubious assortment of alien (actually foreign) powers bent on imperialistic expansion and the acquisition of American women.  In the new film, both Gordon and Arden seem alone in their north American accents (Anderson is actually Canadian), beset by villains with British or Italian accents.  If the action is lame (even Dale, armed with a lasergun, can dispatch Ming&#8217;s soldiers by the dozen) and the FX ditto (the sound effects seem ripped-off from &#8220;Barbarella&#8221;), the casting provides a lot of fun &#8211; especially Brian Blessed as Vultan, the Hawkman King (coincidentally, his character had the most fun in the original serials), Ornella Muti as Aura, Ming&#8217;s lusting daughter and Mariangela Melato, unrecognizable from her role as the concquered castaway capitalist from &#8220;Swept Away&#8221; (1975) who as Ming&#8217;s general brings out the fun of lines like &#8220;dispatch war-rocket Ajax to bring back his body!&#8221;  There's also a strange though appreciated cameo by Rocky Horror vet Richard O'brien as a flute-playing subject of Prince Barron.  The film lacks for better effects, but something along the lines of the violence of Star Wars would ruin the look (&#8220;Raiders&#8221;, which proved you could go back to the old serials with plenty of modern visceral excitement, was still a year away).  The film is best when it&#8217;s suggestive &#8211; like when the strapped down Aura faces torture with the dreaded &#8220;bore worms&#8221;; or when Ming first uses his ring on Dale, bringing out a submissive side unparralled by any woman, even &#8211; as the evil Klytus notes &#8211; the emperor&#8217;s own daughter.  Now, how would they know?  I suggest getting the DVD with its widescreen and all of that gorgeous viewing.
B00000K0DV|3.0|I have to say that if you want to see Fulci's masterpiece, check out the Beyond (before you see this). There just isn't much gore here. However, lots of hot girls get naked and get it on. I was surprised at the amount of sex scenes, which is what saved it from a 2 star rating. The killer's duck voice is very funny , but I found the amount of bloodshed dissapointing. Only a few good scenes of cutting up girls. If you are a gore hound I would suggest looking elsewhere.
B000002OX7|5.0|Hands down, this is easily the band's best piece of work.  &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; were more of a &quot;conceptual&quot; experience and less of a musical experience (just one person's opinion, of course).  &quot;Who's Next&quot;, on the other hand, is classic from start to finish.  Roger Daltrey should thank his lucky stars every day that he had Pete Townshend (and to a far lesser degree, John Entwistle) in his life.  A rich voice notwithstanding, Daltrey could never be put in the same class with other great front men like Mick Jagger, Steven Tyler, Robert Plant, or Jim Morrison.  A lead singer with zero composing skill is the equivalent of a musical transient who is utterly dependent upon others to make something of him.  Fortunately for Daltrey, Townshend's songwriting &amp; guitar prowess covers the penless vocalist's backside BIG TIME here!  There simply isn't a weak moment, from start to finish, in the original track lineup on this album.  From the pounding melodies &amp; percussion of &quot;Baba O'Reily&quot; through Townshend's sonic blast-off of &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, this set is absolutely timeless.  Bassist Entwistle deserves great props as well with his penned contribution, &quot;My Wife&quot;..........a bottom-heavy steamroller of a tune about a fornicating husband on the run (an infectious horn section in the track adds a great funky touch to the rock'n'roll thunder!).  Other great melodies (&quot;The Song is Over&quot;, &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;) and rousing rock classics (&quot;Bargain&quot;) help make &quot;Who's Next&quot; required material for any fan of classic rock.  A definite Must-Have!  Thank you, Mr. Townshend!!
0380002930|5.0|I highly recommend this novel.  It is very interesting!! A must have.  The anthropomophized rabbits show basic human characteristics that are required for their survival.  They overcome many problems that they meet throughtout their journey.
B000002W9P|5.0|Helloween is known for they're speed metal and this album just rules. This in my opinion is the bands best album to ever be released. The cd is great from start to finish and is a definet classic. One thing I really like about Helloween is they have some elements of Iron Maiden in them but in a quicker style. The song &quot;Halloween&quot; is my favorite on the album and it tops the 3 minute mark. The starts off slow and then kicks in to some amazing guitar work and great vocals by Michael Kiske. Another song I really like on the album is &quot;Future World&quot; and it is just one of those songs that makes you happy when listening to it. Definetly some of Helloweens best work and great efforts by all of the band members. This album is a true classic. I haven't heard part 2 yet but I plan on getting that real soon. I am hoping it can do just as good or even better than this album. Helloween will always be one of my heavy metal favorites and this album will always be lingering around the top of my list. I definetly recommend it to any 80's Metal fan especially if you like bands like Queensryche, Raven, and Accept I think you will like this stuff.
B000002J0B|5.0|Everybody has their personal favorite Zep album.........and while my first choice would still probably be Vol. IV (it's awfully hard to do without &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;), I do believe that &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; is their strongest work from start to finish.  &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;, &quot;Over The Hills And Far Away&quot;, &quot;Dancin Days&quot;, &quot;D'yer Mak'r&quot; &amp; &quot;The Ocean&quot; are classics.  &quot;No Quarter&quot; is a haunting track that showcases some great keyboard work from John Paul Jones.  And I love &quot;The Crunge&quot;-----a funky derivative of an old James Brown tune.       There are &quot;heavier&quot; albums (Vol. I &amp; &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;), and those with more commercial appeal (Vol. II, Vol. IV), but I think &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; is musically the best.  Buy it!!
B00000263T|5.0|Released in 1985 this album is a heavy metal classic.  Accept is one of the most unique power metal bands of the 80's and are well known for they're great music but if you ask me this album is they're best right next to &quot;Balls To The Wall&quot;. I like all 10 songs on this album and my 3 favorite are &quot;Metal Heart&quot;, &quot;Screaming For A Love-Bite&quot;, and &quot;Living For Tonight&quot;. Udo Dirkschneider does some of his best vocals ever on this album. This album was well put together and belongs in the hands of any true 80's metal fan.
B000008M54|5.0|Love the music here. The reason I bought this, was because I wanted &quot;Fisherman's Blues&quot;, which was a song on the soundtrack of &quot;Waking Ned Devine&quot;, the great little movie on winning the lottery in Ireland! Fisherman's Blues is a great tune, and come to find out, so is the rest of the cd. It's got some great stuff on it, and I am very pleased.
B00005U1YO|4.0|Funky grooves, thundering bass beds, and a heaping helping of that Chemical ingenuity we've all come to know and love are the ingredients that have been lovingly mixed into \\"Come With Us,\\" the Chemical Brothers' latest bake.  While die-hard fans may have been patiently expecting something a little more in line with their earlier releases, \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\" and \\"Exit Planet Dust,\\" the brothers have apparently opted to continue in the vein of 1999's stunning \\"Surrender,\\" mixing house, trance, and big-beat grooves with a pop sensibility and musicality that is, as of yet, unrivaled in the electronica genre.  Of particular note is the down-tempo track, \\"The State We're In,\\" featuring vocals by Beth Orton, and the epic dance anthem, \\"Star Guitar.\\"  So if you're looking for immense soundscapes, catchy leads, and an infectious groove that finds its home on or off the dance-floor, consider your wish granted.
B000001IPL|5.0|THe bEst GOd Damn Offspring Cd you will Buy
B00004Z459|5.0|I would probably have bought this cd for $30 instead of $15 but hey I got a great deal. It was on repeat for about 2 months in my player and not only do i still listen to it every so often the lyrics would always get suck in my head and i wouldnt mind. And everyone knows that when a song  gets in your head thats annoying but if it doesnt annoying you thats fantastic. So with beats like Limp Bizkit and lyrics that cant compare to anything this is one CD everyone should own or at least give it a try. Warning if you hate loud rock music probably not for you.
B00005R87Q|4.0|The Fast and The Furious is a hot, action (car racing) film which combines fast street car racing and hot women. The plot I did not quite understand and wasn't that clearly developed. Brian, an undercover cop in L.A. races as one of the street racers t and tries to see if the gang of racers have stolen car engines and other car supplies from hijacked trucks. The racing is hot, the women are hot, the acting not terribly great but ok. This is mainly a movie for teens and young adults, I don't think many older folks would like this flick.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Unlike Pink's last CD which was mostly R&amp;B she has grown. It's a rock, rap, R&amp;B record with less R&amp;B then her last. She is talking about real stuff in her songs. Divorce, Patriouism, being Misunderztood. Its a great CD for any girl. At first you may not enjoy it or at least i didnt but the songs grow on you. if your looking for a different kind of sound this is it. Unlike her first released song &quot;Get The Party Started&quot; no other songs are like it on the album. Its more rock and real life songs that i really enjoy listening to at least 6 times a week.
B00005B4GU|5.0|i'm at a loss for words. this album...it's...incredible. if i play it in public places, everyone goes into a type of orgasmic overload. it's just that good. i implore you to get some money, even if you have to shake down some old lady on the street, and purchase this album. then go home, put on headphones, turn the volume up as loud as you can stand and enjoy. when it's over, you'll be a better person, and you'll want to listen to it again.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I learned my lesson and will no longer buy DVD's based<BR>on reviews likely put out by the filmaker themselves.<BR>This movie was predictible, short, and left you hanging<BR>at the end. It seemed to end before it started. The \\"monster\\"<BR>was a joke. The characters were all poor actors. The stupid<BR>\\"Jeepers Creepers\\" song made no sense to me and was only a tie <BR>to the final scene.<BR>Stay away from this movie. If you want frights watch \\"What lies<BR>beneath\\" with the lights out. <BR>The producer should save his money and not make the sequel to<BR>this trash.
B000002C1W|5.0|This is a great Pink Floyd effort. The lyrics, melodies, rhythms and arrangements are probably among the band's three best, and yes, there is no Roger Waters anywhere to be found.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I like very much all the albums of DT (they are all great) and know some side projects as well. I think Scenes From a Memory was one of the bests :-) but this new album is HIGH above all!!!<BR>This is very different from previous albums in music for me. Some fans will need a new approach to understand it. It's much more than rock. It's very colorful, it has much kind of mood and music. I've found 20th century \\"modern\\" music, classical music, musical, symphonic rock, heavy metal, jazz rock and Chick Corea as well in it. This is what I needed! This album cannot be mentioned on the same day with the others. Professional performace at the highest level like never before. I become extatic, euphoric, catartic every time I listen it. MUSIC, MUSIC EVERYWHERE! If you like MUSIC, you MUST buy it!
B000056K04|1.0|Of course, like millions of DMB fans, i was extremely dissapointed with EVERYDAY.  I've turned to DMB my entire life to escape this crap bubble-gum pop, because they didn't seem afraid to have 3 minute long music solos, entirely suggestive lyrics, and odd yet pefect vocals.  i was trying to comfort myself by saying that they would soon get over this horribly sold out rut, but after reading that the change wasn't because of musical revolutions, but a change in producers, then the bands future began to look dull.  Dave matthews lyrics, which were once amazing 7 minute long metaphorical poems, have been dumbed down to songs which mean nothing.  \\"I did it,\\" i mean, what the hell is that.  So all i can to now is hope they will hear the millions of cries, and change, but until then, i will listen to the phenominal UNDER THE TABLE AND DREAMING, BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS, AND CRASH.  sorry Dave, but you've killed your career.
0887307396|5.0|This book is a great example of a useful business book. The authors back up all of their findings with solid data and they write it in such a way that it can be read in one sitting. Along with Good to Great, by James Collins, this book is one of the premier business books of the new century. Relevant and informative, I can't say enough good things. As a business owner, it is so refreshing to see a book that realizes the value of a stable team of executives and the importance of strong business-wide values. Please buy this book and create value with your business.
B00005U122|4.0|I enjoy Pink Floyd tremendously,so I have been looking forward to their DVD. I have Pink Floyd Pulse vhs tape which I have watched a great number of times,a joyous concert. In The Flesh is far below the standards set in Pulse.The light show is not there,the three awesome female singers are not there (although there are three female singers), the joy the energy is saddly not there.It is though a concert and not like alot of \\"music DVDs\\" that have only a few minutes of music and hours of interviewing grade school teachers who remember the pranks the band members did when in 5th grade. I would buy it again but Pulse so much better.So if you love \\"In The <BR>Flesh\\",which seems to be the general concensus,you must buy Pulse(vhs)you will be blessed and comfortably numb.
B000002J2B|4.0|\\"Wind and Wuthering,\\" was the last Genesis album before guitarist Steve Hackett left the fold.  It also marks the end of their art rock period. Songs with titles like \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" and \\"Unquiet Slumber for the Sleepers\\" are typical of the kind of long, drawn out sonic mush that Genesis was known for in the 70s. However, the reletively peppy \\"Your Own Special Way,' was indicative of where the band was heading. Even though it clocks in at over six minutes in length, you can hear the roots of future Genesis hits like \\"Follow You, Follow Me,\\" \\"Misunderstanding,\\" and \\"No Reply at All\\" in it.<br />Overall, \\"Wind ans Wuthering\\" is a decent Genesis album, as most of them are. If you're a fan of their 80s pop stuff, however, you might not like it as much.
0425074811|3.0|This book has a broad reach of topics all loosely centered on ancient contact with extraterrestrial beings.  While there are many examples, there are few that have any detail.  This can leave you hanging as you read about astronomical computers in the time of Christ or a metal monument in India that doesn't show signs of aging.<br />The author also shows a nearly breathless anticipation of the future in flatly stating that manned craft will reach Mars no later than 1986 and in predicting bases on the moon.  And then he gets really crazy by stating that it's not really a big problem to predict the economy of a country the size of Mexico for the next 50 years.<br />This book provides a good introduction to many unexplained mysteries...just don't look to it for answers.
B00001ZULV|4.0|Calling this album &quot;The Hits&quot; rather than &quot;The Best of Genesis&quot; was a wise move.  Compiling any single disc of Genesis's best material, going all the way back to their Peter Gabriel-led dark ages, would never satisfy either fans of their old art-rock days or fans of their modern incarnation as pop icons.  Having said that, &quot;The Hits&quot; is still far from complete.  Missing are great Genesis singles like &quot;No Reply at All,&quot; &quot;Illegal Alien,&quot; &quot;Man on the Corner&quot; and &quot;Paperlate.&quot;  The album also contains a couple of tracks from their recent album without Phil Collins, which would just as well be forgotten.  The new version &quot;Carpet Crawlers,&quot; one of their best songs from the Gabriel days, is a nice inclusion.<br />Overall, this is a strangley programmed and sequenced greatest hits album.  It is mostly useful for casual fans who own few, if any, of the original albums.
B000021XR5|5.0|Any true music lover (and anyone who has actually listened to the whole CD) would have to agree on a 4 star or greater rating on this one. I'll go with 5 as I have developed an utter addiction to this album. With an excellent kickstart such as &quot;Down&quot; and a wind-down tune like &quot;Atlanta,&quot; all bases are covered. My first favorite on the album was &quot;Church on Tuesday&quot; as the chorus was very hypnotic. Then I moved to &quot;Atlanta&quot; for the imagery it created. My new favorite has got to be &quot;I Got You.&quot; This track makes you want to fall in love, however cheesy that may sound. It gives you a tiny window into Scott Weiland's world that cannot be marred by newspaper headlines and critics. It's straight-up real without a worry of public smearing.
0525946284|5.0|Where can I learn more history than from reading Ken Follett?  So exciting, so real, the best suspense story yet.  And always tremendously satisfying to read about courageous women who fought for freedom.  Thanks, and looking forward to the next one.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|There are a lot of great ideas that inspired Moulin Rouge: a love of musicals, the use of 1900 Paris as the seedy backdrop to a love story, the pairing of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, a love of pop-culture, etc.<br />However, it's totally undermined by editing. The movie depends entirely on &quot;attention deficit&quot; editing - songs are never completed, you never get more than a few seconds of a dance scene, the dialogue goes so fast you can't appreciate anything, etc. At one point, I got dizzy from watching it.<br />I sympathize with those that love the movie's spoectacles,and I myself am a lover of unusual art (like Cecil Taylor's music), but I literally couldn't watch this movie because it made my head spin. I think the director simply went overboard with this one. Some of the jumpy editing may have made it exhilirating, but when the entire movie is that way, most people will leave with a bad taste.<br />So be warned: the movie is very, very jumpy. If you can deal with that, you'll love it. Otherwise, avoid this one.
0345451325|5.0|I have never been a gamer. But i AM an avid reader of very good books. This book makes me want to go out and buy the game just to find out how the rest of the story goes.<BR>Just like his other books it is an intreging, reaching book. Their are many different story lines that follow the different characters. You feel for the charecters and get cought up in the story. Don't discount little details, they're meantioned for a reason.<BR>On a different note it wasn't until i got to the end and read the authors bio-thingy that I realised we had three other of his books. I was so wraped up in the story i didn't twig to the fact. I hope he will write another book for 'Halo'.

0451191153|4.0|The Fountainhead is an astonishing work of major philosophical importance as Ayn Rand presents Objectivism to the world.  In my opinion it isn't as good as Atlas Shrugged, but that's not to say this book is bad.  On the contrary, it is quite good and many authors would be lucky to do as well as Rand did with this one.<br />The novel is about, as Rand later stated, \\"individualism and collectivism in man's soul.\\"  Roark represents Rand's heroic man (the ideal we should all strive for).  He is the ultimate creator.  In his profession, architecture, he is second to none.  The antagonists are many, but the main villian in the novel is represtented by Toohey, the penultimate second-hander.  <br />Throughout the novel these two characters are competing against one another, although sometimes Roark isn't aware of the fact that Toohey is the cause of most of his problems.  As a matter of fact, Roark doesn't care.  He continues to stick to his principles and struggles on.  <br />The interesting thing is that Roark is the mover, Toohey the destroyer and Keating (a fellow architect if you want to see him as that) is the ultimate leech.  Keating depends on Roark to get him through college, through his early days at the firm, through almost everything and yet hates him for it.  Toohey is the master manipulator of public opinion (I often think of people like Bill Clinton when I think of Toohey) while Keating reminds me of the environmental-Nazi's and their total dependence upon (and hatred of) technology. <br />The only problem I had with the book was the language.  Oftentimes the characters speak in a stilted, wooden way.  I'm not sure if this was done on purpose or due to the fact that Ms. Rand's first language was Russian.  I must say that it wasn't really a distraction and almost not worth mentioning.  <br />Finally, as with Atlas Shrugged, is that you can take the themes and characters and see them in our modern everyday life.  There are plenty of people like Keating, Tooheyand even Roark.  This is a timeless novel and certainly one of my favorites.  If you've never read any of Ms. Rand's works this is a good place to start.  Just remeber the character's aren't meant to be believable and real, but arch-types of various themes/ideas.

0671799320|5.0|Especially since the tragedies of September 11th, an honest understanding of the anger the Arabs of the Middle East have toward the West in general and the United States in particular is crucial for all Americans, regardless of political philosophy or affiliation.  In &quot;The Prize&quot; Daniel Yergin helps to do just that.  Despite being an extremely well researched,well written, and fascinating tome on the history of the oil industry in the U.S. and abroad (especially for me since I grew up in it), the book furthers ones understanding of the United States' place in this history which, in turn, helps us to understand why oil is a vital national interest to the most powerful nation on earth.  With this in mind, the book helps one to understand not only the influence people like the Samuel brothers, the Rothschilds, and the Rockefellers had on the development and growth of the industry, but most importantly how and why this industry has such influence on the direction of U.S. foreign policy.
B00000K19E|5.0|I found this film to be an incredibly well integrated look at the philosophy of modern man. A great deal of the foundational plot twists follow the concept of _Atlas_Shrugged_, and the story's action is first-rate without being gratuitous. <br />The story follows Thomas Anderson (a.k.a., Neo) as he pursues an answer to the nagging suspicion that something is fundamentally wrong with the world. Like Galt's men of ability, Neo is chosen for his talents and unwillingness to flinch in the face of adversity. <br />He is enslaved by the very talents that make him who he is, and his motive power is being used to sustain a world that is, at base, a fantasy. Just as with _Atlas_Shrugged_, a single man identifies the truth, assembles a team of those capable of identifying the truth, and they continue to recruit and fight until they can stop the motor of a corrupt world. <br />The parallels are comfortably ensconced throughout the movie, and one gains the impression that the writing here was designed for numerous levels of comprehension and enjoyment. In its own right, \\"The Matrix\\" is a top-notch action film, but it is also a paean to individualism and philosophical freedom: \\"...as long as the Matrix exisits, man cannot ever truly be free.\\" <br />A key and aptly named player, Morpheus, tells Neo that everyone in the world is so \\"hopelessly inured\\" in the matrix that they are not ready to be freed; consequently, they will fight to protect their system--meaning that, until their liberation, they remain enemies to the cause of liberation. <br />Even those characters that seem a little contrived can be considered as rational players in the overall plot. For instance, there is an Oracle that each of the rebels goes to visit for insight. The Oracle is less of a visionary that a resource than a source of inspiration, for she tells her callers only what they need to here in order to be successful. In all, this was a first-rate film with a trememdously solid cast and truly enjoyable writing.
B000002IU9|5.0|Manowar is the ultimate viking battle music, dont believe all these people who are writing long reviews which ultimately say nothing in the end, manowar is and always have been a true and honest band. Hard hitting stuff that gets right to the point. True fans love it others complain in other words its up to you. Personally this is one of their best albums not to be missed. I say buy it and enjoy it, dont gloat over it likes theres no tommorow.
B00005JKQX|4.0|it is difficult to say yes.  There is a lot not to like - a film that is untrue to the Nash biography written by Sylvia Nasar (if you see the film first, don't read the book; it will spoil it for you), one that plods its way through Nash's Princeton years and then leaves the viewer unprepared for the fact that, if you blink, you will miss the 30-40 years during which Nash struggled to recover, too little of Charles (the roommate, played admirably by Paul Bettany), and too much of Parcher, played (rather well) by Ed Harris.  No, you won't enjoy it.<br />But you will find yourself engrossed by it, and you will relive parts of it in your mind for days, because \\"ABM\\" has staying power.  Most of the intensity given off by Russell Crowe is expected, given his skill in the Gladiator, and his incredibly gifted performance in \\"The Insider\\".  He does not disappoint here, and, without him, Ron Howard would not have been able to draw the viewers in so completely before Nash's schizophrenia is exposed.  Indeed, when you start to realize that what you have been watching in the first half of the movie is really not true, just part of Nash's delusions, you are completely taken aback by Crowe's and Howard's skill.<br />It is disappointing that the most difficult part of life and marriage, learning to live the long years with the disability, with all the hopes and dreams shattered and just the reality left for the Nash's to cope with....is run over is such a roughshod manner by Howard.  There is one poignant scene that does help to bring the film home much more than the ending \\"Nobel Prize\\" scene....and that is the scene at Nash's classroom door, as the Nobel visitor watches, Nash's students come out of his class with obvious exhiliaration, and it is evident that they care very much for this strange professor.  His teasing of one of the young students helps you to realize that there are, indeed, moments of normalcy in his adult life that help to make up for the despair.<br />A beautiful and haunting film with a fine (although not award-winning) performance by Jennifer Connelly....Crowe deserves the Oscar, Howard does not.  And the film?  Easily remembered, much to be admired, but...can't hold a candle to the tale of the Hobbits.ful and haunting film with a fine (although not award-winning) performance by Jennifer Connelly....Crowe deserves the Oscar, Howard does not.

B000002H97|5.0|This C.D \\"Metallica\\" is they're entrance into the main stream of music. They combined good beats and hard guitars to make an epic album. The best song on this C.D is undoutably \\"Enter Sandman\\" which everyone thinks of as \\"Metallica's Song\\". But it also contains excellent tracks such as the moving slower songs of \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\". My second Favorite song on this track is \\"Sad But True\\" which is a hard rock epic. The point is, IF YOU ARE GOING TO BY YOUR FIRST METALLICA ALBUM, BUY THIS ONE, YOU WON'T BE SORRY, THIS IS METALLICA!
B00005TT77|3.0|Up until now, the only Beatles cover worth it's studio time was Stevie Wonder's &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;.  The funniest thing about this soundtrack is that the more established artists didn't mess with the Beatles original productions much and made their contributions true tributes. The newer, lesser known artists went nuts changing and rearranging the songs in some sickening attempt to prove themselves!  Fortunately we're spared this horrible blasphemy until the latter half of the CD.  &quot;Julia&quot; is totally massacred as is &quot;Revolution&quot;.  Beatles fans will not be able to deal with this.  Highlights are Ben Harper with &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and Aimee Mann/Michael Penn on &quot;Two Of Us&quot;.  Those two cuts are worth buying the whole CD for.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|i didn't know what to expect when my wife rented this dvd (gigi meets the original ferrer moulin rouge?), and then when i started watching it, i didn't know what to think, except that it enthralled and overwhelmed me, and in the end, I liked it.  <br />this movie moves fast and is all over the place, in throbbing music and shifting camera angles, and is the plushest splash of color since warren beatty's dick tracy.  it is unlike any movie musical you have ever seen unless you have seen ballroom.  <br />for a while, when the music and constantly switching camera shots were bombarding my senses, especially the production numbers such as can-can, i thought i would start having seizures, what with the bright lights and throbbing subwoofer behind my tv.  it was like studio 54 comes to montmarte.<br />the plot is a thin cliche -- the poor, virtuous artist vying with the evil rich man for the hand of the unobtainable, beautiful (albeit tubercular) love goddess, with moral support from his bohemian band of merry men --  but it works, perhaps because the plot is cushioned and cosseted by so much else that is going on.<br />the cast -- ewan macgregor (equal parts john travolta, rex smith and kevin kline), nicole kidman (she can really sing -- who knew?), john leguizamo (scene stealer and talent extraordinaire) and jim broadbent (engaging, not-quite old fogie, a la his roles in topsy turvy and bridget jones,  altough seedier here), as well as the guy who plays the bad guy (i kept seeing dana carvey), are all great and eat up their roles, almost tongue in cheek.<br />the splendid seraglio-like set (with the metaphorical mill blades, turning, turning) and use of computer graphics to show aerial shots of paris (it's a long way from sacre coeur to la tour d'eiffel...) at the tawdry end of la belle epoque,  continually stun and amaze throughout the movie -- and where, says this rube, do you get some of that-there green absinthe?<br />this movie reminded me at times of cabaret, pirates of penzance and saturday night fever, with a little of a knight's tale thrown in for good anachronistic measure.  it has elements of all and is worth the experience of seeing how a daring, imaginative visionary director can push the boundaries of what we think constitutes a movie musical after 75 years of making them.  go see it or rent it or buy it.  the two dvd combo gives you a lot of extras, visual and musical and informative.<br />i definitely recommend that you rent or buy this dvd; i plan to.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has a great album. I am a big Britney fan. Some song titles you think bring Britney's name down but it didnt, just because some of them is \\"I'm a Slave For You\\" or \\"Boys\\".

B00004TX5F|1.0|This was in a technical sense an interesting film. As everyone would know this film is about a castratii. A singer who has had his testicles cut off before puberty to preserve a boys voice. The sort of voice which was achieved by these singers is now something of a problem and the parts are sung by women. In an attempt to reproduce the sort of sound that would have occured two singers, a man and woman have tracks morphed by a computer. The sound is fascinating. The movie however is not. <br />The hero Farinelli apart from being one of Europes leading singers became a companion of the king of Spain in later life. He would thus have seemed to be a person of some interlect and charm. <br />The film however is pretty grotesque. It makes his castration the center point of the film and the basis of the entire tension and plot direction. Whilst such an operation would clearly be a bit of a shock, we would probably see it as so. For Farinelli it would not doubt be different. It was a decision which moved him from a person with no future to wealth and a place in a royal court. Of course nowdays we tend to see sexual matters as more important and the film reflects this rather modern attitude with the theme being his sense of loss and betrayal. It is his brother who has drugged and castrated him at a young age and then makes a living off him by managing him. <br />Despite a modern view of things being cast back on a far different time, the film is quite grotesque. Thus Farinelli's brother uses him to get girls \\"in the mood\\" and as they lie in bed sexually excited he comes in to finish the job his brother cannot do. Again something which is the creation of the film director to explain the co-dependance of the brothers and the shame and hostility of Farinelli. <br />In general the film is a dissapointment. The portrayal of the characters such as Handel is absurd. The tensions and drama within the film are contrived. The singing is however good. But over all weird, and dissapointing.
B00005QB9A|5.0|This movie really touched me as a musician. That one mans devotion to music would be so great that he would never have to leave his ship. All he needed was an idea and the music would flow.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Let's say one did not know that this movie was supposed to be by a famous highly-respected director. If I had seen this movie at a student film festival or something, it would have struck me as being a very dull, unoriginal story of depressing things in general, but told by someone who was egotistical to the point of disregarding the audience, and so pumped with hallucinogens that they couldn't even keep their characters straight. Yes, the actors change who they play for no obvious reason. Go figure. There are also mini elf-people, a guy dressed in a bigfoot costume (I'm not joking), and a million-hour-long rehearsal of Sole Mio which ends in the singer dying or something. Essentially, the movie is pointless and random, as well as painfully long. If there is a meaning, well, one must ask if a meaning so cryptic it's undecipherable is really a meaning at all.
B00005QB9A|5.0|What a wonderful concept and so well done.  The movie looks great, sounds even greater and captures your mind and heart like few films today.  An absolute masterpiece.
0399236201|5.0|Stormbraker is the best book iv ever read!  I stayed up to 12 o clock for 5 nights reading it. This book is about a kid who has a uncle in the MI6. Only he thinks his unle works at the bank. People said he wasnt wearing his seatbelt and crashed, but he is always extra carful. Alex knows somthings up, Do you?
B00005631D|5.0|Forgive me for stealing a line from another song, but this album takes me to summer breezes, tropical drinks, ocean air, swaying palm trees (you get the idea).  Why, why why, is this so hard to find on cd? It's the kind of music that takes you away to a relaxed place. Definitely recommended!!
0671042858|4.0|I'm a  long time fan of Steven King, even though I found this book deeply involved. it's not really his best work. that's why I give it four stars. dont' get me wrong I loved the book but if I had to pick a favaorite of his this isn't it. the best book of his I've read would have to be Dorliors Clayborne. Which I found to be a break from his normal &quot;Scare the Hell of you!&quot; style which I do love. but this book defineitly shows King's abilaity to be so much more than just a horror writer. in fact I'm in his Libary and I can't wait to get every book he's ever writen.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I'll be honest; I've had the impression for the past few years that British rock is far superior to that of our home country. I could look at one side of the spectrum and see Radiohead, Blur, Gorillaz, Manic Street Preachers and Massive Attack, and then look to our shores and see.....Limp Bizkit and Fuel. It's an unfair comparison, I'm sure, but the English bands that I mentioned are unbearably popular, and opposed to the near-anonymity of, say, At the Drive-In. It wasn't always like this.<br />It took me a long time to make up my mind after my friend recommended that I listen to \\"Is This It.\\" I was a little bit cautious (and not in the least bit excited), but everyone I'd talk to was raving about it, and this was back in November. When I finally did listen to it, it was confounding. I think I was expecting something along the lines of Guns 'N' Roses, and instead it was more like I had raided my brother's Velvet Underground collection. Every song was three minutes, sometimes indecipherable, and unbearably catchy. I found \\"Is This It,\\" \\"The Modern Age,\\" \\"Soma,\\" \\"Hard to Explain,\\" and \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" to be the best tracks, but if the option is available, get the UK Version with \\"New York City Cops.\\" The song is not even measurably offensive, but in the wake of the 9/11 attacks it would have gone over as well as the Iranian debut of \\"Salman Rushdie's Greatest Hits\\"<br />I realize that there's probably a lot of \\"historical analysis\\" that goes along with these guys; it's more than obvious that they're paying homage to '70s NYC bands. However, In an era when the hooks from pop songs are stolen directly from published material, it's really not a big deal. Besides, it's practically a fixture in rock 'n' roll that you steal from your influences. All in all, I'm not hesitant to call this the album of 2001. I'm looking forward to when their next effort comes out; I think we've got us a winner here in America.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I'm not sure what other people are seeing when they say this is a horrible movie. This movie was one of the best ive ever seen. It had an extremely orignal plot, incredible acting, and a script that made you think if you really did have another side to yourself. The peope that gave this movie a bad review most likely didnt see past the violence. Maybe its just me but i like it when movies are violent to the point where they make you feel kind of uncomfortable. It gave the movie a certain grittiness that was needed to enhance the story and make it such a masterpiece. The underlying mesage in this movie is great. Under all of the blood and gore is an extremely well done picture which can make you think, cringe and never forget this movie. Buy it now, its worth the 20 bucks.
B00005N83O|5.0|ok... well i gotta tell you this albem rox my world! this is jennifer lopez at her very best. my favs are i'm real and ain't it funny. they're the best tracks besides love don't cost a thing and play. j.lo's work on this albem is outstanding! i listen to this all day long! and i know u will too if u buy it. i looovvee it so much! jennifer rulez in acting AND singing. this is her best albem ever. so check it out!! u will love the tune of the songs, the lyrics and the feel of it when u turn it on at a party. so BUY IT!! :)
B00000AFWW|5.0|sad to say that i actually have never heard of hole prior tp cobain's death. although i've wanted to have this album since it first came out, i never did get around to it until recently... so i can't really say how this album compares to their previous work, but i *do* know that this has to be one of the best release ever.  although love's voice is not the best there is out there, she manages to work within her boundaries and produces some of the most haunting songs.<br />the title track, \\"malibu\\", \\"northern star\\", and \\"dying\\" are my personal favorites. celebrity skin is a very cynical look into the world of hollywood and rock'n'roll.. its meant to shake you up and the guitar riff is just OTT. amazing! \\"malibu\\" on the other hand is just indescribable... the song is one of the best song there is in this album and it's very melancholic... probably about cobain...<br />however, the rest of the songs are just as powerful and are no mere fillers.  since love is the lyricist, there are a lot of references to cobain's death and that somehow makes the whole album more real. this album has a lot of slow songs in it, but the elements of rock is pretty much intact even in the slower tracks.<br />this album is definitely a keeper, either to veteran hole fans or to novices like myself. great, great album...
B00005RFAI|5.0|if you haven't bought this yet buy it now. for fans of pink, no doubt, christina aqilera and hip-hop or dance artists not stupid little teeny-bopper stuff. the best songs on the albem are dear diary and get this party started. if u like britney spears then i suggest that u don't get this cd. buts it is soo darn good get it now! i listen to it every day maybe u will too cuz the music is amazingly good, plus pink rockxx!!! :)
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD rocks.  Best CD I've ever bought, actually.  I absolutely love all of the songs except one, which is track 11-- it is a relaxing song, I guess and I sometimes listen to it, but it is not screamingly excellent, as the other ones are.<br />When I first got the CD, I was getting it for 3 songs: one step closer, crawling, and In the end.  After I listened to the CD a lot, I grew to like it more and more.  This band is awesome and I cannot wait for their 2nd CD.  This band blows everyone out of the water (pretty much).<br />These guys deserve more CD sales!<br />Anyways, its a great CD.  For this CD to have 4.5 stars avg. on this writing for 800 reviews, its pretty incredible.  That is because this CD is excellent and full of good rock.
B00005YTFG|5.0|Wow! immedietly when the movie begins you're entralled, and the first entrance to the club is astounding!!!! The music is AWESOME! this is a movie for musical lovers. The dances were great the costumes were gorgeous, Moulin Rouge should be an oscar winning film!
0440219078|5.0|I love to read. My little brother hates to read. I read The Giver in high school, and was so captivated that I ended up reading it several times. My brother heard me raving enough that he bought me the book for Christmas (the perfect gift). Then he--the boy who never reads--actually read it. Even he loved it. Other reviews will tell you why this book is so amazing (read them!). I just want to say that this book will touch you, whether you love books or hate them.
6300181464|4.0|This belongs to that rare genre SPECULATIVE sci-fi, where what is depicted could soon take place. Silent Running refers to an earth in future without the sound of birds due to the absence of forests and most other vegetative life, as much as it refers to the soundlessness of outer space. Here we have a tract for the foresight needed to maintain not only our earth as a healthy planet, but a place that would then encourage healthy people, both physically and socially.<br />While Bruce Dern gives one of his characteristic performances of an off kilter individual, he succeeds in obtaining the sympathy of the viewer for a return to a verdant earth, from the sterile and dessicated environs of ships in space. When his three shipmates are willing to obey orders to destroy the ship and return to a barren earth of artificial food and air, Bruce's character finds the unforseen will to do the unthinkable. His solid performance is one in a long line of distinctive portrayals. Still, it is really the three little robots: \\"Huey, Dewey, and Loui\\" who steal the show in clever asides and moments of pathos, even for these very 'human' machines.<br />One of the great blessings of this film is that it does not beat one over the head with strident sound, nor do the special effects, which are excellent, ever take over the story. You feel the desperation of Bruce's character and yet you understand the dillema the crew faces as the orders come down. I was taken with the scene where the three antagonists of crewmen berate Lowell, Bruce's protagonist, for bringing into their quarters a real cantelope, which the other three fellows call \\"stinking!\\", this a vivid way of demonstrating the alienation that people can attain when too long removed from the nuture of our earth as is paralleled in many of the urban 'jungles' of today. As our society becomes more and more urbanized and divorced from the goodness of God's earth, we too often find the natural odors of earth unpleasant, while we come to regard artificialy conditioned air as 'natural.' <br />While the movie is very entertaining on the strictly visual level, it is more a cautionary tale about how we could mess up our earth and our futures if we don't pay attention to the false hopes of technology, in company with human greed. The tug-at-your-heartstrings ending will disappoint some, but realists will acknowledge it ruefully. The gardeners among us may smile at the desperate attempts to provide light for the forest in the end, but no one will go away without a greater appreciation of just how ingenious and precious is ALL life on earth, vegatable or otherwise. To be sure, the true God, our Creator, will never allow the situation depicted here to develop, for He \\"... did not created the [Earth] simply for nothing ...\\" (Isaiah 45:18) and that He will \\"bring to ruin those ruining the earth.\\" (Rev. 11:18) Yet, before that day shortly arrives, one can enjoy this blend of sleek science fiction with the gentle theme of reverence for God's creation, all against a melodious musical background.

B00005RZTI|5.0|I have to say I had never heard of Kylie Minogue until i saw MADONNA wear a shirt with her name on it at the 2000 MTV Europe Video Music Awards. I knew she could not be that bad if MADONNA liked her. I heard in 1989 she did she did a cover of the song LOCOMOTION which i found a bit funny. I also heard she was popular every where but the U.S. When I saw her video for Can't Get You Out of My Head at the end of January, i just could not get the beat and song out of my head. I knew it was gonna be big here in the U.S. cause every place I went to get the Import CD they said they had none left. I managed to pick up a import copy of her FEVER CD at one of the Sam Goodys since it would not be released her in the U.S till February 25, 2002. I have to say the CD is much better than I expected it to be. There is 12 total songs and she has a high pitch voice which reminds me of early MADONNA but she seems to have a weaker voice when compared to MADONNA. My CD is this very hard to find import from Australia which includes a Bonus Track called TIGHTROPE which is one of the best songs on this album, but sadly it will not be on the U.S. version. Besides #13 Tightrope The best songs on this album are #2 Love At First Sight is a great song but it has a bass line that sounds very much like MADONNA's Holiday, check it out for yourself. #3 Can't Get You Out of My Head, #4 Fever, #7 Come Into My World, #8 In Your Eyes, #11 Love Affair, The #12 song Burning Up is good but she sounds like Janet Jackson on certain parts. I can say with the most confidence Kylie Minogue's FEVER CD along with the soon to be hit (in the U.S.) Can't Get You Out of My Head are going to both be big and a huge comeback for Kylie. I give this CD 5 out of 5 stars. The U.S. version of this CD will be out on February 26, 2002.
630503723X|4.0|There is something about Kristel, this genre, this era, that I must have a lack of good judgement.  Perhaps I can blame it on my adolescence.  My utopian sex life would mirror these cheesy videos.  Kristel is beatiful, her lovers are too.  The soft core sex scenes definitely work for me.  This video makes for a great escape from the realities of sexual freedom.  There are no jealousies, ugly consequences or ugly people.  --  Again, I think that I could be a bit more critical if this movie were made with another actress.  I have a soft spot for Kristel in my cynical view of soft porn.  All of her Emmanuelle films are fun to watch.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I just watched Pearl Harbor and found it to be a really solid film. I did not expect much based on review I had heard, but it was much better than I anticipated. Not being a history or aviation expert, I can not say if every detail was accurate or realistic, but it was close and it was all exciting to watch. And yes, there is a heavy romance side to the movie. Much of the movie is dedicated to the friendship between the main characters and the girl they both fall for...but it works. The emotional side of the movie add emotion to the attack scenes. They spend time developing these characters and their relationship so we can feel what the war meant to them. If you want a historical documentary on Pearl Harbor, don't buy this movie. If you want a pretty good interpretation of the events, some exciting and dramatic action scenes, and a decent story of romance during war...then this movie is a good pick for you. I don't like romance movies, but I loved Pearl Harbor...especially with the sound quality the DVD gave me.
0316548189|5.0|This book is the autobiography of Nelson Mandela, one of the true heroes of our times. The book was largely written during his imprisonment on Robben Island and describes his development from an average student to one of the world's most respected leaders. <br />It gives important insights into the decisions he made and had to make both as a human being and as a political leader.<BR>Mr. Mandela's biggest accomplishment is of course his ability to return from a 27-year imprisonment mentally unbroken and without an overwhelming feeling of revenge, a truly superhuman accomplishment in the view of all the actions the white minority government undertook to make his life miserable.<br />The common denominator in all his actions is a very highly developed sense of justice: from his decision to study law to his rise through the ranks of the ANC. Even the decision to revert from peaceful action to armed guerilla combat becomes understandable. <br />A truly important book, which is, after a rather tough beginning, a very smooth and entertaining read.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|There are several good reviews of the movie so I will not say anything other then it had me smiling from the first minute right to the end.<br />I want to talk a bit about the DVD. It's a two DVD set, the first is pan and scan, the second wide screen. I'm not interested in the pan and scan version myself but the disk is worth having for the extras included on the disc, and you may like it if you have a small TV or young kids. But the second disk rocks! Wide screen and DTS sound. The mix on the DTS track has greater dynamic range, more like the original theater sound track. Turn up the volume and you realy hear what \\"home theater\\" can do.<br />Lots of good extras too. Tech of Shrek was interesting and even funny. The directors commentary track on most DVDs puts me to sleep, but Shrek's didn't. The extras on a lot of DVDs are just filler, but the extras on Shrek really add to the enjoyment of the movie. <br />I've watched Shrek three times already, and I've never watched a movie three times in a week before.<br />Just thinking about it makes me want to go watch it again!

0345448898|5.0|Harry Potter might satisfy you, but it is nothing compared to this.  \\"His dark materials\\" is full of action and adventure, and while harry potter might seem like it covered both of those, it was not nearly as satisfing as these books.  Harry Potter was a page turner, but this is a stay-up-all-nighter.  These books have a much deeper story than Harrry Potter.  These books are very  creative, which is more itself than any harry Potter book.  If you are looking for a magical fantisy book to satisfy your needs, get this!
B00000IMCW|5.0|This was my first introduction to zombies and I have been addicted ever since. I love all kinds of horror movies,but zombies are probably my favorite. Dawn Of The Dead is definitely in my top 10 horror movie list,(along with The Exorcist,The Evil Dead,Phantasm,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Blair Witch Project,City Of The Living Dead,to name a few). My list may change slightly from time to time,but DawnOTD is always there. If you are new to zombie movies,I would recommend this one first. It is the best of the Romero trilogy(in my opinion). It has a few scares,alot of gore,and a great story. This well written movie is entertaining from beginning to end. A true classic! Thank you Mr. Romero.

But I will anyway: Please, Mr. Waugh, stick to cute satire, and leave the romance fiction to the less acute; make the books more mordant than maudlin; model \\"The Loved One\\", which was far better than this tale of loved ones.<br />My main complaint is that Waugh here comes off as little more than a poor man's Oscar Wilde. You have a proliferation of aesthete's epigrams (\\"Oh, Charles, don't be such a tourist. What does it matter when it was built, if it's pretty?\\"), the crypto-homoeroticism (actually, it's not that well hidden at all), and various variations on Dorian Gray's syndrome. But where Wilde's writing revels in its formulas and in it's decadence, Waugh doesn't appear to be having very much fun.<br />The first half begins well enough. Charles Ryder, a cipheric army captain, happens on Brideshead Castle after a lengthy absence. It, and its occupants, defined his youth, and the sight of it forces forward a flood of memories. The remainder of the novel takes place within these memories, Ryder mainly acting as observer of those around him. He is a fine narrator, allowing equal time to the objective and subjective aspects of his memory (i.e., the events as they happened vs. his reactions to said events). <br />While at Oxford, his chief subject is Sebastian Flyte, a charming dipsomaniac. Sebastian is Charles' best and only friend, while being his 'in' to Brideshead. He's an addictively self-destructive character, still in love with his childhood (a teddy-bear named Aloysius goes with him everywhere; he adores his old nanny), which eventually leads to his own undoing. It's typical of the novel that when Sebastian's immature drunkenness rears its ugly head, one of his school chums casually remarks: \\"How boring!\\" Charles' days at Oxford are the novel's high points, as the charming and intriguing people he meets form a peculiar tapestry. It was a true pleasure to read the first hundred or so pages, as Waugh appears on top of his game.<br />Unfortunately, Oxford days are abandoned in the novel's second half, and the narrative flounders under the weight of 'big ideas'. While the residents of Brideshead are no less fascinating than the Oxford boys (as Sebastian accurately says: \\"I'm not going to have you [Charles] get mixed up with my family. They're so madly charming.\\"), the harsh melodrama that ensues got on my nerves. And, ultimately, Waugh never gives his characters anything cohesive to do; episodes drag on much too long, wearing out their welcome long after any relevant point has been made. Take his treatment of Lady Marchmain, Brideshead's matriarch, and a devout Catholic. A side comment by (her daughter) Cordelia epitomizes her mother's character:<br />\\"I sometimes think when people wanted to hate God they hated mummy... She was saintly but she wasn't a saint. No one could really hate a saint, could they? They can't really hate God either. When they want to hate Him and his saints they have to find something like themselves and pretend it's God and hate that.\\"<br />Out of the mouths of babes, no? Cordelia (read: Waugh) crystallizes in that one speech all the problems that religion has brought to the novel's second half. It's typical of the kind of sharp writing Waugh excels at. But the effect is diluted when the argument is repeated, in various forms, ad nauseam. It got to be quite tedious.<br />Charles, at one point, pledges to only live in a world of three-dimensions, that he can experience with his five senses. He soon he finds out that artifice rules the day, especially at Brideshead Castle, and such a world doesn't exist. I'd expected Waugh to pounce all over this idea with his sharp pen and sharper mind. But instead he revels in Charles' overwrought sincerity. Waugh's pointed wit usually punctures holes in stuffy characters such as these, but here he is content to just create them.<br />While in arcadian Oxford, \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" shines, enough that I can offer a marginal recommendation. Once it leaves that idyllic setting, Waugh gets rusty.
B00005UEAR|5.0|The numbers are clear. Two CDs. 96 minutes of music. One eight-part song. 42 minutes. Dream Theater has once again raised their own incredibly high standards for ambition with their latest album. Having followed the enormous pre-release speculation and having avoided hearing the monumental title track until the afternoon before their warmup show in New York, I had great expectation that we would soon be blessed with an effort of incredible depth and art of the highest measure. Let the truth be told: Six Degrees is music of the highest order, an album that reaches for impossible heights and succeeds. It is by far DT's most challenging and diverse work, and every member of the band plays to perfection. Before going into specifics, there is a very simple question, the test that stumped absolutely no one: what song were you looking forward to the most? The first disc is wonderful, from the raging Glass Prison, a monster of a song that will forever silence anyone who still believes that DT aren't metal, to the heroically resigned and multifaceted Misunderstood, bleak lyrically and full of impeccable musicianship, to the languid Disappear, a song that reaches for the melancholic heights (or should I say lows) of Space Dye Vest and comes close, to the triumphant Blind Faith, a superlative composition that my appreciation for grows with each listen, to the contentious Great Debate, perhaps the album's most daring experiment with its droning pace and argumentative vocal arrangement, this is certain. But stupid questions deserve obvious answers, so here is an indepth analysis of disc 2 of Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence.<br />Like SFAM, it begins with an Overture. Unlike Overture 1928, which had John putting on a tremendous instrumental preview of things to come, this section attempts to be a full-on classical piece. It is a bit labored and drags in places, but has some moments of beauty, a great keyboard cadence at around 2:45, and is an entirely necessary component of the picture, especially towards the end. After the orchestral swelling, we soon learn we are About To Crash. This song tells the story of a girl born into an illusion of perfection, which leads her to depression from unrealized expectation. This song is the most warmly melodic of the eight sections, and the chorus is highly emotional. John delivers the first of many great solos. The instrumental transitions are among the finest points on the disc. Soon the music gains in tension and now we prepare to fight a War Inside My Head. A short piece about traumatic combat experiences, this is a menacing little track led by a killer keyboard riff. The chorus features a great backing vocal from Mike Portnoy, whose drumming dominates the next part, The Test That Stumped Them All. This is possibly the heaviest song Dream Theater has ever done, featuring a devastating lead riff. A chronicle of a rock star forced to undergo psychiatric evaluation, James' vocals seethe with rage and Portnoy's drumming is lethal. The song also features some electronically treated vocals that add to the themes of insanity throughout the concept. After another great instrumental section, everything drops out and we receive a Goodnight Kiss. A disturbing lullaby about a mother who loses her daughter, possibly to drugs or a severe disability, this is arguably the emotional high point of the epic. If this doesn't touch you in some way, you probably have a heart of stone. A beautifully fluid guitar solo, aided by rising tension in the drums and some sound effects, adds to the intensity of the piece, in contrast to the violent imagery and music of the last two parts. Soon acoustic guitars and warm keyboards break in, inviting us to the Solitary Shell. This is another great song, again highly emotional and deeply melodic and incredibly thoughtful, its lyrics telling a story about an autistic child's development...this affected me the most out of any moment on the disc. An extraordinarily powerful composition initself. Another great instrumental section closes out this part, building into a reprise of About To Crash, a more energetic counterpart to the first installment, here the character's determination to escape leads to disappointment and possibly manic depression. The band plays its... off, particularly Jordan Rudess, who proves himself to be the most talented of DT's three keyboardists with amazing performances throughout. Parts first heard in the Overture begin to resurface here, reminding us we are Losing Time. This is a short piece before the Grand Finale, which unifies the themes of the previous sections and provides for a stirring and dramatic conclusion for a stunning work of art.
0385335482|4.0|If you adore shopping, you'll like this book.  I especially enjoyed the romantic aspect of it.  However, all the letters from the bank telling her she owes so much money, and in reaction to these letters, her endless shopping, gets a little annoying.  She often acts very immature and it can be irritating.  However, it has a great ending and I enjoyed it very much.  But don't expect to gain too much from it, as you might from, say, Jemima J, by Jane Green&lt;-best EVER!!
B00000I41J|5.0|If you like Kind Of Blue, you are in for a real treat here. Adderley, Miles and Blakey were and still are such big stars in the jazz world that their work is in a class of its own. The fact that they are collaborating here is an added bonus. Adderley's joyful sound and Miles's Emotional Charges Harmon Mute is absolutely exquisite on this album. Best cut would definately be Autumn Leaves, since Miles's work on this track almost brings a tear to my eyes because it is so beautiful.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is probably the most flawless Jazz masterpiece ever released. Miles must have been one hellova talent scout to get John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley together on this classic Album.<br />What makes this album so great? Firstly the artists are some of the most influential artists in the Jazz World. Secondly, this is not just an ordinary jazz album. By using modes instead of chord structures to base improvisation, Miles gave his sidemen (and himself) the artistic freedom to express themeselves. You will hear on this album Miles's signature emotional playing, John Coltrane's reflective and haunting style and Adderley's cheery personality seeping into his music. The tracks chosen are perfect, with So What probably being the best cut, altough they are all lovely. <br />This album is no where near as hard as some of Miles's later work, and so will appeal to more people. The best thing about this album is that every single not just belongs where it is, and it sounds as fresh as anything released today. The sound quality of the CD reissue is fantastic (except for the slight tape hiss) and it feels like the musicians are right in front of you. Even if you don't like jazz, get this; you may change your mind. This is truly the work of a musician's musician.
B00003CXA6|5.0|A movie truly on a grand scale.  Depicting the true horror of this terrible war.  America ripping itself apart and inflicting wounds that are still with us today.  The only down point of the film was Martin Sheen in a less than spectacular performance as Robert E. Lee.

0446608955|2.0|I admit, I read the thing in one sitting. I was mainly curious to see if the character of Jamie would develop at all, or if she would remain the insanely non-human kid that she was in chapter 1. (Which she did.) Jamie annoyed the heck out of me...NO ONE is that perfect. She didn't have a single fault, which made it really hard for me to relate to her. I mean, I understood the whole reject-from-society thing, and the love for her father, etc, but seriously, EVERYONE has some insecurities. She didn't. Also, the chemistry between her and Landen was seriously lacking, and the development of Landen's character was really cliche. One day the only thing that matters is that his friends don't see him with Jamie, the next, he's professing his undying love to her. Also, it was freakishly predictable from the very beginning. Don't get me wrong...A Walk to Remember is a nice story if you're really bored and strong enough to handle the corniness, but apart from that, I think my seventh grade cousin could have written it just as well as Nicholas Sparks.
B000002V0Q|5.0|ALTHOUGH THEY MAY HAVE TONED DOWN A BIT , THIS IS CLEARLY AN AWESOME RELEASE FROM '' MEGADETH '' !

IT FOLLOWS CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF '' RUST IN PEACE ''!! ALTHOUGH IT HAS A BIT OF MELODY IN IT AS WELL , IT'S  STILL A VERY HEAVY RELEASE..AND FOR A 1992 RELEASE IT IS WAY AHEAD OF IT'S TIME !! AND DON'T FORGET THE NEW ONE '' THE WORLD NEEDS A HERO '' . BUT STAY AWAY FROM '' RISK ''.. THE ONLY  THING IT CAN BE USED FOR , IS TO BE USED AS A FRISBEE !! SO IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FRESH , HEAVY , AND NOT A SELLOUT LIKE THE LAST ONES BY '' METALLICA '' . THEN GET THIS ONE NOW..YOU WON'T REGRET IT ONE BIT !!!!
B000002H33|5.0|I hate metal. I can't listen to it. The hardcore elements of so much of today's music just irritates me. The hard funk of the 70s and the hard bop of the 60s is as hard as I go, sticking mainly to the works of soulful R &amp; B acts and boardering-on-experimental Jazz artists.<br />However no matter how much I hate this music, one cannot deny that this album is one of music's defining moments. Just as Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye defined Soul, and Miles Davis And John Coltrane defined Jazz, we see a band hear who defined and set benchmarks for metal that may never be bettered. These were not just musicians, but artists who are were far more realised than most metal artists today.
B00004WG2X|2.0|I bought this video based on the reviews which claimed it was more faithful to the book than the A&amp;E version.  Well, I don't know what book they were comparing it to, but it was definitely not Pride and Prejudice!<br />I found that this version cut a whole lot more scenes and dialogue from the book than the A&amp;E version.  The subtle Jane Austen wit and humor that is inherent in the book is completely missing from this version.  The casting is disappointing and the performances are wooden.  <br />The characters of Elizabeth and Jane are perhaps a little more conventionally pretty than in the A&amp;E version, but that's all that can be said in favor of this adaptation.<br />If you want to see the book come to life on the screen, rent or buy the A&amp;E version.  Skip this one.<br />But, as I said, don't put your faith in reviews, not even mine.  To each his own.  To me, Colin Firth!
B00005QGAT|5.0|Although many people would disagree with me and say that Thriller is his best work, this is in my opinion more what I would call a classic album. Being a fan of the 70s funk/soul style, this is a real treat, with Don't Stop Til You Get Enough really standing out. The best slow jam would be She's Out Of My Life, really haunting. What makes it stand out is how really fresh it is and shows how much potential Michael had. Its greatness really shos how far he has fallen. Imagine if he began now instead of then! He would not have the fans he does now if not for this album and Thriller and his work with the Jackson Five. Worth buying, especially in the remastered expanded form.
B00004WG2X|2.0|After reading the review which claimed that this version was much more true to the book than the A&amp;E version, I purchased it.  I couldn't wait to get home to watch it!<br />All I can say is, I don't know which book this film is so true to, but it is definitely not Pride and Prejudice!  Many pivotal scenes and a lot of dialogue were either eliminated or altered so that they lacked the emotion and the humor that Jane Austen had so brilliantly crafted.  The casting was appalling and the performances were wooden.<br />Except for the fact that Elizabeth and Jane were a bit more conventionally pretty in this adaptation, the A &amp; E version beats it hands down in every other category.  When you watch that version, it's almost like reading the book.<br />If you have to buy one film adaptation of the novel, buy the A&amp;E version.  Then you won't be disappointed as I was.<br />But, as I said, don't put your faith in reviews!  To each his own!  To me, Colin Firth!
052594527X|5.0|There is only one word to describe this book, and that would be classic. With accurate depictions of a young girl's thoughts and feelings this book is sure to keep you reading. I highly recommend this book to all women, expecially teenagers. Enjoy!
0385505833|3.0|I viewed the first 2 chapters on the net. I admit, I was hooked! I  couldnt wait to get my hands on the book. When I finally received it, I was alittle disappointed that the book was so small, I read it in 3 hrs. The beginning was excellent, but as I got to the end, boy was I disappointed! I find myself feeling like Luther Krank, just wanting to skip it all together. The way he describes the hassle and expense of the whole over-rated, commercialized (def. to exploit for profit) holiday, I surely related to all this. As I approched the end, I thought \\"Oh no, NO NO No! But I guess the moral of the story is, Christmas is not the hassle and expense that comes with the holiday, but the spirit of sharing and Love.
B000002LCU|4.0|The broad grin you see on George's face on the cover of CLOUD NINE hints at what awaits you when you play the CD. George had rarely sounded so relaxed and at ease. It's his best recording since ALL THINGS MUST PASS.<br />I don't understand one of the earlier reviewers here describing George's guitar playing as \\"rusty.\\" Excuse me? Did you not listen to \\"This Is Love\\"? How about \\"Someplace Else,\\" \\"That's What It Takes,\\" and the title track? The word that comes to my mind is \\"superb.\\"

B00005U18E|4.0|In Bridget Jones's Diary, we are introduced to Bridget Jones, a thirty-something British woman desperately looking for love. Her co-worker and eventual love interest, played by Hugh Grant, is devilishly handsome and charmingly played by the suave Grant. Colin Firth, another Brit actor, adeptly plays a successful lawyer(?). Firth has a natural type of aloofness and pride that makes him suitable to play both this character and Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Both Firth and Grant contend for her affections. Renee Zellweger, ever lovable and emphatic, connects with the audience; as Jones, she portrays a size-12 smoking and drinking woman. She admirably attempts to ignore her matchmaking mother, quit her smoking and drinking, lose weight, and start a meaningful relationship. She records her social ups and downs and personal gains and losses in a diary which proves to play a key role in the movie. <BR>The movie is filled with twists and turns and a few hilarious scenes punctuated by those more moody and dramatic. It is a light, romantic comedy which I highly recommend, especially to those of the female population. I really sympathized with Bridget and her earnest attempts to be a more contented, healty women. She showed real weakness in her diet relapses and emotional strife in the relationship with Grant. The almost cynical comedy was highly entertaining as was the fabulous performances given by the actors and actresses. The book would probably be better than the movie, but I have yet to read it. This movie is almost as good as chocolate, and that's saying something.
0060920432|4.0|Not an easy read, it may require a committment to finish, but well worth the effort.<br />If you have wondered why playing a mediocre game of golf is more personally rewarding than watching mutli-millionaires slap bellies on TV (football), Mihaly has the answer.
B0000560X3|5.0|This one took me back to where I can remember my first High Fidelity system, which is a long way back. This is my first DVD Audio Disc, and I am hooked. The sound quality is awesome, it was like I heard my system for the first time. I could not believe how dynamic and spacial so old of a recording could be. Every song has strong clear bass, and bright crisp high ends. If you like Deep Purple or Classic Rock this is an Outstanding Disc. I could not find anything not to like about it. I really liked the photo album, and the live video made me appreciate how good the DVD Audio recording was. I could listen to every track loud and for a long time which has not been my experience with a lot of classic rock cd's.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|What a pretentious mess..<BR>I was forced to watch this tribute to pain by a relative who thinks this film is &quot;so wonderful and innovative&quot;. FAH! How can a film be boring and irritating at the same time? The plot revolves around some doofus trying to find his wife's killer, but not like Mannix. He stumbles about in a haze due to the fact that he has no long term memory: &quot;Who are you? Where am I? Oh yeah, I wrote down here somewhere..&quot;<br /> It gets worse, everything is shown backwards, so we see what happens to the goofball in the end, which is the beginning, but it does'nt matter. By the end of the film, which is the beginning, you really don't care about anyone in this forgettable film. I was asking myself the same questions as the main character. And I wanted a drink.<br />A complete waste of time.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This movie to me, was a masterpiece. It was true genius in it's message, the way it was told, the way it was lovingly made and so on.  This particular edition celebrates and extends an understanding about the creative process necessary to bring this artistic work about. It was just great. Since watching it several times I have been totally inspired.  Thank you for this wonderful movie and edition.

I suspect most single women are -- except for those who are always completely confident, model-thin and intellectually dazzling. (I don't know those women. Do you?)<br />Told in diary form, this hilarious (and quick-reading) book tells a \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-like story of love and mishaps. Bridget works in a go-nowhere publishing job. She's madly in lust with office scoundrel Daniel and despises Mark Darcy, the divorced lawyer her mother keeps trying to set her up with.<br />Along the way, Bridget drinks and smokes too much, finds a new job that may or may not be better than her old one, helps her parents patch up their own problems, and watches her weight fluctuate wildly. In short: It's just like real life.
0790729407|5.0|This movie was the best I've ever seen concerning The Troubles in Ireland. I would have enjoyed more of the film covering the Easter Revolution, but it did a wonderful job of mixing entertainment with history. Although nearly all of the film was fairly well grounded on fact, I was disappointed in Julia Roberts uninspiring performance.  However Liam Nelson more than compinsated with his masterful job and played Michael Collins exactley the way I would of imagined him to be.  This was an all-around wonderful movie capable of educating the uninformed and inspiring the knowledgeable.
0393317552|4.0|Why are some civilizations more powerful and \\"advanced\\" than others? Seeking a non-racist explanation, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" author Jared Diamond wrote this book.<br />He looks at when different continents were populated. (For example, there were humans in Africa and Europe long before there were humans in Australia.) He looks at the kinds of flora and fauna native to each continent; some spots, he found, had far fewer domesticable plants and animals. He looks at how geographical barriers kept some inventions and ideas from spreading to other areas.<br />There are many charts, graphs and maps that helpfully illustrate his concepts. I would have preferred more photos, as I like to see the people and places I'm reading about.<br />Diamond's writing is generally quite lively and engrossing. There are, however, a few dry spots. Overall, history and sociology buffs will enjoy this book immensely.

0679420266|4.0|I havnt read this book.  Ill buy it perhaps and put it on the <BR>shelf.  Perhaps Ill add it to my wish list and leave it there.<BR>Whats the point.  Or better yet-- Camus, Whats he trying to prove.  I gave this book a four because 4 stars lined up look ok.  I find it somewhat hypocritical that Camus would write this book to influence others.  If he wrote it to publish in order to pay his rent, thats believable.. But if he thought to write a clever well written book to impress others... well it seems rather nonsensical.  If he'd thought the joke was on us... he'd be wrong.  The jokes on him.. and his pointless wasted life.
B000002ADT|4.0|In fact, a book has been written about these legendary sessions. No doubt the musicianship all around is border line genius, and the harmonics and rhythms at the time , over 40 years ago, were unique. In fact, this is said to be by far the best selling jazz record ever, and it keeps selling well with no advertising, even as the pop &quot;hits&quot; since then disappear.There are literaly 100 times more reviews of KIND OF BLUE than for Billie Holiday's LADY IN SATIN, from the same era...Musically, its very crisp, but comes offa bit like riffs on various themes that get tiring after a while. In fact, this is among my least played Miles' albums for that reason. I prefer many others, not least SKETCHES OF SPAIN. All in all though, it holds up very though, as does just about anything byMr. Davis from his late-40's to early 60's period. Give it a try and see what you think!!
B00005UEAR|5.0|If I could give this CD SIX stars I would. Simply incredible. Have had this since the day before the official release as I preordered it. In the week since I have come to realize this is simply one of the greatest works EVER. Both powerful and beautiful, the songs are all winners from the opening to the sustained reverberating note at the end. My jaw hangs open at the musicianship and songwriting. Absolutely perfect. Songs like &quot;Misunderstood&quot;, &quot;Solitary Shell&quot;, and &quot;Blind Faith&quot; remind me why I love music. As a guitarist of nearly 20 years I wish I had written these songs. Besides the awe-inspiring music, there is thought-provoking lyrical content as well.  Whether it's the despairing uncertainties of mental illness addressed in the 42 minute title track or the issue of using stem cells in research, debated in the 13 minute track &quot;The Great Debate&quot;, DT is not afraid to tackle tough topics in their songs. If there was any justice in this world, works like SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULANCE would be grammy shoe-ins instead of the bubble-gum pop of N'Sync and their ilk. If you are reading this, run, don't walk, to get your credit card and get this CD now!
B00004SGNJ|5.0|Every cut here is close to a masterpiece, except the nine-plus minute END OF A LOVE AFFAIR: AUDIO STORY, simply a recording of the whole session, talk and all. I'M A FOOL TO WANT YOU, one of Sinatra's all time greats is done here, is given the royal treatment in three takes by Billie and Ray Ellis in a very beautiful version. But the whole CD is of this high quality, and you'll never hear another voice quite like this one, even if a little shaky. This is Lady Day towards the very end, one of her last recordings. A must hear!!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks has put out the best recording of her career with &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La.&quot; Finally all the pieces of her life have seemed to come together - sobriety, peace with Fleetwood Mac, peace with her past, wonderful music, great producers, and great lyrics. What I especially love about this CD is that Stevie has finally given to the world songs that she wrote many years ago (Sorcerer, Planets of the Universe). Although this recording was (unfairly) looked over by Grammy for the best rock album, Stevie was nominated for best female rock vocal for &quot;Planets of the Universe.&quot;  She deserves it, and I hope she wins. Her collaborations with Sheryl Crow on this CD are also terrific - especially &quot;Sorcerer.&quot;  I hope these two great rock artists continue to work together in the future - they do create magic together!

0312243022|5.0|This novel is NOT a disservice to Virginia Woolf. It is, on the contrary, one of the highest compliments. But, putting aside the comparisons to Woolf, this novel stands on it's own merits from a post-modernist, post-formalist perspective. Its allusions, ironies, metaphors, and displacement make for an engrossing, almost hypnotic read. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates masterfully-written contemporary fiction.
0767849493|5.0|Dogma is rather a brave movie because it deals with the Cathlic Church. Kevin Smith set out with this film to question his own Cathlic faith and does a really good job with it.

But I was so amazed by his music that I bought the whole album!<br />After a I wanna to see the live concert of him, so we called some shops, and we found the vhs of the live concert. I was a whole new experience when I saw the vhs. The violins, the bass-guiter. So I wanna have the dvd too!<br />I found the dvd in the 'Private Years box', so I order it. A few weeks later the box arrived at my door. It was very exciting. But when I saw the dvd I was a little dissapointment. <br />The sound-effects are really good, but the video-quality is poor. The images are al little bit 'sheaky'. I think that they are used the wrong aquipment to put it on dvd. <br />But Yanni is still amazing, and I have already six cds of him :-)

076790382X|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed reading this book!  And I can honestly say that no book has ever made me laugh harder.  At one point, I was reading it while on an all-night flight and had to keep putting the book down because my laughs were waking up the people around me.  I really did find it that funny!<br />Humor aside, As an ex-pat American living in London I related and agreed with so many of the points that Bryson makes about the two countries.  He's absolutely hit the nail on the head with this book and kept me laughing throughout.  If you're thinking about reading this book...definitely do!
B00004R99J|5.0|I'm not sure how to express how I feel about this movie.  I just love it and I'm not sure if I can say exactly why.  It is beautiful. If you don't love this movie I understand, it is different from any other Disney cartoon, but that is what I love about it.  The animation style seems different but it is wonderful.  I felt like I was enjoying beautiful scenery and had to remind my self that it was only animation. And the way that Pocahontus moves is so gracful it's like a dance. The score is the best score of any Disney film.  Especailly the songs.  With few exceptions, every song is beautiful and moving.  Highlights are &quot;Just Around the Riverbend,&quot; &quot;If I Never Knew You&quot; (only in the end credits, more on that later) and of course &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;  <br />The character of Pocahontas and John Smith are some of the strongest and most real characters ever developed by Disney.  There love is real.  At the time I saw this movie I was falling in love for the first and only time with the man that is now my husband, and when I watch this movie I was thinking &quot;That's how I feel!&quot;  My only complaint is that one of the best parts of the movie and love story ended up on the cutting room floor.  There is a love song, &quot;If I Never Knew You&quot; between John Smith and Pocahontas, sung by Mel Gibson (he's really great) and Judy Kuhn(the best ever).  And somehow someone thought that it wasn't good enough for the movie.  This, I don't understand.  It brought me to tears.  I was hoping that the DVD version would include this song but, sadly it didn't.  Maybe for the next realease. . . I loved it anyway!  It's a beautiful story. It is not historically correct, but then the Little Mermaid didn't follow the story correctly either and there's another classic.  Buy this one and watch it with someone you love,  I'm telling you it's one of the best love stories ever.  One last side note.  It you love this one DO NOT watch the sequel.  It ruins everything and shatters the illusion that you are left with when this movie ends.
0380788624|1.0|The only thing I can find to praise about this book is consistency.  It's about as engrossing after page 10 as it is after page 890.  (&amp; I kept thinking it had to get better!)  This is shear pointless verbosity without a single human-like character or sympathetic plot element.  Stephenson can just about make the reader not care about the outcome of WWII.
B00005S8FC|5.0|The best house album in 2001. Most innovative sound, tango with frenchy deep house rythm. Bandoleon harmonic sound mixed up with electronic drums and basses. Perfect i reccomend especially Capitalismo Forneo. Tango Rules!
0790729725|1.0|I'm only writing this review so I can add my name to the list of disapointment for this DVD. Goodfellas is my favorite movie of all time. In my opinion its one of the best movies ever made so what up with this terrible DVD? No special feautres and you have to flip the disc in the middle of the movie? It would be really cool to see a special addition or a Criterion Collection of this movie. This is one of the few where I'd rather watch the Video.  So I give the Movie 5 stars I give the DVD Zero
B00002SWEM|5.0|wim wenders together with ry cooder has created what thousands of latin music friends where waiting for. a tender review of the greatest and most important musicans of the cuban scene. from their age they are old, but considering their never lost capacity of playing their instruments, their statements, their way of life, their happyness performing with ry and the guys - they all have stayed young at heart. this film is an important contribution to the musical understanding between &quot;different&quot; cultures. the mixture of fantastic songs and sound, great camera, close ups, lively interviews and nice shots from the cuban scenery makes it a film, that you will watch again and again, alone or with good friends to enjoy a bit of &quot;latin felling&quot;. light yourself a good cuban cigar, get some goooood glasses of rum &quot;havanna club&quot; lean back and enjoy.<BR>fabulous.
0783240287|5.0|Having been disappointed by several filmed musicals, I used to think that musical adaptation for film could hardly work.  But this DVD has changed my view and I now believe a good musical can be as great on a small screen as on a big stage. <BR>It is simply amazing how Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber could transform Bible story into contemporary fable.  This production amazes me with its wonderful cast, great choreography, and excellent staging.  It is truly a dazzling production, fulfilling the satisfaction of your ears and eyes to the ultimate.  It certainly has its tricks to attract small kid's attention. My two little boys love it.  This is the only show, besides \\"Power Ranger\\" and \\"SpongeBob\\", which can make them sit through and watch it again and again.<BR>The music score is enchanting (like all Andrew Lloyd Webber music), especially versatile, and full of fun.  Donny Osmond is perfect for Joseph and delivers the best \\"Close Every Door\\" among all the other Joseph's.  Maria Friedman is very good as narrator.  Besides her unique voice, her acting is natural and just right for the role. The eleven jealous brothers' comical performance in country, French caf music, and calypso are marvelous and couldn't be more entertaining.  They definitely add a yummy topping to the show.  Another masterstroke is the impersonation of pharaoh (King) with \\"Elvis-the King\\", which is absolutely brilliant and witty.<BR>My family has been enjoying this DVD since it arrived.  The more we watched, the more we love it.  We are so deep in love with this joyful show that it's come to the point that every song means, and every nuance matters.
B00003CXTG|1.0|To take something as monumentally important to history as the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and surround it with a beyond-silly love story and completely implausible characters makes this movie more than bad. This film is downright offensive.<br />I'm a fan of special effects and action films, but I don't quite see why anyone would be &quot;cheered,&quot; &quot;amazed&quot; or &quot;enthralled&quot; by the attack scenes in this. This really happened, after all. People, by the hundreds, died in the most horrific of ways, and, I'm sorry, watching Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett run around pumping their fists and gunning down Japanese planes didn't make me feel &quot;pro-American.&quot; It made me think that the filmmakers were exploiting an event that's clearly beyond their artistic grasp and manipulating it to make a film that they think the &quot;American public&quot; would digest.<br />Luckily, this dismal, badly-written and completely silly film essentially failed to make any money, which reaffirms my faith in American tastes a bit.
B00005214X|5.0|I've been a beatles fan for most of my life, but have only recently been exposed to All Things Must Pass.  A freind was listening to it - and i immediately loved it.  It quickly ended up in my top ten.  George Harrison and his talent laden crew - have put together one of the most heart-felt, somber, and entertaining album that I've ever heard.
0312932081|5.0|I got this novel as a gift from a friend about a year ago. I started reading it and I have to say that initially, I was not incredibly impressed with it. Then, I picked it up again and finished it off. The introduction was powerful (apparently, the novel is used in some military schools and several child prodigies have thoroughly identified with Ender) and there was an element in me that just wanted to read the novel to find out if all the hype was true; in large part, it is true.<br />The background of the novel is that humanity has withstood two alien invasions (by the \\"buggers\\") and has temporally united to fight them again. I liked that fact that this was another utopian world government; there is still political friction on Earth despite the war. Due to the fact that humanity is overwhelmingly outgunned and outnumbered, a genetic engineering program has been implemented to produce an ideal military commander.<br />One family, the Wiggins, have had three children altered for the program. Peter is manipulative, cruel and destructive. Valentine is wise but lacks the hardness that a successful commander needs. The third and youngest, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is the family's last hope. When he is only very young (around 6), the military recruits him for military school.<br />Following this is Ender's journey to become a commander. He is pushed very hard to succeed. He is manipulated, put into fights, and just plain pressured to do well. Ender is then propelled through military school at an unheard of pace, but he learns to be innovative, how to trust his commanders and how to be a good leader.<br />However, Ender's brother and sister are busy with other plans. Together, they become influential on Earth's networks, writing columns and slowly becoming powerful. Eventually, Peter becomes Hegemon (this is position is similar to the US Presidency but with much more territory) and Valentine leaves Earth with Ender to found human colonies on the former bugger worlds.<br />Oneof the ways in which I measure novels is the way I feel after I finish it. I had a very satisfied feeling upon finishing and I immediately went out to buy the sequel, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" (which according to the author, can also be read as a stand-alone novel) and plan to read it soon. Throughout the novel, there is great commentary on the nature of power and what military training can do to a person. In addition it is fascinating to see that when a society feels threatened it will do anything to preserve itself. In this novel, that means a genetic engineering program and putting young children (6-18) into military training and thence battle. Indeed, after the final victory in the novel, the adults say that only children could win the battles as adult response time and other factors would be too slow and adults would be over cautious.<br />This is one highly recommended novel and you need not be a science fiction reader to enjoy it. The characterization and motivations of the characters alone make the novel worth reading.
B00003CX6P|5.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley. I was unable to see it in the theater, and now I'm sorely kicking myself for it. I rented it one night and I was hooked. The story intrigued me. I knew that Tom Ripley was not the person he seemed to be, but I couldn't figure out why. The subtle clues in the movie...sent chills down my spine. The clues given throughout the movie are excellent. And the cast helps the screenplay and locations 110%. Jude Law, Gwenneth Paltrow, Phillip Seymore Hoffman and Cate Blanchet are excellent. They took some liberties from the book, but I didn't care. Matt Damon made Tom Ripley come alive with the subtle creepyness. He made me debate about his psycho crimes and desires. I never truely felt he was in the wrong. Isn't that what a good psychological thriller is supposed to do? I think it is, and The Talented Mr. Ripley accomplishes its goal of unsettling the viewer. So come with your brains in the \\"on\\" positiuon, or you'll miss it.
B00005TT77|5.0|After seeing I am Sam, I just had to have the soundtrack. All of the songs fit perfectly with the movie. It is one of those rare movies that after watching it, you want to become a better person. This cd is a must have for your collection.
B00004XONN|5.0|I didn't really &quot;get&quot; 'O.K. Computer.' It had some nice tunes on it but, with the exception of &quot;Paranoid Android,&quot; I really didn't see what was so groundbreaking about the music. However, this album is most definitely a work of art, and it's actually more accessible than their previous album. If you didn't like 'O.K. Computer,' don't give up on the band altogether. That was just the transitional phase as Radiohead metamorphosized into what it is today.
0451196716|5.0|I was never one for fiction until about 15 years ago when I read The Long Walk. I have since read hundreds of books, and I think this is still my favorite. King is always better when he keeps within the paramaters of the possible, like The Body, and Shawshank. I have recently re-read this horror story, and it holds up to my first impression. It also reminds me how disapointing books like the Stand are when a perfectly possible story is ruined by the loss of all sense of reality.This is the book you give to an adult who says he finds reading fiction boring.
0783226063|1.0|Why? Because it's the version that's missing almost fifty minutes of footage! I saw the three hour-plus version on Sci-Fi Channel, and for the very first time on the original Disney Channel which showed more adult films late at night! What I saw of the 137 Minute version takes a good amount of the story out! Trust me, wait for the three hour version! You'll see that it's worth it! Grade: F
B00005U1YO|5.0|I bought this CD at midnight and have listened to it 6 times already today. The Chems have put out what is by far their most danceable album yet. If you haven't heard the first 2 singles &quot;Star Guitar&quot; and &quot;It Began In Afrika&quot; then you haven't been clubbing lately, have you? If you're wondering if the entire album lives up to the hype the answer is yes! There are ten tracks, other notables are &quot;Come with us&quot; which is very dance friendly big beat song, with many weird noises and effects and sci-fi sounding samples. The down-tempo &quot;The state we're in&quot; is beuatiful and flows very smoothly, reminds me of good trip-hop of the song &quot;asleep from the day&quot; off of the last Chems CD. A must have for most electronic music fans collection.
B00004ZD69|2.0|Note how most of the folks reviewing this thing can't help but gush endlessly about it - were it not for the 1000-word limit there would be some novels posted here.<br />That's kind of how the music is... blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I tend to go on autopilot every time I listen to it. Maybe some unknown piece of my subconscious is digging it though...
630521610X|5.0|Scream is the ultimate horror movie. Not only is it a new idea and formula to the horror genre but it manages to make you laugh at the same time. It has a killer cast and a genius script. The characters could not get any better and the movie as a whole could not be more entertaining!! Scream for me gave horror a new lease of life. Its perfect for this generation and provides us with the hip, cool and scary elements often missed out in previous horror movies. Scream is a total SCREAM!! Whats your favourite scary movie? and Are you alone in the house? will be legendary quotes for a long time to come.
6301334523|1.0|I approached Dangerous Liasons. I had liked the fun of Cruel Intentions but had heard how paltry that movie was when compared to the \\"amazing\\" Dangerous Liasons and when I finished watching it I could not believe it.<br />John Malcovich was absolutley appaling...and for the life of me I could find no charm...and I could see no change, I found his portrayal of his characters change to someone who was in love to be as bad as Ben Affleck's attempt at becoming a more caring man in 'Bounce'.<br />I found the sets that everyone kept on raving about to be colourless and rather dull. Sarah Michelle Gellar was criticised heavily for her portrayal of being cruel and heartless...but Glenn Close...she had no charisma and no appeal.<br />Uma Thurman was lovely as always but I found the way the director tackled her miscarriage to be depressing and awful.<br />All in all I would never ever want to watch it again...I wanted to turn it off with each approaching scene but in the end I subjected myself to the torture of watching Malcovich repeating \\"its out of my control\\" or something like that and the ridiculous end duel scene.
B00002DE2T|5.0|this is by far my favorite thrash album.the exodus live shows in the &quot;baloff era&quot; were pure thrash performed with skill and heart.<BR>i like the other exodus stuff after paul baloff left but this remains the true classic album of all time. it was recorded on a shoe string budget but still sounds very good.paul passed away 2-2-2002 from a massive stroke. the original line up had reunited a few years back and recorded a live album(another lesson in violence)and just played the chuck billy(testament)tribute earlier this year.paul was a very cool dude,a classic frontman ,and a true god of thrash metal. rest well my brother of metal.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Russell Crowe really makes you believe he IS the character John Nash.  Excellent acting.  Coming from a person who is disabled by Bipolar Disorder I can totally relate and it is a realistic view of the mind of a schizophrenic. I saw it twice and then bought the book.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|A movie that totally engulfs you: you laugh, you cry, the music is amazing.  It took the flu for me to finally see this movie.. i had seen clips and pieces here and there and never thought I could sit through the entire thing.. Im so glad i did.  All of the cast is wonderful.. the music is beautful, and the story is timeless.  If you love great broadway plays, you will admire this greatly.  If on broadway, this would be my new favorite.  Kidman is great, macgregor is equally great, and the supporting cast is marvelous.  This is a definate MUST SEE just due to the fact it is not your typical movie, but a journey into music and acting.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|the best of the songs from moulin rouge. a great cd that you have to buy!
B000000993|5.0|Maynard...Maynard...Maynard...why did you have to hook me on your voice, pulling me into your wonderful songs and making me see your lyrics? All i can say, is that this cd is absolutely amazing! TooL is probably one of the best bands on the planet, and has a very defined fan-base that shows you just how devoted the fans are.<br />Undertow is no exception to their genius. With songs like \\"prison sex\\", or \\"sober\\", the cd is definately full of TooL's best. Their lyrics, instrumentals, everything is one of the best in the industry. TooL has been around for awhile, and if they keep putting out cd's of this quality, they will be around for much, much longer.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This album is significant in many ways:<br />Moby licensed out every song on the album, a rarity in today's day and age.  As a matter of fact, it had a lot of people complaining that he had \\"sold out.\\"  As he put it, he wants his music to be heard by the masses.  Moby can license out all his music because it is just that good.  I love this CD as the music content varies dramatically from some serene music with no vocals to others that are beats with orchestras and his voice to others that are full blown instrumentation.  Additionally, his use of other artists with his beats shows his ear for music.<br />Moby is not a \\"synth/keyboard freak\\" as many just assume his success is due to his keyboarding capability.  This guy knows how to put together music and the production of this album was phenomenal.  If you want a great bang for the buck album with many songs you have heard on the radio/commercials buy this.  You won't be disappointed.  I hope his next album rocks as much as this one as I have thoroughly enjoyed this one.<br />Listen to the above tracks........you will find you notice over 1/2 of these songs even if you aren't a Moby fan.......<br />1. Honey<br />2. Find My Baby<br />3. Porcelain<br />4. Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad<br />5. South Side<br />6. Rushing<br />7. Bodyrock<br />8. Natural Blues<br />9. Machete<br /> 10. 7<br />11.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|This has got to be the BEST soundtrack ever.  Forget all that extra music spent on scores.  This has got the REAL music from the movie.  There is a little variation in the songs directly from the movie but not enough to effect the richness of the songs.  And as a break from the bitter-sweet love songs, you've got a little extra sweetness.  Christina A, Lil' Kim, Maya, &amp; Pink in &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, Bono in &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; and you'll fall in love with the flowing melody of &quot;Complainte de la Butte&quot;.  You've got the upbeat sounds of Fatboy Slim.  And they don't give away every song in the movie! So you still have a reason to by the DVD!
B00000DHRX|5.0|If you are straight or gay listen up. EVERYONE LOVES THIS CD. I've had this album borrowed by tons of friends. I personally listen to disc 1 to unwind after a stressful day but I have yet to find a woman that doesn't love listening to this CD. Most guys would rather discuss whether George is gay or straight but the reality is that the music is great. No one should deny that.<br />I love this collection and personally listen to disc 1 entitled \\"for the heart\\" much more than disc 2 which is entitled \\"for the feet.\\" As the titles imply disc 1 is a compilation of Mr. Michael's best slow songs and disc 2 is a compilation of the more dance-oriented, upbeat songs.<br />If there was any complaint I had about the album it was in disc 1 with the order of the songs and the tempo. While the songs are more love oriented they go up and down in tempo, which I didn't care for so I burned ...onto my computer and reorganized it and then burnt it onto a blank CD. LOL. Songs on disc 1 include: \\"Jesus to a Child\\", \\"Father Figure\\", the slow jazz tune \\"Kissing a Fool\\", and a beautiful cover of Bonnie Raitt's \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\". My personal song on the album is \\"you have been loved.\\"<br />I won't discuss disc 2 much but on a bang for the buck basis this album ranks WAY up there in my opinion. BUY IT NOW! What are you waiting for? Heck, listen to it on the links above. You can't lose!

B00003CXXI|4.0|Shrek (Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, 2001)<br /><br />Shrek is the consummate fairytale, a sendup of hundreds of fairy tales that have come before while still being one  itself. It also has one of the finest endings in modern filmmaking, but by the time you get there, that's almost beside the point; you've had so much fun on the journey  that you hate to see it end.<br /><br />Shrek (Mike Myers) is your typical fairytale ogre. He's big, green, and scares the natives. His fondest wish is to  be left alone in his swamp to live his life in peace. That wish, however, is tossed to the wind when Shrek first meets Donkey, who is, surprisingly enough, a talking donkey (Eddie  Murphy), and then later that day finds out that the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is evicting fairy tale creatures, all of whom are taking up residence in Shrek's swamp.  Shrek heads off to see Lord Farquaad to work something out, and is given the following deal: rescue the fair Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and you'll get your swamp back. Of  course, Farquaad has his own plans...<br /><br />Nothing new here. Just combine the usual saving-the-princess-from-the-dragon fairytale with the frog-prince  fairytale (where your hero isn't Prince Charming) and you've got a good idea of what's going on. The ending, while somewhat surprising at first blush, is also pretty standard  fairytale fare. (That doesn't make it any less great. After all, we all knew how Before Night Falls was going to end, too.) What separates Shrek from the usual fairytale fare, and makes  it equally palatable to adults and kids, is that preternatural combination of adult-themed humor and kid-friendly animation that, while still too rarely seen, is starting to  become more common. Add the House of Pacific Data to the short list of folks who are capable of pulling it off, and eagerly await their next picture. Hopefully, it'll be this good.  ****
6302581907|4.0|In a tailor-made role, Whoopi Goldberg stars as a Motown lounge-singer in Reno who witness the murder of a chauffeur at the hands of her married boyfriend and mobster, Harvey Kietel.  When she goes to the police, they need to hide her some place safe, and they find a place where no one would think to look for the mistress-singer ... a convent.  Maggie Smith also stars as the Mother Superior who agrees to shelter the newly christened Sister Mary Clarence, and in the hands of Whoopi, you can guess what happens to their woefully inadequate choir.  This is one of those films it's hard not to like.  The role was made for Whoopi, and she plays it for all it's worth.  The nuns are all cute, the fish out of water story has built in laughs, and the music is terrific - really gets the toes tapping.  There's nothing deep or earth shattering here, and thank God for that.  It's simply a film about singing out your joy and serving others.  In other words, it's a feel good movie and a lot of fun.
0345350499|4.0|&quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is much more than a simple reformulation of the traditional Authurian legends.  First, it is one of the premier fantasy novels of the late 20th century.  Not only does it successful incorporate most of the themes of the fantasy genre, but it also sets a new standard by which all later works will be judged.  I was particularly impressed with the way Marion Zimmer Bradley was able to incorporate all the elements of the Arthurian myths in such a unique and creative way.  Second, there is no denying that the book is a significant statement of feminist philosophy.  Bradley carefully explores the transition from matriarchal to patriarchal society with the advent of civilization.  At times I felt like I was reading textbooks from my college Women's Studies courses.  Third, &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; explores the rise of Christianity and its inevitable clash with pagan religions.  Here is where I thought the book stumbled.  Bradley spends most of the book exploring the idea that Christianity was intolerant of other religious beliefs and aggressively sought to eradicate them.  I found the ending (which I won't reveal) inconsistent with Bradley's formulation of Christianity and the beliefs of Avalon.  Nevertheless, there are many layers to this beautifully crafted novel.  Whatever their personal philosophy or beliefs, readers will be challenged by the multitude of viewpoints.  My biggest complaint about the novel is that I felt it could have used a better editor.  I love long, complex books, but this is a story that could have been told in 450-600 pages, not the 800+ of my paperback edition.  When I found myself getting bogged down in the middle of the book, I skipped about 100 pages and didn't feel like I'd missed a thing in terms of plot, character development or theme.
B00004Z459|5.0|The Title Explains it all.  I have never heard a band as fantastic as Linkin park.  They do everything a musical band should.  They Rap, they Rock, they're great at turntablism, they are like a Next Generation Limp Bizkit.  Mike Shinoda Raps, Chester Bennington sings, Joseph Hahn is the DJ, and behind them they have a full band.  They are my favorite band, released my favorite CD, and my favorite song(A Place for my Head).  I'm hoping these guys will be around for a long time.
B00000IO4J|4.0|This teen horror is scripted by Kevin 'Scream' Williamson, and it shows.  This movie is full to the brim with knowing nods and winks to sci-fi and horror that true fans of the genre will appreciate.  The plot is basic enough, group of teens battle against their teachers and peers as they gradually become a set of mute, apparently perfect clones.  Yet this version of 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is both original and clever in that it pits its kids not only against the clones but against each other as the slowly-decreasing inner group is riven by suspicion and paranoia.  'The Faculty' also manages to allude to 'The Breakfast Club' with the group of teens basically being a geek (Wood), a prom queen, a jock, a goth and the new girl.  This witty device manages to increase the tension, which is edged up very effectively and old set pieces such as the almost obligatory 'chase through the school corridors' scene is fresh and exciting.<br />Rodriguez has also managed to assemble a smart young cast, many of who are now rapidly rising in the industry.  Wood proves that he is more than able to carry a movie with his likeably geeky hero whilst Hartnett (giving evidence of his later stellar performance in 'The Virgin Suicides') and Duvall (last seen in TV's 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' as the invisible girl, as well as indie flick 'But I'm A Cheerleader') give able support.<br />Some of the central ideas are also very clever, such as that the government planned conspiracy thrillers such as 'Men In Black' in order to cover up the real conspiracy.  Whilst 'The Faculty' can't really be labled a true classic, it is an interesting piece that is more than a cut above others in its genre.
0446678430|1.0|If &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; is a brilliant success, this one is a brilliant FAILURE.  The theme is very loose, and it seems the author has nothing to say anymore, especially after all these rich dad, poor dad series.  I cannot find the theme coherence of the whole book, and the author is just selling / marketing (again) all his previous titles.

B000003TB6|5.0|If you're a neophyte or a long-time fan of hip-hop, this album has something to offer. By far the best example of the boundaries of hip-hop, &quot;Do you want more???&quot; is the opus of the Roots. Not to say that their other albums don't hold muster (because they do), but this was truly the best the collective had to offer. The anthem of the Roots is &quot;What goes on,&quot; which combines the talents of their drummer, ?uestlove, their then-beat boxer Rahzel (since aptly replaced by Scratch) and their MCs, Black Thought and Malik B to create a world of rap in which one could exist forever. Other notable songs on the album include &quot;Mellow my man,&quot; which exemplifies the tempo changes that are the hallmark of jazz, &quot;The lesson,&quot; a freestyle-type song over an incredible beatbox courtesy of Rah, and &quot;Distortion to static,&quot; one of those songs that becomes an immovable force in one's head. If you love music and creativity, this is the one album you must own.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I've seen many \\"Director's Cuts\\" movies, and this one together with Blade Runner, is one of the best re-releases I've ever seen.<BR>Not the brightest star on the sky, but the most coherent and respectful of the original motion picture. Yes, in Blade Runner, so can see a real change on the movies plot, but here the original plot is \\"enhanced\\". To get new scenes with CGI, but retainig even the film grain of the original, is really a hard work!!. You can see through the film that some scenes have been cleaned, others retouched, and so on, so when you get the big picture on the movie, you just say wow!. One important thing: all the new and enhanced scenes were in the original storyboards, so what you see now is the movie that should have been originally. You have to see it to tell if I'm wright or not...
6301008960|5.0|An 80's teen romantic comedy that you can watch over and over again. There is more to the story being told than money cant buy you love. I think a deeper message to this story is no matter how life changes and the world around you changes dont get caught up in all.  Stay who you are and true to yourself and everything will work out in the end.  On another note Im very happy that Buena Vista Home Entertainment is finally going to put this movie out on DVD this summer.  So to all of you Can't Buy Me Love fans out there lets hope they include some special features.  I myself would love to hear a commentary from Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson and some deleated scenes.  There is not much info from Buena Vista other than its being released this summer. ...
B00005JKHP|5.0|I was not prepared to like this DVD as much as I do. I fondly remember the theatrical opening of ST;TMP in Dec '79, and as a 14 year old, still able to watch the syndicated re-runs of the original series, I was blown away by the special effects and sound.<br />But the movie has not aged well, and has been eclipsed by not only other sci-fi genre movies, but by subsequent ST sequels.<br />The editing by Mr Wise, the enhanced special effects, and the skillful sound re-mastering have revitalized this movie. It still has the a problem with derivative plot lines and wooden dialogue, but ST faithful won't care. This movie plays beautifully. I even played my VHS copy and the DVD simutaneously, and kept switching back and forth to see what a startling difference there is. A must see for the Star Trek faithful!
B000002IST|1.0|I haven't heard this entire monstrosity in a long time but the title track is enough to make me run full speed and you should too.  It may not be fair because there may be some hidden gems here but I'm not going to risk it because of that incipid title tune and its even worse video.  This doesn't even deserve the name of Genesis on it.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|Don't believe the hype.  Memento is a stinker of the highest order.  I just feel sympathy for the actors.  <br />Guy Pearce, with his smoldering Australian good looks and poofed up dyed blonde hair could have been the perfect neo-noir icon- a smart educated rebel appealing to both indie types and mass audiences. But the film provides him with no edge, when that's clearly what he's screaming for. Leonard, the memory challenged hero of Memento, is simply too nice. \\"See, I have this condition with my memory...\\" he says with a semi-eager-to-please puppy dog look in his eyes. And the script has him say this over and over again, sometimes for laughs. Pearce isn't allowed to act a complex character; he's barely even veangeful when his revenge for the death of his wife is what is fueling the movie. The opposite is true for the equally potentially magnetic, Carrie Anne-Moss. She's way too mean. Any amount of decency was abandoned by her character for no reason other than to play out yet another relentlessly gimmicky scene of backwards story telling. <br />The cinemotography and production values for Memento are also sub-par. The atomsphere for Memento should be dark and smokey with dense, well-lit visuals. Instead, the color scheme is bland and sunny and one scene actually takes place, with no irony, in a Bill Knapps. Bill Knapps! In fact there are only three locales mainly: a bar, a house, and a motel, and each looks like it was shot near a suburban strip mall. I have a suggestion for independent filmmakers- never shoot a movie near Arizona. Ever. The bland and flat cinemotography typical of indies mixed with suburban locales interspersed with a few cacti here and there is about the most depressing combination since Sylvia Plath met an oven.<br />Despite these stylistic mistakes, Memento's heart is in the wrong place. The characters that are introduced as good who we like and are rooting for for the whole film are actually bad, and the characters that are bad who we hate for almost all of the film turn out to be good. It'd be like the end of Indiana Jones if you found out that the bespectacled Nazi is really the good guy and Indiana is just looking for the arc of the covenant because he has nothing better to do. Of course, Memento isn't even interesting up till the stinkbomb of an end anyway. <br />footnote: There's so much confusion by fans of this movie as to how to \\"unlock\\" the secrets of Memento.  Hate to say it folks but this film isn't high-reaching enough to contain anything complex enough that it would confuse. At first the combination of telling a story backwards and a plot about a man with memory problems would lead one to believe that the filmmakers could have paralleled the timeline with Leonard's delayed memory.  Disapointingly, Memento's backwards story telling is actually completely irrelevant to Leonard's memory plight and is not an enhancer, but a gimmick.  A gimmick!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Bought this album around September/November 2001,  I didnt really know what to expect having only seen the One Armed Scissor<BR>video on MTV.  Put it on the stereo and was blown away, 12 tracks of Pure Brilliance(mine has catacombs the extra track)I dont think I have heard a band with such energy before I keep trying (as I suppose people have to do) to try and compare ATDI with another band, but I just can't.<br />At the same time I bought ....Trail of Dead's album, a good buy if anyones interested. Now I have just purchased In casino out & Acrobatic Tenement and I cant wait till I receive them. <br />Just buy this album NOW trust me you wont regret it!!!!
B000002U82|5.0|One of the biggest selling albums of all time, Dark Side Of The Moon is Floyd at their creative best. It's a pitty that the albums between Animals and Momentary Lapse Of Reason never followed the same method of having ALL FOUR men put their oars in the water.<br />Lyrically Roger Waters is on the top of his game. Musically Rick Wright and Dave Gilmour are also on the ball here and even Nick Mason does his bit (the lengthy percussion intro to &quot;Time&quot; is excellent).<br />All the songs are at least above average and Time, Money and Any Colour you like are downright excellent.<br />The ONLY hiccup on the album is the dreadfull On The Run. But considering the rest of the material is SO GOOD we'll forgive it.
B000002J1H|5.0|It is hard for me to read bad reviews from this masterpiece.  Either you like Yes or you don't.  And this album is Yes at is best.  Every song in this album is great with the exception of Turn of the Century and Awaken which are just out of this world.  This album is very moody and somber and maybe that is why people are turned off by it.  If you haven't listened to this album do yourself a big favor and buy it immediately.
0871137380|5.0|The investigator journalist Mark Bowden has wrote the one of the most realistic books that I have ever read. All the details of the rangers that fought defending the so called D-boys(Delta Force or Team) to capture Lt. of the warlord. The operation went wrong at some point. If I were you, I would order this book right now. You wont regret it, honestly.<BR>The book does not only talk about the fight, it talks about the background of the soldiers and the people that were there.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I enjoy watching movies, not as much as some, but more than most. Most movies will slip in and out of my mind. I'll see it on a Friday night and forget about it by next Friday. Oh, I may recall seeing the movie years later when it's brought up in conversation, but for the most part, it remains archived in my mind in the dimly lit, seldom visited corner. <br />Then there are some movies I can never forget, and don't want to. Mulholland Drive is one of them. However long I live, when someone asks me to list my favorite movies of all time, I have no doubt that this will be on that list. Melodramatic statements aside, yes, I like it that much.<br />At first viewing, the movie is a collection of strange, eerie scenes, some of which are hauntingly beautiful. Initially, I was utterly confused (as were most). But after some hard thinking, I made the connection between the first and second part of the movie. There is a point to the movie; there is a story; there is a meaning. And understanding the movie with that perspective elevates it from a quirky, but strangely compelling visual spectacle to a  masterpiece. In the end, Mulholland Drive is a common, tragic story, told in a novel way. It's worth taking the time to think about it; even doing a web-search on analysis of the movie if it doesn't make sense. The epiphany is worth the time spent. <br />The great movies are the ones where, after it is done, you sit in your seat and say, \\"Why can't more movies be like this?\\" The great movies make you realize how un-great most movies are. Mulholland Drive is one of those great movies.<br />-Mark
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Upon first viewing the movie, I was blown away by the visual aspects and was not consciously aware of the entrancing music.  However, I found myself humming the theme of the Shire several days later without actually remembering the music impacting me!  Upon watching the movie a second time, I was more acutely aware of how well the music carries the events and emotions of the film.  The music subtly pulls the viewer along on Tolkien's epic adventure, allowing the viewer to participate in the emotions of the characters and be a part of the journey from the party in Shire to battle on Amon Hen (where the first movie ends).  <BR>I was hooked; I bought the soundtrack, love it, and still listen to it practically non-stop.  Viewing the movie a third time (yes, I am obviously a HUGE fan), after listening to the soundtrack countless times, I was more aware of the music carrying the events movie, but no less moved by the impact of the music.  Furthermore, &quot;May it Be&quot; by Enya embodies all the feeling and emotion I believe Tolkien meant to convey in his epic trilogy, and Peter Jackson and Howard Shore also captured this feeling in the movie and soundtrack. Kudos to Howard Shore, this is truly an emotional and heroic soundtrack for an equally emotional and heroic movie.

The events in the first part have to be taken in \\"dream context\\". Look at it in that perspective and then try to form connections between dream and reality. That's the beauty of this film. Example: notice the name of the director when it's Betty and the old guy, and the name of the director said during the dinner party. Same name, Bob Brooker. Now, why did he say what he did in the dream sequence? Hmmmm.... MD is left to multiple interpretations of the small scenes as well as the movie as a whole. MD still generates thoughts and theories even when other movies, even other good movies, don't haunt my mind at all.That is why I love this movie...
0525946284|4.0|Going back to the era of his best work - WWII, Follett comes up with a winner this time. He knows the period well and the detailed descriptions of conditions in wartime England and France feel authentic. <br />JACKDAWS opens in 1944 just prior to the allied invasion of Normandy. Female English spy Felicity 'Flick' Clariet and her French Resistance husband Michel are participating in an sabotage attack on a German telephone exchange. The plan goes sour and they are the only two to escape. Michel is injured. <br />That's the setup for the story - the return of Flick to France to finish the job. We follow Flick as she develops her unusual plan   which relies on cover as domestics and telephone operators. As such it's a small team she recruits, and they're all women. The only qualifying criteria is that they all be fluent in French and know something about engineering and explosives. Half the fun here is in their recruitment - \\"one flirt, one murderess, one safebreaker, one female impersonator, and one awkward aristocrat.\\"<br />The plot is sufficiently well developed with the familiar Follett twists and turns. There is enough deception, duplicity, and danger here to make this quite a satisfying adventure ride. It's been a while but let's hope the famous Follett formula for  entertaining espionage thrillers is back for good.
B00000J8EK|5.0|While this may not be the definitive Chemical Brother's album it is certainly their most accessible and successful album to date.It seemed to cover so many genre's of dance from techno to house,trance to the all star rock mix with a heady array of guest vocalists.<br /> The opener features a strong dance beat with vocoder vocals,long before Daft Punk made them exteremely fashionable again.Track 2 is a total hard house track.Massive in clubs,it's where this track can be appreciated most fully.A heaving drum machine belting out huge beats,backed by throbbing bass electronica and a disaffected female vocalist asking us repeatedly &quot;Who's Under The Influence?&quot;-well with tracks like this I am for starters!The 3rd track features the first of many outstanding contributions of guest vocalists.On this occasion Bernard Sumner manages to make this track a hybrid of all that's good from New Order to the duo themselves.Hope Sandoval,old favourite Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream,Oasis' Noel Gallagher and most amazingly Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue feature on this album.The Donahue track is totally different to anything else on this album.Of the other tracks &quot;The sunshine underground&quot; is this c.d.'s Private Psychedelic Reel-it's an astounding 8 minute piece that builds up quietly and slowly and steadily gains momentum until a spectacular and long climax.It's like the chill out track in the middle of the c.d.The huge hit &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot; is the best commercial dance track ever released by The Chemical Brother's.Based on pure electronica,techno and unusually for them very little distortion you'll find it hard to sit still listening to this track.This is my favourite of their c.d.'s.It may have lacked the cutting edge and freshness of it's predecessor-but it developed their unique sound to it's finest conclusion
0792164903|5.0|This was a really cool flick! It actually was kind of creepy. The acting by Depp,Walken,Jones, Ricci was all great, and of course Burton's unique style of directing made for a visually stunning film as well. The DVD had all the cool extras that I like, such as the making of the film, which incedentally I found mindblowing to learn that they actually designed each tree that you see in the western woods individually. Ths story is obviously about the headless horseman. It shows his origens, I won't give away the ending, just see it for yourself!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This film must rank amongst the very worst high budget films of all times. And even with a 200 million dollar budget they were unable to recreate 1940s warships. Ever wondered why they show the Japanese carrier battle group only for about one second at a time? Because it's a modern U.S. carrier. All the ships in Pearl Harbor (during the overflight scene) are clearly modern, and even for the explosions they used only scarcely camouflaged Spruance class destroyers from the 1970 and Knox class frigates from the 1960s.<br />Combine these horrible and unforgivable anachronisms with ridicolously bad acting, a totally unbelievable and inaccurate story, and so many slow motion shots that it makes you sick and you get a cinematic disaster.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I've seen this film 12 times now (8 at the cinema and 4 at home with the DVD) and it is still a great joy and delight to me.  If I try and analyse why I'm so in love with it - or why it's such a great film - I end up realising that a logical, critical approach doesn't work, and I'm left with the thought that Moulin Rouge is a modern equivalent to a 30s MGM musical: I almost feel that I'm a closet gay man and that the story of Satine and Christian and the Duke and Harold and Toulouse is, when all is said and done, nothing less than \\"fabulous\\".  Critical faculties, and the ability to maintain a detached or ironic perspective, are shattered by glamour, pathos, gorgeous orchestral music, truth, beauty, freedom and, above all, love.<BR>In some ways it's easier to see what's wrong with the film rather than what's so good about it: the story is spare and simple (and corny); there's an excess of frenetic cutting (one Australian reviewer likened watching it to being trapped in an elevator with a circus); and some of the more complex scenes (the \\"Roxanne\\" sequence, and the massive \\"Hindi sad diamonds\\" denouement) almost fall apart under their own weight; but these are minor concerns when placed against the sheer emotionalism and filmic energy of this crazy masterpiece.  Baz Luhrmann has defiantly established himself as a genius -- in an audacious pantheon of genius that includes Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Parker and Orson Welles. <BR>An example of Luhrmann's brilliant touch is his deft combination of humour and pathos: right in the middle of the film's funniest scene (the most outrageous, burlesque take on \\"Like a Virgin\\" you'll ever see) he cuts to a deathly-pale Satine being injected after fainting (I'm not giving anything away -- it is revealed to us at the beginning that Satine is doomed).  The music abruptly changes from the Rogers and Hammerstein-like treatment of \\"Virgin\\" to a few plaintive notes on the piano backed by a muted and ominous orchestra, then it's back to the madness of the Duke and Zidler.  Another example is during the movie's love theme, \\"Come What May\\": we see Eric Satie joined by an ever-increasing number of bald men, sitting around a piano playing a hauntingly sad and spare Satie-ish melody, before we return to the climax of the love song (and once again Luhrmann demonstrates his brilliant touch: this dramatic part of the song is sung in rehearsal, with Satine and the narcoleptic Argentinean in costume, contrasted by numerous extras, stage-hands and sundry others wandering around).<BR>Moulin Rouge is the film where Nicole Kidman really comes into her own.  \\"The Others\\" has reinforced her standing as an exceptional film actress, but in that film she was playing a restricted, neurotic character.  In Moulin Rouge she runs the gamut of emotions from A to Z: she's beautiful, she's sexy, she's doomed, she's in love.  She is just as striking when her face is presented to us as a vision of grief and despair, tears running down her cheeks, as when she is resplendent in gorgeous stage costumes or her \\"seduction outfit\\".<BR>Nicole is the greatest of the stars but McGregor is very good as the young and idealistic Christian: he has genuine charm when he sings \\"Your Song\\" to Satine and there is real pathos with his tears at the shock of Satine's death.  Jim Broadbent is perfect as Harold Zidler, the impresario, who is both manipulative and sympathetic.  Richard Roxburgh is hilarious as the Duke but is also able to invest the mainly caddish role with real complexity, as evinced by his dejected posture after uttering \\"My dear, a little frog\\" to a besotted Satine: while he is the nasty villain - \\"a powerful man\\" with a homicidal manservant Warner - he displays some of the vulnerability of being in love.  Those four - Satine, Christian, the Duke and Harold, are the main characters, but John Leguizamo is charmingly affecting as Toulouse-Lautrec (another small gripe I have with the scenario is that we are never reminded that Toulouse was a painter and a very great painter at that), and there are some juicy cameos by Garry McDonald (who utters the classic line \\"I don't think a nun would say that about a hill\\") and David Wenham, unrecognisable sans beard and with a black wig.<BR>The music is luscious and a real delight: \\"Nature Boy\\" is all pathos and even dread; \\"Your Song\\" is sweepingly romantic and thrilling; \\"The Pitch\\" is spirited mayhem; \\"One Day I'll Fly Away\\" is simply stunningly gorgeous; \\"Elephant Love Medley\\" is excitingly surprising as we recognise the post-modernist take on such pop classics as \\"Heroes\\" and \\"I Will Always Love You\\" (on top of that, Luhrmmann chucks in operatic flourishes willy-nilly); \\"Like a Virgin\\" is a burlesque masterpiece; \\"Come What May\\" is anthemic, corny and irresistible; and \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\" is a thumping dance track set against the most stunning tableau you'll ever see staged.<BR>It's important to get the DVD for the quality of sound and vision.  The extras are many and good but nothing beats just sitting down again, to share with another friend, the joy of this great movie.  I'm looking forward to the next \\"screening\\" already!
B00005UEAR|5.0|As a great dream theater fanatic I was really looking forward to their new disc. I must say that Iam not dissapointed and thats means that the boys from NY did the trick again; they produced another masterpiece thats even better than 'scenes'. <br />Disc 1<br />-the glass prison: the most explosive song DT ever created. Great riffing, great melodies (credits for Jordan here) and briljant guitar and keyboard leads!<BR>-blind faith: nice, more melodic, song. Great melodies and a very cool instrumental section here. Labrie is performing very well on this one<BR>-misunderstood: this songs begins like a ballad but then evolves into very cool symphonic rock. With very nice gloomy breaks including jazzy leadguitar work by John P. Great song exept for the last part of the song, wich is quite annoying and lasts too long.<BR>-the great debate: sounds a little like tool. Not a typical DT song, but thanks to the great vocals, riffing and melodies it turns out to be a very accomplished track!<BR>-disappear: a relaxed ballad-like song with a melancholic atmosphere. Nice indeed, although not my favorite one on this album<br />Disc 2: I must admit that I didn't really enjoy the overture. It's nice and melodic, but it's a bit to long. After the overture, a briljant prog-song finds it's shape. Sometimes complex and weird, sometimes hard and sometimes very melodic and calm. This 42-minute epic is one of my all time favorite DT songs!<br />Conclusion: these two discs are another milestone in the history of DT. Its not really what I expected of it, but the surprise really was a blow in the face. Great work dudes! DT really managed to incorporate some new elements into their music, wich suit the DT sound well. In my opinion '6DOIT' is even better than scenes from a memory. It's thighter, more agressive and contains better vocalwork and it sounds even better!
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I know people who just can't understand why I hated this film. They just LOVED Moulin Rouge, where I literally cringed through it. I trudged on through the film in the hope that it would get better, but it never did. Sure, the dancing is big and that accounts for my 2 star rating, but I found the overall premise to be stupid. The pop culture inspired lyrics were especially annoying.  As the Editorial above states, \\"Nothing is original...\\" Although that could be said of many films, it has never been more true than with Moulin Rouge.  I apparently had difficulty redigesting the material that Moulin Rouge barfed onto the screen.  \\"Oh but it is so original by reweaving the lyrics and cultural references of the modern age into the context of turn of the century Paris.\\"   Really?  I just found this to be a vacuous waste of film.
0679722556|4.0|Perhaps that is too harsh, for Howard's End truly is a beautiful book.  It is sharp and cunning and written with craft and texture in unearthing the suppressed emotions of its characters.  Gorgeously written, simmering throughout with a subtle and witty prose, sometimes briefly alit with the whoosh of a roaring epiphiny.  The grace of the character study is a worthwhile experience . . .<br />But the story . . . So have ya heard this one before?  Some guy wants to get married but he's already married or he's engaged to another he's fallen out of love with.  The details just don't matter and the constant refrain of the character's endless longing is quiet acceptence complicated by questioning questioning guestioning.  The interactions are trivial and often uninteresting, propelled by the unspoken commentary, subdued by the spoken words amounting mostly to rejections.  This premise is at times intriguing, coaxed into narrative by the awareness of each of the speakers, but then dims out as they try to change the subject, leaving forever buried that one shimmering moment of light.<br />This is the refrain of this novel, for better or for worse--
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is one of the best books I've ever read. It's about two seventeen year old kids, Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan. At first, they hardly know each other and Landon thinks Jamie is weird and crazy. Then, they fall in love. Things go pretty smoothly, but next tragic news is announced. Things change forever for Jamie and Landon. This is a book definately guaranteed to be one of your favorites!
B000002HJD|4.0|In reading the other negative remarks about An American Prayer, I feel compelled to offer up my opinion. I've listened to this album many times over the years and it never fails to put me into a poetic moment, a moment that we get many tastes of with the Doors; although these moments aren't as intense, they're every bit as potent in imagery and concept as any of the poetry he recited/improvised/screamed over the Doors' accompaniment. Many have said that he's reciting in a boring monotone, but to me it's in a soothing tone that invites entry into an at times compelling text. What we have here are mostly poetic fragments; there might be a couple complete pieces and I think a few recurring themes, but what's special about it are the moments that he achieves in those fragments. When reading Rimbaud, one gets the feeling that it's poetry of the moment; not just of that moment but this moment, the moment your'e having right now; it's poetry 'in motion'. Morrison I think lived this ideal with rock music, in a way that Rimbaud would have envied, at least in his youth. Though he's taking a bit of an objective stance in these readings, the words certainly reach that level at some points; and if youv'e read Rimbaud and tried to write some poems and reach for that essence, you'll realize it's a tall order to even capture a little bit of that kind of magic. Most people only listen to this album comming from the pop/rock standpoint, and miss the some of it's subtleties and neat little structures. I wouldn't trade this for my copy of A Season in Hell or Mexico City Blues, nor would I consider it 'serious' poetry, but it's still delightful listening and among my favorite spoken word albums.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I'm curious about one thing.  I would love to know when Gwen Stefani sold her soul to the devil to reach these dizzying heights of popularity, while much higher quality talents and bands languish in the doldrums of near-notoriety and semi-success.  I'd be happier listening to *N SYNC or Britney Spears, because they make no bones about who they are and the type of music they release.  They make pop music, no judgement, no knock, that is their style.<br />Stefani and No Doubt, however, have somehow convinced the world that they are not pop music, not commercially engineered fodder for the masses, but rather a unique concoction of original lyrics and music, simmered to perfection, and featuring Stefani's poor (and seemingly omnipresent) vocals.  Rock Steady is the newest, and perhaps worst, example of this to date.<br />Its first single, \\"Hey Baby\\", is not only nauseating in the consistant jerking style of its music (which is the equivalent of revving your engine then slamming on the brakes) but also in the lyrics themselves (which have all the depth of 2000 Flushes commercial).  I do not write off simplicity.  Some of the best songs ever written are painstakingly simple in their music, lyrics or both.  However, in those cases, you can tell that the artist has vested a piece of him/herself into their work.  You get the sense that No Doubt scribbled the lyrics to this \\"song\\" on a napkin at a pizza parlor.<br />They don't just stop with \\"Hey Baby\\" either.  \\"Hella Good\\" sounds like they went to the worst disco in New York City in 1979, stole the baseline from the worst song they heard and then found some penny-ante Dr. Suess to write the lyrics.  The rest of the songs follow suit.  \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and \\"Start the Fire\\" hold the middle up with further mediocrity and \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\" (perhaps Stefani's psuedo-serious lament) is a fitting end.<br />No Doubt is essentially a group of no talent beach musicians, who have obviously made a pact with the devil to allow for their continued success.  And somehow, Save Ferris still goes largely unknown outside of LA.  (sigh)

0743200799|4.0|Gene Krantz, that rock-solid, buzz-haired epitome of flight controllers has at last put down his stories of the most exciting decade of spaceflight ever. The decade when the USA went from being an also-ran to defining space travel for the world. And Gene Krantz was there from the time they poured the foundations of NASA's Houston complex to the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot upon the Moon.<br />And beyond. The Apollo 13 crisis is perhaps the flight that sums up Gene Krantz. Failure is not an option, he declared and for a week while the world sat on the edges of their seats and three astronauts soared on the edge of a lonely distant death, Gene Krantz and his team planned and struggled and worked to bring them home safely.<br />What a triumph that was when they finally splashed down, and Gene lit up his cigar, wearing his famous vest. There were tears of triumph in his eyes and mine as I relived those days and shared the emotions.<br />Triumph. That is the word that I associate with Gene.<br />His book is his essence distilled. Four-square, no-nonsense, straight up and down. He did his job, he will tell you. No more, no less. Yet if you read between the lines you will see an extraordinary dedication to his job. Even more extraordinary when you consider that dedication was the norm for a whole generation of aerospace engineers. Gene surpassed them all.<br />OK. Enough of the flag-waving. It's that sort of book, full of pride and emotion. It's also chock full of anecdotes, stories, character observations and behind-the scenes glimpses of the man who was Flight.<br />I'd give it five stars, but for the fact that it's a little dry, a little restrained, a little too straight up and down. But I don't think it's in Gene to be relaxed and laid back.<br />Highly recommended, in its own right as a great book on the space race, and as part of the Apollo story.
B00005Q45W|4.0|Having never heard a Leonard Cohen record before this one, I still heard his name & his songs in various places without knowing it was him. Sure, songs like \\"Suzanne\\", \\"Everybody Knows\\", \\"Tower Of Song\\", \\"First We Take Manhattan\\" & many others are on the tips of everyone's tongues thanks to their being made famous by other artists. This is good because Leonard was never much of a singer himself & his albums were basically glorified demos of his work for other artists to hear & choose what they wanted to cover. Well, 9 years after his last masterpiece THE FUTURE, which managed to actually be a good Leonard Cohen record in its own right, he has returned with another set of famous covers in the making, simply titled TEN NEW SONGS.<br />After THE FUTURE was released in 1992, 58-year old Leonard ducked out of sight for the most part, spending several years at Buddhist monastery. Meanwhile, his son Adam had started his own musical career, helping to keep the Cohen name in the public eye. Turns out, Leonard was still working on songs even during his time at the monastery & that he was just working on them tirelessly to near perfection. The aim must have been to make them as less oblique as possible, for the songs on TEN NEW SONGS are among some of the most straightforward he has ever written.<br />The romanticism that has always been a part of Leonard's writing is still very much present on songs like \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\", \\"You Have Loved Enough\\" & \\"Boogie Street\\". With his voice now at near-bass level, Leonard only enhances the romantic nature of the songs with performances even Barry White couldn't have done better on. Some may complain that this is much Sharon Robinson's record as it is Leonard's, but she provides an excellent counterpoint to Leonard's dark aura, so it's only logical that she be featured on the cover along with him.<br />But the graphic sensuality of songs like \\"Light As The Breeze\\" is sacrificed in favor of quiet regret on songs like the first single \\"In My Secret Life\\", \\"That Don't Make It Junk\\", \\"Here It Is\\" & \\"Alexandra Leaving\\". With one of the tenets of Buddhism being the renunciation of material things, these songs show that Leonard was not just a hanger-on looking to embrace a cool religion. He had learned more than a few things during his time at the monastery.<br />TEN NEW SONGS is another entry in the latter-day \\"comeback period\\" that started with 1988's I'M YOUR MAN. While Leonard Cohen was never a hot seller in his own right, his profile had dropped low enough to consider that album every bit of a revitalization in both creativity & commercial success. That album also saw the first instance of those synthesized arrangements that most traditional Cohen fans have decried ever since. While they do make a few appearances in the foreground of TEN NEW SONGS, they don't overpower the songs like they used to, allowing Leonard's ever-deepening voice to take hold.<br />At 67 years old, Leonard Cohen is at the age where he can retire & look back at a career & life full of acheivements. But I think it's great that an aging artist can still find the energy to keep creating at that late period in life. TEN NEW SONGS may have people lamenting that Leonard has done better, but I just think it's quite a good statement coming from someone at this point in his life. He says he'd like to keep writing & recording, but his perfectionism is something he can't help. So if it does take a while for the next album to come, at least we'll have TEN NEW SONGS as proof that maybe Leonard is getting better with time.le \\"In My Secret Life\\", \\"That Don't Make It Junk\\", \\"Here It Is\\" & \\"Alexandra Leaving\\".

0140277447|4.0|This book gives an incredibly horrifying look at the autrocities of war commited in Nanking.  The stories of rape, murder, and overall brutality are enough to give you nightmares.  Iris Chang often uses the metaphor \\"orgy of violence\\" to help readers understand how horrific the acts of the Japanese were.  This book sheds light on the trajedy in the gorriest of details.  These graphic details made it impossible for me to sit down and read the book straight through, I had to read it in spirts so as to not make myself sick.  This is not meant to be taken in a negative manner, however.  Had these details not been included, the book would not have told the truth of the autrocities.  Had Chang downplayed the violence, justice would not have been done.
B000002J1B|5.0|I'm another one of those who place 'Tales From Topographic Oceans' as my favorite Yes work but puts this masterpiece in a very strong-2nd. 'Tales' is their best album, but 'Gates of Delirium' is their best composition ever ('Close to the Edge' a very strong-2nd); and it's on this very album. What a piece of music. Opens with Wakeman's (oops! I mean MORAZ'S) keyboards cascading down into a calm-before-the-storm, pre-war situation entering Anderson's vocals; and the BATTLE itself in which all five soldiers are fully involved to the fitting tune of barbaric clinging/clanging sound-effects. White's drumming is so awesome during this sequence; one hardly misses Bruford. Moraz proves to be the PERFECT Wakeman-replacement in all of this. Steve is simply brilliant like usual; and of course you can't forget one of Yes's 2 main ingredients (Anderson being the other), THE FISH. And then you got 'Sound Chaser' which is Yes at their most craziest; Yes on steroids! Howe REALLY goes all-out on this one. 'Too Be Over' is of course the weakest link on this masterpiece, but is still sweet and relaxing; as if you're 'sailing down the calming streams, drifting endlessly by the bridge.....' Heck, after 'Chaser' has your heart beating at only 400 times a minute, you certainly need that final piece for a 'down-set'; just like you need 'Soon' (the final segment of 'Gates') to calm you down after 'The Battle'. Each side serves the same purpose. Shaped exactly like 'Close to the Edge' (One song taking up Side 1; two songs taking up Side 2), Relayer proves to be what I call Yes's 'last hurrah'; their last 5-star album; their last studio album before their mid-70s-hiatus (from which they never fully recovered; only depreciated with each album that followed). But back to brighter things, Relayer is timeless and definitely a must-get. If much younger music-listeners out there want to disregard this advice and stay tuned to whatever you want to call today's watered-down and watered-down-some-morerock, that's their loss. Their loss. Relayer isn't an album, it's an ADVENTURE! Go get it!

B00005Y7NK|5.0|After missing all Sabbath recordings between &quot;Born Again&quot; and &quot;Eternal Idol&quot;, I returned to the fold with this CD:  The best description for it is thunderous, remorseless and wrenching.  Among its many strengths, three are particularly notable:  1.  A rhythm section that Sabbath never had before and never acquired again, compliments of Mr. Cozy Powell (surprisingly, he was not able to repeat his &quot;Headless Cross&quot; accomplishment in &quot;Tyr&quot;, a consderably weaker record), 2.  Poignant and unabashedly occult/supernatural/christian mythos lyrics that are only matched in quality (if not in subject matter, regardless of appearances to the contrary) in &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Born Again&quot; and &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot;.  3.  Two of the most memorable guitar solos in the band´s repertoire:  the haunting acoustic in &quot;Nightwing&quot; and the same song´s harrowing (desperate?) finale; it´s as if the entity described in the song is about to smash into the players!!<br />My only doubt regarding this album is not knowing on which song Queen´s Brian May played the solo.  But that has nothing to do with the main point:  Don´t waste a minute and buy &quot;Headless Cross&quot;.
B00005JKQX|5.0|John Forbes Nash was a genius who came up with an original mathematical idea (Nash's Equilibrium) that eventually won him a Nobel Prize. In this movie, loosely based on Sylvia Nasar's biography (also called \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\") Russell Crowe plays the troubled mathematician to perfection. Jennifer Connelly turns in a moving performance as Nash's long-suffering wife, Alicia.<br />Nash is a shy and eccentric undergraduate at Princeton when we first meet him. He seems out of step socially, but he is always thinking about new ways to tackle mathematical problems. Although he does come up with an original idea which brings him the fame he has always wanted, he does not get to enjoy the fruits of his efforts for very long. John Forbes Nash is suffering from a severe mental illness and it eventually takes over his life.<br />Crowe and director Ron Howard effectively demonstrate the insidious nature of Nash's illness. Connelly, as Alicia, wants to be a supportive and loving wife, but she eventually realizes that she does not have the power to heal John. However, she doesn't withdraw her love from John, and Nash relies on Alicia as he struggles to regain his sanity.<br />Much has been made about the fact that the movie distorts Nash's life, omitting certain important facts and distorting others. This is a valid criticism, but Howard never claimed that he was making a documentary. He admits freely in a disclaimer that this movie is based on Nash's life; it is not meant to be a literal accounting of everything that Nash did. As a searing character study of a man who was both creative and unwittingly self-destructive, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is unforgettable. Crowe and Connelly both deserve Oscar consideration for their finely nuanced performances.
B000001GF9|5.0|The &quot;Great Mass&quot; on this cd is wonderful, which surprised me as I never really thought of Bernstein as being adept at this sort of work.  What's more, the other two selections are very stirring as well -- particularly the Ave Verum Corpus.  A religious experience.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album is like the past Dream Theater material but pushed to the next level!  It goes from death metal heavy to a sense of deep inner peace.  By far the most complicated (musically) material they've written yet!  I've showed this album to people who've never heard of Dream Theater before and they absolutely love it!  This is a must buy album.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|the torch has been passed, or at least shared, from artists like harry nillson, elton john, randy newman and billy joel - all great pianists who could (an occasionaly still do) write catchy, quirky and touching songs, to rufus wainwright. i've always thought it was hard to catigorize each of these artists (once you get past the obvious lable of &quot;pop&quot;).  they could all write songs which looked at life from an unconventional point of view, wrapped in wonderful melodies that went far beyond &quot;pop&quot; if you just listened closely.  the songs from these four artists during the late 60's and early 70's are among my favorites - they bring back great memories, and can still touch a place in my heart.  i can't think of any &quot;pop&quot; artists from the mid-70's on who could do this, until mr. wainwright's self titled debut album.  and his second outing &quot;poses&quot; is even better than his first.  i'm hoping to have as rich a library of his work many years from now, as i have from nillson, newman, john and joel.

B000001G5A|5.0|I have come to love Bohm's direction of the works of Mozart, and this is no exception.  The first Requiem I owned was Herbert Von Karajan's, and for a long time I loved it very much...  However, as I became older, it sounded increasingly (and overly) muddled to me.  Having read good reviews of it, I went out and purchased Gardiner's version.  This I liked even less...  though it is clear and concise, it feels all wrong for the opposite reasons.  The parts which are naturally busy sound good under Gardiner's direction...  but too often, the whole thing comes off as thin and passionless.  This version, by Bohm, has turned out to be my &quot;just right&quot; bowl of porridge.  Though the tempos are a little slow...  only a little...  the work as a whole will only grow on you.  It is a great experience and a nice balance between Karajan's romanticism and Gardiner's precision.
B00005J9LZ|5.0|Until I came across this album by accident in a friend's music collection in '88 or '89,I was a casual Pet Shop Boys fan.Since then,everybody that I know knows how much of a fan I am!I think this album will always be my favorite,partly because it was my first,but mostly because it's a damn fine collection of songs!<BR>I'd have to say that one of the songs that is not a single is my favorite.&quot;It Couldn't Happen Here&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs ever!This isn't to say that every other song isn't great too though.You pretty much can't go wrong!I absolutely recomend this album to the new fan,old fan or anyone in between!

6301969588|5.0|They say people ran screaming out of the theatres when this movie was first shown back in the 30s.  What they don't tell you is that this is not a horror movie.  This movie is actually intended to show real freaks in real life; the story plot is probably the most unrealistic part of the movie, even though it's standard soap opera and you might even watch this same plot on TV today.<br />What makes this movie interesting isn't the plot, it's the actors, or I should say the people acting out the story.  Because most of them aren't really acting.  The leading villainess is probably an actor, I don't know.  And there are probably a few other real actors here.  But most of the \\"actors\\" are real freaks: the pinheads, the midgets, the siamese twins, the human torso.  The pinheads don't need to act out their confusion and inarticulation; it's real.  The midgets don't have to act out their social isolation.  The siamese twins don't have to act out their physical and mental fusion.  And the human torso doesn't have to practice lighting a cigarette with no arms and no legs to make it look real.<br />Because these \\"actors\\" are real freaks.  And, more importantly, they are real human beings.  Which is why the title \\"Freaks\\" is so ironic; this is a movie about human beings who also happen to be freaks.  <br />Seventy years ago, people ran away screaming because they didn't want to believe it was real, and this movie was banned for a long time.  Today, I'd like to think that people watching this movie have more understanding about the real message in this movie, that a human freak is not just a freak, but a human being also.<br />This is not a horror movie.  And it's not an exploitation movie.  It's in a category all by itself.  It will fascinate you and repell you, and hopefully make you think.
B000056K04|3.0|Dave Matthews Band's latest release, Everyday, is a far cry from the band's usual global, eclectic sound.  With the help of new producer, Glenn Ballard, the DMB has put together a mixture of radio-friendly tunes that are easy to appreciate for their artistry but leave fans unsatisfied.<br />The 12 track album consists of a variation of songs that contrast deeply with the band's previous recordings.  The former themes of living life to the fullest and the pains and pleasures of the world have been passed over for more &quot;radio-friendly&quot; messages of<br />love and happiness.  The most noticeable difference between Everyday and previous recordings is the absence of the long musical solos that are so characteristic of the ensemble.  Violinist Boyd Tinsley and saxophonist LeRoi Moore seem more like guest artists than members of the band.  Also, the lyrics are more straightforward, not filled with the characteristic emotion.  Metaphorically speaking, the songs seem as if processed mechanically and given a coat of varnish, without any workmanship.  The Grateful Dead-type jams have been nixed, and the cryptic lyrics have been exchanged for dull clich&eacute;s.  In particular, the song &quot;Angel&quot; makes fans scream from frustration from the boring boredom.  The music does not challenge the listener, and the lyrics downright boring.  Enjoy the four minute nap. The saving grace of the album is &quot;The Space Between&quot;, which eludes to the lyrical depth of previous albums.<br />Everyday is a good album, filled with catchy tunes and soothing sounds.  Still, it leaves the devoted DMB fan begging for another dose of  Steve Lillywhite, who is the former producer responsible for Under the Table and Dreaming, Crash, and Before These Crowded Streets.)  I recommend you pick up a copy of  Everyday-but make sure you<br />also download the jettisoned tracks known as the &quot;Lillywhite Sessions,&quot; which were originally slated to make up the album.  Their mournful sound makes an excellent foil to Everyday's more joyful tone. Also, check out the band live.  The music takes on a whole new character under the lights of the stadium and before the screaming fans.  Besides, hearing old, classic DMB favorites might fulfill that longing left unfilled by this good but flawed album.kes an excellent foil to Everyday's more joyful tone.

B000002IOW|4.0|I have been a Rush fan since '82, and I can say without a doubt that this is the worst sounding release in their career.  It is a damn shame because it is a superb CD.  Presto crys out to be<BR>re-mastered.  Atlantic needs to get on this because the first 2 releases on their label sound like crap.  Roll the Bones and Presto have no bottom end.

006016848X|1.0|Lots of the negative reviews on this site are by women who feel patronized by Grey's superficial and insulting claptrap.<br />However the book is just as insulting to men. It's core message to men is: you can fix your relationship by not acting like a complete jerk every time you're with your partner, even if it's only once a week, and even if you aren't sincere. <br />For example, Grey thinks you'll be the world's #1 chick-magnet if you show appreciation for the fact that your partner does all the cooking, cleaning, garbage duties etc. Never mind offering to actually contribute to the relationship, just nod when your partner complains about doing all the work. Many of the anecdotes come from John Grey's own experiences. From what the man describes of his own shallow and cavemanlike behaviour, it's no wonder that all the women he knows complain a lot!<br />If my brain ever fell out and I started to take any of Grey's advice, I reckon my now happy and fulfilling marriage would be over in a year (just like John Grey's).<br />How anyone can read this book and rave is beyond me - dreadful beyond words, and dangerous to boot. I'm so glad I read a borrowed copy - if I'd helped John Grey get rich(er) I'd be ashamed. Worth WAY less than one star.

B000002G60|5.0|Having been the first Suzanne Vega album i've ever bought , this seemed to me unimpressive and quite bizzare at first . It is wrong though to try to judge Nine Objects Of Desire without taking the time to study carefully the songs and to distinguish the role it plays as a part of the discreet yet essential  change in Vega's sound .<br />    While on 99.9F the singer made the big step and reinvented herself by mixing her guitar melodies with funk and machinery sounds , on this offering we find her giving jazz a try . The lyrics are once more challenging and sharp . On &quot; Birthday (love made real) &quot; Vega sings about the experience giving birth . &quot; One Thing i know , this pain will go &quot; she declares at the beginning of the song only to start shouting &quot; shake all over like an old sick dog... &quot;  with stange enthusiasm on the refrain . On &quot; Honeymoon Suite &quot; she tells us a hauntig story about visions and ghosts in some hotel-room in France . Her lines in many tracks are full of metaphors and symbolisms . What does her &quot; Favourite Plum &quot; stands for on the last track ? Is it a man ? Or is it the life she wants to have ? It's all these details that make this record so exciting .<br />    Musically the variety is easily being sensed by the listener. Vega choses to follow paths she's never been to before and sings a bossa nova confession of lust in &quot; Caramel &quot; and the smoked , bluesy &quot; Headshots &quot; on which &quot;...a poster of a boy on the wall &quot; whose &quot; two eyes in the sade ,a mouth so sad and small &quot; brings in mind an old lover . <br />   See Nine Objects Of Desire as a piece of potrait's puzzle picturing a woman who behind her calm looks hides so much soul and personallity . That's when you'll understand how great it actually is.
0446608955|2.0|To my disappointment, &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; left me puzzled on how a writer gifted enough to pen &quot;The Notebook&quot; could turn out such a mediocre novel.  This story is slow, predictable and lacks the creativity and story telling worthy of a best selling author. There is little to no character development and plot suspense.  &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; demonstrates a writer producing a novel which can easily adapted to the Silver Screen.  No need to read this book... just wait for the movie.
B000009QPE|5.0|I have one real regret, and that is the mistake of not buying this album sooner. Because you see, this is one of the greatest metal albums ever created. There is no absolutely true way of defining what it is all about, and no review ever really can. You must simply listen and you will understand. Oh, how you will...<br />There are bands that are fast, and then there is Slayer. This is music that only satan himself can comprehend. Lombardo delivers a crushing performance on the drums, playing at a rate of knots that destroys all before him. Both King and Hanneman are simply amazing, pummelling out classic riff after another. And as for our friend Tom, well, he does indeed live next door to the devil.<br />There is not one bad track on this album. We are given the pleasure of hearing 'Angel Of Death', 'Post Mortem' and the annihilistic 'Raining Blood'. There are no weaknesses. People have said that it is one dimensional but I feel that they miss the point entirely. When you go to buy 'Reign In Blood' you must surely know what you are entering into. You are not buying a happy album (although I was smiling because it is so good) and you are not buying into something that is mellow and slow. You are entering the realm of the demented, an album that breaks heads and bursts ear drums. Demonic is still not there. <br />This album is also beautifully seamless. The prime example of this is the end of 'Post-mortem' and the start of 'Raining Blood'. It is difficult to tell where the start actually is. This lends the album the quality of being one continuous, bludgeoning and speed fueled adrenaline rush. If you were to put the album on repeat you would not be troubled to discover that you may have listened to it a couple of times over without realising. It flashes by in a blaze of magnificants that simply astounds.<br />Suffice to say that this is a classic through and through. Even now, compared with over - hyped 'popular' material this work is superb. Indeed, it makes the 'nu-metal' sound just as it is, vastly inferior. I have never heard anything like this, never will. It is beyond comparison. You must own this. You will forever be in torment if you don't!

B00005R2BG|4.0|So THIS is what happens when screenwriters are high! This movie, though excellent, has a definite halluciogenic feel to it, complete with swirling colors and dancing fairies, not to mention the fact that the herione lives in a giant elephant!<BR>Be alert and clear headed when you watch this movie, or you will lose the plot in the flashing lights and sometimes surreal musical numbers. Bare bones plot summary: The hero is a naive young writer who falls in love with a beautiful performer and courtesan, and he must struggle to win her love and thwart the plans of the duke, who plans to marry her. Sound like a simple plot, but it is carried out in a spectacular fashion, thick with both comical and tender moments, as well as the requisite tearjerker scenes. Oh, did I mention the music? Almost anyone will recognise at least one of the songs in this movie, which are borrowed from such artists as Gilbert and Sullivan, Rodgers and Hammerstein, classic Broadway, The Beatles, and even Madonna! Who knew that Nicole or Ewan could sing like that? I sure didn't! Whether you love it or hate it, I doubt that you have ever seen anything quite like Moulin Rouge!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I can't remember the last time I was swept away by a movie like I was with this one.  Totally engrossing, beautifully acted and staged--this is one of my all-time favorites.
B00005JKES|4.0|I loved this series in college, and now have the 1st season on DVD.  Any Twin Peaks or David Lynch fan should love this.  My only criticism is that the flesh tones of most characters blend seamlessly with the wood paneling in the interior shots (sherrif's office, the lumber mill, the hotel, etc.).  This doesn't happen any other time (TV, VHS, DVD), and I have a nice TV set as well.  I don't think I want to adjust it just for this series, but this still rules.  Sound and everthing else is A-OK.
B00005OCMR|4.0|I actually don't have many fond memories of \\"Tron\\". I saw the film as a child (on *shudder* VHS), and wasn't impressed with the overall result. But my friends and I constantly played Deadly Discs with Frisbees. Ever been hit in the shin with one of those?  I picked this DVD up mainly because it was loaded with bonus features and had a low price. Surprise! The film is really cool. I can honestly say this is the best that \\"Tron\\" has ever looked or sounded, and the 88 minute (!) documentary is highly informative and entertaining. I would recommend this DVD to just about anyone. (Well, maybe not kids. My daughter was REALLY bored.)
B00005RZV4|3.0|This album is in my mind severly hampered by its nonsensical omissions.  I was initially disappointed to learn that it would not be a double disc set (which could accomidate the full 100 minute concert), but I understand that that would probably drive down sales, so the &quot;suits&quot; at Nothing wouldn't allow it.  As it is,t he album clocks in at 74 minutes, meaning that an additional 6 minutes of audio could've been included.  Why then are &quot;Pinion&quot; and &quot;La Mer&quot; excluded?  Pinion was crucial to the opening of the Fragility concerts.  As it is, the album starts off with the opening drums of &quot;Terrible Lie,&quot; and you feel a bit like you walked into the concert late.  Now, &quot;La Mer&quot; was one of the most beautiful moments of the Fragility set, and complements &quot;the Great Below.&quot;  I could understand the omission of these tracks had there been a problem with the running time, but both would've easily fit within the available 6 minutes.  I guess the &quot;suits&quot; figured that cutting the running lenght would somehow improve sales.  As with Underworld and Radiohead, once again, the ideal live album has been eluded.<br />Outside of those problems, the album is really quite fantastic.  It features the best mixing I've ever heard on a live album, and it is a true treat to hear Reznor's material performed by a live band, without all the meticulous overdubs, and find it to be equally beautiful/viceral.
B00003CXE7|5.0|i loved this movie.  i wasn't sure how much i'd like it because i'm not much into violence and the roman era, but i was definitely surpised.<br />russel crowe is wonderful, and so is joaquin phoenix.<br />i definitely recommend this movie to everyone, even if you're not - like me - a fan of action movies or period pieces.
B00005U1YO|3.0|My feelings regarding this album are complex and contradictory.  Just about every track on the album is good, and 80% of 'em are really quite fantastic.  However, they refuse to gel into a cohesive album.<br />The three prior Chemical Brothers albums were epic works.  Each plays like an opus, the tracks flowing strongly, carrying the listener through a near psychedelic experience.  Come With Us plays like a b-sides collection, without any perceived arc or continuity.  Herein the strength of the individual tracks cannot save the album.<br />Each prior Chemical Brothers album had an agenda: EPD established the &quot;big beat&quot; genre; DYOH perfected it and functioned as an exercise in pure sonic excess; with Surrender the Chems' production tightened, and they took on a more sophisticated, emotional material, contrasting with the pure viceral thrill of their earlier works.  Come With Us fails to breach any new ground, and as a whole, it seems to have no agenda.  There's no innovation in their production, and nothing they try here is at all ambitious compared to their earlier works.  It's old hat for the Chemical Brothers.  It's almost as if Tom'n'Ed put the album out due to contractual obligations.<br />That said, there is some interesting material on this album.  &quot;Afrika&quot; is a bonafide stormer, and sounds wonderful out on the dance floor.  &quot;Star Guitar&quot; may well be one of their best tracks, and features some fantastic production, crafting beautiful harmonies out of filtered Moroder-esque space disco.  I love the pairing of spanish guitar and electro breaks in Hoops, which I imagine will sound wonderful live.  &quot;The Test&quot; is the most successful Chemical Brothers collaboration to date, fully incorporating Richard Ashcroft's vocals into the music and thematics (unlike Bernard Sumner in &quot;Out of Control&quot;).  Closing the album, &quot;the Test&quot; is the closest the Chems have ever come to the spiritual high-water mark they set withTPPR.  These tracks make the album worth the effort, but within the context of the Chems' career, this is undoubtedly their weakest work to date.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|i was merely intrigued when i saw this movie at our local movie-renting place about two months ago, so my dad rented it for me.<br />i thought it would be a pleasant romp thought nineteenth-century montmartre.  boy was i wrong!<br />it is the delicious, over-the-top, all-singing, all-dancing story of christian and satine and their love.  a brash, electrifying journey through the moulin rouge, a high-end whorehouse where the rich would come to play.<br />ewan mcgregor is, in a word: amazing.  his voice, his accent, his acting ability.  he is the ultimate embodiment of christian.<br />and what can i say about nicole kidman that hasn't been said before?  she has a beautiful voice, and was the perfect casting choice as satine.<br />i cannot stop watching this movie.  i only wish i had seen it in the theatres!  the DVD more than makes up for that, however.  a lush two-disc set, it boasts an impressive &quot;behind the red curtain&quot; feature that informs the viewer how a certain scene was made as well as everything from interviews with cast members to the music video for the ever-popular &quot;lady marmalade&quot; (which, incidentally, was, in my opinion, the only drawback to the film).<br />there are cut scenes, director commentary, stories on how &quot;moulin rouge&quot; came to be, etc, etc...<br />baz luhrmann is a genius for having put this film together and for not caring about the critiscm (totally unwarranted, if i may say so) it received, and will probably continue to receive.<br />if you enjoy your more run-of-the-mill musicals, i doubt this film will interest you.  however, if you have an open mind and are willing to experience something new, this film is for you.<br />if i could give it ten stars, i would! =)
B00005UEAR|5.0|Being a fan of DT since WDaDU, I know what to expect from them: hard guitars, thumping bass and drums, trilling keys and LaBrie's perfect voice. M2-SFAM was a pleasant surprise (still one of my all-time favorites) but this goes beyond any expectation I would've even dreamed of. Who would've thought that they could sound like Radiohead? Misunderstood and Disappear could have easily wound up on OK Computer, and that is a very high compliment. They are also my two favorites on the CD, not to say that the rest of the CD is nothing to cry over. Glass Prison rocks from the get-go--play the end of SFAM and connect it to the beginning of Glass Prison: it melds into one song! So cool! The second CD is a true masterpiece, from the Emersonian Overture to the heart-wrenching child's yawn in Goodnight Kiss to the Finale. Probably my only gripe would be The Great Debate: it sounds out of place. Worthy subject, but not something I'd sing about. Everyone's on their mark, and it would be wrong to single out anyone when they're all so good. I, for one, cannot wait until I see them next month.
B000003S09|5.0|I recently heard this album (on the original Atlantic vinyl, no less) for the first time in quite a while. It reminded me what a truly unique recording this is. Progressive rock peaked at it's outset; it would never be this unsettling, well-played, or accessible again. It also caused me to wonder how the recording industry ever allowed itself to be seduced by the convenience of digital...
B00000I07P|5.0|Slippery When Wet is the best. All the tracks are good.<BR>My favorite is Raise Your Hands. It's makes you feel<BR>good inside. Just to think I can sing like Jon, is crazy<BR>I know, but I love it. Let It Rock.. ROCKS... <BR>If you have New Jersey which is also very good, then buy<BR>Slippery. You won't be dissapointed.

B0000013GT|5.0|I wanted to buy this album for a long time and I finally did and it rocked my planet.  If you like Outkast and don't have this album, you must have it.  Even if the rest of the album were marginal, songs 2, 3 and 4 are worth the price alone.  Outkast is one of the best groups around.  GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!
B00003CXXP|4.0|I agree that this is one of Spielberg and Kubrick's more original and thought provoking films.  Both directors are genius when it comes to etching memorable one-of-a-kind characters who represent the audience's psyches at one and the same time.  The robotic boy here is chillingly played by Osment, who is brilliant in a role far more complex and varied than his Oscar nominated turn in \\"The Sixth Sense.\\"  In Haley Joel, the director finds his muse, and allows the film's bizarre triangle narrative take its course.  We see the film in part through the child's eye, one of Speilberg's specialities, and like \\"Empire of the Sun\\" (one of the director's true masterpieces) we are enveloped in his cravings.  Osment makes the character even more human than his truly human counterpart, and his scenes with his mother are gripping.  They can haunt even the hardest soul among us but only because Osment is at the top of his game here.  Any other young actor might have given into the temptation to camp this part up, but like Christian Bale in \\"Empire\\" Osment uses his eerie man-child gaze and facial affectations to convey all the tenderness and unmitigated desire that makes a child's energy so special.  There are harrowing moments in AI where I had to look away (most likely Kubrick's main plot) but these too add to the plot and move the story along.  Perhaps even more chilling than Osment's singular standout performance is the film's final vision, of an underwater New York City, post-September 11th, but also intact, swallowed by an ocean.  The whole film is a testament to the power of the medium - it rises up and grabs us, forces us to contemplate real recurring themes (here - lost innocence, freedom, and the obvious mother-son dynamic) and never lets go.  To be sure, at times, the movie plods and pokes along - a minstrel show of horrors that are painful to witness but essential to the vision.  Give AI a rent at least and let yourself go with it....it will NOT relax you, but instead transport you somewhere far far away.  See it for Osment, who deserves Oscar notice, but is unlikely to get it (a shame, for he's stunning here!)
B00005UV96|3.0|wow.  putting behind their experimental side of 'surrender', tom and ed return with a powerhouse of a release.  three tracks are already hits with the various crowds out there: it began in afrika, galaxy bounce, and star guitar.  the rest of the tracks are a flurry of genres, from electrofunk to some idm-like beats to some dub/ambient.  with guest appearances from beth orton and richard ashcroft, both tracks of which were solid, the album rounds out nicely.  regretably, the tease of the idea of mixing all the song together between it began in afrika and galaxy bounce leave me with a wish to have seen them do it.  and while it is a solid album, it is nothing extraordinarily new from the chems, just more of what one would expect.  they also lose points for allowing astralwerks to release a 'limited edition' version of the cd.
6304712936|5.0|Tom Hulce's Mozart is about as grand as any comedic-camp-drama performance as any you'll ever see on screen.  In \\"Amadeus\\" he shatters all preconceptions of his talents as an actor, deserving credit for fully realizing a complex, satisfying character with pure sincerity and wham-packed emotion.  He has guts that far outweigh Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham (the villainous Salieri who is contemptuous sarcastic, and jealous of the genius whose life is splayed before him.)  Hulce taunts, whoops and wallops the part out of the ballpark, with a childish relish that makes the audience long for the days when men wore white wigs and women corsets.  <br />The music is exquisite, needless to say, and Milos Forman once again proves his mettle as a fierce director - even \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" (Forman's first Oscar film) seems novice-like after you witness the depth and beauty of \\"Amadeus.\\"  The film easily ranks as one of the best biographical portraits ever imagined from Hollywood, and on your DVD player, you'll experience SOUND unlike anything you ever imagined was possible.  Turn it up and let Hulce steal you away!  This is the perfect film for anyone who doesn't REALLY enjoy classical music, because here, the music is transforming and you become caught up in its lyrical melodies as much as in the story.  A wonderful film with a magnificent performance by Tom Hulce!
B00001ZWTS|5.0|I cannot believe how badly this film has been received. Its hype, stars and style suggest a blockbuster critical and commercial success in the mould of Will Smith's Men In Black, whereas many viewers register disappointment. Ultimately it's up to you whether you like this film, and I am pleased to say that I did. The action never lets up, the film is crammed with interesting set pieces and gadgets and four very good performances, courtesy of Kevin Kline, Will Smith, Keneth Branagh and Salma Hayek. The story is about two U.S.Marshalls with very different styles (and different colours) thrown together on the orders of the president in the days of the Wild Wild West. The interaction between the two men is witty and clever, whilst also believable. Kline dressed up as a woman has to be seen to be believed! The music is terrific, especially Smith's re-working of Stevie Wonder's Out The Back Door as the title theme.<br />The DVD is value for money offering a good selection of behind the scenes stuff and mini-documentaries.
6305736650|5.0|In a word - magnificent.  A towering accomplishment rarely visualized before or since, and easily one of the best films of all time.  There are insufficent adjectives to apply to Bogart in the role of Rick, and even fewer ways to describe the incandescent, glowing Ingrid Bergman, in what is perhaps her signature performance.  A centerpiece to any DVD collection, &quot;Casablanca&quot; still moves its audience to tears and anger, but ultimately, its a love story of unparalleled heart.  A masterpiece.
6303394000|2.0|In his 1970 masterpiece, 'Cabaret', Bob Fosse evoked in his atmosphere, his style and his attitude the works of playwright Bertolt Brecht (with his one-time musical partner Kurt Weill) to recreate the pre-Nazi world of Weimar Germany.  This influence was superficial - unlike Brechtian drama, character, location and narrative progression in 'Cabaret' remained coherent and consistent, the illusion of a fictional world complete (the musical's most Brechtian role, the MC, was significantly reduced in the film).<br />In 'All That Jazz', Fosse's autobiographical mea culpa, he tries to give his work a Brechtian form.  The narrative arc - Roy Schneider, a hugely successful Broadway producer and film director, and Jessica Lange, part-Bride of Death, part-confessor angel, sit in a darkened, ethereal dressing room among the debris of his life, which they look back on: the failed marriages, the relationship with his daughter; the compulsive womanising; the drugs; the insane working methods, their supposely way-out genius not quite outweighing the humiliating of inferiors, the dependence on conservative financial backers or the potty moments of 'inspiration' (including a risible set-piece choreographing an orgy) - is broken down into looping repetitive fragments, supposedly representing the mental deterioration of the main character.  As Brecht decreed, the viewer is consistently alienated from what s/he sees on screen, asked to acknowledge the mechanical process that goes into making films that mainstream films try to hide.  Fantasies, dreams, flashbacks, hallucinations and memories constitute the film's reality, which never leaves its main character's head.  Rapid editing; garish mise-en-scene; loud, cluttered, frenetic compositions; disorienting camera angles; jazz-like structural repetitions and attempts at so-called 'improvisation'.  <br />But where Brecht wanted the spectator to think and become politically active, Fosse enervates and harangues.  This wouldn't matter if the musical numbers were spectacular, but with the exception of the hospital hallucination sequence recalling the pastiche Busby Berkeley/Ziegfeld Follies aesthetic he pioneered, these are ruined in the tricksy filming, or by their downbeat, shabby, 'modern' treatment.  <br />There is nothing wrong a director taking himself as a subject - filmmakers as important as Welles, Bergman and Godard created new possibilities for the cinema by doing so.  But their introspection never destroyed the credibility or integrity of their filmic worlds - Charles Foster Kane or Hank Quinlan may reveal aspects of Welles, but these are independent, developed characters interacting with other characters, a narrative and an environment.  There is no other reality in 'Jazz' than that created by Schneider - every character, scene and place exists solely to comment on or reveal his neuroses.  Even a film as solipsistic as 'Vertigo' allowed the viewer space away from the central consciousness.  Here, as in the Fellini films that were clearly Fosse's inspiration, we suffocate in an airless carnival of ego.
B00001U0DP|5.0|If you're like me, and sometimes still reeling from the devastation of September 11th, you'd do well to resvist this poignant tale of true undying love and unconditional peace of mind.  Begnini's masterpiece is surely one of the finest films in any language to have the Holocaust as a backdrop, and here, as real and intense as that era exists onscreen, it takes a back seat (if thats even possible) to the extrovert genius of Roberto Benigni, who is part Buster Keaton, part Willy WOnka and ALL John Wayne.  His heroism in the most hostile of human tragedies makes this a film about war's human toll - for in his characterization, Benigni is our heart and soul, the conscience of the world, for he balances humor with terror and shows us that sometimes, laughter is the ONLY medicine.  A deserved classic to be enjoyed for generations of families around the world, \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is a fable for our times, and a source of pure imagination and inspiration.
B00005N83O|4.0|Now I'm gonna tell you straight out. I do NOT own this YET. I heard it at a friends house and Now I'm gonna go buy it.

6305161879|5.0|I still cackle every time I watch &quot;Wanda&quot; with its screwball story, its zany characters and its funny one-liners that get me every time.  The ensemble cast is tremendous, with Kevin Kline in his all time film role (and OScar winner) as Otto, while Jamie Lee Curtis proves her own comedic mettle in her scene-chewing moments with Cleese and Palin.  The dialogue is simply hysterical, and still likeable, which I think is truly rare in a film.  Without all that much gimmickry, the cast and plot work without a hitch (or rather, with so many hitches, your head'll be swimming with possibilities!)  But certain scenes are standouts - the dropping pianos, the language fetishes, and especially the interplay between Kline and Palin, who lash out at each other in unpredictable, pure comedy heaven moments!  You're guaranteed to love this &quot;Wanda-r&quot; - she's something else!
B000005JH5|5.0|If you're reading this review, I assume you fall into one of three categories:<br />1)  You already own most of Kate Bush's CDs and are just checking out what others think;<br />2)  You've purchased some of her \\"newer\\" stuff like Hounds of Love and are thinking about back-filling your Kate collection;<br />3)  Somehow you've drifted through the Universe without discovering Kate Bush and realize you need to correct this oversight quickly and quietly.<br />So, in response to 1), let me say:  This is an uneven CD, but the good parts are so good, the disk rates five stars.  You have romantic classics like \\"The Man with the Child in his Eyes\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and pure sophmoric feminine romanticism in \\"Feel It\\" and \\"Oh to be in Love\\" which still has the power to touch us all through Kate's direct, emotive, and clearly heart-felt delivery.  I love her sense of Brit humor, which comes across all too knowingly in \\"Them Heavy People\\".<br /><br />In response to 2):  This isn't hard rock with a cutting edge like Hounds of Love and doesn't have the alternative bent of The Dreaming either.  When she tries to inject harder rock, like in \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" it sounds like over-reaching.  Most of the tracks on this CD fall into the melodic / romantic category, which is Kate's sweet spot.<br />In Conclusion:  If you like the romantic Kate Bush, you should own this CD.  If you like the hard rocking Kate, you probably won't like this CD.  If you're just discovering Kate, you should also own this CD because it's a good introduction to some of her best efforts...and you'll better appreciate her later works.
0800141660|4.0|Emma Thompson won her secnd Oscar for her adaptation of Jane Austen.  As filmed by the one-and-only Ang Lee, the result is pure bliss, with first rate performances from Thompson herself and Kate Winslet, both Oscar nominees for acting.  Lee infuses every scene with high costume comedy-drama, so that even the simplest overtures become symbolic of somthing far greater, more refined and visually grand than anythnig Hollywood has released in nearly a decade.  Think &quot;A Room With A View&quot; with high-jinks and you'll get the picture.  A Romantic Classic.
0375501851|1.0|Tedious at best! Just as a character begins to develop,<BR>the author is off on another track.

6304806426|4.0|Easily one of those films that most women will adore and most men are advised to avoid, \\"The English Patient\\" is also much more.  Glowing cinematography, sweeping vistas and a romance that resonates with both innocence and guilt at one and the same time, it's easy to see why critics adored it too, while many in the audience found it plodding and dull.  SOme moments are held for what seems forever, by a camera that's in love with its own grandeur (and rightly so in my opinion.)  AT times, the dialogue is muffled or highly British, so I've found myself hearing questions like \\"what'd he say?\\" thrown about in the dark.  If you give it a chance and allow it to sink in, like the sand that's all around and ever-present on screen, \\"The English Patient\\" does stand as a work of wonder.  Oscar winner for Best Picture and Director, it's most deserved award recipient and singular star-making surprise is Juliet Binoche in an almost thankless role as the Nurse who tends to a dying prisoner, whose face is a harrowing reminder of the war raging around them, and the landmines that exist in his story.  There, we encounter evil Nazis and a (married) woman of exquisite beauty who becomes his muse and at once, his lover.  The chilling love triangles that ensue, not to mention the back and forth thru time editing of the film's construct, can create havoc for any viewer.  But, I encourage you to sit once through it, perfectly quiet, and just observe the grace and majesty it evokes through sound, visuals and spoken word.  Listen to th elover's stories, and then witness Binoche's own transformation and power onscreen, and you will be hooked!  A STAR IS BORN indeed....and not Minghella, but the inspired selection of Juliette Binoche in a landmark performance sure to rank among her greatest, when her fine career is tallied up.
B00005NVDF|5.0|I'm currently at 516-674-7077 and will be going to 516-759-8010. <br />And so it goes as one of the funniest sub plots in another of Woody's \\"trying to score\\" themed films, (come to think of it, aren't they all...)this time with the big B, (Humphry Bogart) providing the guidence.<br />This is a really fine, fine film, and one scene in his apartment when meeting his blind date can almost hurt......<br />Everyone knows that Woody Allen is one of the best and most original American Film directors of our generation, and will be one of those guys like Bob \\"trust in America\\" Hope who is so big, they have to be given a special Academy Award because the folks around him just can't deal with his true stature.....<br />Fortunately for us, we have his work, and laughter will always be the best medicine, and the best compliment to his brilliance<br />*Note, there was a scene in the theatical release of one of his films with Woody watching the Zapruder Film and stating that JFK was clearly shot from the front...there ain't many people of his depth to do that.  He will always have my respect for that single action. (Annie Hall)
B00003CXA4|3.0|&quot;Gandhi&quot; stands as Richard Attenborough's signature film, a sweeping epic biography of the spiritual giant among men who was Mohatma Gandhi.  The film rates 5 stars for all of its cinematic accomplishments, from its stunning cinematography to its colorful palette of costumes, set design and lighting.  The film is Oscar worthy, especially Ben Kinglsey's starling transformation as the peace loving hero.  <br />And yet, unlike other testimonials to our other heros and idols, spiritual or otherwise, the film is overly long - at least 30 minutes too long - and will challenge the most committed viewer unless they're trapped in a theater or theater class!  Some sequences feel they go on forever, and unnecessarily at that, as time and space interweave with the tale of the Man himself, his humanity, humility, and far-from-humble beginnings.  It's a towering film to be sure, but in a soft, unmagnetic way that never shows it's pure unadulterated SOUL.  Instead of looking INTO the leader's heart, &quot;Gandhi&quot; looks AT it;  instead of bringing us closer to his ultimate message and tactical wisdom, he becomes a caricature a victim of his time and place.  Though Kingsley effectively combats the script to ensure his character's humanity comes through, it's a tiresome battle, and I still find the film too dull and flat to recommend as a Must Own.  To be sure, if you ARE in the mood for a Global Peace Epic - this is what the doctor ordered.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I read some of the terrible reviews of this film and frankly cannot fathom them.  This movie was one of the most moving, entertaining, gloriously filmed spectacles that I have ever seen.  I own over 150 movies on DVD and this is the only one that has ever motivated me to write a recommendation.  I urge everyone to at least give it a try.
6302753295|5.0|I watched the original once as a boy and loved every minute of it.  Then for some reason the movie just simply disappeared.  When the tape came out, I snatched it up.  John Wayne shows he can not only be the rough and tough cowboy, but a real comedian also.  The supporting cast, Maureen O' Hara, is a perfect opposite of the Duke and fills the screen with fire and sparks that only O' Hara and Wayne can produce.  The only down side is the DVD edition.  Extremely poor quality and cropped so badly that you miss very important parts of some scenes that are essential to the story line.  I would say use the digitally mastered version to make a DVD and put it in letter box so you don't miss one single exciting moment of this unique treasure.

B00005N53P|5.0|The Strokes bleed attitude man, sporting painfully exotic names like Fab, Nikolai and, er, Albert (but his surname IS Hammond, which is pretty exotic, right?), they come with something of a reputation, and the tag of next big thing (over in England anyway, where things like this quite often catch on a bit quicker...). Is This It does not disappoint baby. It is a thrillingly cooool debut, a throwback but also a throw forward. They are obviously influenced by Lou Reed et al, and no review would be complete with that obligatory namecheck, but The Strokes take the NY 70s rock n roll blueprint and mess with it somewhat, injecting their own style and substance and in the process creating the best rock album in years. This version isn't the Import version here either, it's the shop-bought original, resplendent with bare arse artwork and New York City Cops. Anyway, the songs are fantastic, and the only two I'm going to mention are Hard to Explain, because it manages to claim title of best song on an album which is crammed with great songs, and Take it or Leave it, which is the worst on the album, but still pretty good. This should give you an idea of how good the record is - there are simply no bad songs on it. That's the mark of a great album in my book.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is one of the best contemporary rock releases of the last few decades, period.  The songs are heartfelt and touching, and the melodies memorable.  Musically and lyrically, U2 has hit a sweet spot that has resonated with music listeners everywhere.  This one IS a true masterpiece, and U2 is one of the best rock bands ever!
B00005OCMR|5.0|Remember 20 years ago when you watched this film and wanted an energy disc of your own and one of those killer lightcycles? Now you can relive the fun and adventure, and cringe at the 80's fashions. This film was groundbreaking in its use of CGI, and the menus are full of CGI graphics too. They make you feel like you are back in the movie. The bonus documentaries are interesting and informative. They give you a look back to the excitement that all of those involved felt at the time of production, as well as everyone's recollections of the shoot from a modern perspective. the 90 minute documentary has some fascinating rememberances of a time when Tron was just being conceived, and it's growing pains. <br />See, I knew that the scenes were all shot in black and white, what I didn't know was that all of the backgrounds were solid black. I knew where to spot Pac-Man, did you? I thought this was a great transfer, makes me hope that someday Disney will do the same thing with The Black hole.<br />I loved the DVD menus with their Tron Universe animations running around and driving through the background. I know any twentysomething who grew up with this film will feel the same. unless you are disappointed because you bought the other version.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Saddly, this soundtrack couldn't fit all the musicals from the movie in a disc.  I think buying the DVD might be a little better, can't wait for it to come out.  <br />My favorites got to be &quot;Come what may&quot; and &quot;Elephant Love Medley.&quot;  There is a good collection of songs.  I do not understand why there are two songs of &quot;Nature Boy.&quot;  I think one of them should be replaced.  Just my 2 cents.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is one of those albums that will be influencing music for many years.  I've had it since it came out and it hasn't lost any magic.  Keep an open mind about it, give it some time to sink in; it will pay off.
059035342X|4.0|The plot of the book is,Harry is a wizard and his mother and father die when he is a baby. So he has to go live with \\"muggles\\" or people that aren't witches or wizards. When he turns eleven he gets a lot of letters from the best school of witchcarft and wizardy, which his mother and father also went to. So he goes to the school, the name is Hogwarts, and a bunch strange things happen to him and his friends(Ron and Hermione). So they  decide to try and find out what's going on around the school. And they do. It has to do with the Sorcerer's Stone(hints the name)and the person who killed Harry's parents(Lord Voldermort) That's all I'm going to tell you becuase i don't want to ruin it for you.<br />  My opinion of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is I thought is was wonderful, but I saw the movie before i I read the book. It was hard getting into the first few chapters. When  <BR>I did I could not put the book down. My parents had to take the book away to get me to go to sleep.<br />  The main antagonist main are Draco Malfoy, Profesor Snape, Lord Voldermort, Profesor Quirrell, and the DRusleys. The main protagonist are of course Harry Potter, Hermoine Ganger, Ron Weasley, Profesor Dumbledore,and Hargrid.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I like Kid A better, but Amnesiac is a dang good album.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel Revolving Doors and Morning Bell/amnesiac are throw away tracks.  They should have been on b-sides if anything.
1573222038|5.0|I looked forward eagerly to the publication of \\"Fingersmith,\\" and Waters didn't let me down. I don't usually read historical fiction, because it so often is heavy-handed and trite. But Waters captures the Victorian tone & sensibility so skillfully, while keeping her writing fresh, surprising, and original. Her novels contain familiar elements of Victorian fiction--teeming London slums, forbidding country manors, mysterious young women prone to fainting--while also giving voice to realms of female experience that Dickens never dreamed of. The plot was convoluted at times, but I still couldn't put the book down. Like Waters' previous books, Fingersmith has a deep-rooted feminist sensibility and lesbian subtext (well--not that \\"sub,\\" actually!). But, unlike so much lesbian fiction, the characters have real depth and subtlety; they do not think, speak, or behave anachronistically; and the emotions are complex. Waters has a real appreciation of the way class, power, and gender dynamics get caught up in sexual desire, even desire between women. Amazingly, she also tells a great story.
0743216458|5.0|One word: Intense. That sums up my feelings about this tremendous account of an extraordinary bunch of guys who made up company E of the 506th PIR an attachment of the legendary 101st Airborne Division (the Screaming Eagles). Better known as &quot;Easy Company&quot;, I was instantly drawn into their story from the first PREVIEW of the excellent Band of Brothers series that aired on HBO this past fall. I actually wish there were more than 10 episodes to Band of Brothers, I found it that well written and that compelling. To my surprise I later learned that one of the men of Easy company, Bill Guarnere, was a friend of my grandfather. I vaguely remembered my grandfather refer to Bill through the years - recalling the crazy stuff they did together &quot;in those days&quot;, but it wasn't until Band of Brothers that I realized how significant Mr. Guarnere's experiences had been. It was a very interesting discovery.<br />This book is a perfect read for anyone even remotely interested in history. Many of the tales recounted in the book were told by the men who lived them - through interviews, diaries they wrote and other documentation - all painstakingly researched by the author and brilliantly written in an easy to follow format.<br />Put it this way - the first day I began reading this book I read 106 pages in one sitting. That's a personal &quot;record&quot; for me, for the longest time I ever spent reading a book in a single sitting.<br />And I read *ALOT*.<br />Chances are slim to none that any of the surviving members of Easy Company will see this review but if they do....I salute you gentlemen...thanks.<br />-One Proud American
B00003CXXR|3.0|Jurassic Park was entertaining, but The Lost World (which was the 2nd film) was a stinker. Jurassic Park III, I feel, is the best of the trio, presenting itself in the traditional formula of classic Hollywood films. The first two movies featured people invested with exotic professions in one sense or another. Granted that's usual even in classic Hollywood. This version, however, pits everyday people (basically the family involved) with the ferocious nature of the island. It increases the tension. The addition of William H. Macy, one of our most enjoyable contemporary actors, adds significantly to the mix. Would anyone have survived if the situation had been real? Probably not. JPIII is just good pulp action melodrama. Shorter than its predecessors (at c.90 mins.), the screenplay is lean and to the point. The boat that they find and use to travel down river reminds me of something out of a Joseph Conrad story. I highly recommend this underrated film for pure fun and thrills.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Vin Diesel stars as Richard B. Riddick, a potentially amoral and dangerous criminal being transported through space to prison.  When the spacecraft crashes on an isolated planet, only a few survive, including Claudia Black (Farscape), Cole Hauser, and Radha Mitchell.  During the day, the planet is a barren dessert, and the survivors worry that they will die of thirst; as night falls, they find that they are prey to a terrifying foe.  The survivors find themselves relying on Riddick, despite their hesitation.<br />Pitch Black is a solid sci-fi thriller, despite its relatively low budget (23 million).  The director, David Twohy (writer of \\"The Fugitive\\"), manages to maintain a genuinely creepy atmosphere throughout the movie and keeps the movie unpredictable.  Ultimately, it's the type of well-crafted B-movie that is rarely made today, and it helped make Vin Diesel a star.  Pitch Black is likely to become a cult classic, helped immeasurably by the forthcoming planned sequel \\"The Chronicles of Riddick.\\"<br />Extras: The DVD features an excellent director commentary track, which sustains a nice balance between technical description of special effects and more general aspects of how the movie was created.
6305907145|4.0|Taken without the book in consideration, this movie is quite good. Fanny in this version is a loveable character who you can feel for. The wit and undertones in this movie make it a delightful movie that can be watched over and over and still not completely gotten. However, it does stray from the book quite a bit. If you are looking for a strict version of the book, such as the P&P miniseries, this is not it. The movie does not even do what Emma and S&S do, not only does it skip scenes but it invents new plots, changes characters,and so on. Whether the movie is better for it, I cannot say. I do think though that Austen would not have had a problem with the movie. I feel that it is still in true Austen style.
0671582364|4.0|I'm not a big Stephen King fan and have read relatively few of his novels.  However, I was quite entertained and pleased with the audiobook version of &quot;On Writing,&quot; which is read by King himself.  King has obviously mastered the craft of writing solid novels that entertain many people, although by his own admission he is not the kind of author that critics love.  As such, his writing advice is workmanlike but also incredibly useful.  King intersperses his advice with illustrative vignettes from his childhood and early days as a writer.  You can really see how his interest and talent in writing developed.  Although he gives much useful basic advice about writing (e.g., avoid adverbs), perhaps the most illuminating was his description of what it takes to be a good writer ? lots of reading and lots of practice.  It's easy to see how his famous work ethic has lead to his immense productivity and success.  King breaks down the writing process in a way that inspired me to write more after listening to the audiobook.  Highly recommended.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Early on in this movie about a man stuck living the same day over and over we hear him complain about the monotony of his situation to a barfly who says it sounds like his life.<br />This movie is about finding out what to do when you're stuck in a rut.  Watch it for the right-on-target humor of the situation, or for the heartfelt romance, or even for the way the filmmaking process is reflected in the mind-numbing repetitions in his life (moviemaking is about multiple takes, right?).<br />In the end the movie is a terrific story of a man who finds his reasons to keep going on and discovering to his amazement that the rest of his life falls into place.  Somehow he stays the same guy but becomes much better at the same time.<br />This version has a comment track I haven't heard and a documentary I'd like to see.  Since I already have my Groundhog Day DVD I'll be renting it for those features and grumbling that they weren't available when I bought.
6305263248|5.0|When I first saw &quot;Ronin&quot; in a theater it instantly tied for first place (along with &quot;Blade Runner&quot;) on my all-time favorites list. While not a film for casual viewing &quot;Ronin&quot; will reward an attentive viewer with insight on how to do a movie right. The pacing appears leisurely but this is deceptive. Every scene is loaded with visual cues that combine with each line of dialogue (and absence of dialogue) to constuct a mental image of contemporary international intrigue.<BR>&quot;Ronin&quot; is the term used in feudal Japan to describe masterless samurai. While it was generally used in a derogatory fashion to indicate warriors that had failed their master by allowing them to be slain it could also apply for other reasons, such as their no longer being needed for various reasons. Such is the case here with the principals being orphaned by the end of the Cold War. Left only with skills no longer in constant demand there is little choice beyond hiring themselves out on a contract basis.<br />John Frankenheimer obviosly chose the shooting locations with great care as each becomes, in effect, a cast member adding a vital element to the production. Often less than opulent they depict the mundane sites from which great, sometimes unknown, actions can originate.<BR>For action fans there are not one but two of the best car chase sequences ever filmed. The actors are intimately involved rather than being &quot;blue screened&quot; in. More importantly the sequences are fully justified by the plot developments as opposed to being thrown in as token action.<BR>Along with others I wish the DVD was a &quot;Special Edition&quot; but am content with the current release and it's director's narration which provides insight into not only the film but filmaking in general and Mr. Frankenheimer.<BR>A &quot;must have&quot; for any film fan.
B00000ILDF|5.0|I have to say that when I first saw this film I was not very impressed.  Like a lot of other people I was disappointed by what seemed to be a rather tepid sequel to Aliens.  Years later, after understanding a little more about it I began to realise how special this film really is.  The film is the directorial debut of David Fincher who later made Seven and Fight Club.<br />The films events take place immediately after the end of Aliens. Ripley, the lone survivor of a crashing escape capsule awakens on a prison colony inhabited by sex criminals.  Whilst recovering from the crash she attempts to find out why the spacecraft malfunctioned and if anything else survived the crash.  As the truth about her circumstances becomes clearer she is compelled to act or all her previous victories will be rendered meaningless. <br />I believe that Alien3 works on more levels than it has been previously given credit for and is not dissimilar to David Fincher's more recent film Seven.  Both Seven and Alien3 have a depressing and claustrophobic atmosphere.  Like Seven, Alien3 also features such themes as evil, sin and redemption.  <br />Certain elements established in the previous Alien films come into play here and are twisted into a fully functioning religious allegory.  In the previous films the goal for the main characters was to escape from the Aliens with their lives while fending off corrupt characters who wanted to keep the creatures to suit there own purposes.  In Alien3 the goal for the main characters is not survival but to kill the last of the creatures at any cost.   The characters have no weapons at their disposal but reluctantly accept the situation as there last chance to find redemption.  Alien3 is more about not letting evil succeed then the art of survival.  <br />Of the three films this one focuses more on the drama (rather then suspense or action) and is more psychological.  The characters are portrayed with considerable nuance; they lose confidence, become frustrated and are at times indecisive.  Some of the scenes are moving, others are horrible but the film is never sentimental.  Even the films most stirring scenes have a cynical edge to them.  A film such as this needs good acting and Alien3 doesn't have a poor actor in it. Elliot Goldenthal's soundtrack is also great.<br />One thing the film does not have though is a sense of discovery.  You see the Alien in the first half of the film and there is no Alien queen or huge set to look forward to.  The film is visually stunning but you know you've seen all they have to show you in the first half.  However these are not things the film really needs.<BR>This is one of my favourite films and I think it's great.  The Dvd extras are fairly minimal.
B00003CXXS|5.0|this may not be super acting material but it is far from trivial. Really well done, wonderful special effects, short and cut to the bone, excellent add on features.<BR>Hey after buying lots of books lately by favorite writers who are coasting to the bank this is great!
B000050FEN|5.0|I don't like Seven.  All who recommend it say it's a good film and that it is well made.  But did they like it?  Oh, no.  This is not a remake of Frank Capra's \\"It's a wonderful Life\\" but a film that is designed to depress.  The first time you see it is the worst.  You are subjected to events of nastiness that go far beyond gritty realism and just as you begin to hope there will be something resembling a happy ending it delivers the ultimate slap in the face.  This film is about sin, about how it corrupts the world around us and about how inescapable it is.<br />Brad Pitt has never been better and is well suited to character of Mills.  Morgan Freeman is great as always and Kevin Spacey also makes a brief but memorable appearance.  It is a film that also has a unique visual quality to it but it is the sound that really makes the atmosphere.  Using the sound to generate an atmosphere is a shrewd move because many won't notice it unless it's pointed out.  Barking dogs, car sirens, continual rain, there is no peace in this film and at times the ambient sounds drown out the dialogue.  (It's okay; the DVD has subtitles).  Compare Seven with most other films and you'll notice that sound is rarely used in such an artistic way.  <br />The DVD itself is very nice indeed.  The first disk has the film itself and four commentaries.  Everyone featured on the commentaries is honest about their experiences and when listening to them you begin to learn all kinds of things about the person speaking and the movie process.  David Fincher's contributions are the real price for me as Alien3 is one of favourite films and I found out a great deal more about him.  On the first commentary you'll find out more about Brad Pitt here than a years subscription to any gossip magazine.  Perhaps maybe two.  Morgan Freeman is also a pleasure to listen too.  It is remarkable to learn about what makes these people tick and what makes them laugh.  The commentaries also feature Richard Dyer; author of the BFI critique of Seven, and most of the material featured in the book is in the various commentaries.  Of course, four commentaries means you have to watch the film four times over.  A summary documentary would have been nice.<br />The second disc disappoints.  There isn't a great deal of material on it, only a few detailed scenes and other stuff.<br />Overall this is an excellent DVD for an excellent, but depressing, film.
B000002IJO|4.0|This band shows that it can continue to put out the sound that made them famous.  'Dance' is the single that made people buy this album but there are a number of good tunes.

So what if some of the songs sound a little similar...let's see you write ten songs, each totally diferent from eachother and nothing like what any other band has done...they are just a band not miracle workers! Ok, now that I have that off my back, I gotta say this cd is awsome! Well worth the money, each song is as perfect as it could be.
6305137293|3.0|I'm a big fan of this movie and I would love for a proper, deluxe edition to finally be released.  Instead we get a rather mediocre DVD--no anomorphic enhancement, and lousy in the extras department.<br />As a note, the television version of this film is different and contains quite a few extra scenes that were used to pad it out for the networks while violence was cut down.  Can we please have a COMPLETE version of this film that includes all of the extra TV footage as well as the blood and gore?<br />The missing scenes definitely fudge the continuity of the DVD release.  For instance, early in the film the hospital is a well-lit place with a little bit of activity.  Within minutes we see shots of the hallways in which the emergency UPS lights are on and the corridors are bathed in expressionistic shadows.  Fine, stylistically, but what gives?  Well, if you've seen the TV version, you know that the power goes out when Michael Meyers tampers with it.  (He did knock out the phone line, and this is clearly implicated.)  Suddenly the dwindling hospital staff are running scared down dark hallways chasing Laurie.<br />Also, there is additional dialogue between the doctors and nurses, increasing their too-short on-screen time, as well as extra footage of Jimmy and Laurie, and a different ending(!)  This makes the 2 versions quite different in my opinion.<br />I've never been too impressed with Goodtimes' VHS and DVD releases, and this is no exception.  All we get are some lame production notes.<br />As far as sequels go, especially in the slasher genre, this is definitely one of the better ones.  The main attraction is that it picks up RIGHT AFTER the original ends.  Essentially you can have a marathon of these 2 back to back and it's quite exciting.  This film emphasizes gore much more than the original (which was really bloodless).  And, like it or not, Michael Meyers does some pretty classic cliched slasher killer moves here, including getting inventive (needles, hot tubs, draining people of blood(!))  It does have a very creepy atmosphere, for which the film gets major points.  The camerawork is excellent for the most part, and Dick Warlock is a great Shape.  Missing again are extra scenes of him stalking around the hospital as well as closeups of the mask right before the hot tub dunking murder.<br />All in all, you may want to skip this particular release and pick up the more recent Universal DVD.  Although it is still the same exact movie (no more extras) there is apparently a much better picture and sound quality.<br />In my opinion, the first two Halloween films make a nice couple, and I feel so-so about the further lot of sequels that followed.  This film increased the creepiness of the original by making Michael some kind of (semi) unstoppable creature.<br />Another note, apparently Halloween II director Rick Rosenthal is helming the upcoming Halloween: The Homecoming in 2002.hot tubs, draining people of blood(!))

6305364613|5.0|I hadn't yet connected Romeo+Juliet to Strictly Ballroom via Baz Luhrman when I saw first this movie, and I was a little skeptical  about this whole skewing of the Bard thing.  All my hesitation disappeared.  It may have had something to do with John Leguizamo's performance (always a good choice, in my opinion), it may have had something to do with the brilliant soundtrack, or maybe the costuming, or maybe the sets.  More probably it is the way the whole is joined together in a way the sets off the original voice of Shakespeare, highlighting the violence and the passion, the poetry and the drama in a way that makes it sing and live.<br />It sparkles and it's brilliant in a way that was entirely unexpected, and that continues to be.

B00005B4GU|5.0|A synthesis of (opposition between) the diverse and the unified, the gap and the continuum, characterizes Amnesiac, like the clarinet playing of Jimmy Hastings (sideman on Caravan, Soft Machine, Hatfield and the North, National Health; member of the BBC Jazz Orchestra) on &quot;Life in a Glass House,&quot; hopscotching from progressive jazz to Dixieland to Kurt Weill, to Philip Glass. While the lyrics intone &quot;Once again we are hungry for a lynching,&quot; the trumpet and clarinet recall phrases from &quot;Strange Fruit.&quot; Everything new is uncomfortably familiar.

038533348X|5.0|I have heard it said that this wonderful book was written as a warning against blind advancement in science, but there is an interesting flip side, which is that a lack of understanding in science was evil whereas the creation was great.

0679879269|5.0|This is far and away the best book I have ever read. I couldn't put it down, and I still can't. After I finish the third book, I pick up the first book and start reading the trilogy all over again. I just love it so much! And \\"love\\" isn't the most common word for a 15 year old boy.<BR>I really enjoyed the ending. There are many people who complain about how sad it is, but think about what would happen if he didn't do that. It would be rather horrible in my opinion.<BR>So why did I say \\"could barely be better\\"? Some parts dont make sense to me, like how the monk tries so hard to get the locket off Ms. Coulter while she is sleeping, then just returns it lying next to her, or why Ms. Coulter didn't reveal Lyra's destiny to her, in a way sealing it.<BR>Anyways, if you haven't read this book you must. I wouldn't have done it either if not for my friends urging me to.<BR>If you really liked the trilogy and looking for more, the anime show \\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\" (the Japanese version, not the American)<BR>has many plot similarities, but of course it takes much longer to see the whole story.

November 5th proved to be quite an interesting day; i walked into my local walmart, purchased the new \\"Britney\\", and immediately popped the cd into my cd player. An infectious groovy r+b kind of song started playing... the beat was addictive and i soon was up and dancing. After listening to the cd i discovered that Britney was growing as an artist, she isnt quite all grown up but she isnt the same teeny bopper she was when she released \\"baby one more time\\"... In buying this cd you will be overcome by songs such as: \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Boys\\", \\"Not a girl, not yet a woman\\", and on the uk exclusive one of the best ballads from Britney \\"When I Found You\\"... this cd went above and beyond m expectations... Britney has truly made her mark on the music industry... Treat yourself to some good funky great music.... BUY BRITNEY!!!
B00005K3LU|5.0|Truly one great action film.  No action film since Die Hard has been able to come close to what this film has achieved.  Bruce Willis may be the star, but truly Alan Rickman's portrayal of villian Hans Gruber is what clearly made this movie what it is.  Rickman adds class and dignity to the villian, making you hope they can actually succeed with plans.  Now that is a great movie when you actually hope the villian, or how I see him, the Anti-Hero succeeds!

0064471837|5.0|I took an extended leave from the fantasy genre; yesterday afternoon, I decided to come back to the world of witchcraft and sorcery.  Highly recommended by fellow peers, I chose Garth Nix's well-known 'Sabriel'.  Frankly, I was so impressed and drawn into the story that I finished it in two days and rushed to write an amazingly complementary review.  So - I won't waste any time with summeries and the like, since I believe that has already been covered by other reviewers and the helpful staff of amazon.com.<br />The plot was fantastic and fast-paced; there wasn't a moment I wasn't on the edge of my seat.  Exhausting chapters of worthless garble is a common trait in many 'classic' fantasies.  Nix has created an extremely believable and well-versed world, without the fluff.  Poetic, dark, and forbidding, the heroine and companions are worthy of the world they are placed in.  I could simply close my eyes and fly across the borders of what is called the Old Kingdom, in all its dangerous beauty.  We are foreign visitors, as is the daring Sabriel.  The plot was clear, consise, yet not overly simplictic.  It begins as a search and rescue mission, and ends in a rich battle to save both the old and new aspects of this odd world.<br />Characters - wonderful.  As rich as the world they reside in, Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget fully impressed me.  They all read amazingly like living people, rather than a work of fantasy.  Mogget, especially - his duel personalities clash wickedly, and he is not always what he appears to be; a cat? free magic?<br />To end this tiring review of a not-so-tiring story, I will add that this work is new, creative, and bold.  There is a striking combination of modern technology and medieval swords and bows; a wall devides the two areas of the world.  Many embrace magic, and others fear it - rightly so, for the wall does little to hold back the Greater Dead, a fearful object of the Old Kingdom.<br />Following in her father's footsteps, Sabriel will not fail the reader in a quest for a good read.  SABRIEL is a tale of necromancy, fantastical lands, Death, and much more.  I have not read a good book in a long time, yet this has broken my stream of bad luck.el will not fail the reader in a quest for a good read.

B00005T30L|4.0|This is a great movie and one very few people are even famailir with. I had not planned on buying it actaully and would have not even seen it it till it hit pay per veiw in about six weeks but I was at the store looking around and saw it was out early and said what the hey and went ahead and spent twenty bucks and bought it with the beverly hills cop 1 and 2. I got home and opened the dvd and inserted it and was doumbfounded how great the story was. Steve Buessmii and Theora Birch should get oscar consideretion and the supporting cast of illeina Douglas and Scralett Johnson were good also. The only reason this is not getting five stars is dvd, It is a medicore release in terms of features I mean Bubble boy even has a commeentery track not that anybody would listen to it. Why did it not have atleat one, Another Mgm title I own Whats the Worst that could happen actaully has two as does Legally Blonde. This is a smart, Funny sad and charming movie all at once. So many movies have no intelligiance this one does. The movie is rated R for frequent profinity, But there is no sex or violence so if you are 14 it should be okay. In canda its rated 14a. The dvd does have a few features the theaatrical trailer which I had never seen before,a music spot for the soundtrack, Princess Bride and Termintor dvd spots, A few altrenate scenes, a rare music clip for Jaun Pehee Cahnn Perfomed by Mouhmand Rafi I did not really care for this and don't see why its on here and a brief 12 minute featuretee featuring intreviews with cast and crew.If the dvd had more features it would be nice, but am sure when this movie wins some award a new special edtion will be released and to tell you the truth I don't even mind buying it again.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore's score for &quot;The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is both a delightful surprise and quite simply the best orchestral score of the year; indeed, it may be the perfect musical companion to what many consider to be the literary epic of the 20th century.  Shore's music is at once subtle, grand, frightening and moving.  It is quite simply a dynamic work.  Now, all of that said, there is one problem which itself attests to the quality of this piece...the soundtrack includes only representative parts of the full score, and one can only wonder what may follow over the next two years and beyond (perhaps a mamouth collection for the entire ring trilogy).  Note should also be made that some of the tracks play a bit differently than the music on the screen, and in all cases it is better...note the dramatic horn flourish at the end of &quot;Flight to the Ford&quot; and additional vocals in &quot;Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; that do not appear in the film.  Elements of this work come from Enya and they are wonderful.  &quot;May it Be&quot; will be yet another hit and so it should be.  The soundtrack is adequately packaged, though the use of different cover photos may cause the buyer some reason to pause (don't panic, the same photos are available elsewhere, one need not purchase five copies of the soundtrack).  One last question...what is the release date for the sountrack to &quot;The Two Towers&quot;?
B00005QZ7U|5.0|As a previous reviewer said,  please sit through the first 15 or so minutes, and you will be rewarded.   The director does a great job by creating a state of &quot;suspended reality&quot;. Photography and special effects are a treat for the eyes.  You will have the experience of a Broadway play.  Kidman and McGregor are great together.  You'll want to see it again and buy the sound track.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I bought this DVD because my niece has plaed my VHS edition to nothingness and I was not disappointed.  The movie itself has never looked nor sounded better, but it is the extras that are worth the price.  The interactive Magic Mirror is fantastic - taking even the novice to numerous things to explore.  The game really tests the viewers ability to recall even minute details of the film - who actually knows which instrument each Dwarf plays  The background materials provided fascinating tidbits about everything from abandoned concepts to info about the voice talents.  I never knew that the voice of the prince was the father of Dean Stockwell who played &quot;Al&quot; on Quantum Leap.   I really enjoyed the walk through time provided by some of Disney's best actors, but where was Dame Julie?  But the creme de la creme was Barbra's beautiful rendition of &quot;Some Day My Prince will Come.&quot;  I can't wait until the next DVD in the series (Beauty and the Beast) is introduced next year since the nearest IMAX screen is in Chicago.
0688170528|4.0|The Pact is by far my favorite Picoult.  The story is so moving - leaving you so much to think about, almost like you are solving a mystery - a courtroom mystery.  This very adult novel brings back teen memories about the power of love along with the heartbreaks of being a parent.  I could not put it down.  A good friend and I loved this book so much and had so many discussions about it that we decided to start a book club.
014028902X|5.0|I first read this delightful book in sixth grade.  I believe the book had just been published.  The Durrell family found a place in my heart and they are still there, arguing happily, all these years later.  This is the type of book  that needs to be re-read every five years or so.  There are so many levels to the book that as one matures, it can be enjoyed anew with each re-reading. <BR>     The book, an autobiography, traces the life and adventures (both as he explores Corfu and with his large, slightly dotty family)of the young boy, Gerry. One cannot help learning about various flora and fauna, and the book also revels in dry humor; so much that the reader will find himself/herself laughing uncontrollably.<BR>   The late Gerald Durrell brings the island of Corfu, Greece into one's brain and it is as if one had been there.  The bright, hot sun, the cerulean blue ocean, the whitewashed houses ... and most of all, the slow-paced, often maddening outlook of the Greek people all help bring this book alive. To paraphrase Durrell: While on Corfu, it is good not to grasp reality too tightly, but rather to accept the lovely, unexpected siren-song of the island. <BR>     I highly recommend this book, from about sixth grade through adult.
0385505833|4.0|Ok, I wasn't too sure about buying the book, but I did and thought it was well worth it. I needed a little time out to read something cute. My mother told me that she thought the book was cute so I thought I would try it.<br />Well, I thought the book was delightful. It's true how much you spend on Christmas get's out of control. It was just a silly book but very well written. I would say, you want a little funny reading, read this book!
1895565669|3.0|This is one of those books I have mixed feelings on so I can only give it 3 stars.  There is nothing wrong with a woman loving her child and holding her child and singing to him or her.  However, there is a creepiness to this book that just can't be denied.  On the one hand, it can be construed as a children's book and most kids wouldn't get the creepiness or weird feeling from it.  Adults, however, don't feel comfortable with it.  And as the librarian in another review said, there's almost a Norman Bates feel to it.  You can almost hear \\"oh God mother, what have you done!\\" ala Psycho.<br />On the other hand, it has a very touching ending that brought tears to my eyes.  I think there is a good message to it and I don't think there is anything wrong with it for the most part.  Its how adults perceive it.  Creepy and co-dependent is one way or beautiful and heartfelt another.  There is no middle ground with \\"Love You Forever\\".  One thing though a few people brought up I found interesting is how we would perceive it if it was a father and daughter.  I think people would all see it as creepy.  So in a way, its easy to see where the negative reviews are coming from.<br />So it might be something you don't buy for a friend's baby shower or someone you don't know.
0743201140|5.0|One of the best of hundreds of books I have read over the years on the &quot;how-to&quot; of leadership. The only one with a new twist, taking a test on-line to discover your strengths. To be a truly &quot;good-leader&quot; you need to understand the philosophical basis of leadership, as well as learn the how-to of leadership. For that, there is no other book that makes the &quot;philosophy of leadership&quot; so easy to understand than a book called &quot;West Point&quot;, by Norman Thomas Remick. After you read &quot;Now, Discover Your Strengths&quot; by Buckingham and Clifton, go on and fill in your leadership education. Become one of those rare birds that knows the rest of the story of leadership.
0307162095|1.0|These are great books, but....   I expected the board book versions for my toddler son and the light cardboard with pokey plastic binding was a real dissapointment.  There's no way these books will hold up to the demands of my kids.  I put them away for read with mommy time only.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is the first book of the Ender Universe, probably one of the most important science fiction milestones of 20th Century.  Written following every thought and deed of Andrew Wiggin, it is mostly a relation of the events of 3 years of his life, when he is depicted as a the most promising child genius of Earth, trained to become a general commander against the 3rd alien war.   Card succeeds showing with great intensity and a voice full of truthfulness what a genius child would do in a situation where the future of human race would eventually lie in his hands.   From the first pages, it deftly make us feel empathy and admiration for the strength and morality of the little kid and a fervent desire for him to succeed.  I think it's mostly a fight of a tragic hero, Ender, who is object of fateful situations where to win he has to do what he abhors most: to kill.  And how he is tricked and manipulated into using his abilities to do whatever the generals of the Fleet would want.   It all results in great surprises that exhilarate the avid reader.<br />I think the book as a whole is brilliant and also well structured. I mean, it has a nice pace although at the end is so fast that your head spins. I also like the way he writes it, from Ender's point of view. It's very clever as a whole and very believable as a story although it's quite contrived. Of course I love stories of geniuses, they are always very exciting and surprising.   <br />Ender, in contrast, is a very introspective person, but it's from there where his strength comes.  He knows what to do to gain power, leadership and just and plainly win.   He knows no failure.  We learn to love him for his physical weakness, for his struggle to be self sufficient, to do what is right, to beat the odds no matter what gigantic chances are against him.  He has the ability to earn love.
0783225849|5.0|Out of all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, \\"Psycho\\" is probably his most well known, largely due to a little scene that takes place in a bathroom. But this movie is far more than that. It is a deep psychological thriller, with Anthony Perkins giving a signature performance as the disturbed Norman Bates. <br />Marion Crane (Janet Leigh in another signature performance) is a thief who is on the run after stealing some money. On her way, she stops over at the Bates Motel, little knowing what is in store for her. But Norman Bates doesn't kill Marion because of himself but because of his mother, who is jealous at her. But who really is Norman's mother? Who really is Norman? <br />Recently the American Film Institute, in another controversial list, named \\"Psycho\\" as \\"America's Most Thrilling Movie\\". It is no surprise, considering its many famous and surprising scenes, including the ending. This film has been the inspiration of many horror movies like \\"Halloween\\", \\"Friday the 13th\\" and \\"Scream\\". It has been parodied and spoofed countless times and has even been followed up by sequels and a remake (None of which were particularly good). But even after all this plus 4 decades of age, the movie has lost none of its original power.
B00005UEAR|5.0|For a long time, I had trouble deciding which Dream theater album was the best. Now I can lay that problem to rest. 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence has all the elements of Dream Theater at their best. Jordan Rudess has added some spark in this band. <br />1.Glass Prison-WOAH! I never expected them to be so heavy. This destroys the rumors that Dream Theater has gone soft. Absolutely incredible. 5/5<br />2.Blind Faith-Following on the tradition of Trial of Tears, this has a King's X sort of feel to it. It's definetly more radio friendly. Nice keyboard intro. 5/5<br />3.Misunderstood-Simply put, one of their best ballads ever. I love the creepy ending. How the hell do they do that? 5/5<br />4.The Great Debate-Are you sure this isn't Tool? This sounds like something they'd do. Great beginning, and very intresting lyrics about cloning. I guess they're against, with the line \\"Are you satisfied/In taking life to save life.\\" 5/5<br />5.Dissapear-I hope this becomes a single. Excellent song. Very depressing, but very cool. 5/5<br />6.6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence-WOW! This is Dream Theater taking a stab at being an old prog-rock band. Very uplifting. There's some classical sounding stuff in there as well. Truly amazing. 5/5<br />Get it today. Probably the best album of 2002.
B000056K04|1.0|Yes, this album is better than your average pop that one hears nowadays.  However, I don't think that excuses Dave Matthews Band.  This band has proven with earlier releases that it is a notch above other bands.  They have such a unique lineup and such a talented ensemble, that it seems such a waste to throw it all away on songs like the ones on this album.<br />Occasionally, it sounds like they are trying to be funky, but really don't quite pull it off here.  Furthermore, this album has an over-produced quality, as though Ballard felt a need to cover up the brilliance with which most of the band members play (Stefan Lessard isn't exactly a great bassist, but the others are very good).<br />I just don't understand WHY and HOW this album came into being.  They're so much more creative than this album would show.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This was without a doubt the funniest movie I have ever seen. The scene with the witch makes me laugh harder and harder each time. John Cleese make a fantastic performance in this movie, and the dreaded Black Knight seems to be in denial of his plight, which makes you wonder why he's so dreaded. The mention of llamas and sacking people in the opening credits only makes for this to be the most fantastic satire ever created. The only slow part was the castle of hard-up virgins. Otherwise, this would be a great addition to your DVD collection.
B00005RYQO|2.0|Apparently, I've developed a penchant for stink-bomb movies.  This latest one, The Fast and the Furious, may have set the weekly low.   Like, almost (but not quite) as bad as Mission to Mars.  Anyway, between dialogue that makes no sense and vague gearhead references that probably aren't even accurate, my favorite scene is where they're going after a team of inner city hijackers for stealing $1,200,000 in...  DVD players.  Now, the average retail of a DVD player is about $150.  That means that the team of hijackers has apparently stolen and fenced about 8,000 DVD players.  Hmmm...  Sounds like a lot of work.  Perhaps they should switch to selling drugs.  Anyway, stay away from this one...  although the ultra-testosterone laden storyline is good for a laugh.
B000002UA9|4.0|I got this album today and listened to it twice. I think it's a great album, but there's too many love songs. But, I shouldn't whine, because that's what was 'in' at the time. This is where it all began, my friend. The killer debut. Some songs good, some bad. I love &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;A Taste Of Honey,&quot; yet &quot;Chains&quot; and &quot;Anna&quot; are too boring. Yet, who could not love &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;? I think George is the best player in the group. John's singing needs work, however. Good debut.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The movie is perfect; the soundtrack is perfect. Looking forward to more . . .
0385495323|5.0|This is an incredible book that speaks on all major subjects concerting cryptography. Buy it today!
B00004YKUX|5.0|Mr. Cash is one of the few who can take any song and make it his own. This is one touching piece of work.
B000002O1Q|5.0|The Blue Shadow, One Bad Stud, Nowhere Fast.... I want this CD played at my wake. I would love this CD even if I had never seen the movie. As it is, when I get to feeling too old, or too disgusted, I put in this CD, roll down the windows, and cruise. It's like a time machine....when this music is playing I am invunerable and nothing but good s**t happens.
B00005QK3W|4.0|My sister-in-law gave me this CD for Christmas [ I was kinda expecting 'All Things Must Pass']. She didn't waste her money- in fact she went out and bought one herself to listen to when she drove back to Florida after I told her how much I liked it. I'm ashamed to admit that it's the first McCartney album that I've listened to for at LEAST ten years. I'm so tough on most music nowadays that it takes a really good album for me to give it four stars.
B000002V07|5.0|It's been five years since I've placed this CD in my player again. When I heard that Hope Sandoval had released a new CD with a new band, I decided to listen again to this CD. And all the wonderful memories I had when I listened to it in 1993 all came back! <br />I first heard the track Fade Into You in a very intimate club and was just mesmerized by it that I bought the CD then. Suffice it to say, I lost my virginity to this track.
0446608955|4.0|When I first bought the book, I thought, &quot;oh, no! another boring, sappy teen romance.&quot;  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This book is a coming-of-age story of Landon Carter, a rebellous senior in high school, and Jamie Sullivan, the intelligent, God-fearing girl who everyone makes fun of.  Landon slowly begins to fall in love with Jamie as he spends more time with her after having to star in the school drama and after she convinces him to help out at the orphanage.  He slowly sees her transform in his mind from a sweet, innocent, old-fashioned girl who doesn't care what anything thinks about her to someone who has faith in him and whose energy and love astound him.  Together, their love for each other helps them to battle obstacles that cross their paths.  Landon's immaturity and rebellousness gradually fades as he realizes how much he needs and loves Jamie.  A guaranteed tear-jerker that will make you wanting a Landon of your own.  I also highly recommend the movie even you don't like the book.  The movie is absolutely incredible.
B000001FRY|5.0|I remember 1980 we living in Soviet Repressive System with Mr Brezhnev and KGB controlling Russia and many boring Soviet approved musician on Radio Moscow, but we also listen to cool radio stations from West. I hear &quot;I Will Follow&quot; although reception not good and feel thrilling sound and much excitement more powerful than heavy Soviet propahganda about West. It is the sound of Western freedom and we are determined to buy Western Irish great music of U2. It is name of Spy Plane, but we are only thinking goood things of this creazy rock and roll called New Wave. Finally the new wave came to the East
0345451325|5.0|This book had me hooked by the 2nd paragraph! Great story, and a wonderful collection of characters. The master chief <BR>was so compelling, he is both terrifyingly brutal one minute and then seems to posess a childlike innocence the next. Excellent! My only complaint is when and where can I get the next book in this saga. Don't tell me I have to play the game to revisit the characters because that's just not the same as reading the wonderful story that Eric Nylund has woven in this book.
B00005TT77|4.0|Not perfect, some songs sound so different that we may not like them, but some may sound Great. Over all it is a very nice CD.
B00005YUPO|4.0|Not as good as Mozart, better than Solieri.<BR>Seriously, this is a good video.  It has less music than does the Baby Mozart DVD, and it isn't as good as holding my daughter's attention, even though the format is the same.  What can I say, I prefer Mozart as a composer also.  Still, it is a nice diversion and a good introduction to classical music.
B00005RFVL|5.0|I wasn't too sure whether to buy \\"Swing When You're Winning\\", and being the skeptical person that I can be, I didn't know if Robbie could pull of doing an entire cover album of swing music. My mind was automatically changed when I heard Robbie's duet with Nicole Kidman on \\"Somethin' Stupid\\". I was impressed and just fell in love with this swinging cover. So I ordered the cd and I just finished listening to it right now. I was completely blown away by what I heard. What ever Robbie intended to accomplish with this cd he succeeded. His covers of classic swing music were excellent and echoes the same spirit the songs had when they first were recorded back. I particularly enjoyed his covers of \\"Mack the Knife\\", \\"Somethin' Stupid\\", and \\"Things\\". Robbie couldn't have sounded any better than he did on this cover album. \\"Sing When You're Winning\\" is an excellent appetizer until he releases a full-length album of original material.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I read all of the member reviews for \\"Requiem\\" and there is little to add in way of praise for this astonishing film. It is ashamed that this \\"Requiem\\" got lost in the shuffle of drug films, last year. It is a far better film than the cooly detached \\"Traffic\\" or the inane \\"Blow\\". This should be the last film made on the subject of drug addiction...there is really nothing more to say. Aronofsky has made a film that captures the paradoxical pleasure/pain principle of addiction. The axiom of \\"Requiem\\" is this: All of us stand dangerously near the threshold of self-consumption. The monkey is waiting to jump on your back everywhere you go: the doctor's office, the liquor store, behind the Wall Mart, the playground, or the beach. As we watch friends and family spiral out of control, we realize that this could be OUR family, OUR friends; all of us.<br />The entire cast of the film was daring, and took chances with tainting their images by portraying such nakedly vunerable characters. These were roles that many actors would take a pass on, because of the emotional toll that a film like this demands on the human psyche. It is reavealing that Hollywood chose Julia Roberts, their own \\"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\\", over outsider Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress. Ms. Burstyn is a fearless and consumate actress and she will be remembered for this role...and twenty years from now \\"Requiem\\" will be remembered as THE drug film.
B00000JHAU|5.0|In some ways Belle and Sebastian were almost a recurrence of a Glaswegian archetype. Hip, smart kids obsessed with utopian 1960s pop and boasting a healthy lack of interest in kissing corporate... have always been an illuminating presence on the Glasgow underground, with a lineage that runs back through the likes of The Pastels and Orange Juice. <br />At their best - and 1996's If You're Feeling Sinister is still their strongest set of songs - they perfectly capture that delirious anything-could-happen feeling that hits you as you start to leave your teens behind and discover girls, books, boys, Glasgow late at night, music and venereal disease. Songwriter and vocalist Stuart Murdoch has a fantastic eye for the surrealism of everyday life and a deep compassionate joy in the world that is unrivalled outside Bill Forsyth's Gregory's Girl - that other classic piece of west-coast urban mythology. <br />The Fox In The Snow is a beautifully lisped paean to directionless outsiders, waiting just for life to happen to them, while Like Dylan In The Movies, with its hallucinogenic brass fantasias and lonely late-night atmospherics, works like dream logic as Dylan's benign presence hovers over a long walk home. But it's The Stars Of Track And Field that really caps the set, a fantastically funny and poignant rumination on the loneliness of the small-town sports star. It's a record that constantly reminds you of just how magical Glasgow can be, if only you know where to look. So start right here.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Decide whether or not you like the movie without worrying about the people who strongly hate it because someone told them it was racist (although I thought it was clear the Japanese were doing what they thought to be honorable, despite it being against the &quot;good guys&quot;) or for whatever reasons they didn't like it.  Make up your own mind about that.  I enjoyed the movie - and it is a fictional movie, not a documentary by any means - but I won't buy it on DVD until they come out with a version that doesn't split the movie itself between two disks - put the all extras on the second disk, and the whole movie on the first.  I don't think it was so long that it wouldn't fit, but the intrusion in the middle is unforgivable.  I'll buy it as soon as the whole movie is on one disk!
0140187650|5.0|A lot has been written and said about the Holocaust. This small book by a respected philosopher about the trial of Eichmann in Jerusalem is the largest and most thought provoking of them all. Why? Because it analizes through the personal experience of an \\"employee\\" of the killing machine, the intimate aspect of evil, how banally can it stem out of the most ordinary persons. Rosseau wrote that \\"homo homini lupus\\" and Arendt clearly follows up. It also provides factual historical insight about how the Nazi solution to the jewish problem evolved from expatriation or relocation to physical annihilation. From another perspective, that of the victims, answers the question that many other authors ignore or circumvent. How so few (in the R.S.H.A. and S.S.) could find, control and deport so many ? In almost all the countries the hearding of the victims and their shipment could not have happened without the active participation of the Jewish Councils and other jewish authorities which were empowered by the Nazis for that purpose. The self delusion of the leaders of the jewish communities is clearly recorded by Arendt up to the appalling and pathetic case of Dr. Kastner in Hungary who saved 1,684 people at a cost of 476,000 victims. From a juridical standpoint, Arendt valiantly raises certain doubts about the fairness of the trial. It also analizes the political impact of Eichmann's veredict and its influence upon future trials (in Germany) of Nazi war criminals. THIS CONTROVERSIAL BOOK IS A MUST FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN THE TRAGEDY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION,THE POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT LED TO EICHMANN'S ABDUCTION AND TRIAL AND THE REAL WORKINGS OF THE HOLOCAUST.
6302787068|5.0|&quot;Aladdin&quot; is another delightful Disney classic, with a simple plot, which is easier to follow on than 'Beauty and the Beast.' A &quot;street rat&quot; homeless young man, Aladdin, is targeted for opening a magical cave by a sinister adviser, Jafar. Inside the cave lies piles of treasure. But the most precious item in the cave that Jafar wants-a magic lamp with a genie (voiced by the scene-stealing Robin Williams).<br />A movie that ranks along with 'Beauty and the Beast' with its delightful animation, genuine suspense, wonderful score by Alan Menken and Tim Rice, hilarious one-liners by Gilbert Gottifried (Jafar's wise-cracking pet parrot) and the Genie, sweet romantic songs, and a plot that will please adults as well as the kiddies.<br />A movie that doesn't exactly exceed the original plot that the wonderful 'Beauty and the Beast' had, &quot;Aladdin&quot; succeeds by wit and charm, and is in a way, great.
0345440803|5.0|I have an 18 month old &quot;Spirited&quot; toddler.  He wakes up at 7 am and is busy nonstop until 7:30 pm.  He naps about an hour and seems to get by just fine on that little nap.  That's parenting, though, and his energy is not the problem.  His temperment, on the other hand, is often trying on my patience.  Being pregnant with our second child and the wife of an active duty military pilot (who is fighting for us overseas), it gets to be a very long day at home with my son's &quot;spirit&quot;.  This book helped me to identify better with his personality and help to make his day go more smoothly, and thus, making my day a little better and easier as well.  I found great tips on how to work with his temperment as to not take away his spirit and to give him more choices to help him be more independent and confident. <br />I think the book offers sensible advice and good techniques.  There is always a lot of controversy about this versus attachement parenting.  Tracy Hogg doesn't suggest you don't hug and cuddle your baby, as the review above mine suggests, she merely suggests you work with your toddler on their behavior and hugs and cuddles aren't always the answer.  I can see with a young baby this book may not be a good choice, but with an active toddler who is learning how to get what he wants and manipulate, come mild discipline is needed to stay sane and remind your child that you are still the parent.  <br />I owe a lot of my new-found sanity to this book.
B00000I8BX|5.0|This being my first FF CDs, and one of the first few metal CDs I bought, this completely blew me away. FF sound more mature on this album, much more organized than the others I mean. Also I might add that this album is much more bass and sample ridden than the other ones (not that that's a bad thing). I tell you about how the band sounds on this album. <BR>   Dino, guitar- Dino sounds as great as always. While he slows it down a little on Obsolete, he's still very fast. Very heavy, and still one of the best guitarists to pick up the 7-string guitar. His ballad, \\"Descent\\", is INCREDIBLE.<BR>   Burton, vocals- Burton sounds his best on this album (or at least I think so). He still screams like a madman, but shows he can sing on songs like \\"Descent\\". <BR>   Christian, bass- I think Christian sounds his best on this album as well. He's very low and heard a lot more on this album. Just listen to \\"Edgecrusher\\" and \\"Descent\\" and you'll get me. <BR>   Raymond, drums- Heh, still one of the best drummers around. He still fast and still very intriquet. <BR>Well their you have it. Buy this immediatly! Best songs are \\"Descent\\", \\"Shock\\", \\"0-0 (where evil dwells)\\"*, \\"Messiah\\"*, and \\"Freedom of Fire\\". (*= bonus trax) P.S.- Buy this version cuz the extra tracks are awesome.
0688170528|5.0|THE PACT was one of the only books I have read that has given me a physical pain inside when I read it.<BR>It made me really think about the issues involved in it. Can I maintian an open and honest relationship with my children as they grow into teens? Have I ever experienced a love so great with another human being so as I would do as they wished even when it would destroy me?<BR>This book was wonderful. I cried for 2 days while I was reading it and it still haunts me now, two days after I have finished. I am definately going right out and getting more books by this author.
B00004Z459|4.0|I started listening to LP when this CD came out (a long time ago it seems). I was really impressed, with their unique blend of techno, rap, and metal. Even though I think they've let fame get to their heads, I still like 'em a lot. The Band=<BR>   Chester, vocals- Great vocalist. He sings EXTREMELY well, and he's got one heck of a scream (ie. &quot;Myself&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot;). <BR>   Rob, drums- An all-in-all good drummer, but I think if he added double bass drumz he'd sound better. Great stuff on &quot;In The End&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot;.<BR>   Brad, guitar &amp; bass (guitarist live)- Probably the main driving force of LP. He's a great guitarist, probably one the greatest in the nu-metal scene today. It's cool that he plays both bass and guitar (like me!), too.<BR>   Hahn, samples/turntables/keyboards- Hahn is the greatest sampler I've heard used in a band PERIOD. Yes, Slipknot's sampler Craig is awesome, but this guy is even better. He used in almost every song, and creatively fills in the spaces in songs with cool sound effects. His keyboarding skills are great on &quot;In the End&quot;.<BR>   Mike, vocals- Mike is the more aggressive vocalist in LP, and he does most (if not all)of the rapping. He raps quite well, I might add.<BR>    Also, Scott is the live bassist. Now about LP's music. It's not as heavy as it is melodic, but its still pretty damn heavy. I also think the idea of two vocalists is pretty cool. Please don't get caught up in all the TRL poop and really listen to LP's music before judging it. Enjoy. P.S.- I gave this album only 4 stars cuz, even though this album is great, they've been living on it for about 2 years now. They need to come out with a new album!
B00003CWNR|5.0|I was moved by the emotional depth of this movie. The cast, music, scenery and costumes were all top notch. Have some tissues on hand, for this one will touch your heart.
B00004Z400|5.0|I am very impressed by the Deftones. This album is great. First off, I'll tell you about the band. Chino Moreno (vocals/guitar) is an incredible singer. His scream is freakin' scary, and he can sing very very well. Just check out &quot;Digital Bath&quot; (my favorite track) and &quot;Teenager&quot;, and you'll know what I mean. Abe Cunningham's drums are great and he's a very complex drummer. Chi Cheng's bass is well heard most of the time, and he's a great bassist. Frank Delgado's turntables aren't really heard much on this album (maybe it's just me), plus he's new on this album. Finally, the master, Stephen Carpenter. Stephen's guitar style is very unique and heavy. He mixes thundering riffs with beautiful melodies. He really shines on tracks like &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, &quot;Change&quot;, and &quot;Knife Prty&quot;, an also on &quot;Teenager&quot; if that really is a guitar (is it a keyboard or the guitar making the music?). Deftones sound like heavier Tool, I think. This is an incredible album, certainly a must-buy. Check out songs 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 (an AWESOME song w/ Maynard), 11, and 12.
6305297207|4.0|Ah, to be young, low of budget, and inventive.<br />Such was the predicament Sam Raimi et al found themselves in back in 1982.  A head brimming with ideas for odd-angled shots, staccato editing (two Raimi devices used to great effect in one of my favourite films, \\"The Quick and The Dead\\"), and better methods for splattering gore was all that Raimi took into the Tennessee woods with him (oh, and the indispensable Bruce Campbell tagged along too).  What he came out with was a film that manages to be simultaneously sophisticated, primitive, gruesome, and hilarious: \\"The Evil Dead\\".<br />While not as blatant about its task as its more polished sequel ('polished' being a relative term), Raimi's first trip down splatterfest lane intends to mock horror movie conventions with all the glee of an omnipotent slasher.  So when someone goes to check the dark cellar, or a mysterious sight up ahead in the woods (\\"You stay here... I'll be RIGHT BACK!\\"), they're gone for a longer time than usual.  The audience, used to the length of such scenes, will actually get antsy that Our Hero has perished.  When a hand quickly grabs the wrist of a helpless young woman, it's not always the demon of our nightmares, but the young lady's beau.  During the climactic showdown between the deadites and Ash, Ash is repeatedly thrown against a wall, only to get trapped underneath a flimsy fallen bookshelf.  It comically couldn't have a more inextricable grip on him than if it was a giant octopus.  And for such a small, deserted cabin, it sure has a lot of doors and rooms through which evil can hide.  The Labyrinth was less daedal.<br />The one drawback here, besides the wooden acting, is the complete lack of story, character development or social message (okay, so that's three drawbacks).  To sum up, five young friends go for a vacation weekend in a deserted cabin deep in the Tennessee woods, where they accidentally wake up the spirits of the dead (story).  Ash dates Shelly, Scotty dates Linda, and Cheryl is Ash's sister (character development).  And as for social messages, well, it could be construed as having a shrewd environmental commentary: after years of mankind raping the forests, here we have a forest raping a young woman (a deliciously shocking scene).  But that's probably giving the filmmakers too much credit.<br />Regardless, there's surely enough blood and dismemberment, of both the sincere and sidesplitting variety, to satisfy your appetite for carnage.  And enough laughs, of both the intentional and unintentional variety, to keep you laughing between screams.
B00000JTB2|3.0|I have read all the glowing reviews.  I respectfully dissent.  Does no one hear that Albert King is out of tune and his abilities have slipped, and that the chit chat between songs is boneheaded?  History is history -- I recognize the awe-inspiring contributions made by both players over the years, but this is not particularly meaningful work by either man.  Band is slick but readings of these songs are rather glib.  All in all, a great photo, a great idea, but not executed with any coherence.  Brilliant moments here and there, but I think Stevie Ray and Albert would cringe at most of the recording.  Listen to their best work -- this piece is just a footnote.
B00005YUPO|2.0|After we realized our son liked the Baby Mozart DVD, we decided to purchase more in the series. Being huge classical music fans we decided Baby Bach was the next logical choice. We are rather disappointed with Baby Bach, though. For one, our son (who is almost 1) doesn't seem at all interested in it (and it's not that he doesn't like Bach; he has the Pipe toy and loves to play with it - I've also written a review of that in the Toys area). Secondly, and this is probably just my personal bias, but there's just waaaay too much of the Clark children talking and dancing - it really interrupted the flow. Regarding the flow in general, the whole Theatre presentation seemed just thrown together: clumsy, illogical transitions and lots of extraneous sounds. I would recommend folks skip this one - if you get it as a gift, see if your child likes it, but don't spend the money yourself.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you've seen the other two films from Baz, Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet, you've got a premise as to what to expect from his films.  His films grow on you.  I recall my first watch of Strictly Ballroom started out with me fidgeting and wondering what the bonkers this rinky dinky Australian flick was about.  By the end I was hooked.<br />Baz likes to use other forms of art to carry his stories, and he uses live, colorful characters to suspend the tale.  In 'Ballroom,' it was ballroom dancing that aided in telling the tale.  In Romeo and Juliet, it was the language of Shakespeare that was the method of storytelling.  In Moulin Rouge, it's song.  Music is truly the language of the heart in this case.<br />To be able to enjoy Moulin Rouge, you have to be able to surrender yourself to suspended disbelief.  You have to realize you're watching something to the likes of a fairy tale.  Where an orthodox method of making a film is to make it as realistic as you possibly can, Moulin Rouge takes the exact opposite approach.  Traditionally, the film should seem so realistic that audiences are easily convinced the story is real and are easily caught up in it.  Moulin Rouge never hides behind any such pretense- the story is fiction and the creators have embraced it as such.<br />Think of Moulin Rouge as an impressionist painting, or impressionist movie, I should say.  What I love about this movie is, like it's predecessor Strictly Ballroom, the story is simple, and the themes are perhaps even innocent and naive.  Yet, it goes to show that even the simplest of stories, as long as they are sincere, can tug and pull at heartstrings just as well as any other movie.<br />Originally, I had intended to give Moulin Rouge only 4 stars, but then I thought about it and changed it to 5.  Nobody has attempted something like this before in mainstream film making, and Baz has only gotten bolder and braver with each movie.  <br />The movie is meant to be rushed and maddening.  You're watching what's going on through Christian's (played by Ewan McGregor) eyes.  Everything happens to him in a flurry, so instead of watching the character get swept up in the flurry, the audience gets hit over the head with the rush, as well.  Very brave decision on the director's part.<br />It's an &quot;impressionist movie.&quot;  Just as Picasso's works don't look like anything it was inspired upon in real life, Moulin Rouge is like nothing you've ever seen, but it is everything you've ever felt.  From the lightheaded joy and bliss of first love to the destructive pains of jealousy, and finally loss and heartache, it's everything we've all felt.  Fitting to say, Moulin Rouge is a fine statement of a movie- a statement of the 20th century as a whole, not just the time frame the film was set in.<br />Ewan McGregor plays his character splendidly.  He's every bit the anxious, yearning, sincere and naive young man his character was meant to be.  Nicole Kidman, though not she didn't seem as wide-eyed about love as Ewan's character did, expresses her feelings in a very repressed manner, which I feel is more appropriate for her character considering her situation.  Both their performances are sincere, and Ewan's performance is very, very powerful.  Plus, Moulin Rouge includes a colorful myriad of other characters (played exceptionally well, as well), bursts of songs, and plenty of high powered dancing, none of which ever detract from the plot but add to it.  What's not to like?<br />p.s. Who knew Ewan could sing like that?!
B00005QATY|5.0|Only the Coen Brothers could loosely base a film on THE ODYSSEY, set it in rural 1930s Mississippi, change the lead character from a war hero to an escaped chain-gang convict, and make the movie work successfully. The plot of the movie is that Ulysses \\"Everett\\" McGill, Pete, and Delmar are three convicts, chained together, who have escaped and are on the run to supposedly fine some loot (1.2 million dollars to be exact) that \\"Everett\\" buried before he was put in the pen. Along the way they meet a variety of characters from a blind railroad man, a one-eyed Bible salesman, three beautiful sirens washing clothes in the river, and George \\"Babyface\\" Nelson. Throw in a Klu Klux Klan meeting that starts off in a rousing musical number that seems a cross between a Broadway musical and the flying monkey theme from THE WIZARD OF OZ; a couple of lynch mobs; back-stabbing family members; a prayed for miracle flood of Biblical proportions; and a strange character who seems a lot like the devil and you're in for a toe-stomping, roller coaster ride of a movie filled with humor of all kinds.<br /><br />Many people have criticized the movie because they don't understand what's going on throughout the movie. To begin with, the film is loosely based on Homer's THE ODYSSEY. If you're familiar with that classic piece of literature, you will have a better understanding of the movie and perhaps appreciate it a bit more. But if you aren't familiar with THE ODYSSEY, it really shouldn't make too much of a difference. This is a Coen brother's film and like all of their movies it is quirky, somewhat bizarre, and full of classical and pop cultural references. The humor is on several different levels from visual gags to witty word play.<br /><br />However, not everyone will find the film enjoyable. Nevertheless, this is probably the most audience accessible of all Coen films. It's made in the same sort of style as RAISING ARIZONA and THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and has a \\"happy\\" ending. The film feels like one is watching an old silent film brought to life and connected together. Not only that, but the movie also has one of the best soundtracks in recent years; the music is a key part of the film.<br /><br />Other than that all I can say is that my brother and I are different as night and day and there aren't very many movies we both enjoy. We both loved this movie.ike one is watching an old silent film brought to life and connected together.

B00005OM4N|5.0|like all of britneys cds i can listen to the whole thing without skipping any of the songs and there arent many people with cds like that. there all good especially on this cd and for those who dont like britney buy this and listen you will see what you have been missing
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a funny movie, and short enough to stay that way. Mike Meyers's humor is obvious throughout, along with that of Eddie Murphy, who plays a real ass this time. The extra music video didn't really add anything to the experience for me, but I like the original movie enough that I'd be happy to buy this DVD without any extras. Still, as a screenwriter, I like to see all that stuff, and there's some good material included along with the feature here. My wife, who dislikes animation, likes this film. Definitely worth the price!
B00005RDAF|5.0|this is the third collection of britneys dvd movies. it has 2 videos and the full length pepsi commercial and hbo commercial.plus the makings behind crossroads. ill admit it is a short video but if you are a britney fan than you will love as do i.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is based on Homer, but it's a pretty thin Homer, and I doubt that it would work without the music. However, the Coen's in their wisdom did include some truly great music, and you'll find it all on this disk. When I was growing up the radio played a varitey of styles of music, including various country stylings. Country had its roots in the &quot;old timey&quot; music featured here, and if you think what gets played on the country stations today is authentic, you should know that this is the real, authentic American country music. A lot of it is gospel, and there's also blues, and at times you can hear something ancestral to rock and roll. The commentary included with the disk will fill you in on the details. I've been happy I got this disk since the first time I played it!
B00005QW5X|5.0|With a stunning combination of potent musical performances and a clever script, this witty, tragic, poignant film captivates it's audience and changes the world. Grippingly powerful, blazingly symbolic, and heart-warmingly comical, Hedwig teaches us all something about fame and love and self-discovery. The soundtrack is a phenomenal success, and visually this movie is a treat as well. This movie will make you question your world, it will break your heart, and it will make the gender line just a little bit blurrier. It is a cinematic triumph and an absolute must see!
B000031XCR|4.0|Yes I have to admit that I enjoy the sappiness of the Pop/Adult Contemporary artist Celine Dion.  I have three of her albums and this one includes all of her hits and then some new songs.  I would be totally Ok with the CD if it had more stuff on the hits part and not so many new songs.  She should have included &quot;All By Myself&quot; and &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now.&quot;  I also think she should have included the extended versions of &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot; and &quot;To Love You More.&quot;  But overall the album is generally good and memorable.  Starting out in the early 90s, Celine Dion took the pop world by storm with these hits.  I like every single one of the hit songs on the album,  including the most recent &quot;That's The Way It Is.&quot;  Overall if you're looking for a Celine Dion album which includes her most popular stuff with a little bit of new material then this one is for you, though I don't care much for some of the new songs (could be just me).
B00003CXPD|4.0|Billy Elliot is the story of an 11-year-old boy (Jamie Bell) brought up in a tough working class environment who attends boxing classes at the behest of his tough mining father (Gary Lewis). Unfortunately for Billy however, not only does he has to wear his grandfathers antique boxing gloves but he has no boxing talent whatsoever. Somewhat reluctantly (and secretly from his father) he is drawn into participating in the local ballet classes that take place in the same village hall. There he is taken under the wing of the teacher, Mrs Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters (Educating Rita) who soon realises that his flourishing talent may just be his ticket out of the poverty and deprivation that surround them. However, this is to the horror of his father, for not only is this dancing, it's not even the masculine dance of Gene Kelly. It is ballet, as his father would have it, only for girls and nancy boys.<br />Set in the north east of England during the British miners strike of 1984-5 Director Stephen Daldry perfectly captures the darkest period of British social history and the poverty suffering and devastation that it brought to so many communities in this extremely heartwarming and uplifting movie. The miners strike was the period in Britain's history when Margaret Thatcher (the Iron Lady as she became known) literally starved the coal miners, who were striking to save their jobs and the pits from closing. It literally turned neighbours against one another, brought enormous economic hardship to families and destroyed communities. And when it was all over they closed all the pits anyway and all hope was stolen from the working classes, perhaps never to be restored again.<br />Billy Elliot is a very good movie but I have one objection with it and all the other `gritty' British movies and that is the way the working classes are always portrayed. On the basis of Brassed Off, The Full Monty, Little Voice etc., Americans must really pity us poor British in our squalid terraced council houses and working men's clubs, cigarette permanently in one hand, beer permanently in the other, with our conversations littered with obscenities, even when speaking to kids. The reality is somewhat different and it worries me that a stereotype may begin to develop here. I, and all of my friends come from a working class background and many of the people I knew at school had fathers working in the mines. However, none of them came from a family where obscenities, cigarettes and alcohol were the norm. Certainly there is an element of society that lives like that but from my experience they tend to be the never worked, never want to work lowest of the low, who would never fight to keep a job or bring up a family. (Excuse me whilst I get off my soap box)!<br /> Ultimately however, this is a film with a lot of charm, a lot of humour, a lot of heart and great acting performances all round (but particularly from Gary Lewis, Julie Walters and the excellent newcomer Jamie Bell as the title character). The movie is full of fine moments including Billy and his teacher performing a powerhouse dance routine to I Love to Boogie by T Rex, or when Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Debbie idly bangs a stick along the row of policemen's perspex riot shields, whilst sauntering down the street and Billy's dance of rage when his father forbids him from dancing again.<br />Stephen Daldry's direction and the screenplay by Lee Hall are both excellent and it is to their credit that they deal with the question of Billy's nascent sexuality, avoiding vulgarity and judgement. Billy Elliot is not a stereotypical male ballet dancer but the question of his sexuality is left open to question and to their credit the filmmakers have avoided the obvious temptation to reassure the audience that the young boy is straight, because it is irrelevant to the triumph against the odds story. Slightly confusing however, is the use of T rex throughout the soundtrack and other obvious references to the seventies, such as the sight of a Spacehopper and the game Ker-Plunk. 1984/5 was more the time of Wham, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Duran Duran and the Spacehopper and fallen from fashion some ten years earlier (although now making a return apparently). However, any criticisms are mere details for Billy Elliot is that annual rarity, a really good British movie, that both inspires and entertains in equal volumes. Highly recommended!nties, such as the sight of a Spacehopper and the game Ker-Plunk. 1984/5 was more the time of Wham, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Duran Duran and the Spacehopper and fallen from fashion some ten years earlier (although now making a return apparently).

B000005AYM|5.0|Odd as it sounds, I really enjoy listening to this album when I'm sleepy. It lets me relax and eventually fall dead asleep.  The rhythm and music is just so soothing and relaxing.  This definatly isn't driving music if that's what you're looking for.  Though some of the songs on this album sound the same, I give Erykah Badu credit because she was truley an influence in modern day r&amp;b and soul, thus paving the way for such artists as Angie Stone and Macy Gray.  She is definatly an interesting figure in the music industry, known for her body jewlery and hair raps (I remember hearing Billy Crystal commenting at the Academy Awards on her infamous hair wrap: &quot;They finally found the last missing Oscar.  It was found under Erykah Badu's wrap.&quot; LOL)  Hit songs include &quot;On &amp; On&quot;, &quot;Appletree&quot; and one of my favorites, &quot;Certainly.&quot; Another song I also enjoy is the catchy, &quot;4 Leaf Clover&quot; as well as the &quot;Intro&quot; and &quot;Outro.&quot;  &quot;Next Lifetime&quot; I also remember hearing on the radio and is catchy as well.  So, if you're interested in modern Soul/R&amp;B that you can relax to (Whether it be at dinner or going to bed) this CD is reccomended.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|absolutely incredible.......alls I can say is that this is a beautifully great album..........im speechless
B000050XEI|3.0|On A Day Without Rain, Enya moves in some interesting musical directions. The most notable of these are Silver Inches, The First of Autumn, and the title track. Arguably, each of these instrumentals has the potential to rank with some of the great classical pieces of well-known composers like Bach and Beethoven. We also find some interesting experimentation with digitized arpeggios and pizzicato strings on One By One.<br />The rest of the album is more or less standard Enya, and the overall sound is strongly reminiscent of previous works. As a result, die-hard Enya fans will find few surprises, and may find the 35-minute disc a bit underwhelming if not disappointingly  short.<br />Enya's vocals are a mixed bag. On Deora Ar Mo Chroi, her voice seems buried in the mix. The same problem afflicts Flora's Secret and Fallen Embers. The muddiness is enough to make you wonder if Enya was resorting to her trademark technique of creating broad, fuzzy musical and vocal washes in an attempt to induce a sense of euphoria in the listener. In fact, this effect is most noticeable on Wild Child, which is as close to aural Prozac as you can get.<br />Enya redeems herself on three stand-out vocal tracks: Deora Ar Mo Chroi, Fallen Embers, and Pilgrim. All deliver that wonderfully ethereal imagery and feeling that she is so well known for. Fallen Embers reaches the pinnacle set on China Roses, which is<BR>one of the best cuts from The Memory of Trees.  <br />Deora Ar Mo Chroi prompts visions of a warm, summer's night spent gazing at the stars as you ponder the meaning of life. The overall effect is truly heavenly, and belies a profound spiritual depth that few musicians ever reach.<br />Only Time is so-so, and like its stablemate Lazy Days, appears to be a very transparent grab at a Top 40 hit. Lazy Days is the weaker of the two compositions and seems dated and lame.<br />Finally, Tempus Vernum is an intriguing experiment, but a bit jarring because it's such a departure from the rest ofthe work.<br />A Day Without Rain is a bit of a disappointment because it holds so much promise. It's nice without being as lastingly moving as her seminal Watermark and the follow-up, Shepherd<BR>Moons.<br />Sadly, Enya seems to be stuck in the rut that so many middle-aged (or near middle-aged) performers seem to fall into sooner or later. The overall impression one gets from this album is that Enya is standing at the brink of greatness.<br />A Day Without Rain makes an interesting addition to any Enya collection, but doesn't quite live up to the standards set by her earlier works. Those looking for a solid introduction to her work would profit from purchasing her first three albums.

6302453356|4.0|I first saw this film when I was a kid and I've loved it ever since. What can one really say about Robin Williams? He shines in almost every role he's ever taken. This picture is strictly for the kids and it does succeed in entertaining them, at least I think so. Spielberg's reimagining of the classic franchise does more in my opinion than any Disney or Broadway production could ever do. Williams shines as the decadent Banning who rediscovers his youth, Hoskins is hilarious as Smee, Dame Maggie Smith is heartwarming and touching as the aged Wendy Darling and who can forget the charming Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, who provides more character to that fairie than that annoying mute variation that opens up every edition of the Wonderful World of Disney can ever do.(This is not a knock on Disney because that company remains one of the greatest film studios of all time; Walt truly was a visionary for his age). If you don not enjoy this film, I guarantee your kids will.

B00000DFSK|5.0|When I heard that U2 was releasing a best of colelction from their 80s career,I figured that it would contain all of its greatest from the 80s. But there are some conspicous songs that are abseng like Gloria from October which is a great songs that I was expecting on the album. <br />However, the album is still really good because it really capture what U2 was really all about in the 1980s which was just pure energy and creativity. There really hasn't been another band like them. This album is great if you're just getting into the band and want to know more about them or have been a long time fan who does not have all of their 80s albums.
B000001EKX|5.0|On this album KISS really came up with some great songs. All 10 songs are great and i still listen to this album today after first hearing it over 20 years ago. This is a real KISS album and represents what the band is all about as far as image and songs go. Just a few highlights are GOIN' BLIND, WATCHIN' YOU, MAINLINE &amp; GOT TO CHOOSE. Essential listening.
B000001FA4|5.0|Unforgettable Fire is a classic U2 album because the band's detication to the music. They really poured their feeling and emotions into this album. The muscinship is excellent. From A Sort of Homecoming to MLK, the band plays great and Bono adds great vocals. Even all the years that have passed since its release, unforgettable fire still stand as a great album.
B000002L9B|5.0|Although I think it was a brave attempt by Prince to make a film in that style, it was panned by the critics, and by some Prince fans alike. Forget the film. The CD contains one of his all-time classics \\"Kiss\\", which even if it were released today, is streets ahead of the usual dross that you get in the charts. Apart from this gem, other highlights include \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\" \\"Do You Lie\\" \\" I Wonder You\\" and my all time favourite Prince song, and achingly sad, \\"Sometimes It Snows In April\\"<BR>Check out his new CD \\"The Rainbow Children\\" - Prince is back on track with this one.
B00004XOWM|2.0|We're Limp Bizkit!  We swear a lot!  Our former guitarist wore weird makeup!  We hate any band with more talent than us!  <BR>Aren't they cool?  Every CD Limp Bizkit makes seems to get worse.  Fred's lyrics are pretty laughable.  He spends an entire song trying to fit in as many obsenities as possible..., meanwhile insulting Trent Reznor, who has more talent than 100 clones of this band.<BR>While some of the guitar work is catchy, this album seems aimed towards 'angry' preteen crowds spoonfed on mediocre MTV fare.  As a whole, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water is about as refreshing as a flat, warm coke in the middle of a desert.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This is one of the worst so-called blockbusters I have ever seen. It fails to hold together as a whole, and its component parts fail to convince. The Affleck/Beckinsale/Hartnett love triangle left me with no sympathy for any of the characters whatsoever. In fact the only people I felt any sympathy for were the Japanese for wanting to drop lots of high explosive on them. <br />The action sequence, whilst impressive in terms of pure effects, was too confusing to leave any sense of emotion - I felt neither angry, nor sad, nor anything really, except wondering what the hell was going on. And the post-attack part of the film is instantly forgettable. <br />&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; was so much better in every way. For one thing, it brought out some real emotion as it got to grips with the key issue of the attack coming prior to the declaration of war - a fact ignored in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.  <br />I was genuinely bored watching this movie and I wish I hadn't bought it without seeing it first.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|When I went to see this movie, I was expecting a Indiana Jones type thriller but instead got a very boring and very bad movie. I watched it one more time after this to see if it was any better but it just got worse. I dont recommend seeing this.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Six Degrees is another amazing, inspiring, thought provoking, lyrically sound musician's album by Dream Theater. There are musical references from previous DT albums as well as from other great progressive bands. For me, it ties all the great DT works (SFAM, I&W, Awake, ACOS) together. Definitely five stars.  <br />I would say this album is unbelievable but I've come to expect such things from Dream Theater. I too will buy anything the band puts out, without a listen. The quality is always there--even though parts of \\"Infinity\\" were weak due to label pressures. The musicianship is always phenomenal. Each band member contributes to the writing and the lyrics aren't the same old, tired, metal, mad at the world crap!<br />If you like heavier music with excellent lyrics and mega-musicianship, you can never go wrong with DT. If I could only have one album, it would be one of their's.
B00005K9LK|5.0|So what if it's a little overproduced, Rob and the boys pound it out with more passion than can be heard currently.  Brings back memories of my long gone high school days.  God, was it that long ago....I can still hear Priest, Maiden, and Sabbath booming in my beatup Datsun.....
0553296981|5.0|An innocent's account of the greatest evil imaginable. This is the most powerful book of the century. If one didn't know her fate, one might read it as the reflections of any girl. That one does know her fate makes this as close to a holy book as the century produced. To those reviewers who gave this book anything fewer than five stars: are you completely out of your minds?
0679735909|5.0|\\"The book was thick and black and covered with dust.\\" It is not a coincidence that the first two words of this remarkable novel are, \\"the book.\\" Possession is a book about books, about the study and love of literature and the intricate obsession with the lives of literary figures shared by academics, historians, and the randomly curious public. It tells the story of a quiet literary scholar, Roland Michell, who finds a lost letter from the great Victorian poet, R.H. Ash, to another famous poet of the day, Christabel LaMotte. As he is an Ash scholar, Roland takes the letter to a LaMotte scholar named Maude Bailey, and together they begin a search to uncover the relationship between the two. It is a discovery that will have repercussions in the academic world and in their own lives. If you tend to lose yourself in second-hand bookstores, are ravenously curious about the lives of the authors whose works you read, or simply love a great romantic mystery, you will love this book, which won the Booker prize, England's highest literary award.<br />  A.S. Byatt is herself a formidable scholar of literature who left a teaching career at London College in 1983 to write full-time. One day while in the British Museum Library, she spotted a well-known Coleridge scholar. It occurred to Byatt that much of what she knew about the Romantic poet had been filtered through the mind of that scholar. She mused about the effect that such a single-minded pursuit must have on a person. \\"I thought,\\" she said, \\"it's almost like a case of demonic possession, and I wondered - has she eaten up his life or has he eaten up hers?\\" She had an idea to write a book about two famous authors and two scholars who study their lives.<br />  Byatt created two fictional poets, loosely based on Robert Browning and Christina Rosetti, named Randolph Henry Ash, and Christabel LaMotte. The marvel of the novel is that Byatt creates not just the poets, but also their poetry. Calling on her extensive knowledge of Victorian literature, she intersperses the narrative with their poetry, prose, tales, and even literary criticism about the works of these fictional characters. It is, to use an over-taxed phrase, a tour de force. The poems are beautiful in their own right. I confess that my first time through this novel I went to my Norton Anthology of English Literature and looked for R.H. Ash. I was frankly amazed that the author could switch from style to style and write such beautiful verse. The third time through the book, I was struck by the way the poetry also illuminates the narrative.<br />  Roland Michell and Maude Bailey, our two protagonists, feel most uncomfortable in a modern setting and turn to the past for answers. As they connect to the lives of the poets through their letters, they find strength within themselves to live meaningful lives. Byatt's genius for metaphor connects the two couples over and over. Notice the use of color: greens for the feminine and grays and blacks for the masculine characters. Cropper wears Ash's watch, Maude wears LaMotte's brooch. Symbols of confinement and release are paired: the glass coffin and the library cubicle, the green Beetle and the serpent Melusine, the short-lived Eden of Yorkshire and Roland's forbidden garden. As the story builds toward its climax, the images pile up, as it were, until everything and everyone meets in one place, in one very cinematic scene, to uncover the truth. Yet, even with all the romantic drama, Byatt never loses contact with books, with the fact that it is through reading and writing that human beings make contact with their finer selves.<br /><br />  Those who write biography or study history know that every life has a story, but also that we can never tell the story exactly as it was. There is no final truth in history, but only interpretation and recreation. We read the journals of our ancestors and wonder what was not said that would have been most enlightening, as we try to extract a vision of their reality from the clues left to us. Roland and Maude, after years of studying these poets, have a deeply personal regard for them and a desire to protect their privacy. When Roland discovers a correspondence between the poets, he knows that a media sensation will ensue in which every personal detail of their lives will be open to exposure. He resents this, yet is drawn by curiosity about them to investigate further, which eventually causes everything to come to light. In a highly readable series of events, Byatt takes us deeper and deeper into these lives, switching from past to present and back to the past. Finally, after all is revealed, Byatt shares one more crucial detail with the reader that is never revealed to the other characters. It is her way of letting us know at the end that the full story of any other life will always be, to some extent, a mystery.act a vision of their reality from the clues left to us.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|Prince is one of the few true musical geniuses of our time.  Yes...I think Prince gets a little caught up in his self at times but Rainbow Children happens to be one of the tightest cd's I've heard from Prince in a long time.  Rainbow is musically great.  Jazz & Funk - from prince such a beautiful mix.  I was getting fed up with Prince like most people, but give this cd a try it's so worth it.
0385335482|4.0|I really liked this book, I'm not a bridget jone's fan and couldn't get through reading a bridget jones book, so I was surprised when I found myself liking \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\", not only is it good but its fun! Its light reading and its not annoying like bridget jones.<br />I like that its original and that the author doesn't try to copy anyone like the bridget jones author did. Sophie Kinsella definitely knows how to write a good book and keep your attention. Its  basically about a girl that loves to shop, and shop she does! She shops when she can't afford to shop, she's even a financial journalist for Successful Saving. <br />I really liked the character, she was so funny and nice. Not only that but she has the opportunity to take advantage of someone in order to pay her credit  bills but in the end she does the right thing. Thank goodness. <br />I only object to some profanity that's in the book, and the fact that the book makes fun of people that abstinate from sex. Also this book teaches that debt never gets anyone anywhere.
0789723107|2.0|Anyone in the web design business who doesn't already know the basics that are in this book is in the wrong business. I'm disappointed because I thought I might learn something new about web design and usability. This is the same old ugly thing. And lets face it most web sites are pretty ugly. They usually try to look like Yahoo or something like that because the whole idea is to grab investment money. <BR>Why do Martha Stewarts magazines and books look so terrific and her website is so ugly? Why does Target do such fabulous television ads but when you go to the website it doesn't even look like the same company? <BR>I'm tired of these ugly, crowded sites complete with tiny little postage stamp pictures, vile web safe colors, and silly banner ads. I want to see something intelligent and beautiful for a change, and I know I'm not the only one. <BR>Steve Krug is obviously part of that &quot;Web Design&quot; group. Same old thing, same old people. The really talented graphics, advertising and media people are obviously not yet as involved as they should be in web design. I'm certain if they were we would be seeing more spectacular presentations. <BR>I think Steve Krug got all of his friends to write five star reviews on this book. They obviously subscribe to the same boring philosophies. Why doesn't somebody create something clever and beautiful for a change, the way they do in television and print media land? That's a book I would buy.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Killing is my business was good, but now it plainly rocks. The drums are much clearer, you can tell how good Gar was. You can understand the vocals so much better than before. The demo's I think are good bonuses, but I think the only downside to this is all those bleeps in These Boots. It ruins the song. But that aside, even if you have it allready, you need to get this new and improved version now!!!
B000002AE3|5.0|It bugs me when less-erudite music fans lump TOTO in with the other so called &quot;Arena-rock&quot; bands of the late 70's/early 80's. Sure, bands like Styx, Reo Speedwagon, and Boston have some gems in their pile; but they don't even come close to displaying the combination of soul, groove, master musicianship, and unparralled creativity of TOTO.<BR> <BR>  Tambu, Toto's 9th is a perfect example of the medling  of the above-mentioned styles. From the haunting beauty of &quot;I Will Rememeber You&quot; to the sassy R&amp;B of &quot;Baby He's Your Man&quot; (featuring the talented Jenny McCrae) to the fusion-rock style of &quot;Drag Him to The Roof&quot;; this album is probably Toto's finest moment. Other stellar tracks include &quot;The Turning Point&quot; and &quot;Time Is The Enemy&quot; which showcase the ultimate groovemaster of the keys, David Paich, and the always versatile vocals of guitar-hero (and deservedly so)  Steve Lukather; who's talent rarely gets the accolades its deserves. Luke is probably the greatest guitar player since Hendrix; and one listen to this album or  1993's  Kingdom OF Desire (TOTO, Relativity) you would be likely be hard-pressed not to agree. Tambu combines Funky R&amp;B grooves with lush soulful ballads, topped off with the pure driving force of rock 'n'roll. <br /> Tambu is somewhat of triumph for TOTO, who suffered the loss of co-founder and drummer-extradoniere Jeff Porcaro, who died suddenly in 1992. Jeff, famous for his shuffle and samba groove would be proud of this record. Tambe celebrates some of the early TOTO sound, while nicely progressing into a whole new style. If the defintion of a progressive artist or band, is to refuse to stagnant and re-package TOTO might very well be the ultimate in proressive by that definition.
078401213X|5.0|This is an incredible movie.  I had my doubts about this movie when I first sat down to watch it, but Darren Aronofsky really blew me away with this film.<br />For those of you that hate films that don't really end completely resolved, and carry a very strong message, this film is not for you.  There is a very strong message here, but a lot of people won't take the time to look for it.<br />The movie is basically about a mathematical genius, who intends to discover a cryptic number in the Bible that contains the true name of God.  According to some of my more religious friends, a lot of this stuff isn't Biblically accurate, but I could care less.  The man doesn't believe in the existence of a higher power.  Everything is based in math and tangible principles.  Meanwhile, various factions struggle to use the man's mind for their own designs.<br />This movie says a lot about the true nature of the world, and the true nature of man.  The message at the end is decidedly more positive than the one contained in Requiem for a Dream, and it still makes for powerful viewing.  See this movie at once.
B00005QJDG|5.0|This album is everything DREAM THEATER is \\"live\\". It captures the fire & precision of every band member.They each have their own \\"spotlight\\" through the course of the show.They are trully THE ultimate band! If you are a DREAM THEATER fan you won't want to miss this one.
B00005O5JV|2.0|There is only one reason to see this movie and that is Reese Witherspoon. And with her bright, comic flair even she has to dog paddle through certain points of the film just to stay afloat. <br />A living Malibu Barbie, Elle Woods is a fashion design major. That is until her boyfriend announces he's going to Harvard Law and dumps her because Elle's image doesn't fit into his future plans of a life in politics. Still in love with the superficial louse, Elle decides to get her man and applies to Harvard Law School. Her application video is quite funny in it's over the top approach. Mesmerised by her audacious tape and impressed by her more obvious talents (hair, figure) the male admissions board alots an opening to the luscious Ms. Woods. Upon arriving at Harvard Law, Elle runs into her ex-flame and is surprised by his surprise at seeing her there. \\"Like it's hard?\\" she asks incredulously. The ex's new girlfriend is prim and proper, the ideal candidate's wife. She sets out to ridicule Elle, who sticks out like a sore thumb in this Ivy League enclave. After several setbacks, a depressed Elle finally finds a friend in the local beautician. Then encouraged by a seemingly sympathetic Professor,Elle decides to make the best out of her time at Harvard Law and does so with dogged determiniation (reminiscent of her performance in ELECTION).<br />Reese does an incredible job considering the poor material she's given. While the premise is full of comic potential, it is little more than that--a premise. The story is never fully developed so her setbacks and victories are pretty much one note. I get the feeling there's actually less story in the script than is given on film by the very good cast helmed by Ms. Witherspoon. It's not a terrible film but it could have been so much better.
6305897786|5.0|I loved this movie, and the DVD was great. My only criticism of the DVD is that when they include the engravings from the book they omit the true Ninth engraving (the most important one really).  They include the Aristide Torchia version and the forgery (with the fire), but the Luciferian one with the light shining from inside the castle is not included.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Wish I have a MAD MAX 2 DVD like this!! This is a great DVD, with the 2 versions on it!! the American dubbed version is a great wild cartooned movie. And when I hear the true Australian version... the movie becomes more serious and real!! amazing. Some of my friends prefered the old dubbed version, but I prefered the 2 versions!! The Stereo sound of the engine of the yellow interceptor when Max is waiting for the knight Rider is superb. The image is the best, and this DVD have the choice to see the movie in 16:9 or in a 4:3, wish all DVDs have this option when movies are filmed in wide screen. If you like Muscle Cars crashing, runing, etc. you must see this...
B00003CX96|5.0|This is always been one of my favorite movies on many levels.  <BR>The music (Mendelsohn's Italian Symphony and Rossini's Barber of Seville Overture, as well as certain original music) fits perfectly.<BR>Even without the bicycling footage (the high point of the movie), many aspects of the story are touching.  Dave eventually abandons his Italian facade and bonds with his father.  The protagonists, called Cutters as an insult, adopt the name with pride.<br />Also, it's interesting to see actors who would later be big, such as Daniel Stern and Dennis Quaid.  In addition, Hart Bochner (Rob) would later play Ellis in Die Hard. <BR>Picture and sound quality is also really good on the DVD.<BR>If I had one complaint, it would be in the subtitles.  The transcription of the Italian arias and Italian dialogue is terrible, and would have been easy to verify. <br />But all in all the movie and the DVD are great.
B000002B7P|5.0|This is an awesome CD. The last with Randy Roads it really hits home with Diary of a Madman, Little Dolls, and Flying High Again.  Ozzy mixes the hard rock with slower eerie songs that are just great. This CD is a must have if you're an Ozzy fan. This is great. If you liked Blizzard of Ozz you'll love this.
0345440803|5.0|Thank you !!<br />I could not read this book fast enough. With my daughter Rachel fast approaching 15 months, I took all the advice in the Baby Whisperer book and turned around my then 3 month old grumpy/touchy none sleeping baby girl, into an Angel baby, sleeping through the night at 4 months. YES the one I thought I gave birth too and dreamed about.<br />And what a great read the Toddler book is.<br />If you decide to parent using Tracy's philosophy and enjoyed her Baby book you have to read the Toddler book. The advice and intuition is common sense and oh so real, information is oozing out of this book. <br />A superb blend of humor mixed with real life stories, leaves you feeling empowered with the woes of toddlerhood, I am just finding out whether or not my Angel daughter is going to continue her path, but I know she is. We have had our moments though, and now I feel so confident about the situations that do arise.<br />A more empowering book than her first, wonderfully written, I just cant seem to put it down. Husband laughs alot when I wont leave the house without it. But he did eventually read Tracy's Baby book and enjoyed it, he has not got his hands on this book yet. <br />Congratulations on such a wonderful book<br />Michale and daughter Rachel XX
B000002B7M|5.0|I absolutley love this CD. Mr. Crowley and Suicide Solution are just pure genius. He is absolutley great with the orchestra. If you liked Diary of a Madman or Down to Earth you gotta get this CD. Ozzy just keeps getting better.
0802130208|5.0|Every once in a while, a highly touted book comes along that lives up to it's reputation. All of the praise on the cover and the inside pages, the flattering forward by Walker Percy, even the Pulitzer Prize, do not go far enough in paying homage to this rambling, raucous, comic explosion of a novel.<br />The theme is summed up perfectly by the Jonathan Swift quote from which John Kennedy Toole found his title: &quot;When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.&quot;  Ignatius J. Reilly, the fleshy 30 year old anti-hero protagonist is this genius, a giant of a man who helps us to see the absurdity of our times and the foolishness of our pursuits.  In his misadventures, the highly educated but slothful Reilly propels himself through New Orleans, leaving a trail of havoc in his wake.<br />This is the only book I've ever read that had me laughing uncontrollably.  This is the kind of book that makes you miss your stop on the train.  At the same time it is very sad, as all great books are.  It is our loss that Toole committed suicide at the age of 32, before this epic tragicomedy was published and before he could add one or two more great novels to the American canon.

B00005ATZT|5.0|I saw this movie shortly after it's release in 1993 and was immediately impressed by the great way the story was written, as well as the great acting. Many big screen movies drawn from tv series fall far short of the originals - in spite of excellent actors. A great example is 'The Avengers', a terrific tv series of the 60's that fell flat on it's face on the big screen, despite the magnificent Ralph Feinnes, the comely Uma Thurman, and the unforgettable Sean Connery. Not so 'The Fugitive'! This may well be one of the greatest action/dramas I've seen, and to date remains so.<br />The cat-and-mouse chase scenes between Ford and Tommy Lee Jones will literally keep you on the edge of your seat. Ford's brooding sincerity is perfectly counterpointed by Jones' dogged intensity. Highlighted by James Newton Howard's riveting score, this movie quite literally has no dull moments.<br />One of the best features on the DVD is a scene-by-scene commentary (of the complete film) between Andrew Davis and Tommy Lee Jones. The viewer is led through each scene as it unfolds, with Davis explaining how the scene was done, as well as commenting on the various actors in each scene. Davis naturally does most of the talking, with Tommy adding a comment here and there. Through this process the viewer is led on a fascinating journey into the creative processes in the making of a great film.<br />In my opinion this is THE quintessential action/drama film of all time!
6304884419|5.0|With all the praise this movie has received, it couldn't receive enough.  I categorize myself as a \\"movie buff\\" and I'll watch one from any genre.  This movie, may I say, is extroadinarily good!  Fantastic!  The aspect that amazed me most was the casting.  People, many times, overlook the severity of this job and it was completed magically.  The acting was spectacular and very convincing.  Though Chazz Palmenteri (Sonny) and Robert De Niro (Lorenzo) did their usual breathtaking performances, one character stole the movie.  That was both the 9-year-old (Francis Capra) and 17-year-old (Lillo Brancato) versions of Calogero.  Both of them did wonderfully, calibrating their roles together to make you believe they were truly the same person.  I may be pushing the limits by saying it is the best movie ever, because it's mine, but you'll surely find it at the top of many people's lists.
0061020710|3.0|To many people, Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett are nearly synonymous.  They're both great humorists and write some terrific satire, so the comparisons between the two seem pretty inevitable.  My favorite books of all time are those in the Hitchhiker Trilogy by Douglas Adams, and after hearing so much about Pratchett and his much-praised series, Discworld, I thought I'd give it a shot.  While I can see how Adams and Pratchett are parallels in many respects, I just didn't think this book had as much charm as Adams' works.<br />As a twist of originality, the Discworld series doesn't follow one or two characters around...  It focuses more on the world, telling the tales of its inhabitants.  It's a pretty awkward change for most people, and it's quite a bold move on the part of the author, but I'm afraid it just didn't captivate me like I had hoped.  I found myself unable to connect to most of the characters...  Possibly because they weren't described well enough, possibly because they didn't express enough character to keep me excited, or maybe because Pratchett spent so much darn time talking about everything BUT the characters.<br />Pratchett's humor isn't quite what I had expected after reading -- and getting used to -- Adams' style.  Admittedly, they're both quite similar, but I've found that Pratchett uses a lot of techniques that may be more favorable to English readers, whereas I'm just a lowly American looking for a good laugh.  I got the jokes and puns he was making, but I found myself thinking they were pretty dry...  Or sometimes I would recognize him trying to throw a punchline in, but it just didn't work on me.  I was hoping Pratchett would get me to pause reading because I was laughing so much...  But in the end, I wanted to stop reading, period.<br />The book has its flaws, and I'm sorry for spending so much time dwelling on them, but it also has its better points.  The cities that are described, the locations that are visited, and the world of Discworld is all made quite clear to the reader.  It's abnormal, and usually quite silly, but Discworld really comes alive in your mind. You soon realize that there's certainly no shortage of adventures in this flat universe, and Pratchett obviously saw the same thing or he wouldn't have written 20+ about it.<br />If you can get into it, I'm sure you will enjoy this book heartily.  There's a lot to love about it, but unfortunately, most of it didn't appeal to me.  The book didn't quite attach itself to me like I had hoped it would, but I'm not letting Pratchett off the hook just yet.  I'm currently in the middle of Good Omens, another of his books, and I'm really enjoying it.  I also plan on reading another Discworld book in the near future, probably number eight.  Here's hoping that Mr. Pratchett can make me eat my words.ld is all made quite clear to the reader.  It's abnormal, and usually quite silly, but Discworld really comes alive in your mind.

The book didn't quite attach itself to me like I had hoped it would, but I'm not letting Pratchett off the hook just yet.  I'm currently in the middle of Good Omens, another of his books, and I'm really enjoying it.  I also plan on reading another Discworld book in the near future, probably number eight.  Here's hoping that Mr. Pratchett can make me eat my words.
B00005RYQO|3.0|The only intelligent thing about this movie is the camera work, which is quite original in small moments. The rest of it is the equivalent of a Saturday morning cartoon. Very formulaic. The first MOMENT I saw one good-guy character I thought, \\"He'll be killed.\\" And I was right. And this was a good hour before he was killed! That's how formulaic this movie is! But formulas are formulas because they DO press certain buttons, and this movie presses a lot of them effectively. Paul Walker gives a good, terse Steve McQueen type performance. Vin Diesel is amusing because he's one of those ugly guys who thinks he's super-handsome! What the heck, better he think that than not. Dumb but entertaining. And I do love looking at skinny girls in tight leather jeans, with their bellies exposed--which this movie had--so liked THAT, too!
0312932081|5.0|I've read thousands of books... and this is definitely in the top 10.  It was so incredible that I devoured it within hours of getting it (even though I had a paper due the next day).  I completely identified with Ender as a brilliant, isolated child.  The things he goes through are not only exciting to read about, they make you think.  Somehow Card has hit upon human truths that people normally don't realize.<br />I was also very happy that someone has finally understood how intelligent children are.  Adults seem to think that kids are quite innocent and ignorant, whereas they have many of the same problems and emotions, and often feel things even more strongly.<br />I am rendered speechless by how wonderful this book was.  I will just say that it could change your life.  You'll be so glad you bought it.<br />[Warning: the next 3 books in the Ender series are very unlike this one.  They're more about ethical dilemmas than action.]
0743216458|5.0|I think it would be insulting for anyone to give this book less than a 5 star rating..........
B00005JKQX|5.0|Great, Wonderfull, real life. Russel another Oscar nomination, if not well a great mistake. The history is simple but complex, powerfull. In a few words, The best. Fight with all of you to win a place in the world. No more.
B00000DD1S|3.0|That's always the question when a song starts.<BR>And the answer comes soon, as always with Albert Ayler.<BR>In short : good, but not as well inspired as in Witches & Devils.
0385335482|5.0|If you liked Bridget Jones's Diary, you will love this book!
0448060191|2.0|I am genuinely baffled by the degree of devotion this book still inspires based on the reviews at this site.  I remember trying this book as a girl and disliking it; I gave it another try now on vacation, at the age of 47.  I still dislike it.  The characters are caricatures and speak in stilted dialogue unlike that of any real people--much less interesting people.  Don't misunderstand--I like good nineteenth century novels.  In fact, I love Dickens, Trollope, the Brontes, George Eliot, Mrs. Gaskell, etc.  This book is a pale imitation of those--a mere period piece.
0783113145|2.0|I thought the script and most of the acting was pretty good. But that teenager(&quot;C&quot;) can not act at all. Where did they get this guy?<br />He ruined the whole movie for me. Worth watching though...
020530902X|5.0|This slim volume is the best writing guide out there for any scribe. Middle school kids doing homework or professional writers completing their umpteenth book will find answers to their problems in this easy-to-read book.  I read S&amp;W cover to cover at least once a year as a refresher. It's never far from reach when I'm working.
B000002KZA|3.0|This album is both cohesive and completely scattered.  On one side, it flows pretty well, on the other, the difference between loving and hating the songs is harder to define.  When I was in High School, we called Pipeline the ping pong ball song.  I couldn't stand Pipeline when I first listened to the album, but there are times that the song fits a mood.  The popular success of Everything Counts led me to purchase this album, on top of owning People are People, Speak and Spell and A Broken Frame.  Two minute warning, Shame, The Landscape is Changing, Love in Itself, Told You So...all solid DMode songs.  This album is for true fans of Depeche Mode, though.  If you aren't down with tunes like Monument, If You Want or Tora Tora Tora, then it probably isn't for you.  On the whole, I think it is more solid than pretty much everything that came after Violator, although millions of Top 40 listeners out there are probably questioning my musical taste...but I don't really care.  This album is one of their more mature works, IMHO.
B00000IBRX|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first  released and I rented it on video...then watched it on the sci-fi channel.......I am not a critic of movies but this movie to me has a message that you have to look deep into your own beliefs about your perpective on death and love.....all I can say is I hope death is like the movie and I hope that I have love in my life that will be reflected in the afterlife......I think the actors were all great and the colors were wonderful.....I loved the dog being part of the afterlife scenerio......the end was predicable but at least there was an end whereas most movies now a days don't have one......final opinion is I cried every time I viewed this film and felt good after watching it.......it's a good fantasy......I LOVED IT...no two people will walk away from it with the same opinion......
0812550757|4.0|This story is what was in Card's mind when he wrote Ender's Game.  The premise of the book is that 3000 into the future, due to relativism of time travel, Ender Wiggin is faced to finally redeem is xenocide of the Formics.  While in his thirty years of life he has become a humanist and a philosopher, he is still at heart untouched by  plain real life.<BR>The opportunity arises when in his trip he goes to a service a human colony in the planet Lusitania.  A planet where the only other race of intelligent beings exist.  The piggies, who are feared and kept untouched by humans, in order to keep them under control.  <br />Ender has to change the events so understanding become possible and in the near future , also the Buggers can come back to life in what is planned to be a parallel to paradise, where the most different intelligent  beings can coexist peacefully.<br />The story has a four stars for originality, and is above all a metaphor that has the moral of understanding and acceptance, open mindedness and love.  It's really about breaking paradigms.  <br />In the other hand, we go along with Ender, who is given now the chance to help and finally have a family, to earn love and heal scars of people who also was abused and suffered just like him, to become a protector and a knight in shinning armor.  He find relief to his conscience which was loaded all the time with a guilt that should have been other's.     <br />The  universe created by the book is rich, the plots very well taken care of and varied.  And to top it there is a tragic romantic interest for Ender which really appealed that part of me.  <br />Worth reading.
0312954468|5.0|If you don't mind a little blood and gore, you should definitely read this book.<br />Wilbur Smith brings these characters to life, you will not only root for these people, you actually might loose some sleep over them. My husband and I equally enjoyed this book and I `m usually not much for war and torture, but it is part of ancient times and it definitely creates the characters and the story in this book. <br />The slave boy Taita who is a faithful servant to Lostris who is in love with the warrior Tanus tells the story. Sounds just like the usual love story, but you are in for a big surprise. This book will take you back to ancient Egypt and you will actually feel like you are there with them fighting the same battles.<br />Read it, it is a fantastic book!
B00005OM4N|5.0|Man i know that Britneys first album was good but could have been better. Yet i think with her second album oOps i did it again really showed how talented she is. Although \\"Britney\\" shows everyone she still has it and can go even farther. All the songs are tight but \\"Boys\\" has to grow on you other other than that this CD is well warth the price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005QK3B|5.0|This is the first Marillion album I ever listened to.  I borrowed a copy from a friend many years ago, shortly after its release.  It captivated me since the moment I laid eyes on the beautiful cover and started listening to its first notes.  It's mysterious, beautiful, poetic and magic.  It features perfect executions by extremely talented musicians and one of the best conceptual themes ever.  It's unique.  It's simply one of the best albums ever recorded in music history.  As I continue to explore the amazing world of progressive music, Misplaced Childhood endures as one of the most influential albums of my life.<BR>This new edition of Misplaced Childhood is an essential buy for any serious Marillion fan.  The demos featured on the 2nd disc will give you a great insight in the magic process of creating beautiful music.  You can almost see the band working on the studio as you listen to the songs in their raw format, before they were finalized.<BR>I sincerely hope more editions such as this one continue to be released.  Years after the original band separated, listening to their previously unreleased material is almost as amazing as listening to Misplaced Childhood for the very first time.
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles outdid himself with his decision to release [[ASIN:B00003XAQ5 Kind Of Blue]] and this album in succession. The concepts of both of these were great innovations of our century. With \\"Sketches Of Spain\\", the sounds of flamenco and of Joaquin Rodrigo's wonderful \\"Concierto De Aranjuez\\" among others, Miles showed the potential of the finely arranged orchestra accompanying one of the greatest improvisors of our time. Miles' phrasing alongside Gil Evans' poignant arrangements make this a must-have album for all music lovers.
B000001EXB|4.0|Elton John's 1997 album, The Big Picture, reflects upon new beginnings with peace, love &amp; understanding. The songs on the album continue the storytelling of Elton's triumphs and shallow waters.<br />Upon The Big Picture release, Elton John lost two of his closest friends, Versace and Princess Diana. Mostly, this album was dedicated to Gianni Versace. Songs like Something About The Way You Look Tonight &amp; January, reflect new meanings all around life. Others like Long Way From Happiness, and If The River Can Bend, are the memorials of loved ones that say you really care about them.<br />Although the album isn't as good as his other 1990's albums, I still recommend this album for the unique blend of rock n' roll Elton John comes up with.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Rented the movie, fell in love with the music.<br />The track, &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; is one of the best song I've heard in way too long.  &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby&quot; extremely haunting.<br />If you are sitting on the fnce about buying this CD, jump off and do it!  The first day I had it, I played it twice all the way thru.  Now I listen to it at least once a week.  I never tire of it.  I bought a copy of it for my mother for Christmas, as she was raised on a dirt farm in the Appalachian mountains.  She is addicted now.<br />Buy it...  You will never regret it.
0783226004|5.0|For those who love spy/hacker movies, this is one to collect.  I've watched this movie about 30 times and never got tired of it.  It has intrigue, comedy, romance (well sort of anyways) and a great cast.  Played this on my home theatre entertainment and it sound great!  I also liked that the movie was situated in the beautiful Bay Area (which is where I live).
0553801481|5.0|I loved this book in more ways then one. I was very angry with the \\"Assassins Quest\\" with the uncompletedness of the ending. I meen with Kettles predictions of Fritz finding a new love and many other things that she tells him... I hope this trilogy for once will indeed have a happy ending, instead of the same sad depressing endings that the Farseer trilogy has. <BR>I meen their are still alot of things that need to be concluded if the Author is going to complete this series once and for all. For one does he ever get to meet Nettle, etc... What about the Fool? At first I thought he was a she then I thought she was a he but now I am starting to think of him as an it that can change shape. Who does Frizt fall in love with??? I believe these questions will be answered in the next book.... I hope!<BR>Oh on a second note I didn't even think this that Frizt's world and the Ship Traders trilogy had anything to do with each other intill I compared the two! That was diffently a surprise.<BR>I hope the next book is longer then \\"Fools Errand\\" and have alot more going on. Never the less I think the Tawny Man trilogy will be better and have a happier conclusion than the Farseer trilogy despite the some what sad ending of \\"Fools Errand.\\"
0571202284|5.0|Some earlier reviewer wished there was a book similar to this for 3D animation.  Well, there is: \\"The Animator's Survival Kit\\".  To be a great 3D animator, I think its essential to learn the mechanics from traditional 2D animation and Williams' book has it all.  Want to know why Pixar's animation looks great? Because the major forces behind the likes of \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Monsters Inc.\\" have 2D traditional knowledge that are so eloquently illustrated in the \\"Survival Kit\\".  This book has tons of great drawings to boot. A beautifull and informative book.  I am a proffessional animation artist, and reading this book reaffirms my notion of animation as a great enduring art form.
0767835255|4.0|No one can play a role like this but Harrison Ford. Just another great move in a long line of work!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I was more than pleasantly surprised by this one.  I had heard it was a comedy, so it was bought, with not too much in the way of expectations by any member of our family.  If you will recall, it didn't do very well at the Box Office.<br />From beginning to end, this movie was great.  My 17 yr old son even enjoyed it.<br />Between George Clooney's hair and Holly Hunter's &quot;He's bonafide.&quot;, much in the tradition of Fargo, this is a hilarious movie.  Especially enjoyable was looking for the references to The Odyssey, which my son had just studied in school.<br />The music was incorporated extremely well and I have since bought the CD just to enjoy the music that is in this movie.<br />Great for the entire family.  My 7 year old son watches it at least once a week.
B00005R87Q|1.0|If you like a movie watching a bunch of 2 grade mentality actor roles with a poorly written script this is for you.  The Tractor Trailer heist are unbelieveable, like if some trucker is going to let some guy travel across a cable onto his truck doing 70 mph.  Hey dude were are the breaks (dah).   Then there is the idiot cop that anounces that he is one then does not make a call to the Hiway protrol cars to bust the guy.  Only because he wants something from the lead hotrodder/gangster girl friend/sister? and never does. ...
0452282152|3.0|I thought the author could have researched the period a little more.  I felt that Greit could have just as easily lived in the early days of America from the few details given of &quot;Delft&quot; life.  Other than Vermeer and Greit making eyes at each other, I didn't see the attraction between them and by the end I really didn't care much what happened to either.
B0000507QH|1.0|the title of the reveiw is all that needs to be said!
B000002UAU|5.0|This is the greatest. They say it represents 60s culture but I think it's above and beyond that. I was born in the 1980s have no interest in the rest of 1960s culture but this, this is TIMELESS. &quot; Day in the Life&quot; is a fine fine piece of work!<br />If you don't have one get one! It's the greatest medicine for any bad day.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Probably one of the most annoying things that people tend to bring out in their statements about Radiohead is how often they completely glorify OK Computer, yet totally disregard the later efforts and recent works, such as Kid A and Amnesiac. As a fan of Radiohead who's loved just about everything the band has churned out (not all of it, but most of it), I can attest that yes OK Computer is a good album, one of the greatest in fact.<BR>However, the height that many people bring it to is sometimes sickening, as I hear some mentioning that it practically classifies itself as a spiritual movement and not a musical effort. Although it isn't quite that, I do believe that it is perhaps one of the best rock albums of all time. Don't think for a second though that it's the most influential rock album of the 90's, not a chance in hell it stands as that.<br />But before we delve into the crazy world brought about by Radiohead in their computerized and synthesized mixing, let us briefly touch ground as to what made OK Computer so truly defining of its time and so openly received at that. <BR>Originally, Radiohead wasn't exactly what one would describe as an innovative band, far from it in fact. The first album put out by the group from Oxford England was in fact nothing but a drudgery of alternative rock and grunge rifts, which hits the ear nicely. But otherwise it wasn't truly breakthrough, unique or innovative. <BR>Their second work, The Bends, was closer to the style of music given in OK Computer then the first album, but like Pablo Honey, The Bends often fell into a tired and true form of rock music that was pleasing to listen to but never truly different.<BR>Keeping those thoughts of this fan in mind, you can come to OK Computer and appreciate the album for what it is, not a spiritual movement, not an orgasmic undertaking, but a unique and defining piece of art for the group of British rockers.<BR>Commonly you can look at a band, a truly good band mind you, and understandtheir style and describe it in a simple few words. U2 can be described as uplifting, happy and timeless. R.E.M. can be described as moving, sharp and poppy. After OK Computer hit the streets, Radiohead could be described as abstract, dark and thoroughly epic.<br />One of the most amazing aspects of the album is that in listening to it you don't feel as if you're going through the motions of a CD with one song coming up after the next. Rather you feel as if you're transported to a strange and unique world to watch a series of failures and technological rifts unfold in the guise of loveable characters. <BR>Starting right out the first song \\"Airbag\\" delves right into the band's transformed song-writing immediately, not even bothering to humor the listener with a bridge into the style of old that the band formerly lurked around. <BR>Kicking it off with a guitar rift that is astounding to listen to and a bass intersection that becomes the beat of the song, \\"Airbag\\" stands out as one of the greatest songs that Radiohead has ever made. The drums crash and ping into the rhythms of the guitars and bass, and at the climax all other sounds break off leaving only the bass and guitar to face off in a contest of making the strangest sounds out of sheer playing.<br />Continuing on with the second song we come to what is the masterpiece of Radiohead's definitive career in my humble opinion, and if you take this album for a whirl you'll probably agree. I am of course talking of \\"Paranoid Android\\".<BR> In the first half of the dark track every odd sound that could be imagined comes into play, from sambas and maracas to computerized background vocals. Foreboding lyrics such as \\"Ambition makes you look very ugly\\" and \\"When I am king you'll be the first against the wall\\" litter the entire track, and it inspires thought and provokes startling images not yet found in other music I've heard. And then in the middle of this grand, majestic, devious song the band explodes in a barrage of anger and aggression. Fast guitar rifts and tumbling drums utterly come out of nowhere and sweep the listener away.<BR>The song goes on for quite a long time, almost 7 minutes in fact, but it feels like seconds, and you'll probably end up listing to it over and over again.<br />Yet, make no mistake; \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Airbag\\" aren't the only two tracks that make OK Computer such a fun album to listen to, far from it in fact. The rest of the CD is a wonderful ride through the abnormal world of computers and technology and society's grip with these science fiction elements. <BR>Subterranean Homesick Alien is a bizarre and very quirky song with echoing guitar rifts and odd keyboard playing that makes this song tend to stand more on the lighter side for the entire CD. <BR>\\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\" is a deeply moving slow and acoustic track that finishes off with an electronic guitar that seems to glow with self-contempt and anger. <BR>\\"Let Down\\" is a medium paced and pleasant song that has superb lyrics and ingenious use of keyboards. \\"Karma Police\\" is sheer genius, a musical masterpiece of our time that is delightfully mischievous and ultimately about revenge. <BR>\\"Fitter Happier\\" is a computerized voice and assortment of electronic sounds coming together in narrative that speaks of the perfect era of life and the lack of imperfection that comes with it. Truly it is the social core of OK Computer that speaks of the flaws that come with government control over humanity. The rest of the tracks are in their own rights, amazing, and probably some of the best songs I've heard in my entire life, or will ever hear for that matter. They don't quite stand out like the first portion of the CD, but that doesn't make them any less great, just not recognized.<br />Really when you come down to OK Computer, you are looking at a CD that has perfect music and perfect vocals, you really can't cut it any other way. But as it stands, OK Computer never really struck me as an album that would stand out as a defining point in the period of our music that would shape and innovate the way other artists preformed their own music. Quite simply, it's just too damn daring, too sharp for others to pick up successfully. If you look at current bands that get played on MTV, you'll probably shake your head in agreement. <BR>But that necessarily isn't a bad thing at all, quite a good thing in fact from my take. OK Computer was an astounding period in the life of Radiohead because it brought the band away from the carbon copy rock and roll that it had a tendency to slip into with the past albums. With the electronic keyboarding and computerized voices it stands out as the album that heralded the era of Kid A and Amnesiac. With this piece Radiohead created what they were, and nobody has had the guts to take that away from them or dispute that they've a clear style of their own that stands apart from the rest.<BR>If you're looking for good music to listen to, keeping in mind that this isn't an uplifting work and also feeling that you want to get into something more unique and personal, then OK Computer is the way to go. <BR>But for most fans of mainstream rock and roll, you may find that Radiohead is a bit too daring for your tastes, a little too quirky and symbolically heavy to listen to as opposed to lighthearted and catchy driving tunes.
B0000214F0|3.0|I saw this movie a few years ago, whenever it was released on DVD. I had seen the ad in Penthouse, but anyways....this movie is quite disturbing. There are scenes of incest, a man being cut open while wine is being poured down his throat, a scene of someone being anally penetrated by Caligula's fist, etc. etc. There are a few interesting scenes with orgies and a lesbian scene with at least one of the women being one of the Penthouse pets of the late 70's-early 80's. This movie is very lavish, the sets are enormous, the acting is alright I suppose. I honestly cannot remember much of the movie: it was very very long, and I just basically watched to see what all would happen. Malcolm McDowell, a fine actor, best known for \\"Clockwork Orange\\" plays Caligula, and he does a great job as a psycho Roman fellow. Peter O'Toole plays a fairly small role as his predecessor Emperor uncle, and is very cruel towards practically everyone. It's amazing to see Caligula go from a fairly normal guy, you know, who has sex w/ his sister and all of that sort of thing (sarcasm!), to a completely deranged lunatic. However, the movie is just wayyyyy too long. Unless your'e a fairly reserved person who dislikes seeing pornographic materials and extreme violence, i'd say go for the unrated version. Is it worth buying? Hmmm....I don't know, it's a very twisted movie, and more than likely you'll have images of the more disturbing scenes in your head for a long time, but I like to be shocked every now and then. Worth AT least a rental.<BR>   Oh yeah, the DVD transfer is fairly good, kind of dark as I recall, and the documentary was very well made, if a little lengthy, yet the color is kind of dull. I don't recall their being any other special features, other than a flashy menu and a list of other movies the actors have been in. Anyways, if you have a DVD player and want to see something different, look into this movie. Historically accurate.
0060245867|5.0|A friend of mine has talked me into reading to her kindergarten class later this week.  this past wekend I asked my 16year old daughter to pick out a couple of titles for my gig, and the first book of the shelf (she still has 50-60 of her old favorites in her room) was If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.<br />The story is delightful and the illustrations are wonderful.  While waiting for dinner to be served Sunday night my daughter picked the book up and read it--and chuckled throughout.<br />I guarantee you this will be one of your child's--and you own--all time favorites!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I consider myself a movie fan, not a buff or an expert.  Some of my favorite movies are Tootsie, Casablanca, Broadcast News, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Say Anything.  So you can tell that I'm not a cult movie freak (I like Chasing Amy, Fletch, Slapshot, etc.) or a classics junkie (Citizen Kane and Gone with the Wind are overrated.), but a true believer in good cinema.  That being said, I'm a Cameron Crowe fan.  You know where I place  Say Anything.  I loved the cast of Singles and thought it was hilarious (Xavier McDaniel's line is my favorite.).  I saw Jerry Maguire with my wife at the movies when we were dating and I don't think I've ever left the theater feeling better.  Almost Famous, however, didn't quite measure up to my expectations.  It seemed too choppy, the characters underdeveloped, and when it was over, I didn't feel like I wanted to hang out with the people I'd just spent about 90 minutes getting to know.  But I'd heard good things about the fresh cut on the Untitled DVD, that it was the version CC wanted us to see, but the studio wouldn't let him release it.  Something about a 2 hour and 45 minute comedy being too long.  Anyway, I bought the disc and let me say that it is his best work.  Right up there with Say Anything. The extra 45 minutes add the chocolate chips to the bland cookie that was Almost Famous.  Now you will feel as if you are on tour with the band,  why William feels like his school hates him, and how much he cares about Penny Lane.  See this version.  Then watch it again while listening to the hilarious mother/son commentary by Cameron Crowe and his MOTHER.  If you're like me, you were disappointed in Almost Famous after Jerry Maguire.  Give Untitled a chance and you won't be.
6300215881|5.0|Im 60 and have seen many films. This is my favorite. Not because of the plot..its ok, but the cast is the best. Brando is my all time favorite. Malden can hold his own with anyone in this type of picture, and the rest, but Ben Johnson is the standout for me. When he blanches in the cabin on the ocean when Brando throws the table. Its one of the best scenes in any movie I,ve ever seen. I saw the movie when it first came out..bought the VHS a few years ago and keep it in the safe. I watch it once a year weather I need to or not.
B00003CX96|5.0|It's about time they released this Masterpiece on DVD. In 1979, I was a 19 year old boy. My MAMA had just come home crying from the movie theatre, having seen this FILM. She said to me, \\"I just saw a movie you have to see. It made me weep because it reminded me of you.\\" Then she hugged me and I thought, God, I gotta see this movie! Then I did, and it had the exact same effect on me, and still does to this day.<br /> This is not just a \\"feel-good-coming-of-age\\" story. This FILM is a profound and intelligent comedy of an inner search for an identity. What self-aware human being hasn't confronted the blinding journey of the Self? Should I go to college and major in Business? Or should I become an Italian and race bicycles? Heck, I'm in my forties and sometimes I still don't know who I am.<br />PAPA (WORRYING ABOUT DAVE)-played hilariously by Paul Dooley.<br />\\"He's gonna be a bum, Evelyn... An Italian bum.\\"<br /> Everyone in this FILM is searching. Except for maybe Moocher. Socrates would have loved this movie.<br /><br />MAMA (WAXING PHILOSOPHICAL)-played brilliantly by Barbara Barrie.<br /> \\"I think you should come home singing... with a trophy. Do all those things while you can.\\"<br /> Everytime I see this FILM, the tears well because I knew every single one of these guys growing up and I always fell in love with the girl I couldn't have.<br /><br />DAVE (IN THE PANGS OF AMORE)-impeccably played by Dennis Christopher.<br />\\"I have such a pain in my heart, mama. I'm in love.\\"<br /> THE WHOLE CAST AND CREATIVE TEAM ARE AMAZING. AND I HOPE THEY ALL READ THIS.<br /> DENNIS CHRISTOPHER!! BELLISSIMA!! BELLISSIMA!!<br /><br /> I have a great sentiment for this FILM and as soon as I get my copy I'm heading straight to MAMA's house to watch it with her. This FILM is to AMERICAN CINEMA, as THE BEACHBOYS are to AMERICAN ROCK AND ROLL. Good vibrations, bambina!!<br /> CIAO PAPA!!
6305508550|5.0|This money is hilarious. This is an ideal movie for anyone who lacks motivation and doesn't care whether you are someone like Peter Gibbons or just anotehr apathetic teenager, anyone can relate to this.  It satirizes those annoying bosses who keep on repating themselves and always are carrying their coffee mugs not doing anything but surveying their employees.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This was a great movie.  It is George Clooney's best performance.<BR>It was unique.  It was crazy, quirky and just plain fun.  I highly recommend this movie.  The music was great too, but I was<BR>disappointed to find out that George Clooney did not actually do<BR>the singing for his character.  Everyone's performance was really very good.
B00005V0X5|5.0|A great album with great songs. Skull Beneath the Skin, rattlehead, and chosen ones are all Megadeth classics. Looking Down The Cross may just be the best Megadeth song ever. The new re- master is so much better than the original. Dave vocals are great Gars drums are mind blowing, the guitars are as good and ever, and Davids bass rocks.I don't care what other people think Killing Is My Buisness is a great album and will remain one of my favorite albums of all time. Buy it today Megadeth rules the world.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is a demonstration of what everyband should do...Progress.  For Radiohead to have done another OK Computer would have been redundant, and just Un-Radiohead.  A comparitively abstract work, this music covers almost every general facet of human emotion.  Kid A flows extremely well, from the latent complacence of &quot;Everything in it's Right Place&quot; to the fearful &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; to the dark optimism of &quot;Optimistic&quot;, the frantic desperation of &quot;Idioteque&quot;, and the climactic reprieve of &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;.  This is Radiohead's finest work, and we can only guess they'll top it, just not with Amnesiac.
6305508550|5.0|This money is hilarious. This is an ideal movie for anyone who lacks motivation and doesn't care whether you are someone like Peter Gibbons or just anotehr apathetic teenager, anyone can relate to this.  It satirizes those annoying bosses who keep on repating themselves and always are carrying their coffee mugs not doing anything but surveying their employees.
B00005ARDC|5.0|yeah yeah,<BR>so it reminds the listener<BR>of that beautiful noisy guitar<BR>of ride, or mbv maybe.<br />but it's closer to pure pop underneath--<BR>much more like music <BR>of Spacemen3 (and maybe a bit of Spiritualized,<BR>but not too much)<BR>than anything of Jesus and Mary Chain<BR>after Psychocandy.<BR>(why does no one compare this band to Love and Rockets,<BR>circa Express? am i the only one who sees that?) <BR>so yeah, while the comparisons to JMC are easy,<BR>BRMC gets more right than that.<BR>their music clearly more subtle,<BR>more sophisticated<BR>and musically tighter and more trained than JMC.<BR>it's not hte same song over and over again.<BR>they aren't as hyped or dull as the Stooges<BR>or others. <br />they have range.<BR>they have beauty.<BR>they can do the noisescapes and layers of guitar.<BR>but more, they rock.<BR>At their core,<BR>they are<BR>a Real rock n roll band.<BR>and what's better than that?<BR>(nothing.)
B00005LB9O|5.0|Had never even heard of Travis before this past Christmas, as the station we listen to never plays their songs. &quot;Side&quot; was getting good airplay on a Chicago adult-contemporary station at Christmas  and I immediately LOVED the song! It sounded so different from the garbage our hometown station plays. Got &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; CD as a birthday present recently and absolutely love it. I must admit, my knowledge of Brit pop is very limited, and I haven't heard &quot;The Man Who&quot;, but I sure know I love just about all the songs on  TIB. &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; &quot;The Cage&quot;, and &quot;The Last Train&quot; have such haunting sounds to them; the instrumentation and Fran Healy's emotive singing are superb. His phrasing is extremely effective; he comes across as a vocal genius! Yes, the lyrics can be simplistic at times, but the way they're delivered packs quite a punch. I prefer these songs to the more upbeat &quot;Sing&quot; and &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot;.I know I'm dating myself here, but some of the synthesizer sounds reminded me of Alan Parson's &quot;I Robot&quot; when it came out over 20 years ago. Not that that's a bad thing, for I loved that album when it came out too. If you're in the mood to hear something different from the run-of-the-mill pop sounds out there, try this CD!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Incredible dramedy of dysfunctional suburban America is very real and totally realized. Lester and Caroline Burnham have marital problems, their daughter wants breast implants, her empty and superficial best friend has the hots for Caroline's dad, the clean cut yuppie gay couple are happy all the while the new kid next door is filming.<BR>     I have given you the run down, but you have to see it for yourself because it is the complexity of the characters that make film score on all levels. Music soundtrack is kickin too.
B000003TA4|5.0|There are some things that get 5 stars and then there are a couple of special things in the whole world that are practically transcendental and you want to give a million stars. Kurt Kobain IS the end of the twentieth century. No real movement in music has come after him yet. He writes music that is instantly and lastingly appealing, and exposes the soul of a generation.<br />I've only seen two types of possible complaint about this album:<br />From classically trained musicians who don't think this is music. (And funny that nobody but classically trained musicians think what THEY play is music.)<br />And Nirvana purists recommending the other albums.<br />Can't go wrong. You don't need a review anyway, listen to the songs and if you don't like... well, you'll like.<br />Besides, nothing else is going on in music. Might as well stick to what will really move you, instead of spending your cash on throwaways. Don't be a poser in these empty times, be your own person and get good music.
B00005O5CM|3.0|This movie is just ok. It is very corny, very pink, and very predictable. In fact, this film is almost entirely lacking in substance. Legally Blond was entertaining though, but in an EXTREMELY shallow way. When I was putting the movie back in the case, I thought to myself, &quot;Hmmm, I think I just wasted two hours of my life...&quot; but I didn't care because the movie made me laugh in a couple of scenes. <br />It is very high-school oriented, and would probably make a great gift for a 15 year old.  However, if you are over 25, I'd skip it all together.
B000055QHO|5.0|I hear many kinds music in my life, but Day without rain Enya is different song. That's song make me always happy, fully hope the live is verry nice in peace. I go to my office and back home with this song. It's real.
B00005ASIL|3.0|Jethro Tull will soon be celebrating its 35th anniversary. At this point most listeners either love or hate the band. I once was a Jethro Tull fanatic--- attending back-to-back concerts, listening exclusively to thier music, etc.--- so, it's kind of hard to write an objective review. I'm not the biggest Tull fan anymore. Indeed, I went through a time where I mocked them. I've made my peace, though, and can stand back and recognize that some of what they did was brilliant, some silly, and some both. <br />That said, this collection is really an odd, cobbled-together lot. It starts predictably with the earlier AOR hits like &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;, etc. and throws in an odd sampling of (sometimes brutally edited) album tracks. It's packed to the brim with music at nearly 80 minutes! However, the problem is that there seems to be no sense to this collection. It's only reccomendable because it's the only Tull collection in print. They should have either put together a purely &quot;singles&quot; collection, or more carefuly selected alum tracks... for instance, there is almost NOTHING from the late 70's, an era which many Tull fans love best. &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, Tull's greatest work, is not represented at all. &quot;Skating Away&quot; easily Tull's best &quot;single&quot; is absent, in favor of the lesser &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot;... &quot;Heavy Horse&quot;, once a majestic, multi-part mini-epic got a hatchet job and now is an ordinary (but still gorgeous) 3-minute pop song. TWO tracks from &quot;Broadsword and The Beast&quot; appear, but NOTHING from &quot;A&quot;. Why??<br /> I feel this collection tries to smooth away the idiosyncratic nature of Tull, which is exactly what people loved about them in the first place. It is devoid of the fascinating album tracks that earned Tull legions of fanatical fans. For casual fans and the uninitiated, it's good listening. All kidding aside, few things in the history of popular music canmatch the energy when Anderson's wild, lyrical flute clashes and weaves with Barre's angular, precise guitar playing. There are some moments in Tull's recorded history that can easily match that of any &quot;classic rock&quot; band. Like them or not, no one ever sounded like them. They were and continue to be true originals. The same goes for Anderson's lyrics-- they are strange, anacrhronistic and occasionally Elizebethan-sounding, but unique and sometimes incredibly touching and beautiful. For many, Tull has become an object of mockery, but<BR>if you go back and listen with open ears and without cynicism, you might hear the magic they undoubtedly created and be overwhelmed by it. I'm just not sure that this is the collection that best captures that magic.<br />The sound is not, as some reviewers would have you believe, a totally lost cause. I think the midrange is generally nicely done, but the life is ucked out of the mid-bass on down and there is alot of &quot;air&quot; missing at the top. Anyway, it's no worse than the original CD issues, but probably not better than the original vinyl either. Tull never were an audiophile-friendly band anyway.
B000003NA4|5.0|This is my first Diana Krall CD and it was quite a find.  I picked it up on my way out of the store, just on a whim.  I'm very glad I did.  The Latin-based tracks are rhythmically soothing and her voice is amazing.  Her treatment of some old standards is wonderful.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00005JKT8|5.0|This was an absolutely wonderful movie. For those of us who long for love to to come along on a white horse, this is the movie for true hearts. A man out of time with never feeling loved, and a business women who constantly gets burned, love is just a century away for both. For the women of the world who long for a true gentleman, Hugh Jackman proves he is that. His mannerisms, his elegant taste in clothes and notablity of how to truly treat a woman is superb. Of course for the present business woman, who either doesn't have time for a relationship or who can never find the right man, these two characters prove that anything is possible, whether it be time, fate, or pure destiny. This movie has it all. Now I just wish I could find my true Prince on a white horse...
0679601686|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a great classic and should be read by anyone who enjoys Victorian Romance. The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy. Their tumultuous romance is extremely humorous and delightful to read.<br />Although Jane Austen was a talented novelist, she was harshly criticized during her day for writing about marriage and the social life of well-bred, 19th century British women as opposed to more serious topics such as the French and American revolutionary wars. I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.<br />Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago.  In fact, You may notice that this story is very influential in modern films and books, most recently in Bridget Jones's Diary. I recommend it highly!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I recently rented this DVD, thinking I would probably watch it for 10 minutes and think it was ... then turn it off. I was more than pleasantly suprised. I couldn't help loving every second of it. So of course, I ran out and bought the DVD and soundtrack (had to hear Ewan sing 'Your Song' on it). I only wish I hadn't avoided it when it was at the theatre. The performances by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were oustanding. And Jim Broadbent was simply delightful as over the top Zidler. The Like a Virgin scene was soo amuzing! And the Tango de la Roxanne scene is flawless and incredibly moving. The colors are vibrant, the pace is quick, the direction is amazing and the dance scenes are intoxicating. <BR>I think I've watched this movie at least 5 times, and I could probably watch it every night. It's that entertaining, and in the end that's what it's suppose to be. <BR>Not to say that this movie is for everyone by any means (that's made quite clear if you've seen some of the other reviews on here). But you have to check it out for yourself. If I went by what other people have said about it, I probably never would have discovered this delightful treat of a movie. It truly is my favorite movie of 2001, if not my favorite movie of all time.
B00003000M|5.0|this is probably my favorite cd ever even though reggae isnt my favorite type of music-awesome cd-features a lot of amazing voices and lyricists-amazing outcome when they mixed traditional marley reggae with some dub reggae and some rap and even guru's jazzy hip-hop<BR>highly recommened
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is truly one of the best love stories every filmed! Set on the back drop of World War II, this movie is full of adventure, suspense, romance and passion!  Bogart and Bergman sizzle together on screen. <br />This motion picture has the ability to transform the audience into another world.  The acting is superb, the script is solid, and the musical soundtrack is magical.  Everytime I hear &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; I get chills. <br />If you have not seen this film before, do yourself a favor and watch it!  They don't make movies of this caliber anymore!
B00005JKED|5.0|well what can i say about this movies itz really good itz realist about police corruption the drugz i think if y like action on drama this iz that movies for u and if u dont well dont bother seeing it but ull regret it  trust me i thought i wuz ganna come out felling sorry for seeing it at the movies but i wuz wrong it wuz really good enjoy it........
B0000214F2|5.0|Robin Williams' portrayal of Dr. Patch Adams' medical school adventures was both entertaining and inspiring.  Although Williams' comic genius shined through in his physical humor of clowning around (e.g. entertaining sick children by dancing with bedpans on his feet, an enema bulb on his nose and an IV stand as a dance partner) as well as quick verbal banter, the comedy is only part of Williams' acting repertoire and movie's appeal.  Having seen Robin Williams mostly in interviews where he seemed to be spending every second trying to be funny, I was amazed at his ability to not only be serious, but to convincingly portray a spectrum of non-comic emotions/conditions:  shock, grief, guilt, frustration, anger.  All was not fun and games in the medical school education of Patch Adams, as he dealt with personal issues, personality clashes and the difficulties of trying change the institution of medicine without getting thrown out of medical school.   I also enjoyed the work of the supporting cast of fellow medical students, instructors, administrators, nurses and patients.  One especially amusing character was Patch Adams' pompous, roommate Mitch, played with a straight face by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Seeing Adams' effect on the people he knew over time was enjoyable and heartwarming, yet realistic:  some warmed up immediately, some over time, and a few, unfortunately, not at all.  <br />But what makes this movie 5 stars is that combined with the good acting and entertainment value, many life's lessons are portrayed.  Here are just a few of many.  The value of:<BR>* treating patients (and all people) as individuals with feelings, dreams, interests and talents to improve their quality of life, regardless of whether one can cure a disease.<BR>* patience, kindness, persistence, humor and imagination in dealing with personality conflict.  <BR>* having a dream, believing in yourself, and selling that vision to others who can help you manifest it.<BR>* having the persistenceto deal with obstacles that get in the way of manifesting one's dream.<BR>* having the courage to speak and act out against injustice, even at considerable personal risk.<br />It's well worth watching this movie to gain wisdom from Patch Adams' life while being entertained by Robin Williams and a host of fine actors.  However, those a expecting fast paced movie with lots of adventures and subplots may be disappointed.
B00004Z459|5.0|I´m a hiphop fan. I hardly listen to other music´s genres...But before I listened rap, I had listened rock, and when Public Enemy joined Anthrax on that 'Bring The Noise' review I love it..I realize that RaP&Rock could mix together. Then \\"Judgment Night\\" dropped and nowadays a lotta bands r incorporating some hiphop´s elements.<br />When I listened \\"Crawlin\\" I wasn´t impressed, but \\"In The End\\" changed my mind...So I copied the album and listen almost every day...Linkin Park brings another energy to the table...It´s more a rock band...They don´t sound like Limp Bizkit for example. Linkin Park´s sound is more raw...The singer is good and the rapper is average, at least both r better than Fred Durst (But I thin Limp Bizkit it´s great). From beggining to end you can feel the energy of those guys, it´s a pitty that it less than 40 minutes...But it´s really good. I was really impressed...In fact I´m listening right now!!<br />I´m waiting for their next album.
020530902X|5.0|There are established rules in every creative endeavor. This can be rules for harmony and rhythm in music, how lines and shapes relate in architecture, or how we understand the written word in writing. It can be argued that you can produce solid, functional work if you know the rules; you produce memorable work by breaking the rules. What this mindset fails to take into account is that sometimes the memorable work is memorably bad, or sometimes relegated to be part of a passing fad such as &quot;twelve-tone music.&quot; Use Strunk and White to learn basic writing rules that give every appearance of holding up over time. Follow these rules and your writing will be very clear and functional, no matter why you write. Over time, you will learn when to break the rules in Strunk and White to produce a good result. Before that point, you need to learn the rules and what the rules try to accomplish.
B00000IQV6|5.0|'Patch Adams' is a well done and highly entertaining movie through and through.  The basic message of compassion for the sick, and getting to know your patient comes through in a big way, and the humorous scenes are funny as hell!  Robin Williams is an American institution, and a wonderful actor as well.  The movie is both touching and funny, and a joy to watch.
B00001OH7N|5.0|Nowadays it's interesting to listen to music from the &quot;classic rock&quot; period and see just what stands the test of time.  Bowie, who was always on the cutting edge of new trends, wrote music that is still very relevant today.  The great thing about CDs like this one is the combination of an alternative sound with superior musicianship.  I always listen first for the drive of the rhythm section, and this one in &quot;Man who sold the world&quot; is top of the line.  When you add the superior song writing and overall edge you end up with great songs like &quot;All the Madmen,&quot; &quot;Savior Machine,&quot; and the title track.  Of course I am partial to everything Bowie wrote up through &quot;Lodger.&quot;  There are amazing contrasts in every CD.  I am a bit irritated, though, about the reissuing of the CDs on Virgin.  Amazing how we've lost the bonus tracks and still end up paying more. Oh well, that's capitalism.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|Everything about this film seems fake. That's not<BR>necessarily bad, if the look is creative, but the<BR>trouble with \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is that there is no<BR>chemistry between the two leads. The emotional<BR>core of the story feels as theatrical and<BR>artificial as the computer-animated Paris. It<BR>might have worked as a musical if the drama<BR>hadn't been undermined by the thin, semi-pro<BR>singing voices of the two leads. They're<BR>unconvincing when they most need to sell their<BR>feelings to the audience.<br />The question with this romance, or any, is why?<BR>In \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" our writer sees the glamour queen<BR>across the dance floor and becomes unglued, that's<BR>why. His infatuation is from then forward played as<BR>high drama. It's never believable. And the fact she<BR>two-times him continuously never changes him. He's<BR>in love with the image, no matter what lies beneath<BR>the surface.<br />The worst blunder is her fatal disease. We see Satine<BR>early in the story coughing up blood. It's impossible<br />after that to forget that bloody mouth every time<BR>the writer closes in on her face. What are you<BR>supposed to feel when you're wondering if that bright<BR>red stuff is all lipstick? The closing death scene<BR>is truly awful. A great romance would dictate a final<BR>embrace; but the film can't show him kissing her<BR>disease. I caught myself thinking, \\"Don't do it, man!<BR>You've got your whole life ahead of you!\\"<br />Another point. Where this film was supposed to be<BR>funny, I found it loud, obnoxious, and overdone. The<BR>only genuine amusement I got was from the introduction<BR>of modern pop lyrics into the dialogue.<br />What's best about this film? The eye candy is truly<BR>spectacular. But you've pretty much seen everything<BR>you need to see in the first half. The second half<BR>is mostly a repetitive backdrop for a story that not<BR>only slows down but becomes more a downer with every<BR>passing minute. I was relieved when it ended.<br />If you want to see this kind of thing done well,<BR>check out \\"Cabaret.\\"
B00003CXTF|5.0|When I walked out of the movie.I felt like I had actually experienced the attack.Very intense movie,and it should be.The audience was both white haired and young.Absolutely incredible Special Effects.I give it two thumbs up and a A+.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I was not expecting to like this movie as i have read the Ann Rice Vampire Chronicles and as we know, movies can not seem to capture the feeling of the novel. Well i was pleasantly surprised at what i saw. Great photography and i doubt any other actors could have done what Pitt and Cruise did for Louis and Lestat. Whether you are a fan of Ann Rice or you just like Vampire movies, this one is sure to please.
0767830555|5.0|In this movie, Travis Bickle(Rob) is a lonely taxi driver in New York City.  He is very cynical af everything around him and is very lonely and isolated from everyone and everything because he fails again and again in his simple quest of human relationships and companionship.  He becomes fed up with the scum and filth he encounters daily in NYC and becomes more and more isolated.  His life changes one night when he runs into this young prostitute Iris(Jodie Foster) and dicides that he must help her, recue her from the scum of the city.  I really dont want to give this movie away but it made it onto the American Film Institute's (AFI) 100 best american films list.  It was put on that list for a reason.  You'll wanna own this movie.
B00003CXTG|1.0|A decent war movie seems to be an endangered specie... If you must see Pearl Harbor, that is your problem, but I have to tell you that I cannot decide if I should laugh or cry. Impossible plot, disregard for any historical fact, apart of the actual bombing, shallow as a grave. from where did they find such a genius screenwriter?The plot is as dumb as 500th piece of Brasilian soap opera (no offence to Brasilians, though).<BR>My personal best is the main hero being shot down in full sun and emerging from the waters in the night (and close to shores of Spain or something...instead of middle of the English Channel). Worldwide record in underwater swimming without aqualung, my congratulations!!!!!!!!!! Plus many anachronisms, plus absolutely no idea of the movie whatsoever besides waving the flag. Also waving the flag could be done intelligently! For reference please see really good war movies and Americans did quite a few of them. <br />PS I actually decided to laugh for about a half of the movie.<BR>PS PS One star is far too many...
B00000AFWZ|5.0|....all these glowing reviews and not one mention of the best song on all 4 discs. I'm speaking about the NAZZ and \\"Open My Eyes\\".<BR>Lenny Kaye nailed this one in the original vinyl liner notes:<BR>they sound too English to be included with Count Five, Ted Nugent<BR>and The Barbarians but never fear, the Nazz (featuring future Wizard & True Star, Todd Rundgren) were firmly rooted<BR>from Philadelphia, PA -- the true birthplace of rock & roll.<br />Oh and to that kid who claims that Punk started with Green Day etc.,<BR>Please.<BR>Come back when you grow up.
079284632X|2.0|I'm not really going to rate this Craven remake of Bergman as a movie. The full \\"Last House on the Left\\" would get about 4 stars from me, I suppose. But here I will concentrate on this VHS release only. As for the movie itself, yes, it's far overrated. But, in a way, I was expecting it to be. But I just wanted to see it, since it's one of those \\"musts\\" on a horror conneisseur's movie list :), even though it has plenty of bad elements - the wooden \\"actress\\" who plays Phyllis, the unconvincing parents, the dumb bumbling cops (supposed to be comical elements, I presume), and the music (composed by Krug :))), which is B-A-D (the opening theme is okay, and as a whole, the soundtrack might stand on its own, for this kind of music. But the point is that it absolutely does NOT fit the mood, for God's sake! Hence - it's bad *for this movie*, because it doesn't work in it and only takes away from whatever ambience is created). The movie's gritty look and bad sound quality don't really add to the atmosphere too much. But, as I said, it should be on the list of \\"horrors to see\\". Even with all its shortcomings, \\"The Last House on the Left\\" is still miles above that pathetic trash horror-wannabe known as \\"the Blair Witch\\"!<br />But that's all beside the point. What I'm rating here is this *release* rather than the movie - hence only two stars. Firstly, it's not widescreen, although as far as I can tell the original was. Secondly, it's CUT! The idiot censors were at work here, obviously. Gone are many scenes, including the famous \\"cow intestines\\", \\"give her a hand\\" and \\"gotta leave something\\" ones (the last one is partially present in a two second flashback), and that's what makes this release unacceptable. Sure, it's cheap, and certainly I wanted to see it so much that I even accepted the inferior quality of NTSC :), and I guess if I knew it was censored, I would've bought it anyway... but still, it's not okay. I hate censorship. If you don't mind this movie being heavily cut or,like me, just want to see it anyway, you might as well get it in this release, since it seems to be the only non-underground one available. Otherwise, you might want to wait for a full release, which is - reportedly - in preparations.
B00005AR3G|5.0|My fiance was loathe to rent this movie with me because he thought it would be stupid.  Instead we spent the entire time laughing.  The jokes are very funny and often unexpected.  Even when you do see something coming, there is generally a twist thrown in to make it hillarious.<br />The movie most definately doesnot take itself seriously, often purposely falling out of the time period and setting or solving impossible situations with impossible solutions.  It was completely off from you standard Disney fare in this respect, reminding you not only of Disney, but I also couldn't help but thinking of the Looney Toons.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised with this movie, even if you are not a fan of normal Disney Full-length features.
B00005U2LM|4.0|Let's get one thing clear, Inspectah Deck, GZA, and Masta Killa hold this whole darn album down!  Raekwon does have one of his better lyrical moments on \\"Iron Flag\\", but he mostly stays in his flip-phone-granola-mottorola-icy frame of spitting.  Ghostface is slightly sub-par, probably still shaking the lyrical dust off from his excentric, slightly rushed, and somewhat incomplete 'Bullet Proof Wallets' album.  RZA isn't bad; he avoids the 'Digital Bullet' pitfalls and comes here with the prime beats tweaked with horns, some decent flows, and even a hilarious album intro.  U-God plays his supporting cast role to perfection as usual.  They even find a way to add PE member Flava Flav, for a catchy hook, even though he talks too much towards the end of the track.  But collectively, the WU offers listeners a good album.  The album doesn't really strike you at first, apart from the three MCs' powerful lyrical bursts mentioned at the very top.  It's the kind of album that will grow on you, with time.  Coming off of the success of 'The W', and now quickly delivering 'Iron Flag', the WU shows that they still have it!  The legacy is still intact.<br />They haven't fallen off..............<br />yet.
B00000K0DU|3.0|A psychopath is killing women in New York and the police are looking for him... that's the plot. Add to that some semierotic scenes, a killer who talks like Donald Duck, some gore and a quite cool (at least so I thought) psychological explanation in the end, and you get a flawed but quite entertaining horror-thriller by Lucio Fulci.<br />The plot is quite ordinary, but the movie has a somewhat eerie feeling about it. The only other Fulci movie I've seen so far, \\"The House by the Cemetery\\", had more of the same eerie feeling, which was one of the best things about that movie. A killer that sounds like Donald Duck may sound silly, but it's actually good, and a bit spooky.  I don't need for horror movies to be very gory, and the breast/eyeball scene in this movie wasn't very nice, but those who like gore will love it.  <br />Like The House by the Cemetery, this movie has some flaws, but not too much. Here is no annoying character, like the little boy in \\"The House...\\". This is an entertaining and sometimes scary horror-thriller (some would prefer calling it a slasher). It has a good ending. It also has quite good cinematography.
B00003CXA2|3.0|I realize I'm in the minority here, but I found &quot;Gump&quot; - both at the movies and on DVD - far inferior to all its hype.  Sure, Tom Hanks gives a noble performance, and his one liners rank with other classics from the world of film, but this sweeping tale is way too ludicrous to be believed.  Certain scenes are astounding acheivements - especially the editing of monumental historical moments that put Forrest front and center.  Yet, where is the movie's heart?  Personally, I found it in Sally Field's performance as Gump's mother, and in Gary Sinise's terrific Oscar-worthy moments as his platoon leader.  Overall, the movie really asks an awful lot from its audience - you must suspend all semblence of time and space, reality and history in order to be taken away.  Yet, in the end, it's a soft melodrama, on the order of other Hollywood blockbusters that deserved less praise (think &quot;Terms of Endearment.)
0345440803|5.0|Hogg does an excellent job of calming the frazzled nerves of parents with toddlers.  I'm the single mom of a &quot;spirited&quot; toddler.  And I thought I was going to lose my mind.  I read this book a week ago, and things are already better.  She has parents examine their behavior as well as that of the child's. She doesn't present it as if you are an awful parent if your child won't go to sleep or throws fits that are unmanagable.  But there is a problem, or you wouldn't be reading this book in the first place.  And what I find the most amazing thing about her book is that she offers no quick fixes.  In a time when everyone wants to lose 10 lb. in one week, and have their children sleep through the night in the same amount of time, Hogg says it cannot be done.  What she suggests is introducing limits and actually *being* the parent.  Her method takes time.  I am an attachment parent, and I find no conflicts between this style and mine.  She does not ever say you should lock your child in a room and walk away or otherwise desert him.  She's not a Ferberer. She's also against spanking, yelling, slapping, shaming and teasing.  In the past I've become very angry with my child because of his behavior.  Now I can understand where his behavior comes from, what I've done to let the situation get out of hand and not only can I deal with him better, I can prevent most of the behaviors that drive me up a wall. A great book for tired parents.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|A film that withstands repeated viewings, Shrek dazzles in every frame.  Meyes, despite his confounding dialect, makes a terrific OGRE, while Eddie Murphey proves his mettle as one of the finest comedians of our time.  Cameron Diaz is terrific, and John Lithgow shines too, but perhaps the film's finest moments are its toungue-in-cheek references to Disney characters, who are ALL represented here, from Snow White to the Three Bears.  Best of all are the Three Little Pigs, whose fey German accents will make you whoop with laughter.  A Classic on the order of &quot;Babe&quot; and &quot;Toy Story&quot;.
B000056HE9|2.0|Being a lover of old films, I am happy to read the glowing and enthusiastic reviews featured at Amazon.  I have always felt that \\"The Bishop's Wife\\", for all it's charm and whimsy, is only an average story.  What REALLY ELEVATES it into an altogether magical and heartfelt classic is, in my opinion, the incredible musical score by Hugo Friedhofer.  In those scenes in David Niven's sombre study we hear shimmery, otherworldy sounds, the chorales which drift in and out, with the saxophone melody that symbolizes the appearence of the angel in human form...now THAT\\"S what great filmaking is about!<br />And yet, let's face it: David Niven's problems are really pretty insignificant compared to, say, what Jimmy Stewart faces in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".....here it's all vanity, wounded pride, confrontations with an arrogant old woman, etc....It's tough for me to get too concerned for a cleric who lives with his family in a fabulously lavish house and seem to have all the comforts of the rich and famous, right down to servants and cooks....the plot is really rather tedious in a way.<br />But still, I really enjoy the movie---it has a wonderful mood, especially in the scenes near the old church and in the professor's apartment, as Christmas Eve is growing near and we know the problems must all resolve themselves soon.  I really like the final scene, where the old church is alive again, the boy's choir is singing its new hymn, the atheist professor is attending midnight mass...and everyone seems to be aware on some level that their lives have been touched by something magical...even though they don't CONSCIOUSLY remember Dudley's visit. Pretty cool.<br />I remember reading that Cary Grant really didn't care for the script and bascially walked through his role. I have always felt that way; for all of his charm, there's something cynical and jaded about his performance, if ever so slightly.<br />But there's that lovely skating scene---was that the way it really used to be in the \\"Old Days\\"??  A skating rink with a live band playing--how cool!  Of course, all of the fancy skating is done by doubles, but there's that lovely closeup of Cary Grant and Loretta Young gliding together as James Gleason finally gets the hang of it---what a wonderful moment (again, Mr. Friedhofer's MUSIC really makes the scene work!). But WHY didn't they give us a final close-up of ALL THREE skaters--Dudley, Julia, and Sylvester---gliding together arm in arm----instead of all of those long shots which used professional skaters as doubles? It would have really capped the scene off beautifully. Oh well....<br />BUT NOW I MUST ASK----IS THIS THE BEST DVD TRANSFER THAT MGM COULD GIVE US FOR THIS FILM?????  It's dark and gritty looking---lots of grain in the image...and the volume level is so LOW---I had to crank up my TV volume all the way to really hear it.<br />THE DVD transfer is a MAJOR BAD JOB; it's alarming to think that this release might represent the BEST AVAILABLE source material for this fine film. That would be a great shame.  I hope that something better turns up and that MGM will re-release The Bishop's Wife and give it the treatment that it deserves.Old Days\\"??

B00003CXA3|5.0|What a film!  The action is incomparable, the chase sequence has never been duplicated, and Freidkin's direction deserved wide praise.  Gene Hackman is amazing, and anyone with a penchant for crime drama should own this superb film.  Hackman never ceases to surprise, and Scheider makes a terrific supporting character.  Want to see geniuses at work?  Own this one of a kind classic!
B000000WGL|5.0|Still great after 14 years, \\"Talk is Cheap\\" still shines with all that wonderful slip-slidey, loose and groovin' stuff that is Keith through and through. I also love Mick's \\"Wired All Night\\" and usually play them back to back. Separate or together Keith and Mick always rock.
B0000029DD|5.0|a dear friend recently gave me this CD at a difficult time in my 50-plus years of life where on many days i find myself challenging the desire to live as much as i embrace it.  during my very first cursory listen to Jeff Buckley, i was happy to hear the penetrating cosmic, if you will, blues voice that reminded me of rock favorites, Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin) and Freddie Mercury (Queen).  many days passed until this morning when i returned to Jeff Buckley for my second, careful listen.  WOW!  his voice notwithstanding, i propose he can mesmorize even the most cynical with his guitar.  (and then i read that he died in 1997 at age 31 - how, i wonder?  i think i know...?)  suddenly, *Hallelujah* begins to play.  i am frozen - blissfully - in time.  against the backdrop of this penetrating soulful rendition, i am flooded with memories of my teenage passion for Leonard Cohen and his writings in the late 1960's.  (can you believe *Flowers for Hitler* is unavailable??!!)  rather than blather about Jeff Buckley, i think the following from Leonard Cohen will tell you why you want this hauntingly beautiful CD in your collection.  through his music, albeit a fleetingly short time <sigh>, Jeff Buckley was *at home in the world.*         <br />thanx, Drew.  love, Cindy <br />p.s. a special thank you to Leonard Cohen:  <br />*What is a saint? A saint is someone who has achieved a remote human possibility. It is impossible to say what that possibility is. I think it has something to do with the energy of love. Contact with this energy results in the exercise of a kind of balance in the chaos of existence. A saint does not dissolve the chaos; if he did the world would have changed long ago. I do not think that a saint dissolves the chaos even for himself, for there is something arrogant and warlike in the notion of a man setting the universe in order. It is a kind of balance that is his glory. He rides the drifts like an escaped ski. His course is the caress of the hill. His trackis a drawing of the snow in a moment of its particular arrangement with wind and rock. Something in him so loves the world that he gives himself to the laws of gravity and chance. Far from flying with the angels, he traces with the fidelity of a seismograph needle the state of the solid bloody landscape. His house is dangerous and finite, but he is at home in the world. He can love the shape of human beings, the fine and twisted shapes of the heart. It is good to have among us such men, such balancing monsters of love.* - Leonard Cohen, Beautiful Losers (1996)
B000000WGL|5.0|Still great after 14 years, \\"Talk is Cheap\\" still shines with all that wonderful slip-slidey, loose and groovin' stuff that is Keith through and through. I also love Mick's \\"Wandering Spirit\\" and usually play them back to back. Separate or together Keith and Mick always rock.
B000024D4R|5.0|I grew up listening to classical music. To this day, I reflect on major and minor works in this genre; in particular, I am especially fond of the major symphonic works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven (the greatest of the symphonists), Mahler, Brahms, Dvorak, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Shostakovich, Sibelius, and Schubert, and have an equal fondness for such composers as Saint-Saens, Ravel, Rimsky-Korsakov, Kallinikov, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Holst, Vaughn Williams, Smetena, Handel... you get the picture.The point of my introduction isn't to show off (and how sad that many view a love of classical music as \\"showing off\\"), but to lend context to what I am about to say, which is this: Animals contains, by far, some of the greatest music ever composed in the rock idiom. This doesn't mean that Animals is a perfect album; far from it. It lacks the jewel box quality that Dark Side of the Moon has, that sense of every note being in the right place. And while it lacks the scale of The Wall, it is far more focused. But when I compare the sheer visceral thrill of the music, particularly of Dogs, with anything else I can find in rock music, I shake my head in wonder--after countless repeated listens to this work, stretching nearly 25 years of my life, the music still holds up, still intrigues, still satisfies.I can think of nothing in rock--nothing by the Beatles, nothing by Genesis (even with their wild invention), nothing by Yes, nothing by ELP, nothing by any other artist or group, that matches the musical scale of Dogs, with its perfect musical transitions, inspiring guitar-work, and an instrumental section that is the singularly most glorious episode I have ever encountered in all of rock. And this is the essential point: though most reviewers here focus on the \\"theme\\" of the album, it is the *music* that makes this album great. The lyrics on Animals are dark, but full of poetry and sharp sparks of light: \\"wave upon wave of demented avengers march cheerfully out of obscurity intothe dream.\\" \\"that's what you get for pretending the danger's not real/Bleating and babbling you follow the leader down well-trodden corridors, into the valley of steel.\\" The recitation that concludes Dogs is powerful, layering each line on top the other: \\"who was fitted with collar and chain/who was trained not to spit in the fan/who was told what to do by the man/who was only a stranger at home.\\" Most important, Dogs in clearly autobiographical, though in an \\"acting out\\" as opposed to a confessional manner; it is Waters identifying something in himself, though I do not believe that it is necessarily true in the deepest sense.What I'm saying is, this is thinking persons' music, music to listen to and reflect upon, music that will still be listened to in two hundred years, when so much of the music we take for granted will become historical curiosities and mostly forgotten. It is classical music, deeply classical even. Other albums may be better constructed (such as Dark Side or even Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run, which is only a few notes shy of being a perfect album), other albums may be more important in terms of their historical impact (such as the Beatles' Seargent Pepper, the Rock equivalent of Beethoven's Third Symphony), and other albums may be more fun (B-52s, for example). But Animals still stands as one of the greatest works so far to come out of Rock.
B00005MP58|5.0|Once in a while life rewards us unexpectedly and I decided to write this review in gratitude of such surprises. It starts with my daughter, aged 16, innocently recommending the book 'Pride and Prejudice' to me because she had recently read it at school.<br />Before reading the book I was prompted to visit Amazon and I noticed that there had been the BBC period-drama in 1996 which I hadn't seen. Following the link I found the many hearty endorsements which you are now reading, and - considerably enthused by the chorus of praise - I decided that it would be preferable to watch the movie first.<br />Well, I thought, this could be pretty good; I set my expectations fairly high. But nothing, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to happen. A five-hour high-speed emotionally-moving insight-bringing experience which started off like a bomb and just got better and better and better as each hour progressed. It left me gasping for breath at how such a feat could be achieved.<br />It has been noted by many of the reviewers that they stayed up till 4am. I was the same; it would have been quite impossible to have left it unfinished. The humour was glorious, and having read just a little of the book, I can see Ms. Austen's hand in this; her wit is perfect (witty on page one of the book!) and it is astonishing to discover that she is still hilarious now, 200 years later. For example... the obsequious Mr Collins! What a hoot! And I will add, well done actor David Bamber. Austen's other strengths are also unmissable: the power of insight into human nature. Elizabeth and Darcy. I am a sucker for shedding a tear at movies and I make no apology, I'm sure many of you will have experienced the same in the good cause of true love revealed.<br />The cinematography, the scenery, the production, the direction, the humour, the music, the sheer attention to detail; all these things contribute to this considerable accomplishment, but of course it has not escaped the attention of this reviewer that it is the acting which carries it.<br />Racking my brain for a criticism, I found one: The movie is at least six hours too short. I didn't want it to end.
0953104907|5.0|While I was expecting a little more on the end of actual \\"blueprints\\" on guitar making (which this book has none of).  It does have very helpful schematics for pickup wiring and very very useful tables on fret lengths of all guitar scales.<br />With the negative out of the way... This book is great.  It will take you through the construction of three guitars.  A solid-body attached neck PRS style guitar, a bolt-on neck Tele style and a neck-through style bass.  Mr. Hiscock then goes on to show the limitless possibilities for combining the styles.<br />His reasoning for not putting in an \\"blueprints\\" for a guitar were simple.  #1, a custom made guitar is like a fingerprint.  It is unique and personal to you.  You make what is comfortable and good for you.  If he gave you blueprints, you'd just be recreating a Melvyn Hiscock guitar.  #2 (not mentioned, but implied) Copyright reasons.  He can't go around telling you how to make a Fender Strat... That would just be bad news for him if Fender ever found out.<br />Anyway, 4-1/2 stars... but I can't do that here, so 5.
B000001Y79|5.0|\\"NO DOUBT\\" finally brought ska to the mainstream.  For reasons unknown, this bouncy and rather laid-back music style has always remained on the fringe.  Why?  Probably, because, in addition to being fun music, ska at times, can get rather juvenile.  Examples are: \\"Everything Sucks\\" by Reel Big Fish, anything (and everything) by The Aquabats, or even No Doubt's first two albums.  The playfulness works when you are just hanging out, but when your soul is bleeding, or even just dry heaving, you want more than ten ways to hang out at the 7-11.  There is a sweet and sensible maturity about this album that still retains the whimsicality that is ska music.  But that is how life is-valleys of sad and peaks of sunshine.<br />\\"Tragic Kingdom\\" is a step foreword and up ward, nor only for the band, but for ska groups everywhere.  You have this killer, rolling beat under-girding profound lyrics and thoughts penned by fluent Gwen Stefani.  Like Bono, she has a poetic spirit that makes her ideas and sentiments very powerful, years above the normal gutter clap-tap that is blared out of most FM stations.<br />The production quality of this album is also years ahead of run of the mill ska.  I realize that Sublime intentionally skunked their sound, and I agree that the roughness worked for the Beatles on \\"The White Album,\\" but it can get overdone at times.  No Doubt recognized this, and it made the album sound professional.<br />This album is not only ska at its best, but also what ska could and should be.  I just hope the other bans pick up on the direction that No Doubt is going, and follow lead.  And I hope No Doubt keeps it up.
B00004T1NA|3.0|Though there are some nice melodies and harmonization it seems PT gets satisfied well before it should.  They take comfort in rapid reprise and semi-dated guitar riffs.  This is understandable as Wilson seems to be able to reproduce the sound of several adequate guitarists (most obviously Fripp).  <br />I have a tendency to be harsher in this review than perhaps I should, but it's only because the Band seems to have an understanding of what good music is.  There is layering and atmosphere, but again there seems to be a real fear of letting go of a very basic comfort level; the copy guitar.  <br />Something needs to change, mainly because they are close to being good.  Perhaps someone else should be in charge of lyrics and guitar next time.  The sound should be more complex.  More melody in melody in melody.  Less talking about feelings, and more feeling.  Where is the Hate in Hatesong?  Best wishes.
B000002JS6|4.0|The death of a lead singer is death for most bands.  Look at the Grateful Dead.  The Beach Boys have slowly been pecked away, but when Mike Love actually achieves nirvana, then the group will finally, after 40+ years break up.<br />These rowdy Aussies faced lead singer death, which is usually band death, but coming Back in Black.  They picked the right title for the Album.  Could they really come back?  Their fans have judged that the came back, and that with a vengeance!<br />This album is considered a must by their fans, and I think AC/DC actually became a new band with the new lead howler Brian Johnson.  He not only brought the band from the edge of blackness, but also invigorated them.  I think it was Nietzsche who said that what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  Ever screamed lyric and ragged guitar wail and screech reinforces Nietzsche's observation.
0525946284|5.0|An exceptionally great offering from Mr. Follet. Wonderful plotting and knowledge of his subject. This talented author knows how to capture the atmosphere of the times he is writing about. This was truely a &quot;cant put down&quot; read, worth its weight in gold. I cant hardly wait 'till the next release.
B000000WCA|4.0|There is definitely something here with the Lasses (dare I call them that?). You have the feeling of exuberance and excitement as this gaggle of gals chants their stuff. Is it more than plastic or something else? I don't know, but there is something there. You must congratulate the producers for working their wizardry, but I do confess that the songs without the videos are dead.
B00005U8EM|1.0|I am not sure what the oversight is, but beware! This DVD does NOT come with a DTS (Digital Theatre Sound)Soundtrack as advertized on the package and still by Amazon. It comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Soundtrack (among other DD 2.0 foreign language tracks)Although I LOVE this film, I had already bought the original DVD, and shelled out the money for this one just to have it in DTS sound. I was very disappointed and now have to go to all the trouble of returning it. So, for those of you who enjoy DTS, you are apparently out of luck. If anyone knows of any reparations being made by Colombia / TriStar, please E-mail me!
B000002UB6|4.0|This is perhaps one of my favorite Beatles albums. First, keep in mind that it is a companion to the movie.  They are interactive.  Moreover, you hear the songs as the Beatles wanted them to be, and not with the Phil Spector saccharine that was dumped on after the Beatles had abandoned the project.<br />Another thing this album shows is the Beatles ceasing to be a band, and becoming four solo acts playing simultaneously.  They couldn't even get together for a cover photo!  This process carried over on to \\"Abby Road.\\"  If it is any consolation, as the Lennon-McCartney dyad was dissolving, we finally got to see more of George and Ringo, who were also talented composers.<br />The music is evolved, but stikll in a rough and rudimentary state.  Indeed, it is quite reminiscent of the rough output that we head on the White Album.  But isn't that what Rock and Roll is all about?  I think that when the Beatles focused on studio productions, they lost their gritty edge.  Compare this to U2.  They have become an overproduced band, but they still have enough of a whop left over from their punk days that they can carry concerts.<br />Overall, the songs have hints and suggestions.  This album was a fleeting grasp at what the group had been. The expertise was there, but they had lost the will. Thank goodness they finished this album to give us the last slice of the Beatles pie.
B00003000M|2.0|this album was ment to explore bob's music in to hiphop and R&amp;B lovers rather than his roots reggae fans that on it self is not so bad but did they really had to wake him out of his sleep couldn't they left those great classics alone from all bob's albums i've never heard a duet if bob where still alive he wouldn't work with most of the artist here he won't even no who they are i heard bob once saying in an interview i don't listen to the radio. bob would stick with his own music. there are so many albums of this great legend that for real fans this is a waste of time and they probarly right bob would never be named with persons except for the very talented Hill and Baydu   who have criminal relationships or blow each other to pieces if they really understand bob or his music it wouldn't had to come this far bob rebelt against the soldiers of babylon and that are the people responsible for this album.
B000002UA9|5.0|This album freezes in time all the possibilities that the Beatles could and would become.  You hear shades and hints of their later and greater compositions.  It is the perfect debut album.
B00005QGAX|4.0|It's a good album, it has some good songs.  I like &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; the best.  Great sound quality.  Get it.
B00000F5KH|5.0|I must say this is one of the best movies I ever seen, though it was a long time ago. I am brasilian myself and I lived in Sweden, so I thought of watching a movie from my homeland, and it was so sad that it made me cry from the very first beginning.<BR>But I think it is a good movie because it shows reality, well one view of how it is there.<BR>The actors are great too ;)<BR>And it is the only right that they were nominated for I have never seen such a good movie based on another country other than<br />the Us.
B000002J1F|5.0|After recruiting guitarist Steve Howe for their breakthrough, _The Yes Album_, Yes upped the ante even more with _Fragile_ by adding the flashy Rick Wakeman on keys and synths.  Like Howe's guitar work on _The Yes Album_, Wakeman's contribution to the Yes-sound is instantly recognizable.  <br />_Fragile_ is a pretty damn wild ride.  The album opens up with one of the most recognized progressive rock songs ever, &quot;Roundabout&quot;, and throughout the album, each member of the band gets a chance for their &quot;solo&quot; pieces/compositions - the best of these being Howe's &quot;Mood for a Day&quot;, Anderson's &quot;We Have Heaven&quot;, and Squire's bass monstrosity, &quot;The Fish.&quot;  One of Yes' best songs, if not all that well known by the &quot;casual&quot; fan, is &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot;.  This song alone probably best represents Yes' quintessential characteristics with its classical-tinged piano interlude, melodic drumming, frenetic guitar work, and pumping, funky bass line.   Plus, it rocks harder than nearly everything Yes has ever done.  Capping off the album is the fabulously arranged &quot;Heart of the Sunrise.&quot;  <br />Yes fans and critics alike usually point to _The Yes Album_, _Fragile_, and _Close to the Edge_ as being their best works.  If you're new to Yes, this is probably the best way to start - listening to all three of these albums in this order.  _TYA_ shows a young band building an identifiable sound and style.  _Fragile_ pushes the boundaries of this style and showcases what each individual member of the band is capable of, and _Close to the Edge_ brings it all together to create something truly awe-inspiring.  You really can't go wrong with any of these albums.
0679746048|5.0|I read this book as soon as i seen the movie. I was so much in love with the movie i wanted to read the book so it could go into more detail. Thats exactly what the book did too. If you loved the movie as much as i did then you will love the book more. You learn more about a character and see what happens to susanna after she has been released. Everytime after I write a review i always want to do that Do Do Dooooo like in reading rainbow. Anyways the book is so awesome!
0385505833|5.0|Luther Krank has a brain storm and convinces his wife, Nora that since their daughter could not be with them this Christmas, that going on a cruise would be a nice change from their usual  holiday celebrations.<br />Living in a very conventional and pro-Christmas decorating type of neighborhood, the Krank's quickly find out what their neighbors think about their \\"skipping Christmas\\" attitude.<br />This is quite different from the other books written by John Grisham, but it shows that he can handle writing humor. This was a Christmas gift from Jen &amp; Chris, and was thoroughly enjoyed. Don't miss this book, it makes you take a long look at the commercial side of Christmas.
B000008COG|4.0|This album isn't as bad as people say.  If you like AC/DC then you'll like the album.  &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, &quot;That's the way I wanna Rock n' Roll&quot;, &quot;Meanstreak&quot;, &quot;GoZone&quot;, and &quot;This Means War&quot; are all classic AC/DC songs.  Pick up this album if you get the chance.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This is without doubt one of the sexiest, beautiful, and most erotic films I have ever seen, and yet there is not a single sex scene in the movie. There aren't enough superlatives in my vocabulary to begin to describe it for it is nothing short of perfection in every department from acting, to cinematography, to writing this movie left me longing for more. Hope the transfer to DVD does it justice.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|If you're not a Sade fan, you will be once you listen to this scintillating digest of the west coast chapter of their 2001 tour. If you happened to see her performance, as I did at Madison Square Garden, relive that opening drum beat that ushers the plaintive cry of Stuart Matthewman's guitar serving as the intro to \\"Cherish the Day\\". It goes on like this. Crisp musical presentation, with the crowd energy oozing through, enough to hear and feel but not disturb -- you're there! Even though you've heard the songs before, you hear them anew. You immediately identify that songs sound - not different - but tweaked to perfection. Hey catch, the end of \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\\". Pleasant little treat, there. And when they play \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\", listen to the crowd. They improvise a cool little chorus of their own.<br />You have got to pick this up!!!! Can't wait 'til the DVD drops. Sade, always en vogue. Timeless. 'Nuff said.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|As I bought this CD, I've never heard a song by Ryan Adams before and I didn't have any idea how he might sound, I just bought it because I was curious, because I wanted to know how 'the newest Dylan' sounds and because everyone who heard it loved it. And I swear, buying this CD was one of the best decisions in my life. Every song is just wonderful. From 'New York, New York' to 'Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd.', Adams gets you every time. Maybe it's this mixture of nice rock songs and sensitive and heart-breaking ballads or maybe his talent as a songwriter or maybe anything else what gives you the creeps when you hear it. So if you doubt wheter you should by this CD or not, I tell you do it, if you're a fan of good rock music you won't regret.
B00005RZV4|5.0|there really is not much to say about this.  to sum it up it is a live album of NIN who ,i believe, have a small yet fiercly devoted following.  it is a very good representation of NIN and an awesome live album.  NIN have always lived up to a certain standered and trent never fails us.  he is always himself and his product is pretty much self explanatory and always beautiful.<BR>this album has been in my car since it came two weeks ago.  if your just getting into NIN then this is as good a place to start as any.
B00005V0X5|4.0|The only thing that knocks this deluxe re-release down from 5 stars is the fact that &quot;Boots&quot; is missing...just like it has been from the most recent compact disc releases of the regular album.  Did Nancy Sinatra not like it?  Ah well, I was looking forward to the possible inclusion of &quot;Boots&quot; back where it belongs when I saw the listing for this in Ice, but instead I will settle for the original '84 demos which are an awesome inclusion.  A classic album, that I bought on cassette in junior high (Megadeth who??) sounding better than ever in this great package.  Highly recommended.
B000051Y0G|4.0|I read my previous review and noticed my typos so I'm posting it again because for some reason my edit would not go through. This is a great CD, Cyndi Lauper has a nice distinctive voice. My favorite songs on the CD are Money Changes Everything, Girls Just Want To Have Fun, Time After Time, and All Through The Night, but my favorite Cyndi Lauper song of all time is Time After Time, when ever I heard that song on the radio I had to stop what I was doing and listen to it but usually when I turned my radio on or changed the station the song was usually almost finished, and now since I recently bought this CD I can listen to it whenever I want and I can hear the whole song from beginning to end!

B00004XMTH|2.0|I've never seen the musical Cats and We have the Broadway cast recording which I never really cared for except for a few songs, I was told that I probably didn't care for the cast recording because I have never seen the play so I rented this tape and it was somewhat enjoyable but I just didn't totally enjoy it, it was kind of weird, the plot was very confusing, it just didn't seem to make any sense. Cats is Okay but it just didn't thrill me as much as The Phantom of the Opera did. I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch this or like it but just giving my personal opinion.
0385505833|1.0|I bought this book as a nice, little surprise for my wife at Christmas.  \\"What a nice little picture on the cover,\\" I said to myself when I bought it.  \\"She's always liked Grisham novels\\", I said to myself as I wrapped it in gold foil paper.  \\"This will be so funny, I can't wait,\\" as she opened it.<br />DAMN!  What a piece of...!  This \\"book\\"... so badly, I'm still mopping the floor.  This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read.  I cannot believe it ever got published, and millions of us bought a copy.<br />If Grisham is even interested in redeeming himself in the public eye, he should donate every penny from the sales of this book to a worthy cause.
B00003CXFU|5.0|Dear Potentional Erin Brockovic Viewers: This is an absolute must see movie. NOT just a \\"chick flick\\" you want realistic kick ass video (besides \\"Fight Club\\")? A true inspiration to all young single honest hard working parents out there. Julia Roberts does an outstanding job portraying the real Erin's trial and tribulations. Think having no background law education, or any courtroom experience cant still make you a lawyer? Think you've got NO chance going against a multi million industry? Bullsh*t! Then you need to watch Erin Brockovich.
B000002UCN|3.0|george had many other great songs worth being in a best of collection. many, many solo songs should be here. one example, i believe should have been included, is the sweet &quot;blow away&quot;.  hope that cd is re-released soon.
B00005RDRO|5.0|If you loved this movie on VHS, take a look at the DVD copy. The image is crisp and the colors are incredibly vivid. It was like watching the movie again for the first time. I must admit, a lot of the time I don't see great variation between the VHS copy and the DVD. But, if you love this movie as much as I do, it pays to replace your VHS copy. You'll find yourself saying things like &quot;My God, the carpeting is actually GREEN!&quot;
B000000OYN|5.0|I've loved David Coverdales voice & vocal style ever since his days in Deep Purple. I've loved all the albums he's put out so far but this one stands as his finest work. All the songs are killers. A prime example of what great rock'n'roll albums are made of!!!
B000002NBY|5.0|Good music doesn't get older. This is the point this album keeps on making. What it means is the following; <br />I am now 16 years old. While most of my generation is listening to the newest rising stars, who will be forgotten in the time it takes to blink, I am absolutely loving (!) the good music from yesterday. Everybody I tell of my taste in music looks at me as if I'm crazy, but the minute I let them hear Paul Simon, they have to agree with me; this is the best of the best. <br />My point is the following; today's music isn't any good. If it was, trends wouldn't change so much. If you only look at this one album. People of this generation still absolutely love it, while today's music is forgotten tomorrow...<br />This is music you will remember when you've forgotten everything else. My parents did, and let me hear the great rythms and beats combined with the absolutely great lyrics of Paul Simon's Graceland, and thus got me hooked to one of the greatest artists of the 1980's.

0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's novel \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is one of those great books that defies easy classification. A blend of science fiction, satire, and war fiction, it is both fun and grim. The book tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, an optometrist, World War II veteran, and apparent UFO abductee who becomes \\"unstuck in time.\\" We accompany Billy back and forth from his wartime experiences to his encounters with aliens and to other events in his remarkable life.<br />\\"Slaughterhouse\\" is greatly enlivened by a colorful, richly imagined cast of supporting characters: American-turned-Nazi Howard W. Campbell, movie star Montana Wildhack, and more. But probably the most resonant of these amazing creations is Kilgore Trout, the underappreciated science fiction writer.<br />The book has an intriguing structure. Vonnegut's prose is a joy to experience: he combines a sort of Hemingwayesque simplicity with a knack for rendering startling, and often ridiculous, details. He is often very ironic and funny. Along the way, he explores ideas about free will and the nature of time. Much of the book is about writing itself.<br />In this book there is an intriguing reference to Stephen Crane's classic \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\"; perhaps this reference is Vonnegut's way of directly connecting with the tradition of American war fiction. But this book transcends that genre. \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is sad, surreal, whimsical, brutal, and oddly gentle. It's a remarkable book; I highly recommend it. As an interesting companion text, try \\"The Things They Carried,\\" Tim O'Brien's excellent book about the Vietnam War.

B000006TRV|5.0|I was 15 when this album debuted.  I was an angst ridden teen and I could identify with &quot;Pink&quot; in SO many ways.  This seemless work could move me to tears.  I was so enraged when Christopher Cross' (remember him anybody???) album beat out The Wall for &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the Grammys that I, over 20 years later, still cannot watch ANY awards programs.<br />This album has aged very well.  I can listen to it's tapestry and instantly feel the emotions of that time come sweeping back.  Uncertainty, loneliness, not knowing where to turn next, etc. etc.  Could today's youth identify with it?  Perhaps most of it, who knows?<br />This did for me in high school what The Who's &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; did for me in college.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I always marvel at those gifted souls that possess the ability to control their vocals to a point where they begin to sound like an instrument.  This woman is outright amazing.  I've heard and seen her compared to various artists, but none of them that level of skill. Who cares about the clumsy lyrics and translations, sit back and listen to the sound of it, to the nuances of each rise and fall of a powerful and gorgeous voice, and her amazing ability to change notes numerous times between beats.  She's a songbird, and every time I hear her music, I think of a seriously modern interpretation of the Magic Flute's Aria #14 - Queen of the night by Mozart, of course, you must realise that Shakira is no soprano, but she has the rare ability to do things like that.<br />Spanish AND English, it's obvious Shakira has invested a great deal of herself in the songs, and her accent takes nothing from the music -- I actually think it adds to the character of it. There's a wonderful latin sound mixed in with all this great stuff. I find this CD incredibly good, and I think she's vastly more talented than any of the skanks like Britney or Christina -- it just so happens that she's got a habit of revealing a lot of midriff like they do, thassall.
B0000256KE|5.0|This new release (HDCD) has a incredible sound quality. If you like Roxy Music you should buy it, even if you have the old version!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Simply the bomb!  Sade not only has the voice and the style to carry an audience for hours, but the BAND which includes all the original members with some extras, sounds (if you can fathom this) better than the studio CD.  All the songs are done well with the unique style that a concert goer looking for something extra will appreciate.  However, when they do \\"Is It A Crime\\" at the end... I was just shaking my head.  They know what they're bread and butter signature song is and they maximize the effect with both the music and the voices.  If you missed the concert tour, then definitely pick up the CD.
B00005UEAR|3.0|After reading a great deal of the reviews, I fear I have nothing original to say - sort of like Petrucci's writing recently.  I have to agree that:<br />* The side projects are affecting Dream Theater material/performance.  It seems like they've tossed this together fairly quickly.  They do sound in fine form, it's just that sections of songs sound tacked on and pieced together, rather than being cohesive.  I thought this about parts of SFAM as well.<br />* I can't stand Mike Portnoy's lyrics, and Petrucci's creativity seems to have gone away.  How many songs did Portnoy write on DT's earlier releases?  On I&W and Awake?  One combined, I believe.  And Portnoy's singing annoys me as well.  Ruddess may play like a master, but Kevin Moore's lyrics stick with me to this day.<br />*  Someone called DT a \\"thinking man's band.\\"  That made me laugh.  <br />*  Where is a lyrical contribution from Myung?  Again, not enough time to concentrate on DT?<br />I think, perhaps, that DT listened to the critics too much - the ones who panned FII.  Since that release, in my opinion (and according to my ear), DT has embarked in a different direction.  While artists/musicians should feel free to do what interests them, from a fan's standpoint ... I am gradually losing interest in their releases.  I&W, Awake, and FII are fantastic.  The last few ... good, not great.<br />So, at the risk of getting panned by fanatic DT fans, I give this one 3 stars.  Again, good ... at times very good ... not great.  <br />Guys, take some time off ... and make me a die-hard fan again.
0345440900|3.0|I will admit here that I picked the book up in the bookstore, and being a fast reader, managed to scan a few chapters but didn't buy it.  I especially appreciated her for saying that feeding your baby with a bottle is OK and do not waste time feeling guilty or a failure if you don't choose to breastfeed for various reasons.  I was a complete failure at it, which made me feel frustrated which in turn decreased my milk supply and drove up my blood pressure (I panic very easily).  Giving my kids a bottle with formula took the pressure off of me to perform and be a perfect mother, and I always knew they were well fed and content.  They are older now and are smart and loved very much, which is what Ms. Hogg says is really the most important thing (being loved).  I wished I could've breastfed but it was an activity that didn't quite agree with my own temperament. We bottlefeeders need to be reassured that we're not evil, neglectful or failures if we can't do the breastfeeding thing.  Thanks Ms. Hogg.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Akira is among the father's of anime. As the two main character's scream out each others name in a fast paced conflict, your heart will probably be racing as fast as mine. Akira deal's with, and answer's, one of the question's that has become a paradox...what if we had the power of God at our disposal. The ability to destroy, create, protect, and become invincible.<br />Tetsuo is a youth that is plucked from his biker gang and surrendered to test's in a secret experiment that date's year's into the past. His cell's coincide with a powerful force known as Akira, a hidden entity buried within the guts of a submerged vault. These experiments with Tetsuo prove to be a deadly mistake.<br />Growing up within the boundaries of Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo and his best friend Kaneda have developed into teens that spend their lives wandering blindly through a daily struggle of survival. The gristled street's are plagued with ultra-violence, radical anti-government agencies, religeous cult's, gang rape, and conspiring political's. Within these form's are the molding's of these two central character's. Kaneda has spent his life protecting Tetsuo, and has developed into a hardened product of the system. A secret agency kidnaps and inspect's, Tetsuo. His body is subjected to test's and penetrating scans while he floats within the confines of massive prodding machine's. Once they determine his wave count is unusually high, the lead professor makes the decision to insert a power, known as Akira, into him.<br />As the implanted power invade's Tetsuo's mind he uses the strength to act out forces of violence on the society that created him.<br />Kaneda must decide whether friendship runs deeper than control, and discover's the reason's behind the three mysterious being's that share Tetsuo's power. Akira is a gorgeous pandora's box of tragedy, power, and violence. What would happen if you had the ability of God, and what would be the result? The answer is found within Akira.

0440219078|4.0|The Giver is a young adult book by Lois Lowry about an utopian world where everybody are happy, everybody live in peace an harmony, life is good. At least that's what people are thaught to believe. <BR>12 years old Jonas is a common boy in this society, at least he thinks so himself, But when he comes to the annual ceremony and all his companions are choosen to their common jobs he gets something very special. His task is to become the next \\"Giver\\" in this perfect society.<BR>Through his meeting with the old Giver Jonas discovers that his world is breaking up into peaces. His life gets a new dimension, or actually several dimension, and he is given the choice to save his world.<BR>All young adults should read this book, to learn that their life is important and that what they do, the way they live can make a change. To the better or to the worse. But as individual human beings we all have the possibility, and the human right to choose our path. And the way we live is not only ours. We live in a world together with the rest of the creation, and the way we live make us responsible for the rest of the world.<br />I gave the book a four, due to the ending. The ending was short and also kind of weak in my oppinion. But all in all the book was very good, and a must to read for all of us.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland in Norway
B00005QDW1|5.0|I know that it is not like to other two cd's but I really think thats ok.  As their lives have changed thier music has evolved and it sounds to me like their in a good place right now.  Its just a good fun cd.  Just remember Gwen is no longer sad and angry so if your looking for more angry break-up music you must look elsewhere.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This movie has, what I beleive, the best performance from a child actor ever, from a 12-year-old Natalie Portman. Her character Mathilda shows the innocence of a kid, and the depth of a person out for revenge. Why she didn't get an Oscar is beyond me. And this was her first movie.<br />The story is really good. A hitman named Leon (Jean Reno) helps a girl named Mathilda after her family is shot down by corrupt DEA officers led by Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman). When she finds out about Leon's job as a \\"cleaner\\" she asks to be trained as a hitman to avenge her little brother's death. Despite Leon's concerns he teaches her anyway, but over the course of his teachings, Mathilda develops feelings for him. This is something the uncut version explores a little deeper.<br />I suppose some of the scenes were taken from the American release for their subject matter. A scene where Mathilda wants to take her love for Leon to the next level really gives a good insight into Leon's past. It dosen't lead to anything between the two, so I don't see why they cut it. Other scenes included are Leon giving Mathilda some on the job training when he goes on his hits. I can see where some groups in America could have protested that, but it makes their relationship more deeper and complex. <br />An outstanding film, you really should see this version to get the whole story. I highly recommend it, it is my favorite of all time. Luc Besson's masterpiece can be fully appreciated on this release. I've been hearing rumors about a sequel in the works. I can only pray it's true, but this film is a tough act to follow.
B000026OHN|5.0|Don't die yet! Listen to this first... and know what you'll be missing if you don't go to heaven! These magnific recordings were made during early 70'ties, when Richter was arround 55 years old and on the top of his mastery - making the Bosendorfer piano sing like an angel (!), - a miracle, lets say, that made of it my favorite recording of WTC. <br />The sound quality is '4 stars', but the musicality is outstanding: on tempos, rubbatos, melodic lines, colors and fit's Richter's recording among other archangels' of this masterwork, as Fischer's, Tureck's, Gould's and Demus's.
B0000524E5|1.0|This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made. Created for the &quot;Frat Boy&quot; demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the &quot;small town girl goes to the big city&quot; story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the &quot;T&quot; &amp; &quot;A&quot;.  <BR>   Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? At least the &quot;acting&quot; is better on those cable shows.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I'm shocked by all of the bad reviews of one of my FAVORITE films of 2001 (up there with \\"Mulholland Dr.,\\" \\"Ghost World,\\" and \\"Memento)... The story is redicously cheeky (which is always a good thing) and not pompous and superficial , like \\"RHPS.\\" The music and the music scenes outshine anything \\"Moulin Rouge\\" attempted to do ... The acting and phototgraphy are beyond expectations for a LOW-BUDGET stage adaptation. My only problem is the storytelling. It has so many plot holes, is so short, and leaves so much to question, like how did Hedwig meet Yitzag? (which is explained in a deleted scene, that really shouldn't have be left out, on the DVD), What happens to Hedwig after the end of the film? Will (s)he ever regain he(r) career? Where did the Angry Inch (the band) come from? Do any members of the band have a persona? What happens to Tommy? Will he and Hedwig get back together? What happens to Hedwig's mother? What happened to the Korean wives? Does Hedwig win the lawsuit? These may sound off-the point compared to the deep \\"Origin oflove\\" themes of the film, but they still linger even after the metaphysical finale. While I still prefer the stage version for the obvious reasons of rapport and better live music and storytelling, the films still surpasses all expectations...
B00003CXI1|2.0|There are too many problems with the movie. Adding to this, the film is based upon the worst book of the series so far. What one could expect?<br />Well, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an attempt of adapting the brilliant writing of JK Rowling this, however, is not accomplished. Some storylines which make perfect sense in the book, in the movie stays a feeling of a badly glued mix up of scenes having only in common Harry. Hagrid's Dragon for instance is one of these badly glued storylines, I would rather if they didn't spoke of it at all!! The meeting with Malfoy is undescribable... there's no sense at all in everything... why would Malfoy go to their compartment? In the book everything is different of course.<br />All in all and without continuing this incessant ranting, I will give 2 stars out of five to the movie just in honour of the very good acting of \\"Hermione\\" and \\"Professor McGonagall\\"; The lack of stars are totally due to the somewhat naive attempt of putting everything of the book in a movie which gets too long too early.<br />I hope that this movie will be, as the book is, the worst of the series.
B00005RHGL|4.0|If you're even considering buying this DVD then you've probably seen the movie already and loved it. So I'm not gonna tell you how good the movie itself is. This is a review of the new DVD treament of Tombstone, more of a content review.<br />I waited for the newer version of this DVD to come out before buying. While the transfer to DVD is perfect and the sound kicks ass, a two DVD set like this should really offer more (e.g. Hannibal, Fight Club, Star Wars I). The movie itself does have a few added scenes making it a \\"directors cut\\", but there aren't any deleted scenes or outakes on either disc which, I feel, is what you'd expect from a set like this. There are some decent features, like the director's commentary and the mini documentary \\"An Ensemble Cast\\" provides some great insight into how the actors view their characters, but that's about it. There's some real garbage on here too. Do yourself a favor and skip the Tomstone Timeline and Epitaph. And unless you want to cheapen your opinion of a great movie, for God's sake, do not watch the trailers and TV spots. Atrocious! Were they really this bad?<br />Perhaps the studio is gauging the interest of the public before putting out a third version of this DVD with a few more features.  I say 5 stars for the film but three stars for the added features. Right now, this is the version you want (enhanced sound, documentaries, etc), but don't expect to be completely satisfied.
B000002KKK|5.0|\\"A Fool For Your Stockings\\" alone makes this a worthy buy. I really dig the solos in Bad-Nationwide as well. If you want riveting solos, make sure you also get the landmark Tres Hombres, the music that gave some northern city boys like me a dose of mindblowingly good southern boogie.  If there were a best-of category for stylish rednecks, these guys would get it.  They are bad ass. Gibbons solos on his early work are legendary, spine-chilling affairs. My personal fave are the two solos in the song Beer Drinkers from Tres Hombres, followed by Waitin For the Bus (again from Tres Hombres), the Bad-Nationwide from this release tied with the end of Sharp Dressed Man from yet another release you can also consider. Don't judge by the samples, if you are a young person curious about these guys, and if you like electrifying hard rock guitar, just get these two albums, and turn it up!
B00005HYHA|5.0|I have listened to Dark Side 1,000's of times on both Vinyl and the normal CD version. When I fist heard of the Japan version I was mainly interested in it because of its mini-lp style case, but when I listed to it for the fist time I was blown away. The why I like it more then the original CD is because it sounds more like the Vinyl version, there is more bass and it uses the Left and Right channels more which gives it more depth due to the fact it sounds more like the music is around you rather then just in front. I would recommend this version to anyone who has a high end system, listens it on head phones, or someone who just wants to collect it because EMI is stopping production.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|How often do you go to see a movie and come out feeling your expectations have been exceeded? It probably only happens to me once or twice a year and I love watching movies. In my opinion this was the first of only two truly great movies in 2001 (The Fellowship of The Ring was the other).<br />Baz Luhrmann's spectacular movie is a new spin on old idea - the movie musical. From the opening set-piece at the Moulin Rouge, an amazing set-piece of complex choreography, involving a cast of hundreds singing and dancing to a sequence of pop/rock \\"classics\\", including such diverse songs as Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and Madonna's \\"Material Girl\\" seamlessly segued together, Moulin Rouge is nothing short of wonderful. Original (with a capital O) from the opening credits to the closing credits, this is in my humble opinion, nothing short of genius.<br />\\"But what's the plot I hear you cry?\\" Well, without trying to give too much away ... a young writer by the name of Christian (Ewan Mc.Gregor)arrives in Paris in search of inspiration which inevitably leads him to the Moulin Rouge. There he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), an elegant courtesan and the star of attraction of the Moulin Rouge, who mistakes the young writer for the very rich Duke of Worcester - cue innuendos galore - and Christian and Satine fall in love. But of course their love is not without complication, as Satine's affections have already been promised to the Duke and the lovers have to embark on a secret love affair...<br />Maybe it does favour style over substance but hey, hasn't it got STYLE!!! This is pop culture at it's finest, wonderfully brash, fantastically OTT and nothing like anything you have ever seen before. Ewan Mc.gregor and Nicole Kidman light up the screen with sexual chemistry, great acting and unexpectedly good voices. And if the Academy has any taste (which is certainly debateable) this should be a winner of something major at the Oscars.<br />PS The extras for the DVD are (unlike many other DVD's) superb and well worth seeing!y other DVD's) superb and well worth seeing!
6305327084|5.0|Scott Rosenberg(screenplay writer of the movie) accomplishes something really amazing in this movie.  You wont find heroes or heroines.  You wont find an amazing story or spectacular scenary in this movie.  You will actually find yourself.  At least, I found myself.  I found myself laughing, not because the jokes played in the movie and the characters are funny (although they really are).  I found myself laughing at myself, because I see myself in the very same situations and quandaries that the characters go through.  this movie very frankly describes middle class suburban life.  I bet millions of people in the states live more or less the same life portrayed in the movie.  What makes this movie great is not so much for its surprises, entertainments, or comedic elements.  the thing that makes this movie really a great movie is the realism of the portrayal.  What makes me really like this movie is the fact that this movie makes me feel comfortable, as if I am back at home.
0201485672|5.0|This is a book where the title explains it all.  There is no hype, no esoteric theory, no new age crystals or silver bullet tool being sold by this book.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is definitely THE BEST movie ever made, hence the five stars.  This is Baz Luhrmann's third and final installment of the Red Curtain series he directed, which also includes &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; and &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet&quot;.  There are a couple comparisons I've noticed that I'll point out right now: The &quot;L'amour&quot; sign on the side on Christian's apartment building is painted on a wall near the pool hall (that happens to be called the Globe Theatre, which is where Billy Shakespeare had his plays performed in England) in &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet&quot;.  Also, the leading lady in &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, Tara Morice, appears in a short cameo at the beginning of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; as a prostitute with cigarette smoke curling out of her mouth who glares at the camera for a split-second before the camera cuts to the Bar Absinthe.<br />I love music, and it was awesome that it was filled to the brim with covers of pop classics from the '80s and '90s, such as Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; among many others.<br />Nicole Kidman was beyond perfect as Satine, the doomed courtesan, and Ewan McGregor did a smashing performance as Christian, the sensitive writer.<br />I can't say enough good things about this movie.  Do yourself a favor and see it!
0780624890|4.0|Before \\"X-Men,\\" before \\"Spider-Man,\\" there was \\"Blade\\". Okay, not in the comic books, but in the realm of comic book-to-movie properties, \\"Blade\\" is the FIRST film ever based on a Marvel comic that didn't totally [stink]. (Anyone remember \\"The Punisher\\"? \\"Captain America\\"? The \\"Fantastic Four\\" movie that was so bad it never even made it to video?)<br />\\"Blade\\" stars Wesley Snipes as the Daywalker, a human/vampire hybrid, who has made it his mission to hunt down the darker half of his own heratige. This movie is heavy on action and the special effects, and if that's what you're looking for it delivers in spades. Snipes is great and Stephen Dorff puts in a great performance as the creepy Deacon Frost.<br />Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan, who created the character, had some legal issues with their credits involving this movie. However the legal battle turned out, they should at least be proud of the product.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Borrowing from the past, adding the present, and giving hope to the future.  You've heard them before, and you don't care because they are that damn good.  The Strokes are the definition of rock and roll, frighteningly perfect, from the attitude to the music.  There is nothing to hate, everything to love.  The Strokes are the greatest band to come out, and we should all be thankful.  Short and sweet songs, they blast out at a terrific pace and never quit.  Raw and energetic, the songs are simple, but they work: stripped down and bare, fantastic guitar solos, and Julian's lonely, arrogant, inviting, and distant voice.  \\"Well, I am too young/And they are too old\\"  At the same time, he possess distinct maturity that gives the record a sort of sensitivity, especially on the slower sadder songs.  You get the feeling that he's gotten his heart broken one too many times.  It works.  The Strokes have an ability to capture the moment, and as such, the music does not like play like individual songs, but rather a story.  It's the fast-paced, sex, and booze NY lifestyle of rock stars doing what they do best.  Too cool.  Too damn cool.

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins presents very interesting findings in his study of 11 good-to-great companies.  The concept of Level 5 Leadership is different from the typical leadership models prescribed by management gurus and completely refreshing.  And his approach toward creating evolutionary change (the flywheel concept) is right on target.  A great template for thinking about leading organizations toward becoming great and sustainable.
B00005RHGK|1.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along that, despite the fact that it has kept me at the edge of my seat throughout, is totally ruined by the ending.  I'm sorry, but I hate endings where the villain wins.  This movie was terrifying . . . sure.  But the thrill, at least to me, is to see how the heroes will finally overcome the villain.  And that doesn't happen in this movie.  If it had a better ending, it might have gotten four stars.  One is as far as I'd go now, and this is only because I can't give it zero.
0689835604|5.0|At our house, this book is a big hit.  My 10 month old son loves to play peek-a-boo, the book only heightens the excitement.  He loves to turn the pages and lift up the flaps to find the baby.  I like the fact that the text is simple and clear.  The flaps are strong and are holding up well, no rips or tears.  This book is a great book for any baby.
B000056N8X|2.0|The first Highlander was such a great movie that I still find myslef drawn to anything related to it.  But Even after the horrible sequel and what I think is better termed a remake  with mario van pebbles this one is even a further departure from the original. The premise and mythology that made the first movie so extraordinary has been perverted to the point of making me sick.   Not to mention the fact that each one of these movies seems to forget that the one before it ever happend.   I liked Adrian paul but the \\"we need more bad guys\\" premise to make a bigger sequel just doesnt play in a movie based on single combat.

B000002NHN|5.0|&quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; is Loreena McKennitt's latest full-length, non-live work, and she has certainly not lost her edge.  While maintaining the traditional instrumentation and the Celtic feel of her earlier works, she continues to broaden her music, pulling in more international influences.  She is also writing more of her own music; unlike much of her earlier works, which borrow heavily from Irish tradition and great European writers like Yeats, Tennyson, and Shakespeare, this album is entirely her own work, with the exception of the incredible &quot;The Highwayman&quot; whose lyrics are by Alfred Noyes.  A clear must-have for any fan of great music.

B000002KCV|5.0|I bought \\"Comes A Time\\" on vinyl when it was first released in the late 70's, and I played it so much I nearly wore it out. I love Neil's gentle, acoustic side, and songs such as \\"Lotta Love\\", \\"Comes A Time\\", and \\"Already One\\" are real stand-outs on this album. However, having said that, every song on \\"Comes A Time\\" is a true gem.<br />I searched everywhere for the CD, and since initially I couldn't find it, I thought the album was never released on CD. I was overjoyed to finally find it, as I was perusing Amazon.com one day! The sound is crisp and clear, and of course there are no pops and scratches which are sadly now a part of my LP.<br />I highly recommend this beautiful CD to anyone who has a true appreciation for acoustic rock with thought provoking lyrics.
B00005JK93|5.0|Yes, the movie musical is back in style this week, but what about next week, or next month?  Moulin Rouge, I fear, will not stand the test of time, whereas \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" will live forever in the hearts of indie fans.  <br />\\"Hedwig\\" is a story of a transexual rocker whos botched sex-change operation left her with an \\"angry inch.\\"  Hedwig's (John Cameron-Mitchell) dilemma is that former lover, Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), has taken credit for all her songs.  Tommy, in turn becomes a rock superstar. Hedwig and her band, The Angry Inch, shadow Tommy's tour, playing gigs in a scuzzy resturant chain, to try and get noticed and get credit. \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" explores the depths of human love, compassion, and will.  Not only that, but it accomplishes all that while still providing some very intelligent humor, and delightful music. (buy the soundtrack, its worth it!) <br />This amazing rock musical is certainly one of my top ten this year, maybe my top ten ever.  It is certainly one of the funniest films I've seen.  \\"Hedwig\\" is a very heartwarming tale, though it deals with off-beat subject matter.  I suggest everyone rush out to rent this movie.  And if you have the chance, get the DVD.  It is chalk full of amazing features.  I especially suggest you watch \\"The Story of Hedwig.\\"  It shows you the off-broadway roots that came to be the masterpiece it is today.
0385506244|5.0|This story is a departure for John Grisham, moreso than that of &quot;A Painted House.&quot; The book is easy to read and enjoyable. That said, this review is for the Limited Edition I received today. My family will cherish this for years to come, I suspect. My immediate family as well as my aunts, uncles, cousins and etc. know of my strong affinity for John Grisham, and it is an honor for me to own #28 of the 350 copies available worldwide. If you get the chance to buy one, perhaps from an auction site, do so. The book comes boxed in a cloth slip cover, numbered and signed by Mr. Grisham himself. Receiving this special item causes me to forgive him for writing &quot;The Brethren!&quot; Even if you don't care for the story at all, attempt to procure this wonderfully handsome book. I haven't decided where in the house I'm going to display it, but folks at work are already wanting to see it. Thank you, John, for signing my copy. Keep up the good work!
0446678430|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good book.  Not much on How-to, more of a  Why-to.  The author spends most of the book recollecting how  he became wealthy, and gives some good advice on why you should press on when things look bleak.  I liked it, and I came away with an understanding that in order to be where you want to go, you have to focus on your business and goals with a singlemindedness that most people aren't willing to reach.  Anybody can do it. I haven't yet, but I will.  It's worth reading if you apply what you learn.
1558216847|5.0|I just finished reading this remarkable book.  It is either one of the greatest stories ever written or one of the greatest literary hoaxes of all time, and it really bugs me that I can't find an answer to this quandry.  I've read ALL of Amazon's reader reviews, so I've seen the extensive SPECULATION on this question.  Has anyone come up with any HARD FACTS to prove or disprove the story?  It seems that there has been sufficient time since its initial publication in 1956 for its supporters and distracters to have marshalled and published their evidence.  Where is it?
0783240287|5.0|This one is a winner for both adults and children. Wonderful music, wonderful acting.
B00005U2LM|5.0|Many people had their doubts about Iron Flag, but I don't.  This album is hot.  GZA is probably the best out of the group with his nice flow and lyrics.  Inspectah Deck is underrated and my favorite.  Method Man is hard.  RZA had some nice beats on this one.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Yall Been Warned&quot;, &quot;Radioactive&quot;, &quot;Uzi (Pinky Ring)&quot;, &quot;Chrome Wheels&quot;, and some others.  If you think the Wu is dead, you're wrong.
7119005901|4.0|the other reviews probably say enough about the Three Kingdoms for me not to repeat them.  I came to this novel after playing the old Koei games, and I loved reading it.<br />My only problem with the box set is that the books' format seemed very poor to me.  After paying 50 bucks (with shipping), it was a little disappointing to realize I only got three (yes three, though the entire novel was there.  I have no idea why it says &quot;4-Volume Boxed Set&quot;) little paperbacks, with a very very small typeset on filmy paper that is very easy to smudge and smear.  Also, there are more typos than there are hairs in Cao Cao's beard.  Distracting.<br />I don't think you should let this deter you from reading the three kingdoms.  But perhaps, if you know you're going to love it, you might want to wait until a much higher class version comes out than the one from the university press I got.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is definately one of the greatest CDs I've ever listened  to. This is The Clash's best album and also one of Rock N' Roll's greatest albums. The great melodies and meaningful lyrics of songs like &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot; really show that the Clash knows their stuff. They weren't just any old rock band, they had a message and boy did they come through in conveying it. Not only did a lot of their works have messages, but they also were damn great musically and had extremely well-crafted lyrics.
B00005JHCP|4.0|There have been so many filmed versions of \\"Copperfield\\" and each has it's merits. This is one of the better ones. The basic story is intact and readers will recognize snippets of dialog taken directly from the book. The casting was quite good, although having Dawn French in this production was a major mistake. A waste of film to be blunt. The other performers shine and Bob Hoskins as Mr. Micawber was an ideal choice. (He had too much hair though, in the book, Dickens describes Micawber as \\"bald as an egg\\") Clara Peggoty was done admirably, without sounding \\"cartoonish\\". I just wish the producers had followed the book more closely. As a history buff and reenactor, I enjoyed the costumes and props as well. Far better than that wretched piece with W.C. Fields (Horrid !!!) Maggie Smith was excellent as Betsy Trotsworth (Jane, DONKIES !!!) and Mr. Creakle was well done.(she is gravely ill...in fact, she is dead) And who can forget Mr. Murdstone and his evil sister ? He should have had a thick beard though. (Read Dicken's description) Even if Dickens is not your cup of tea, sit back and enjoy it.
0385495323|5.0|I read this book few months back. Truly amazed at this book. Infact, I have bought his other book on Fermat's Last Theorem and currently reading it. <br />Getting to the Code Book, I find it amazing to believe that the author has performed a thorough research on history of encryption before writing this book. <br />It was surprising for me to learn that Kama-Sutra has references to encryption! <br />It was equally surprising to learn that Arabs were inventors of a technique called frequency analysis to deciphers text messages. <br />The flow of the book is logical and provoking. And it provides fundamental information, needed for good knowledge on the subject. Certainly modern day CTO's need to go through this book. <br />The author has touched on all aspects of encryption - its progression from the Egyptian civilization many thousand years ago to current breakthrough's in Quantum computing. His account of competition between code-makers and code-breakers is interesting and informative. <br />Now, I am beginning to be skeptical about RSA's encryption. One just do not know which agency has broken it. <br />It will be indeed interesting to watch the competition between code-makers and code-breakers when quantum computing makes it possible for powerful encryption as well as breaking techniques.
B00005JIZA|5.0|Room for Squares- by John Mayer is simple amazing, the songwriting and intricate story's that he tells are very soulful and jazzy. When I first heard this cd I thought he sounded a little like Dave Mathews. He songs are well beyoung the years of such a young artist, such as tunes like &quot;your body is a wonderland&quot;, &quot;Back to you&quot;, &quot;Why Georgia&quot; and &quot;Neon&quot;, I just could'nt get enough of this cd. I have to Thank a friend in San Diego for turning me on to this Cd, its great. I can't wait for the next release from John Mayer, but until that happens I will playing this one in my car for a while....
B00000IPAX|5.0|this is the best blink 182 cd. it is better than TOYPAJ. almost ever song is good except wendy clear, but that is all. go buy this now.
6300217019|3.0|This is one of two breakthrough films for Richard Gere.  The other one was \\"Officer and a Gentleman\\", which cemented his status as a bankable star.  This is also an early film for mega producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, ConAir, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor).  In this film, Gere plays Julian Kaye, a gigolo who services the sexual needs of wealthy older woman.  One of his tricks gets murdered and suddenly all the evidence points to him.  Of course, his alibi refuses to admit he was with her because it would be scandalous.  The last half of the film is devoted to Julian trying to discover who is trying to frame him.  Concurrent with this plot is the story of his love affair with Michelle Stratton (Lauren Hutton) the wife of a wealthy Senator.<br />The story isn't bad, but the dialogue is mindless and trashy, typified by Michelle's repeatedly begging for sex from Julian in the most profane and explicit terms.  There aren't any surprises that aren't completely predictable, and the mystery of who is framing Julian is painfully obvious.  The film features Blondie's hit \\"Call Me\\", but after hearing a couple of dozen Georgio Moroder variations on this theme on his synthesizer, it gets tiresome. <br />Gere's performance shows promise here and his generous nude scenes make this film a favorite among his female fans.  Gere exudes a smart and sophisticated machismo in this film that would be his trademark for years to come.  For Lauren Hutton, who was more famous as a Supermodel than an actor, this role is probably her most notable.  She does an adequate job of playing the aristocratic wife with an untamed libido, but is in no danger of winning any acting awards.<br />This is an interesting film to watch from a historical perspective if you are a Gere fan, but it is by no means a classic.  I rated it a 6/10.  Weak writing hamstrings a decent story and keeps it from rising above mediocrity.
B00005U1YO|3.0|After I listened to this album, the only songs that got<BR>stuck in my head were &quot;Come with us&quot;(which I consider to <BR>be a Chemical Brothers classic) and &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;(which<BR>is a MAJOR MAJOR teaser, in my personal opinion; I've been<BR>looking for a very long time for a song with a bass line like<BR>the one at the beginning of the song, which said bass line <BR>fades out in like 20 seconds; therefore &quot;Electrobank&quot; still<BR>remains my favourite from this point of view; who knows, <BR>maybe one of the mixes on the &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; single, if <BR>there will be any, will &quot;insist&quot; on that super-addictive bass <BR>line).
0446678430|2.0|This book repeats itself so many times it becomes an annoyance. The book could have been written in about 50 pages. Really the mantra is: Own a business or real estate or stocks. Being  employed is bad. Yep, got all that. It does manage to make you think about how truly aweful it is to be an employed toady, but like most books of this ilk there is very little there to help you get started. It read like a multi-level marketing meeting.
6303257844|5.0|\\"Speed\\" is a frenetic action thriller that far surpasses all of the action movies you've ever seen-kinetic energy, electrically charged screenplay (which is helped by fully fleshed-out characters) and is suspenseful from the beginning to the last few minutes.<br />Keanu Reeves plays a SWAT team memeber trapped on a city bus with a handful of compassionate passengers and a woman who got a ticket for speeding (Sandra Bullock). The movie gets complicated when the madman bomber (Dennis Hopper) who has installed a bomb that will go off if the bus doesn't surpass 50 m.p.h. if his demands aren't met within a couple of hours.<br />The movie is superb-in it's cinematography and sound editing (which it rightfully snatched an Oscar for the sound editing), superb dialogue, fine score, and the utter simplicity of the plot that leads to a satisfying suspense finale in a runaway subway.<br />Avoid the sequel. Even though it has the same director and Sandra Bullock in it, it's downright stupid and the PG-13 rating on it seems to insult the masterpiece that this suspense thriller is.<br />Rated R for violence and language.
B00003CX6P|4.0|First of all the outdoors (and indoors) locations in Italy are good for at least one star from me. Rome, Venice, etc. a pleasure to watch. Unfortunately, watching Damon for over two hours as a slowly unwinding psycho is not pleasant, though his acting is top notch.But the jazz scenes and orchestral score are great too. As far as the Law character (Dickie) goes, even if a caricature, no doubt such smug,shallow types flaunting Daddy's money are everywhere. My question is \\"What did Paltrow's character see in him anyway?\\", but the answer is too obvious. The only truly \\"nice\\" character is the gay Brit who enters the scene at the end. Then again, all the Italians, except the inept police, are poor and happy, compared to the rich and unhappy Americans. There is probably no better example of a manipulative, devious nobody in all of filmdom than Tom Ripley(Damon),though the viewer can even sympathize with him (a little)in the climactic rowboat scene. This is when the \\"thriller\\" effectively begins. And the film does have a mesmorizing, dreamy quality all the way through. Paltrow's is also the only character who can put two and two together, and is great in some of the final scenes...Moral to the story? Stay away from odd, manipulating freeloaders!!
B00000AFDW|5.0|Like most KISS fans, my very favorites are the ones in the 70s with the makeup, s/t, Destroyer, and Alive among them, but the rest being essential to any rock n' roll fan. But unlike so many rock bands, KISS show that they're like fine wine in creating a masterpiece that shows them as the weathered, persistant, hard rockin' good guys that they are!<BR>Easily their best album since Alive II (Trust me, I've heard all the ones in between), the original lineup must bring out something incredible in this band, with each member making solid contributions on this album. The songwriting and musicianship have gotten better, and this album can be seen as a middle finger to all the parents, preachers, and teachers who told us, the KISS Army, that we'd outgrow the hottest band in the world and they'd be forgotten in a few months. But this album shows off a lot of hard work, years of perseverence and incredibly, coming out in top form! Every songs rocks solid (even Peter Criss's number grew on me) and this is not their best album, but easily a definitive and essential one. ...
B00005MP58|5.0|I don't actually own the DVD, yet, but I have seen this movie and it is spectacular.  My friend and I watched it at her house and I am hooked!  You have to watch it again and again!
B000000OUE|5.0|I got this album a couple weeks ago and I really enjoyed it. Much better production than their first album. This reminded me a lot of Pantera. Too bad they're not together anymore. <BR>The Band-<BR>   Zombie, vocals- The infamous frontman, Rob Zombie. Zombie is one amazing vocalist. His low growls are awesome. He was of course the reason why I was drawn to White Zombie. He is one the best vocalists alive. Check out some of his solo stuff if you like his vocals. Oh, also, his artwork in the booklet is great, but a liiiiitttllle on the freaky side, but then again we are talking about Rob Zombie here.<BR>   J, guitar- J was the wonderful guitarist of White Zombie. His riffs are like a mix of Metallica's and Pantera's. He was just plain great. Listen to &quot;Electric Head&quot; and &quot;Super-charger Heaven&quot; and you'll get me. Fast and heavy=J.<BR>   Sean, bass- The only female of the group (and one of the first in the heavy metal genre) and one the best bassists I've heard. She's detuned and very good. She can be easily heard throughout &quot;Astro Creep 2000&quot;.<BR>   John, drums- Even after his days with White Zombie, this great drummer is still in the music business, with acts such as the great Testament. John sounds great on this album. He's got some good percussion sounds in there too. He's very fast with those double bass drums (SCH).<BR>This is a must-buy for any Zombie fan, and is highly recommended for people who like Pantera, Slipknot, Metallica, or just any plain metal head. You'll like it.
B00003CXDG|3.0|As a Bond fan I was looking forward to seeing this action film.  The storyline is very weak (as in Bond).  However the characters seemed very one dimensional and did not interact well and seemed unbelievable at times.  That said the action sequences are very good, just what you would expect.  Loud, in your face, fast and the chase scene at the end is almost like a queue of stuntmen and directorrs all having 3 minutes to outdo each other as the finale becomes more frantic, outrageous and improbable utilising every type of vehicle the production people could get their hands on.<BR>But these scenes are made for DVD to play over and over, and coupled with enough extras to keep even a region 2 fan happy, it has to be said it is value for money.
B000002B7O|5.0|Diary of a Madman is one of the best albums to date. It's just incredible! I mean come on, who can beat a duo as great as Ozzy and Randy (RIP)? This is a very heavy album, and should be in everyone's CD booklet. <BR>The Band-<BR>   The Ozzman, vocals- Ozzy is yet again a groundbreaking vocalist. His vocals aren't beaten by many people. Um....I really can't say a lot about Ozzy that the public doesn't already know!<BR>   Randy, the guitar legend- Randy's guitar riffs were the fastest, heaviest, and most melodic riffs of his time, and I've heard only very few that can rival him. From his heavy riffs and awesome solo on &quot;Over the Mountain&quot; to the haunting melodicness of &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, Randy's guitar is mindblowing. Rest in peace, Randy. <BR>   Rudy, bass- Every album Ozzy makes has an awesome bassist, and Rudy is no exception. Rudy's bass lines are low, well heard, and very creative. <BR>   Tommy, drums- Tommy is one of the best drummers Ozzy has ever made an album with. I love his crazy opening on &quot;Over the mountain&quot; and his percussive sounds on &quot;Tonight&quot;. <BR>  This is a must have album for any person who wants to call themselves a metal head. And that goes for most of Ozzys albums as well. Pick this up now!
B00005QB9A|4.0|Tim Roth gives an excellant portayal as 1900, born on a passenger liner on the first day of the new century.  He grows up in the bowels of the ship until one day he wanders into the ships ballroom and sits down at the piano and plays like a maestro.<BR>The film deals with the people he meets, fleetingly as they reach his destination and his struggle to come to terms with the realisation that there is a big new world at the end of the gangplank.<br />It has the feel of one of the sixties epics, but using the sound and cinematography of the 21st century to create a rich, deep feeling of being on board.  Sometimes the film seems to drag, but as we are brought up on a diet of films with explosions incredible special effects, and quick cut scenes it is refreshing to see a film that is both,interesting and uplifting.  And if you enjoy good music, especially piano you are in for a treat.  Not sure how popular this was in the States but I found it in the bargain DVD bin and haven't yet found anyone who has heard of it.  Watch it, rent it, buy it but sshhh, let's keep it to ourselves.

B00005ATQ8|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's beautifully opulent production takes many liberties with William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque romance, The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq (1843), narrated in the first person depicting events from the eighteenth century.  In particular, Redmond Barry who becomes Barry Lyndon, is something of an admirable rake, whereas in Thackeray's novel he is a braggart, a bully and a scoundrel.  No matter.  Kubrick, in keeping with a long-standing filmland tradition, certainly has license, and Thackeray won't mind.<br /><br />Ryan O'Neal is the unlikely star, and he does a good job, rising from humble Irish origins to the decadence of titled wealth, employing a two-fisted competence in the manly arts, including some soldiering, some thievery at cards and a presumed consummate skill in the bedroom.  Marisa Berenson plays Lady Lyndon, whom Barry has managed to seduce; and when her elderly husband dies, she marries Barry thus elevating his social and economic station in life.  But Barry is rather clumsy at playing at peerage, and bit by bit manages to squander most of the Lyndon fortune until his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) grows old enough to do something about it.<br /><br />This really is a gorgeous movie thanks to the exquisite sets and costumes and especially to John Alcott's dreamy cinematography and a fine score by Leonard Rosenman.  The 184 minutes go by almost without notice as we are engrossed in the rise and fall of Barry's fortunes.  There is fine acting support from Patrick Magee as the Chevalier de Balibari and Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, and a number of lesser players, who through Kubrick's direction bring to life Europe around the time of the Seven Years War (1754-1763) when decadence and aristocratic privilege were still in full flower.<br /><br />The script features two dueling scenes, the first showing the combatants firing at one another simultaneously at the drop of a white kerchief, the second has Barry and his stepson face each other ten paces apart, but due to the flip of a coin, the stepson fires first.  Both scenes are engrossing as we see the loading of the pistols with powder, ball and ramrod, and we are able to note how heavy the pistols are and how difficult it must be to hit a silhouette at even a short distance.  It is this kind of careful attention to directional detail that absorbs us in the action and makes veracious the story.  Notice too the way the British soldiers march directly en mass toward the French guns.  They actually used to fight battles that way!  Also note the incredible pile of hair atop Lady Lyndon's head.  Surely this is some kind of cinematic record.<br /><br />Bottom line: one of Kubrick's best, certainly his most beautiful film.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"[...]\\"art, but due to the flip of a coin, the stepson fires first.

B00005AR3G|4.0|Well, it's Disney, so it can't go too wrong even as a piece of lightweight fluff.  I read a review of the movie that said it was originally intended to be a far more complex &quot;quest&quot; epic, but it was scaled back partway into production.  Watching the film, you can totally picture the director saying, &quot;Forget all that stuff, just make it funny.&quot;  The result is a bunch of the most mono-dimensional characters you've ever seen running around doing completely improbable things, but so what?  It makes for a hilarious ride.<br />Warning to parents:  Kuzco's (the emperor/llama) behavior is SO over-the-top that it will inspire endless imitative behavior in most kids.  They will run around the house making you crazy by saying &quot;Boom baby!&quot; and &quot;Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh&quot; a million times.  The film's message, of course, is that snotty, selfish Kuzco eventually learns to care about others, but it is so thinly presented that the kids will mostly just remember the sarcastic &amp; snide things that Kuzco says for the first 99% of the film.<br />In all:  Not Disney's best, but fun, light entertainment for the kids.
6305807086|5.0|I remember first hearing about \\"Being John Malkovich\\" more than a year before it was released to theatres.  At that time it was just a title, a concept, and a guarantee that Malk (and Cusack) would be involved.  Stunned at the bravado and imagination, I couldn't wait to buy tickets.  Sadly, sometimes anticipation ruins the result, and I left the theatre disappointed, if not a little bored.<br />Having recently seen the movie again, I found myself enjoying it immensely, buying in to its eclectic concept and execution wholeheartedly, while holding a silly smile on my face the whole time.  This second experience leads me to a conclusion that dovetails nicely with one of the film's major themes: I'm not the same person now as I was then.<br />Director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman realize their vision with exuberance and melancholy, which, although paradoxical emotions, make an easy fit together.  Kaufman's script cares not for the rules of the physical world or sane human behaviour.  This apathy allows him to go down roads other screenwriter's have not the talent or the courage to travel.  Jonze, he who cut his teeth on Beastie Boy, Weezer, and Fatboy Slim videos and who's iconoclastic vision reminds one favourably of his musical namesake, achieves Kaufman's vision so sublimely you'd think the two men sprung from the same artistically fertile womb.  They could have made a perfectly banal movie, and only included the marionette sequences, and it still would have been fascinating.  Throw in the 7 1/2-floor orientation video, Dr. Lester and his deaf receptionist, the ingenious celebrity cameos, and the 'Dance of Despair and Disillusionment', and you've got yourself a unique and fascinating vision.  Top it all off with the stunning \\"What happens when a man goes through his own portal\\" scene (where the word 'Malkovich' loses all meaning), and I can't think of a way they could have improved this movie.<br />(Re-reading the above paragraph, it's amazing to think that not two hours ago I would have called anyone who'd written such rubbish a frantic imbecile; ah, how quickly the tune can change when the orchestra is given time to practice&#8230;)<br />John Cusack is miles away from Lloyd Dobler country, and yet he still manages to hit the role on the sweet spot.  His Craig is an open wound, festering from lack of love and attention.  Cusack makes him uncomfortable to watch, which is a neat trick because Johnny boy's roles usually go down smoothly.  Like the rest of the actors here, he subverts his own persona (and others'; he's a puppeteer, natch), in a movie about subverting personae.<br />Others themes to watch for (and this is by no means an exhaustive list), include the meaning of the individual and the self, loneliness, obsession, genius, unrequited love, existentialism, capitalism, ethics, morality, celebrity, theology, immortality, passion, art, the tortured artist, vanity, inspiration, and of course, fractional numbers.  It tackles all the big themes, and it tackles them hard.<br />Why is Cameron Diaz in this movie? I asked myself upon first viewing.  Why bring her aboard, and then waste the one reason why you would cast Cameron Diaz, i.e., because she looks like Cameron Diaz!  Putting her in a fright wig, and never letting her near the shower just seemed counterproductive.  Well, on further review, she actually does a fine job in both creating her character and subverting her glamorous Cameron Diaz persona.  She shows longing and frustration, and then ecstasy with ease, and is able to pull off some of the deadpan absurdity that Lotte's dialogue requires.<br />Catherine Keener proves that if you need someone to play a sexy ice queen, then she's your girl.  Ratcheting up a notch her work as a similar character in \\"Your Friends and Neighbors\\", Keener is a vital life force, giving energy and vitality to a film peopled with losers and freaks (that's the film's message, not just my opinion).  Whenever she's onscreen, youfear for your life in the audience, for she just might lash out through the screen and slap you where you sit without blinking an eye.  But, she's also able to sincerely play the more emotional moments, without believability and vulnerability.  I love watching this classy lady on film.  More Keener please!<br />Malkovich himself pulls off the film's best acting, especially when he has to portray what happens while Craig is inside his skull.  It's a trick that Cage/Travolta tried to pull off, without success, in \\"Face/Off\\".  Here, Malk and Cusack form a superior tandem (having worked together previously in \\"Con Air\\"; that's not the jewel thief movie everyone is talking about, is it?).  Malk details Cusack's mannerisms with spot-on accuracy.  But there are other moments where Malk mocks himself, his celebrity, and his supposed lifestyle.  Scenes showing him earnestly rehearsing \\"The Cherry Orchard\\" and \\"Richard III\\", greeting obtuse fans who praise him for his sensitivity in playing \\"retards\\", or passionately ordering bathroom towels from a mail order catalog not only subvert his persona, but deconstruct it, and then deconstruct it again.  This movie wouldn't have worked if Malkovich had no sense of humour about himself (His advice to Spike Jonze upon taking the role: 'The crueler the better'; \\"Being Tom Cruise\\", while probably a bigger ticket, wouldn't have packed the same punch).  Kudos to him for getting, and running with, the joke.<br />[The DVD is loaded with quirky video pieces, such as the entire orientation video and Malkovich-as-puppeteer documentary, both featured in the movie; plus, it has an odd behind the scenes look at one of the extras driving along the Jersey Turnpike, and a mock interview with Spike Jonze that's a dirty gag in more ways than one]
B00005QZ7U|3.0|...I honestly didn't feel that the film contained the amount of depth that it could have held quite easily.<br />Ewan McGregor is brilliant in his role as Christian whose idyllic outlook is bombarded by the excess and debauchery of the outside world.  His innocent demeanour is captured wonderfully in each screen shot; especially in one scene where he mistakes sexual overtones for serious conversation.  He puts a lot of heartfelt longing into every scene and his singing talent is astounding to say the least and Nicole Kidman is a fairly good vocalist as well.<br />But it ends there, sadly.  Art is substituted by frenetic editing and the sense of being \\"overwhelmed\\" is not so much about what is encapsulated in an image during a scene, but the limited time that you have to see it.  Chaotic?  Ok, I sensed that...over and over and over until I felt like speaking up by shouting, \\"All right, I get it.  Please move on.\\"  The scene involving the Duke's realization behind the musical farce mirroring his own experience was so weakly reminiscent of a similar scene in Hamlet--though unintentional--that it made me wonder if there was much in the way of ORIGINAL thought in this film.  Okay, admittedly the use of modern pop music as dialogue in this film is clever, but it was written by others!  I can sit in a library and pull out 100 unrelated books, pull out quotes, and make a movie by stringing these quotes along in a maddening, dizzying spiral of unrelated sentiment.  Some may think that's unfair, but it's TRUE.<br />All the other characters in the film were grotesque to the point that it's no wonder that Satine and Christian appear to be perfectly normal people.  It's like holding gold up next to mud, really; and another example where excess can feel like a hammer to the face as opposed to the \\"subtlety\\" that others imply or state in other reviews.<br />However, 3 stars...given the film's flaws, it still remains in its own right a very different film.  Guaranteed, though, thatyou will not see its like again.  ....
B00005UW7V|5.0|i recomend to see this movie to everyone.just open your heart.that's all! try to understand the message! its not some kind of stupid action movie.its a story about little robot-boy who's trying to understand human's nature,human's mind.its shows bad & good size of it.i'm very sentimental person,so its makes me cry while watching this movie.if you want to see something more emotional & intelligent.this one is must.one of the best movies i ever saw!
B00003CX8I|5.0|But i have a few things about Amazon.com's trivia things.  First off Magneto's name is actually Erik \\"Magnus\\" Leisher.  So they werent wrong.  Second off the boy playing with fire in the classroom scene was actually Jonathan Pryor a.k.a. Pyro.  Not Johnny Storm a.k.a. The Human Torch.  In the comic books Jubilee is Wolverines best friend.  Not Rogue.  Rogue's name is unknown in the comic books.  Mystique is Rogues mother in the comic books.  Rogues love interest in the comic books is Gambit who would of been great if featuered heree.  But anywho.  Yeah those were just somethings i thought id point out.  PEACE!
0792842073|5.0|Dead Man Walking really takes the viewer into a situation where they experience life and death first hand. It's a rare glimpse of how violence affects us all. Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn both give powerful performances. It's really an unforgettable movie.
B00003CXAT|4.0|I saw the movie on opening day, I bought the Laser Disc version and now have the DVD. This movie is a classic adventure of the century. People on a quest being onset and amazed by dinosaurs of another era. Beware the velociraptors but it's the Tyranosauras Rex that'll get ya in the end! The special features are a blast too!
B00000DFTH|5.0|I saw black sabath play live in the summer of 1999. I was really amazed at how well the band played toghether. It was just an amazing feeling to see them play live. Reunion helps to capture that experience. The live show in their hometown really shows how far the band has come since it early days as musical outsiders with their first album in 1969.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This disk is the absolute best work I have ever heard from DT. Do not hesitate to buy it. It is an absolute masterpiece!!! The original members are incredible, and the addition of Jordan has made them the most incredible band Ive ever heard!! Get this Disk, It's money well spent!!!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|If you love Sade, you've heard all the songs on this CD a million times before...but NEVER like this! This CD is outstanding...I expected it to be good, but it far surpassed my expectations. If you love Sade, you MUST buy this CD!
B00005JKJA|5.0|The depth of emotion Lynch attains in Mulholland Drive is both unprecedented and stunning. The possibility of classic tragedy may be long long lost to us, but Lynch,  embedding time and spatial dislocations throughout Mulholland's narrative, achieves a poetic alchemy in which a newly invented dimension of the tragic emerges from the cosmic wormholes that cascade through the film's partitioned structure. Frankly, I can think of no film that narrates emotion as this does, as if through a veil of tears with a little string theory thrown in. Quite Extraordinary!
1565847032|5.0|There are a great number of Chomsky's works in print, but this carefully edited book of lectures and discussions is both an excellent introduction and an insightful contribution to the Chomsky corpus. Mitchell and Schoeffel must have worked on this collection for many years, finding and editing exemplary exchanges and discussions, and then providing a set of footnotes ... the depth of which surpasses that found in any of Chomsky's previous political works. That this may be the first time in the history of modern publishing that a book and a web site have been used to such extraordinary effect only adds to the achievement.
B000000H7I|2.0|Extremely boring, lame and overrated... that's what I think of when I hear the word \\"Suffocation\\". While I don't think they ever were abysmally bad, they just don't deserve all the praise they're getting even after all those years. Tell me, why would anybody really, REALLY wanna listen to this... I mean, it's so repetitive and boring. Every Song sounds the same...
B00003CXZ4|1.0|this movie is based on a cool concept and<BR>you would think it would be really good.<BR>However, it is the most boring movie i have<BR>ever seen.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Who's not seen the Terminator? This is a good transfer. Only thing missing is a commentary, but why should we assume these guys always want to do one? They don't need to, unlike poor Dustin Hoffman in &quot;The Sphere&quot;.<br />The Terminator will always stand for the concrete and steel in us all. Thank the Lord it was made before the current cleaned up morals.
B00005V9QJ|3.0|The artist Sade is one of a kind.  Her sultry singing and the elegance of her music are very appealing, but her first live CD is nothing remarkable.  This disc doesn't add anything at all to her previous recordings. The band plays well and Sade's singing is reasonably good, but these live versions just aren't special in any way.  The older songs such as \\"Smooth Operator\\" are done in a rather perfunctory or even lackluster fashion. There actually is one other live release from Lady Sade, the video-only \\"Sade Live\\" from 1994.  That concert seemed livelier than this, but then that was visual and Lovers Live is just audio -- at least for now.  A DVD release of Lovers Live is scheduled for release in two weeks.  (I'm not sure why it wasn't put out at the same time as the CD.)  The new Lovers Live DVD will have 22 songs versus this CD's 13, plus various DVD-only extras.  I strongly recommend waiting for the DVD and passing on this CD.
6305842442|4.0|The present DVD release of this movie is a very cheap and cheerful affair, with plenty of dirt specks, extra grain and poor contrast; not worth having, and not that much better than a VHS copy. It hasn't got 5.1 sound or any special features.<br />What always annoyed me about this \\"Director's Cut\\" is that it is missing some very satisfying extra bits in the violent scenes which I've only seen once (in a pre-directors cut screening at a local cinema) which are as follows and which greatly affect the scenes they are in:<br />1.  Where Roy Batty crushes Tyrell's head, there are some extra bits of him pushing his fingers in. Sounds crude, but the scene plays a lot better and is no more gruesome.<br />2.  When Roy is trying to stay alive by pushing a nail through his hand, there's a bit more of the nail going in. This is very squeamish but again the scene works better.<br />3.  The most annoying omission: Pris' dancing attack on Deckard is AT LEAST TWICE AS LONG and WORKS WAY BETTER! In the usual version, she drops him to the floor, does one run up and is shot dead. Very tame! In the never-to-be-seen-again version, she attacks him much more convincingly, and her death scene is also longer and much creepier, with her extra-weird android screaming and wriggling up the walls!<br />Surely Ridley Scott would have wanted these bits kept? They aren't as \\"strong\\" as many things I have seen, and this is an adult-rated movie anyway. I won't believe any more hype about Director's Cuts until someone explains this to me.<br />A special new edition, hopefully properly transferred, is coming along soon. I'm assuming it will still be incomplete. I almost wish I hadn't seen the better version. Where is it? Somebody else tell me they've seen it too, please.
0399230033|5.0|My youngest isn't the type to sit and have a book read to her (she can't sit still long enough), but she asks to have THIS book read to her 4 or 5 times a day.  The illustrations are great (especially when the zookeeper's wife realizes she is no longer alone in her bedroom), and both of my kids (ages 6 and 3) get a big kick out of the gorilla.  It's the perfect book for little ones: simple text, silly illustrations, and just the right size for little hands.  :o)
B00005V0X5|5.0|Alot of people never got into Killing is my Business because of the production flaws , but this remastered edition brings the entire album to life.  Dave Mustaine's voice sounds incredibly clearer , and it is much easier to hear the drumming of Gar Samuelsson , who happens to be whom the album is dedicated to.  The highlights of this album are Mechanix , Skull Beneath The Skin , and Looking Down The Cross , among others. All these songs have a completely different sound to them on the remastered version.  Also , you'll find some comedy on the album. Dave's cover of \\"These Boots\\" , which of course was taken off the original Killing is my business because of copyright issues , is back on this album. The only problem is that the original song write Lee Hazelwood did not allow Dave to use many of the obscene lyrics in his version. Dave has put the song on the album with the majority of the lyrics bleeped out. It is hilarious to listen to the song.  As if that isn't enough , you get Megadeth's 3 demo songs from 1983.  These have a raw power to them , they sound tremendous , although the quality is not that good , Dave did not have a good tape of these recordings to use. Anyways , I'm sure every Megadeth fan has already bought this album. If you haven't bought it , it's worth your $..
B00005UV96|4.0|I have to admit that this album wasnt quite what I expected.  It is a lot dancier than previous albums (yes, even more so than Surrender)but rest assured Chemz fans, it is pulled  off with a technical fervor that only Tom and Ed could do.  First things first, the entire album is excellent, there is no song that any fan will skip (I can attest to this because it has been in my cd player for the past 7 days on loop).  I was never a HUGE fan of the first single \\"It began in Afrika\\" mainly because the vocal cut was repeated to many times.  The Chemz, as always, fixed that little problem and now the song kicks...  I really dont understand what everybody is whining about saying that the album doesnt seem very congealed because it all flows very well.  I think everybody is just looking at the fact that DYOH won a grammy so therefore it must be the best thing they've ever done.  I may sound blasphemous here but I put DYOH as my least favorite album, granted it had some amazing tracks and was still vere, very good, but I think that it is the least congealed of their albums.  Come on people make reviews based on actually LISTENING to the albums, not what everybody else says!  I say that Come With Us is superb, albeit a slight change for the Chemz, but overall worth every penny just like very album they've ever produced.  Any buyer will be extrmely pleased.
6300274268|1.0|I recieved within a week, however it was not the movie I ordered &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; the classic cartoon, and recieved &quot;the movie&quot; that was made it 1999 and directed by Nick Willing, not Kathryn Beaumont. I was disapointed, since it was a movie for my daughter.
B000002ILG|4.0|White Lion released this album a few years after I was really into hard rock/metal.  &quot;When the Children Cry&quot; was a song that has stuck with me for years, so I had to buy the album.  There are 2 other songs that are good too, &quot;Hungry&quot; and &quot;Lonely Nights&quot;.  For a metal band, their guitar work is tight, back-up vocals are clean, but the lead singer is average.  On some of the songs it's hard to decipher what he is actually saying-maybe this is on purpose?  All and all, it's a pretty good album for fans of '80s rock.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is my favorite movie of all time.  It was a great love story with a great amount of comedy and suspense.  I became so involved with all the characters.  You begin to hate some, and totally love other characters.  I think I cried the hardest at this movie than any other movie I've seen.  They chosed great songs to make what they were saying all the more meaningful.
B000001DZM|4.0|I purchased this CD for just one song, and that was &quot;Never Been To Me&quot;-Charlene.  It's the only CD that this song is available on. There are a few other songs like &quot;Shake Your Groove Thang&quot;-the 12&quot;disco verson (rare!), and different mixes of &quot;I love the Nightlife&quot;-Alicia Bridges.  The rest of the album was a bit of dissapointment, but the other songs make up for it.  Maybe if I saw the movie I would have liked this soundtrack, but it is just average to me.
0790736039|5.0|This movie is one of the best horror flicks I have ever seen.  I read the book first and found it to be suspensful, but extremely long(1093 pages in Signet Classic).  The only disappointing part about the movie was that it left out The Ritual of Chud, which was the biggest part in the book.  The acting was fairly good.  Tim Reid is probably the only person who could portray Mike Hanlon better than any other actor.  Tim Curry does an excellent job as Pennywise the Dancing Clown otherwise known as &quot;It&quot;.  The best Stephen King movie and book of all time.
0789723107|5.0|Steve knows how to be brief. One of his points is something like \\"Remove 50% of the words.\\" (I've borrowed the book now so I can't verify). But on some cases his briefness makes this book look like it lacks some content, especially compared to Jakob Nielsen's books.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Everyone should hear this CD at least once. I am amazed every time I hear it and think how a young man like him could convey so many life experiences in a short span of time.  Who was 2Pac really? He must have known he was exiting this world, probably to return in some other form - but exactly how, no one is sure.  When it happens we'll all know it.  One last thing, to call this CD west coast or gangsta rap doesn't seem to do it justice.  Somehow it rises above all that and all you can picture in your head is one very serious individual that some people may not want to come back.
B00005RDCA|5.0|We all know that Surrealistic Pillow is a landmark album. The question is where can I find a decent sounding CD of this essential album? We suffered for more than ten years with the first generation CD - a notoriously bad CD plagued by hiss and crummy mastering. No surprise, RCA showed the same disregard for the Elvis CDs for years until his estate finally stepped in and said enough is enough - suddenly the original masters started showing up and now remastered Elvis sounds great. Will the same good fortune happen to Surrealistic Pillow? Well, there was the expensive Gold disc a few years ago. It sounded better, and even included the mono along with the stereo mixes (22 tracks), but virtually anything would have been an improvement! The problem was that the Gold disc lacked any depth whatsoever, it sounded very flat - and on top of that it had an edgy, harsh treble quality whenever the music got louder. Oh, well... Then a box set came out that included a slightly less harsh sounding Surrealistic Pillow that also had both stereo and mono versions. But again, the basic problems remained - a one-dimensional soundstage, a still too-harsh high-end, and muddied vocals, not to mention that, like the Gold disc, it was going to cost you some major bucks to buy the whole box to get this one disc. And remember, throughout this whole time RCA had continued to mass produce that first generation CD without remastering it - forcing you to either buy the Gold disc or the box to get better sound. Are you starting to get the picture here? Frustrating! Anyway, FINALLY last year (2001) a new single CD was issued domestically and it turns out to be exactly the same as the remastered one in the box set (includes both stereo and mono tracks). Same sound problems, but at least now you can get it without having to buy the whole box. But, that's not all folks! There is more to the story. There was also a new European import CD issued in 2001 with 4 bonus tracks (no mono tracks) that actually sounds ALMOST as good as my LP copy from the 70's, which of course isn't saying much. In any case, for what it is worth, this is by far the best re-issue CD I have heard. My advice is that if you need to get the best sound, then get the import. I can listen to this import CD without cringing and actually enjoy the experience. The remastering on the import is very faithful to the original LP mix (unlike the domestic issue) and on some songs it has some of that warm three-dimensional presence that all the other domestic CDs lack. Now I am not saying this is a fantastic CD, only that it finally begins to approach the minimal quality that you might expect from this great album. Be forewarned that even this import CD still is harsh at times, but it is far, far less annoying than the domestic versions. Let's just say Surrealistic Pillow needs to be totally remixed from top to bottom from the first generation four-track master instead of the worn out two-track Stereo mix-down master to do it justice. Until that happens, get the import CD and skip all domestic issues or better yet dig out that old LP and give it a spin.sounds ALMOST as good as my LP copy from the 70's, which of course isn't saying much.

B000002UAC|2.0|Ha!  It even happened to the best!  The Beatles, as many pop groups do, could not match their debut masterpiece.  Pound for pound this is a lightweight album (in length and depth of material).  The no. 1 reason is that the group had years of club playing in Hamburg to develop their early stuff that stood toe to toe with the covers of American Rock and Roll they could play in their sleep.  And... they picked the cream of the crop of those covers for the first album.  WTB's only show stoppers are Till There Was You &amp; Money (although George's Roll Over Beethoven really shows that once his heart belonged to Rock &amp; Roll).  Most of their original orginals had already been released as singles (or the first LP).  By the time WTB was released, Mr. Lennon &amp; Sir McCartney had already written:  Please Please Me, I Saw Her Standing There, Do You Want to Know a Secret, From Me to You, She Loves You &amp; I Want to Hold Your Hand.  The only standout originals on WTB are Little Child (an underated Lennon gem) and All My Loving (a Paul classic).  I Wanna Be Your Man was given away to The Stones.  As great as their version is, Ringo does the song justice here with a cool reverb heavy vocal over a rockin' effort by the rest of the band.  <br />Amazingly, the boys rebounded in 1964 and Lennon &amp; McCartney would each develop a unique sound (without yet straying too far from Rock &amp; Roll) at an incredibly prolific pace.  <br />Until Capitol decides to release a best of 1963-64 cd set, you'll need this to complete your collection.

No surprise, RCA showed the same disregard for the Elvis CDs for years until his estate finally stepped in and said enough is enough - suddenly the original masters started showing up and now remastered Elvis sounds great. Will the same good fortune happen to Surrealistic Pillow? Well, there was the [pricey] Gold disc a few years ago. It sounded better, and even included the mono along with the stereo mixes (22 tracks), but virtually anything would have been an improvement! The problem was that the Gold disc lacked any depth whatsoever, it sounded very flat - and on top of that it had an edgy, harsh treble quality whenever the music got louder. Oh, well... Then a box set came out that included a slightly less harsh sounding Surrealistic Pillow that also had both stereo and mono versions. But again, the basic problems remained - a one-dimensional soundstage, a still too-harsh high-end, and muddied vocals, not to mention that, like the Gold disc, it was going to cost you some major bucks to buy the whole box to get this one disc. And remember, throughout this whole time RCA had continued to mass produce that first generation CD without remastering it - forcing you to either buy the Gold disc or the box to get better sound. Are you starting to get the picture here? Frustrating! Anyway, FINALLY last year (2001) a new single CD was issued domestically and it turns out to be exactly the same as the remastered one in the box set (includes both stereo and mono tracks). Same sound problems, but at least now you can get it without having to buy the whole box. But, that's not all folks! There is more to the story. There was also a new European import CD issued in 2001 with 4 bonus tracks (no mono tracks) that actually sounds ALMOST as good as my LP copy from the 70's, which of course isn't saying much. In any case, for what it is worth, this is by far the best re-issue CD I have heard. My advice is that if you need to get the best sound, then get the import. I can listen to this import CD without cringing and actually enjoy the experience. The remastering on the import is very faithful to the original LP mix (unlike the domestic issue) and on some songs it has some of that warm three-dimensional presence that all the other domestic CDs lack. Now I am not saying this is a fantastic CD, only that it finally begins to approach the minimal quality that you might expect from this great album. Be forewarned that even this import CD still is harsh at times, but it is far, far less annoying than the domestic versions. Let's just say Surrealistic Pillow needs to be totally remixed from top to bottom from the first generation four-track master instead of the worn out two-track Stereo mix-down master to do it justice. Until that happens, get the import CD and skip all domestic issues or better yet dig out that old LP and give it a spin.sounds ALMOST as good as my LP copy from the 70's, which of course isn't saying much.

0688172377|4.0|This book is at times incredibly painful, but can also be extremely entertaining. What I particularly liked about it is the fact that although Waris was clearly a victim of terrible abuse and violation, she does not come across as a flawless heroine. Even though the work is ghost-written, her voice seems very clear and her honesty is one of the most impressive things about her. <BR>In a strange way, I felt for her all the more since I knew that at times I did not necessarily side with her. Occasionally I found her morally dubious and hypocritical - not particularly bothered about having used excessive violence and possibly killed the man who tried to rape her (but at least she admits it), very willing to exploit people (but in many ways she had to), overly-impressed with the glitter of the modelling world whilst at the same time insisting that she still loves the simple life (hmm...). She does seem to rank hardship and pain in relation only to her own experiences - when describing how hard life was as nomad she comments on how \\"when I came to the Western world I was amazed to find people complaining.[...] I wanted to say to them \\"Let me give you hard work. You'll never complain about your job again.\\"\\" Later on, however, we are told about what hell being a fashion model in the Western world actually is: \\"Then you're wondering, Why am I doing this? Why am I here?\\" (Call that hard work?, the reader might well wish to cry at this point). I was also a little frustrated by Waris's complaints about being fired for jobs because of her bow legs, \\"the legacy of growing up in a nomadic family without proper nutrition.\\" Being a model is surely all about prejudices based on appearance. Beauty is a standard. I'd never even be offered a job modelling full stop, the legacy of growing up in a Western family where the women seem to stop growing at 5ft...<BR>In spite of this, I really warmed to Waris precisely because her flaws were exposed and this does not detract from her suffering. On the contrary, this shows her as a real person as opposed to a perfect yet faceless sufferer. What was done to her was outrageous. Although I had read about female genital mutilation before (\\"Possessing the Secret of Joy\\") Waris's honesty about the absolute basics eg it's terrible just going to the toilet, made it so much more real and tragic. I admire this woman's courage and truly hope she can do some good. After this website I plan to go on to the one suggested at the end of the book to see what the average person can do to fight this systematic abuse.
0446525537|5.0|This was a great book. I read it in 3.5 hours straight; I couldn't put it down. It's well characterized, well thought out and just plain touching and funny. You laugh, you cry.<br />Great book!

B000002I2I|4.0|In my opinion, this is the second best album the Doors ever made. Other writers have stated that there was more of a blues feel on this record, and that is true, however the Doors certainly did not surrender the melodicism they were known for. There was only one hit on the album, You Make Me Real, which only made #50. This was likely due to the many bans that radio stations had placed upon Doors music in the time period, (from the controversy of Morrison's ignorant and abhorrent stage antics at the now infamous Miami concert). Worthy cuts Roadhouse Blues and Peace Frog have since picked up copious classic rock radio airplay. This album was arguably the most consistent of the Doors releases, because it did not include undeveloped poetry readings, or long and fragmented dramatic pieces. Morrison Hotel is musical from start to finish with no track exceeding four and a half minutes. This may also be Morrison's best overall performance on an album, as he contributed steadily writing or co-writing all the tracks. The bluesy cuts are tracks 1,2,8 and 11, all featuring fine playing from all the musicians, most notably Krieger, who played burning solos when his time came. There are two restful, simplistic, and beautiful ballads in Blue Sunday and Indian Summer, and two highly entertaining sea-shanties, Ship of Fools and Land Ho! This leaves two tracks, Waiting For the Sun, and Queen of The Highway. The former is probably the most intense on the album, building up to a climax, featuring distorted organ from Manzarek, and the latter is very creative in tempo shifts, chord selection, and lyrics. In conclusion, the reason that I feel this album is second best, is because it did not have the eclecticism of the first, though it may be my personal favorite. This is the only album that I see as a complete abandonment of dark themes, and in places, very positive and uplifting. The Doors never made a record quite like this one, therefore, Morrison Hotel is recommended.
0671027344|5.0|I've read this book a countless number of times. Charlie's words are true, emotional and completely genuine. If you're an emo kid like me, you'll love it. I bought it a long time ago before all this stuff was popular and i still cherish that book. It really makes you realize certain things about life and I don't think there's a better book out there.

B00005RJ1U|4.0|I like watching movies with gargoyle/demon-like characters so I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  It had pretty good \\"special effects\\" and left my heart beating fast during some real scary moments.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is into 'fantasy' films--I think you will agree the movie is \\"HORRIFFIC\\" fun!!   =:->=
B00005NWM3|5.0|I bought the CD &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; tonight.  I had previously heard &quot;Never Again&quot;, &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, &amp; &quot;Too Bad&quot; through MP3 downloads, but WOW for 10 songs this CD is awesome.  <BR>Never Again - Hard but keeps me entertained throughout<BR>How You Remind Me - Great catchy tune w/ a soft side too it<BR>Woke Up This Morning - Another great hard tune<BR>Too Bad - Shows their sensitive side BEST SONG ON THE CD!<BR>Just For - Great Hard tune which shows their ability to rock!<BR>Hollywood - Catchy beginning riff that'll have ya singing it all day<BR>Money Bought - Amazing drums &amp; vocals some high powered music!<BR>Where Do I Hide - Guitar just screams like hell!  HELL YEAH!<BR>Hangnail - Fluid throughout the song!<BR>Good Times Gone - Softest tune on the CD still amazing<br />So if you haven't bought the album get it.  The State, Hesher, &amp; Curb were amazing but you ain't heard nothin' yet!!
B00005RHGK|2.0|Now, I decided to buy yhis movie because it seemed decent, and supposedly it was supposed to be a good horror flick. Though somewhat slow in the beginning, the movie had great potential. I will have to emphasize potential. So you have brother and sister driving home from college. Ok, fine. They are chased by this spooky truck. Still ok. They see the truck and a creepy guy outside the church, tossing something in a culver pipe. Hmm, interesting. They obviously go back to explore (wouldn't you?) Ok, after that scene is where my interest in the movie deteriorated. Another twenty minutes, and I was wishing the kids would get killed, because i disliked the characters that much. If you want in a movie: no background, no character development, hoakie bad guy (when you finally saw him up close- not a good idea,) no resolution, and a whole lot of one sided marginal characters, by all means watch this movie.
B00005MNP8|4.0|This is the first Blondie album I ever bought and I enjoy it for its ability to evoke an era and a scene that must have been amazing to be a part of.  My recollection is hazy considering I was like 7 at the time but walking around NYC with this cd on is a pretty cool experience.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I loved this movie came out.  At the time, there was very little CGI, if any, in movies of the time.  The models looked a little cheesey, but not too bad.  Seeing this now, the models look almost comical.  The action is still great, but the advances in movie making really come to mind.
B00005JKED|5.0|Seeing this movie in the theaters sent chills down my spine. This movie has incredible action scenes and enough suspense to keep you guessing until the very end.<BR>I would explain the movie but I don't want to give it away... so here's the cryptic summary:<BR>Ethan Hawke (Jake) is trying to get into the narcotics division of the police force on his way to making detective. The man in charge of the elite narcotics unit: Denzel WA (Alonzo). Alonzo tries to teach Jake how to survive and blend with scum in the streets, but the mystery questio behind it all is: is Alonzo REALLY fighting crime or is he using his powerful position for personal gain? Jake has moral conflictions with Alonzo's methods, but due to Alonzo's high crime-bustin' record Jake does what is asked of him in order to gain his respect. Every man has their breaking point- when will Jake decide enough is enough?<BR>See this movie.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Remember the days, when you used to see videos on MTV for songs you would NEVER here on the radio? I could not believe that MTV not MTV2 actually played a video from a band like this. Thank goodness they did. Well it got me interested and wanting more.<br />I was hooked from the first few strums of the guitar for the song &quot;last night.&quot; So, I decided I needed to hear more and read more about the Strokes. What a refreshing band and sound!<br />If you love good old fashioned rock, you will love this band.
0060278234|5.0|Well, Nix did it again although he didn't quite match Sabriel. I have to admit that the book was very good but i can't but help feel a little let down by Prince Sameth. And Lirael, and i know this sounds shallow but, she gets all the good stuff. I mean come on. Nix sets you all up to see Sameth triumph and fulfill his destiny as the Abhorsen. And throughout the novel he frustrates you by having Sameth act too feeble and wimpy when faced by things of the dead and the tools of the Abhorsen. Nix creates Lirael to be this great person, who has no true fear and whom just sweeps in and is able to do things on a whim. Its kind of the same old, \\"the looser triumphs in the end\\" and i couldn't help but feel that Sameth was swindled and that the book is too one sided. Will there ever be another male Abhorsen? Or at least another one like Sabriel who wasn't so touchy and who didn't rely on a creature for emotional support. Nix needs to get back to the subject of death and fine tune the Abhorsen's skills and how they came to be. Lirael was still good but Sabriel, I feel, puts it to shame. Maybe its just the lack of action in this second book. Sabriel was action packed and so intrigueing. I think i read it in a couple of days. But anyways, Lirael is still definately worth reading, even though the whole Clayr subject gets a little old. If you like Nix as i do, definately get yourself a copy of Shade's Children, what a book, you won't be able to put it down. So to close things up, Lirael was good, Sabriel was amazing, and definately read Shade's Children.
0887307396|4.0|James Collins is a management researcher from Boulder (Colorado) and Jerry Porras is a professor of organizational behavior and change at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. This book is really split up into three parts: (1) An introduction into the research.; (2) The core ideology of visionary companies.; (3) The habits of visionary companies; (4) Methods for implementation.    The authors explain their research methods of this six-year research project into visionary companies. \\"Visionary companies are premier institutions - the crown jewels - in their industries, widely admired by their peers and having a long track record of making a significant impact on the world around them.\\" The authors used the term 'visionary', rather than just 'successful' or 'enduring', to reflect the fact they have distinguished themselves as a very special and elite breed of institutions. In order to compose these visionary companies the authors started with a set of criteria which those companies had to meet: (1) Premier institution in its industry; (2) widely admired by knowledgeable businesspeople; (3) made an indelible imprint on the world in which we live; (4) had multiple generations of chief executives; (5) been through multiple product (or service) life cycles; (6) founded before 1950. With these criteria in mind the authors select 18 visionary companies from a wide range of industries, plus 18 comparison companies (which are not weak or bad companies either).    So what do these visionary companies have in common? They have core ideologies consisting of more than a bunch of nice-sounding platitudes. A visionary company's core ideology consists of core values (\\"The organization's essential and enduring tenets\\") and purpose (\\"The organization's fundamental reasons for existence beyond just making money\\"). But the authors comment that ocre ideology alone cannot make a visionary company. Ultimately, a visionary company is build up from a core ideology complemented with a drive for progress and a preservation of the core complemented with a stimulation for progress.    The authors then turn their attention to the specific methods of preserving the core and stimulating progress that distinguishes visionary companies from the comparison companies. They split these methods up into: (1) Big hairy audaciou goals (BHAGs) (\\"Commitment to challenging, audicious goals and projects toward which a visionary company channels its efforts.\\"); (2) Cult-like cultures (\\"Great places to work only for those who buy in to the core ideology; those who don't fit the ideology are ejected like a virus (preserves the core).\\"); (3)Try a lot of stuff and keep what works (\\"High levels of action and experimentation that produce new and unexpected paths of progress and enables visionary companies to mimic the biological evolution of specias (stimulates progress).\\"); (4) Home-grown management (\\"Promotion from within, bringing to senior levels only those who've spent significant time steeped in the coe ideology of the company (preserves the core).\\"); and (5) Good enough never is (\\"A continual process of relentless self-improvement with the aim of doing better and better, forever into the future (stimulate progress).\\")    In the final chapters the authors provide a summary of the book, which they refer to as the vision framework: Articulating a vision = core ideology (core values and core purpose) + envisioned future (10 to 30 year BHAG and vivid descriptions). There are also some tools to create all these items in this framework. In this 3rd edition there is also 'a message for the new economy' in which the authors conclude that the dot-com craze is based on 'Built to Flip' and not 'Built to Last' ideas. They provide some questions for to check whether your organization is built to last or built to flip. This chapter is a waste paper.    This is a good book into the habits of successful companies, although the habits are somewhat 'soft', and difficult to implement inexisting companies. The biggest criticism McKinsey & Co had on this book: \\"We really love 'Built to Last' here, but unfortunately it's useless. ... all the companies in 'Built to Last' were always great. They were never average. But that's most of the world.\\" As an reply to this criticism Collins has recently written 'Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't' (2001). My greatest criticism on this book is the amount of repetition and therefore I recommend others to go for the e-articles 'Build Your Company's Vision' and 'Turning Goals into Results', both by the authors of this book. I also recommend Jim Collins' latest article 'Level 5 Leadership' (2001) which is based on his latest book 'Good to Great'. This book is written in simple US-English.
B00005QG9J|5.0|There comes a time where bands hit or miss. Incubus here, has hit. When you are good, you are just good, no explanation. This is a great cd, with amazing songs (my personal fav at this time would be 11am) and amazing vibe all around, I say this is a definite must buy.
B000059Z8J|3.0|I grew up with this movie.  I loved it and had to have it in my collection simply for reasons of nostalgia.  However, I was disappointed with the extended length of it.  The added scenes are interesting, but I wish they would have put them in a &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot; category instead of making you watch a 3 hour flick.
0380788624|5.0|I first became aware of Neal Stephenson as a cyberpunk-style sci-fi writer.  I thoroughly enjoyed SNOW CRASH and DIAMOND AGE but wasn't really sure that Stephenson was a great writer.  I know it's unfair, but I was predisposed to consider sci-fi writers to be somehow less talented than \\"serious\\" writers.  After all, sci-fi writers can whip up some deus ex machina magic to get themselves out of a bind, right?  CRYPTONOMICON eliminated any of my doubts as to Mr. Stephenson's abilities.      CRYPTONOMICON requires the reader to be intelligent or at least inquisitive.  It's a big book that requires the commitment that all big books require, namely, that you read it to the end.  In return it delivers an absolutely engrossing story that spans 50 years, 3 generations, 4 continents and one world war.  It  has one of the best characters ever, Bobby Shaftoe, and one of the best systems ever devised for dividing up the remains of a deceased parent's estate.  It tells its story while also expounding on mathematics, computer science, cryptography, engineering and Marines.  In short, it is incredibly witty and smart.  Give it time and you will enjoy it.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|To say that I am thrilled to bits with this live capture of Sade's Lovers Rock concert would be an understatement!!! Adding to my thrill is that Lovers Live is released in Asia at the same time as its US premiere(5 Feb). It seems only European Sade fans must wait until 18 Feb!??<br />Anyway, this album showcases not only the unique voice of the great Nigerian-British chanteuse, it also serves as a platform for the rest of her bandmates to display their immaculate musicanship. Any accusation that Matthewman, Hale, and Denman are only wallpaper flowers who serve as the musical backdrop for Ms Adu's voice is completely dispelled here. They play their hearts out!  <br />Given the long sequence of songs (17+) she has to perform in a single evening, Sade's voice manages to retain  remarkable uniformity of breadth, communicativeness and suppleness. You never get the feeling that she is at the end of a tether. The appreciative audience also plays a star role in this album, their hoots and applauses really add to the excitement of the occasion. The standout tracks are \\"Cherish the Day\\", \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\", \\"Paradise\\"(WOW, it really rocks!), \\"No Ordinary Love\\" and of course, \\"Is It A Crime\\". This last track is alone worth the price of admission --- Sade truly gives this ultimate torch song her all. If you aren't moved by this electrifying performance, please check your pulse!<br />In all, this album is a must-have for any Sade fan. <BR>And for non-fans who contend that Sade's music is lifeless and dull, well, they had better take note of this incredible CD!<br />Five Stars All The Way!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|Recently I had to take a long walk somewhere at night, and I decided it would be &quot;neat&quot; to listen to this album on my headphones on the way there and back. Well, I got more than I bargained for. Something about the night sky, the mix of 19th and mid 20th century architecture, and the sound of this album produces an eerie effect that I just can't describe.  During &quot;The National Anthem&quot; I felt chills go down my spine. Kid A gives us a look at the future, and not a very bright one at that. There are moments on this album where the deep human passion of what you're hearing is overwhelming (The National Anthem), and other moments where human beings don't even seem to exist in this futuristic soundscape (Kid A, Idioteque). But beyond these grandiose feelings and concepts, the music itself is quite special and unique. Traditional song structures are thrown out for the most part, giving the songs a bit of a Jazz impulse to them--free from constraints of pop music. At times it's arrythmic (Everything in Its Right Place), at times it's dischordant (horns in &quot;The National Anthem&quot;), but somehow every beat and every note feels like it belongs. Of course I'm saying this having listened to this album countless times, but I think something that sounds better every time you hear it has to be pretty special. Even with all its greatness and critical acclaim, Kid A still has a hushed, understated quality that takes a while to appreciate. First-time listeners may not think much of this album, and that's OK; the first time I heard it it was too much for me to absorb, and I had to put it down for a few weeks before I tried it again. But once you really listen to this album, it becomes very special to you. Give it a chance.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay really hit the spot on this outing. A great album, and great songs. Each song has a great out look on life. It took me awhile to get used to this cd, but, the more I listened, the more the album grew on me. It is now good enough to say, 5/5. Also, make this a side note, Coldplay is way better than Radiohead. I bought albums by both at the same time, and listened to each equally. While each took some time to get used to, Coldplay's recent release is way way way better than Radioheads recent release (Amnesiac). Read my other reviews to see what I have to say about Radiohead. But as for Coldplay, vocals, songwritting, and music all have a likeable feel to them. I rate it a 4.5 out of 5.0.
B00005QIPH|3.0|This album is titled so aptly that it almost scares me.  For months, I had heard the hype about The Strokes (the supposed saviors of rock &amp; roll).  So I bought the CD, listened to it in my car, and thought, &quot;Huh?&quot;<BR>Honestly, admit it to yourself that they aren't that good.  I mean, they serve their purpose.  They're something different, so that's inherently good I suppose.  But, just because they're different from the stuff that's out today doesn't mean that they're being new and inventive.  I mean, come on, this records sounds like an old Rolling Stones LP.  Complete with analog recording.  For those who are nostalgic of the warm buzz in the background, then this album is perfect for you.  I, however, happen to think that The Strokes are to the Rolling Stones what Oasis was to The Beatles.<BR>And one last thought.  I'm sure that all these songs took them a very long time to record, but couldn't they have at least thought of some way to change up that effect they put on the lead singer's voice?  And while we're on the subject of vocals, the slightest bit of harmonizing might have been nice.  But, who am I to judge?  They're the ones with the huge recording deal, right?
6303257844|4.0|In many ways 'Speed' was a surprise hit.  The director wasn't big-league, the leads were relative unknowns and it was original, something that unfortunately can mean the kiss of death for several good movies out there.  Basically, this is an absolutely gob-smacking movie that will grip you from the very beginning.  The central plot revolves around a bomb on a bus that will blow if the bus goes below 50 miles per hour.  Jack (Reeves) is the cop on the bus that has to work a way out of the situation before the bus runs out of petrol, whilst partner Jeff Daniels is on the trail of Dennis Hopper's terrorist.  On the bus is feisty passenger Sandra Bullock, who gets behind the wheel after something happens to the driver.<br />The movie manages to grab hold of its audience's attention from the beginning with a scene involving a lift full of passengers that it just about to go careening to the bottom floor.  Yet it's the story with the bus that is truly a masterstroke in holding the viewer.  We feel the heightened panic alongside the bus passengers and scream, cover our eyes and jump when they do.  The winning script was almost completely written by an (uncredited) Joss Whedon, who proves that his excellence expands beyond 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'.<br />In addition to this, 'Speed' is held together with an absolutely stellar performance from Sandra Bullock as panicky Annie.  She manages to keep the audience alongside her whilst perfectly pulling off her act as an ordinary person stuck in a nightmarish situation.  Also, Keanu Reeves is backed up by this and his bland depiction of the hero fades into the background.  Although the movie does tend to go a little bit too far towards the end, there's no denying that it's a powerfully gripping movie that is well worth seeing.
0446525537|5.0|A walk to remember is a fantastic book.  When I saw the previews for the movie I decided that I had to read the book first, and I'm glad that I did.  It was a beautiful book; it gave you all the emotions that a good book should.  You'll laugh, cry, and all of the other stuff you do in good books.  <BR>The book was well written and Nicolas Sparks really knows how to tug at your heart.  It provides a christan message that you don't find in many books today, which just adds to its charm.  I recommend this book.
0060001941|5.0|Having just moved to Brooklyn my mother thought that I should read this book. The book arrived two days after my arrival, so after a long day of dish boxes I sat down and began to read. Several days later with few boxes unpacked I finsihed the book and loved every word. The adventure is amazing. This book is well written and has reason for being such a classic.  The forward is terrific.  This is a book for every shelf and should be cherished and shared.<BR>Read it soon.
B00003CXI1|4.0|There had been a lot of talk over this movie. My son has read the first 4 novels and we have seen the movie. It does have magic in it but it is good v/s evil. And good wins. I do not beleive this movie is \\"of the devil\\" as I had been told. We are a Christian family. This is a wonderful story in a make beleive world. Just like Peter Pan. It's a fairy tale. Think back to all the tale's told when we were kids, they all have magic in them. Why do people get so upset over this movie? It's just \\"modern day\\" fairy tale.

B000001Y79|5.0|This was the album which made it big for No Doubt, and it deserved to do well.  Spawning the hit singles 'Don't Speak', 'Just A Girl' and 'Spiderwebs', the former has entered into modern classic status.  It shows a wide variety of musical styles, meaning it appeals across the borders, with Gwen Stefani's vocals simply being out of this world.<br />No Doubt manage to do what many bands before them have failed to - write contemplative, angry and almost sad songs to punchy rhythms and not sound ridiculous.  Each track is quirky and original, with insightful comments of the old topic of relationships gone wrong or vice versa, particularly on standout 'Hey You'.  Whilst maintaining their roots, No Doubt have produced a pop record of epic proportions, sounding fresh and original.  Although there are several songs here that probably deserve special comment, yet 'Don't Speak' is absolutely outstanding, with yearning vocals that don't pass over into sappiness.  However, my favourite track would have to 'Spiderwebs', a success in the very fact that it crosses over with pop and a more alternative stlye.  The band's songwriting, vocals and powerfully persuasive image helped 'Tragic Kingdom' to become a roaring success.  It's bouncy, fun and different and a definite album to treasure.<br />If you enjoyed this, chances are you'll also like their other albums, all of which are superb.
0783229526|1.0|First of all, I expected to like this movie.  I loved the book, I think Depp is one of our best young actors, I was in Las Vegas at the time the book was being written, I admire Terry Gilliams's visual techniques, etc.  But ...<br />This was one of the worst movies I have ever sat through, on every level.  Flashy visual effects and snippets of decent period music don't make up for a one-trick pony plot, seemingly off-the-cuff improvised acting, mumbled &quot;dialogue,&quot; endless closeups of wrecked rooms and people and the detritus amongst them.  It was painful to watch this movie, and at the end of it<BR>(blessed relief!) I wished that I had spent two hours doing something more meaningful, like watching Batman &amp; Robin TV reruns.
B000000993|5.0|This is another masterpiece by Tool. It is probably the most \\"Dark\\" album, and I actually think it is their worst album but it still gets 5 stars and I still like every song on the album. The 2 singles are the best in my opinion, (Prison sex and Sober) but I also enjoy 4 Degrees, Undertow, and Intolerance. When you first hear \\"Flood\\" you will wonder what the heck you're listening to but then the song really gets going after 4 minutes. If you like Tool's recent stuff be sure not to miss out on Undertow.
