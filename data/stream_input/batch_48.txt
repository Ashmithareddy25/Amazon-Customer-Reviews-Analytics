B006DUJSD6|5|A Ok
B00AG39RRS|5|Part arrived 2 days before it was supposed to very pleased
B007O1XBQS|5|They work well.<br />@12 v each draws between 12-16 MA.<br />This is dependent an the actual value of the resistor attached to the led.<br /><br />They will work at a lower voltage as well, I paralled 50 of them off a 9.6v rc battery
B00VJMOR66|5|I like it enough that I'm also buying the cup holder and instrument display chrome offered with it.
B00TWEA6ZE|5|LOOKS GREAT ON MY WINDOW SIGN
B000KYYMKK|5|Was just as they said it was
B00E60R8FK|1|I received the Lund Summit Ridge running boards and both were damaged in the form of multiple dents along the length of the boards. They are made of aluminum and seem flimsy which make them highly prone to being easily dented or damaged.
B00KTIAREM|5|Great works excellent!!!!#
B00NGHLY4U|5|Excellent product, extremely easy replacement after watching youtube.  Saved $60-$70 doing it myself.
B00KTJ8D38|4|Yup working great..
B005C2OK3O|5|Loved it !¡I would buy another fast shipping😊
B000CF3W7G|5|perfect fit. high quality

B00X9VUVXS|5|nice
B00H47G81C|5|JUST AS I EXPECTED . WORKS PERFECT!
B00GN1EVI2|1|I was going to keep my iPhone in while driving but it doesn't have a flat back (it's actually warped) and won't stick properly to any surface. Not sure now what to do with it now.
B00330AMYS|5|Wowwy, great product
B000GV5O9A|5|works
B00Y1HUH5G|5|worked perfectly cost me $9.00 to get cut and programmed for free 30 bucks for two keys and Walmart wanted 60 bucks a piece for them
B00H1I639Q|5|Excellent product.
B00KTIUG5C|5|works great took 30 seconds to program both using the provided instructions
B004XWLOOW|5|cfr is fantastic always ,
B003721CC8|2|Helps diminish the bouncing going on back there (I have both a Curt hitch as well as a Curt bike rack).  But it's fiddly to use, and something that other hitch/rack manufacturers don't mandate.  So while I use it (partially to avoid voiding Curt's warranty), if I had to do it again I might select a different hitch and rack manufacturer--one that doesn't make a bike rack that rattles around in its hitch so much.
B002BHWZFI|1|Doesn't help with fog on sports goggles.
B003NDXJ04|5|wrong one but i will find a use for it
B004NBDCHK|4|I bought this shower head to replace the old one in my camper.  It installed quickly and easily and was as expected, plastic, for our RV.  I don't love it, as it really is super cheap feeling, but it does match all of the other faucets in my camper, so I'm happy enough.
B00PKZWSLO|4|I enjoy these
B00DD0ZWQQ|5|Love them and very heavyweight n do the job well!!!
B003TNBD1K|5|Awsome
B004WDPU56|5|Best looking keychain I've seen in a while. I just had to have it for my bike's key.
B004BCCA2E|5|Well packed and a perfect fit
B008ESJ68M|5|Fit perfect 👍👍👍👍
B005XEOLIK|5|Except for moisture forming inside on the drivers side high beam it was a good fit
B007WR25GG|5|This is a great roof cargo bag. Totally rain and monsoon proof! This is a very large bag with 15 cubic feet of storage. 44&#34; long x 36&#34; wide and 19&#34; tall. I purchased this bag to replace my Thule Interstate bag which was never very water resistant, and the interior rubberized liner basically disintegrated.  You could see holes through the Thule bag in many places after only 6 trips to Florida from Georgia. (7 hour drive). I purchased the Rightline bag in April and used it going to Florida this year and we hit a huge storm with hours of driving rain and wind. I figured the contents would be soaked once we arrived, but I was totally surprised...dry as a bone. Outstanding performance in unbelievable conditions. This a great bag! It comes with a small nylon storage bag. I also purchased the Rightline rubber mat, so that the bag would not rub on the top of my van. The straps are cheaply made, but with my roof rack, I was able to easily secure the bag both from side to side and front to back with the 4 straps included. I am really surprised at the great performance of this bag especially at the low cost.
B006FXG0N2|3|I was expecting this to cover the entire lense of the fog light, but it only covers the portion that is visible with the plastic fog light trim attached. This makes lining up the cover a little of a pain & also leaves a little lense exposed, since its such a perfect fit.
B007OW66BE|4|Easy to install.  Works well so far.
B000CMJS6I|5|I love it
B00FLFEO8S|5|Great
B00WID0OEE|5|It does everything I expected it to do. It removes water from my new shower door like a champ.  It helps too that it keeps it's mouth shut after witnessing the horrors that go on in my bathroom.  Brave little squeegee.  Came with extra blades, wasn't expecting that but neat!  Would definitely buy again, if I needed another.
B00407YPO6|5|Had to replace driver side mirror on my 2002 Camry and the match was great.
B009F8WL4G|5|The pistols are much larger than I expected
B00U0V0JZU|5|Matched the part number from the dealership website and searched for the product on Amazon. Product shipped quickly and arrived with all the necessary parts. The installation was quick and easy with the top bar and bottom brace and a screw to lock each corner into place. Took about 15 minutes to install on our 2013 (original post said 2015) GMC Acadia Denali.<br /><br />Updated 8/1/16: Now have a 2016 GMC Acadia Denali and these cross-rails fit that vehicle as well.
B00VNJ4TRW|3|I thought it was a real antenna to connect to the radio<br />But unfortunately it's only for decoration
B00CMOV3GW|5|Great calipers originally thought they were missing brackets but k1500 don't use brackets bolt direct to knuckle.
B00FH8P1DG|5|Works great
B0006Z9SQQ|5|First off, I had tried other products before this product and it barely even helped. Armor All worked great! My car was much dirtier than I thought once I started cleaning with these and it leaves your car looking fresh and spotless! I would definitely purchase again in the future.
B00HS5ONLM|5|Best Brakes I've ever installed.
B0083H9OYA|5|Excellent product... I´m loving it.
B00P2D4C36|5|Works good so far. No complaints.
B000KZ1Z0O|5|Good
B00I8SH7ES|5|Ordered this item for my 07 GSXR600.  I live in the Caribbean so i had to ship to my US mailbox for transshipment to my address. Got it like 2 weeks ago and installed yesterday. Installation was easy.hardest part was removing the fairings & stock exhaust which was hard because i didn't have a 12 spanner for the left side bolt. $10 bucks at a local  store and I was done in 30 mins.<br /><br />This sounds and looks great. People especially drivers know ur coming. No loss of power or speed in my opinion and i didnt even touch the set valve. Great buy for $200
B011RZ0UO2|3|Seems OK so far but the description says that the DIY programming was included and I never received any programming info. Will have to call on weekday for tech assistance...to be continued
B0000AXNJS|4|Works well.  It is best to leave on metal a few minutes...then buff out.  Worked well buffing up my Rolex
B000CF6RX2|5|AVS always makes good products, they never disappoint.
B00WRUCITC|5|Great
B000CIAVR2|5|Exact clutch and pressure plate as oem except for throw out bearing which mine was all metal this one is metal with plastic housing.
B00FLFY9F6|2|Did not fit...I give it the 2 star  rating because the part looked fine and was built well enough.<br />However,  after tearing apart my dash to find out it did not fit...well, that is why.  The shaft was not tapered enough to fit the housing. The materials seemed adequate,? I will never know...
B008B06SOI|5|They are perfect, I love them.
B00KM7EN86|5|Fast delivery, excellent packaging, product received as expected at reasonable pricing.  Very pleased!!!!
B001GQ429W|5|As expected.
B00K73QBKS|4|Decent fit.  Wify likes storing items under it.
B009AQS4IU|5|I have had this for some time and it still looks great and holds up well.
B004P3RKJC|4|Like all the other reviews, it's grayer than the rest of the trim and I had to bend it some to follow the same contour as the trim above it, but overall I'm satisfied and it blends in pretty well.
B004Q1Z8JM|2|Runs with plenty of power, shifting however is GARBAGE. You can BARELY find neutral--if your lucky--
B000EDUUI0|5|Bought these to replace a broken catch on my Jayco.  These are an exact replacement.
B0010E00T6|5|Made my car smell better when I turn on the air circulation.
B00QWT07HE|3|Bubbles-galore!!
B00F8FT6CA|5|worked ggreat thank you
B00JMUKIHO|3|Looked great at first, fits perfect on my Mazda2. After being in the sun a week, the tip and base (not the carbon fiber mid section) turned a brown-bronze like color. And the logo is quickly wearing off. Still works properly and is better than the long counterpart. Just wish the materials were a little higher in quality.
B000CON4MU|5|Have been looking for this for some time and found it on Amazon. Exactly as described and waiting to install it to get old Peterbilt cranked again.
B001S7ZT5A|4|It did exactly what it says it does
B00H3TQ136|5|Brought out the back part of car.
B00KMYYQ36|5|after using cleaner 303 on fabric convert top, applied fabric guard. Next day in thunderstorm, no sign of water penetration vs what I saw before use.
B00IABG9YC|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 camper
B0041WOEYG|5|Quick and easy transaction! Product works perfect! Easy install
B000CGCF6E|5|Wow what a difference. A bit of a trick to get on due to the springs, but used a scissor jack to get them into the correct position. Very stable but not too stiff. I get a comfortable ride from these shocks.
B007L5DNNS|5|shows well, very pleased with it. Get a lot of nice comments about it.
B00CEXKB8M|1|If i could give this negative stars i would.  THIS DOES NOT FIT THE PATHFINDER!  The rear unit does not clear the window when it closes, so it binds up.  I finally found another brand that works great, but regretfully, it was not available from Amazon.
B00KTHYAUU|5|I have a 2005 Toyota Highlander and it works great!  I was having a hard time programming it so I watched a you tube video and got it programmed after the 1st try.
B000CGG588|5|Worked great so far no issues
B000BRFUOS|5|worked great, now I can see when it is done.
B00QFEJYRU|5|Product as descibe
B000F5DQWY|5|It is loud, easy to install !
B00AKEWNRE|4|Fits fine and looks like decent quality.
B00CMX20H4|4|Thanks for the question,  yes I am happy with my purchase and it works great!
B002HGFRNU|5|use it pn my 48. volt yamaha cart, easy to use , eorks great, light, have not used my bulky , heavy yamaha charger in over 2 years,  highly recommend. this charger.
B00NHBYOA6|4|It should come with a 120V adapter. I will have to purchase one to take cooler into hotel overnight to keep things cold. Item does cool ell. Did not use warmer yet.
B000CLLLDW|5|Get replaced the striped units.
B00L7X9ZRS|5|These tailights really set the truck apart from others and look waaaaay better than stock lights. Had to use old mounting brackets to set in place. Fit like a glove!!
B005WTPC4S|1|These worked great when first installed, but are streaking badly after just a couple of months of use in the morning to wipe away the morning dew.
B00396JRCE|5|High quality hard to find triple square set, useful for working on volkswagen and other VAG (Volkswagen Audi Group) cars.
B001FKXNSK|2|Fits right into place but the joint dried up and starting speaking again after a few weeks..back to square one...Ended buying a joint with a grease fitting to replace it...
B003076AIG|5|Perfect fit once I found the right place to plug it in.
B007WR25ES|1|Very disappointed. Unable to return as 30 days passed and we ordered it well in advance of our trip. The material ripped easily and the seams started coming apart only a few hours into our drive. No clear instructions on the best way to set it up. Took us a few tries and multiple stops and adjustments to get it somewhat right. Still very loud and made the drive very uncomfortable. Not recommended.
B0041Q988E|5|Shipping was great and the Bars are Awesome
B00JBIRBK4|1|Poor quality of light, a flashlight seems underpowered, do not waste your money.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|Bought this for the wife,  works great in her Santa Fe,
B001FL5VRK|5|It's Moog and it was made in Japan! Quality guaranteed!
B00U2CDJV8|5|Worked great and is so convenient and small to have.
B00LEBLI82|5|Works well in my trailer, saves greatly on battery usage.
B00U27IZPS|3|The main problem is that the wires are too short, and the part is about half the size of the original.  Does not work without modification as a replacement for the original on my 1999 Honda Shadow VT-600C.  Bought these for the rear lights, sending back.  The parts arrived less than 2 weeks, which was a nice surprise.  No problems with seller.
B00MF5FRV0|5|Comes with loads of adapters...jumped a car and the lawn mower several times.
B00WPHZXTO|4|Everything ok
B0002F9YHS|5|Great product for keeping the leather soft in my Mercedes.
B004BYYZDY|4|Everything ok
B00ZVJ35XE|3|Really disappointed. It doesn't fit my SUV. It was a great color. The covers were put together very well. I guess I'll be gifting it to someone who can use it.
B001EP0I5M|1|This unit is not as shown in photo.  The photo shows the gooseneck, rails, pins, etc.  It does not have the rails included.  I say false advertising.
B008CE06ZA|5|This works perfectly and it does it for half the price you pay in the store.  Is super easy adjustable.
B000CQVQMS|5|Very nice and fit well.
B000HBM45Q|5|Finally, gloves with powder to help them slide on.
B00XICGK2Y|4|This is a nice unit but I think the instructions could be  clearer about setup with the Direct TV D12-100 receiver tuner. It can be a little tricky and tedious figuring out how to work your way through the program to setup the dish and switch type. I got hung up on an error message not realizing I could just continue through it. Once I figured this out (hours later) it all came together and worked nicely.<br /><br />I recommend setting this up at home with time and space to work through it. I finally set it up on a bench in the garage and ran the Satellite in the yard. It now works great and now I'm transferring all to the RV. I am looking forward to having TV when camping and traveling and plan to use for a vacation home in AZ.
B00JVHLS3G|1|After a week this Emblem turned yellow, looks horrible!!  Don't waste your money, buy the real thing!
B000W0RQ8C|1|this product is advertised to fit a Class 5 receiver and it is not long enough. It will barely fit a Class 4 receiver. The rubber cap to keep  dirt out of the key hole is also very flimsy and will not hold up.  Basically a piece of junk!!!!!
B00L4NHW7Q|5|These are not the heavy duty &#34;all weather&#34; type mats but they are well constructed, fit well, and look good. The grooves are deep enough to contain liquid spills. I would recommend these; they are good quality and a good value.
B00B8SZWAQ|5|great
B0040505GK|4|Good quality. Straps that go around rear of tire to long
B00T8M4M8C|5|Awesome look love it my car chrome rims really pop out and stands out along with the chrome window trim get em.!
B001S8Q174|5|Fits perfectly. Runs as it should. No issues. Twist on and snap, it's in.
B00HFLC3HA|1|Tensioner lasted barely a month and lost the internal spring.
B00YI78WW4|4|Very nice very happy with it. Very affordable price. Installation was little tricky. Front seat was very easy to install.  The rear seat you have to take out the bottom seat out to install the seat cover. The back seat also have to fold forward in able to install seat cover. The one thing I don't understand. When you install the rear seat the their are no holes to insert the head rest . I guess you cut out holes your self. Other wise it's good seat covers.
B00JVUDAZC|2|To small
B000GVM7CM|5|I have a 2003 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner Double Cab.  Bought the pop & lock to go along with a bed extender that I also purchased on Amazon.  The reason I bought this item is so I wouldn't have to always remove the bed extender when my truck is parked, but rather keep it in the inside position and the tailgate locked.  It is a great theft deterrent that prevents thieves from walking away with my bed extender.  It looks really good and matches perfectly with the original tailgate handle.  The instructions were very easy to follow as it took me only about 5 minutes to install.  Great product!
B00QMKYYYK|5|Good price
B009LUQFMC|5|Very nice upgrade for the money.
B00IP6A09W|5|These damn things. I tell you, are the most GORGEOUS lights I've ever seen on a 88-98 style truck. These just make my black 95 Tahoe look 1000 times better imo. Look like $150+ headlights honestly. Only complaint is that there is bubbling in the lens part a little bit. Not really noticeable unless you look pretty close though. Great buy.
B010M1I6EI|5|Quality part
B00WSALFCM|5|Product arrived on time and as described. I'm giving it to my niece for her birthday.
B00FEQRS00|5|Easy to install and saved me lots of money vs. having a dealer install it. I was quotes $236 for this and purchased it, put it in, and saved $136.
B00MMJLCKY|5|Its perfect for my needs
B00FMOJZHS|5|Easy to install.
B00GNJX78Y|4|I searched for a while to find a product that would incorporate bluetooth technology into my factory Volvo sound system. This solution was by far the best. I couldn't be happier.
B00RMNNAKA|5|Well made and bright!  I got these at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  I gave it to my son for his truck.  He is thrilled.  Good quality easy installation and perfect spot light!  It's ruggedness fits right in with his truck and his night time &#34;mudding&#34;.
B000WEOQD6|5|Nice
B00LBJQJV8|1|The part I received works intermittent. it appears to have a short in it. When I tap on it, it works but cuts out after a short time. I received a bad product!
B002S0IRQY|5|First class
B00BMRRXXW|5|Been using these for years and they are very helpful and time saving when switching to different devices that hook up to a garden hose. Camco brand is the way to go. I tried ordering one that didn't say Camco and it was a cheap knock off that I ended up sending back. I only wish they had a bigger kit like they used to sell at Sams a few years back.
B006T08WXM|5|It fit my 2015 challenger scat pack and hasnt fallen off yet.  What more can you ask for?
B00IQWHOJO|5|☺
B00IWO4K8O|1|The connection wasn't match up for my car seat. Did nothing for me.
B00LV18KWM|5|This is a very interesting design that has taken out the slop in my hitch assembly.
B001CF1A7O|4|Seem's well built
B004UR15OY|3|seems to work ok
B0128SDK9E|5|Thanks for the product
B0052XFWCG|3|Probably works great. Don't know if stiction was my problem so I didn't notice a difference.
B000C1LLJ6|5|Pads are great
B006Z3BJLA|4|Couldn't find this item in stores anymore - but this is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />One of the two packages I received was cut open - so as an air freshener - much of the fragrance had vanished. Cut open like with a box cutter or knife. All three sealed air fresheners were open.
B00ASMXEZI|1|Battery arrived in a plastic bag dripping wet. Manufacturer said all is ok. Battery died after 6 months in my wife's dirt bike. Very disappointed.
B00EFFXJE0|4|a couple of cans didn't spray that well
B00JH2CE10|5|Had installed by local Tire Kingdom and saved 50% compared to Nissan Dealership
B001PWFPE8|5|nice improvement to tail gate
B00COYZ9NS|1|Poor quality and workmanship. Product exhibited forming wrinkles, tool marks and handling damage near the bend sections of the bars - the chrome plate was applied over the damaged sections. Also, the picture shown for the Ford truck reflects 3 brackets to attach the bars - the product I received only had two attach points.
B007OWYIWS|5|this skirt was perfect, thank you, if I ever need another one I will definitely order it from you,
B0040CTVZE|5|Only needed for the passenger side for c5 corvette  also have to cut and splice
B00A6CHOG0|1|Didn't fit.
B0087XOTWW|5|Good buy for the price, very brite and good fit, I used it for the corner light of my 2013 accord
B00OKYV7PE|5|Easy to install and improved my power and fuel economey.
B00VM84DTS|5|Good quality leather, looks like it will last a long time with proper care.
B000KPQ7FW|5|it is a god product
B00M135SRO|5|Oh yes, love this
B00A93SXI4|5|Just what I was looking for looks real good on my 2007 acura RL
B009XCYSIQ|5|I am not a pro but the results from this product make my friends wonder. They encourage me to change my profession. Extremely pleased with how the product works.
B002R0KX44|5|Awesome!  FIT perfectly!
B000C9O640|5|Very difficult item to find. Amazon not only had it, they had the best price and the fastest shipping.very high quality item and best of all, it works. This is the coil spring perch bushion  Used on amc gremlin vehicles
B000PF13JW|1|Best stuff there is for sealing a gasketed windshield or back lite.  Unfortunately, whomever fulfilled this order for Amazon must have been jumping for joy to get rid of old inventory.  These tubes were so full of hardened product that every single one of the four burst at the base and filled my caulking gun with about 1/4 of the tube each time.  I'll know to simply buy locally the next time.
B00K8ATENQ|5|work for now how long will it last
B00RW8560M|5|Exactly what I needed. Perfectly sized with both UV and water repellent. Inside is a soft cotton liner to protect my investment.
B000CMJW46|5|Works fine. Use it to run air compressor directly from the battery on RZR.
B008SFF67Q|4|Tried it on bike, fits well. Haven't actually used it yet. Expect no problems.
B007V2DQYW|5|It did reduce heat like they said it would and im very happy i got it.
B006573KF4|5|Fit perfect
B00MV9UJNG|5|Fast shipping, just what my gs400 need, thanks
B00JXZKY7M|5|Works and fit perfectly
B009HX77WU|4|At 1/3 the price of OEM parts, these hinges worked out great on my 12 year old jeep.
B00KTI7DZS|2|arrived quickly, but did not work with my 2000 GMC Sierra 1500
B007D94HEQ|5|Works awesome with my Aprilia RSVR
B00U1Y3JGM|3|Ok for the price. Wish the bottom was wider
B000CHMLK8|5|Item was as expected. Delivery via USPS was mishandled by seller in my opinion.
B0039ZS01Y|5|Fast shipping and fit good
B00SBYQ0HE|5|Arrived quickly and as advertised
B00FRI1HG6|3|I would really like to give this 2 stars due to the product being shipped several days after the time it said that it would be at my door step. Second this came with an orifice tube that was wedged in so tight I had to struggle an hour to pick it out. Finally this came with tabs on the corners that made the padded brackets that are stock not fit like OEM standard parts. Both of these things combined with that late shipping that pushed my install date back a week made this item 3 stars at best.
B00G09LTAK|5|Worked great! 2003 GMC Yukon ball joints, 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee front end pieces.
B0041TLKSM|5|Exactly as described
B00ZX1ZTJ8|5|Very nice
B00MWH72IW|1|Doesn't work DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! I repeat DO NOT BUY!!!!! Just bought this product and it was a complete waste of money water goes right through it. Don't waste your money like I did!!!
B00V9SIENC|4|I like the lights. They are better than I thought they would be.
B008P53EZ0|5|Super!!! Work's as it has to do!
B00F8NVX3M|4|There were two things I found a bit frustrating (but no deal breaker for a future purchase) - 1) The cord in between the two heads is WAAAYYY too long, and, 2) It did not come with any type of instructions (use or installation).  Other than those two things, this light bar is great value for the money. I like the various flash patterns and it is super bright!
B00EHIO9IU|5|Very impressive light and great customer service.
B000BRF1U6|1|I bought this hose/regulator assembly about two years ago to replace the regulator on a Weber barbecue (no gas flow). Last week the Camco regulator failed, allowing high pressure gas to flow to the barbecue. The barbecue control valve couldn't hold the pressure, and a large flare up occurred. Luckily I was able to reach over to the LP tank and shut off the gas with the valve on the tank. This regulator was always kept under cover when not in use.<br /><br />I would not recommend this regulator as I feel it is unsafe. I will be replacing it with a Marshall regulator, as I don't want to try my luck with another cheap imported device which can be a safety hazard.
B00JA396BW|5|I purchases the 24&#34; and 19&#34; PIAA Aero Vogue Silicon wipers for my mom's 2005 Camry. It has been using Bosch Icon wipers for the past 3 years and have worked well, but a recent storm cracked the windshield and had to be replaced. When that was done, I installed the new PIAA wipers. They do an amazing job since they are made from silicon. It cleans the water off, does not streak or chatter, and there is no noise. It was a toss up between the Aero Vogue and the Si-Tech, but the Aero Vogue is still made in Japan while the Si-Tech is now being made in Vietnam (lower quality).<br /><br />On a side note, I did try PIAA wipers on my 2009 Altima. The Aero Vogue 26 or 28&#34; on the drivers side and 17&#34; on the passenger side, but due to the curvature of the glass, several inches of the blade do not even touch the glass. I then tried the Si-Tech 26&#34; and 17&#34; on the Altima, and they do it and make full contact with the glass. But when used at high wiper speed, part of the wiper place arm is turning under and makes a loud squeaking noise. So I ended up buying a new pair of Bosch Icons for the Altima.
B0049LSD0U|4|Kind of feels cheap. Stick with glass jars...
B000GTYI8A|2|I have a 1982 CB900F Super Sport that I bought new in 82. This blinker does not fit. The screw hole which mounts blinker to the bracket on the bike does not line up. I would have returned it but I damaged the wires taking it off and on trying to make it work. Looks nice, built nice but it no fit my bike. I can use the bulb and lens someday,  maybe.
B000P155CM|5|Great.
B00432S99U|5|Great product and really works well for several hours.  Would recommend to others.
B006H4ONNS|5|Great just wish this item had a tracker on it.
B00LUT71HU|5|Super cute!!!!!  They are nice and sparkly!
B004OHJ33K|5|Got these for our 2013 Ford Explore (Limited), nice liners that fit perfectly (need to take out the factory mats) and look good. Better price than another national brand I checked on, and only very slightly lighter duty,should last the life of the vehicle. Very happy with these fitted mats.
B000EDUUIA|5|Still adhered well to the garage floor after a couple months.
B008GVBM70|1|Not all lites work
B000O1C47M|5|Good vacuum for a good price, I've gotten a fair amount of use out of it and seen no problems yet. Also comes with enough oil to fill it up initially once.
B004C6OBBC|5|Seems to be a quality item.  Not too long and the plating should keep it from rusting.
B000FJ1MAI|5|I have a 2000 Honda Accord ES with a ULEV-Vtech 4.0 engine.<br /><br />I went to AutoZone and was diagnosed for an Air Fuel Ratio Sensor Upstream (Front  O2 Sensor) I was recommend a Universal Bosch sensor that cost about $80 at AutoZone. Once I replaced the old with the new with the Bosch, the symptoms such as rough idle, hesitant acceleration, etc, where gone, but the check engine light remained even after resetting it. I also found myself  putting gas in the car 3X as much!!<br /><br />I was wasting my money on gas. So, I decided to make the investment of a Denso 234-9025 O2 sensor (Denso is the original manufacturer for Honda parts.) Yes, pricey for a sensor, but I would of probably spent that and more on gas and aspirin (for the headaches it would cause me!).<br /><br />Make sure you do your research to find the exact fit!!!! I cannot stress this more. I should also mention that the part I received from AutoZone was too short. The Bosch sensor connected but was not a comfortable fit. This Denso sensor fixed this problem for it was the EXACT fit.<br /><br />In conclusion: One size does not fit all! Honda accords like mine  are very particular about which O2 sensors you put on it. Do your research to find YOUR exact fit, and make sure the wire is long enough!!<br /><br />(YouTube videos on how to do it are available.  Saves you money, and it's very easy if you're doing the front sensor. AutoZone rents the tools for about  $20 dollars, and they refund the money once their tools are returned.)
B0016KG72I|5|I installed this on my 2008 Buick Enclave in less than 20 minutes.<br />I didn't mess with removing exhaust hangers or the spare, just the bumper cover.<br />The bumper cover does not fit back on after installation, but that is not important to me. I wouldn't want to have to take it of every time I use it anyway.<br /><br />Pulling down on the tail pipes a little gave me enough clearance to get the bolts in and tighten them and all my bolt holes were factory threaded so I didn't need to use the stick bolts.<br /><br />Currently I am just using this for a hitch mount bike rack. I plan on installing a wiring kit and tranny cooler for trailer use in the future.
B00PA2LMVY|5|Great car wash. I always ordered this directly from Griot's and had to pay shipping, wish I knew I could get this here on Amazon sooner, could have saved some money on shipping.  With my Amazon Prime it got here in 2 days (on a Sunday)  and no additional shipping fee. Like all of Griot's products this is exceptional.
B00DZ352NY|2|It was fast delivery, but wrong size, too big to fit.
B000EVYGZA|4|Great tool.  Seems a little counter intuitive to use...but fine if you revisit the instructions.  No issue beyond novice's understanding of functions.
B000F3RYGA|5|Works well and seems to be built tough. Easy on and off.
B0009IQYBC|5|The perfect product for the right job!!!
B00RIVNP1K|5|The security trunk cargo is great. It was just what I needed to keep my stuff from sliding around in my cargo
B00150T13G|5|Great
B00YG3K192|4|Works as intended and looks great.
B002XWB5MU|3|So so
B001CF6LQO|5|Nice heavy duty tire cover.  Perfect in every way
B008C0X4NA|3|The fit is great better than any I've had. However, the silver covering started to bubble up in like a 2 inch in diameter bubble in 4 days of Arizona sun. Maybe this is a California sun shade not an Arizona sunshade. just saying
B000FQBWCY|5|Wonderful.  If you can live without the Porsche logo, this is a no-brainer.
B007EZOIMU|1|This is the worst product I Hae ever purchased. Carring two surfboards on my way to the shore the metal secure attaching parts gave in in the middle of the highway. Thank God no one got injured and my boards thanks to the awesome cases are fine. But when it comes to this rack I wont recommend to anyone to buy it invest your money on a better rack from a reliable brand like Thule.. Be safe!! Don't even try this product.
B00267PZUK|5|Tool works like a charm... I'm a pro technician and if your working on Ford trucks you need this tool
B000CQBND0|5|ita what I need.  Purchase was flawless
B00UIO2NW6|4|fit perfectly. thanks.
B00KPR12ZU|5|This is the original equipment metal rod.  Simple.  And then I found the old one that I had lost.  lol  Never hurts to have two.
B00E7FU4SC|3|Don't know if it's the relay or my scooter but it doesn't make a sound at all when turned on. My scooter is less than 2 years old but started to have electrical issues. The old relay started buzzing and when it was plugged in my scooter wouldnt start. So had to go a week without turn signals. Once I got this I had signals again and scooter started just fine but all my lights get dim then bright with the flashers and my rpm guage goes up and down. Other than that it works well enough.
B000EEU0IO|4|The seat would not stay in one place. I had to adjust it at every entrance. There were times when I could feel air circulating under and  my bottom and behind my back which makes the seat worth every penny of its cost.
B000LEPT5G|4|For the price it spits out generic codes even in my 98 BMW and the attached guide gives a short detail on what each code means. Combining this with a google search of the code that the unit produces can make for an effective start to diagnosing that check engine light in your car. This unit clears codes and reads codes with no problems so long as your vehicle year is within the range!
B003GYV8A8|3|My only upset with this prdouct is that when I open the box and pull the container out there is an indication that shows when the cool shoe rinks when to replace in my school is already at bat indication showing that I have to buy a new one already. I think there was supposed to be more go in the container than what mine came with. I hope I didn't get a used one
B00NEL6HT0|5|Seems to have a bit better airflow using AC during the hot and muggy days of summer.<br />Others have been saying there is a odor, but it is a pleasant odor, not offensive at all.<br />As with every other K&N product that I have used over the years, they produce a reliable product.
B00LM555CU|5|Love the smell - use them in the garage!
B00J9C5AFU|5|ADORABLE
B00DC5TV0A|5|these are great!  Very well built and do just as they say they can do. Awesome
B004XDVFCW|4|This works really well
B00UME69SG|5|Great job
B00T3E8XBC|5|Very nice vinyl decal that came off the paper incredibly easy. Brilliant blue color! Nice detail. A must have for the Whovian.
B00C5SGEQO|4|These are a pain in the butt to install. They work fine afterward.
B00J2PL5K8|1|The lightbulb  that came with the black side lights do not work!
B003YYMM1E|5|It's a decal. What's to say? It's not like it was broken out of the box or the plot was thin. I like it because it's what I'm in to and I've seen it on other cars. If you don't like this, don't get it for your car. Or dog.
B00KSY3HFS|5|Very light weight. Came right on time. Bought for my mom, but think I will get one for me.
B00KOQDZ7U|5|love them... Make the wheels look amazing ... Easy to install... Had them on in an hour
B001BB4LBG|5|Good cover fit my 15 inch trailer tire perfectly. Kind of wrinkled vinyl, but ok after a day in th sun. Last one I had this brand lasted 6 years and as still in good shape, I only replaced it because it was dirty.
B00MMQRIHI|5|Fits my 2015 Forester perfectly and looks great...$20 cheaper than a factory exhaust tip...
B0002VFE30|5|Had a bad jack on my camper, took about 10 minutes to replace it. Only needed one, but for this price I have another spare, plus I have the push rod! never even knew that existed or what those holes were for!
B004C6BAPC|5|Every thing is good arrived on time
B002C7DSIK|4|I bought this net to keep my dogs in the back on our trip and also for a grocery holder.  I have 2 huskies and it kept them from getting out but it's easily pushed to the side so they kept sticking their heads through.  My issue was the actual net portion doesn't stretch.  Just the outer edges.  So it does stretch to the size stated but leaves huge gaps.  I was hoping to stretch it to completely to close the back but it did its job... Barely.  Can't go wrong for the price.
B007PMY3MM|1|Looked great at first. Didn't last very long as the thread started coming apart on one of the W's, so I took them out of the car.
B00407YQ4U|1|Purchased this exact black paint (BTY 1566), which they claim is a match. It is not even close.
B0040Z7XCE|3|Good product, especially for the price. However, they came with a crease on both pieces in the front; I needed to apply some silicone sealer to get them to adhere perfectly in front, but that worked well. This crease probably occurred in shipping, but it was for a farm truck and I wasn't worried about it.
B0006JLW5M|5|As described
B00BD9HYGU|5|Love this helmet. My brother got a modular more than 5 years ago. I sure wish i would have bought one at the same time. You have many choices of visor openings, settings, etc. The flip down sun shield is much more convenient than sun glasses. Great price too.
B00RC9NH34|5|Great car cover fits Chevy Cruze well.
B00BEZBZ04|5|Comes with an oil pan and got to my house in days would definitely have my friends get this when they ask what to get for a stand
B002E2WMWG|5|I have had these in about a month in my 2012 Focus, and I just love the look. Everyone in my car club has these and we love them.  EDIT: It's now been a year and a halfish since I bought these, and they're still on the car, going strong. I drive with them on all of the time in my fog lights. I drive a lot, I think I've put ~35,000 miles on the car and they haven't burnt out yet. I'm actually quite curious at this point how long they will continue to last. But for the price I paid and the length of usage I've gotten out of them I am more than statisfied.
B00CXMPR2E|5|Applies easily and stays on like a champion. The perfect addition to any car.
B00SC1054K|3|Not as nice as the factory ones.  Have to press the buttons a few times before they actually work.
B004940ZNK|5|Worked perfectly. Dealer told me it would be 200 to replace. I did it myself with this and about 15 minutes in my Chevorlet Malibu 2007
B00BFU415O|5|fit perfectly, just what was needed.
B000NSHW32|5|Perfect replacement
B004SS0H6W|5|Husband loved them
B000SOM9GQ|1|Doesn't work with Toyota Camry 1999.
B00K6D38LO|5|High quality and service
B00ANHSEDK|5|Great item, easy install and much much cheaper than paying to have the work done.
B00NFA22XU|1|I installed these lights and was amazed at the difference between them and regular bulbs. The feeling of bliss and happiness was short lived as i have only had these lights installed for about a week and one of the ballast went out today.
B00KPZECVI|5|took this to the autolocksmith today and had them cut and programmed it for me. It works perfectly fine with no problem. It cost me $75 to have it cut and programmed.
B009681GM8|5|When I threw this on my 2001 mustang , I felt the instant 50% hp gain . It was insane!
B00006JBL4|5|Worked very well at holding my bike on the wall and had a small shelf to put an item there.
B0000AY87G|4|I was expecting one black one as shown in one of the photos. Wanted black to match my bumper. Ended up with 3 gray. Whatever works for me. Thought I was paying for 1 got 3.
B000BQW5LK|5|Worked great for changing my fluid In my transmission. Didn't screw onto the bottle but the auction hose was plenty long enough to get all the fluid out.
B000GAP428|5|Best price and quality
B0000AXPDU|1|Amazon shouldn't post or recommend items that do not fit or are not compatible with other items... # WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!
B0023VP02M|5|good quality
B0031KOM28|5|Love it
B00LPOKAZK|1|complete rip off. this is 45$ in other sites, and quality is for 45$. only lasted 6 month. very bad material quality!!
B0007WTE08|4|worked
B0091OE6K6|5|Hate that strap on my neck.  Have used these for years and work great.  Put in new car and use in back seats.  Good for children.
B00M5CYW6O|5|Excellent
B00MU5X17M|5|Wow!  10 minutes to replace... if you make sure the inside of the vehicle is real warm.... 90 degrees plus, the tabs on the underside cover (4 screws) will less likely break when you pull it off.  Works great and a better grade of plastic that I am sure will last the rest of the  life of the truck.
B00SIBO6MQ|5|For the price I can't complain. The shield and frame have good build quality and look great on my truck.
B00MR2QRGK|5|excellent
B00ESM93HW|5|Awesome! Was looking for a shark themed chrome emblem for my Dodge Ram Pick-up....this was it!
B00GPUIZ4C|5|good deal
B00OQVH2QO|5|Fantastic helmet. Fits great quiet and looks good. Haven't tested its safety strength, and hope to never have to
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product. I bought three.
B000E4JLM0|5|good part
B00KRQOLB6|5|It's a sticker.
B0023VQNTQ|5|I put an after shifter in my 09 corvette, and the stock shifter didn't fit. I tried 3 or 4 before I got this one, looks great, and fits good.
B003J97TGM|1|Bought them and they fit baddly. Returned and never got refunded! Tired of dealing with them and gave up. Don't buy!
B00068OL1A|4|Used this to coat stainless steel kitchen appliances that show fingerprints too easily.  It works pretty well and is fairly easy to apply and maintain.
B0109J0GXM|4|I bought a full set of these wheel spacers so my 17&#34; Rotas would clear the brake calipers. They're of good material and fitment over the hub was perfect. Although I only rate these as a 4 star product because the stock lug studs and even the included lug nuts protruded past the deck height of their recessions. I had to grind all 20 down until they were flush with an angle grinder. Can't hate that price though.
B00FW1VFAG|1|I bought it for my Crosstrex Subaru.  It worked for the first load going camping but it was a light load.  It has a lot of wobble in it and need to make sure the load is near the center.  In the folded up position, it rubbed the paint off my bumper.  That bumper repair will be about 150 paint job fix.  It was not in a few spots but In a bunch and dug into the plastic too.  If you have a car you can not fold it up with out serious damage to the vehicle's bumper.  I would not buy this again and would return it If I did not already put it together and used it.
B0001EFSTI|4|Excellent item
B00E63FE5I|5|everybody knows Haynes... very good reference.
B00ME7GYB6|5|Perfect.  Made taking my Ford's factory stereo out a snap.  Well worth the small cost to make a job quick and easy.
B00MJ47UP8|1|I bought this product less than one year ago. Already pealing and rusty.  Wrote about warranty which is for 3 years. Thay want $130.00 plus my shipping it to them to process.  I paid that much for them in the first place!  Guess I'll be eating this one and buying better set from someone else!
B00HVHFBZY|5|Fit perfect on my 2005 Jeep Liberty !
B001ADBV18|5|This thing went in super easy and stopped my stuff from sliding around. Wish Toyota had installed is as standard equipment.
B0119ZGPXK|5|Awesome!
B00JSTY0AA|5|Beautiful and well crafted!
B00NEL7BWM|5|Fine
B00JKOSUMM|4|When ordering it never occurred to me to distinguish between power and Manuel seats. I couldn't find the distinction in the product description. It's a quality product, but be aware this item fits power seats only. Unfortunately, my Golf has manual seats. Hopefully, Amazon will accept my return.
B00KCQSIRY|1|It does not fit
B009PAK75E|5|Good quality, decent fit.
B00CB8WM2S|5|Great product sold by a great Amazon partner.
B00HX363ZS|5|hat is great and got it fast
B000O0V1P4|4|Good fit , easy install,  great price!
B00400R22A|4|I only needed a screw out of the kit.  I could not find just a screw.  So it met my needs and gave me extra parts.
B006CPZTU8|5|Works great would buy again
B00029WYEY|5|Excellent
B00P2U11W4|4|They are fine but are missing the Velcro straps to close when not using
B00TEA5PZC|5|high quality frame...my car looks great with this...will order another.
B00HS5JLYQ|5|Great quality.  The slots do cause a vibration under hard braking.  I think it's normal.
B00L9QXKRE|5|awesome product!
B00FALW192|5|Great product. Use sparely.
B00L35NUK8|1|Did not fit my model car like they said it would.
B00WH2NODO|5|Very satisfied with near perfect fit and no installation problems.Would recommend to friends and family.
B006E908IA|5|Looks good on the Accord.
B003TUCETI|5|Excellent
B001TNDS10|1|Don't waste your money, buy an air bag system you will be happier. Don't be fooled by their statements about how good they are you have to have amminimum of two inches of clearance or your ride will be to stiff but then you are sagging to much, as for offloading their is a sydtem made by daystar that will work with air bags and customer service will be better than timbrens. Tried to send mine back because of these issues but no dice .
B00P1JFWVM|3|It is not working properly,  it will be off after I drive a mile or so. When I am waiting for the traffic light,  I can see the running light is off  from the reflection on the bumper of the car in front me. I have to switch gear in order to make the light again.  I have to buy another one from eBay,  looks cheap but works fine.
B003UXZ6RG|5|This product enhanced the look of the car.
B00192JFYA|5|Great quality of polycarbonate glass. Love them!
B00I2ENZ3A|5|Does more more to get tailgaters off your rear bumper than all the brake checks and single finger gestures combined...
B000BWAPPW|5|I used part of it to make a new gasket for the oil filler cap on my 89YJ. Works good.
B008M7SVBS|1|All the logos fell off the valve caps
B002C7DSIK|5|I put this net in the back of my Toyota Tacoma to hold My cooler from sliding around in the back,it works awesome, I can go on dirt roads,turn corners, my cooler stays put! This is very easy to install,you just need a drill and a screwdriver,takes 10 min.
B00G6IHXQ4|5|All the internet research I did to find an excellent vinyl paint lead me to this.  Easy to apply ( clean the surfaces properly beforehand! ) , three light coats, and perfect!  It's also remarkably durable on flexible parts. Just...wow.
B00CO044QU|5|Was great got them right away they will fit perfect
B000IYIWDU|5|Great product!
B000VU4WYE|5|The grill was a fantastic gift buy for my husband.  The workmanship is great and the look really compliments the beauty of his custom truck.  No problems with shipment or product contents/instructions.  Fast and efficient service!
B006OQ3NMQ|5|works great
B005WXDPRA|5|Fit perfect, impervious to the weather. I just uncovered my truck this morning after 4 weeks and it's spotless ! So much better in every way  than I've used in the past (Empire). Great product and great value.Thanks
B001XV8P0C|5|Exactly what I needed delivered quickly.
B001F7EK3U|5|Install was very easy when used with the Powerbuilt 648691 Oxygen Sensor Offset Puller. Plug and play, a clip halfway down the wire matched perfectly with the stock sensor I removed.
B0088LL7UA|5|Perfect!  This mount is exactly what I hoped for.  It holds my Nexus 5 firmly, but it's easy to mount and dismount the phone with one hand.  It holds firm and I don't have any vibration or looseness.  The spring isn't too firm, but it holds the phone very securely.<br /><br />The outer positions for the second set of side supports overlaps the PWR and volume buttons, but the inner set misses them just perfectly.<br /><br />It's a pretty well thought out design.  The included bolts have the rights sizes, the nuts are all nylon locking nuts, and you don't even need to hold the nuts because the plastic has features that prevent the nuts from rotating when you assembled it.  Very convenient and easy to assemble.<br /><br />I can't think of anything more I'd ask for.  The only thing off about it is that depending on the length of your phone, the phone is off-center to the ball mount on the back since only one side of the mount adjusts.  Very minor issue, hardly noticeable.  Kind of inherent to the simplicity of the design.<br /><br />Pics shown with nexus 5 mounted.
B004470FZK|5|Fits perfectly on my KIA Sedona 2014.
B00WFILT4Q|1|Didn't work at all,  very displeased
B000M5YYIW|5|What there to say. Everything you need is there and good quality.
B00F7HD6VQ|5|Love it.  We have a lot of friends and family that run and it makes a great conversation piece.
B000CGKIDQ|4|Fit perfect
B00ASMX23W|4|The battery works and fits fine.  I would give it a 5 except I have only had it a couple of weeks.
B00D11F41U|5|They fit perfectly
B004CJ4IQC|5|Extremely easy to install on my 2015 F250. Works as advertised.
B00SUTHIVM|1|I didn't know if this organizer would work.  I had 3 - 4 medium tool cases and 5 - 6 other smaller cases.  Bought this organizer  and &#34;WOW&#34;  has it lived up to all the positive reviews.  It is sturdy and it has a lot of room for what I need.  So instead of things sliding all over the place, they are now  all together.  If you hadn't guessed,  highly recommended.  *** Well after a 1 1/2 years, the seams are coming apart.  As much as I liked it before, sorry I have to down grade my rating. What could have been a great product is no longer recommended *****
B000C42QV0|5|Good product. The two struts arrived on time as promised. They looked slightly different. One is made in Japan and one is made in USA. I had them installed on my car this weekend and the ride performance if much better. My car now feels almost as when it was new. I also bought two for the rear model KYB 334228.
B0058RN2AA|5|nice addition to my system
B00887LE1G|4|Great bang for buck
B000WJBMQK|5|awesome tool
B002UC18HU|1|This not a direct replacement for a G6A-7 Atwood water heater. The extra elbows are not enough to do the job. I had to relocate the gas line, re-tap the 3/4&#34; NPT threads because it wouldn't thread in...and burner is cocked and doesn't fit right now. Yes you can get it to work but this is not an easy repair and it still will not be 100% right when you're done. Look on EBAY for an original 91601.
B00B5AA16W|4|I  wear a 2XL (12) in Held and Vanson.  Was told that these run small.  Ordered 3XL.  Seem a bit tight, but...hoping they will break in a bit and be more comfortable down the road.  Everything else seems to be fine.
B00008RW9U|5|works great
B002QGVW3K|2|Didn't hold up as well as the original in an emergency rechargeable flashlight that was rarely used and always plugged in. Lasted a little more than a year when the original lasted more than 5 years in similar conditions.
B00KA49H2I|1|Although it was very pretty, it didn't fit my 2015 Kia Soul key. I was highly disappointed because it said it was compatible.
B00AZMD870|3|It was perfect at first but after a month or so the wires turned to dust it stopped working, poor quality on the wires.
B004TM81KG|5|The Cap worked perfectly.  That is all that is needed to know.
B00JB69438|5|Worked great
B00ZEJGDT4|5|Delivered early. High quality. Looks way cool and the magnet makes it handy. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for.
B00EJFH6YA|1|Bought this product in late June and it already has a set of four cubes burnt out and not working. Just barely too late to return this piece of garbage.
B000HLO7QA|5|Does the job. Replaced a different brand that broke.
B008GNG5LG|2|It's not the exact size.
B00QRWR1YI|5|Very adequate, good product
B00GUF74HQ|5|This cylinder functions exactly as advertised. The tailgate lowers slow enough to not bounce or slam down which is exactly what I expected and needed. Installation took about ten minutes and was very easy with a minimum of effort and a small amount of knowledge of concerning automotive bolts and pins.
B000HCUTMA|4|please
B006QAY32O|4|Fits pretty close to perfect.Easy to install. It took me just 45 minutes from start to finish. There are just six bolts to the installation, five of the six bolt holes lined up with my vehicle frame. Hey, five bolts is good enough.
B008G28KGK|4|please
B00CFCHSZG|5|Perfect fit. Product  exactly  as described
B0002UNON8|5|Works! Bonerific
B000JZZDA8|5|Great replacement for my 2004 Elantra, popped it in easy and reset the ODB error and it never came back on.
B006AX3UXA|1|I didn't even get the right license plate frame. It was completely different. How does that happen?!
B00KPR2R7C|5|Just installed on a 2010 Honda CRV. Took me a full day plus taking my time. I like that there is no box to remove and that it uses power brakes to stop and not a dead pedal. The install was actually easy but took some time because its not something you install frequently. A little bit of fine tuning needed to get it working the way you want. Had to email questions a couple of times and they were responsive. Watch the 38 minute You Tube video installation before starting. They include this with a CD.
B00DPIEDLG|5|Great OEM Toyota product.  Set of four (4) dark charcoal-colored, carpeted floor mats (the front 2 say &#34;Tacoma&#34;) that fit my 2015 Tacoma 4x4 TRD Off-Road Access Cab perfectly.  They secure to the floor board with a twist-knob set-up and protect my truck's factory carpeting from dirty feet.  Plus, they look good!
B00UG9FIPM|5|Ordered one day,  standard shipping, recieved it the next day! Exellent quality. Much better than what was available locally, and at a better price!
B003BGYWUE|4|Good
B00496KCCC|5|An awesome air filter. Made of quality materials and does an awesome job.
B00BZEGO32|1|had to get a new credit card ,after using my for this Baltimore Orioles 2-pack velour auto on amazon.
B009DK4TWI|3|It worksbut it does not quite fit my vehicle. I have it mounted but it will not stand straight up. I looks funny leaning towards the side. I tried turning the mount various ways but could not make it stand up straight.
B00EWHNZUE|5|everything works wonders better than expected.
B002IZDM50|5|worked great to fix my camper shower
B00HJ6O95A|5|Exellent
B00REJXVEW|5|Easy to install, fit perfectly.
B00K326GT4|1|It did not come with any instructions, watch a few youtube videos and figured out how it works and what to do. The whole tool is cheaply made. The pin that rivets the mast link on kept bending and I had to keep straightening it with pliers. The back plates kept getting holes put into them and the chain pins kept going into them and started being pushed out. Tried to use one of the anvils and it would not fit where the back plate goes so I forced it and that worked much better. Threw it in the trash when i was done, it was all bent and in pieces, and no I wasn't beating on it the thiing just fell apart.
B00TMAKVH6|2|Didn't keep its color at all very disapointed
B001LNKH6W|5|Great fenders fit my 185's perfect
B001I1GFRC|5|Nice sticker, simple and to the point.
B001KOIR8W|1|glue residue even after 6 months. It ooze out from the corners of the grip pad
B00Z8TGR4G|4|Does it come in clearxor white led?
B00BV0C8TE|5|Wow. This stuff cleans really well, leaves my hands moisturized, and smells pretty nifty too. Much better than the citrus stuff you find in auto parts stores.
B00DBLIQUQ|5|Nice quality part. Doesn't have that cheap feeling to it.
B003XVNEXS|5|Working well, satisfied to this point wonderful ride.
B001UDZJPM|5|It was like what I expected and now it works great
B00CGVFFJ2|1|junk did not fit seller charge aloot to return buyer beware
B001SIFHUQ|1|This is not a genuine Sparco product. Sparco is an Italian brand that manufacturers everything in Italy, and there is a 'Made in China' tag on it. In addition to the tag being incorrect, the material is not correct (supposed to be neoprene), and the stitching and craftsmanship is quite poor (foam padding poking out from around the stitching, etc). I am returning this product and having it returned.
B006R7AW6M|5|Worked as expected
B000EVWDAK|4|[[VIDEOID:af1eb8a57dc3016570c113bb0bf44194]] Quick overview of the Innova 3100 Diagnostic Scan Tool for ODB2 and ABS.  Overall very nice device and easy to use.  Some of the other functions were not as easy to figure out.  Having a pay solution on the Innova website to further help with code fixes and more is a nice option to have.
B00QL4L1B6|5|Although the listing doesn't state it, these are &#34;In-Channel&#34; deflectors and they fit the 2015 Juke perfectly!!
B00EZOUPCA|5|I replaced all 18 of our travel trailer's interior 921 incandescent bulbs with these and I see very little difference in light output.  Everyone I installed worked just fine and the light output seems comparable to the bulbs I took out at much less power draw from our battery bank and much less heat output.  I am very satisfied with these LEDs so far and will update this review after our upcoming month-long trip with some real-world experience with them. 10/7/2015:  We used these daily (and nightly) for 30 straight days while on a 6,000+ mile RV trip and they performed flawlessly.  No problems--all of them are still working just fine.  I recommend them.
B006IHUT6O|5|High quality, stainless steel travel mug.
B0002U2V1Y|5|You would be foolish to not buy this. Restores your vehicles paint condition to how it looked when you bought it. I have an 04 Ford Explorer that looks amazing  (minus the various scratches). Large area vehicles like mine took care of that entire bottle of lubricant though, and I wanted to spot check when I was done, that would be my only complaint but I figured it would happen. Also depends on how dirty your vehicle is, I found I could have used only one bar to clean my entire vehicle, but I used both just to make sure. Leaves your vehicle feeling very smooth after you've finished. Great product.
B005CLMRE4|4|Part fit great and great price
B00NQVFM9O|5|very handy item
B002092DWC|5|works good
B00042KJQ4|5|Well made, heavy and larger than I expected (a good thing).  Should support my HI Lift jack with ease.  Would definitely purchase again but I don't believe I will have to, should last beyond my needs.
B002JAXU56|4|Color is more bluish than grey but for $11.00 I'm not going to bitch.  I think they are pretty sturdy for the price also.
B001MU5JB2|5|Excellent prodcut!!!
B0020T17J2|5|Worked as advertised. Didn't need to re-thread but ran it anyway just to be sure. Tire on garden tractor now retaining air and, after a summer of use, seems to be totally fixed. Cheaper than more expensive kits but be sure you don't have a lot to service.
B009ZSKNEG|5|Bought two to clear my roof by a foot.  Work great!
B00HU6N3LK|5|Tried this product as some other failed for my purpose, section of deeply ingrained sticky grime on a chair. Community answer also helped, when applied in high concentration and worked-in with brush it worked greatly on my problem.
B00LHKRV72|1|Did not work straight from the box. Tried reversing polarity to see if it was mislabeled also just to be sure. Leds are polarity sensitive. Still not operational. Contacted them and explained the issue with a response of you mean it no work??. Duh. When you say it is not operational it is I guess no worky worky. That was the end of communication from them over this matter. I know it was inexspensive but I work hard for my money. Your choice to waste your time and money. I would give it a minus 2 star but it starts at one. 💩x2
B000C36BIK|5|The Only Belt That Will Stop Corvette Belt Squeal!!
B00LOZGULS|5|Awesome pipes.
B00IAIG878|3|Used this product to camo my G2 Golfcart. With all the nooks and cranny's the narrow stripes worked great. Thought I could do it with 5 rolls... Took every inch of 7! The only issue I have, is some rolls came alittle short. And some were lighter or darker in color. (Can clearly see the difference) Overall pleased with the outcome of my Cart tho!!
B000NW8E94|5|Exactly what we needed. Thanks.
B0032LV2QA|1|Instead of cooling the unit started to heatup. Bad QA I guess
B00K75UFWQ|5|Used it to cover my old Cadillac in the driveway, keeps it dry and clean.
B009TC50LE|5|Unit fit fine and black color also worked out with out having to paint.
B00SXE4GI2|3|Wrong size and inadiquate provision for securing it.
B00XWDYWRE|5|Awesome awesome, someone stole my original key & dealership wanted $170 for a new key and I found one on amazon for $27:00, u can't beat that.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Awesome very bright, have it on the front of my truck and I totaled another car with my front end and the light bar didn't even crack and still works great
B010Q4PW4S|4|Smaller than I envisioned but acceptable.
B00BFE67WA|5|Is been a few weeks since it was installed and is working perfect
B00RIVNP1K|5|Great product, would buy again
B00J96X4A4|4|so far so good … used the mid size one - note I have an A7 with 20&#34; wheels … there is no place to put them in the back calipers … can only use up front … so I have extras in case that they fall later
B00DSD5HY0|4|Don't forget to apply a light layer of Windex before sticking. It helps to prevent a lot of bubbles which this sticker ks very prone to.
B0028JPECA|5|A
B004133OLE|5|Perfect fit. Easy installation.
B00DVENH84|5|Speaks for itself!
B005MVB4D4|4|Great product. Exactly what I wanted.
B00SFKMN8O|5|Works perfectly in my Toyota Highlander.  Keeps me from losing things between the seats and center console.  Blends in so you don't even see it.
B010LA0026|2|Plastic not metal
B000C123HA|5|Great duplicate of original, installed with no problem.
B007R2TSCU|5|I was told that I needed a new Catalytic Converter, running $1300+ $$$'s.  I went home, ordered the Code Reader.  When I plugged in the Code Reader, the problem was with a Evap sensor.  Repaired it, reset trouble light...Passed smog...HAPPY, HAPPY.
B00A14O8LC|5|Was pretty excited to find a replacement for my 1999 Tahoe auto 4x4. Works great.
B002713IUY|5|On my key ring!
B00JBNYYJ0|5|Does what it says
B00IP3P3L0|5|Works as expected, easy to install.
B0046M91MG|4|No these are not polyurethane flaps but I could not find any that where blue so these will do.  Thin flexable plastic that are pretty large I have a xv crosstrek suv but for cars your going to need to cut then down to size.
B00SW8TFIA|5|Awesome lights for the price
B0096BAADQ|5|I fits my car correctly. I like it.
B00BEBSUT2|5|These gloves appear to run small. I'm a normal sized woman (5'7&#34;, normal weight) but the large were too small for me. Extra large is perfect. I love how they look, and the fact that they are the same color as my jacket is a plus!
B00HE670EC|5|Bought this for my husband's white Nissan.<br /><br />The color isn't a true match, but for the few rust spots and chipped paint from rocks, it works great.
B009K6IW00|4|CANT DECIDE WHERE TO USE IT
B00JIIZCM6|5|work as stated
B006EP888Q|5|Very happy with this sub box matches my interior perfectly, and sounds great.
B000C2WFA4|5|I purchased this for my husbands 2005 Nissan Titan and it fit perfect! I used the guide provided to see which tank cap was needed and it did not disappoint. Super fast shipping and as described. Highly recommend.
B0019HXXI4|5|Worked as expected on 1999 ek3 civic<br />Honda power
B00LZQ6WWI|2|Rattled while driving and I stopped using them as a result.
B00Y5GZRU8|4|Good fit and solid feel.  It is a little pricey for what you get and the installation instructions could be easier for a fist timer not to mention that they should account for installing the jam nut under the boot.
B00AAGOPGO|2|I use a size 5 1/2 to 6 hat. The rk300 works OK, however I could never get it adjusted down to my head size. I had to by a BlueParett.
B0009H520M|5|very good item
B00WFHYQBA|5|Easy to install, noticeable increase in horsepower and fuel mileage. Went from 200+ miles per tank in the city to 340+ miles per tank. Dont do any highway driving so i have no clue what highway mileage.
B010805IIK|5|It fit and look great
B00NAVO4WG|5|This is perfect for those times you get caught needing to take a nap in your car, whether you locked yourself out of the house, get stuck somewhere, or need to take a quick snooze at a rest stop. It inflates quickly using the included cigarette lighter-powered pump and it deflates quickly, no need to use the pump to deflate. It also has a patch kit and a bag to store it in. Unfortunately there is no way to magically make the backseat of a car bigger so I was not able to stretch out my legs but it was way more comfortable than sleeping in the backseat without the air mattress--seatbelts digging into your back, legs awkwardly dangling over the edge. This provided the extra space using the bolsters, making it way more comfortable and giving me that much more room. There are also two inflatable pillows. The one thing I would change is to make the cord for the pump longer because it barely reached to the end of the mattress in my backseat. If you have a power source in the backseat it wouldn't be a problem for you. This fit good in my PT Cruiser but I did have to push the front seats forward so you wouldn't be able to use this while driving.<br />(Air mattress provided free for testing and unbiased review.)
B00E5OUOCQ|5|great item - covers the windshield, the flexible hoops allow for a good windshield fit - and I can, fold in half then just half twist it - it shrinks to 3 little hoops which slides into the pocket behind the passenger seat - don't have to mess with the carry puuch
B000CPATRM|5|Ordered for 2000 Monte Carlo to replace original lines. Worked great and look much better. Much needed upgrade.
B0016WIWXI|5|This was a replacement lock for the originally manufactured latch.  Works like a charm...easy install.
B001810SHA|1|Followed the directions exactly. Starting PSI was 30 psi. For 80 degrees ambient temperature I had to bring it closer to 50 psi. The entire first can barely brought it to 35 psi. I didn't see any leaks. Started with the second can, still following the directions of squeezing for 5-10 seconds then check the pressure. All of a sudden the pressure gauge shot up from 35 psi to over 100 psi. Now I have to take it to a shop to have the excess removed.
B00O9H0QIG|5|Great biy
B000C3F3HK|5|Just what I needed
B00BGH1XH0|5|glasses are still too small for my husband although I ordered the larger glasses
B0033WLGZU|5|Finally got the one that fits! Easy to install. I had to go to a supervisor at Amazon customer service to get them to ship me the correct item after their web site info was incorrect. But worth fighting for!
B000BGM2XG|5|Works just fine so far.  Of course it's the same model that quit working  after an unknown period of time.
B0100NFPNS|4|This item arrived and was exactly what I needed to replace a cracked panel.  Replacing the item was simple.  I'm glad I took a chance with buying the item online and moved forward with the easy installation.
B004ZF3FJO|5|I give it a 5 because I can't say anything bad. Easy install. Everything fit properly. No mods needed. Been on 2 long drives at night.operates as expected.
B00GB7XZ44|5|Heavy duty, durable. White shows dirt immediately, but that is to be expected.
B00PSST3FM|5|Perfect! Just like the picture! Thank you!
B00GSAUHB8|3|I am somewhat disappointed with this windshield protector.  Based on the picture, I thought it would be padded in the two circles over each side so the heat would be kept out better.  There is no padding.  It is just a regular type windshield protector that you can find anywhere.  I'm glad I bought it on sale.  Would not recommend it or buy another one.
B000BWCFIM|5|Didn't need but worked for my friends truck that needed them
B00PGCDFH2|5|I installed this product a week ago.  The install was completed in about 1 1/2 hours on a Sunday afternoon using hand tools.  The fit is perfect and the boards look fantastic.  I've had several people compliment them and ask me where I got them.  The iBoard is inspired by the iPhone 5 design.  It seems a bit gimmicky, but in reality, they are a very nice alternative to the ubiquitous oval &#34;fake nerf bar&#34; running boards seen everywhere.  The boards are constructed of aluminum, lightweight, hold my 275 lbs easily, and are very attractive.  I chose the 4&#34; version, which gives me plenty of stepping space without sticking out too far on the side of the truck.  If you are more concerned about stepping area, I recommend the 5&#34; version.<br /><br />Now to solve a problem I ran into.  I have a 2012 GMC Sierra.  The boards I received for the second generation (2007-13) truck mount to the body mount bolts that hold the cab on the truck.  Apparently the third generation 14 and up trucks include a kit that mounts to the factory drilled mount holes on the rocker panel.  So when asking about this product, understand you may get conflicting answers based on the model truck the respondent owns.  For the boards I got, I recommend you have a breaker bar, extension, and a large socket wrench if possible.  I had a 1/2 inch breaker bar and a 1/2 inch socket wrench.  You can use the breaker bar and extension without the socket wrench, but it will take longer.  You will have great difficulty if you attempt the install with short handled tools.  If you have an impact wrench, God bless you, I wish I did.  With the right tools, the install is very basic, follow the instructions and you will have no problems.<br /><br />I am extremely satisfied with my iBoard 4&#34; running boards and would recommend them to anyone.  I am a self-taught shade-tree mechanic and I installed them easily.  The boards look great and function perfectly.  Happy wife and kids who no longer have to hoistthemselves into the truck.  Do recommend the tools, and make sure you read reviews for the proper generation truck you own.  Good luck, you won't be disappointed!
B00F5MUB66|5|Amazing!  Like a whole different Shower
B00NDTMDEG|5|I bought a new car this year.  The visor lights didn't cut it for me.  Well these do!  My wife didn't care for them at first.  Now she loves being able to see everything!  The do light up her life.
B0045UY8I6|5|Been on my car for almost 4 years and still work great.  Awesome blades and awesome price.
B00AMPJ3D8|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 jeep liberty. Very easy to install.
B00AXXEL5Y|5|I put it on a separate surface and not the roof as Keystone told me it would void the roof warranty. It also allows me to move it to get a good southern view. Install was easy and it take about 4-5 minutes to get all &#34;locked on&#34;.  Slick.
B0071I3OY8|5|Perfect fit on my Cadillac Escalade. Almost better than stock!
B004PXWKLA|5|Nice!
B00AM3EQY6|5|8&#62; Thank You $$$ 8&#62; :D ^^
B00IH5OLJG|3|I ordered a size medium and for whatever reason it was reset  to a size XXL.
B001EP0H8A|4|This item looks nice and has a beautiful shine.  However, it does not fit a GMC Terrain OEM installed hitch.  I drilled additional holes and made it fit.  Drilling additional holes was not much trouble.  I hope this does not cause it to rust early.
B00HED84I6|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 Toyota Prius.  Easy to install and looks just like the 3 other original wheel trim rings that were still on the car.  Would recommend.
B00QFTC2QA|1|Not good our ear communication system dont fit Very cheap helmets! Not satisfied at all!
B0009IBJE4|5|worked great
B007OZ2VC4|2|It only work once, wasn't  able to rest code again
B00WMK3O7W|5|very good quality product was really excited for the backseat runner because we have kids and it is all made with thick rubber and customizable for any car wouls definetly recommend this product
B00BITIBNU|5|Great quality
B000EDOSKQ|5|b
B004I0JDBA|5|Perfect fit for my 1996 Chevy 2500 pickup.<br />Light speed shipping, Thanks
B00FKPJJNY|5|Super bright!
B0013G040G|5|fit and works fine
B00DZUCF3M|4|Lug nuts that came with were pointless they are too ugly to use on wheels. Otherwise great product so far
B000ZJT5ZC|5|Yes it was what I expected except they were a little short other than that excellent
B006E4SKQ2|5|Fits nice and tight and keeps the original upholstery from getting worn or dirty. Recommended for people who want to keep their vehicles nice and clean.
B00DJF7J9S|5|an absolute must for removing the gm shifter seal...
B005FM1066|5|Thanks for the product
B00BFP2VEC|3|Very fragile. Breaks easily.
B003CEFJ2A|5|Fits snug but good
B00UVXDIS2|4|Cute.  Used them on my classroom door.  I have a minion theme this year.
B0075OWK4I|5|These batterys gave our e300 new life.  They hold a charge well.  Very comparable to what came in scooter from factory.  A do-it-yourselfer will have no problems with hooking up to existing scooter wires.
B006MN9IWK|3|Everything fit and cut fine but the screw slot that holds it together is weak. Case broke apart the first time I used the key. Will snap back together but frequently comes apart with little effort.
B0010E3ISG|5|Fit perfect, good price.
B001NJ3H0C|5|Over one month and still works great.
B0009IK5TO|5|Fits perfectly.
B00GOFGOTQ|1|Was not even die cut! I had to try to cut it out, and it stuck to itself and got ruined before I could even get it on the car. Loved the BOJI but who doesn't make these as die cuts? Strange.
B00IQNMVWS|3|Too large for her,but she will regift.
B009NQ8HUW|5|Perfect fit and there are no leaks. Recommended.
B0049EDL8Q|5|Thank you
B001892TQK|5|Excellent Product! Very Comfortable! It was installed on an 87 Suzuki Samurai. You have to build the holes yourself but it would not take more than an hour with some patience to mount it all. It folds and tumbles great inside the Sammy.
B0050IRYRY|5|Makes my Yamaha FZ6R look so much better . We took stock signals and mounted them to each side of the fender eliminator .
B000X21WRU|3|Kind of expensive for what you get, but it fits decent.
B0009H51MG|3|Fram makes good air filters, unfortunately this one DOES NOT  fit an 08 subaru impreza.
B008FQ6DNO|5|Easiest body repair I've ever done... And a competitive price.
B000C44CK8|4|great
B00INCG1LO|5|good stuff, good price
B00873J0YY|5|Good buy,prompt shipping
B0000AY4MK|5|Looks good on truck while providing bumper protection.  Very pleased.
B00ISM4HK6|5|Quick delivery,  worked as advertised. No issues.
B000MD3EVC|3|Works great but my first one cracked and grease started coming out of the side. Replacement seems to be holding up well.
B0006JO0TC|4|Ok, I bought this for my truck that does a lot of sitting around during the summer. I work on vehicles that have similar systems on them. When they work, they work. Some of the gadgets I have in my truck tend to drain the battery, but not enough to keep it from not starting. I did get worried after installing a new electric cooling fan. I did it the lazy way; bought the thermostat controller and hooked the system directly to the battery. So the fan starts at set temp and shuts off at set temp. Of course this still runs after the truck is shut off until the truck cools down. I knew this was not a problem because if the truck was running the batteries were charging. Just had bad timing when the trucks battery started dying on me. (found out the starter decided to short out on me)<br />Well the question of the Solar Charger came back to mind. I saw good reviews for this one. Thought it would fit great on the tool box in the bed. So i bought it, installed it, and here are the results:<br />I let the battery drain a bit from my on board devices. Then tested it. Battery tested to 770 CCA. I did this about a month ago so the exact days I am not sure, but shortly after hooking up the charger  I retested the battery at 840 CCA, and it is still maintaining it at 840 CCA.<br />I would have given it that fifth star if the instructions stated you could keep this connected while driving.<br />The brand/type we use at work stay connected all the time with no known issues. I did not want to risk it with this one.
B00T1BY3D4|5|Love it!
B000JZHM3Y|5|It's high quality just as you would expect from K&N. The instructions made everything very simple, as it includes step by step installation and pictures to go with it. I put this on my 1996 Toyota Celica ST because the stock filter was cracked all the way around, and it was the best modification I've made so far.<br />Pros: It looks and sounds awesome, and adds a little bit of horsepower to your car. (The difference is felt in acceleration and high end rpms)<br />Cons: None yet<br />Overall awesome piece
B0094KKZ8Y|5|Easy install and it works perfectly.  The brake gain is oddly a small slider switch on the back left side of the unit, but once set, I'm not likely to change often, but worth considering if you haul different trailers.  Have not experienced the advanced features working, but haven't towed much since buying. It works as a good electric trailer brake.  Ease of install was the highlight - plug-n-play, self-tap screw to under-dash spot - 5 minutes, done.
B005I4PPSU|5|Bought for my husbands car and it looks great
B004V6QB9I|1|I cant believe I paid 40,00 for this useless thing.  When I exit, it comes with me.  When I enter, the only way to position it properly on my butt is to grab both handles, hold it onto my rear and sit down.  I cant even imagine what to do with it.  Maybe use it as a slider to move furniture.  Maybe as a seat at the stadium, or a boat seat!  Quite possibly I am doing something wrong, but I cant imagine.  The only parts involved are the handles, the pad itself, and my butt. Threw out the package so dont think I can return
B000CRI1C0|5|New, & working fine.
B00Y16E92O|3|Very hard to get rid of the odor.
B00E5G6BOY|1|The Flush worked Great. Don't waste your time your effort and your money on the gasket repair. It's garbage. It did not work.
B0009IQZH0|5|Great microfiber towels.
B001TXWNLQ|5|does the job. very handy tool.
B00ZR4JQBI|5|Looks awesome, I have already had a friend who spent more money on a mopar one return his and then buy this one, real easy to install just make sure you put the bottem end in first, snapped the top in first and had to pop it out and redu it as the top is the only snaps that move bottoms are solid so have to go in first. Also whish it had double side tape on the back of it so give it a more secure fit and keep water from getting back there but doesn't effect usuage as the stock one doesn't do that either.
B00HJ6O95A|3|Ok so they definitely work as described and look great at night. Although they're not perfect meaning if you look at the word Mazda and on the emblem some areas are missing for whatever reason. Probably an imperfection on the little lens or something. I give 3 stars only because it's not 100%
B001445IZ8|2|Really slow to remove oils from car.  Handle came off and cut my finger did the job finally but thought quality would be better. Disappointed.
B00O7FRRJG|4|excelente
B00HJEXEF8|5|Good quality, bright lights, fit perfectly.
B000701HF0|5|Perfect!
B00RF95TDC|5|Need a wrench to fit in the back of my C6 Corvette , works great
B00KTIYXLU|5|Works great. Easy to program.
B00SSKUHAC|5|Great item.  Toyota should offer this as part of their accessories.  Great job!
B000VL9WTS|5|Good product
B00M78820I|4|the material does cover the entire windshield. my only complaint is the wiring of the circular dishes can be longer so my visors can hold it down.
B0114HMPBO|1|The unit I recieved is defective. The steamer re-heat light comes on repeatedly every 10-15 seconds. And it took about 1 minute for it to reheat. I never got any hot steam. Sometimes it just spray streams of water. I gave it lots of patience, but finally gave up after a few hours of time wasting. I really do not like to give bad reviews but just wanted to give others heads up.
B004E3A7FC|5|Fixed my 2004 jeep wrangler heater blower problem.  The blower would not work on speeds 1 and 2.
B000C5PZP8|5|Excellent
B000BPSW7C|4|I just had a chance to use Nu Finish on my red truck. I was hoping Nu Finish could bring back to life the luster of my truck. We all know that red looks great when the vehicle is new but tends to fade as time goes by. All in all the Nu Finish did a pretty good job. It took a lot of the oxidation off the paint. The places where the paint was in good shape looks new again. I found that wiping it off quickly after applying it gave me the best results. I strongly suggest you do small sections at a time. Nu Finish dries quickly and can be difficult to remove if left on too long. I have read other reviews about the bad smell. It does smell bad but not any worse than other polishes and wax's I have used in the past. If you keep your expectations realistic I think you will be happy with this product. It will not bring back a totally failed paint job to showroom condition, but it will make your car look better.
B00UKFMVMA|5|High quality, good fit
B0002Q81W6|5|I love it
B004C1Z8DW|5|Very good
B00W2B50GE|4|This product worked like the description, however the old relay fit into the fuse block and this relay was wider so I had to cut the plastic clip so it would fit. The relay is behind the lower steering wheel panel.
B004A6JA2O|5|It fits my 2010 4Runner perfectly.  So much cheaper than a Dealership!
B00WW0AKCE|5|Great product. Great service.
B00F8Q6DLQ|4|i didnt know the low beams would be yellow
B00BTGSIA8|4|Great Towels
B000COCUF2|5|Function as expected, and a good price and fast shipping!
B0024DYM3M|5|Great mat for camping
B00G0OU4BU|5|Perfect replacement for the one that rusted through
B003K3688C|3|These are REAR pads, not front pads as shown in the photo.
B0057FJZJ0|5|This blower assembly worked perfect for my 2007 BMW 328xi and it only took my husband around 10 minutes to install. I was nervous ordering this part but i am glad i did rather than spending 300$ for the same part different brand!
B00AIBNL7A|5|Great quality.
B00S1UYH9Q|5|yes i love it!  thanks Amazon
B00I9DZ9O2|5|Took just a couple minutes to replace and looks just like it should.
B005VPS2TU|5|Comes as complete unit. Very easy to install. Works great. Dorman is usually pretty good at fixing auto manufacturer's mistakes. The OEM units crack, hopefully Dorman has fixed this issue too.
B0002JMTLW|5|Working great. The problem turned out to be the motor this time. I left this in anyway because I know they usually go before the motor. At Amazons price I would swap the switch before digging deep enough to test the motor next time too. In my experience it is usually the switch that goes bad first. Installed this switch and this motor [Dorman 742-150 Window Lift Motor ...] in a 1990 GMC van. The side I changed is about three times as fast as the other now.
B000QUTQSG|4|excellent part,perfect fit. price d right. definately a 5 star product..( i try to use that 5 star word: love, for people)
B00KIXYAUA|4|Prompt arrival. Product was a little dirty, but as they were window cranks for a vintage trailer it didn't matter
B00K6BRC9U|1|Broke the firest time I pulled with it
B00IUV7PFO|5|Great battery, good delivery and again a great battery I will buy another one if not two more thank you keep up the good work
B00EPDL6T2|5|I love my steering wheel wrap!  It dresses up my car every so sublty w/o going overboard!
B00VAVVTLW|5|I bought this for a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe.  I really like the package deal.  Didn't have to do any spring compressing which is a plus.  I also liked having new springs as well as the new struts.  And the rear shocks were just an added bonus.  Thanks Amazon.
B000E28MTA|5|Wonderful product.
B00OY3K22K|5|makes my hunter green s-10 4x4 complete and cool
B00JAQHJ8G|5|Installed on 06 Ram 3500<br />Works great, couple hour install<br />Pretty easy install<br />Truck looks great leveled!!!!<br />Great product and fair price
B00C5TA2QQ|5|Works great for my UTV trailer and Toy hauler.  Keeps it quiet.  Thanks!
B0033WNNR4|4|Perfect wiring length and easy to install. Only disappointment is the connector to the trailer is different so I have to find some sort of adaptor.
B000N37FIY|5|the valve stem and open/close valve is one unit, but it is exactly like the one i am replacing, so it works great.
B00K7938LW|3|Some of the caps fell off before long.
B00JVPTINU|5|This fits my Touareg perfectly and keeps things from sliding around.  Great value!
B00KSDSYCK|5|I love this product. I have a 2008 Tahoe and this fit great. No straps to fight with. Covers stay in place. Can be taken off with ease to wash. Will purchase this item again
B00D8L4NOC|5|I bought these bulbs hoping they'd be a little bit whiter than the other LEDs I had already used.  They are definitely whiter.  They go with my Parsam LEDs I used for the map lights and dome light in my 2016 WRX.  Not a single issue with the lights so far.
B0002KKIUK|5|98 Jag Conv. Preserves top (fabric) well. Good product.
B003BZWR4S|4|It works as it should for my DJ gigs.
B000CISMBE|1|The photo description of the part is incorrect.  The mirror I got was for an older S-10.  It was smaller and had hard corners.  Verify the part number for your truck before you purchase.  Kudos to Amazon, they are giving me a full refund.
B0049IZ3J2|3|Does not sit properly, rocks back and forth
B000BZLEMW|5|Great product definitely oem alternative works fine and price point is grear
B013EUFRYQ|5|These socks are a favorite in our household. I bought some on a whim last year for my youngest daughter and fell in love with them. They are very soft and are excellent quality. We have the ones I bought last year and they still look like new.
B007IKOX7Q|5|Quick nice
B0080HJL7S|5|I love this car garbage bag from RINO CAR GEAR. With this great garbage bag, my car is very clean, no more soda cups, napkins, receipts or any kind of garbage laying under the seats or floor. I fill up on gas about twice a week and it is easy to emptying rhino bag out while at the station. The bag has quick-release buckle which makes it easy to remove to clean, then re-hang and re-use.I was able to tighten and tuck the strap easily under my passenger seat's headrest, providing easy access from the driver's seat in my car. I love the fact that it is fully leak proof and i don't have to worry about the little bit coffee or soda which i always leave in them. The capacity of the bag is 3 gallon, which is a lot.Furthermore the trash bag has spring frame opening which stays closed when not in use to keep trash out of sight. At-last if you aren't satisfied with the trash bag you can return it and get your money back within 1 year,<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping: It was packed nicely in a plastic bag. The shipping was also very fast. I received the trash bag in two days after placing the order. The price is also very reasonable, luckily i bought it at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am glad that i did, now my car is clean, trash free.I wish i found this years ago.I highly recommend this trash bag from Rhino Car Gear, this trash bin will instantly help you keep your car clean and you'll never again spend hours cleaning up the garbage left on the floor or seats of your car. Below are few pictures of the trash bag that i took when i first received it.
B002OJBNJC|3|what i received is not what is pictured.
B000GAOT88|5|My son loves it
B00THR0GRO|4|Easy to install. Better to buy it new instead of a junk yard as they become fatigued.
B00GKHI6AS|5|Exactly what I needed.
B000E2CVI8|5|The 17mm nut on the end is  brilliant!
B000IZ1JNY|1|Definitely was not the right kind of brake pad for my vehicle. I wish I would have know that when shopping instead of after removing my old brakes. There needs to be a better verification system for the Garage feature.
B00GYTEE9O|5|Been using these for years!
B001KQF6RA|5|Worked great
B000KYYIDQ|5|Working properly -- very good.
B005M2262Q|4|Worked great.  It fit perfectly.
B00852684M|1|Sucks.
B000C59LO4|4|Fit my Dodge Dakota perfectly. Seem to be working as designed. The rubber bushings are a bit smaller than the OEM. I kept the new ones but I used the old ones since they seemed more substantial.
B00MWZCOSM|2|Fit my 2014 grizzly 450 but the fan was wired backwards so it would only turn on with the key off
B00G6EWGJW|1|So after so long,  I have seen what buying cheap will do.  6 months and I am replacing lights.  Not all (yet). But most including the reverse lights. some flickered, 1 didn't work out of the box.  So if you can't afford a lot they may work.  But if you can,  buy better lights over time.  It will work a lot better.
B000C9Y1EA|1|I received a plastic filter and a rubber gasket. NOT AS PICTURED. Returned upon receiving.
B003H0W0RG|5|Installed easily, works perfectly.....My Miata is grateful. Great product.
B004BWFKHG|5|I normally don’t write a review.. but these boot are special.  I ride a BMW 1200 GS. These boots are a perfect cross between a dirt MX and street boot.  The leather is 30% thicker than a street leather so it takes a few days to break them in, but it’s MX leather quality.  They are not waterproof so you need to oil them.  I was thinking of giving them a 4 star because they don’t have a shifter patch, but they are so comfortable you can walk around in them all day long!
B002UCYRYQ|5|Works good
B00B4ZFGBS|5|Minor cutting of plastic on drivers side underside. Everything lined up perfectly for an easy fit.
B00A6G5R4W|5|Very good models
B00KIDKZKY|1|Item came on time. These actuator is defective, you have split second to open the door. Once you push the remote to open, the actuator bounce back to close position. You sold me garbage product from china. Not happy at all.
B000C2SGU2|4|Arrived as promised.. Exactly what my mechanic needed... He was super impressed with the Sunday delivery...great price
B00QQX1KTK|1|This would look good if they would have taken the  neoprene &#34;Plastic&#34; white liner off and cleaned it has a sticky film all over it used window cleaner on it took me 25 min to clean it up
B00860PK1K|5|Solid made roof bars that are easy to fit and look stylish when in place. Initially I thought that the L-wrench to affix them was missing but then found that each bar stores one L-wrench in the right foot so you never lose it. Also comes with 4 keys to lock the covers. A nice touch was to include 4 small stickers to attach inside the top of the door frames This means you only have to measure where to put the bars once as it's quick to identify where to place the bars when subsequently refitting them.
B00CKJZCO8|5|Fix great
B004BTAJ2A|4|Super Sporty but not comfy..
B00V94TXFE|5|Seems to the do the job perfectly and thats what Im looking for.
B00CIV14Y0|5|They even called me to make sure what kind of center console I had! Got them in one week excellent quality and fit, I set them in the sun for a while and went on very well .... it is a  tight fit, look like factory seats. I was a little leary of the &#34;shower cap&#34; console lid cover, but after a few weeks I love it. Very Good Fit ... Very Well Made in Utah!
B000L9AD2K|5|Let's face it, all these compressors are basically cheap junk. That being said, I bought this exact model six years ago for about $25 and it served me well during that time. I damaged the power connector so that it no longer plugs into the cig lighter. Rather than bother trying to fix it, which would take a coupe hours of my time, I decided to just buy another one.<br /><br />Positives: Very long power cord (~10ft)<br />Negatives: PSI meter is very inaccurate
B00DGXVX18|4|Good product, no issues so far
B00YV5FF32|5|Now my info doesn't get lost in glove compartment
B0009JKI7W|5|New windshield wipers are always a pleasure. They make rainy days quiet and streak-free! This old-school model definitely gets the job done -- good quality at the right price for something that needs replacement every year. The instructions printed on the package were completely unhelpful, but a quick YouTube video soon showed me how to install.
B000F285EQ|5|Keeps everything snug
B00HRGUSW0|5|very nice. great price compared to factory rack
B000M5YZKO|5|Works great and cheap, just the way I like it.
B00SUVQNE8|5|Arrived exactly when it supposed to very happy thanks
B004I1CX9I|4|this was a perfect replacement part and came with all the bulbs and wires
B001NGB57M|3|Unfortunately, it did not work miracles for the rusty tank
B002DQGV6Q|3|Seems to work great for the price a nice scale
B00MYHE13Y|5|Great for trips
B000EVYGZA|5|Everything worked as advertised - no complaints.  And the price is great!
B0006HJVF2|5|Great product, easy installation. Made ale difference in handling. Eliminated almost all of the sway. No more fighting the wheel when passing a big rig.
B004GELAS2|4|Great product, looks and feels like the oem. Only issue with the handle is the color does not match.
B00BD4N892|5|They fit perfect and installation easy.
B000CMCYYQ|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B007PKD91K|5|Awesome!
B001HATY36|5|Great price, fast delivery. Exactly as viewed. Thanks
B00DWVN08I|2|loose fit,,not cool if i end up losing this.
B00NUDZKWW|1|This sun shade does not stay deployed, very flimsy. My  visors do not hold it up.<br />Would not recommend.
B00JM5ZGWG|5|Looks and fits great, a lot better than expected since it's a brand new traverse (2015) direction s could of been a little better but no complaints at all.
B00AWYC0PM|3|New great too much sun faded them
B00AB2IDZQ|5|Definitely changed the trucks look and completed what I am going after, between the tail lights and these plus fitment I could not be happier!!
B0049KXF4A|4|Great product
B009EVJC3C|5|Works perfect for upgrading Jeep jk from h13 to H4 bulbs with Cibie light housing.
B000V5SX6M|3|Actually, I think it would have been a very good rack but it was missing parts (including the key which prevented unlocking a bracket for installation). No problems with returning it however and I just ended up getting a Yakama rack from a local outfitter.
B00A7WAHTU|5|Works great on my Suzuki motorcycle, no more cam-out.
B008G28KGK|4|The fit was good. To save money I did the replacement myself. There are lots of videos on the internet to walk you through it. If you are doing it yourself, definitely buy a bag of Honda 10mm Hole Plastic Push Rivets. You will probably break one or two when you remove the old ones, especially the ones that are underneath the car. You can get by with a screwdriver or also buy a Lisle 35260 Plastic Fastener Remover. Both the rivets and remover are available on Amazon so you can order it all with the lights. Afterwards you may also have to adjust the aim of your headlights, once of again lots of help on walking you through that on the internet.
B00353M08E|5|MUST HAVE FOR ANY COLD AIR INTAKE ON ANY VEHICLE NO MATTER WHAT.
B0010X5KPG|5|Works great.
B000FW2NEY|5|excellent wheel cover.  excellent fit and finish.  very easy install/uninstall for positioning.  very classy cover.  outstanding value.
B00881EQ1C|5|Like it
B00MZUTHVQ|5|Fast shipping. Worked.  Happy son.
B00GHT6SF4|5|Great Product and excellent price!!!
B00MNTA9I4|5|Perfect cover.  Fits, was easy to install and easy to work with.  Priced right, too!
B00A9W55EK|1|The fuel pump had a connector on it that made it not fit into the fuel pump assembly. Would rate 0/5 if I could.
B00146A23Y|5|good quality, bright & noticeable to stick on my friend's cars :)))))))
B001VDXMDW|5|Great helmet!
B004I145P8|5|Passed inspection! Easy to install yourself, came with lights already in place. Took 5 minutes for me to swap out, and it'll make your car look so much better, not to mention drastically decrease your chances or running right into a deer in the country.
B000IG3JJA|4|Made my truck look new again
B00NEL6HT0|5|Although Amazon currently says that it won't fit a 2012 Scion tC, it did when I added it to my wishlist, the K&N application guide says that it does, and it's the same size as the Toyota filter that was in the car, part number 87139-YZZ20 (part 87139-YZZ08 is the same size).<br /><br />I have spring and fall allergies, and changing out the cabin filter seems to do a lot to cut down on allergy attacks.  I had been using Fram cabin air filters at about $15 each.  Although the up-front cost of the K&N filter is quite high, the washable filter should pay for itself within a few years.  I've had washable filters before.  The process of cleaning and re-oiling is really easy.<br /><br />I /may/ have noticed a slight odor when using the defroster, but I can't for certain say that it was out of the ordinary, and I would not say that it was offensive.
B007BWW9VS|4|Flip case is great but the VW decal is subpar cheesy and misaligned.
B00514BKE0|5|Prefect fit and looks good.
B00AW02164|4|These mats are good but they are a little light in weight  The driver side and passenger side should be heavier/thicker or have grips underneath them because they slip all the time. Thank you
B00I82GQNW|5|It was a perfect fit
B003CJG7EY|5|Looks good on  bike
B00PFNTCQ0|1|Slips and slides while I drive and ends up in my lap.  Yes, this was ordered for me, the driver.  Have to return them since they do not serve the purpose.
B00J0FSSE6|5|Nice product, prompt delivery. I received exactly what I expected. Also applies very easily.
B00MTHPAN4|4|work good
B00U6G6F4I|4|Love the look they give the car. Would recommend changing the halogen bulbs to xenon for an even sassier evening look!
B0002Q7ZKK|5|I love it
B0043OV0IA|5|All the items I ordered make my life much easier, and are very good quality.
B0023V9NK2|4|Just like OEM.
B002ERYXNC|4|not too bad of an install, but 40 minute estimate is a joke.  took me a few hours but it works great although i just mount a bike rack to it.  i probably won't be towing anything.
B0001EXBQ0|5|Installed in 5 minutes. Installed before a 500 mile trip, solid and stylish!<br />Wish I installed much sooner.
B003LRVLPM|5|Works so far for my 2013 range Rover Sport Autobiography
B001AY2WLU|5|Bought 2 of these for my Grandsons.  They love them and they are a very good tool.
B00JKSP41S|4|A fine starter for the lawn tractor and priced to fit any budget.
B00M7DRCJA|5|What else can I say. They are perfect and the black looks better than the factory gold color on my white truck.
B00V30J86I|2|This item is too small to fit between the seats.  Tried, but couldn't get it to work in our car.  Might be ok in a small auto.
B008NO5TD8|5|fit well, works well, easy install
B00UZ702CO|1|It's small and doesn't fit my 2015 F150's console.  In fact I don't think it would fit any trucks console.
B0042H6BA0|5|Arrived as promised and looks to be a quality piece of gear.  I haven't tried it on the road but look forward to doing so.  I will use the bag in the bed of my truck to protect luggage and other travel necessities to keep from cluttering up the cab.
B001RQIUZ8|4|Other than the lamp that went bad quickly  great fit function well
B0040CTUAA|4|Needed to fix a cracked windshield washer pump and needed a few of these to replace some of the original ones that shattered when I took off the parts needed to get to the pump.  Worked well for not being OEM.
B00TPI5ZKS|5|The product was perfect ,arrived on time price was good.
B00LV18KWM|5|using this  my suv and it works great when I'm using trailer
B00802GIW4|4|Awesome hid light. Easy to install. Color is great. Just a hint of blue.
B000CP895Q|4|This is about the closest Ford Corporate Blue, the medium engine block blue for 69-70 Ford Mustang engine block paint without having to go to a special paint store to mix a quart of PPG/Ditzlar DAR 13358...which will not be available if you live in California that bans the sale and use of automotive arcrylic enamels, the good stuff, and don't even try to use water based on an engine block, guarantee it will peel off.  I'm going to say this color is just slightly darker, perhaps little more purpleish than the DAR 13358, which is the trueist Ford Corporate Blue, but you're not going to find anything closer in color that comes in a rattle can.  If you do, let me know and post it up.
B0024E62OI|5|Works great.
B000N8K2TS|5|I've had my Superduty for years, why didn't i get this sooner?! People may be turned off by the price point but its MADE IN THE USA! And it really really works, i live in a hot arid climate, during the summer months the Covercraft UVS100 really keeps my truck much cooler and will  keep my dash from being sun beaten. Just buy it and you will see for yourself.
B00FOKOKM0|5|Amazing product recently bought some used leather couxhes that had scratch marks all over the seats applied the balm and buffed out and the couches looked brand new will for sure buy again
B000BZJ9Q0|5|excellent part exact fit for what i needed my car thanks you Amazon!!
B00O4CW8U0|5|Excellent. Built very well.
B00EDFM6R8|5|great in camper, same brightness and color as old bulbs
B002FKHN9O|5|Great tire.
B002FR7SCY|5|Received sooner than promised and exactly what I needed.
B00FJODJGE|5|Authentic Mazda product. Very sharp looking on Mazda 3..
B0062OHYFW|5|Awesome.  Since everyone in my office has the same laptop, I used it to differentiate mine.
B00GDEOSCS|5|Great 5
B0007XXTVC|5|A plus exactly what I needed, quick shipping
B0013REXO8|5|Look great, extremely simple to install!
B00HQLD1XY|5|Perfect!
B00P2D3VZG|5|I have put LED's throughout my car.  I bought these as my interior lights.  I bought two sets of these lights.  3 of 4 look good.  One is a different color.  It's bright!  But different color.
B00HEPH26O|1|The cannisters size was grossly inadequate ....I would not recommend this product, total  waste of money.
B0074MNGOY|5|Wonderful!<br />Thank you very much! Got my 1994 Kawasaki ninja ZX600e up and running like a charm!<br />Came clean, polished, with all the facets, and even came a day early! 10/10 thanks a bunch, Caltric!
B004GF0J88|4|Part shipped and arrived quickly. It showed up in good condition. It dit the Jeep well, it just didn't have the lamp sockets in it - not a big deal, as i was able to use the ones out of my old one, but i guess i didnt realize it didnt have them. Oh well - still happy w/ the purchase overall. :)
B00B2YTV1W|5|EXCELLENT LED PUT OUT ON TOP OF MY VEHICLE AND APPEARS TO BE AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I RATE THIS PRODUCT WITH 5 STARS.
B007J4706C|5|Exact fit extremely easy to install.  I'm very happy with it.
B009DJS93O|5|Fit perfectly
B00PSMQX2O|5|Excellent product, take out everything.  But buy it from Walmart for $3.99 a can
B002V0NG0I|5|best thing ever, took my spouse less than 40 mins to install.....Love these!!!
B00LHW2HQU|4|As expected.
B005CLQ3RQ|5|Worked great, fit well, installed in minutes on 2005 Tundra SR5. No complaints.
B00RVH6YZU|5|Fast delivery, item fitted perfect and great customer service. Will buy again with confidence
B001AWU6KQ|5|Nice accessory, easy to install in front seat, back is a little harder due to the sound/ light bar. Holding up fine 3mo later.
B00AW17SNO|5|fit perfectly in my car
B00316K61S|5|Have not used it. It's big, though. Good build quality.
B00540RHMU|1|I do not recommend this product to anyone. The quality of this product is s***ty and does not!!! hold its stick. Do not buy!! Waste of your money.
B00HQQZ1CS|5|Perfect on time!!!!!!
B00G3Z3TMM|5|Been using Fram filters for years.  They are a great value!
B007AKZSI2|5|Excellent quality, highly recommended
B004JPQASI|2|Pretty cheap made,rubs dash and can not put visor down very far
B000C7TU52|5|It was in excellent shape when we got it and the tool to take the old fittings off was great.
B00ISF8KTM|5|Fit perfectly. These are very well made and the leather is very durable.
B00YGBNIPI|5|nice!
B003E7LJN8|5|Phenomenal. Fit very well on my '95 YJ for a great value / quality. The long line from the proportioning valve to the rear axel looked complicated to install without bending or cutting but it is rather possible in one piece - don't fear it, do it! Installed when Jeep got lifted, would do it again sooner without wasting time on trying to save old lines and corroded fittings.
B009332HWY|5|Very quiet product.
B0073X74X8|5|Love it! fits great. Just what I needed it.
B000BUTDCA|5|Works as described. Glad to have this so that we can hook up our 30-amp RV at 50-amp sites.
B002UD0GFE|5|Good cleanery
B00VPRIXGU|5|thank you A+++++++++++
B00YMU9FMI|5|arrived quickly, item was just as described.
B00379ABX2|4|Paper Quality is good.
B00E1SLT4I|3|Ok rotors and pads, their claim as &#34;other guys&#34; is bull as far as more slots and thickness. I have experience with em. The rotors rust up pretty fast and I have 24&#34; Crome wheels and those rotors makes em look bad. I seen other rotors which have barely any rust on em even after couple years of use. Callahan needs to do something about the rust issue until then I'd say don't buy these unless you seriously can't afford some better brand. Good luck.
B00HTP8N0I|5|nice
B0089UEOKA|1|Don't buy this. Mine never stopped leaking even with new gaskets. I am a technician at a Toyota Dealership and think this is poorly made. Not happy.
B0121KGE3I|5|Works and looks great.
B000C8ZAVY|4|works, different than OEM, but works.
B0043GZDPO|5|Excellent.
B004YESNX4|4|This handle still uses plastic for critical area. However, the old one lasted 16 yrs in FL heat.
B000S2QVYE|5|Nice set of wires. Easy to install.
B008FA0UXO|2|Didn't fit
B00DU24YKW|5|Absolutely no problems. Works well so far.
B00GYTEDRW|3|This will not fit a 2014 Mazda 3. It is the wrong part.
B00VFF0PDG|4|I wish the teeth on the gears were a little more squared, as is they are a bit rounded, but otherwise they look great.  Applied it to a new computer case side window for my new PC I'm building for &#34;Fallout 4&#34;  I went applied it to the inside of the case window, so it'd be glossier.  Applied the others to my car side rear windows!
B009O4DAXM|5|Work pretty good easy to put in
B0079QRRRM|5|Great looks, not sure how easily it scratches... love it
B00K7938O4|5|As advertised!
B003ZJ2HMM|5|Fits nicely on my 2011 4Runner!  Looks good too!
B002YCE5V2|5|Works great
B0024E6ZW2|5|Provides excellent support for the steps when they are down.  Also helps to reduce/eliminate any side to side rocking on my 5th wheel.
B006JD481Y|5|Good
B007D5480S|5|This was a perfect fit for my Toyota Prius and very, very easy to install. I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to create a bike rack setup for their Prius.
B000BUOSGG|5|Good
B008UXZRFM|5|Perfect fit! Makes the front end of my 03' 2500 look a lot cleaner! Takes maybe 30 mins to install, you'll need a small punch to knock out the old fasteners and a drill with 3/16&#34; bit.
B00JN0U4SQ|1|This item does NOT work as well as the stock antenna and in my opinion the looks are not worth the loss of functionality.
B007UT9TYW|4|If you have to replace the pins , this is a good set.
B00OQS8GC6|4|This was for my Nissan pathfinder 2006. The original rear glass shocks failed where the window would not stay up. Bought this set and they fit just fine and hold/pick up the window just fine. My query is that the metal spring on the glass side of the shock does not really stay in place once locked in. As the window opens up, the top part kind of swivels causing the locking mechanism to come loose. If i open the glass window a few times it will clearly shuffle its way down to the open position. Luckily, i rarely open the glass window so its not a big deal. Had this happen on the main door then i would have returned it but at present, and for the price, i will end up keeping it.
B00MIZT7OK|5|This thing is super cute and super deadly. Highly recommended.
B00PBO0Z3M|5|Just as described came with headlamp bulbs.
B000NS1JOK|5|Straight oem this part got me out of a headache.thanks
B003PDP964|5|Genuine BMW key case, brand new, great price.  What more could you ask for?
B00IVQMTW2|5|IF you have a CV style joint you need this to keep out dust and debris. Note: be sure that you tap the slinger all the way down in the seat.
B00MWNZ4LS|2|wipers aren't smooth when clearing water from the windshield . they drag and skip as if they aren't smoothed edged . they skip areas of the windshield when removing water
B003IS3HV0|4|The product results were very nice. I didn't feel sticky sitting down after 2 hours and I didn't wipe off any extra after the 2 hours. You do have to put in a little elbow grease to get it spread out. I tried warming the bottle in hot water before use and it helped a little, but not much. It was hard to get an equal amount spread over the surface of a couch cushion. I won't be using very often,  but it did look nice than before I put the product on.
B00B2ATB6G|1|Product did not match the image in the display.
B00A6RL3MG|5|Perfect match and eazy to install.
B0029TQDLA|5|It works just as advertised. It's more convenient than using the semi-plastic placard by itself.
B00NOGIJX2|3|I had bought two of the regular sized Wondergel cushions for my husband that he loves but he wanted a bit larger one for his car seat. I ordered this one thinking it would be the same construction but just bigger but he said it was too hard and not the same at all.
B00B1VBQRS|4|All of the Royal Purple brand products are top of the line stuff.  I don’t really have the equipment to properly test this but I can say that it was packed well, sealed cap, and sent in a sealed plastic bag in case it was damaged.  My engine is running fine and I took it on a 12 hour drive to NC Outer banks with no issues.  I have been putting this in my 2000 Mustang GT twice a year for a few years now.  Once at the beginning of summer and then again mid summer.  The car runs great and this does seem to help after it has been sitting all winter.  I would definitely purchase this again.
B0041MVQ4M|2|Backing came off after only using it twice
B009DKYVTE|5|Worked as advertised.
B00CG0IXCE|1|the foam maybe lasted a good month and it fell off and left the sticky foam behind on my car. really disappointed
B000FQ01TE|5|Work perfect easy to mount on my Chaparral boat
B00UE4CQR2|4|nice tool doesn't come with enough adapters.
B005J5D062|5|As advertised. Prompt delivery with detailed instructions.
B00ADIHUVG|5|Bought this and the CTEK 3300. This is an excellent combination for an XK Jaguar or any car with a battery in the trunk. The cable from the battery is a little short and this extension cable make life much easier. The product is well made and comes with dust cover when not in use.
B008XNZZ7O|4|This stuff works great! I am a big fan!
B00FQ0RH8W|1|This part failed after 6 months.
B0066TL42C|5|Came early and exactly as advertised
B000C2WFA4|5|Came as dicribed and as expected
B000BUU5XG|5|Nice design and fits great. Took a minute to install the adapter and another two minutes to put it up and install suction cups for stability. No more exhaust blowing into neighbor's patio or under my coach into my patio.
B006GWVBQ8|5|I was hesitant to buy this product since I had never heard of this company. I was pleasantly surprised! Works great on our PWC cleans and removes water spots with ease and leaves a great sealant behind. It is a little pricey but a little goes a long way. The 32oz bottle is really nice over a 16oz that many other products come in. Will buy again!
B00IPS3G96|4|Its motor oil. It works.
B00ARUPXTQ|5|fits perfectly
B00H1I639Q|5|These worked out great.
B00EKEGRVS|5|Works perfectly to hold and protect my sunglasses. Very easy to use.
B00ANPLLRS|5|exactly as described. A very useful assortment.
B002BHRXJ6|4|It took a few frustrated tries to find the right size side for our window a/c unit but once we stuck with one we thought fit the best and took our time lining up the blades the tool did exactly as promised for which I am glad because I really didn't mean to push in all the blades when carrying the air conditioner into the house. Caution, wear gloves while using.
B00L2PSLVM|4|Very cool thing. Just remember that if you hear your engine turning while riding with engine off,the chain is to tight. This really made my bike a lot quieter.  And no it does not need a stronger spring. It would make the chain to tight.
B000C1OX00|5|Oem for honda pads.  No squeaks.  Book daily driver brake pads
B004FRN89Y|5|Best grease gun I have owned !
B00BHQ8QCK|1|Random flags, they make no sense, I am returning them.
B00B9W4HHA|5|great stuff, works great..
B00OX1WIT8|1|Straps tore within one week of use. Very poor value.
B00NPY02EW|4|it is a great product
B00U8HUMTO|5|Great buy!!
B011P4DQBY|4|I am a car nut and when I was in college I used to spend my weekends waxing and claying my car. Nowadays, time is at a premium, so its great that there are liquid was alternatives . This Joyride product works well- Its easy to apply, wipe off and leaves a nice shine behind. I tested pouring water on top of it and the water beaded nicely. I take a star off because part of the plastic applicator broke during shipping. Perhaps the product should come in a box or bubble wrap as Amazon's bubble bags didn't seem to be enough.
B007NEUQH8|2|Frame obscures tags in lower corners of plate, and OR law states &#34;Tags/Stickers must be readable on license plates and plate frames must not cover them.&#34; Should only be used in states where one plate's tags are permitted to be hidden
B0040CTYAQ|5|Not much to say.<br />They were exactly what I needed & received them quickly.
B002Z5VIS6|5|They fit on my camper tires just fine
B000JLNBW4|3|Cheap - not so cold cooler....
B00JQ5RBXE|5|They are great
B0118LV3WI|5|These worked perfect for putting fatty bars on my 2001 Yamaha YZ250. Very nice quality as well.
B0010DW5ZO|5|I have been using the Fram air filters for several years now.  Reasonably priced and well made.
B000S2MJGI|1|i goot this item looking realy good but when i installed it it was leaking. had to reused my old one thank goodness it was still good.
B00KIF2UUK|5|fit perfectly to my car
B001O09RWC|5|Easy install, just remember to catch the nuts inside the wheel well when unscrewing the existing filter housing. Removing the existing air sensor is easier then you have unhooked the existing tube, you'll be able to see the little nub you need to press to unscrew the air sensor.<br /><br />After hooking it up, take a test drive to heat up all the parts; hear the howl of the air intake with WOT (Wide Open Throttle); come back, check the connections, and things are done.<br /><br />Not sure if i have measurable fuel savings with this installed - that sound of the intake is just too good, and yeah, you'll waste some gas doing that ;-)
B00COOSGBU|5|Works great with no issues
B003BL1H0M|5|Worked very well although the screws are a little difficult unless you have a really long drill bit. I didn't so I had a local customs shop screw it in for me.
B00LLLIXJ2|5|use it every day, decent price.
B00MFRHGDK|5|fit perfect
B004RCP6HE|4|Good quality, works well and looks good.  A bit of a hassle to unfold and get placed correctly so my wife avoids using.
B007TYCXO6|5|Bolt in good!
B00B621EV0|5|They are a custom fit for my 2011 Edge Limited, I like the way the drivers side snaps in place & the full fit in the back from side to side, They're easy to wash & clean.
B00029KA8G|4|Great quality. Takes a while to install so bring your patience.
B008F07OMO|5|Replaced factory lid on a 2000 Silverado!!  Didn't have cloth trim but this lid matched up and looked really nice!!
B002NUABUO|5|Thanks!!!
B00L949ONA|5|The package arrived sooner than I expected and everything was packaged well. The side steps are great. The quality is fine and they look good on the truck. I like them better than the factory steps because they don't have the plastic end caps and are $170 cheaper. Luckily I read some of the reviews so I anticipated having issues with the brackets. I had to switch two of them from the drivers side to the passengers side and then they fit perfectly. All of the hardware was intact and I had no problems with the bolts or washers that were provided. I would highly recommend the bars, but take your time with the placement of the brackets.
B00874A6A0|5|Perfect
B00GHT5XVY|5|Great quality
B00BFE3H6O|5|Fits great!
B000AM8BF4|5|Ordered to replace and old unit. Works great.
B00CZDOFU6|5|Perfect. Just peel off and put on. If ur about jdm get these
B007TKJMB2|5|The big fit works nicely with my RV. It's water resistant and keeps my RV from rain and debris. It's really simple to set up so it's not a hassle putting it on or taking it off. Pretty convenient and a good price for it since I haven't had any problems after using it for many months.
B00IV50JTS|4|Back flow could be a little more. But still works good
B000ZARVFM|5|Love them!  I have an 05 Jeep Liberty they fit wonderfully and super easy to put on.
B00REZPLEE|1|Not the greatest short to wear mountain biking. It is made of great material and feel god except one irritating flaw. The tag on the back warning its wearer of the hazards of biking wears the skin on your back raw. I had to cut it off, but couldn't get it off. The stitches are far too rough. Come on Man!
B000SNK7HK|5|Love it. Works great!
B0066RNYXG|5|good quality
B00SF519TI|5|marvelous
B003RW1AMK|4|Excellent product!
B00GOR6098|5|It worked perfectly, saved myself 100 dollars<br /> Thank you
B00265FXTA|5|For the price, can't beat it, other places want at least 3-4x more.  My 2008 VW Passat 3.6 4motion has the adaptive xenon headlights, I had an occasional flickering problem on my right side, very annoying to drive at night like this.  I first switched out the ballast from one side and the other, still same problem.  Next I pulled the bulb and discovered it had a little crack on the wire's insulator.  I replaced it with this new one, and now it works good as new.  Since I had to remove my entire front facia in order to pull out the headlight housings to access the bulbs and connector, which was a big hassle, I decided to replace both bulbs since I was in there.  I thought at first the color was slightly on the yellow side as a few others had mentioned, but comparing it side to side to my wife's Audi A4 with the OEM HID's, the color is spot on with the OEM's 4300K.  I probably prefer the 5000k color better though if the price is the same.<br /><br />I posted a few pics of my original Philips on the left, and this Sylvania Osram on the right.  They are nearly identical in every way.
B00SO35EWE|5|Love it!
B00AFZQIIS|4|very clean simplel to iinstall
B000CIREPE|1|It cracks. If you pull something out of your truck it snags. The glue gave up and the thing fell off. Don't buy this.
B00YSZKNP0|2|Needs to be thicker and made better, very cheap quality, poorly made product
B00FP0LHA2|1|Bought 3 of these, one didn't work when I received it, the other quit working after a week. Only one still working.
B004WO8VLA|5|I replaced the factory installed shocks on my 2001 Chevy Blazer with a set of Gabriel shocks. The Gabriel shocks were adequate, but did not provide the comfort that I expected for a premium shock, as was advertised. Within 2 years (under normal highway driving conditions- ~ 15,000 miles), the Gabriel shocks were worn and busted. Consequently, I purchased a set of Bilstein shocks (24-014120) through Amazon as a replacement. After installing these shocks, I noticed an immediate difference in the comfort and ride of my Blazer. In fact, the difference was night and day in terms of the handling, comfort, and smoothness of ride offered by the Bilstein shock absorbers. The Bilstein shocks were far superior in all aspects and I am extremely pleased with these shocks. For the price, I highly recommend them. I couldn't be happier.
B00U590RYA|5|Exactly how i thought they were going to be. The stickers are very hihh quality and seem very durable, have yet to put them on but i know they will be great!
B00SVGSDWM|5|Great product! Seller is customer friendly and provide fast shipping. I will definitely be making more purchases in the near future.
B00KJGPMZI|5|Awesome!! My 11 year old did the setup for our trip. Incredibly clear and functional. Highly recommend.
B0055ALICY|5|strong plate frame
B00QQ40PIG|4|works great, program doesn't like windows 7, but I found an alternate program
B008JQ9LDY|4|The base served me well in my 2500 dodge ram 5.7 hemi engine.<br />They need to change the publication, because if used also for this truck.<br />I recommend it because it is good quality.
B007XZXJTE|5|Easy to snip excessively long edges after you put it on.  Looks much better than the tape version, this looks and feels like your real tail light.  There are enuf sheets to double apply but u wont need to.  Sheets are big, thick, sturdy and rain wont unstick them.  2nd time I bought them with in 7 years.  They never wore out or came off but after so many years, the air pollution turns them smokey grey. The old ones came off without fuss leaving no risidue at all.  Good price.
B000C5409U|5|U get what u pay for!!  Moog is a no brainer whe. It comes to replacement parts. Dont wast time with cheeper crap
B00757KJTI|3|Fits and looks great.  But, it dramatically reduces reception.  5 stars on looks .......1 star on functionality.
B00BITJCKQ|5|That part perfectly fit good on Nissan Sentura car , working good now
B007ETDEOY|4|fits elantra 2005 rt rear except must transfere your old e-brake brake bracket  to this rebuit one.other than that fits great..
B002G47GE6|5|Fit my 2012 Golf TDI
B002OJ9YR0|5|easy install
B0000AXR5O|5|as advertised
B00WDZ43R6|3|Ok for a backup but does not open automatically cause of a weak spring.
B00KXZYQQ6|3|Didn't keep the vehicle as clean as I thought they would.
B000E7YP7I|4|Smaller than I thought but super rugged. And doesn't budge!
B000E3GHGE|3|Returned, didn't fit Toyota Corolla 2013
B002ZTGLFC|5|Works perfectly.
B00NLN87BM|5|Simple installation, look and work great!
B00DOMYNDG|4|Ran a little smaller than I like, but aside from that, the quality is good, I have been through more than one ugly time wearing this suit and it has performed great.
B006WPQNB2|5|Advice: don't let the level turn red to dump. What happens: gasses will push some liquid out from the preasure relieve escape.  Product is great, we still have not needed to replace batteries that came with.
B006C0S2MK|5|These work as expected. Highly recommended.
B00LNNR9GG|4|For the money I am happy with the foglight bulbs for my 2014 f150. They definitely are a bright white color and look really good, but in my opinion they don't project much more if any more than the stock halogens. I would recommend.
B00K73X020|4|When the package first arrived the set screws for the mounting hardware were missing, all but one. The light itself seems sturdy, and works great. Looks great as well. Only complaint is after a good carwash the light showed signs of moisture entering the housing. The inside corners fogged up. Other then that its a pretty good deal.
B00F53E2HE|5|The Suspa spring strut was perfect for the replacement on my camper shell door.
B00KTHYDA2|5|Got these as my 4Runner didnt come with them. Took about 10 minutes to program them. The instructions are easy to follow and you will have a set of remotes for your vehicle in no time.
B00YX5MP5Q|5|Awesome! Rode with these all day, didnt irritate my eyes or skin at all, very comfortable and absorbs sweat well. Clear and wide range of view. 10/10 would buy again.
B00KSXX9U2|1|Absolute garbage.<br /><br />First set: one bulb burned out in an hour. Bulb 2 came apart and began to melt inside the housing. Have since had a stain inside the housing. I requested a replacement and stated my concerns.<br /><br />Replacement set: Didn't fit in the housing (too loose). Made them fit with a headlight washer. Passenger bulb died the next day and melted the wire on the plug.<br /><br />These are NOT quality bulbs and not worth my time or damage to my car to try a 3rd set.<br /><br />(Did I mention I ordered 5000k and they were bluer than the 6000k bulbs I replaced them with? Not even close to as described)
B003WOZOUM|5|great
B000LEPT5G|3|It worked fine, I just wished that the instruction manual was more specific, because it could have saved me a trip to the dealer.  Otherwise, I would have posted it much higher.  It is a very good value, and it had its competition beat by approx. 25 $.
B00DJBQ1SW|4|The ramps are nice but still a little short for a 4 wheel drive truck. The reason i gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the straps provided do not work well, and you will probably need to find a better method to attach to your tailgate to prevent them from sliding off. The straps provided are weak and don't lock and unlock very easily. The ramps do seam strong and made loading my toro zero turn lawn mower easy.
B00IKJ6VRY|5|Good value
B000WEPJOG|5|Excellent just like all the other Weather Tech products!
B00P6OIR0U|4|Took me just over an hour to install. Looked at some videos on YouTube on how to install. So far so good and cost me under $28 dollars. Saved myself couple hundred by not going to the dealership.
B007WR25KW|1|Did not fit the car
B0082GKQQW|2|When a product says if will fit your car, one would expect it to fit like the ones in the car.  These do not.  the front ones are not near as wide as the original, and the back ones are not as wide, and you have to cut them to fit. These were bought for protection doing the winter and not being as wide they are not going to keep the carpet that clean.
B000CIXMIC|5|Excellent piece and easier to install the OEM...
B001D1Z85C|5|worked good, fast delivery
B002N5YDG2|5|easy to install but have not used it yet will repost after its been operational
B00T2P1TWC|5|WORKS GREAT
B00BFDIX50|4|please
B00U117THK|5|A little hard to put on but other than that, very happy with the fit, looks and feels.
B002NOH7GG|1|It's chrome tape what a rip off.  Don't buy this junk not a grill.
B005OVIEVW|5|I had no problems attaching and fit perfect.
B000E5S38C|4|I really like K&N.
B009PNEIHY|5|Thanks, they are great.
B00GA71QVE|5|These steps are absolutely amazing.  The quality is phenomenal and extremely solid.  More importantly, they work and fit exactly as they are supposed to.  Everything was immaculately wrapped to ensure nothing was damaged.  I am so pleased by these that my next project is the power retractable running boards from AMP!
B00GFF6LM0|5|perfect replacement, color matches and easy to install
B0006H92RY|5|This is so much better than the drop in pouches.
B00B7FQXH6|5|great products. Thanks
B00MB0E1ZC|5|Perfect for me.  Received this item timely as the seller promise.  I order this one because I love purple and I needed a cover that's not leather because the summer heat makes it hard to stir the wheel.  Very good purchase.  I recommed this purchase as well as from the seller.
B00D38O0IO|4|Nice and bright, fit well, seem to be decent quality.
B00A740VQM|5|This is a good set. I really like it. Makes working on my computers easy. Im not always searching for screwdrivers. They are all in one place.
B00C5SGEQO|5|Very easy to install and does the trick at blocking paths of entry for hornets/wasps and rodents.
B004M0CZS4|5|Exactly what it says. 3&#34; pink fuzzy dice
B002PQW4SI|5|Excellent product.  Excellent price.  Fast delivery.  A+++
B00YI3IGA6|5|Easy to install
B00REZ8XF8|5|Looks better than OEM G37 Sedan visors because they cover the rear 3rd windshield a slight bit. More than half the price of the OEM version with identical looks. My only complaint is that these visors are not very tinted. I had OEM visors on my 08 Acura TL and those visors were dark and equivalent to 20% window tint. I have installed wellvisors on my brothers 09 Camry and my 11 G37 Sedan and both of them are very light. They appear to be maybe 70% tint. I like darker tinted visors because they help block the sun while driving sometimes.
B000CAINEI|1|the felt edges of this product deteriorate in the sun/heat - as a result,  any time I go to remove the product from my windshield, LARGE tufts of fabric go flying around my car.  Its alarming to see so much debris floating around in my car, knowing i'll be sitting in there and breathing it all in during my 45min commute.  Additionally, its annoying and disgusting to see my car covered in this product's waste material.
B00EKMXIFI|5|great lite
B009DJZUEA|3|Fit and finish seem to be good but definitely not of factory toyota quality. It will work for my mesh grill project though. When I received it the lower mounting prong was sticking out of the box and one of the top mounting tabs were broken. I assume this was from shipping. It also took much longer than previously listed on the tracking info.<br /><br />I'd still recommend this to anyone in need of a replacement grill surround though.
B006IV6CAW|3|you get what you pay for
B004XG3PEA|5|Had a different bracket which broke. This one seems to be better made.
B00KY5DJQ8|3|The Good: Sound is excellent! The Bad:The Boom Mic is too flimsy, while riding on the motorcycle the wind pushes it around. The head band needs to be adjustable.
B000GU3C4K|5|Definitely does worth the price!.. Its white and strong, much better than stock 55w bulbs. Also the shipment speed was faster than expected
B002ZBWKAU|4|practical and easy to use
B00KTIUG5C|5|Thanks the shipping was a little slow but it did finally make it on the last day of the estimated delivery window. The remotes are great and work as they should.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|When I first bought my car (2014 Subaru STi), I knew I wanted LED tag lights. I made the mistake of buying those dinky Chinese-made knockoffs which only lasted about a month (maybe even less). Both bulbs simultaneously suffered catastrophic failure and began flashing like disco lights. I'm surprised I wasn't pulled over.<br /><br />I won't make that mistake again. I ordered these Sylvania bulbs and I've been extremely impressed with the quality and performance. They are truly white and not that weird violet/blue color that other, cheaper bulbs have. They are somewhere between cheap &#34;blue&#34; LEDs and halogens. Very nice.<br /><br />They're also considerably brighter and fit the sockets better. I am sure these will last for a long time.
B00IMPEWHM|2|IT broke when I attempted to install.
B007W4ICJS|5|fantastic
B005JU5UEW|5|Performed great. Easy to install. 2011 Hyundai Sonata SE
B004LO0KTW|5|As good as OE. Beautiful chrome.
B00HWHDPAQ|3|Easy to use but did not color-match 100%.
B004P9F7DC|5|Such a good product to add on your FJ. It was a bit challenging  to put on. I do not recommend to assemble by yourself. this is a 3 person job.
B0019HWTMA|5|I bought this to fit a new Walker 82663 Catalytic Converter for my 2000 forester.  I also needed a Walker 31357 Exhaust Gasket for the back end of the catalytic converter.  Since I was installing a new catalytic converter I also replace the front O2 sensor with a Bosch 17018 Oxygen Sensor, and replaced the back O2 sensor with a Bosch 13469 Oxygen Sensor.
B00029JKG4|5|Great and easy installation.
B00KJ184XA|5|Fast shipping and great product!
B01024SHOY|5|Built well, comes with no instructions, took me extra time to install it,  after playing with length adjusting screws to get brackets in place and flat,out of box  chipped paint on two tiny spots, fast shipping from the seller, did it make a difference? Well maybe? I noticed that i slide less to sides on driver seat when taking exits at highways, but don't  expect a stiffer ride or a 50% boost, in my case its a 7% steering boost at most(less over steering maybe) , installing performance sway bars will do much more than this upgrade. It didn't break the bank so im happy with it.
B000TYHZM8|5|works on 96 gm vehicles with rectangle reservoir.
B00EQAY290|5|Very good, thank you
B00KQ9S8LS|5|Just what the Dr. Ordered! great price, great product!
B00TPWZY96|5|Received very quickly! Just what I wanted!
B008S9QUGI|4|Installed fairly easy... works fine.
B00ZJIX9EW|4|Top is nice, strong and sturdy. I only wish it contoured more to an exact fit for my bed. It has proven to protect my gear really well and has kept it dry even though I have been driving and sitting in pouring rain several times. A better fit and it woukd get a 5 star from me. Looks good on my truck.
B0002JN2EU|5|My Stihl trimmer bogged down and would not start. I cleaned the exhaust filter with a torche and still nothing. Watched YouTube videos on how to take out the carborator and clean it along with the lines using seafoam. Put it back together and it took off instantly and started smoking and running like new!! I usually don't post little stuff like this but I was shocked at how good it worked!! A must for my little two stroke engine!! Also as a precaution if you haven't thrown out your old gas and got new fuel for the year I highly suggest doing that as well and using the highest octane. Ethanol is not a friend of the two stroke!
B00GSAUHB8|5|The sun shade fits perfect and works extremely well protecting my car from the strong Colorado sun. I have another of these sun shades for my other vehicle and love them both! The shade is easy to twist and fold and stores nicely.
B00W83C816|5|Fits and adds a unique look to the CX5.
B0002STR90|5|Fast dilvery top notch disc
B00XLXWD4Y|5|Correct color of Orange.<br />Not too flashy, adds just the right touch for a couple of alums.
B007V2C59E|5|Perfect fit!  Works great - good coverage of the windshield. Great insulation - truly makes a great difference.  A little on the expensive side - but if it lasts it will be worth it.
B00BEN3AYA|5|Perfect for my project !!!
B00029J4SS|5|These work so much better than the cheap nylon gaskets.
B004LQRLQA|4|I bought this faucet to replace the old one in my camper. It installed quickly and easily and was as expected, plastic, for our RV. I don't love it, as it really is super cheap feeling, but it does match all of the other faucets in my camper, so I'm happy enough.
B00CWQJ6ZK|5|I received the item as advertised and it was delivered before expected. I am truly satisfied with my purchase.
B00LO0M918|5|Bright white light; love it. Reasonably priced. Hope they last like LED lights should last.
B000C426Y2|5|Fine
B001EOV492|5|Fits great!
B00573N35O|1|Very cheaply made and didn't even really work...waste of $30
B00X4UG88Q|5|WHAT A STUNNING LICENSE PLATE COVER.  IT LOOKS GREAT ON MY BRIGHT CANDY-APPLE RED NEW SRX.  IF YOU LIKE BLING, THIS COVER WILL DRESS UP YOUR CAR AND LOOK STUNNING.  I READ REVIEWS OF OTHERS OFFERED, AND MANY PEOPLE COMMENTED THAT COVERS CAME WITH RHINESTONES MISSING.  THIS ONE WAS PERFECT.  LOVE IT.
B000E5XM1U|5|Nice
B000CGFOAI|4|Worked great on my 2001 Plymouth Neon.
B00VQM1R44|5|Looks great, a real head turner
B00A2YLYYU|5|Looks great.
B0085IL4BS|5|AAA
B0085OK2DI|5|Love my keychain!! Shipping was also very fast! Thank you!!!😊
B001THQP84|5|AAA
B00FQQCVLY|5|Excellent look
B00GXXMG7S|3|Had extra dome lights but no reverse lights
B007Q8ESO8|4|I like the liners! My only complaint is the one on the passenger side slides around.
B00D39LG6M|4|this product is great. It looks good, and it wasn't to hard to assemble on my FJ cruiser. From a scale from 1-10 its difficulty was a 7 just because I had to drill three holes in my car, but that's not a big deal.
B008XNRENW|5|Excellent
B007OXCIB0|5|Easy to install and a great buy for the price.
B00681BDXI|5|they worked perfect thank you.
B000OAZDCQ|5|Size exact. No leaks. What else can I say, it worked
B000CLOBSE|5|Awesome brake shoes, my squeaking brakes are gone!!!!!!!!
B008GVBM70|5|Excellent
B001JQCCFK|5|I bought these for my husband to use in our family car, and I ended up loving them as much as him! I highly recommend these!
B007Y880S0|4|Good product, shipping box was destroyed, but product no damaged
B001F212OK|5|Works as it should. No complaints. Goes to 150psi
B00S41HZDC|5|Excellent light easy to install no Brainer
B0077S0NAU|4|Customer service and delivery 5 stars<br />Product a little flimsy
B007V2E7KY|5|Makes a big difference. Using this product may decrease the heat in my truck by approximately 10-15 degrees. It's easy to install as well.
B000GU5IH4|1|When I got this cover first I was surprised how thin the material was. But it worked fine for a while. After being exposed to a single summer worths of sun the material got so brittle that a good gust of wind just tore this thing to shreds. Total waste of money!
B00009PGNR|5|Works great.  No issues.
B001Y8Y9VI|3|Accidentally cracked one during installation, still looks ok however.
B00YVQD4A2|1|It arrived broken.
B002VVIQ2U|5|Better than bought at an auto parts store.
B0070NNUQG|5|Arrived on time and worked as expected.
B001EOYIKE|5|The receiver was as described and was relatively simple to install. It is very sturdy and well made.
B00KTIUG5C|1|Would give zero stars both units have failed were hardly used pool poor quality.. Don't buy!
B00IW5JXY4|5|Very awesome deal. Thank you very much. I thought that I had to spend a lot of money when my rear rotor on my Thunder mountain chopper broke. Then I found this.  Very good quality for the money ☺
B001D9E41I|5|Fits the door windows well; wish they had more sizes that would fit the bedroom window as I like to sleep in complete darkness, especially when I get to sleep in.
B003EP0SCS|3|The tank and valve is made in China. Hard to find a place to fill the tank. Welding supply shops won't take the tank on exchange. Research your fill options before buying.
B000E8XFOQ|5|AAA+++
B004K9ESN2|5|Very good product, light weight but strong, I uses it for my Jet Ski so far so good.
B000UHA6YI|3|Work good but doesn't look like the picture.
B0024NSR4C|5|Couldn't imagine an easier headlight replacement and at a fantastic price!
B000B8U61O|4|Fit well on older 5th wheel!
B000ETUD22|1|instead of using this tool get a $1 lug nut from the local tire place along with a stack of washers or an old socket. for $2 total you can do the exact same thing as this tool does. better yet find someone with a press and buy them a 6 pack, they'll probably do the work for free.
B000GU5IH4|4|This fits my 1982 Honda 900F just right. It looks real nice and I feel lots better when the 9 is covered up. My only issue is that the black color is discoloring pretty quickly. However, it is the relentless cooking of that good ol Texas sun that is taking its toll on the Nelson-Rigg cover. So, better the cover than my bike.
B008PTV7QY|1|Could  not apply as primer applicator was dried up.  Called company and still have not received a replacement.  Got interrogated by phone person like I didn't know what I was doing, we have all seen dried up glue.  I expected better response and really am disappointed I had to make a call to the company.  I still have not received replacement primer as promised.
B00SXEQ86U|4|Very easy to get off and on. I need to keep our little car coveted between uses. I can do it without help.
B003O95MT8|5|Literally took 5 min to install.  Works perfect.
B00AA2EW66|2|Just what I expected.The color matches the trim in my car almost exactly! The quality seems good so far.
B0019ID63U|1|Didn't work.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Best scanner for the price. Works perfect.
B00SNV9OFA|3|I had to remake the brackets to make them fun in my truck. After a few months the sides begin to break down. Try and not sit on the sides to much getting in and out. They don't come with directions to put them together. The cloth is thin it can rip easily.  But I like the way they feel and they lay all the way back and you don't slide.
B00R1LP17S|5|This is without a doubt the best portable 12v compressor I have come across; it will do the job. I also think it is well  built and will last through frequent usage. ...an excellent buy!
B00N59JGOO|5|Looks great covering some scratches on my new Jetski.
B004M0D04C|5|The dice are props for car shows which we attend about once a month.
B00O83OQJQ|5|Not only was this very easy to install on my truck it looks awesome!!  The brake light is bright but the best part is that the can lights light up the whole bed unlike the factory one. I had even put super bright leds in it and it wasn't as bright as this one!!! Awesome product
B00RB66KU0|1|very small not like they said and i got charged for 4 sets
B002MQAWOY|5|Excellent Product, just as advertise
B00GBVHPNW|4|Awesome gloves for the price. Only reason not giving 5 stars is it rips near wrist from taking on and off but its still great for price
B00G4L23PY|5|Really like these bulbs. They were better than the Phillips that I had before.
B001C4OB26|5|Fit my 2007 Z4 3.0i perfectly.<br /><br />Very nice quality.
B00B76RXRY|5|easy to install,fit well and look good.
B002UC4Q92|1|Product Description says two latches, but only 1 arrived! Returned once and now same again.<br /><br />False advertising: &#34;They are made of durable steel and are either zinc plated or powder coated in a while finish. 2 per package.&#34;
B00DSD6AFA|5|Great little sticker. I got the smallest one for the back of my iPhone 5s and it fits and looks great. The design hasn't become worn or scratched off at all like other stickers I've had. It was very sticky and it doesn't seem like it is going to come off anytime soon.
B00U1PI6Y6|5|Switch was the perfect fit for my 2000 Ford Ranger passenger side window power window switch.  Pep Boys also include a small sample bottle of Tire Wet.  You wouldn't know it isn't an original OEM or Motorcraft part.
B00WBE3ZDW|5|Very good product, it is light but really strong when attached to the car trunk. I tested it today with some stuffs in a plastic bag and they stayed together all the time. It's a little bit difficult to remove when is on the carpet of the car trunk.
B00IJYFN24|5|Looks great and fits like it should!!
B008NA49II|5|Awesome love them
B000R5IASC|5|Works good so far.  I like that it has pressure relieve valve so you can check and monitor fuel flow too to see if it has air or anything in it.
B0009I5WK6|5|Fit my 2002 Toyota Tacoma Pre-Runner
B00WZA1A1Q|5|Levers fit no problem. Work great
