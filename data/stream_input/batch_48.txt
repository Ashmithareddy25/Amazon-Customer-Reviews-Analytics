B00DUGCLY4|3|,good for the mind and making you think.  Silly pictures to guess.<br /> Fun,but not always makes sense. But most are easy after you think about it.
B002U0KHMY|5|Matt Bomer gives the best performance. He brings the charater of the con man turned FBI CI to life with style, charm, humor. Add the relationship with FBI agent Peter Burke played greatly by Tim Dekay and the show really comes to life. This show makes me take a new look a White Collar crime.   This is a great show for FBI show fans, drama, comedy and of course it doesn't hurt to look at Matt Bomer.
B0076JPX46|5|This is one of the greatest trilogys I have ever read.  For me, \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\" started of a little confusing, but once I got into it, I just couldn't put the book down and couldn't wait to get to volume 2. Now finishing volume 3 (Hornet's Nest), I am disappointed that there are no more volumes.  I just love it!!!
B005IZLPMY|5|Love this movie, and I got a great deal on the two disc option over Cyber Monday, the quality is great in the Blu-ray
B00BAXFECK|2|I realize this book won a Pulitzer Prize book I found it disappointing.  I felt that the  writing was verbose to excess.  The author often goes on for several pages describing how the main character is feeling.  I had trouble figuring out where the story was going or more importantly the point of the story.  Overall a depressing book that I really had to force myself to finish.
B00F35B8F8|5|loved it
0452270073|5|Many of the other reviewers have discussed this book's plot and its themes, as well as its remarkably good writing and its painstaking historical research. There's something else about this book that is also extraordinary: its sheer intelligence. Pat Barker introduces the reader not just to the mind of a remarkable psychiatrist, but also to  those of various soldiers suffering from various degrees of shell shock from World War I, as well as a woman who is dating one of these soldiers. In each case, the portrayal is so real, so human, so deep, and so lifelike that the book almost reads like non-fiction -- not just because Barker's understanding of the human mind is so profound, but because equally profound is her ability to use words to convey that understanding. This is a book that should be mandatory reading for anyone interested in the effects of war on the psyche, in the inner workings of the mind, in the early history of psychiatry, and most of all, for anyone who wants to spend many hours inside a world carved of thoughtfulness.
B00992CF6W|4|I love Minecraft. And having it on my new kindle is even better! But the game always lags for me, my brother, or my sister and we can't play like that without dying from mobs or suffocation. Because of that I give it 4 stars
B00EYNGP8A|1|This is a poor imitation of dear Agatha--read to the end but found it boring and lacking her crisp descriptions.
B00821OX98|5|Because it's a good series and isnt about crime dramas.theres not enough shows on like this.everyother one is crime.you already know the out come.
0679436391|5|This is Dickens at his best.  But your add said this was for ages 4-8.  As this does not appear to be an abridged addition, 4-8 years old is way too young.  I will be reading it to my 8 year old, explaining the olde English phrases as we go.  Best to say this is the original text and leave it at that.
B00992CF6W|5|So cool five stars you have nothing then you make a house then fight and mine AWESOME
B00QW8TYWO|5|Fun game I had a fun time and this game was awesome hope you have a fun time to as
B00I8H78J8|5|It's hard for me once I'm committed to a movie to really think of the negatives, to be fair. What's more I don't usually like time travel movies. I will say that having had a recent illness has made me more than a bit aware of mortality issues and it's important to say that they are here to be dealt with.<br />Without spoiling things for most people, I'd say that here is an English movie (yes Rachel McAdams is not) without fear of emotional content and portrayal. In a time where we see many movies limited to a young set or an older one, this is definitely not the case. Life is fluid, and experiences are there to be shared among the characters and with the audience of any age, or at least most ages. It isn't a &#34;teacher of lessons&#34; in the sense that it isn't moralistic, but it does leave a viewer potentially thinking, and yes I confess learning a thing or two. As important, for me, were the feelings that stayed with me afterwards, that inspired me to reflect on my own life and relationships.<br />The acting is uniformly wonderful, with Bill Nighy being absolutely wonderful.<br />One thing I'd add but it's probably obvious, this is not the flick for people who only like cerebral…and for people like me, tissues should at least be nearby.
B00JE5NR4I|5|My son and I were prepared for this to be a medium, but watchable, stinker because of some of the reviews, but ended up loving the movie.  Great fantasy, action movie with a love interest.  Really enjoyed it.
B00005MP58|5|This is the best movie! Great acting, follows novel well and it so funny!
B00AYJCEYC|5|Okay yes, my review may be a bit jaded since I'm a Michael fan ... however, he does an excellent job of interpreting the songs.  I grew up listening to these songs and Michael has nailed them.  Delicious tonal inflections.  He doesn't duplicate the songs, he understands them.  Great listen.  The RIP promotion is a nice added benefit too!
B00J11U4J6|5|I also pre-ordered this exact same mega combo pack on Mar 21 for $29.99, and a week later on Mar 29 got the E-mail that it had been cancelled and replaced with a new item at $45.00.  This new movie combo pack is exactly the same as the previous, but for the 50% price increase only added a minifig and photo.  Like others, I was rather upset and contacted Amazon customer service who was very nice.  They had me place the new order ($41.99 by the time I placed the order) and then gave me a $12.00 credit.  So when the movie finally ships, it will only charge me $29.99 as I originally ordered.  Great customer service.<br /><br />On the movie itself, it is far more than just an entertaining kids movie with jokes adults get too.  It's actually a very good story, with a twist that is very well done that makes it an exceptionally crafted film.  Can't wait to have it in my home theater and watch it several times.<br /><br />April 2nd, 2014 EDIT: Apparently because of our discussion and work here, Amazon sent out a message today that they are offering a $10 Promotional Certificate for those of us that pre-ordered the first pack and were canceled, to compensate for the product price increase.  One of the comments to this review says they were able to cancel their 2nd order where Amazon had already given a $12 credit, and apply both the $12 credit and $10 promo towards a new 3rd order.  I don't know how to do that without losing the $12 credit, though.
B001GM28HO|5|Love this record, love Lady Ga Ga. Poker Face has become THE song for the summer and I have to have it on the cd player whenever I get in the car. If you like really good music with an electronic undertone, you will love this one!! Another good record;[[ASIN:B001GO09MI Circus]].
B005ZOBNOI|5|A stellar look into the meaning of life, pain, and loss that goes beyond platitudes and isn't afraid not to try to provide all the answers. DO NOT begin reading this book if you have anything important coming up in your life, because it's beautifully written characters and story will consume your soul until you finish the book.<br /><br />Also, you will need tissues. Lots of tissues.
B000BB1MI2|4|charlie and the choco factrory was fantastic. i loved the writing and casting. it was a twisted version of the wonka we all loved. <br /> <br />the umbas threw me off, them being computer shrunkin and all but besides that, Johnny Depp did an awesome job in showing humor and got everything right in playing his character's role. <br /> <br />typed by her daughter colette&lt;------------ x] <br /> <br />
B000088E6D|5|Great. Quick delivery
B006LSZECO|5|Well-thought out plot, hard to put down.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0007GAERG|5|Mariah went back to basics with this record. Bringing the old classic Mariah that made her a vocal force in the 90s, mixing it with her songwriting abilities, and a great vibe of grooves from a few great producers...she managed to pull it off and came up with this brilliant album! With retro-style R&B/Soul flavor to dance-club hip hop grooves while making the main focal point, which is THE VOICE ~ it's one of the best albums she's ever recorded alongisde 1997's 'Butterfly' album.<br /><br />This record is highly recommended.
B004ZN9W5M|5|Pink Floyd - always the best!
B00QXKB7X0|5|Fantastic, love ID
0345440900|5|I agree with some of the reviews I have read. But as a mother of 2 totally different 'typed children' you need to have more than just one 'specialist' up your sleeve. You can't possibly agree with every author or specialist out there! I found with my first son that the Babywhisperer was a wonderful book to reference. He was however, a very easy baby, and went along with what ever we did. My second son however, I thank God I had Tracy's books. He is a touchy baby by nature and was very hard to read and understand. Everyone told me he had colic. I am not one for labeling a problem just so I can ignore it. I re-read this book searching for answers, and there it was 'touchy'. He just needed to have less stimulation than other babies. He needed me to pay more attention to his sleep signals. I am very attatched to both of my boys and feel that as a parent you cannot label your parenting style. Read lots of books and tailor yours and your childs needs individually. This book is one I highly recomend having handy for every parent. And in Tracy's memory I give these books out to expecting moms I know.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Excellent read!  If you liked the first book, this one won't disappoint.
B0090P98Z4|5|This game is very cool and it has many different items you can buy and it has multiplayer mode and it is filled with action and excitement. This is the ultimate game.
B00ENTDDGW|2|have to be  on  wifi to play  so I had to  uninstalled it  did  not  know  that  when  got  it
B00CS74W0C|1|Books 1 thru 3 of five in series. Book 4 is being released next week two years after Book 3. Though the story is interesting it is not good enough to wait another two years to finish. I refuse to continue with these serials. Fifty percent of the books are a rehash if the previous books with too little new material. I returned the box set for a refund.
B000E1YVZU|5|NO DAY BUT TODAY!!!! SO CLEAR AND GOT TO ME VERY QUICKLY!! I've watched it 3 times already!
B001NLKXK2|1|Great and insightful story/
0790730960|5|Although this DVD comes with the least amount of extra goodies (it doesn't  even have it's trailer!), it is still the DVD I cherish the most out of my  collection. On top of that, it is likely my favorite movie of all time.  Sure, LOLITA, FIGHT CLUB, LOST HIGHWAY and DEAD MAN are epic films in my  mind and heart, but BATMAN RETURNS is the only movie I can simply never get  sick of. <br />Always I have felt attachted to the characters of Gotham, and  never have I seen it portrayed better then in this film. I like the first  BATMAN movie, but thought it was slowed by the borish Kim Basinger, the  awful Prince songs which really didn't fit, the brass and gold hues which  were so predominate throughout the film, and the presence of the Joker  which was so everpresent. I absolutely love Jack as the classic cackling  clown but he controls the movie so exceedingly that it might as well have  been called JOKER rather then BATMAN. The first BATMAN film is great but,  nevertheless, BATMAN RETURNS was the first DVD I went out and bought.  <br />One of the things that does make the DVD so worth owning as well is that  this is exactly the type of movie that DVD's are for. Gorgeous films which  can only be fully grasped by widescreen. This film seems to leap out of  your television as you watch it, and the clarity and quality of the DVD is  earnestly captivating.<br />Keaton is the only Batman, despite his lack of  bulk. Devito is pure genius as the waddling mutant. Pfeiffer is brillant in  the sultry, dramatic, legendary role of a lifetime. But Walken is  overlooked. People often forget he was even in this movie, but he has some  of the greatest lines and is, in every right, a very classicly Batmanian  villian.<br />The irrational romance between the torn souls of Batman and  Catwoman (and their other egos) drives this movie for me, even more then  the fantastic skeletons on motorcycles, the Arctic World domain, and all  the other bedazzling aspects of the film.<br /> Simply getthis!<br />Many people  I know who saw it once in the theater were blown away when I played it for  them again on DVD. The sheer cinematic garbage that was BATMAN FOREVER and  the abomination of BATMAN AND ROBIN seem to have brainwashed people into  thinking all Batman films are lousy, commercial flops of idiocy. But once  someone sits down to watch BATMAN RETURNS, they are reawakened to the power  of the bat, and of the magesty of Burton's gift.<br />I CANNOT RECOMMEND  ANYTHING MORE HIGHLY!!!!!!!!!
B00FAI2IUM|1|Can not find any help or rules for this game.. Would be more fun with some explanation on how to use the options available
B00IS87HYI|3|I have been stuck on one level since Apirl/ May, it is very frustrating.  I can rescue the pets but cannot reach the point goal by a lot of points.  It was one of my favorites, now I am just too frustrated to play.  Several of my friends have been stuck there as well- level 172.
B00CUG8GAS|5|A wonderful, riveting account of growing up in the collapsing colonial world.  Fuller's writing is vivid, descriptive, and riveting.  The book gives a very real face to the historical process of decolonization.  It's also just a really great memoir.
B006KAWFXE|4|Got this for my daughter as a collection piece. Good deal, but not sealed as stated.
0679805273|5|This was a gift for my daughter's graduation.  We left a personal note on the inside.
B000FAMT72|5|Item was received promptly and in great condition. Vinyl will always be the best way to \\"listen\\" to music. The Beatles on vinyl...PERFECTION.
B004S9AK3G|5|Ken Follett has a fantastic gift for story telling.  I have found all his books that I have read captivating and difficult to put down once started.  I am a great fan unfortunately he can't write as fast as we can read.So I anxiously await his next release
B002WY65VU|4|Woody Harrelson is flat-out hilarious as a man who shoots a ton of zombies while jonesing for Twinkies.  Abigail Breslin holds her own as a preteen shooter of the aforementioned zombies, while Jesse E. could be a ringer for Michael Cera and Emma Stone could be another Kat Dennings.      This is the U.S. of Zombieland, where even the rich and famous cannot escape the infection which has afflicted much of the population.  Somehow, the filmmakers manage to blend the gore with a lot of humor as several people come together in an impromptu family group on the road together, dealing with trust issues and constant zombie attacks--when they're not looking for those little yellow sweet delights.    Fun stuff!
B006LSZECO|5|Riveting...cannot put it down.  I am in awe of such a talented author!
B00FJ2YTLK|5|I literally couldn't put this book down and now I'm so sad that this series is done!
B0051QO4QY|5|This album is the best thing that has came out in my lifetime.  The length is perfect and each song is a masterpiece!  Also, the album artwork is to die for!
B00M7URUUE|5|Loved it
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great game
B000FC2L1E|5|I love this series by Dana Gabaldon.  The writing is so unique and so very descriptive that you almost feel like you are a fly sitting on the main character's shoulder, seeing the surroundings and taking it all in just as she does.  The interesting characters, the nonstop action and the changing scenery all make these books spectacular reading.  You are amazing, Ms. Gabaldon  -  I thank you for such wonderful reading entertainment.
B00MFDPI0M|1|Awful.  I haven't read the books so i have nothing to compare it to but it was a waste of money to rent. So predictable and cheesy.  We kept watching to see if it would get better.  All we did was waste more of our lives.
B008DR258W|4|They are all fantastic to watch. I download them to my Kindle Fire and watch them at work, during break time and lunch.  I'm addicted :) Just kidding they are really good.
B00008MNYS|4|Robbie Williams is full of himself. You know it. I know it. And obviously, Williams knows it, too. After all, this is a guy who blurts out in \\"Handsome Man,\\" \\"It's not very complicated/I'm just young and overrated.\\" But whatever your take on Robbie is, there's no denying his animated personality. His breezy new album, \\"Escapology,\\" is a huge improvement over his last studio disc of original songs, 2000's \\"Sing When You're Winning.\\" Reuniting with (and then firing) his longtime songwriting buddy Guy Chambers, Robbie's new album has the songwriting craft of Elton John and the Beatles, coupled with the stage presence of a twentysomething Freddie Mercury. The American version has a different tracklisting than the UK version (for one, there's no \\"Cursed,\\" a bitter kiss off to alleged paramour Geri Halliwell), but it works just as well. \\"Feel\\" is worthy of the US Top Ten status it achieved across the Atlantic, while \\"Me and My Monkey,\\" a seven minute track replete with Spanish horns, stands out pretty well. And, there's the tribute to his grandmother, titled \\"Nan's Song.\\" This is a disc of fine pop you can listen to without ever hitting the \\"skip\\" button. But will \\"Escapology\\" make him a star in a country already in love with the Justin Timberlakes, 50 Cents, and Avril Lavignes dominating our airwaves? It's tough to say. America is no easy market to penetrate, but if we sleep on a disc as fine as this, the loss will certainly be ours.
0740748475|5|One of my greatest regrets was when Calvin & Hobbes were stopped.    No I can enjoy them at my liesure.
B000FC1HBY|5|I am ready to get book 3 since I just finished this one! Lots of great characters, plots, and twists! I am so glad I was turned on to these books...great read! I will finish all of them..got to know how all of this ends! I have told everybody I know to read this series...it is must!
B00FAX6XQC|5|I was bored, and downloaded this game. I enjoy it to an extent, and will continue to play it.
B00IEBE7GK|5|I don't usually do a review - call me lazy.  This is a great game, let alone the low price for the quality.  Get this game and its predecessor.  You won't be disappointed!
B00881VLCE|4|Very enjoyable on my Kindle Fire. Very good assortment of puzzle images. Only thing I wish it had that seems to be missing is a zoom feature for the puzzle previews which I feel are a bit too small. Work around is my pocket magnifier.
B000EYK4GW|4|Nothing wrong with the DVD at all but I find the animated movie itself is for a very young child and even in that case can't seem to hold their attention all the way through the movie.  Still there are some beautiful songs and it's a great animated film.
B000J025AE|5|Very satisfied with the DVD
B009UX2YAC|5|Love it
B00QQW1ZIW|1|I have not seen a movie this bad in a very very long time. Might be the worst movie I have seen period.
B0018XSU3W|5|Good book great condition
B00785P2QC|5|This game is really fun but it can get really hard at times here is a tip save you money and don't spend all your super tickets I made that mistake myself well anyway this game is totally worth getting
B000FC1MM8|5|In the midst of my readings of the adventures of Harry Bosch, I found that I must have missed The Last Coyote. Very hard to believe. However, I was certainly pleased to see the book on Kindle.<br />Finished it just a short time ago and see that Bosch is still great enough to work a case with thoroughness and ease..very impressive, as were all of his adventures that I had the good fortune to read!<br /><br />Well written and detailed enough to please any \\"wannabe\\" detective. Thanks!
B00FATEJYE|5|This game is awesome!! It's really fun I recommend it to you and others! Wonder woman is goog Rigien Doomsday is good Queen Harley is also really good........THANK YOU Beginner pack =D lol
0446608955|1|I read this book. When I first picked it up, I honestly thought that I had mistakenly purchased a copy for those readers who are visually impaired! The type was so large and the margins on the page were huge! As I contined to read, I realized why: Nicholas Sparks has nothing to say. He is riding the wave of the Bridges of Madison County, &quot;romance lite&quot; books -- those kind of small, shallow books that is taking advantage of American readership these days. He knows our attention spans aren't what they used to be, that we're not really that bright and certainly don't like to be challenged intellectually, so he is laughing at us all the way to his bank while publishing this vapid fiction that passes off for books. This was the most revolting, insulting book I have ever read, and actually made me ashamed that I invested the time and money to read it. We can do better than this, American readers!
B00BTYP6QE|5|I like this game very much but i reached a point that i have to spend $3.99 to continue playing. That is a bummer in a game that was suppose to be free!!!
B000FA5STS|5|Lots of turns and deceptions. Enjoyed the book. Did not put it down.
B000OCXMAE|1|Well I read the SPIN interview with Chester about the new CD, and he said he wanted to let people know that the band was capable of \\"more than what was shown in Meteora and Hybrid theory.\\"  He said the same thing at my local radio station where they previewed six tracks.  This of course worried me, I, even as an artist, don't understand the driving need to change somethign that works. <br /> <br />Growing is fine, becoming more experienced and trying new things is fine, but why completely change because you want to show something to people?  Especially, in this sense, when your first two albums were amazing and original in themselves?  The new album is, without a doubt, \\"emo.\\"  Linkin Park was always a bit emo to begin with, some of the lyrics screamed \\"emo\\" but I just chose to ignore it, \\"They still rock.\\"  However, replacing the amazing guitar riffs, Mike Shinoda hiding nearly the entire album, and replacing the hard-hitting drums with simple.  The least unbearable songs on the album are \\"Given Up\\" \\"Bleed It Out\\" \\"No More Sorrow\\" and \\"Hands Held High.\\"  Two of which are basically slightly heavy which makes me remember how Linkin Park once was, and the other two where Mike Shinoda actually raps, one of which soudns more like Fort Minor than Linkin Park. <br /> <br />LP went in the wrong direction here, they'll probably loes a huge portion of their fanbase and perhaps gain a whole new one, I don't know.  I'm certain I can speak for many fans when I say, \\"What the hell, Linkin Park?\\" <br /> <br />Here's to hoping the next CD won't suck.
B009LH1Y1W|5|Especially since S Gr8t has led to an early renewal for S9!  :)  Supernatural is the best show on television.  J2 are the best actors in TV right now.  My only plea:  BRING BACK BOBBY SINGER!!!!!!
B00P77ZAN8|5|this a great game that involves strategy and decision making.
B00LP1MVSW|5|Can't stop playing this game!!!!
B004KPQK2S|5|Wonderful movie about love and courage of a horse and its owner.
0756407915|3|It's great. It's exciting, mostly. It's interesting. But by the end of the book... nothing significant has happened. Nothing's really changed. Maybe two or three significant plot points happen, but by the end of the 900+ pages, I wonder if they even mattered. It's a good read, but at times it felt plodding and dragging and I had to force my way through the middle section. And at the end, I felt the author/narrator (I can't really tell them apart) was just kind of an arrogant jerk who thinks too highly of himself. Ah well. If you want more Kvothe, here it is. You'll just be treading water with it, and ultimately waiting for the next (and final) installment.
B00BHMETKC|5|love &#34;based on true story&#34; movies, makes me hunt for the real story.  Excellent actors, VERY good movie.  Would recommend this movie in a heartbeat
B00PTB7B34|5|Greeeeeeeeat game
B009C7ZQM4|5|Good cleaner for my samsung tablet.  Cleans up a lot of junk, is easy to use and it lets you know when you need to do a 'clean-up' - has other things you can do with it also.  Good app and research says it is one of the better cleaning apps out there.
B007TBZ63Y|5|awesome book! even though, i like, reread the story ALOT of times - the story is still exciting and fun! although, there is one thing about the book i DO NOT like. only the greek characters get to narate the story- only anabeth,leo, piper,and percy get to narrate.but still, it's a great book.i would advise people who are looking for great reads to read the series especially The Mark of Athena
B008XG1X18|5|I love this but I hate that you have to go through two pages to repin.  oh and this is so much better than facebook !! &lt;3
B0000894RZ|5|Love it  love it  love it
B00C32R64G|4|Not their best album, but a good, solid album from Volbeat. If you like their other albums, you'll enjoy this one.
B00FRVH3V6|5|It was an amazing book and had a lot of new greek/roman mythology in it.<br /><br />If you liked the Percy Jackson series definitely read this series because it is the continued series.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Great deal. It was way cheaper than buying an ebook in iBooks. Very pleased with this purchase. This book is a 5 star rating as we'll.
B00C7KXUOE|4|Good
B00004XONN|5|I can't review this CD based on previous Radiohead albums, since this is the first Radiohead CD I've purchased, though I plan to look into more of their stuff in the future. Until a few months ago I hadn't heard anything of Radiohead besides &quot;Creep&quot; on the radio, which didn't impress me so I figured all the talk about Radiohead was just hype. But when I heard the controversy about Kid A, and found out that one of my friends had it, I had to see for myself. Even though most people here say that they hated it the first time, I actually liked it (even though I didn't get some of the songs), and it got better with each listen. <br />   The strength of this album -- and the reason so many people hate it -- is that it is almost completely electronic, with Thom Yorke's voice just fading in and out, sometimes hardly understandable. I think of it as classical music for the electronic music age; the moods and ideas are built with the sound more than anything else. It's kind of like I always thought &quot;space-age&quot; music would sound when I was a kid, and that futuristic mood works with the theme of Kid A. <br />   Another thing is that even though someone (maybe Thom himself) described Kid A as &quot;emotionless,&quot; I thought it was extremely emotional, such as the melancholy &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; and the confusion of &quot;Idioteque.&quot; Beside all its artistic merit, it's good listening for when you're depressed.
B009UX2YAC|5|I would recommend this app to anyone! It's fun and entertaining and it can shut up anyone! I chose 5 star because it's the best game I have ever played! I have never played anything like it b4!
B00DJFIMW6|5|I luv luv luuuv,this game I would TOOTS (totally) play it everyday!I would really recommend it for my daughter. (FYI  I am writing in a language that kids these days know how to read).P.S I AM A GROWN CHILD I AM OLD (getting there),SO ENJOY YOUR YOUTH WHILE YOU CAN!
B008CP93S0|1|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Did I watch it to the end?  Well yes, I like my endings, but I fast fowarded it through about 20 minutes.  It's not that it was too vulgar or that I am a prude.  It is just a really bad movie.  I like the actors, just not this movie.
B0085KGHI6|4|This dvd is must for music fans. One of those shows where it would be great to say \\"i was there\\", but alas those us who weren't can still enjoy it. A good picture and sound sure do bring it to life. Would've given this 5 stars but those expecting the whole thing to be all the stones & muddy might be dissapointed a bit. Should've been called \\"muddy & friends\\" there's a heap of good buesmen on this,you will still love it.
0670025593|4|I enjoyed reading this novel.
B0000931OG|4|I'd never really minded Blur, maybe because I'm an Oasis fan. But I downloaded some songs out of Think Tank after it won an award for best album over in the UK. I had to immediately buy the album. It is a clever, slow paced, loving signature of Damon Albarn's thoughts on commerciality and stupidity of the U.S.A . Albarn's melodies reflect on war in not a very profound level, easy political views for the non political. <br />It's a good thing Gallagher's wishes were not fulfilled and Albarn has not died out of Aids, he and Blur have offered a superb album with sounds that from the Moroccan Republic to the night life of a broken city filled with lights, sights and sounds and war.
0880796863|5|The colors are more subdued and earthy than the &#34;regular&#34; RWS deck.  I prefer it as I hardly ever pick up the regular deck as I dislike the &#34;neon&#34; like colors within them.  It's probably just me.  Others dislike this deck very much.  In the end, it's all about personal taste and persprective.  Enjoy.

B000FC10MU|5|The first three times I read Neil Gaiman's \\"American Gods,\\" I kept thinking how much it didn't read like his kind of work (I was used to his happier, wittier, fairy tale type books).  This fourth time through, after having read more of his other works and more of the afterwords he's put them, I realized that it really does read like him:  his milieu is \\"fairy tales\\" AND myth.  This book falls smack in the middle of myth.  Also, a lot of his work is dark, and this book is dark.  There does seem to be a slight difference in tone, though.  \\"American Gods\\" lacks almost all of the witticisms present in his other works and, somehow, it feels more \\"real\\" (probably because he invented only the characters and seems to have tried to keep the settings true(ish) to life). It's a very well-written, well-characterized, well-described dark book.  I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
B00DPM7TIG|3|Ok but not Gone Girl
B00UCI9NSU|4|Excellent
B00DZ83IPS|2|Boring
B004LROUNG|3|Enough character development to keep it interesting. Typical Grisham of lowly lawyers in over their heads. Somewhat predictable ending. Story moves along well.
B000005PW0|5|Some really stupid but hilarous moments from a great movie from the mid-eighties with all kinds of send-ups, modest crudity, fights, traffic chaos and mad officers. Pity about the sequels though, all the same idea over and over again which took the gloss off this classic.
B000FC1HBY|5|Eventually I will give in and buy the entire series.  Men and women alike will be drawn in by Martin's excellent writing and enthralling tales/
B00BHHIWQO|3|I find the game - just okay and that really sums it up. If each game lasted longer than one minute it would make the game more interesting.
B005544TRQ|4|Good show keeps you asking for more.. Will keep watching till I get all caught up to current season.  Fun

B000002MUW|5|THIS IS A GREAT MADONNA CD MY FAVES ARE SURVIVAL,HUMAN NATURE,DON'T STOP,BEDTIME STORIES,AND TAKE A BOW.THIS IS A GREAT ADDITION TO YOUR MADONNA COLLECTION BUY IT NOW!
B001XUPGLY|4|I am, and always will be, your fan.  If it has a Star Trek title I will watch it over and over.  Not my favorite movie in the series, that of course is Wrath of Khan and the latest version. But I sat and watched this and had a couple of cups of coffee and was transported back to when me and William Shatner were both younger and more fit.
B000075BFK|5|This whole 2 disc set is hot, every track is fire, he's still alive, here.
B00L9B7IKE|3|I got sucked into reading this book the same way as someone would stop to look at a car accident.  I didn't want to do it, but I kept reading until I finished the entire book in one day!  I enjoyed reading the different perspectives written by each of the characters but the main character, Rachel, was extremely annoying and I disliked her immensely because of her alcoholism and the ridiculous decisions she makes throughout the book. This book reminded me of Gone Girl, which I did like until the terrible way that the author ended the book.  All, in all, it was a page turner but I wouldn't really recommend it.
B00KA87GCW|5|This games is very interesting and fun so I recommend this app
0425098478|5|The book came highly recommended and I was not disappointed. Not too many pages yet was highly informative. Worth every penny.

B0094LZY2A|4|This is an entertaining, imaginative movie that is suitable for all ages.
B0053O89JM|5|I have bought my son every season of this series and I am sad to see it go. I looked for it at many places and your site had the best price and delivered it very quickly. It was also packaged very well so it didn't get damaged.

B00MFDOY8O|3|was okay, will probably wait for the next one to come out on Netflix
B0063GORYU|2|It has too many advertisements!  You have to stop and get out of the advertisements every time you start a new round.
B002P4VUMQ|5|I admit I have come to the Jason Mraz party so late in his career, as I am sure others were first introduced to him after Lucky and I'm Yours. But now, I can converse with the best on Jason Mraz as I have been looking for and finding a wealth of variations of many tracks on Youtube.  This collection of a Chicago concert contains many standout moments, but this version of Beautiful Mess is by far better than the album version and other live versions (the 2008 Nobel Peace Concert version is a different, but a close 2nd in my opinion).  The first time I listened to this version of Beautiful Mess was while I was driving and I had to pull over and hit replay the version was so moving.  If anyone knows of a site that catalogs all the different versions of his songs and rates them, I'd like to hear from you!

B005UA0FLE|5|This album gets constant replay in my home during the holiday time. I have converted a few of my family members into a Michael fan, because of this album.<br /><br />Everything about this album is perfect from production, to song choices, and most importantly Michael's voice.<br /><br />He is such a talented artist.<br /><br />I can't say much about his most recent album [[ASIN:B00BIVN82M To Be Loved]]... but nonetheless, I have this album and others to fall back on and fall in love with Michael's voice and music all over again.

1401207529|5|This is my favorite batman comic. Frank Miller's writing is poetic and noire, mixed with great artwork = total immersion into Gotham City and the dawn of one of the greatest super heroes ever created. If you are a fan of graphic novels/batman/good writing this is a must read.
B000056MOD|3|better than Highlander3, way better. this one has Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert, both McClouds, teaming up to stop the evil Brucy Payne(the preist Jacob) and it tells of great storys with nice action scenes including scenes with Donnie Yen(from Blade2 and Iron Monkey). theres like one scene with sex and thats with Adrian Paul and his wife. though I hated seeing Lambert's head get chopped off but hey, thats the way it is and the ending where Paul thinks his wife is dead but shes not and she appears is a great ending.
B001QD5OSS|3|Would watch again good movie.
B006LSZECO|3|It was slow going the first few chapters. I was not able to connect or warm up to the various main characters. It got my attention half way through the storyline. The surprising unexpected ending was true to the main storyline though.
B0068860WK|5|Brilliant and on point.Soldiers will understand and pick up on all of the little things, but all will be able to see and appreciate a great epic.
B00006NSGX|3|One More Car is a snapshot of Clapton reinventing himself yet again. There's enough of the blues material that dominated his early career and mainstream rock stuff from his top 40 days to please both old and new fans.<br />Like Paul McCartney's Back In The USA (another excellent live album--in fact the best live album Macca's ever made bar none), Clapton's live albums usually act as a summation to date of his career. He reinvents the stronger material from Pilgrim (and album that had potential but was ruined by trite lyrics and overproduction) and even reaches into his back pocket to whip out the classic Derek and the Dominos track Bell Bottom Blues (always a fav of mine). He even picks a couple of nice tracks from Reptile and breathes new life into them.<br />There are a few drawbacks for long time fans. Eric has chosen to include a number of songs already well represented by his previous live albums. Yes, the're classics but his extensive back catalog would allow him to revive a number of great songs (Tell the Truth, Mainline Florida to name two)that haven't had as much exposure over the years. EC should take a look at McCartney's new tour. He manages to pull out a number of old crowd pleasers (Coming Up, Band on the Run, Jet, Live and Let Die)and manages to include a number of material he's never recorded for a live album before. Many of the classic Beatles numbers (and solo hits) are reinvented by the crack backing band Paul assembled. Additionally, he's played with the arrangements on some just enough to make them seem brand spanking new again.<br />This isn't Slowhand's best live album but he's in fine form throughout. He doesn't have anything to prove and that's to his advantage. As EC ages there's an almost introspective quality that was missing on many of his earlier live albums. That gives this album a freshness that makes it a keeper for long time EC fans.
B0050CJNJ2|5|Lady A nailed it with their third CD. It has been unbelievable to listen to their sound evolve over the past several years. Friday Night is my personal favorite and is such a great love song for both new and old romances. There is no song on this CD that you will want to skip, and you will listen to it repeatedly because all of the songs hit home. If you are looking for a country CD with a modern twist...look no further. Purchase Own The Night.

B00005QW5X|5|There are people on here that do not think that Hedwig is very good, and that is okay.  The next time somebody mentions that they do not think the \\"story is good!!1!!\\" or that \\"all of these transies are weird, omgggg!!!!1\\", I might vomit.<br />If you think that the metaphors John Cameron Mitchell employs are silly or trite- news flash, he didn't make them up.  If you want to disagree with Plato, however, be my guest (it'll just validate your stupidity).  Since Hedwig and the Angry Inch was based upon The Speech of Aristophranes from Plato's Symposium (a foundational text which deals with greek mythology and is really just another version of Genesis which includes room for people of all sexual orientation) you might want to think twice about what you call silly.<br />People know Plato's name for a reason.  Mitchell is a genius.<br />Bravo.

B000000WJZ|5|I just can't say enough about this album! If you are a fan of good music, you absolutely must have it. Siamese Dream is a diverse album with songs ranging from angry to sweet and melodic or a combination of both. Amazing  songwriting here, as well as great drumming and guitar playing. Simply put,  it's indescribable...just buy it and hear for yourself! You won't regret  it...
B00079018K|5|My CD collection is 800+ and growing.  I wanted to add this CD to my collection, but the draconian copy-protection system prevents me, on priciple, from its purchase.  I agree with the sentiment expressed by others, that we must take a stand -- the only message the record companies understand is dollars.  By refusing to purchase we deny them the incentive to continue this abhorrent destruction of our \\"fair use\\" rights.  It is a great disappointment that the band themselves will suffer royalties, especially with what seems to be a very good album.  But to purchase this album would be to condone and even encourage other bands and record companies to release other protected albums, or worse, other more diabolical schemes to prevent ripping.  I like the convenience of listening to my music collection via my Sonos, iPods or on my computer, and NO record company will EVER remove my right to do so. <br /> <br />Please, show the record companies what a mistake they're making with these heinous INEFFECTIVE copy-protection schemes.  \\"Voting with Dollars\\" is the *only* thing these capricious b*stards understand.  The legal customer is the one that pays the most -- if I wanted to download/steal this album off the internet it would be trivial.  Why punish your honest, loyal customers the most ?

B000002JNJ|5|I got into Pantera a little late, and man i was missing out.  I can't believe how good they are. I only have 2 of their cds so far, but I'm going to keep buying them because they're really solid.  There's not a bad song on here, you can listen to the whole cd.  Pantera is one of the best metal bands around, and definitely one of the heaviest.  Dimebag's riffs and solos are unforgettable.  Vinnie Paul is one of the best drummers today.  You can hear the bass pretty well, and Rex is definitely really talented.  Then there's Phil, who is one of the best, actually probably the best singer in thrash.  He has a great growl and a powerful yell, but also a great singing voice(and he does sing), and a great falsetto scream(similar to Rob Halford at times).  The lyrics are pretty interesting, whether you agree or disagree with them you have to admit theyare definitely not mindless and stupid like some of the [stuff] coming out today.  Buy this cd(and other stuff b Pantera) if you like Metallica, you'll love it.

B002ZG981E|1|six month ago i purchased two-disc edition, but it had not reviewed (did not have the BR-Player).  Only now i bought de Blue-ray player and I realized that was not BR disc only DVD disc.  I know it's late to make a claim but... I am unhappy ...
B000HL093A|5|I should warn the reader that I am a grad student in philosophy so my review drifts off into fairly lengthy discussions of some of the philosophical issues raised by this film. If that kind of thing does not interest you I would suggest skipping my review.<br /><br />This is, apparently, one of the most controversial movies ever made. That, on its own, does not necessarily make it a good movie but the movie does possess one quality that I think all genuinely good movies should possess, and that is memorability. I do not actually watch very many movies but sometimes even I have trouble remembering what happened in movies I know I have seen. Hollywood churns out so many movies and so many of them are just not memorable at all. Whether you love it or hate it there is no doubt that Natural Born Killers is memorable.<br /><br />I just re-watched Natural Born Killers, it had been years since I had last seen it, but there were scenes that I still remembered and that were still very vivid in my mind even years later. The scene where Mallory's incestuous and abusive family life is portrayed as a sitcom, with a laugh track that is activated after her father's incestuous comments, is one of the most memorable scenes in all of cinema (interestingly Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the original script for Natural Born Killers which was then heavily re-written apparently, really detested that scene and walked out of the theater. I would be very curious to know what he detested so much about that scene since, to me, it is one of the most interesting scenes in the movie).<br /><br />Despite being over the top in many ways the movie still succeeds in presenting real characters with true emotions. The characters are full blooded and well drawn. Mickey and Mallory are mass murderers and the movie does not shy away from that. But despite being a killer Mickey is still sentimental and romantic and Mallory is still insecure and jealous. People are fascinated by evil so a lot of times in movies like this they purposely make the characters as inhuman and evil as possible. This movie chose to present mass murderers as full blooded, and believable, human beings and I suspect that is partly what led to some of the controversy surrounding the film.<br /><br />The movie also avoids what I think is the biggest problem I have with almost everything put out by Hollywood: false emotion. Almost everything Hollywood puts out is so full of sentimentality and false emotion. In most movies and television shows there will be a moment of \\"emotional truth\\" where the character finally comes to some self-realization but when they attempt to express their insight it always feels to me like they are reading right out of a psychology textbook. Everyone feels the way they think they are supposed to feel rather than how they actually do feel. I think there are probably people who live their life that way but it seems very difficult for movies to reach any kind of emotional truth. They almost always blow it, in my opinion, either by simply quoting the textbook or by attempting to over dramatize it. This movie avoids all of that. There are realizations in the movie but they ring true rather than false (like when Mickey and Mallory are with the Native American in his hut and Mickey says, \\"You feel the demons in here Mallory\\" and she says, \\"I think we're the demons\\").<br /><br />The movie is also cinematically brilliant. It is shot in a very unique way cutting between black and white and color, real life and cartoons, with strange projections often playing in the background. That is part of what makes the film memorable and it can be disconcerting at first. The first time I saw the movie I really did not know what to make of it but the second time I watched it I felt like it all made sense and worked really well. The cuts often allow us to see the \\"outer\\" event and the \\"inner\\" event. The best example being from the opening scene in the diner where the waitress says something, it cuts to black and white and she says it again but in a way where it becomes clear she is flirting with Mickey, the inner meaning of the event is portrayed, which then explains Mallory's rudeness to her (and the fact that she cheats in her einee-meanie minie-moe game).<br /><br />The movie also deals with a number of interesting themes. Of course in interviews Oliver Stone always highlights the theme of the media and the way in which the media portrays violence. While this is certainly a theme of the movie I do not think it is the most interesting theme and, like T.S. Eliot, I do not think that artists are always the best interpreters of their own work. Oliver Stone may have meant the movie to be an indictment of the media but I think the movie is more than that, and much more interesting.<br /><br />Art, in my opinion, is about much more than aesthetics, or, what is sensorially appealing. Art should aim (like almost all human endeavors) at self-knowledge. One could blame the media for the sensationalism of violence but I do not think that the media is really capable of force feeding us something that we do not already have an appetite for. The really interesting question is a question that few people want to ask: what is it about human beings that makes us crave violence? Why do we like watching television shows about mass murderers and serial killers? Why do we like watching natural disasters on television?<br /><br />Some reviewers criticized Stone for pointing his finger at the media while being unable or unwilling to point it at himself. That may or may not be true of Stone (I do not know the man) but it does not seem to me to be true about the movie. Anyone who watches this movie, enjoys it, and then criticizes the media without asking themselves why they like watching a movie about mass murderers turned into celebrities is lacking in self-reflection. That is the truly interesting question. But it is not a question that we like to ask.<br /><br />One of the defining moments in the movie for me is when they are interviewing the teenagers who are fans of Mickey and Mallory and one of them says, \\"Of course we do not condone murder\\" but you can see the light in his eyes as he says it and the fascination, and even admiration, he feels for Mickey and Mallory. He is not lying. He really does believe murder is wrong. After thousands of years of moral education we are all ready with the judgment \\"murder is wrong\\". And that is a good thing. But there is still that strange fascination with violence. It is like an ancient and unused altar of human sacrifice standing in the square of a modern, civilized city. We are civilized human beings now but there is still this relic of something ancient within us. It is an artifact that we cannot quite explain. It is, I think, similar to what Edgar Allen Poe called \\"the imp of the perverse\\".<br /><br />I recognize it in various forms. For example, I was watching a show recently on super volcanoes. There is apparently a super volcano underneath Yellowstone National Park which, if it were to erupt, could be catastrophic for life on earth, and as I was watching I noticed a strange phenomenon. On the one hand, I wanted the scientists to say something reassuring like, \\"it is not expected to erupt for millions of years\\", or \\"of course, even if it does erupt we will have some warning and it will not destroy all life as we know it\\". But there was also a part of me that wanted the opposite, and that wanted them to say, \\"we have no idea when it might erupt\\", and, \\"if it does erupt it will wipe out life as we know it\\". This, to me, is part of the same strange phenomenon that this movie is addressing. We hate and fear violence and we find it morally repulsive, and yet, we are fascinated by it.<br /><br />Natural Born Killers is a violent movie but I think the controversy has more to do with the fact that it holds up a mirror to ourselves. We want to identify with our moral self and banish that strange relic from ancient times, or project it onto others, but, as Mickey says during his interview, you cannot run from your own shadow. There are plenty of movies that are more violent than Natural Born Killers but I think part of what makes Natural Born Killers so shocking, and why it raised so much controversy, is because it implicates us in that violence.<br /><br />We love violence but we also like to keep a safe moral distance from that violence. That is partly why we are so fascinated with the holocaust. We can indulge our fascination with violence, we can peer into the heart of evil, and exercise our moral judgment at the same time. We do not want to admit our fascination with violence so we turn it into a moral lesson. What is shocking about Natural Born Killers is the way in which it forces us to look at the violence within ourselves. We do not get to project our own violence onto the Nazis or anyone else. We see our own fascination with violence and I think people find that disconcerting. I know I do. Like everyone else I like to identify with my better nature, the angel on my shoulder rather than the demon.<br /><br />But I also believe that it is necessary for us to see clearly the violence within ourselves if we are to overcome it. Otherwise we act it out unconsciously. We identify with our moral selves and project our shadows onto the Nazis or the serial killer on television while exercising subtle forms of cruelty within our own daily lives. The one character in the movie that recognizes the demons within Mickey and Mallory on first sight is the Native American character but he is also the only character who does not engage in hypocritical forms of moral judgment. The cop and the warden both consider themselves morally superior to Mickey and Mallory, the warden scoffs when Mickey says that all God's creatures commit murder, and yet they are both just as violent as Mickey and Mallory in their own ways. The Native American character, however, knows and recognizes the demon, i.e. he is conscious. And he is the only character that has any kind of positive effect on Mickey and Mallory and who is not simply a part of the chain of perpetuating violence.<br /><br />Ultimately I think this movie deserves the highest praise for raising all of these issues and dealing with them in a fairly profound and also entertaining way. I read that this movie was originally based on a story by Quentin Tarantino but that Oliver Stone and company made some major changes to the script. Quentin Tarantino was apparently not very happy about their changes. On the one hand, I can understand where Quentin Tarantino is coming from. I would not like it if someone totally rewrote something I had written either. On the other hand, I am glad that it wound up being an Oliver Stone movie rather than a Quentin Tarantino movie. I have a feeling that I would not have liked the Quentin Tarantino version nearly as much. I do not have anything against Quentin Tarantino, I do like some of his films, but I have never liked a Quentin Tarantino movie as much as I liked this film, and no Quentin Tarantino movie has ever inspired the kind of philosophical thoughts in me that this movie has inspired. While I can understand Tarantino's frustration, from the standpoint of art I think things worked out for the best...f Mickey and Mallory and one of them says, \\"Of course we do not condone murder\\" but you can see the light in his eyes as he says it and the fascination, and even admiration, he feels for Mickey and Mallory.

0393312836|5|oh, woe is me... i feel really d'oh! for not getting this book earlier! honestly i've been thinking of getting it for years but never actually got around to it until i borrowed it from my college library early this year... what can i say?<BR>  the events in this book took place in the near future... and the world is a weird sort of place. the protoganist, alex is a really bad sort and well, he's really, really, and i mean *really* violent. the problem is, it's by choice. to make things interesting, he comes from a normal family (as normal as it goes; no history of violence, neither rich nor poor sort) and he basically has everything just fine... but, he's not fine. he gives a new meaning to the phrase 'bad to the bone'. not many authors write stories in which the main character is the evil one, and burguess does it without stereotyping that evil/bad ppl have no soul blah, blah, blah but he protrayed alex as a person who sees nothing wrong with violence, in fact, he crave it. now herein lies the problem - how to make readers sympathize with the character. that's the normal recipe for most book, but you know this is not just a normal book.<BR>  burguess is simply amazing, and i can't seem to stop sayng that. i'm not gonna go in detail on how alex wound up in prison, suffice to say, he was caught, incarcerated, but our clever alex found a way to beat the system and get his ass out from jail. how? by offering himself as a guinea pig for an experiment to eliminate evil from oneself... scary eh?<BR>  i don't condone any of alex's excesses, but i tell you, i found myself sympathizing with his dilemma. the experiment worked, amazingly and alex is 'cured'... but at what price? he is in constant pain because he can't even think of doing a bad thing.<BR>  the social dilemma here is not about alex, it's about how far society/government should take responsibility on its' youth and members. do we have the right to direct a person's most treasured possession - his mind - eventhough if it's for the greater good? how can we justify it as right? shuld we make the society mindless drones that are dictated by what we think is right? dare we play god?<BR>  alex, brave alex, lost his personality, life, loves, *mind* and was brought to the edge of sanity... that, is the most amazing thing about this book. it lets the reader sees things in a totally different way. burguess didn't make it easy for himself, he wrote the book using the worst character he could dish out and make us find some common ground with alex, and *pity* his predicament! incredible.<BR>  and many ppl are simply amazed by his invention of nadsat, the amalgation of russian and english that the kids of alex's generation. it was kinda hard to understand, but the book is totally worth the effort... read it.
B000QRIGJY|5|Harry Bosch as usual- Harry against the whole LAPD.  This time I really thought they were going to fire him or press charges against  him for obstruction of justice. But  as usual Harry comes out smelling like a rose.  The book has a good rhythm to it and reads well.
B005XQLBU4|4|good on kindle and droid charge. works better on larger screens. game eventually becomes imposible.  level 5 upgrade cap reached after second game played.  deveopers should add more depth to game with more upgrades to city strutures rather than just rebuilding.

Furthermore, it gives you some practice questions for each section! Some of my friends had proven a 7 bands on all of the sections.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Seth Hubbard writes a holographic will cutting out his ungrateful, unsupportive children and grandchildren from any inheritance and leaves 90% of his estate to his black housekeeper Lettie, after which he plans his suicide by hanging; but not before nominating one of the town's young lawyers, Jake Brigance, to handle his will and estate. Seth has studied the legality of such a will and knows that it is defensible, but he expects his adult children to put up a fuss, and believes that Jake can ensure that his last wishes are respected.<br /><br />It seems a rather simple plot, until the full value of Seth's 20+million estate is determined, and the various parties line up with their own lawyers, trying to prove that Seth lacked testamentary capacity, that we was overwhelmed by the pain drugs he was taking for cancer, that his housekeeper unfairly influenced him. Jake gets plenty of support from his former disbarred partner and from other shady characters, many of whom seem to have a drinking problem.<br /><br />Racism is alive and well in the small town of Clanton, Missisippi, and one of Jake's primary concerns is seating an impartial jury with a reasonable balance of blacks and whites, to listen to the case of the largest inheritance ever known in those parts.<br /><br />As usual in a Grisham novel, there is plenty of legal wrangling, side deals, greedy lawyers, corruptible witnesses, etc. There are numerous sub-plots revolving around Jake's prior cases, Lettie's no-good husband and family hangers-on, the strong-minded judge assigned to the case, and the search for Jake's long-lost brother. Just when the plot seemed to be predictable, a big twist is interjected, with a surprising conclusion. Though not quite as engrossing as some of the early Grisham novels, &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; is an entertaining page-turner right up until the end.
B00JGWZV5M|2|eh.  Not very engaging.  I used it for about 30 minutes total and then erased it.
B00GH4R95C|3|If you like special effects this one's for you.  If you like a good story and, maybe, a plot don't waste your time
B0052RE4MQ|4|This was a good sequel, but not as good as Matched in my opinion.  The back and forth in Ky and Cassia's perspective made it a little confusing at times and it was a bit slow in some parts.  Still a good, quick read.  I'm ready for the conclusion!
B00M55C0LK|5|Great price and performance.
B007J4T2G8|5|This book is so deep on so many levels. You become part of the story feeling everything that is meant to be felt. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B000I9UA8U|5|One of my favorite feel-good films.
B000005ALN|4|Bought this CD when it came out and like it just as much now as then. Really like the sense of melancholy about it. It's clear George is quite sad and bitter at this point in his life and if you're feeling down, this is really soothing. The message, I think, is hopeful, though: &quot;I'll be fine&quot; sings George. Also it's a very honest album, unlike much music by superstars. Strangest Thing about the best thing George has done and agree the You Have Been Loved is outstanding.
0385340990|5|There are few books I read that leave a warm, lasting impression on me.<br />Kidd's \\"Secret Life of Bees\\" and now this one.  I couldn't put \\"Guernsey Literary Society\\" down.  What a gift these two authors have given to me.  It's one I'll reread again and again.  Do yourself a favor, read it and enjoy!
B000K7VHQ4|3|Was a little disappointed, but still a fairly good movie. Would classify this movie more of a romantic fantasy than drama. None of Eisenheim's illusions could possibly be performed by an illusionist from any era. All are achievable solely by using special effects. At the end, when Inspector Uhl works out all the steps that led to the final conclusion, we are still left with a lot of holes that need to be explained before we can accept all that happened. The movie's plot requires each character to react in a precise manner in order for the final plan to succeed. While still an enjoyable film, it's recommended that you leave logic and common sense at the door and just enjoy the film for what it is.
B00MU79IL8|5|Enjoy both artists. CD is great. No problem with sound.
B00003CXTG|1|I was thinking this would be the next &quot;Titanic&quot; but I walked out very disappointed. The story was SO STUPID that it made me sick. This movie had the potential to be great but it turned out to be trash. I'll just say this; whenever the girl in this movie falls in love with a guy...that guy dies. If she's lucky he comes back to life. Her only problem is she's already in love with her dead lover's best friend. This would be a good movie if the story wasn't SUPPOSED to be about Pearl Harbor. It ended up being a Ben Affleck love story.
B00TEAVEY8|4|keeps your mind active.
B003UPPO2G|5|Great seeing them on DVD it's to bad they don't tour anymore or even perhaps come out with new material.<br />I know the public would welcome them back and then some.

B003ELKNH2|5|Product as expected
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Love it I started playing it with my kids and now I play it way more then them. And they get mad at me because I ended up putting them on a harder board
B00G5G7EXY|5|This is a very good film. While it is for kids, it has a story that truthfully transcends all ages, teaching us all that, in the end, we have a choice over good and evil. We can love and be compassionate, or we can bring misery on those we fear or think might hurt us in some way. The characters are so Disney-ish and delightful. Good film, fun!
B00COGY2P2|2|Horrible plot and acting.  This is the type of movie you will always regret having watched.  Do not do it.
B008JGSM6G|5|This game will certainly put your brain to good use. Great brain exercise. Just when you think it's impossible and you want to give up, the competitive side of you won't let the game win. Great for all ages.
B00IINPXLW|5|I think it is good.But not many people play it that much anymore.I Don,t know why?We should try to make other people play it like your family friends I Don,t care just encourage other people to play this game!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
B006LSZECO|5|Love the various perspectives, twists and turns!  Highly recommended even if you have already seen the movie.  You thought Amy was diabolical there just wait until you learn how she thinks!  Stunning work!!
B002MQYOFW|5|I LOVE this book!!! It's very detailed and you can see how the movie is related to it, but the book explains the events that are happening very well. LOVE IT!!!! :)
B00IIUATDM|5|80's fueled debauchery at its finest. But not a movie for small children.
B0070Y46UY|5|I actually read this while travelling in southern India, and know the areas that are referenced in this story.  And, en route home, I saw the movie on my flight back to the US.  I allowed myself to be swept away by the story and was surprised at the ending.
B0010SKUYM|5|I read a lot of books, and this one resonates with me. Most I forget as soon as I read them, but not this one. Thank you for sharing this story, Patrick Rothfuss.
B00594XOZU|4|This app has many features that regular messaging doesn't. You can see when a message has been sent, delivered, even read. If you are in the conversation mode, you can tell when the person you are talking to is typing.<br /><br />There is only one downfall. I like to switch between using this app on my phone and my kindle. When you sign into the other device, your current conversation history disappears.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Very good book, tear jerker for sure. But as in the book, I want to know the rest of Hazel's story. Well worth the purchase.

B004YW4L5K|5|Interesting perspectives and concept.
B00005JPAD|3|I suppose it's faint praise to say that one of the brighter points of The Departed is a solid performance by the now bloated and pasty Alec Baldwin. After the shock of seeing his face is such a sad state, you realize he's become a character actor. And a good one. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific, too. He makes the most of a terrific character with poorly written dialogue. It's a testament to his immense talent. The rest of the cast is so-so, with Nicholson reduced to a self-parody. He's fun for a while, but a weak link in a pretty strong cast. Matt Damon makes the most of a lousy role brimming with bad lines. To the extent he pulls it off, it's on charisma only. The worst performance of the lot is the only female character to speak of. Vera Farmiga simply isn't up to the task, and you end up focussing on her nose job. How she made it past auditions is not only a mystery, but a shock.<br /><br />The Departed is weak where it should be strong. We get a small glimpse of the possibilities when DiCaprio's character trails Damon's character. It gives a hint of the cat and mouse possibilities of having a mole stalking a rat -- cool stuff, but a completely wasted set of possibilities. At moments where you think the dramatic tension ought to get ratcheted up, it falls flat. And then there are twists for the sake of twists, with weak pay-offs and even weaker set-ups.<br /><br />I gave this movie a 3 because of DiCaprio. I liked his character and his performance immensely. He makes you engaged when, by all rights, you shouldn't be. He dominates the screen and the film. It's worth seeing for that alone.<br /><br />By the way, the final image in the movie may be the silliest, most pathetic thing I've seen in a while. Dumb, dumb, dumb.
076115678X|5|One afternoon as I was browsing the shelves in my local county library I suddenly saw the words, \\"Curly Girl\\" and I was intrigued enough to check it out and bring the book home.<br /><br />All my life I have battled, hated, and been ashamed of my *ugly* naturally curly hair. I am the only curly girl in a family of people with stick-straight hair. When I was a child, my mother always complained that my hair looked \\"like it was combed with an egg-beater.\\" I so wanted to feel long, swinging hair on my shoulders that I pinned scarves to my head. My mother always threatened that if I didn't take better care of my hair; i.e.,control its unruliness, she would cut it off. And just before my 3rd grade field trip to take a boat cruise in the harbor, that is exactly what she did! I was humiliated to discover that with the ocean's humidity I looked like a poodle! In my teens I slept on rollers as big as orange juice cans and even subjected my hair to a home-straightening kit, which ruined it and caused it to break off and thin. In my 20's I learned that if I kept my hair cut really short and used a big round brush to blow-dry it, my hair would be smoother. But the results never were exactly as I'd hoped and never lasted. Give me a rainstorm, fog, sweatiness, or too much handling, and it would all come undone. For years I wouldn't allow my husband to touch my hair for fear that my hair would revert to its natural state. (Not too romantic, heh?)<br /><br />About 15 years ago at my *staight-haired* sister's urging, I tried using a diffuser when blow-drying my hair. Unfortunately I knew nothing about technique. I was living in the Desert Southwest and was still dutifully shampooing my hair every morning to remove the ton of hair products I loaded onto it the previous day and then blow-dying it before I went to work. The result of my efforts with the diffuser was that my hair was dry and brittle and frizzy. When I would unexpectedly catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror or window Iwould think, \\"who's that!\\"<br /><br />Massey's book was a revelation from the beginning and I actually read it through in one sitting. The next day I followed her suggestions and was amazed at how much curl I actually had in my hair, even short. The 2nd day I read the labels on my haircare products and tossed out the ones with the drying ingredients, and even bravely disposed of my round styling brushes. Once I embraced my curliness, I decided that I really needed to grow it out some since without blow-drying, it looked really short! Each day my hair seemed to get shinier and by following the styling advice in Massey's book, my technique improved too. I haven't gotten a single negative comment or look from my friends and family. (Indeed, they are relieved that I am no longer so hair-crzed and dissatisfied with its appearance.) But best of all, I have come to terms with my curls and even discovered that I like the way they look and I am proud of them. I am so glad that I discovered \\"Curly Girl: the Handbook\\" that day in the library. I wish there had been a book like it years ago when I was really young. It has changed my life for the better.
B0027MJU00|5|I purchased \\"Dark Places\\" after reading Flynn's brilliantly written \\"Gone Girl\\".  This is an incredibly disturbing book that I couldn't stop reading.  I felt physically exhausted after reading it - but in a delicious way. The story is gruesome and sorrrowful but Flynn can write! Her characters will haunt you long after the book is finished. As a bonus, she has a wickly, wonderful wit that comes when you least expect it.  This book (or any of Flynn's books) is not for the squeemish. However, if you've been wanting a writer who doesn't waste a word - Gillian Flynn is your new favorite author.  What a writer! Never a dull sentence!
B00N1JQ2UO|5|Way better movie than I expected.  When I went to see it in theaters (because my friend forced me to), I was expecting some terrible, live-action kids movie.  I was completely surprised at how funny and good this film was.  Pre-ordered it the same day.  Thank you!
B00C1BUYX4|5|Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent as Lincoln. His performance made the movie (for me).  Great period piece movie and glimpse of history.

0515153656|2|Can't hold a candle to Parker, Coben, or Connelly. More plot holes than Swiss cheese, illogical character actions/choices, and the love interest is something from a teen romance novel.
B009ZQC7MY|5|The series is so well done!  The characters are become very developed and the plot thickens through every season.  I'm looking forward to the 4th Season.
B0042K4QK4|1|Terrible, terrible, terrible, in every respect.  The only redeeming quality is attractive females in bikinis, which is probably the only reason this show received a green light in the first place.
B00FJ2YTLK|5|Best trilogy series I've read in a long time!
B00EL8I8IS|4|Love Brad Pitt....intresting movie and enjoyed the action
B00008GKEG|5|Make no mistake--this is a spectacular Beatlefest for both casual fan and die-hard alike.  Every stage of their career is here, and for many, this is the one place to glimpse lots of rare footage and to understand--even better than the accompanying CDs--exactly how the Beatles worked in and out of the studio, and how their songs were made. <br /> <br />But it's also an extremely sad story.  I have been a Beatle fan since the early 1970s, bought all their albums, saw all the films, read as many books as I could get my hands on, and yet never really, fully realised how ugly and brutal their breakup really was, or how sick of the whole Beatlemania thing all four were (only Lennon was the most honest in his Rolling Stone interviews).  One clearly gets a sense of the extreme exhaustion all four members suffered when they gave up touring in 1966, and how sick of the \\"longest cocktail party\\" they had become by 1969.  Perhaps the Anthology focuses too much on uncovering the horrible, honest truth of The Beatles, but it perhaps also stands as a testimony to their collective genius that they continued to make such great music even to the end.  Watch these DVDs and prepare to see The Beatles as you've never seen them before.  They are a more comprehensive view than the overblown (and overpriced) CD sets.
B008Y77O4G|5|One of my favorites! Have watched it many times! Great story and excellent acting!
B00628RFPM|5|Very emotional. Loved it.

B00C8S9W0G|5|As always her tomes are remarkable in the scope and the many different characters she creates.She is a master at creating interesting plots for all her characters to engage in It does take her a long time to write her books, but they are MORE than worth waiting for..I'm sad to see the end of Claire and James Fraser however.I think this is her last book in this series., Outlander.
0844663662|3|I never knew much about World War II until novelist Kurt Vonnegut made me feel like I was living during that time.  This novel, Slaughterhouse Five is based on Kurt Vonnegut's own experience in World War II. Vonnegut's writing in Slaughterhouse Five combines a mix of science fiction, antiwar sentiment as well as a great deal of autobiographical detail. Vonnegut is very much like the protagonist Billy Pilgrim.     The writing style is captivating, and he makes his point in an inventive manner. The writing style of this book gives you a sense of the place it is set in. The writing style vivifies the reader's perspective on how tempestuous the war was. His writing was a kind of therapy. He was present at the Dresden firebombing and those parts of the novel are based on his own experiences. But it took him a quarter century to bring him self to write it, and he approaches the traumatic event cautiously, circling around it, trying to keep it at a distance with humor and a matter-of-fact tone that fails to cover the pain. This is Vonnegut's most powerful book.    Billy Pilgrim has an interesting demeanor. He goes from his birth and childhood to the moment of his death. In between he is an optometrist in Ilium, the sole survivor of a plane crash, and a captive in a zoo on the planet Tralfamadore where he is mated to a porn star. Jumping through these times in his life it leads Billy to the pivotal point in his life when he was chaplain's assistant in World War II. Then Captured by the Germans and is present for the firebombing of Dresden.    I loved this book. This book helped me understand our history and how it is so painful to have fought in war. Vonnegut said, \\" Life is easier if we accept our past.\\" This makes me respect Vonnegut more since, he wrote this book even though it was really hard for him to do so. I would recommend this book for teens and older as it does contain substantial profanity and sexual material. This book is a great book to talk to others about because it creates questions as to what started the war, what were the motivations for each side and what they may have thought of the bombing of Dresden. This book is full of passion, and life experiences and is a book no one should go with out reading
B00ESNDQWY|5|Love a strong woman story

0439023483|5|Loved this book! the story line is different from anything I have read. Tactical,Katniss has some hard choices to make but they all revert back to helping the ones she loves. good mix of nature, love, drama,action,glamour,hunting, and evil government- a true hearted tale.  I was such a tom girl growing up- but still such a girl,and this book caught my interest immediately from the first pages, I highly suggest reading this book.
B004NOH9LC|2|This was a typical romantic comedy- but not as romantic and not as funny. I will probably never watch it again, but it wasn't unwatchable so I gave it a 2
B004X6PRO6|3|Although this book is well written and researched it was much too hard to read about the subject matter. I had to force my way through it as it was a book club book. However it is very topical and thought provoking
B00406UK7S|3|[brief review:  the time is 117 A.D.  The place is north Britain, near the boundary of present day Britain and Scotland.  The natives to the north, the Picts, are wrecking havoc on the border and the Romans are having difficulty maintain their power on the border.<br /><br />A Roman general is captured by the Picts.  One of his leutinents then stages a raid on the Pict camp to free the general.  They are unable to free him, and during that time kill several Picts, including the son of the Pict leader.<br /><br />The Pict people vow revenge and the leutinent and several of his soldiers try to escape the camp and survive with hopes of meeting  back with the Roman legion on the west territory.]<br /><br />first, I'm a big fan of the director, Neil Marshall, who also made \\"The Descent\\", \\"Dog Soldiers\\", and \\"Doomsday\\".  Characteristic of his films (including \\"Centurion\\") is violence, which is always well-shot.  Also characteristic of his films is great cinematography, which \\"Centurion\\" is probably the best example of.<br /><br />The plot of this film is straight-forward tale of revenge (by one party) and survival (by another party), set in a historical back-drop.  This was a fun film to watch, but I would recommend you also watch the three aforementioned films he has previously done to fully appreciate this director.
B0065CCM76|5|Great classic rock and roll. Great album for anyone who loves the classics.  Love the mix of  live and studio release.
B00005JLZN|5|This movie was very well done.Kevin Spacey is a great actor , as well as Kate Winslet (of the Titanic) and this film does NOT dissapoint.<br /><br />The whole movie revolves around a death row advocacy group who David Gale (Spacey) belongs to, called \\"Death Watch\\" His \\"victim\\" for whose murder he is incarcerated FOR , also heads this group .<br /><br />With only a few days to go before his execution,Winslet is sent to the prison to interview him,and the more his story unfolds ,the more horrified she becomes that he is innocent and about to die. In a race to prove this,  we are kept on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />The plot unravels one layer at a time,and builds to a shocking conclusion.I won't spoil it, just see it, if you like well written,well acted,highly entertaining movies,you'll like this one.<br />It is so well put together, and I don't understand why this movie was so overlooked. It should have been an award winner!
B00CATSONE|5|A book not only about an incredible person who practically invented our current world as we know it but an amazing motivational, inspirational piece with a lot more information of what it takes to get where you want to be or what you want to become and give to the world. Great book indeed.
B0070Y46UY|5|The story is fantastic and the descriptions put you in the raft, living the adventure with Pi. It is really hard to put down.
0446677450|4|Rich Dad, poor dad is a great book. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a book that will discuss how to how to think about money and making money.<br /><br />The book's author writes weekly articles on finance.yahoo.com. Read at least one of  his columns before buying the book. You will get a good feel of what the book is all about, and what to expect out of it.<br /><br />The book is excellent, but it can be very frustrating for someone looking for a \\"recipe\\" or clear strategy on how to make money.<br /><br />The book talks about accumulating assets, and he defines assets as things which will create a positive monthly cashflow. According to the author's definition, your own home is not an asset. He sees it as a liability, since most people have to pay monthly expenses such as mortgage, utilities, and maintenance.<br /><br />He hammers on the point that your expenses should be below your income, and stresses that you do not need money to make money (You can borrow your from bankers, friends and family, even credit cards in order to buy cashflow producing assets).<br /><br />This book will NOT teach you how to invest on any market (real estate, stocks or bonds).<br /><br />The author stresses that you should look for other books, tapes, seminars about strategies for making money (such as buying real estate properties).<br /><br />Bottom line: Buy the book if you want to change the way you see money. Do NOT buy the book if you are looking for specific investment advices and money making strategies.<br /><br />Specially if you are looking at investing in Real estate I would suggest looking at other books.<br /><br />Mari  @  Georgia-Agent.com

0880381736|5|You will definitely enjoy this book!  Often times, a reader will establish a &quot;favorite&quot; character in a series such as this, and I assure you that your favorite(s) will be known early on.  From the battling Draconians  to the hidden and unfolding love story, this &quot;beginning&quot; is the  best reading that you will come by in quite a while..  Enjoy the humor of  Tasslehoff and follow the complexity of Tanis as well as Raistlin, all of  the characters are some of the best laid out in a long while....From this  book, your Journey begins...
B00881VLCE|2|Didn't really care for this; probably because I am not a real game player and didn't give it enough time.
B00EMXBDMA|5|This book was very interesting as Mark attempted to survive getting left on Mars but at the same time managed to be funny at the same time.  Definitely recommend that you read this book.
B0055S348W|4|Will this app operate properly from the Kindle Fire?  I would certainly buy it again if it does.  It certainly does as advertised.
B0050PYNO4|4|What can I say ..... it isn't the greatest of movies, but it is one that you can just sit back and enjoy and I didn't see the twist at the end coming...
B007JMW46U|5|I was enjoying one of the new Downey/Law remakes and decided to check out the rich writing that started it all. Those screenwriters have nothing on on Sir ACD. Engrossing and fun.
B009NPA3Q4|3|I like some of the songs but others may take sometime to enjoy.  I would have preferred more acoustical arrangements.
B008Y2FRFO|5|Once you play for awhile every day you accumulate so many coins y you can't get rid of them they just keep getting higher and higher. I am over 2100 coins and still climbing
B00J1IQUYM|4|Station Eleven has plenty of company in the ever growing post-apocalyptic genre, yet stands apart as a story that explores the death, survival, and adaption of the qualities that define humanity after the global reset button has been pushed. The exploration takes place through a number of stories, gradually told by characters through vignettes from before, during, and after the apocalyptic event, that eventually interconnect to complete the novel. The writing is excellent, painting a vivid set in which intriguing characters play out a well-paced and engaging script.
B007KGXY0K|1|When I purchased this motherboard, I did not realize that this motherboard has a SMBus coonector (a 5-pin VERY special and rare connector). I purchased two power supplies (not cheap) and them and many other that I have seen on internet lacks this VERY special SMBus.<br /><br />When I asked for a power supply that meet this requirement to Asus techical support service I received inconsistent responses. All enginners told me that they do not know about any power supply that meet this requirement. One of the engineers told me that if I would leave this connector without connection, the motherboard could damage. Other one told me that he does not know what happend if I would leave this without connection. And a third one told me that it would be fine without this connector.<br /><br />If Asus techincal support does not know what about this, I cannot know that by myself. Very bad!<br /><br />Update 2013-05-02<br />=================<br />The driver for Win8 x64 corresponding to the C600 LSI RAID does not install. It returns an error saying that is it not for this operating system.<br /><br />A guy from Asus who contacted me, through this (Amazon) \\"Commenting system\\", has been trying to solve the problem for more than two weeks without any success. The last communication from him was about a week ago.<br /><br />There is another pending problem with the Marvell RAID 1 volume. It is EXTREMELY slow and unstable. When I move an amount of 1 TB to/or from the Marvell RAID 1 volume, the operation aborts constantly and it caused (once) a damage in some files (which I lost). I have not opened the corresponding ticket to Asus technical support because I am waiting to solve the current problem (with \\"LSI RAID\\" driver). This unstable behavior in the Marvell RAID 1 volume is present in Win7 x64 and Win8 x64.<br /><br />My Marvell RAID 1 is made of two identical model 3TB HDs.<br />I will update this comment when new info(conclusion be generated.<br /><br />Update 2013-05-08<br />=================<br />Asus technical support service has told me that the only one way to install successfully the Win8 x64 C600 LSI RAID driver is creating a Floppy installation disk. No way to do it from the downloaded driver file.<br /><br />Marvell RAID 1 Volume performance and instability issues is still not solved.<br /><br />Update 2013-05-30<br />=================<br />It had pass 12 business days since my request to Asus Tech Support and I have not received any communication from them. Only silence.<br /><br />Update 2013-07-06<br />=================<br />Jeffrey (the Asus Tech Support) agent who contacted me through this Amazon review comment, just never answer any of my e-mails anymore. He just avoid to answer to my mails.<br /><br />I think that Amazon should allow to give ZERO stars, because some products/services really deserve that.
B001G5ZKZS|5|rush is fantastique
B002RI9HUM|4|Well founded exploration of mental illness, addiction, denial and recovery. Fast-paced and engaging. Ill read another Keyes in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is so much fun.
B00QLVY7J2|5|I love this game
B000EHSVSC|5|it came great perfect conditions on the package and the actual quality was great, didn't actually see the movie but only a part of it as it was a gift for my grandfather but he loved it.
B00CH87HF4|5|this game is so much fun. once get it, you'll never want to put it down. And who can beat the price? nobody. because it's free!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Good book as John Grisham always delivers. The ending made me both smile and cry.  I already knew that Mississippi was the worst state in the nation.
0060976624|5|Fantastic send up of the pc crowd. Enjoyed this book from beginning to end. Looking forward to reading his next book.
B008XOXGCO|4|Wasn't as good as their previous CD &#34;Science and Faith&#34;, but was still a great listen.  They had a few profane words that could have been omitted with little affect on the quality of the music.  Still one of the best &#34;new bands&#34; out there.
B0083VP2KQ|3|Yes, the CGI is more advanced and at times impressive, but also sterile and unengaging. Unfortunately, the narrative structure of the original BBC series 'Walking with dinosaurs' has been abandoned in favour of a succession of random facts and scenes. Combined with surroundings that are now completely digital, it just doesn't feel like you're there any more. It's not Walking With Dinosaurs, it's Watching Clips Of Dinosaurs.<br /><br />Next time, bring back story arc, emotional involvement, actual backdrops, Kenneth Brannagh and composer Benjamin Bartlett.
B00BAXFECK|2|I HATED IT.  ONLY KEPT READING IT BECAUSE IT WAS A PULITZER.  I WON'T DO THAT AGAIN.
B00118RPQC|4|It could be said the third installment of the Spiderman franchise was almost too amazing but the difficulties presented by the storyline are partly to blame.     Chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to be a mixed bag and though I understand the desire to appeal to a wide audience by continuing to introduce tension between the two, it has begun to distract from the film while vectoring toward the mistakes made by George Lucas in Star Wars. MJ's character has only been developed as a pretty affection but lacks substantial integration into the script which Dunst is more than capable of carrying as a pretty decent actress. It's about time to dust off the checkbook and hire decent writers such as Peter David to make sure a smooth transition between plot, sub-plot, and character development.    The special effects were over the top and by that I mean the quality level was too low to make it seamless. Excepting Venom, the film fails like those before it to capture how menacing the city is after dark and in so doing it appears as if Spiderman is just doing what the police would ordinarily be doing if it wasn't for the bizarre appearance of super villians.     The story will capture your attention though it isn't all that compelling and in closing up loose ends from the first and second film there is a lot of room for future films if producers will allow enough latitude to develop characters while incorporating the numerous other superheroes Spiderman worked with a lot of the time.     Though the film caught a whole lot of criticism, it is worth seeing and the DVD is a welcome addition to any collection.
B000VMFDW2|4|Very entertaining
B0071JXCPI|1|Within the positive psychology literature, almost everyone mentions with great praise this author and his work on &#34;flow&#34;;  as such I purchased the audiobook version and was anticipating some great insights.  Unfortunately, this has got to be one of the biggest &#34;busts&#34; out there within the positive psychology / self-help genre.  First of all, it's just plain boring; just boring.  Most importantly, the author doesn't provide any intersting / new data... which may be valid in that success, mental well being is likely (is) based more on common sense principles than some unknown mysterious force.  Nonetheless, if that's the case, why do we need a PhD to tell us that?  Furthermore, the science or the presentation supporting the authors tenents seem to be very weak;  as far as I can tell, all of the author's primary &#34;tools&#34; to be in flow were dervied from... interviews, yes the fairly unscientific method of interviews to support his groundbreaking insights on &#34;flow&#34;.  The last huge problem is, the author (as is the case with many authors) does not give an &#34;actionable&#34; methodology of how to exactly implement the concepts of &#34;flow&#34; into one's everyday life.  Sure, one can understand how a pro athlete is in flow by being completely focused on the task at hand etc... etc...  but how does one be in flow when ... doing the laundry???
B00H71PBQ8|5|Excellent series!
B0034G4P94|5|A real movie, the Rocky of our day.  Everybody played great in their parts. I was totally satisfied with the movie.  I only wish they would have shown more from Nolte's past drunken life. He makes you almost cry throughout the story from the pain of sorrow from his mistakes.
B00000J7RZ|4|this is a pretty good cd. i think that jennifer is great at singing and dancing. i've seen her live on the television so i dont know why everybody says she sings bad. i think shes not one of the best, not one of the worst, but better in the middle part. her songs and voice has a latino sound  to it and its great. there are some slow songs but hey, everyone needs to  slow down a bit once and awhile <br />and one thing. why are all you people  comparing her selena and dissin her cause she isnt that great as her? i know  selena is better than jennifer and i dont think she doesnt want to  &quot;steal&quot; selena's fame. so please,listen to the music, dont compare  her to some great legend and say shes trying to be like her.
B008JFUNHI|2|It just ran out of steam. But the twist at the end was cool. Good to watch as it was better than TV.
B00008NRI8|4|This is a romantic comedy that's actually funny!  Both stars are very good.  No one can touch Hugh Grant for this type of role.  Like every other romantic comedy, its predictable, but so what?
B00BN2NY48|5|Loved the flow of the story and all the individuals performances. I would recommend this to everybody who asked me.
B0094BB4TW|5|For me, this app works fine...Great, actually. I have a Kindle fire (the first one) and it works perfectly. No glitches, freezing, working-then-stopping, etc. But, based on all of the bad reviews, I wouldn't get it until there is an update that is proven to work for EVERYONE.
B000003S5H|5|\\"Moon Safari\\" is truly what it says it is. A journey into the depths of space and you will want to stay there. This is by far the best CD you'll ever purchase, in fact I rank it up there with Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and the Flaming Lips' \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\". Truly a classic for Stoners and people who enjoy spaced-out couch music. Every track on this album is incredible it'll take your mind and  blow it into space. Ear Candy tracks include: \\"Sexy Boy\\", \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\", and \\"Femme d'Argent\\".
B006G2ZEV6|3|great graphics and intertesting concept, but can't see the subtitles!  please update otherwise very difficult to play! galaxy tab 10.1
B005LY4B0A|1|installed this on a moto Droid and it almost bricked my phone. constant freezes or rebooting. had to remove my sd card to get enough time to uninstall it. took 3 hours to get everything back to normal.
B00IF8WSOK|3|I would rate this as a five star app if it did not crash so often.<br /><br />There is not much that is more irritating than having a work of art, just about ready to save, disappeared forever because the app crashed, yet again!<br /><br />I have the iPhone version of this app, and that version of this app has never crashed, as far as I can recall.<br /><br />This Kindle Fire HDX (3rd gen), crashes way too often.<br /><br />MACJR<br />of macjr.com
B00GX50BD2|1|This is a very dull movie.  It is an accurate, although plodding, review of Jobs' career.  Unfortunately, most of us interested in Jobs in the first place already knew all these details; so the movie adds nothing to what we already knew.<br /><br />On the plus side, the movie is very honest about Jobs' abrasive personality and the unpleasant way he treated subordinates.  But we already knew that too.<br /><br />Just about worth watching if you knew nothing about this charismatic innovator, the guy who made cell phones easy to use for all of us.
B002ZG99A4|5|this movie is a great action flick with people like stalone,bruce willis, swartzinagerand other icons of action film together.
B0043JDUNS|5|Enjoyed it and will watch again.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Not only is this game great for kids, but the game is great for adults too.This game is addicting and draws attention to the one who plays it
B0017SWPXY|4|It was slow for me in the beginning..got better midway..then it got me so interested I couldn't put it down...I found my self getting really attached to my own dog Emma....
B001P3SA8U|5|Great
B0069G5Z9K|5|awesome
B007VUCAVO|5|I really love this battery status app! It is super easy to use and it makes knowing the status of your battery levels,  and overall battery health, much easier to find than having to go thru all the settings on my kindle for the battery level estimate given by the device itself. Plus it seems to have a more accurate battery level reading,  which I prefer to the guess of the kindle meter. My dad found it first and raved about how nice and user friendly it was, so I decided to give it a shot and have been loving it ever since. I really like how it tells me how long it will take to charge, how long I have it has been since my last charge, how long it will still has left in a variety of the activities I use it for, as well as just in &quot;standby mode&quot;. I definitely give it 5 stars! Thanks for such a awesome, easy to use, and well fucntioning app. In our household it is being well used on our multiple kindles. =)
B00EJ2WBX4|5|There aren't many albums out there which can claim more than one or two listenable pieces. But &#34;The Bones of what you believe&#34; has at least 6 really well-crafted songs that demand repeated listenings and are toe-tapping classics. If synth-pop or synthesizer disco is your thing, give CHVRCHES from Glasgow, Scotland a listen.
B009UX2YAC|2|Good but not to great it could be better in a lot of ways. I personal think it needs some work, especially the prices for the characters,you might want to rethink that 95,000 is overkill thanks for understanding what I'm saying and hope that you can make some changes. Thank You!
B002MS27K4|4|The stone roses for me are probably the best band ever to come on the face of the earth, in my opinion anyway. this new legacy edition provides you with the full remasterd debut album,with bonus track 'fools gold', a full album of lost demos, including the singles and some of their b-sides and a lost demo that is called 'pearl bastard', which i reckon, with a little bit of tidying up, could of made a fantastic track. then theirs the dvd disc with the roses performing live in blackpool in 1989, which also includes three or four videos of some of the roses songs, and plus its got a great booklet inside with loads of pictures and interviews with ian brown and mani. well worth the purchase.
0553801503|4|What a disaster! You'd think after 5 long years to make this 4th installment as mind-blowing as the first 3, GRRM blows it by not including most of the major characters from the previous books..and worse, inexplicably, including dozens of new characters/viewpoints. Instead of showing us what's going on in the Iron Islands (North) with just one character, and what's going on in Dorne(South)with just one character, GRRM instead makes the inane decision to deluge the reader with no less than at least three POV's from each...why? It's hard enough to endure no Jon or Tyrion or Dany or Bran...but to replace them them with all these new characters that we cannot build any attachment to or for is just horrendous. And please don't get me started on the Brienne chapters! These chapters shall go down in history as the Jar Jar Binks of fantasy literature. <br /> <br />I originally wrote a 4-star review because I love(ed) GRRM so much I was hesitant to acknowledge how dissapointing this book was - say it ain't so, George! - but upon further thought and reflection, I felt I had to tell it like it was - George screwed up bad on this one.  <br /> <br />I feel like one of two things will happen now (neither one good for us readers): <br /> <br />1. GRRM will NOT acknowledge the vast amounts of bad feedback he is receiving for this book and we can reasonably expect A Dance With Dragons will be as poor as this one (because he has already written like 600 pages), or....... <br /> <br />2. GRRM WILL acknowledge these vast amounts of bad feedback and decide to scrap everything and do a complete re-write. (Which of course, means we shall all have to wait another 5 years for the next book).  <br /> <br />I cannot give 1 star, because the writing is indeed excellent, but it is just so very dissapointing to see how bad this book was fumbled. The previous 3 books, Cersei was made out to be this highly malicious and highly intelligent force to be reckoned with whilst playing the game of thrones - in this book she looks like a stumbling clod who is just flat-out stupid. I hope none of our other favorite/major characters do a complete 180 on how we expect them to handle themselves.  <br /> <br />Majorly disappointing.
B00AESN8XY|5|A game like I've never played and unusual but still fun and worth the $$$.. It took some creative (Twisted) minds to make this one up..<br />Thanks.
B00IG2DOKM|4|Takes a long time to do anything once you get past the basic levels. But it's still fun. A good time waster.
B0051SDM5Q|5|never had a formal negotiation trainning, though I am the perfect scenario to start implementing these guideline from day one. This was perfect for me.
B0052RDHTM|4|Enjoyed the place in history, relearned some things, and the characterizations. On to another Ken Follett book. Can't wait to begin.
B00BEIYMZ6|4|Got this within a week of ordering. Disc has a few small scratches but seems to be playing fine.
B007J4T2G8|1|I can't speak for the entire book because I only made it through one chapter.  That was enough to make a few observations.  It is poorly written, period-excessive use of elementary adjectives for starters.  This girl sounds like an inexperienced 15 year old in her first crush.  I didn't pay for this book.  I borrowed it from a friend once all the hype had died down.  I gave it back the next day.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|Love this game!  Fun, challenging, and relaxing all at the same time.  I highly recommend it.  One of my very favorite games.
6305280762|4|In her autobiography, Faye Dunaway complains that she (and her other big Hollywood pals like &quot;Bill&quot; Holden...) were just used for their names on the billboard, when the real star of this pic was the fire.  Well,  I remember seeing this movie in the theater with my parents and sister at  age 7 -- my first PG rated movie -- and I was so dazzled I couldn't sleep  that night.  All those fabulous stars of the past and present in fabulous  1970s gowns, falling to their deaths ablaze.  Susan Blakely on that tether  being scared and fabulous, Faye in her faux Halston getting it on with Paul  Newman in his office (can you believe that bedroom ?).  Mike &quot;Bobby  Brady&quot; Lookinland as the child hero.  OJ Simpson as the handsome black  man (we wont go there) And Fred Astaire gets the Shelly Winters oscar nod.  And when Steve McQueen is informed he has to go in to blow the tanks, his  profane response is so macho and sexy.  And don't you miss when the Glass  Tower wiggles at the very beginning (good old matte photography - this was  2 years before Star Wars, folks...)  I don't know -- what is NOT to love in  this movie?  All I can say is, it changed my life as age 7 and had a  profound effect on me, much as Airport 1975, Earthquake and Airport 1977  did -- all that cheese, all that hair, all those gals in danger.  But this  was the best of them.  (For the record, Poseidon Adventure was in a class  all its own - I don't think that was campy.)
B00IXF8PLU|5|This is a really well-done movie. The acting is superb, the story is captivating.
B00AESN8XY|5|Super addictive and lots of fun!
B008MA83HC|5|If you like the music of Mana this is a great compilation of their best songs in a 2 disc cd.<br />Worth it all the way!
B00607EWYC|4|This was a beautifully written book. My mind would latch on and romp through the glorious images presented.  But when I stepped back to figure out what was going on, it didn't quite come together.  The premise of the book is that an elderly and dying man is hallucinating.  So you can't really say that parts of it weren't hallucinations--a convenient set-up for the author!  But I did enjoy reading it
B00GT67UUM|5|Fun, fun, fun! I was never that good concerning mechanical and engineering type things, but I guess I was, unbeknownst to me. LOL
B000JK8OYU|5|What can I say. This for me, is the definitive album of all of the Beatles greatest hits. I love each and every one of them.
B000K7VHPU|4|This was a rather good movie. I bought it on a whim and was happy with the purchase.
B009O07NDY|4|Howard Shore creates a great soundtrack as always. The only song that was not up to par was the last one on the soundtrack, The Lonely Mountain isn't nearly as great as others he's had a hand in for this franchise. That sound is no May It Be, or Gollum's Song, or Into The West. I hope the next will be better. Over all this is still a great soundtrack.
B008Y7045C|1|cleverly done, and cleverly anti-Christian.
B00BD99JMW|5|Loved the series! I blazed through the series in a weekend. I hope there will be movies for this book and Insurgent!<br />Great book to read that I will end up reading again!
B000IFQLSW|2|Sorry, but this album is actually an album by Double Trouble featuring some old school blues greats propping up the player known as KWS.  Where is the personality of this player?  When will this player come clean and acknowledge his guitar teacher in Shreveport, LA? Mister Danny Wilder taught the player for years, and is continually \\"forgotten\\" in interviews and articles. Not only is Danny disrespected, but I actually read that the player claimed he had no lessons. A natural. Hmm. An artist who alienates those who fostered his success is truly paving the road with some bricks of bad karma. And, it is even audible. The music in this CD is neither inventive or is it that exciting. Stevie Vai had it right when he cut off the artist at the Hollywood Bowl back in 1996.  Hopefully, with time, this artist might redeem himself, but with this outing it is not evident.  Where is our generation's soul and integrity? As for the performances on this CD? Lackluster. So, two stars is generous. On the positive side, kudos for  capitalizing upon and using some truly great players, which attempt to elevate the artist to a higher level. And, the packaging is very nice.
B00RGQ4674|5|Can't count how many times I've watched it. (written by my wife)

What are you so poor you can not invest in a bunch of new jobs for people that would improve your product...my generation is so sick of the twentysomething attitude that we don't need to talk to anyone...I can not share from my personal page to my business page and I can not directly post a picture to my business page either...
B0089MXRII|4|Beautifully recounted memories of a year in the life of a Soviet youth warmed my heart and rekindled forgotten experiences from my own childhood in Poland. Twelve monthly divisions in the book expertly divided the narrative into easily readable parts. Skillful descriptive passages, such as a New Year's party for children in the Kremlin, revived my own memories of happy celebrations provided by the State-run firm of my father. 'Dacha' in the Summer, a story about a child's summer vacation during the Soviet period, would please any sentimentalist. It clearly demonstrated the importance of family and the close relationship between 'Babushka' or grandma and growing children. On a slightly negative note, I would have liked to see the stories unfold in dialogue more than description. I am looking forward to more from Ms Gousseva. Well worth the money at about 10% of the cost of a Starbucks Latte.
B00005Y228|5|I have been lucky enough to see Kylie perform at two Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parties and experience the thrill of 5,000 gay men screaming their heads off at 2am for this Aussie princess and icon. Always loyal to her audience, the Fever CD once again proves she can do no wrong. Her performance of \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" with little red devils horns and 30 male dancers in red speedos and devils horns at a Mardi Gras party is one of the memories of my pop culture infused life. Charming, having as much fun on stage as her audience, camp, coquettish and just pure pop. This album sums it all up. America, count yourself lucky Fever has relaunched Kylie in the States with a CD of pure infectious, danceable pop. A superstar here in Australia (and in the UK) for around 20 years I feel its time we share her around more. America, accept this precious gift as a sign of Australian friendship and just DANCE!<br />PS Check out the Kylie Live in Sydney DVD for the perfect concert experience.
B00I6IKSZ0|4|It's a fun game but I had a lot of friends on there. And when I came back all my friends where gone. That where deleted. Plus people ask to date. I mean it's not a dating app.
B00GRVV29E|5|Nice!
B00D6SBOWG|5|Fairway Solitaire is a lot of fun! I have a similar one from Big Fish Games on my laptop. This plays great on my Kindle Fire. It's super fun. I love the gameplay.
B00PTB7B34|5|Better in a lot of ways
0880794968|4|I began with the Original Rider Waite tarot deck and found the colors and thick lines unpleasant.  In contrast, this version of the Waite deck is beautiful.  The drawings have been retraced in a finer line and the pastel pencil coloring is carefully shaded and very appealing.  I think the images looks less cartoonish than in the standard Rider Waite deck.  This deck also has a glossy protective coating that looks like it will withstand a lot of use.  Overall the Universal Waite is a wonderful deck to use.  My one complaint is the packaging is flimsy and it's hard to get the deck back into it.  Too bad it doesn't have the same style packaging as the pocket version of the Universal Waite.  So, five stars for the deck minus one star for the packaging.
B000MRAAJW|4|This a showcase dvd to use for your new HD DVD tv or player. Picture quality is excellent and sound is also very good. We use it to encourage our children to become environmentalists.
B005PR2FD8|5|Positives:<br />The motion capture, graphics, compositing, animation, music were amongst the best I've seen; in a class with \\"Adventures of Tintin\\". Worth seeing the movie just for the visuals.<br />The story was written just well enough to sustain interest, but could have used more clarity.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />The English subtitle translations seemed disjointed.<br />The various characters were not well presented. It resulted in a confusing potpourri of shallow and disconnected characters thus disrupting the flow and continuity of the storyline.
B008JFUS5A|5|Prompt service, new as advertised
0061777250|5|Skeptic at first on the subject, I grudgingly gave this one a read and wasn't disappointed. Dr. van Lommel gives a damn good read with accounts both pro and con on the subject. I recommend.
B0001ZX0PG|4|This is one of the best DVD's I have been able to enjoy for a while.  I never saw this in the theater and I am glad that I waited.<br />The characters Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are excellent.  Throughout the movie because of Clint Eastwood's style of directing you feel as though you know who really did what and it makes sense but when you find out the truth you realize that that was the more sane explanation.  It is a real intellectual thriller. <br />The extras are good on this movie especially the commentary by Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.  WATCH OUT though, if you are watching the movie for the first time, don't use the commentary because they give away the plot and critical themes before the end of the movie.  They are pretty hilarious and that gives you a better understanding of the movie.  It helps you catch things that you would not have notice like the only time that Tim Robbins character tells the truth.  <br />I would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy intellectual thrillers.  It's not a lot of blood and guts but gives you many emotional turns from happy, to sad, to revenge, to helplessness.
B00B7Y0206|5|I love youtube because I like watching videos I put it on 23 the volume  I can't hear my mom when she is talking to me
B00DVKOYBM|4|This can be a very rewarding and frustrating game. You often play against people with similar skills as your own. Occasionally you will have to wait for server response. When this happens, it can cost you or your opponent the game no matter how many balls are left on the table. I still love the game, and it is arguably the best free pool game available. I would recommend this game to anyone that loves playing pool. The guide lines are fairly accurate, and the physics are as well.
B003XU02QG|3|This movie had lots of action and adventure. Character development was at a minimum. I would have liked to know more about the characters and a lot less bloody scenes.
B00ISJSFUW|5|One of the better movies I've seen in a while.
B00B89WXYS|5|Excellent condition!
0062009540|4|Okay, I'm hooked. I started watching the TV show when it first came out, and liked it well enough. So I decided to see how the book series would compare.<br /><br />This book follows a former group of friends three years after their leader, Alison, went missing. Now they are getting mysterious text messages from a person known only as \\"A\\". \\"A\\" knows secrets only Alison knew and trust me, these girls have plenty of them. Despite being only 16, these girls have more skeletons in their than the cast of \\"Desperate Housewives\\". The girls have to comfront secrets from their past while dealing with their issues of the present.<br /><br />I liked this book perhaps more than I'm willing to admit. Its a guilty pleasure read for sure. The girls are each different and have their own personalities. Aria is the \\"free spirit\\" who holds the secret of her dads affair, while trying to hide a tryst of her own. Emily is the chaste jock who is questioning her sexuality and overall personality. Hanna is the new queen bee desperate to stay ahead. And Spencer is the competive over-achiever who is fruitlessly trying to please her parents.<br />I liked all of the girls, despite their faults. But I did remain unattached from them through out the book. The plot is full of twists and turns and I have absolutely no idea what will happen next.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether or not I like the TV show or book series more. While they obviously have similarities, they have their fair share of differences, and I think they might be going in different directions. So as of now, I like them both.<br /><br />Next installment please!
B000FCKBCU|5|What a wonderful book.  The characters are funny and so down to earth.  The storyline is great and you didn't want the book to end.  It reminded me of all the mistakes I made when I first started out on my own.  Thank you for all the laughter and enjoyment I got reading it.
B0074YVW1G|5|After reading this wonderful book, I can confidently say that this masterpiece could have been pulled off only by an introvert. Thanks Susan for enriching me with the wealth of knowledge about the most misunderstood personality type. Without your untiring efforts, this would have stayed misunderstood for longer.
B00992CF6W|3|dosent have buckets, obisisien or barley any lava and it dosent have endermen. but other than that its freaking awesome
B008MG1E4A|5|This book is well written.as a Marine mom, it made me proud of our nation's military and the job they do.
B00GP0G0IK|4|I like this game made me think

B00N1JQ452|5|Fun movie.
B007J4T2G8|5|One of the best books I've ever read and I'll be so sad when I finish reading the trilogy!
B008XG1X18|5|I really enjoy Pinterest.I love all the great recipes,crafts and all the beautiful photo's,we have alot of crafty,great cooks and the photography is absolutley amazing.
B00026YO36|4|One of the most inventive, with the twist on a sonic inventory, recent rock album. Tom Waits is cited in many of the reviews, but this does not, to these ears, sound like a Wait's album, granted the similar vocal reach. This is quiet and reflective set for the most part, melodic, often sad, even chilling. Definitely a worthwhile experience given that there's not a wak link in the chain of tunes.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|John Grisham is my very favorite author.  His novels are always with full of suspense and defending innocent clients. The Pelican Brief is my all time favorite,
B008Q0DAXK|4|Still good after a long time
B0070NSPCU|5|Really, this was one of the best books I've read in a while, and absolutely the best indie book I've ever read. Also, for people who hesitate to read a series thats not complete yet, it ends really well and doesn't leave a big nasty cliff hanger.
B000AJIF4E|5|I had these sony headphones before. I wear them like a everyday hat. I have compared them to all of the very in style, and popular / very expensive competetors  and you cannot get better full range sound at a fair price than with these sonys. I listen to music all day with my galaxy s3,  I have  crystal clear home stereo sound  whereever I go. I am very critical about the quality of the sound I desire. You can't go wrong with these headphones whether you're  listening to jazz, symphony orchestra, or even voice sound.
B00K0OI42W|5|This is one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. It had a great impact on me when I read it so many years ago as a student, but I had not realised then, not only was the subject important, but just how well written it is.<br /><br />I understand why Harper Lee didn't feel the need to write anything else after this. Its label of &#34;MASTERPIECE&#34; is certainly well justified.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|Nice art and I like the music. The Dragon character Is pretty cute cause he's fuzzy and purple. He reminds me of spike the mlp Dragon character guy.
0811869261|5|I love the artwork, and the story is fun. Lots of facts about various countries. My three year old loves looking at the pictures and pointing out all the characters and asking what they are saying. There are stickers, though I am waiting until she's older to give them to her. The pages are made to allow the stickers to be reused, which leads me to believe the book will last a while as the pages are sturdy.<br /><br />The one downer is the US page. It wasn't very interesting. But the other pages are fun.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|my bff loves it so I want it also she loves going on the blue teem so ya she loves minecraft too
B00CM9JKQM|5|I've been a fan of the Ryche since Operation:mindcrime and Empire but boy have these guys (well actually it turned out to be all Geof Tate's fault, obvously from his other \\"Ryche\\" album) taken a nose dive after that. I will defend the guys, against many haters because Operation;mindcrime Part 2 was an excellent album but that must have been a fluke considering the band dropping their balls again on their next effort.    Anyhow, with the cancer that was Tate gone and even better which is the addtion of La'Torre at the pinacle of his talents, FINALLY, and I'll say it again, FINALLY, we fans can look forward to amazing albums from one of metal's greatest groups, for years to come. This album will wash away the bad taste of s*** records Ryche had been feeding us fans for nearly 2 decades. A must buy!
B002Y0TGOU|5|Great movie; captivating! Directed by J.J.Abrams, and can't wait to see his Star Wars at the end of 2015.
B000002NIW|5|Chino Moreno found his bucket of gold in this masterpiece.   Just about  the only thing wrong with this CD is the fact that most of the songs are  unremarkably badly titled.                Reason you ask?  Possibly because  of Chino's remarkably different style of songwriting,  or possibly because  the titles of many of the songs on this CD have next to nothing to do with  the songs. A blur indeed,  but at 10 songs  [11 with the hidden song],   this is a blitzkrieg of emotional-metal that takes the Blue Ribbon for most  innovative of its genre,  and some of the best 11 songs that every fan  should have in their collection.
B0007GAERG|5|Yes, I actually understand all the hype. I know some people are apprehensive, but if you're a real Mariah fan, then there's a good chance that you'll really dig this album. If you liked \\"Butterfly,\\" then \\"Mimi\\" should be to your liking also. The hype is for real, because collectively, this might be her best album to date. She really does utilize her voice the best on this album. Mariah does strike the perfect balance. I suppose it's hard to imagine her being as good as she was in the 90's if you keep rehashing \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Charmbracelet.\\" But Mariah is definitely back. This is the real album that people have been waiting for. Mariah is a great talent and \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is the definitive example of why.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good game, challenging but doable.
B007ZYABW6|5|lOVE THIS!!
B003O86FMW|5|Such a great book. Interesting plot. Action packed with some comic relief. Relatable characters. One of my favorite series that I have ever read.
B00JOT3HQ2|4|I enjoyed it. It's fun, entertaining, and holds the same intrigue as Flappy Bird!
B008AK8FHM|2|I was hoping for so much more when I purchased this book. I should have read all the feedback before plunking $8 toward this book. It is really painful to get through as the author drones on about his experience. I know this type of book isn't meant for entertainment, but at least make it engaging to your audience. I'm gave up on the book; I'd rather enjoy my life than have to worry about what the afterlife will be like.  I ended up switching to fiction.
B0001AP12G|5|This album is insane top to bottom.
B0063GORYU|5|I have always liked this game. I played it on my computer and I really like to be able to take it around in my kindle. The fact that it's free makes it even better!
B00005OM4N|5|Heyy! It's me again. Today I will review the album \\"Britney\\".    I'm A Slave 4 U- I like this one a lot. It is her third best hit. It is very danceable and shows a more personal side of her, by the lyrics which clearly state not to treat her like a little girl, you got it Britney. 10/10    Overprotected- I like this one as well, especially in the beginning when she talks. This one is about not telling her what to do and lay back- don't watch her like a hawk. Very fun, danceable. 10/10    Lonely- This one is a little more rock-edgy. Not like shredding guitars or anthing like that but, more rockish for her. 7/10    I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman- I like this one too. This one was from her debut movie, \\"Crossroads\\". It recived great airplay. It's a nice ballad about her growing up. A great slow-dance song. 9/10    Boys- This one is about how a girl needs a boyfriend to be in control. To my opinion, that is not true. Very danceable. Dance to it a a club. 8/10    Anticipating- This song has a very happy, little girl, bubblegum-cokkie cutter beat. She uses her soft voice even though it's an upbeat song. It kinda makes me feel uncomfortable, though. LOL. 6/10    I Love Rock 'N' Roll- OMG!!! Britney Spears butchered this song. Joan Jett yells, and screams, and plays shredding guitar solos in this song. Britney Spears adds rap, and the guitar sounds electrified, and the drums are slowed down. THIS SONG SUCKS!!! You will be laughing like I did when I heard the song. DON'T LISTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3/10    Cinderella- I like the beat to this one. It's kinda boring though. 5/10    Let Me Be- The guitar in the beginning is cool. This song is kinda mean, but has a happy beat. I think it's nice. Not danceable. 8/10    Bombastic Love- The beginning and the chorus are cool, but the verses don't fit in. 7/10    That's Where You Take Me- She uses her real voice in this one, and it sounds nice. One of my favorites. This one is actually a single, but recieved airplay in foreign countries only. Boo hoo.  10/10    What It's Like To Be Me- She's just complaining about how hard it is to be her, oh yeah, it's hard to be a million-aire. And her ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake does beat-box while she sings, which in my opinion is lame. 6/10    LISTEN TO:  im a slave 4 u  overprotected  lonely  i'm not a girl not yet a woman  boys  anticipating  cinderella  let me be  bombastic love  that's where you take me    skip:  i love rock 'n' roll  what it's like to be me
0321525655|4|Anyone looking to improve their presentations and make them more interesting and inviting should read this book. It has lots of examples and is one of the better books on the subject.
B004GJDQT8|5|My phone protector looks just as it did and came in a timely manner.
B004SJ3AXI|1|I am sure it would be great if you could actually play the game. very disappointed and frustrated with this app right now.
B0063IH60K|5|It works great on the kindle fire.  Its more fun than on the computer.  A free game to boot.  Keep up the good job!

B00004T9UF|5|It's hard to believe that this young man can hit a real social chord in a guy that is 47..I find the pathos in his lyrics and straight on voice to be quite a refection of today's misplaced young people. He has poetry and humor, and assaulting obscenity. I don't think the man could be too over rated, though a steady diet of &quot;Slim&quot; would be too much for me!He is real! At least from my perspective.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Intriguing...powerful, enchanting. Maggie Smith is an absolute delight!
B00MRHANNI|5|My tween daughter loves this album.  I'm even enjoying some of the songs.  Swift is a fantastic song writer!

B004WR125O|3|My wireless router provides great coverage throughout my house for web browsing, etc. but this Onkyo adapter can't access a strong enough signal to work in this environment.  I can stream video on a laptop, I can't even stream audio with this adapter in the same location.<br /><br />The only upside is the installation process is very simple.<br /><br />I would return the item, but it is more trouble than it is worth.<br /><br />My next try is the TP-link adapter that has better range and the same guts as this thing (so it is compatible).<br /><br />If that doesn't work, it is on to power line ethernet I guess.<br /><br />3/4/12 update--With a TP-link adapter on its way to me via Newegg/DHL, I tried firing up the Onkyo USB dongle one last time-----and this time it worked.  I did nothing different this time than the 20 or so times I tried previously, before writing this review, but now I can get internet radio with good quality from the same 65% signal that didn't work before.  I would be willing to bet that the cheaper TP-link adapter is a better purchase, however.  I upped my star rating to 3, where it will stay if this is reliable for a good long time.  At least consider the TP-link adapter, which is cheaper and reviewers say has a stronger antenna, before you purchase this.
B00CCEHR80|4|I do love this particular line up of the JGB, but I did not feel that it had the edge to it that the Warfield concert had [[ASIN:B000002VM1 Jerry Garcia Band]]. Let me be honest and say that this may grow on me more as I continue to listen to it. That I will definitely do! I was glad to see the band covering \\"And It Stoned Me\\" and that quite surprised me as I'd never seen a Van song on anything that had Jerry Garcia on it...but then I haven't heard literally everything Garcia did. Garcia doing Dylan songs was nothing new to me and I always loved his long leads on songs like \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\". I won't say run out and get this because if you are a JGB fan you will have already done so! For those that think that Jerry was just associated with the Grateful Dead, however, I would encourage you to check the JGB out. You wouldn't regret it! I'd like to say one more thing and then I'll shut up. IMHO Jerry's voice was so much clearer and better in his younger days. Voices age and change though some less so than Jerry's. Even so it is not at all unpleasant to listen to!
B008BQ8YHQ|5|This is one of the best shows I have seen in a while. It's funny and dramatic with a lot of suspenseful moments in every episode. The multiple core characters have been so well written that you instantly get attached. Every episode is like a roller coaster ride!
B0000669JL|5|OH YA! Three little birdies they keep me rockin.
B0090OW7J4|5|Can't wait to see him in concert this summer in Maine!  Not as good as his Slow Turning album, but then, NOTHING is!  This is more of the same great Hiatt music and fans won't be disappointed.  I recommend it!
B003291CBW|5|NPR aired an interview with Christopher Hitchens (not sure of date) where he discussed the writings of George Orwell. I think most people were expecting maybe a short discourse on Orwells most famous work '1984' but Hitchens instead gave props to 'Homage To Catalonia'. And after reading this 'one mans viewpoint' on the Spanish Civil War I find myself in agreement with Hitchens that this book is underrated and unfortunately overshadowed by '1984'. Although It originally did not sell well in England and even today is still rather obscure, the book should be standard reading in Highschool and College; especially in Political Science classes.  Orwells non-fiction 'Homage to Catalonia' should be a standard text for war reporting to any aspiring journalist. In a modest, sometimes witty, and almost modern travel blogger style, Orwell lays out his experience as a foreign soldier fighting with the P.O.U.M against the Franco Fascists and then later his further involvement with the internal political battles between the Communists and Anarchists in Barcelona. The following passage on pages 130-131 is a good example of Orwells style and the strength of this book,  \\"I used to sit on the roof marveling at the folly of it all. From the little windows in the observatory you could see for miles around- vista after vista of tall slender buildings, glass domes and fantastic curly roofs with brilliant green and copper tiles; over to eastward the glittering pale blue sea - the first glimpse of the sea that I had coming to Spain. And the whole huge town of a million people(Barcelona) was locked in a sort of violent inertia, a nightmare of noise without movement. The sunlit streets were quite empty. Nothing was happening except the streaming of bullets from barricades and sand bagged windows.  Not a vehicle was stirring in the streets; here and there along the Ramblas the trams stood motionless where their drivers had jumped out of them when the fighting started. And all the while the devilish noise, echoing from thousands of stone buildings, went on and on, like a tropical rainstorm. Crack, crack, rattle-rattle, roar - sometimes it died away to a few shots, sometimes it quickened to a deafening fusillade, but it never stopped while daylight lasted, and punctually next dawn it started again.\\"  Much of the book is written like the above quoted passage. Orwells clear and descriptive observations make for great reading without the need for the more modern exaggerated styles of writing that try to make every moment a life and death situation as if war is something 24/7 and 365 days a year. Orwell understands that people are human. And even the enemy must sleep, eat, and defecate at some point. The book is without flaw but you might find the constant political party references and alphabet soup of acronyms overwhelming if you don't take notes. P.O.U.M, P.S.U.C., C.N.T., and F.A.I. are just some of the abbreviated party names you will need to remember especially for Chapter 11 when Orwell attempts to sort out for the reader exactly what happened during the fighting in Spain.  This edition had a good introduction by Lionel Trilling which I recommend reading after the book as a supplement to further understanding Orwell and the politics of the Spanish Civil War.
B00H58VGIA|4|Great story of how women and men were treated in Charleston during Slavery.  Very graphic and really showed the strength of women and how they overcame adversities.
B00JMY10YU|5|Great love story, very well done.
B002WV5A9G|4|While some fans have problems with alternate timeline stories in the Star Trek universe, I'm OK with it. For the most part, it solves certain problems for writers who have the challenge of staying 100% consistent with 30 years worth of story-telling. Now I've watched this movie maybe ten times, which might be a little obsessive, but mostly I watch it for the score, which is terrific, the incredible deep space f/x, and the interplay between Spock, Kirk and McCoy. J.J.A's take on the crew of the original series is inspired, and the actors do a terrific job channeling testosterone out of my all-time favorite space adventure characters. Yes, there are a few logic holes -- and planet killer scenarios have gotten a bit blase, but this isn't so much a scifi movie with a great story as it is a vehicle for establishing the starting point for the franchise's next three to six movies. Hopefully, stories will be more important in the future, and less emphasis will be placed on OCD terrorists or revenge seekers. Abrams and others need to look at how the Borg resuscitated the Generations franchise and maybe find something other than an evil, twisted antagonist to hang their hats on.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This game is AWSOME but I can't seem to be able to wear the skins I make I hope you guys fix that :/ but still AWSOME!
B00ATDOVNK|5|Loved every second of this game. Weird premise, great graphics, excellent puzzles. Just phenomenal all around! Cannot wait for the next one!
B00D2CYU2W|4|Unlike Matthew McConaughhey and Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club, who are unrecognizable as Ron Woodroof and Rayon respectively, Michael Douglas and Matt Damon play themselves again in Behind the Candelabra, even in the highly improbable gay characters they portray. They lack depth and are one-dimensional. The movie, however, I find highly entertaining and it's more than worth seeing. The plot is based on Scott Thorson's account of the events. Accordingly, he is the good guy who falls victim to the dangerously wicked traps of the infamous Liberace. I don't buy his version. It leads me to think the movie is \\"slightly\\" homophobic in that it tries to imply that Liberace's conduct as a gay man was not honorable simply because he was gay, not straight. Perhaps, but one has to know the truth to judge and, definitely, Thorson's version is way far from it.
B000IMM3XW|5|Great movie.
B00BHNR1KQ|5|Great movie! Quality horror flick.
B000JVT1U0|5|[[VIDEOID:15738981]]Well, here it is, my first video review.  I'll apologize for this ahead of time, but I just had to try out my nifty new camera.  I know I am a far better writer than a speaker -especially when forced to sit still, but bear with me.  I also broke my usual review mold here by reviewing a product with over 200 opinions already entered on this edition alone. I usually prefer to review products that haven't been reviewed completely, fairly, or at all, but \\"The Wicker Man\\" is a true classic and I was in the mood to try something new so here it is. I could have said a lot more (and I did in my initial run at it), but file size is a big issue so I had to settle for a quickie review, but let me add that Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland are unbelievable in this film.<br /><br /> Post jokes, criticisms, and patronizing remarks below and let me know what you think.  Also, please note that I am in no way condoning human sacrifice conspiracies or frowning on Christianity here, but am just offering a view of this film from a different angle.  If you can sit through this whole review (relatively short as it is), God bless you.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Very addictive and very hard this app is worth ur time. PLEASE GET.<br /><br />Also it is very sensitive so when u tap lightly u go up normally
B009O2XY12|3|This game is okay i didn't know it was a kid's game when i selected it but it is lot's of fun.
B000001DQG|4|This is a flawed classic from Eltons golden period when he was selling more records than anybody else on the planet. There are a some all-time classic Elton tracks in the \\"The Bitch is Back\\" and \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" as well as \\"Pinball Wizard\\", which is a extra track on this CD.<br /><br />The main difference with this album over say his other classic albums of the 70's is the addition of the Tower of Power horn section. This adds some umph to the whole proceedings. So very average Elton songs like \\"Your so Static\\" and \\"Stinker\\" (both of which I love) become much funkier affairs.<br /><br />Overall then this is an underrated album, that whilst not quite as good as GYBR or Tumbleweed Connection, is far better than its given credit for.
B0031RS44S|5|Lee Childs has perfected the action hero thriller.<br />This is a classic example. A great character, great plot and all the standard elements we expect.<br />Buy (read them in order though).
B003AVMURM|5|I can's say enough about Brio train systems. Quality craftsmanship like this is hard to find and our 4 year old grandson loves to build with them. Great problem solving toy.
B00K0X1PYM|5|Great music.
B00A81MV3U|5|I have watched this over 20 times and every time I get tears of joys because the actors are portraying ordinary people with their emotional problems. It empowers you to reach for you dreams that maybe impossible! This make it a possibility! The music are masterpieces!
0425152251|5|This book is certainly imforative on the &quot;history of philsophy&quot;. I learned a lot about philosophy and European history from reading this weird novel. I have to admit, because of the translation some of the philosphy is really complicated and hard to understand until you've read the paragraph or two a few times over. <br />The story is also so far-fetched that once it developed, I was simply befuddled. I asked myself things such as &quot;where the heck did that come from?&quot;, among other things. The premise is creative once you discover it, but the last 100 pages or so are very... arbitrary and far-fetched. <br />Once the philsophy hits dialogue form instead of letter form (you'll understand it when you read the book), it becomes harder to follow, but it's still interesting all the same.<br />Recommended for sure.
B00E0MCYPS|2|I got this awhile back as a faotd. The graphics are great...controls a bit tricky to get the hang of. Overall not a bad game but in order to play the game it requires 2 things....internet connection and a current log in to the app store! Really!?....uninstalled.
B00L6Z2VPU|5|I love reading this series and I really enjoy some of these novellas and short stories Thea Harrison continues to write. I have enjoyed Pia and Dragos from the first and like many readers, was sad when I thought I was done with their characters when the book ended. But no.... Thea continues to entertain us with more about this couple and their &#34;peanut&#34;. I hope she keeps doing this. I would also love to have more of her other couples with short stories of their own.
B005S9EK5Y|5|Great price.
B005HSL626|3|its not bad but not good. you have to reeeaaaaally like it to give it more than 2 and a half stars.
B008NCSZQ8|5|The development of and evolved relationships between the characters is excellent.  It's adds a lot to have seen the prequel movies.
B009UNH0EM|1|It's a cool replacement but to cable to small that's the only thing that sucks
B00DPM7TIG|5|Beautifully written story of the love and unique training a father gives his blind daughter as WWII as the Germans invade France. And the simultaneous story of a German boy orphan with no future who stumbles on a talent for electronics that gives him a future but in the Nazi Army. There lives, compassion, daring, and the devastation of the war intersect until their lives converge. One of the most beautifully written novels I have every read. Deeply moving.
B00004TL21|3|See, i like this album, but when you compare it to deftones it's a really bad album. I will rate these songs according on how i like them.<br />1. Feitceira 7/10- its an average song. But sounds different from all the other album.<br />2. Digital Bath 9/10- i like this song for being a little different, and it's just a great song.<br />3. Elite 10/10- the best song on the album. You can jump up and down and all around with this mosh maniac of a track.<br />4. RX Queen 5/10- too slow, and undeftones like.<br />5. Street Carp 6/10- this song is okay, it's a little wierd.<br />6. Teenager 4/10- Very bad song. Too slow, nothing to it.<br />7. Knife Party 9/10- great song.<br />8. Korea 8/10- this song opened up the album a little bit, then all the other dull songs, like teenager, and RX queen.<br />9. Passenger 9/10- a very good song with the singer from tool in this song.<br />10. Change 7/10- an okay song. Not that heavy, but keeps the Deftones Style.<br />11. Pink Maggit 8/10- very good song. Back to school is in this.<br />overall, if you've never heard Deftones before, you'll like this. But if you're an old fan, you probably wont.
B00004XOWM|5|I love limp bizkit and all their songs.  Even though every 5 words is .... it is still a great cd. By it now.<br />Warning: You might want the censored version cause the explicit one is pretty bad.
B000FP2OPY|5|i really enjoyed this box set.  I am an avid fan and loved the way that this series built and in particular the developing bond between the two brothers.  The English box set did not come with the added bonuses so I purchased it from America where I enjoyed the added footage.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a little horror - complete with two sexy guys who work and interact well together - along with Urban Legends which seem to be popular.  This series has everything in it.  I have not enjoyed a series so much since I was a child. I hope it goes for a good few seasons as I am enjoying season two at the present time. <br /> <br />
B00425S1H8|5|Thanks to other reviewers here I bought this instead of more expensive<br />and less capable adapters. Highly recommend this product.
B00L23RCPU|1|If I could give it no stars I would have.  Sorry I wasted my money
B00BD99JMW|5|I can't believe it the end of this book is crazy and the last five chapters of it there is some really sad things, I hope u like it
B00992CF6W|5|this game is absolutely awesome with the hd graphics. It is one of my all time favorites to play. Great!
B00AKEMHCA|5|Cool<br /><br />This is really cool so GET IT
B00DQEB1V4|1|Had very high hopes for this. Probably too high.<br />The tip head has a bit too much give. I don't lift very high between letters when i write, everything joins together. (maybe just my problem)<br />Palm rejection doesn't work very well.<br />Power button placement is completely asinine. (Accidentally pressed CONSTANTLY.)
B00NFQT7QY|4|Really good movie.
B00HF5J9W8|5|great
B0000DFZZC|5|Sensitive, heartfelt and heartwarming yet not maudling or corny.   This is one great Hollywood epic for everyone who roots for the underdog, er. . .horse.   Seabiscuit is an Equine &quot;Rocky&quot; for sure.  It may have you tearing up at times, but that's not bad in this case.  It's a great story and there's a happy ending too.   What more could anyone want?   Wish that horse were still around.
B0000027DJ|5|This is without doubt my favourite alice cooper album - and also the only one in which I like ALL the songs. None of the songs made me think, &quot;Ahhhh, it's OK&quot; - all the songs were great. If I had to pick my  favourite, it would probably be &quot;Might as well be on mars&quot; but I  also love &quot;Feed my Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Snakebite&quot;.  &quot;Burning out bed&quot; I like too, and &quot;Hey stoopid&quot;. Hey -  just get this album, OK?
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is the best I could play this all night . It's also funny just like the movie.<br /><br />Awesome
B00VJ04TH0|5|Great
0684833395|5|Catch-22 is not perfectly written, but pretty damn close.<BR>It starts out hilarious and ends horrifying. The book is incredibly fictional, to the point of ridiculousness, but as they say, &quot;much truth is said in jest.&quot;<br />It's not perfect: Heller's scene with Yossarian in the rain near the end was a bit overdone, and if he wanted to make it dramatic and impacting, he should have written it better, but all in all with the hilarity, the brilliant irony, and the anti-war effect it leaves you after you read it, it deserves an easy 5 stars.
B007TNS6JI|5|Dungeon Hunter 3 is worth more than just free, anyone who gets this will be happy. I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys flawless multiplayer.
B00CLT31D6|2|I found this book was outdated and no longer really as relevant. Also it pushed strongly at saving the ultimate goal as opposed to any quality of life or enjoyment.
B00Y6QF0PE|3|I was very much looking forward to this book and began reading it the day it was released. I had hoped the book would have been more about Christians childhood and his relationship with Elena, but it was a rehash completely of the first book. It was reading the first book with to much of Anas conversation in it and I found it less comical, and while it is not in Christians demeanor to be funny, he needed a conscience a little like Ana's or a little more egotistical with a twist of humor for himself.<br /><br />I think I will go back to reading the original trilogy.
B0058DRUV6|4|A lot of truths to this book
B008JGSM6G|5|It's fun and challenging. It starts simple and that really helps your mindset when it comes time to solve the more difficult puzzles.
B005FLX2WC|5|Two dinomite musicans in top form. Great selection of funky, grovey blues. My favorites, I'd Rather Go Blind, and a Billie Holiday classic, Don't Explain, are exceptional.
B0091XICM0|4|I enjoyed the movie.  Its old and the effects aren't what you would see in new movies.  But if you want to enjoy an old classic movie, without swearing,nudity or gory effects, then sit back and enjoy.
B00E8KLWB4|4|It's a fun game, keeps you busy and the scenes are pretty
B007IXWL2C|3|I liked the book, liked, not loved. I find a million similarities with Twilight, just an adult version of it. The man feels a monster but she's not scared, she loves him unconditionally, he feels overprotecting with her who is instead super courageous and saves them both... etc etc. But it's a nice book to spend some time with
B005UDD1R6|1|FREE APP TURNS TO FEE APP AS SO AS YOU OPEN IT. How pathetic. Does that make you feel more like a big company now. There will be plenty free ones to replace this one.  Deleted

B00AB65SVE|5|Great entertainment without an R rating
1582701709|5|I had withdrawn this book from the library and as soon as I began reading, I knew that I had to purchase it.  This is the type of book that one would want to read and re-read, as well as retain as a reference book. Along with the companion book, \\"The Secret Daily Teachings\\" which gives a powerful one page teaching for each day of the year, I also purchased the movie, \\"The Secret.\\"  I now have three sources from which to incorporate this simple, yet profound teaching into my every day life. I read pages from the book each day and when I've reached the end, I begin again. I think that the only way for \\"The Secret\\" to truly work, is to consciously make it an integral part of the psyche, because our inner beliefs guide our lives. I wish for all those who read this book to feel  uplifted, renewed, and with a strength of faith, they didn't know they were capable of feeling.  All the best and God Bless.
B00C2U6G7C|4|For the Zimmer-haters...  please move on...<br /><br />I have always liked Hans Zimmer, and, several of the composers that have worked with him over the years.  As with any composer, etc...  you have things you like and don't like.  That's the way things are.  Nothing is perfect.<br /><br />With that said...  MAN OF STEEL is tons of stylized fun for fans of the composer.  Slick themes, pounding action and rarely a dull moment.  If you are a fan of the Christian Bale BATMAN films...  scored by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer...  this is definitely for you.<br /><br />Great packaging too.<br /><br />A score that will grow on you.
B00GXKVZSW|5|Hannibal Lecter grows on you. Will Graham is awesome! Story lines are disturbing very interesting. Very intriguing show!

B00DVKOYBM|5|Been playing this game for months, now suddenly cannot get access. Game keeps telling me to update, when I try all I get is &#34;do you want to close this game  Yes or No?&#34;. CAN'T WIN!. Very disappointed.
B004LWZW7O|5|In a land where the only thing valuable to people is time, this exciting movie puts the whole appreciation of time into a new perspective, one that rarely anybody may see it from that perspective!
B009IU6BIS|5|Our family has watched it about every year since it came out on video and we never get tired of it.  It has become a holiday tradition in our house.  Still a riot after all these years.
B007I2BZIE|4|Take a minute to think about Rush out of context. They are a trio of old farts that have been peddling largely the same, inaccessible progressive rock/metal sound for thirty-eight-plus years now. So does that make them a band that is fresh out of ideas? Absolutely not -- you should have known better than to think that! Somehow, even with band members that are well into their sixties, they still manage to sound fresh and innovative. And their instrumental prowess still manages to blow minds, even if it isn't QUITE as godly as it was when they recorded, say, \\"2112\\" all the way back in the mid-Seventies. Add to this exceptional musicianship a batch of drummer Neil Peart's most imaginative and inventive lyricism (his lyrics usually adopt a concerted sci-fi feel), and the end result is \\"Clockwork Angels,\\" the nineteenth (!) studio album of the band's influential career, and quite possibly their best effort since 1981's \\"Moving Pictures.\\"<br /><br />Lead single \\"Caravan\\" elegantly pins a catchy, bobbing guitar hook against a bed of deft, technical, warbling bass lines and soaring melodic vocals. It also makes room for one especially memorable chorus, too. But if this song is very good, then the next track, \\"BU2B,\\" is positively great! It is a huge highlight on account of it being easily \\"Clockwork\\"'s heaviest song, and also one of the heaviest tunes of Rush's whole career. It has a weird, proggy intro, sure, but it then storms back with massive, thunderously pounding (and actually quite crushing) riffs and funky, slapped bass lines. The next handful of tracks, however, find the band's rhythm section taking over, with the title cut and \\"Carnies\\" (a raucous romp) adopting an almost Motorhead-worthy, punk-derived bass tone that drives the song forward with more really clever fills and riffs. (But only the former of these two cuts is also highlighted by some more excellent melodic vocals, tasty, harmonic guitar solo work, and a really proggy, unplugged guitar-break, where the acoustic guitars are heard noodling away endlessly.) And \\"The Anarchist\\" is also highlighted by a particularly noteworthy rhythm section, with a bouncy, propulsive drum intro that flows into muscular, bass-driven territory.<br /><br />Frontman Geddy Lee's exceptional bass work also comes into the spotlight on some later tracks. Take, for example, \\"Seven Cities Of Gold,\\" because it marries an excellent bass solo (in its intro) with memorable electric guitar riffs, a crashing drum beat, and memorable vocal patterns. Some strong, jazzy, stop-start bass lines coarse throughout it, too. Elsewhere, \\"Halo Effect,\\" a proggy acoustic ballad (and a fairly brief and compact one at that, as it clocks in at just over the three minute mark), \\"The Wreckers,\\" which features some more colorful acoustic strumming, heavy bass lines, and a really big and memorable, sing-songy chorus, and \\"BU2B2,\\" an 87-second long interlude-type track that finds what sounds like a violin accompanying Geddy's clean, soulful singing, are a few other standouts. But it is \\"Headlong Flight\\" that takes the cake for being the set's pinnacle. It is a surprisingly up-tempo and hard-rocking, nearly seven-and-a-half-minute long epic piece that is highlighted by an excellent (and really deft), four-second long drum solo/fill from Neil, and a totally air-guitar-worthy, shredding solo from Alex.<br /><br />Challenging (both for the band and the listener), lengthy (its total playing time is 66 minutes), brilliantly-written (it almost never adheres to standard verse-chorus-verse structuring), and impeccably performed, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" embodies pretty much everything that progressive music is all about. Therefore, this album just might be the best prog rock/metal release of the year (2012), and it certainly is one heckuva way for a band to begin their fifth decade of existence. Indeed, if this isn't the sound of a band that is aging gracefully, then I don't know what it is!acoustic guitars are heard noodling away endlessly.)

0792101448|5|This is probably my favorite western, and I think it ranks with the greatest westerns of all time.<br />I heard the sequel, \\"Once Upon a Time in the East,\\" about a lost samurai warrior trying to find his home clan, didn't do nearly as well, despite the narration by James Clavell.
B0060MYM7O|5|Very nice

B00J9IH1RO|5|I've used skype for several years. I love to see and talk to my Family that live several states away.
B002BSHWUU|4|Enough has been said about the sound quality and the audio within.  Thumbs up for the box and packaging itself - the gatefold CD holders have top quality photos within and the booklets for each are terrific, held with staples rather than glue that will fall apart after a casual glance.  I like it!
B0071XO8RA|5|The best kind of science fiction does not predict the future, it tells truths about who we are now. Wool touches on so many tidbits of contemporary human existence, but it does so in inventive, sometimes subtle ways. I put it at a very close second to my favorite writer, Ursula LeGuin, and her political novel The Dispossesed. The constraints of living in an underground silo could be an environmental allegory that points to our dangerous exploitation of limited resources. But the book does not stop at such a simplistic connection, it delves into the psychology of conflict, the roots of war, the ambivalence of power, the control of information.<br /><br />I found Wool simply by looking  for highly rated sci-fi after the disappointment of reading The Hunger Games and wish I had found it first. Wool has substance, nuance and relevance far beyond the teen angst and gore of THG. The wholeness of the other world, the imagined culture that can give insight into our own, is complete in Wool. Your suspension of disbelief will be complete after just a few chapters, and you will not want to leave the world of Wool. I especially love the multiple connotations of the titlle- won't spoil it for you though. Read for yourself, you won't regret it! My only regret is that there could be more at the end. Please support this amazing autor so he can give us more!
B0068LYEHA|5|I laughed so hard reading this book! She brings up serious issues in a way that makes you want to think about them differently and deeper. I really enjoyed reading this book (and ever re-read certain excerpts several times!)

B004UID2LC|5|I already downloaded a couple if songs to mp3 and it was simple! The realplayer of android apps except its only for youtube. Try using Astro file manager to search for the folder and find the videos and songs you downloaded and converted. Very much worth the download and would pay for something like this!
B000056HUA|1|My 2005 Acura TL has a DVD-Audio player, so I made an investment in DVD-Audio discs.  The selection was very poor.  I bought about 12 different DVD-Audio discs in 2005, and it should be noted that I did NOT buy any of them from Amazon.  This DVD-Audio version of L.A. Woman is the worst sound I have ever heard.  It sounds like a remix of a mono recording (extremely flat).  And they are asking over a hundred dollars for this?  I would gladly sell mine for half of that, but I have a conscience.  Save your money, and buy the audio-CD version.
B000001GX5|4|Karajan, by far, next to Bernstein is one of the great conductors and his style shimmers through Respighi's beautiful fountains.    This recording is the best by far.
B007PT3QOQ|1|I did love this game, but about every other time I played,  all of the timers on the items I'm supposed to click on reset, to a ridiculous number like 64 or 72 hours before I can collect food or money again. there's nothing I can do in the game right now unless I sell everything and start over, but even that would be a waste because the timers will just reset again and I'll have to buy and sell all over again.
B004QZ9PLU|4|Very good book but not his best.  Did not like the ending but could see it coming.  Look forward to reading more of his books.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Awesome!
B00AKL1XPU|3|I wish it had directions to get you started and a restart. I am new to the games,so maybe I just dont know how to find this info.
B000JVT1U0|4|This is a great movie. The kind of horror that doesn't need special effects and monsters. Just freaky people and freaky environment.    The dvd is the latest and best dvd version of this movie, too bad it looks washed out, but I guess its the best they could do.    Don't judge this movie based on the disgustingly bad remake of Nicholas Cage.
B00005JMAH|1|The director took a chainsaw to the Prisoner of Azkaban novel, and in the style of Leatherface, hacked it up to nothing.<br /><br />This movie fled so far off the path of the book it was frightening.  There were many non-canon moments, and many moments that could have been cut in favor of some more important deleted scenes.  The Knight Bus, while funny, was very different from the usual, and the  Marauders were practically non-existent.<br /><br />If I had only seen the movie and not read the book, then I would've come out confused:<br /><br />Who are the Marauders?  Maybe that'll be answered in a later movie...<br /><br />But the question is answered in book 3, so why not in movie 3?<br /><br />I did not like the Patronus, as this idea of rolling waves of light is not going to work, especially in the future movie adaptions (DA in movie 5, anyone?).<br /><br />There were some non-canon moments that, again, could have been cut in favor of some of the more important canon deleted scenes.<br /><br />The scene where Harry finds out about Sirius being his Godfather... the book did this about a million times better.  And Dan:  You are a good actor, but you need to learn how to fake cry.  You suck at it.  That whole scene was cheesey and badly invisioned.<br /><br />So, why does this movie earn one star?  As a movie alone, it was the best.  So it would, actually, have five stars if HP was not a book series.  It loses 4 of those 5 stars for being the worst movie compared to the books.
B0063IH60K|4|I've always enjoyed this game. I don't love it, but it's cool and helps when I'm bored if I'm not reading or interested in any of my other apps.

B000W7JWUA|5|I bought this game extension for my 19 year son for Christmas and wasn't sure if it was the right thing so I had my 24 year son check it and I did choose the right one.  It was a great price and both sons and their friends love to play this game.  The extension pack goes with the Settlers of Catan game that I also purchased.  It's a great game of strategy.

B002G1YPH0|5|The Hyper 212+ is without a doubt, one of the best coolers for the money on the market. At $29.00 the thing 'hammers' it's competition and dismisses cards costing almost three times as much. The cooler was able to lower my slightly overclocked I7-920@3000MHz to 26 degrees idle and 38 degrees loaded. It is light enough so as not to bend the motherboard and comes with everything needed for installation....including a bolt through kit.
B00IINPXLW|2|I think it's more for younger kids and I'm  a teenager
B0094BB4TW|3|while I do like the app itself it keeps saying I'm not allowed to send a message even though I can when using the Internet everything else works though
1469984202|5|Excellent book, I couldn' t stop reading it. I was very happy to see there was a part 6, wicht I also bought and read straight away.<br /><br />Part 1 of the book  makes you wonder what is happening in this world. The following parts reveal bit by bit in what type of world these people live, each time told by a different person. An excellent read!
B000002QWD|5|This album conjurs up memories of every Christmas of my childhood, and it literally is not Christmas without hearing it at least once. I am 47, but have always loved Bing, ever since my dad and I listened to him years ago. My dad is gone now, but listening to this album brings him back to me again. I love White Christmas because it always sounds new to me, no matter how many times I hear it, and all the songs with the Andrews Sisters are great - instantly sets the time and place when they were recorded. Dated? Yes, it is, but then so am I, and I love these songs more each year! Bing really was the Voice of Christmas.
1451629192|4|I didn't know what to expect when I began reading this memoir. I imagined it would be too much to handle. I didn't really want to read about a diabolical degenerate who kept a girl as his sex slave, but I wanted to know how Jaycee Dugard was able to cope and survive. Despite having to endure so much suffering and torture, Dugard writes about her ordeals in a way that is surprising. Rather than shying away from her traumatic experiences, or glossing them over, she faces them directly. She bravely revisits these painful moments and admits no hatred for her tormentor, Phillip Garrido. In the book, Dugard admits to being shy and nearly equates her shyness with being &quot;weak&quot;. She repeatedly questions her constitution, wishing that she could have handled things better and wonders if she could have escaped when she had the opportunity. The only thing Dugard is guilty of is not giving herself enough credit. She is a remarkable person and as a writer, she's humble, honest, and comprehensive. Once she gets your attention, she'll keep it.
B00FAXJHCY|5|Although I am not a big fan of SF, I loved this book.
B000025XKM|4|This album is pretty good. The singer's voice for whatever reason reminds me of a softer version of Cat Stevens, the music is slower, quieter and melancholy. The arrangements are just him and a guitar, with a bit of piano on the title track. If this came out today, it'd probably be labelled \\"sadcore\\".<br /><br />My only real complaints is that the album is a little short, and I felt there could be a bit more accompaniment. The piano on the title track is nice. That's just a matter of taste I guess.<br /><br />I enjoy this album nonetheless. It's relaxing and I enjoy going for a walk during the evening with this on.
0679805273|5|The book arrived in just a few days and showed up in perfect quality. I love it and read it with my boys all the time.
B00E5Q1LTY|5|Seems like JJ Abrahams has really captured the spirit of Star Trek once again. The stage is set to boldly go where no movie has gone before.
B00K6D1HSK|5|Great Concert.  Only wished I was there.<br />GNR still is amazing.  Definitely recommend.  Sound was great, AXL sounded great.
B00L9B7IKE|4|I definitely though it was interesting never knew who did it
B00KA7JIII|5|I loved echochrome on PlayStation, and this is similar, but has much more detailed scenes...beautifully put together. Now just needs more levels, can't get enough!
B00FAPF5U0|4|Very addicting!
B006ID6NDQ|4|I was so glad to read Edith's story.  It was heartwarming to read of the people who helped her hide in plain sight.  We have a tendency to view history in very black and white terms - and it was interesting for me to walk through her experiences and see the many shades of grey... not everyone was &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34; - sometimes people just &#34;are&#34;.  Definitely worth the time to read!
B00DURGZHW|3|Good movie, but not great.  Some good action but very slow moving.
B00B7FOQCK|5|This is a great item for the price.  This hub is perfect for big external hard drives where speed is required.
B00CXVX1OQ|2|It seemed like a funny concept, but the &#34;tutorial&#34; didn't really give much guidance, and then the game caused my Kindle Fire to freeze up, so the monkeys were punching in slow motion!
B005LAIHY0|4|Love it or hate it, this film has kept people talking ever since it was released last summer. Obviously it's had a polarizing effect and everyone has an opinion, ranging from calling it a masterpiece to calling it one of the worst movies ever made. While I think calling Prometheus a masterpiece is a bit of a stretch, I do think it's a fantastic slice of sci-fi and it reminds me why I love the genre so much in the first place.<br /><br />Countless others have already talked about the stunning cinematography, great performances, and impressive atmosphere so I won't spend time reiterating those elements here. What really makes this film so engrossing is the questions it raises and, in many cases, leaves lingering long after the credits roll. Now this is precisely what so many filmgoers have been irked about and I certainly do not fault anyone for feeling shortchanged. We all expect different things from our films and I can understand why many left this one feeling disappointed. I won't deny that there are some plot holes and questionable moments; in the end they weren't enough to detract from the film, at least for me. Good sci-fi raises big questions and doesn't always answer them. The first time I saw Prometheus I was mesmerized and instantly began asking friends and family if they had seen it and what their interpretations were. After viewing it again I caught so many details that I had missed the first time around and in the process answered some of my own questions while raising a sizable amount of new ones. It's a joy to return to this film in the attempt to see what I've missed and to soak in the experience time and time again.<br /><br />This film is meant to be viewed and discussed. It's designed to to keep you on your toes and to spark your imagination, something that most Hollywood films these days won't do. I find it refreshing to have a film that encourages me to think for myself and explore instead of spoon-feeding everything to me. Prometheus isn't perfect and there are some inconsistencies that I can't ignore, as is the case with most films. Despite that, I'm simply having fun getting lost in the film and hearing what others have to say. That alone is worth the price of admission.ct and there are some inconsistencies that I can't ignore, as is the case with most films.

0440243688|5|After panning book #12 NOTHING TO LOSE, it was excellent to read GONE TOMORROW.  This is one of the best in the series, and the series is over all one of my favorites. Tough guy Jack Reacher is drawn into a complex puzzle with the suicide of Susan Mark, on a subway,someone he didn't even know. A great mystery that keeps you guessing.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B00JAQJMJ0|2|Disappointing on so many levels - I was hoping for something with the style and depth of, say, Robert Altman in \\"Gosford Park\\" or at least \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.\\" Instead, we got a host of fine actors stuck in a madcap morass of endless disjointed scenes and superficial characterizations that would have been been better served/corrected by Mel Brooks or Zucker, Zucker, & Abraham (e.g. Airplane). I laughed, I think, once. Hardly worth the number of Oscar nominations. Meh.
0618918248|4|Clinton Richard Dawkins (born 1941) is an English ethologist and evolutionary biologist, as well as an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford. He has written some of the most creative and challenging defenses of evolutionary theory [e.g., [[ASIN:0393315703 The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design]], [[ASIN:0393316823 Climbing Mount Improbable]]] of anyone other than the late Stephen Jay Gould. He said in the Preface to this 2006 book, \\"I am sure... that there are lots of people out there who have been brought up in some religion or other, are unhappy in it, don't believe it... but just don't realize that leaving is an option. If you are one of them, this book is for you. It is intended to raise consciousness... to the fact that ... You can be an atheist who is happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled.\\" (Pg. 1)<br /><br />After reviewing Einstein's conceptions of God, he comments, \\"I wish that physicists would refrain from using the word God in their specific metaphorical sense. The metaphorical or pantheistic God of the physicists is light years away from the interventionist, miracle-wreaking, thought-reading, sin-punishing, prayer-answering God of the Bible... Deliberately to confuse the two is, in my opinion, an act of intellectual high treason.\\" (Pg. 19) Later, he adds, \\"the deist God is certainly an improvement over the monster of the Bible. Unfortunately it is scarcely more likely that he exists, or ever did.\\" (Pg. 46)<br /><br />He clarifies, \\"I shall define the God Hypothesis more defensibly: there exists a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us. This book will advocate an alternative view: any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.\\" (Pg. 31)<br /><br />He states, \\"This conclusion is so surprising, I'll say it again. If the odds of life originating spontaneously on a planet were a billion to one against, nevertheless that stupefyingly improbable event would still happen on a billion planets. The chance of finding any one of those billion life-bearing planets recalls the proverbial needle in a haystack. But ... any beings capable of looking must necessarily be sitting on one of those prodigiously rare needles before they even start the search.\\" (Pg. 138) He adds, \\"however small the minority of evolution-friendly planets may be, our planet necessarily has to be one of them\\" (Pg. 141), and \\"the present universe has to be one of that minority, because we are in it.\\" (Pg. 145)<br /><br />He also suggests, \\"The key difference between the genuinely extravagant God hypothesis and the apparently extravagant multiverse hypothesis is one of statistical improbability. The multiverse, for all that it is extravagant, is simple. God, or any intelligent, decision-taking, calculating agent, would have to be highly improbable in the very same statistical sense as the entities he is supposed to explain. The multiverse may seem extravagant in sheer NUMBER of universes. But if each one of those universes is simple in its fundamental laws, we are still not postulating anything highly improbable. The very opposite has to be said of any kind of intelligence.\\" (Pg. 148-149)<br /><br />He admits, \\"there's no denying that, from a moral point of view, Jesus is a huge improvement over the cruel ogre of the Old Testament.

B006ZS4QEM|5|I am the nut-job parent that you'll see in some of the other Lego reviews. I grew up with Lego and returned to it when I had kids. Obviously I am terribly partial to Lego, but I'll give you the best review I can so that you can make the decision that is right for your kids. I do not receive free sets or compensation for my Lego reviews.<br /><br />This set arrived in June of 2012 and is part of Lego's wonderful Creator line (more on that below). MSRP is 49.99 (always wise to cross-check with the Lego site). The last time Lego did a beach-themed house was 2008 with set #4996. This year's set is a vast improvement, and though there has been significant price appreciation, the design is much better and it includes a far more interesting selection of hard-to-find bricks, especially the many light-blue bricks. The main build for this set is a modest two-story house with a red roof, stairway, upstairs deck, and plenty of doors and windows. What sets this design apart are the many small details. The beach has a sand castle and breaking waves. The side of the house has an outdoor shower with a hanging towel. There is the obligatory BBQ. The palm tree is all brick built. The second build is what might be called a two-story beach cabana with a little wooden pier. The last design includes two unattached buildings separated by a watercourse and footbridge. One of the buildings looks like a seaside drink/snack stand. All of the designs include the ability to remove roofs in order to gain access to the interior. Except for the seaside stand, none of the buildings have interior features. There is one mini-figure included, along with a surfboard.<br /><br />Play-wise, this set works well with a wide range of Lego's other themes, especially the City and Friends lines (though my kids have no trouble placing Princess Leia and Harry Potter in a Creator house). It is mini-figure size, unlike some of the other Creator sets. And the set makes a great gift because if the child does not like it, they have the ability to make a wide range of other structures. At the very least, it is a good collection of very useful bricks.<br /><br />So far, this is Lego's only Creator house for 2012. Lego had three Creator structures in 2011, two of which I still strongly recommend: 5766 Log Cabin and 5770 Lighthouse. Creator sets are made primarily out of general-use bricks and come with instructions for multiple builds. This is closer to how Lego was when I was a child, and it encourages kids to rebuild the structures either as the other designs or their own. The Creator sets, however, use more ingenious building techniques than what Lego offered decades ago. These are really marvels of miniature design.<br /><br />Finally, at the risk of sounding like a shill for Lego, the Creator section of the Lego website has a nice collection of short videos that feature their own designers explaining advanced building techniques. These videos mesh nicely with this set.<br /><br />Cheers
B007TMON8M|1|After reading another review pointing out that the developer started with 5 fake 5 star reviews, I decided not to download, even though it is the FAOTD.  Who wants something from liars?
B009NG1Q96|4|I am a Bacelor and Bachelorette maniac so after reading the summary I couldn't help myself....I bought the first book, The Selection. BEST.DECISION.EVER.well in a long time at least. :-) I ended up finishing that book and the novella that follows, The Prince, all in one night (hello 3 a.m.) and the next night I read The Elite and the follwing novella, The Guard (hello 3 a.m, we meet again). If you purchase these books with the understanding that they are light and easy reads I don’t think you will be disappointed.

B00005V1Y0|5|The plot of \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" isn't overly complicated, but somehow its director, Baz Luhrmann, managed to make the kind of movie that leaves you smiling, and wanting to watch it again. This film doesn't give you a lot of food for thought, but it is pure unadulterated fun, and that is a lot :)<br /><br />The main character is Scott (Paul Mercurio), a ballroom dancer who is tired of the steps that others taught him, and wants to dance his own steps. Due to that, and to the fact that he starts to do exactly that in a championship without talking about it with his partner, Liz (Gia Carides), she leaves him. For Liz, the matter is simple: she wants to win, and Scott's new steps aren't the way to do so. The president of the Australian Dance Federation, Barry Fife (Bill Hunter), expresses the situation quite well when he says that \\"Well, of course, you can dance any steps you like! But that doesn't mean you'll...win\\".<br /><br />It is after that chaotic and interesting beginning to the film that the try-outs for Scott's new couple begin, the \\"judges\\" being his extremely emotional mother (Pat Thompson) and his ballroom dancing professor (Peter Whitford), both professional ballroom dancers in the past. Unknown to them, though, Scott discovers in Fran (Tara Morice), a frequently overlooked woman who is merely a beginner with lots of spunk, the person who he wants to dance with, even if he has to teach her himself. After all, Fran's motto, \\"A life lived in fear is a life half lived\\", goes well with Scott's philosophy that is dancing that matters, not winning.<br /><br />All in all, I can sincerely say that I loved this movie, and that I deeply regret missing it in 1992, when it was released... Truth to be told, \\"Strictly ballroom\\" isn't overly popular here in Argentina, and it is rather difficult to find a copy to rent. Fortunately, and thanks to the recommendation of a friend and a new videostore, I could watch it today. I enjoyed the story, the music and the great performances given by the actors, as well as the wonderful ending that allowed me to keep on smiling after a while even after finishing the movie. Of course, I highly recommend this movie to you!.<br /><br />Belen Alcatperformances given by the actors, as well as the wonderful ending that allowed me to keep on smiling after a while even after finishing the movie.

B00005R2M3|4|So far so good for Shakira in her first English album. She didn't forget the her pre-Laundry Service fans with four of the 13 songs in Spanish. Most people that try to make a fusion of sounds from different backgrounds end up making a big mess but she is an exception. It starts off with a catchy first track which the Spanish version is the last song. It has sounds from different places; the snare drum rythyms sound like a zydeco song you would hear in a Cajun restaurant, weird. Tere is no better song to first pitch out in public than &quot;Whenever, Wherever-Suerte&quot;. The music video is really great, sexy without being raunchy. The other songs are not as strong as the ones in her Spanish albums but are way stronger than that pop stuff. This album has taken sooo long because Shakira doesn't wasnt to make an English album straight outta ESOL class; but she still needs some improvement. In one song it sounds like she is singing &quot;I'm farting&quot; I forgot which song but it is towards the middle of the disk (Track One). I don't think Shakira will lean towards blubble gum pop material, she won't sell out into that but I think that she had to go down a level market herself to debut into the Top 40 market, be able to have TV spots at TRL and the Talk Show circuit. That part she didn't pull the strings on. What other young women are sucessfully going towards the top, write and compose their own material: TWO: Alicia Keys and Gwen Stefani from No Doubt. Obviously Shakira is heading closer to that direction (Real Musical Independence)than Britney, Mandy, and even Mariah's direction of &quot;Infantile Pop&quot;. Shakira's album is a new beginning for greater things to come.
B0019N8P2W|5|My friend loaned me this set, I'd never seen the show -- the writing is great, there's no laugh track -- and they say music was removed, which for me is a blessing: one can actually catch one's thoughts while enjoying the program.  Enough background music remains so that it's not like animated Antonioni.  20 minute programs, each a gem.  Daria is a great character as is her cohort Jane.  This show is so good, I can't believe MTV produced it!
B00AGOGOLE|3|Havent used this much. What i can tell you is good.
0399157573|3|Medical examiner Kay Scarpetta has an abundance of troubles: she's traumatized after the Newtown, Connecticut school shootings; she's recovering from a bad flu; her head investigator Pete Marino has bailed on her; her FBI profiler husband - Benton Wesley - is on the outs with his boss; and a serial killer seems to be at work in Cambridge, Massachusetts where she lives.<br /><br />As usual in Patricia Cornwell's series, Kay and Benton are in the cross-hairs of self-serving or demented bad guys - and have to contend with them while concurrently chasing criminals. Pete Marino is also true to form, resentful that Kay never fell in love with him and determined to make her life difficult by behaving in a childish, crude, and unpleasant manner. Personally, I've had about enough of Pete Marino and wish that Kay would cut him loose so he'd disappear from future books.<br /><br />Kay's genius niece Lucy is also on hand - and in this book she's behaving a little better than usual - refraining from getting involved with psychopaths and using her IT skills to help the investigation. Lucy, however, is a hard to believe &#34;over-the-top&#34; character: she drives around town in an armored SUV worthy of the Russian mob, flies helicopters, hacks into any computer anywhere, and so on. I liked Lucy much better when she was a youngster in the early Scarpetta books.<br /><br />The plot of the book is fairly straightforward. Kay is determined to help capture a sadistic murderer who apparently killed several people in Washington, D.C. before heading for Massachusetts. Kay is thwarted, however, because the head of the FBI seems to be tampering with the evidence and a large, wealthy, corrupt corporation is also obstructing the investigation. Kay carries on trying to catch the perp, however, and does numerous forensic examinations that are described in great detail. Readers interested in this type of thing will probably like this book.<br /><br />Though this book is a little better than thelast couple of books in the Scarpetta series it isn't as good as the early books. I'd mildly recommend it to mystery fans, a little more if they're huge Scarpetta fans.

B003ZSJ212|4|From someone who actually owns and has seen the Blu ray set here is review...    1.Video quality 4.5 out of 5. - Definitely the best these movies have ever looked. In Empire Strikes Back, you can vividly see the fur on the tauntaun. The special edition additions were blended in much better then with the previous DVD set. I'm not a fan of the Special editions, this set makes it more bare able. The prequels look on par with the original trilogy, however episode 3 is the show stopper. By far the best picture quality of the set.      2. Audio 7 out of 5. - The sound on this set is amazing. I couldn't believe my ears as the Tie's were buzzing past my ears from my home theater.     The only reason I am giving this set 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't include the original theatrical versions. If you're a star wars fan and are on the fence about this set, its definitely an upgrade from the DVD's.

B00BMKH5NW|3|I love Rainbow Rowell's writing, she is very engaging and a wonderful storyteller. Unfortunately, the Nebraska location plays a fairly predominant role here, and I just got sick and tired of the discussion about the crappy Midwest weather and the deadly boring location. Yes, the weather is crappy in Nebraska and there is very little of interest to do there, that's why most people live somewhere else. The bitter cold, the snow, the ice, yes, it's all nasty. Yes, there is nothing in Nebraska besides Lincoln and Omaha. Nebraska's failings just played too central a role in this book. Rainbow, if you hate the weather and the place so much, please choose a different location for your books, and focus on what you do best, creating multidimensional characters with strong personalities and strong, interesting stories.

B000683VI4|5|The notebook is a touching fantastic movie about a love that I find truelly incredible. I have watched it several times and I cry each and every single time. The actors are really good, I am a big fan. <br />A movie to see, unlike any love storie you have seen or heard about!
B00003CX95|3|The thing about Historical movies is that people who watch them sometimes really ARE interested in History. Go figure. And the inattention to History in the name of History seems a good reason to be frustrated with the film.<br />I'm not an expert on the subject, and I think I did learn a few things, and was entertained. The battle scenes are interestingly created even if there are a few romantic inaccuracies like the Irish and Scots not fighting each other. I didn't \\"love the tartans\\" as one reviewer put it, but I'm not sure they were really Tartans. And I did find the scenes of conflict and subjugation by the English soldiers, looking like so many Imperial Roman troops, of the Scots natives looking like any original British (celtic) isle natives, beaten and downtrodden by their masters, very compelling.<br />Patrick MacGoohan is great as the evil king Edward Longshanks. And of course, he's the real reason I got this movie in the first place. (I humbly admit to planning to employ the FF button.) Sophie Marceau, as his daughter-in-law, Princess Isabella, is stunningly beautiful. But if you know anything about her character in History, you know it's not likely she was a lover of Freedom and the masses anymore than her father-in-law was. Does it matter? Well, maybe not to you. And the portrayal of her [homosexual] husband, the future Edward II, is borderline offensive. He's the stereotypically weak and effeminate homosexual, who unlike the butch heterosexual men is actually frightened by the severed head of his relative, and is not good at, uh, fighting. Lets pray Gibson doesn't make a movie about Alexander the Great. The actor playing Robert the Bruce is very good, and there are moments of nice interplay between him and his increasingly scrofulous father who is angling to get his son the throne. But Bruce comes off kind of as a pampered noble in the grip of Machiavellian forces, whereas in actual fact Bruce may have been much rougher. You won't hear the schoolchild story about the Spider Surviving in this film. It's all about Wallace, and Wallace is all about Gibson.<br />There's a documentary about the making of the film on the DVD, which looked like it could have been very interesting--I wanted to hear more about lenses, but after five minutes of Mel is great. Mel is great. Mel is great,\\" and two seconds of \\"You know. William Wallace was a REAL person,\\" I had to stop watching...
B00KWVZ750|5|This puts the a in AWESOME!!!!!! Such a fun game I pay it all the time.<br />Good for long car trips  anything.  Thanks for the new Game
B00A6VYZ8G|5|If you need a nice break from the overuse of CGI in today's action movies, this is your flick. Great classic movie.
B00A9X9TIW|2|Let me start by saying that I would not have be so disappointed in this movie if I didn't so thoroughly enjoy the first three-fourths of it. The problem is that the ending scene is completely nonsensical and it makes me feel cheated, as if the writers ran out of time and decided to just phone in the ending.<br /><br />Great production, great premise, good acting, but an incompetent ending that disappoints as soon as the credits start rolling. If you watch this, be prepared to be let down at the end.<br /><br />[minor spoilers ahead]<br /><br />From the start, I was actually impressed that they defined a loosely coupled connection from past and future realities, which I think is fine if you are honest about it because it gives us a chance to see a movie we haven't already seen before. What really bothers me though is that the kid's mom wouldn't have died in the alternate future because Bruce Willis doesn't kill her in that one - he can't have even been at that farm in his future's alternate past because we clearly see him closing his loop and killing the older him. So then in what possible way is this future better than those two never going to the farm, and in what way has the kids future been altered at all? If I were playing devil's advocate, I could try to make a case that perhaps just meeting the two Joes makes him a better person, but there is no reason for us to believe that given the story told to us. It's much more likely, given what we saw, for us to assume that this is an experience that turns the kid even more dark and morbid than before.<br /><br />It's almost as if the editors changed the ending in post and then added voiceovers to make it looks like that was always going to happen. Really? Ending a circle of violence that isn't a circle and actually hasn't happened at all until now? Come on guys! Your bad writing (or editing) makes waste of an otherwise great movie.

B00AHJL7BK|4|I like this app as a number puzzle. Overall, I like the layout, but the number keys are so close together my fat fingers end up hitting the wrong button just often enough to be a bit annoying (but not enough to make me stop playing).
B00HTK3EZ2|4|I love reading. Understand that this review might be slightly biased because of it.<br /><br />There are some books which grab you by the collar, draw them into you, and wont let you go till you reach the end of the last page. There are others that just trickle along, taking you to a destination that you all know but they take the scenic route keeping you immersed.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling's Casual Vacancy is a curious mix of the bad parts of both these types of books that some how works.<br /><br />I am not a briton, and know little about the intricacies of the parish system or whatever they call it, yet, the book seems to draw you in by giving you a vouyer's eye view of the aftermath of a death.<br /><br />Think of this as an anti-thesis of 'Chronicle of a Death Foretold'. This books is more of a social examination that delves deep, far, and wide into the aftermath of a person's death and the butterfly effect that it causes in the lives of the living. The attention to detail, the shamefulness of schadenfreude is all laid out there is writing that is unobtrusively striking.<br /><br />If you are person who understands that it sometimes takes 120 pages to simply develop the characters in the novel, you will utterly love this book. In fact the seemingly hebetudinous detail is what gives the story so much grip. You are drawn into the community, becoming the unseen spectator of its residents innermost thoughts.<br /><br />And then there is the ending. What an ending. It is happy, it is sad. For me, the ending was just perfect. Just the way you would want a book of this sort to end. Predictable yet strartlingly heteromerphic. This is a book that simply shows the genius that Rowling is as a writer.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read!
0425263908|1|So I was excited to really compare it this book to the ones E.L James has written, and I could not help laughing as I started reading....It is a copy cat of Fifty Shades of Grey!  The first chapter I just thought to myself \\"give it a try, it is only the first chapter, but then by the 2nd. chapter when she writes about a tie, and gray in color I was really disappointing. I will read it, I already bought it, and like my husband said, the author got what she wanted, to sell.  I really don't understand how she even compares it to Fifth Shades, she copied it!!  It lacks originality, it could of being a great book, no wonder there is not much talk about it as Fifty Shades...
B007THA4FI|5|J.K. Rowling is without question an excellent author. Although I must warn you this book is not fantasy, it is realistic fiction. This is not a book that I would consider if you are looking for anything near Harry Potter. This is a book for well read adults.<br /> During the story she does an excellent job of created several round characters, and depending on the readers values they have the opportunity to select their favorite, or least favorite.  Personally my favorite character in the book died quickly, yet was mentioned throughout the book.<br />The main idea of this story is that no one is perfect, which is sometimes a hard message for adults to hear. I believe that is why this book has received so many poor reviews. The book is well written, it will keep you wanting more!

B00H71PHS0|5|All around awesome show!!! Drama for the whole family. I look forward to more seasons thru the years and more character development.
B0000VCZKM|4|My kids love this movie, especially my 4 year old.  She watches clips of it on YouTube and gets to watch the full movie in the car. The only complaint I have is when carol Burnett sings \\"do you want to smoochie my little coochie\\"...not sure if my kids have caught on to that yet, but other than that, I am pleased.
B0094K20FK|5|Awesome!
B00CL68NOG|5|This was a great gem of a film. Seth Rogen sure lucked out to have Barbra as his screen mom. She delivers an Oscar worthy performance within a film that could otherwise have been utterly forgettable.  She really does raise the caliber and content of this film, and even makes Seth look like a better actor than he truly is.  Her performance is heartwarming, nuanced and top-shelf.  it's like an acting master class.  Remember, there are no small parts, only small actors.  Actors with real talent, raise the caliber of every film and every part they play, which is exactly what Babs does here.<br /><br />This is actually a perfect Mother's Day movie.  It's all about a mom who loves her boy to a fault, and knows best, even when it seems like she's downright loony. Very touching.  Buy it for your mom, then sit down and watch it with her.  You'll both love it.
B0013TXA5Y|5|This was an interesting book I. Don't know what else  to say other than that I liked the movie too
B004HO6I2E|5|FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY but pretty raunchy language. Should be child restricted.
B00CV5ZPA2|1|Damn I still bought this album after hearing everybody saying this album was horrible and guess Wht the rumors wasn't rumors the album sucked only two hot tracks new slaves and blood on the leaves
B00DJFIMW6|5|I think this is is amazing!!!!! Though it does take up a lot of gigs, it is dun and it makes you work hard to get new people buy power ups etc...<br />This app always comes out with new updates that are exciting and I can't wait for the new update!!! You should REALLY get this app!!<br /><br />You have to collect bananas (that's the money in the game) to buy new people and get power ups to help you along the way too!!!<br /><br />I would say the only bad part is when you get a new update it takes a long time to load and same thing when you get the app.  The only other bad thing is that it drains your battery pretty fast if it is already low.<br /><br />I love this app and I think you should get it to!!!
0307946711|5|I am so happy my friend recommended we read this book together as part of an impromptu book club comprised solely of the two of us. It worries me to think that had she not suggested it, I may have never pursued it.<br /><br />As a devoted fan of the film, \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" I expected this novel to be along the same lines but fall short of the 1980s rom-com.  Within the first few pages, I realized that despite the basic premise-- one day in the lives of Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew spanning 20 years-- this novel is epic in scale.  The characters are immediately real and and compelling.  As a 25-year-old aspiring writer who has so far failed to figure out life after college, I found myself nodding throughout Part One (their early to mid 20s), and was often blown away by David Nicholls' insights.  Certain observations he makes about how people think and interact were fresh yet universal-- the type of odd quirks that we all do, but never really reflect upon.<br /><br />Although some reviewers said they couldn't fully enjoy this book because they found Dexter obnoxious and irredeemable, I must disagree.  Despite his many flaws and penchant for self-indulgence, Dexter is adeptly humanized by Nicholls; while I was annoyed by Dexter at times, I could still empathize with the character.  Emma was so wonderful and fully fleshed that my friends and I were left to wonder how a male author could possibly write such a genuine character.  Like most women who have read \\"One Day,\\" I could relate to many of Emma's sentiments and situations.  Her enduring kindness and unshakable determination gave me hope that despite setbacks and false starts, you can still \\"change the world, or at least your bit of it.\\"<br /><br />If my review leaves you thinking that \\"One Day\\" is a sappy chick-lit novel, I urge you to read others.  This is a marvelous work of literature with sharp prose, captivating characters and a timeless plot wrapped in a fresh structure.  No review can do it full justice, so do yourself a favor: Read this book!  Don't watch the movie or its trailers until you have finished it!
B00MOG5EXQ|5|Sting keeps getting better!
B002N7P23I|1|The dub on this ruins the feeling of it being horror. Such a waste to rent it.
B00006EXL5|5|this cd is one of my favs. the unique sound and catchy melodies keep me listening.
B00KNWYDU8|5|This game is awsome but i hate those other games when they make it eazy to level up this is a good challenge
B00004TCPJ|2|Some people like this live Rach 3 performance from 1978, because it is so 'full of profound feeling'. For me, though, Horowitz exaggerates everything so much that it becomes almost unbearable. The deluge of wrong notes, a piano that sounds like nail-scratching-blackboard, much unnecessary banging and an uninspired support from Ormandy's NYPhO make for a performance that will not whet everyone's appetite. Also included: a sonata that sounds more like a Horowitz encore than Rachmaninov. Try Ashkenazy/Fistoulari, Andsnes/Berglund or just about anything else for a better 3rd concerto.
B000063JDE|2|Let it first be said that everyone who considers themselves a serious student of film should see \\"Blue Velvet\\" on principle alone-- this review is intended for people who have seen it, and thus contains SPOILERS.    David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet\\" is that rare breed of film: an unquestioned modern masterpiece, upheld by imdb geeks and Entertainment Weekly-pop culture hounds as something truly special. Everybody seems to like it, and everybody's got their own reason. Some see it as allegory, some simply as a living nightmare, some as genuinely effective drama, some as a coming-of-age story.    I've seen \\"Blue Velvet\\" three times now. The first time, I admit a prejudicial point of view-- I wanted to prove Roger Ebert right in his criticism of it, because Ebert was my hero at the time. I was unimpressed. Later, I returned to it after a number of critics upheld it as the genuine article. I'd seen Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway, and loved both of them-- perhaps I was more prepared for Lynchian weirdness this time around. Nope. I was still unimpressed, although I was entranced by the visual look of the film.    Recently, I found myself picking it up again, after seeing Mulholland Drive with an artsy group of friends who were convinced that they could explain everything that happened in it to me, and pretty much did (except for the blue box and the scene with the huge dude who knocks out the   director's wife). With an increased appreciation of Lynch, I returned to what most consider his masterpiece, ironically enough, prejudiced IN ITS FAVOR this time around.     Well, I'm still not impressed. \\"Blue Velvet\\" thinks it's so damn cool and subversive. It thinks it's turning Americana on its head by depicting sexual perversion behind white picket fences. I don't think it's doing anything at all.    Granted, for forty minutes or so, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is compelling. From the opening scene to the discovery of the ear all the way up to  Dennis Hopper's unforgettable apperance and including the dream sequence afterwards, Lynch had me hooked. He seemed at that point to be ready to go for broke, to show us unimaginable horrors, to penetrate through to the darkest aspects of human nature.    Yet something odd happens after the forty minute mark-- the story that we thought was gradually unfolding into something complex and sinister stops unfolding altogether. After forty minutes, we have all the plot we're going to get. We have a woman held in sexual slavery by a drug dealer who has kidnapped her husband and son, we have the naive college kid who tries to help her out, we have the sweet high school girl he's falling in love with, and that's all we have. Those expecting \\"Blue Velvet\\" to \\"go somewhere\\" from this point will be sorely disappointed.     In the end, \\"Blue Velvet\\" goes down an entirely conventional path towards its conclusion. Instead of exploring the Hopper character, Lynch makes him into a campy villain. Instead of exploring the Rosellini character, Lynch makes her into a conventional damsel in distress, longing after her husband and son. Instead of exploring the MacLachlan character, Lynch turns him into an uninteresting do-gooder. The latter choice is particularly odd, given that Lynch has set him up to have his whole world turned upside-down-- yet he heroically takes everything in stride and saves the day.    Most egregious of all is the resolution of the plot, which I've got to assume is intended as a joke on the viewer. After all of Lynch's pretensions about inverting Americana, he gives us a reaffirmation of it, in the form of a conventional ending in which a simple act of violence   restores the natural order of things, the robins make everything better, and, gee, everything's just great! Even though I'm sure this is intended as ironic, I found myself frustrated anyway. If Lynch isn't going to take his art seriously, why should the viewer?    I don't want to seem like I'm making an attack on Lynch, although it may seem that way, asI'm criticizing his most canonized work. Lynch has proven that he is capable of taking himself seriously, and developing stories that go places-- even if they work with a logic that conventional films do not. \\"Blue Velvet,\\" by contrast, goes nowhere and does nothing truly unusual or interesting in the process. I've endeavored to work my way around to enjoying it, but I can't. It simply is not interesting, as a dramatic work, or even as an abstract collection of images.     I would direct those who want to see Lynch at his best to \\"Eraserhead,\\" \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,\\" \\"Lost Highway\\" (my personal favorite), and, in a more conventional vein (well, relatively speaking), \\"Wild at Heart.\\" These are virtuoso films that see the director exploiting the most fearsome resources of cinema to lead his viewers on journeys that begin and end, with point and purpose. They are masterpieces, and no matter what anyone tells you, they make sense if you are willing to do the intellectual heavy-lifting.     Compared to these later works, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is positively forgettable.
B00N9MPAFG|5|It makes me Happy !!!
0805086846|5|heart breaker
B00005JNX0|5|This is a hysterical story about animals getting mistakenly shipped to the wilds of Madagascar. Everything is very old-style cartoony, ie. squash and stretch and just good(but not over done)slap stick. There are tons of jokes that all ages can appreciate and for those of us who are old enough the artwork is based on the \\"Little Golden Book\\" series for children. One of those things that you can watch over and over again. Especially the dance scenes. The lemurs are to die for!
B00688628M|5|An awe inspiring true story that is  a tribute to all those of fought in Europe  in WW II.  Excellent !
B00EHMFC78|5|A good read, interesting and holds your attention till the final page.  Recommend it strongly.
B001BKVWYG|5|After seeing Searching for Sugar Man, I had to have the CD's and was not disappointed. Too bad he had to wait 40 + years to see this kind of success. Excellent
B005IQZB14|5|Great!!!
0738737909|5|I collect decks and this one is beautiful and well printed. the colours are vibrant and images are truly nice and positive energy comes from this deck. this is truly one that someone wants for their collections and is a must have truly !
B00001X590|5|The classic debut from Joe Cocker was an album my sister purchased in 1969. I was only 8 years old, but we played this record to death. The remastered CD is wonderful--never sounded better! However, purists take note: the version of Marjorine on the first CD pressing of With a Little Help from my Friends clocks in at 2:15 (the remaster version is 2:38).  Catalog # is CD 3106. It's definitely a different version of the song. I enjoy the remaster, but I'm holding on to the first pressing!
B00DR0PDNE|4|Would have given 5 stars if there were applications other than just Youtube and Netflix. Should allow third party applications
B002ZTQVBQ|5|I admit, I waited awhile to watch this one, although the kids obviously LOVED it.  They loved it so much, that when I finally committed to watching it, I saw my deaf 3 year old twins both stand to clap when it was beginning.  This is a really sweet movie, beautifully done, with a great story.  Buy it!  And, if you have a blu-ray player, invest in the blu-ray for this one ... It's a keeper!!
0783117523|4|This is the only movie I liked with Angelina Jolie.  Not a big fan.  Her performance was good.  A huge star who had it all and just couldn't stay off the drugs.  It is so sad to say that this still happening today.
B008MG1E4A|5|An easy read.  I loved all the details of how our military works and the dedication it takes to become a Seal!  As I was reading it, I kept thinking how proud I was to be an American!
B00DR0PDNE|4|Works good from Youtube, but the chromecast from a chrome browser has a delay and has lip synch issues.  If the laptop locks the screen, it would pause the video on the TV.  Overall we like it.
0316017930|5|This book takes you on a journey in the past in the life of some successful people in the world, and when you get back  the only thing you can say is WOW. A must read for ages 14 and up .
B002MEW7YY|5|I saw this live with Diana Damrau as Lucia and loved it.  Netrebko is not a tyypical bel-canto soprano for this role, and not as good as Damrau, who was stellar, but I think very effective dramatically.  Beczala is as terrific as always.  Personally, I liked the victorian ghost story presentation.
B0094BB4TW|5|love using facebook for keeping contacts in touch, socializing in general, keeping up with other announcements, and keeping track of favorite company pages!
B007MB5OCE|4|This will be a &#34;mixed&#34; review because on the one hand this book has a lot of clever ideas and dialogue which I thoroughly enjoyed but on the other hand it was way, way, way too long. It felt like it took me forever to finish this book (I did stop reading it twice to read other books though, to be fair) but there were passages that just went on and on that were completely unnecessary and didn't add to the storyline in any way and should have been edited.<br /><br />BUT....clever story about a 100 year old man named Allan who has had a VERY interesting life and along the way met some pretty interesting people. The author combines real life historic figures such as Winston Churchill and Harry Truman and weaves them into whimsical (and fictitious) stories.<br /><br />This book reminded me a lot of Forrest Gump - - Gump just showed up and things happened all around him and to him. I think the character of Allan was much more intelligent but like Gump, he just goes along for the ride and whatever happens, happens.<br /><br />Lots of hapless characters surround him though - some good and some evil - with lots of weird Swedish names to accompany them.<br /><br />A fun read in many ways but I really, really wish the editor had exercised a heavier hand and cut, cut, cut some of the endless dialogue.
0439023491|5|Good trilogy. I enjoyed the writing and imagination.. Just didnt care for the concept of children being put into a violent game
B00FAX6XQC|3|Love the game, but wish it was easier to get glu points.  Maybe use the cash you're rewarded to trade in for points?
B00992CF6W|5|I have played for days straight and can not get off of the game. I still cant figure out how to play with someone else.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Love this. Easy to install and use. Works on most devices.
B005544TRQ|5|How have I missed this great series?  It is witty, fun, and wonderful.  I have been losing sleep watching episode after episode back to back.  Highly recommend it!
B001N3OCV6|5|A number of reviewers have taken this soundtrack to task for its omissions - and, yeah, I was really surprised and disappointed \\"99 Luftballons\\" wasn't included (although only 20-some seconds were used in the film perhaps the filmmakers didn't realise the indelible mark it would leave!).    Still, this being the age of the internet and MP3s it is very easy to make your own 'Complete' Watchmen soundtrack as several websites have already posted the movie's tracklisting.    First off, I bought both soundtracks, the Various Artists and the Tyler Bates Score edition (which, incidentally, is VERY good - has an intensity and darkness that the film's pop tunes overshadow). Also, the CDs come with terrific internal artwork - honestly, worth the price of buying them alone.    For a few extra $s you can pop over to Amazon's MP3 download section and create you own version of the soundtrack: I ripped the original CD into my computer then supplemented it with 6 others featured both in the movie and its trailers, all downloaded from Amazon's MP3 catalogue. I then burned them all onto one 80 minute CD (an * denotes the additional songs which I downloaded).       1) Take a Bow - Muse*  2) The Beginning Is The End Is The Beginning - Smashing Pumpkins*  3) Unforgettable - Nat King Cole  4) The Times They Are a-Changin - Bob Dylan  5) 99 Luftballons - Nena*  6) The Sound Of Silence - Simon & Garfunkel  7) Me And Bobby McGee - Janis Joplin  8) I'm Your Boogie Man - KC & The Sunshine Band  9) You're My Thrill - Billie Holiday  10) Pruit Igoe & Prophecies - Philip Glass  11) Everybody Wants To Rule The World - Tears for Fears*   12) Hallelujah - Leonard Cohen  13) Clyde - Waylon Jennings*  14) All Along The Watchtower - Jimi Hendrix  15) Desolation Row - My Chemical Romance  16) First We Take Manhattan - Leonard Cohen*  17) Pirate Jenny - Nina Simone    Total running time: approx. 76 mins.    I left out \\"Ride Of The Valkyries\\" as this would have taken the running time to 81 mins. Besides,chronologically it falls between Simon & Garfunkel and Janis Joplin - and, dude, that's just wrong! But, seriously, \\"Valkyries\\" completely jars: and, anyway, Apocalypse Now already 'owns' that tune.    Tracks 1) and 2) featured to great effect in the movie's trailers and 16) was the second song used in the end credits. Yes, I know, it was actually the Muzak version of \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\" which was used in the movie - but, really, who wants that?!
B0042U94UQ|5|Great movie
B00KK0PICK|5|This book changed my outlook.  It is not just about cleaning up, but leaves you wondering why you had so much stuff in the first place.  Excellent.
0312932081|5|I was headed on a trip to Indonesia, and I picked out several Science Fiction books from the Library.  My father also lent me Ender's Game.  As coincidence would have it, I had taken out all 3 sequels to Ender's Game, so I got to read all 4.  Ender's Game provided the most memorable  characters and events I have ever read.  I hope that Orson Scott Card  continutes to right Parallel books (ie Ender's Shadow).
B009UX2YAC|5|I like this game because not only is it free but it it similar to despicable me minion rush. It is super fun.
B008JFUN50|1|Ever wonder about The Star Trek comment that in their bright future Poverty no longer exists on earth.  This always appeared as beyond reality as with a population of 18 Billion this little planet would be experiencing some real problems.  From the Movie Elysium, you have to consider if those &#34;Three&#34; Medical Treatment ships, which landed in that slum area are really going to take care of the medical problems of the 18 Billion and growing earth population.<br /><br />This is a political piece!  It's not realistic and ends with &#34;EVERYONE IN THE WORLD having &#34;FREE&#34; Health Care.  Side story lines make the viewer see this as the only &#34;decent&#34; future.  I wonder who pays for it ?  Technology doesn't come free.  Now or in the future.<br /><br />The political posturing of this movie, destroys it at the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Able to broadcast my computer screen onto my TV with any cables. The connection is very good, and the images are very sharp.
B000S1NUM6|1|The album itself is great, but that that sold me was terrible quality and I had to throw it away. I recommend to all intelligent people.
B005ONTD42|5|Held out on buying my own Sphero because this is kinda expensive. My friend had one and he let me use his, but I bought one when they announced more new apps. Just played the Color Grab app - very cool as is, but probably cooler as a drinking game with friends!
B009NW9QE2|5|Both my wife and I enjoyed this movie very much.  It had the feelings of wanting someone to spend Christmas with and how good it made you feel when you could help someone else, even strangers.  We have placed this movie on our &#34;Must Watch @ Christmas&#34; list of movies.
1577314808|5|Echart Tolle's books present universal concepts in easy to understand language.  His discriptions make antient teachings about enlightenment usable to everyone.<br />The Power of Now is a good beginning source.
B000T433CO|5|One of my favorite holiday movies.......your heart will scream, faint, and melt.
0062255657|4|As usual, exceptionally creative.  Read in one, very brief sitting...wanted much more.  Eagerly waiting for another novel.  Gaiman or C. Mieville...tough decision.
B00FG1Q5J8|4|The game is fun but gets rather repetitive early on. You simply do the same things over and over and there never seems to be anything else but fighting. No Diplomacy, no other options but to fight it out it seems. Hopefully the creators learn with this one and make another one but more expansive.
B0055Q5F36|2|if you're looking for rugged, get one that is waterproof and actually fits in your pocket.. this guy is too big, doesn't slide into a pocket, and isn't waterproof
193700788X|5|Thirteenth and the last in the Sookie Stackhouse urban fantasy series revolving around Sookie, a telepath and waitress in a bar.<br /><br />Actually, it's not quite last... After Dead, 13.5, is coming out the end of October 2013. And once you read Dead Ever After, you'll realize that \\"[[ASIN:0425256995 Home Improvement: Undead Edition]]\\", noted as 11.1, is more realistically 13.25.<br /><br />My Take<br />I hesitated to read this story if only because of the diatribes I'd been reading from others, furious at how Harris had ended the series. And it terrified me. My imagination went wild assuming all sorts of horrific scenarios.<br /><br />I have no idea why these people went so nuts. I think Harris ended this beautifully, perfectly.<br /><br />It does have some odd stylistic inclusions that I haven't experienced in this series before. Namely, the start with the unnamed characters that seem to have nothing to do with Sookie until we read further in, only to discover it's all to do with Sookie. All a part of the tidy-up. For that's exactly what Harris is doing. Allowing the major secondary characters to say goodbye, to tell us what's happening in their lives. Clearing up the bad guys and smoothing the way for Sookie's future.<br /><br />Think of it as a curtain call with one of the biggest when so many of Sookie's friends and supporters show up at Sookie's bond hearing in front of Judge Rosoff. Smaller \\"bows\\" come from Aclide and Quinn, Mr. Cataliades and Diantha, Pam is stepping into new shoes, Eric and company's actions which reassure Sookie as to her future choices, and even Sookie's coworkers at the bar help settle the future into an easy peace.<br /><br />It was irritating that Harris kept emphasizing Sam's standoffishness in the first part. Sure, his reasons were good. It's gotta be pretty traumatic. But I think the drama would have been better if Sam had come clean to Sookie and then withdrew again.<br /><br />I'm kinda missing the connection between Sookie's suddenly excessively blooming and fruiting yard with Niall's leaving and closing the door between Faery and our world. Didn't he leave and close things up a few books ago? And only now her yard is going nuts?<br /><br />I'm a little irritated with Sookie in her pushing and pushing at Eric about where she stands with him. No, I do understand her wanting to know, and if she were dealing with another human, I'd be pushing right alongside her. But Sookie knows how unbalanced things are right now with Felipe taking over and wanting to do anything to hurt Eric. Including hurting Sookie. So, why is she pushing so hard?<br /><br />Minor irritations. I am impressed with how content I feel about the end of this series. No, I don't like it ending, but I suspect Harris is ready to move on, just as Sookie is ready for her next move.<br /><br />The Story<br />Sam is lost in the truth of having died. Eric is digging his own grave, metaphorically, yet he does truly love Sookie in his own very pragmatic way. And people from Sookie's past are out for revenge.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Sookie Stackhouseis a telepath and has been excluded from society for it for most of her life. It was only with vampires that she could finally experience something approaching normal. Niall is her fairy great-grandfather. Jason is her happy-go-lucky brother who's also a shifter; he's getting married to Michele. Claude is her fairy cousin who attempted a coup against Niall. And lost. Hunter is Sookie's very young nephew, Hadley's telepathic son who lives with his father, Remy Savoy. Tara is her best friend and married to JB; they have twins. They've just hired Quiana Wong as a babysitter.<br /><br />Technically, she's married, vampire-style, to Eric Northman, the Sheriff of Area Five. The same Eric who is furious with her choice in [[ASIN:0425256383 Deadlocked (Sookie Stackhouse, #12)]]. Pam is Eric's child and second-in-command. Headquarters is Fangtasia. Karin the Slaughterer is another of Eric's children. She'll do anything to protect Eric. Mustapha Khan is a Were and Eric's daytime guy; Warren is his sharpshooting boyfriend.<br /><br />Sam Merlotte owns the bar, well, Sookie is a part owner now, where Sookie waits tables. He's also a shifter able to turn into any animal. They've been friends for years. Bernadette Merlotte is Sam's mom, and she shows up to help.<br /><br />Merlotte's bar staff and customers<br />Kennedy Keyes, the bartender, is with Danny Prideaux (he's Bill's daytime guy and works at a builder's supply), and they're saving up for a house. Antoine is still the cook, and India Unger is one of the barmaids. Holly Cleary is getting married to Hoyt Fortenberry, Jason's best friend. Andrea \\"An\\" Norr is a new hire; she talks a lot, but she's a hard worker. Jane Clementine Bodehouse is a lush who props up a barstool at Merlotte's most nights. She's suing. Marvin is her long-suffering son. Terry Bellefleur is a Vietnam vet who has had a hard time readjusting to civilian life; he works a variety of odd jobs including clean-up at Merlotte's. He met Jimmie over a mutual love of Catahoula dogs.<br /><br />Arlene Fowler, who used to be one of Merlotte's barmaids, is in jail, being held on bail pending her trial in her collusion with the hatemongers who wanted to crucify Sookie. She had been close friends with Sookie and had her babysit her kids, Lisa and Coby, who still want to know why Aunt Sookie hasn't come to see them. The kids are staying with Aunt Chessie while mom's in jail.<br /><br />Alcide Herveaux is the alpha for the werewolf pack in Shreveport; he's seeing Kandace. John Quinn, an events planner, is a weretiger Sookie once dated. Seems his mate, Tijgerin, is doing well in her pregnancy. His sister, Frannie, is doing well also.<br /><br />Bill Compton is Sookie's vampire neighbor and friend across the cemetery. Felipe de Castro is the vampire King of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Nevada. Angie is his girlfriend, and Horst is his second-in-command. Freyda is the vampire Queen of Oklahoma with whom Eric's maker, Appius Livius Ocella, signed a betrothal contract.<br /><br />Desmond Cataliades is a demon lawyer in New Orleans and Sookie's godfather. Diantha is his niece and part fast-talkin' demon. Amelia Broadway, a witch, is a not-quite-so welcome friend of Sookie's; she's got a big mouth and a bad tendency to overshare. She's still with Bob, another witch. Barry Bellboy, a.k.a., Barry Horowitz, the telepath from Texas (see [[ASIN:0441019315 Living Dead in Dallas (Sookie Stackhouse, #2)]]). Delphine Oubre is a touch psychic. I don't understand why no one can tell her their names??<br /><br />The Bon Temps Police Department<br />Detective Andy Bellefleur is Terry's cousin, and he's married to the pregnant Halleigh who is loyal to Sookie. Detective Alcee Beck has a real hard-on to arrest Sookie; Barbara is his wife and the Bon Temps librarian who's terrified. Kevin is behaving like a jerk, Kenya, and Jessie Schneider are fellow cops.<br /><br />Copley Carmichael is Amelia's father; he's in the construction business intending to get rich off the reconstruction of New Orleans after Katrina. Tyrese is a bodyguard who doesn't believe in souls and doesn't think with his head. Gypsy Kidd, a.k.a., Katy Sherboni, is Tyrese's target. Harp Powell is writing a book about Kym Rowe's life. Good luck making it interesting. Beth Osiecki and Jarrell Hilburn are law partners who have done work for Sookie in the past.<br /><br />A devil doing business, collecting souls, paying back debts.

B00D7Z4GQY|1|A little more than half way though the book, I just gave up.  Moriarty seems to be trying to make the story intriguing by adding numerous characters who eventually meet but it just doesn't work.  A lot of the book just isn't very intelligent.
630463949X|4|Great concert performance buy all.  My only negative is the cost of the disc then getting a cheap cardboard box to store it.  Couldn't they splurge and give us a nice plastic box that snaps closed?
B0053O89JM|5|Great Show, wish they have put more into the final season.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Take the time to read & understand this book. It has 3 stories to follow. It makes you think about your life
B007PT3QOQ|5|this game is super cute and very addicting!!! you can play the game without purchasing anything you just have to be patient and need friends.
B00KFOMGZS|5|For being a video game movie, it was great!  A lot of action along with amazing special effects.  The sounds of the cars will get you excited.  A normal TV does not do this movie any justice and I hope they release the 3D version because I watched the 3D in theaters and when they did the inside car shots it felt like you were actually riding in there.  Do not listen to the bad reviews.  People expect perfection out of every movie and that simply is not possible.  For being a video game converted into a movie it deserves every single one of the 5 stars.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Love this show!
B00DR0PDNE|4|Slightly challenging setup but once setup easy to use. More app availablity is needed to make this product fully worthwhile. Great price point.

B0062NAVXA|5|This was a terrific movie, heartbreaking at times but very uplifting movie by the end.  This movie was a great follow-up to Fireproof!!
B005CVWWJY|5|For anyone that loves a really fast paced read, Ready Player One is one of those unique sci-fi/fantasy novels that was very easy to get into from page one.  It is fast paced and you will be hard pressed to put it down.  The main characters of Parzival, Aech, & Arte3mis are well thought out and you can easily find yourself identifying with some of their feelings of excitement, anxiety, and even aloneness as they make their way through the layers of the game to reach the ultimate prize.  The experience in the Oasis is fast paced and brilliantly executed with all the attention to such detail where I felt myself knowing many of the 1980 references and felt immersed in the oasis itself!  I also loved the presence that IOI created where you had once again good versus evil and the race it created in the Oasis. It is easy to fall under the spell of this writer and I have recently heard that Spielberg is interested in directing this book as a movie! I can't wait!!
B008QE9VJI|5|Johnny has done it again
B004I2K4DY|4|A clearly exciting night and a truly enjoyable concert style performance of Les Miserables. Much has been made in the commentary about the miscasting of Nick Jonas, and there is much to be said on that -- though it is also worth noting that Jonas played in Les Miserable's original Broadway run back in 2003, playing Gavroche, so I was willing to cut him a bit of slack. That said, lacking the controlled diaphragm of the rest of the cast made him stand out for his lacks, sadly.    Beyond that, while there was perhaps too much hamminess in some of the emoting, it was in the end an extraordinary production. If you like this musical (or just the music from it), this would be a good choice. If you aren't familiar, the 10th anniversary is probably a better choice as a start.
0060853980|5|I was once told by a friend that anyone who really appreciates an art/media form (books, music, etc) has one thing that they love so much that they're afraid to recommend it, in case other people don't love it as much as they do.<br /><br />For me, this is that book.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I've over sold it for you, but this is my favorite book.  It's probably not the best book ever, and it may not be your favorite.  But it is mine.  For any of you that are fans of Gaiman and Pratchett, this is everything you would hope a collaboration by the two of them would be.
B00ANVX6DY|5|best princess movie.<br />my daughter love this to watch it with her friends
B00G6MW68K|4|Overall, I enjoyed this CD/Blu-Ray combo.  I own most of Muse's albums and saw them live during their North American tour last year.  This time around the producers thankfully stayed away from the jerky camera work which was so prominent in H.A.A.R.P.  Perhaps the pendulum has swung the other way entirely, because the editing is indeed a bit slow, with many and long shots of the audience, as other reviewers have complained.  I personally prefer this over the other extreme and find the video a pleasure to look at.<br /><br />One aspect I'm less than excited about is the soundtrack on the Blu-Ray disc.  I'm sure my system is not perfect -- I'm not the kind of guy who listens to his installation rather than his music -- but the mix on this one is really abonimable.  No matter how I tweaked my settings, I couldn't get the lead vocals to stop sounding like they were recorded by a shotgun mic inside a church.  In addition, the bass sounds very muffled, severely lacking definition and punch.  I compared the disc to a few other live concert recordings I own on DVD/Blu-Ray, and those all sound fine.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a perfectionist when it comes to this kind of thing, but I'd like to be able to actually hear Matt Bellamy sing on a Muse record without feeling the need to tweak the settings on my system.  The stereo track on the CD sounds just fine, so I'm guessing the 5.1 proved too much for Muse's sound engineers.  It's too bad, because the video offers a magnificent visual spectacle, and the music is just solid Muse like we're used to.  All in all this recording captures the energy of the show and the musicians' technical accomplishments pretty well, which is why I'm still giving it four stars.<br /><br />EDIT 2/6/2014: After an extensive online search led me to believe that I'm the only one with this experience, I actually ordered a replacement copy from Amazon.  It was to no avail, unfortunately.  Another reviewer was kind enough to suggest, in the comments, that the LPCM Stereo track on this disc is better than the DTS and Dolby Digital tracks (which is true), but all of them are mediocre at best.  I can easily think of 5 other concert videos that I own which have better sound than this one.  So I stand by my initial review.the LPCM Stereo track on this disc is better than the DTS and Dolby Digital tracks (which is true), but all of them are mediocre at best.

B0095ZMMCK|4|Fast paced, and well written story, grabs your attention from the first page to the last page. Well worth your time.
B00PTB7B34|5|It is like clash of glands but call of duty and advanced technology added in. Let me sum it up in one word AAAAwwwsoooomme
6305161879|5|A Fish Called Wanda may be crude, but it is really a romantic comedy in the old fashioned sense of the word. It contains all the neccesary romance elements: an unlikely couple (Cleese and Curtis); a love triangle (in this case a love hexagon); and just about the right amount of sentiment sprinkled in, But it also posseses a wicked sense of humour the perfectly balances and compliments the romance. In a way, something to please everyone.<BR> The old fashioned whimsy of the tale combined with a sense of the macabre is heightened by the presence of Charles Chichton, one time director of many of the similarily dark Ealing comedies who masterly handles this story of a jewell robbery aftermath, with all it's backstabbing and bed hopping. In fact, Wanda could very much be considered an eighties desendent of Ealing.<BR> The cast is sublime. Cleese gives his usual but still enigmatic stuffy British suit performance as barrister Archie Leach, brilliant in the early scenes where he is stuck in his stale upper class marriage with an uncaring wife and a spoilt daughter. As Leach, defending gangster George (Tom Georgeson) on robbery charges begins an affair with chief defence witness and George's girlfriend Wanda (A gorgeous Jamie Lee Curtis).<BR> Kevin Kline performs a comedy masterclass as the ignorant, philosophy reading, violent tempered Otto, Wanda's &quot;brother&quot;, and he seems to have a problem with any men that show his &quot;sister&quot; too much attention.<BR> But Kline is just pipped to show stealing honours by Michael Palin, as the stuttering, animal loving getaway driver Ken. He's George's best mate, and also fancies Wanda, but thinks Otto is gay... oh, and he has a fish that's also called Wanda, which Otto doesn't like. Confused? You won't be, as this near note-perfect comedy fits together piece by piece as all and sundry double cross each other, before reaching a happy climax.<BR> Delicious in every sense of the word.

B000002HPT|2|After great albums such as 'Images & Words', 'Awake', and the wonderfully composed, 20 minutes long 'A Change Of Seasons', Dream Theater has made their stamp in the Progressive Metal scene. This album has came quite close to be a slap in the face to those who defined Dream Theater as 'the best progressive metal band out there'.<BR>If it's an attempt to create progressive metal, well then, it's a poor attempt. Most of the songs are poorly written and composed. After getting used to epics such as Metropolis pt 1, we are forced to listen to \\"It's all about you not me/It's all about the things/that you're expecting me to be\\"? And the music doesn't top the lyrics, but sort of level with them, which creates dull songs, both lyrically and musically. <BR>Though not all songs are lacking, it still wasn't expected after 'A Change of Seasons'.<BR>Despite the fact that this album is pretty much a disappointment, Dream Theater did 'compensate' us when they've released Metropolis pt 2, but that's another story..
068987474X|1|The review written by Lady Cascadia \\"Sabrina\\" \\"A Romantic yet Eclectic Soul\\" (a couple of rows down this one) is an excellent summary and provides insightfulness that maybe some had not considered.  There are some real men and real women out there who are respectful, kind, caring, considerate people (not at all players).  Recommended instead of this book:  \\"Love Loves\\"  ISBN 0595335241
B00005MP58|4|This is my all time fave movie.  I have a very old VHS copy.  I thought replacing it with a DVD would be nice.  Especially with DVD quality.  However, the picture quality is not what I would expect from a DVD.    I like the new version also done very well, in comparison the older longer one goes into much more detail and some of the characters are just perfect for the part.  A&E has some very well done movies.
B0069UP2PI|4|This is definitely better than the post holiday crush of movies that are currently playing at the movies as I write this. If you take exception to this statement, understand that I saw all the good ones around Christmas and that's why I am here talking Contagion.<br />I actually liked this movie despite the fact that it didn't deal with a personal core story as much as fit was a story about how rapidly really bad diseases spread. It reminded me of one of my kids early books called Gossip. The moral in that book is that a little bird tells a larger member of the animal chain something and the information passed from animal to animal gets larger and changes until it is off the charts.<br />What the viewer sees here is akin to the process of something getting spread around. The disease starts out as a sneaky and inexplicable malady that kills and when it picks up momentum, it becomes a race to identify its source and come up with an antidote and manage its spread.<br />Without much more than the slightest thread that links people to one another and make the viewer feel an emotional investment, it still manages to get the viewer squirming. I'm dealing with a cold right now and I felt myself feeling sicker as I watched this on a cushy couch in the family room. Talk about the power of suggestion or am I a closet hypochondriac? Watching the people from the CDC added to the suspense as well as my anxiety.<br />The acting was good as was the script. Though not a weeper, this movie was effective and good. I enjoyed it, it presented me with things to consider given the current political climate, and I did feel better once things got under control in no small part due to the unrelenting efforts by the CDC. Needless to say the environment was ripe for mob violence and depression and there was plenty of that thrown into the mix.<br />Label this as an effective thriller where the bad guy is disease.
B0074D3CAQ|4|Wonderful! I wanted to join Harold's pilgrimage too!
B005PMNBNG|5|This is one of the best albums I've bought in a long time. 80's synth sounds, difficult to understand lyrics, nostalgia. It's great. Give it a listen.
B003ASLJMW|5|Wonderful film in every way. I saw this movie, no joke, when I was 7 years old. I went with my parents to see this. Looking back on it, the KGB kicking butt, lots of assassinations, plenty of havoc, probably not a Disney flick for kids, but what the heck!  I loved it as a kid!  I went with my parents just to see the MIG!    This movie was made in the Cold War, at the height of it. The funny thing about these Firefox and Red October movies is that they always portray the KGB and the Soviets as being on the cutting edge with the U.S. having to steal or copy or spy on their latest technical achievement. The reality was, despite beating us into outer space, the Soviets were the copycats!  The GRU and KGB gots its tech from Silicon Valley and stealing secrets from us!    Nevertheless, the scenes in the film where Gant (Eastwood) is trying to get through Moscow, in the subway especially, are very much fingernail biters.  The film creates solid tension and the action and intrigue are abundant.    The scenes of Gant stealing the MIG were great and the last part of the film, the chase, was well done for its time.  Warning: if you're looking for top-notch special effects a la Lord of the Rings, think again!  In 1982 at the theatre as a kid I felt like I was in Nirvana!  Now watching the movie, I still ADORE it, but wow the effects....pretty dang thin....It's just important to watch the movie in context of the times and use some imagination and have patience with things of that FX nature.  The \\"think in Russian\\" part? Probably the lamest of the whole film. Oh also, don't watch the altimeter of the MIG! It changes in each scene so drastically that I've read even a category 4 hurricane couldn't change it that much! LOL    Wonderful movie in general. I really loved it then and now.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is the best game ever  very addictive
B00B7XGFO4|3|I do love this love story, but this particular adaptation has flaws.  I think it was a TV movie and the picture quality is so bad, at least on my computer, that it is difficult to watch.  They have also cut some parts of the story that I thought were important to the story line.  If you are a Jane Eyre fan, it is probably worth watching.  I am a George C. Scott fan so that overcomes a lot.  Don't start with high expectations and I think it is okay.
0316035904|5|Very good collection of David Sedaris works around a holiday theme.  Enjoyable commentary on modern holiday life but very sad that much of it is all too true.  If you like Sedaris this is a good holiday read to make you appreciate what you have.

B00FKF0F3C|1|The first two books were like wonderful foreplay... the third... a major case of erectile dysfunction .  Ken Follett has long been one of my favorite authors until this book. His view of society and politics in the US is absurd. Everyone in the southern states are racist, bigots. Conservative politicians are all war mongers. Liberal politicians saviors of foreign policy (thanks so much for the United Nations). I am disappointed that this talented an author would paint with such a broad brush. I could sum up Follett's political views (based on these books) as Socialism great, Communism could be good with some revision, Capitalists of any sort BAD.<br />I can only hope his next books don't delve into political issues at all.<br />One other note... as a Kindle Customer I resented having to purchase the video content as well as the book.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Excellent
B007V693YK|4|Pretty good so far... I've found all the songs I've looking for
0316098329|1|I do not recommend this novel at all.  I bought this book because I saw the positive reviews on Amazon.  I have no idea why this book got positive reviews!  This is like the Jaycee Dugard story from the perspective of a child that uses broken English.  I did not enjoy the way the book was written.  The story was drawn out way too long with a description of how they lived in the shed in the backyard.  I was bored of reading what they did on a daily basis!  Bottom line - I regret having purchased this novel.  I only finished it because I paid for it.
B00MNYTWMI|3|This is truly a free game certainly you can spend money if you are impatient and wish to brag about how fast you finished but I am just fine with waiting until the HOG I want is available.

B005ZOBNOI|4|Sad but wonderful read! It definitely lived up to the hype surrounding it. I loved that even though it is a story about teenagers it is not a typical teen romance novel. I didn't feel like I was losing brain cells as I read. It was a highly intellectual read.

B00BLCHZC2|5|This show would get 4 stars for the wonderful landscapes, detailed historical fiction, and unique narrative. A few episodes in, the bad guy is a little too evil/unbelievable for my taste, so his decisions feel more generated to drive plot than to make sense. The show gets 5 stars because the actors affect pretty genuine Nordic accents, which is far more believable than the usual television trope putting on British accents for all foreigners (I refused to watch Da Vinci's Demons because all of the Italian characters have thick British accents).

B005HF2NHQ|5|Yaaaaaay!!  This is one of my all-time favorite TV dramas!  To those who are skeptical, this stuff is real (variations of this type of &#34;Gift&#34; run in my family!) and the storyline of Allison DuBois is very interesting.  Eventually though, the series starts to show how the demands of Allison's gifts & her work with the DAs office become very hard on Allison's Husband.  You can easily see by late in Season-1, that he is clearly being taken for granted by Allison (he's always getting stuck with the kids & there's often a lack of quality-time between them--which would be hard on any marriage).  This selfishness of Allison's leads to marital problems between them, but fortunately, by the start of Season-2, things improve nicely because Allison finally got the message by the end of Season-1 & started putting her marriage & family in proper perspective again.  While there are times where I felt sorry for Allison's husband in the later part of Season-1, the storylines continuing to revolve around Allison's entire family still keeps the series fresh & realistic, like you're living in the house with them too as you observe their daily interactions with one another.  It's like constantly having an inside look at BOTH Allison's personal life as well as the hard work she does to help those deceased individuals & their loved ones find closure.  I've been anxiously waiting for Amazon Prime to get this for well-over a year now and I'm sooo glad it's finally here!  =D  I watched all 7-seasons & will gladly watch them again on Amazon Prime until I can buy the entire series on DVD!  But I love this show so much, that I'll probably wear out the discs!
B00B2JSRAS|5|I've been reading self help and personal transformation books seriously for about 2 years now. I know why I was drawn to this book (tried to buy it twice because I forgot I had it).  It sums every thing up! Going to re-read and DO!!
B00003CXCT|4|No problems with the quality of the picture. Never before has the original trilogy looked so sharp and crisp. Never before has the sound seemed so rich and layered.    Never really bothered me about the added on CGI bits, except for two main parts:    1) Jabba the Hutt in the first one looks stupid and cartoony. He is supposed to be the most ruthless gangster going, yet Han stands on his tail and Jabba yelps (or whatever he does). They should of not included that part (or added it as a novelty 'extra' on the fourth disc).    2) The new dance scene in Jabba's palace is absurd and cringe-makingly out-of-place. The dark, smoke filled atmosphere is turned into a cartoon dance routine.    I also liked the original end Ewok theme, which was better than the new one. It would of been nice if Lucas had just cleaned the prints up and left it that - or give the fans an option to buy the 'original' films.    Empire Strikes Back, arguably the best of the three (and the six for that matter) remains relatively untouched. The print is cleaned up, dated-special effects errors corrected (transparency in the snowspeeder cock-pits). The only major change is a longer version of Luke versus the Wampa monster - this version is more terrifying for kids, as you see more of the monster eating Luke's transport.    Also, in Empire, the actress (apparently it was a woman with chimpanzee's eyes (superimposed) and Clive Revill's voice) who played the Emperor during the hologram communication is changed to Ian McDiarmid (who makes his first physical appearance in Return of the Jedi). Cloud City is revamped, though it looks a bit to fake and cartoonish compared with the original more ethereal set. Though compared with Star Wars: A New Hope and Return of a Jedi, The Empire Strikes Back escapes much of the `revamp.'    Despite the arguable flaws (some people may disagree and like the CGI Jabba) this box-set is still worth buying, it still feels like Stars Wars from yesteryear...well, most of the time.
B00F8L2VO4|5|Great way to learn a language, has quick lessons and let's you learn through listening, writing and comprehending. Best of all is it is free<br />.
B00BIPMGD0|5|Entertaining!
B007P06DJ0|4|The mastering on this album leaves much to be desired. It is beautifully presented and there are wide gaps of silence between song bands so it resembles an old RCA Victor orange label LP from the 70s. You have to crank up the volume in order to hear the music, which apparently has been mastered at a very low volume in order to preserve dynamic range and avoid compression. They should have realized vinyl COULD have tolerated a louder cutting volume and sill preserve the original dynamic range.. A pity.
0679809015|5|My 1.5 year loves loves this book.....<br />She cant wait to &#34;open&#34; the hidden chambers.<br />Fun book to read! Happy to own it
B0042TV4IW|4|This is a tremendously entertaining series, with compelling story lines and wonderful glimpses into 19th century English country life. While the acting and the costumes are typically excellent, some of the characters are overacted (the Pratt sisters) and the scripting lacks the depth of a series such as Downton Abbey, which is just about the only thing standing between this series and five stars. If it had been an option, I'd have given it four and a half stars!
B000002J09|5|Probably Led Zeppelin's best album, or at least their most flawless performance. Two essential heavy rockers lead off - the swaggering &quot;Black Dog&quot; and catchy &quot;Rock and Roll.&quot; We get some  fine-tuned folk loveliness in &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot; and  &quot;Going to California,&quot; while &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; is  simply the heaviest blues sound ever put to tape. Last but not least let me  mention &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; a song that is stunningly beautiful  and earth-shattering all at once. No rock collection is complete without  this album.
B00C7KXUOE|5|love the show, would recommend to anyone who loves silence of the lambs or the Hannibal movie. Definitely a must
B000HIVO64|5|Beck never dissapoints and this is no exception! awesome album!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Superb
B000006TG7|5|This is the Aussie version of LET THERE BE ROCK, and I think that this is one of the best albums the boys ever made. It has a different cover than the international release and we also have the track CRABSODY IN BLUE which is a killer slow blues song which was replaced by PROBLEM CHILD,another good song, on the international release. CRABSODY is reason enough to give this album 5 stars, but we also have the killer classic songs LET THERE BE ROCK, and WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE. Besides those 3 tracks you wont be dissapointed with GO DOWN, OVERDOSE, BAD BOY BOOGIE, HELL AINT A BAD PLACE TO BE. If you like AC/DC, then I recommend that you buy this version anywhere you can find it. I found mine on ebay, and I love this album. Only album the boys made that is better is HIGHWAY TO HELL.
B00DUGCLY4|4|I like this game
B00FAODMNS|5|I love this case! I had avoided putting a case on my iphone for 2 reasons: 1. iphones are sleek and sexy for a reason. Adding those cases that don't come off just add bulk and take away from the sleekness. 2. Those cases that go on the back don't necessarily protect the phone if it falls on the front. I saw a guy with a case on and the whole front of his screen was shattered. So I had a wallet with a slot for my phone except I was too lazy to keep putting my putting my phone in it. Then the other day my phone fell out my pocket and broke. That convinced me to buy a case.<br /><br />I bought this one because it's cute and doesn't take away from the sleekness of the iphone. It has the cool little tab to push the phone up and it even has a slot for credit cards! Plus the price is really good. Score! I'm completely satisfied with it and I know for a fact if my phone falls while in this case it won't get damaged. I can also just toss it in my purse and not worry about it being scratched. Those people who are complaining that it's too tight (that's what he said! couldn't help it), it does get looser after a little bit.
B00IFMHZ58|2|Huge fan of Veronica Mars, but I found this movie disappointing. Much of the movie just did not make any sense. And that's unfortunate because the series was smart, funny, and had some great whodunits for it. This movie just did not live up to any of that.<br /><br />The movie had an interesting concept, that of Veronica's additiction to solving mysteries, to having to dig under the surface, to the danger; all of those things. In trying to come up with a way to bring her back, the writers cntrived and forced too many other roles.<br /><br />You have Dan Lamb, brother of deceased incompetent and lazy sheriff Don Lamb, with poor Jerry O'Connel trying to imitate Michael Muhney's character. This was completely unnecessary. They could have had Vinnie Van Lower in that role, or some other incompetent sheriff, but trying to recreate the character of Sheriff Lamb in a brother is really amateur and weak.<br /><br />What happened to Wallace? He went from working his butt off to become a mechanical engineer to being a teacher and coach at Netptune High? That just does not ring true for this character.<br /><br />Eli's choice at the end of the movie came out of left field. There was no rhyme nor reason for it. This was a horrible waste of his character. Better to have given a nod to him at the reunion and let his character gracefully bow out.<br /><br />And after 9 years, Dick still has the same haircut?<br /><br />And the thing with Madison? Veronic and Madison just lit into each other like it was another day of high school. That exchange seemed very forced. Do people really fall into old patterns like that at reunions?<br /><br />The whole movie was about forcing the characters to remain in the past. I would have liked to have seen some growth, let some of the characters move on wiht their lives. Sure, acknowlege them, give the fans some insight into what they've done since high school and college, but good grief, let them grow up and move on.<br /><br />Some of the nods to old jokes, little easter egg references seemed delivered in a lazy fashion. The characters might just as well have broken the fourth wall and laid their references lines right at the audience.<br /><br />The movie is not the series. You don't have 15 hours to gradually reveal the whodunit, dig into various relationships and make sidetracks into other intrigues and plot lines. The movie would have been better served had they focused more on the mystery, cut out most of the police corruption nonsense, and written a tighter plot and story. This was just all over the place, with several nonsensical and out of character scenes; trying to cram too much into this movie.
B004SUDPWI|5|Classic!
B00D7Z4GQY|4|I couldn't put the ipad down - had to read it every chance I got.  On the metro was the best times for me.  I loved the ending.  Thanks to Liane Moriarty for this.
6305897786|4|I want to call it an action flick, but the action is pretty restrained. Maybe it could be an apolyptic movie, but it's too secular. Instead, it's what Depp seems to do well: interesting, even exciting, but not very well defined.<br />The plot is straightforward enough: the Mystic Book is out  there, and Depp is tracking it down. He is stalked by agents unknown, death and destruction follow in his path, and I won't spoil the end (not that there are too many credible endings to choose from).<br />This isn't an effects-fest, but Depp holds my interest anyway. He's a lot more believable than most action heroes. For example, his character spends most of his time in libraries, so he's not a physically impressive specimen. Happy to say, he is never called on for feats of superhuman strength. He barely knows which end of a gun to point where - sure enough, his first attempt to act threatening with one fails comically.<br />The one false note was that Depp was always smoking and drinking around the precious books. Smoke if you must, but not where the smoke will settle into the centuries-old paper. Drink all you want, but not where there is the slightest chance of getting even a drop on it. The conservator wannabe in me shuddered every time I saw the movie's disregard for the artifacts.<br />I almost gave it three stars for being an ordinary action movie. I gave it one more star, though, for all the mistakes it doesn't make.
B001UTW7QU|4|It is a show like no other I have seen. It keeps you guessing all the way through, is funny sometimes but not cheesy. I've just started watching but can't wait to see how the plot unfolds.
B00AE9UYJ4|5|Dude once I started the game (I did the street map just to let you know) I felt something like following me it was freaking me out! Plus I saw him over a hill and I just kept on goin' ya know. till came the part were I got so scared because I don't like getting scared even though I need a thrill once in a while. plus slenderman I heard from my camp counselor said it isn't that scary so I got this to find out and its fun BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!<br />  Plus slenderman is always watching.................always...........
B004HO6I4W|5|Great Movie
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I truly enjoyed this book.  John Grisham tells wonderful stories that you don't want to end.  I've read all his books so far.
0394800192|4|This was a very good 'I can read it all by myself beginner book'. I read it to my almost 3 year old granddaughter and we loved it. (Also brought back memories of me learning to read it on my own YEARS ago; with one of my elementary school teachers how her smile and nice ways helped me to love to read!) At times the story is rhyming at other times not so much but that is okay because then the words are repeatative which would make it easier for a beginning reader to read it. Also it's a counting book of the apples the characters have on their heads. So my granddaughter and I had a counting lesson as we read as well! A plus! A timeless classic that has withstood the test of time!
B00QW8TYWO|5|What a fun game!! This is a great way to kill time....I love all the free gifts & redeeming coins for more characters....lots of fun!
B008AK8FHM|1|Changed my understanding  of my purpose in life really is. No fear has any value in my life today. Amen
B00IX9UTLU|4|You will totally fall head over heels in love with Hudson. He is a dominate alpha male, rarely if told no. He meets Alayna &#34;Laynie&#34; at a symposium at Stern College. She is presenting a presentation to a group of businessmen and businesswomen. Hudson sees her and decides he wants her working for him. She doesn't go to the after party and they meet at her place of employment The Sky Launch. He orders a drink she gets it for him. The next night he is back as the owner of the Sky Launch. He criticizes her wardrobe and leaves. He shows back up the next night and asks her to dine with him at the club. She doesn't say yes but she doesn't say no either. Hudson has a proposition for Laynie. Laynie says she has to think about it and get back to him. Laynie has a fight with her brother making her mind up that she is going to take the proposition from Hudson. She calls him and they agree to meet at his office the next day to make arrangements for their agreement.<br /><br />I found Laynie to be a bit of a whiny and needy person. Always second guessing and not trusting Hudson. The not trusting part is due to her past. I found Hudson to be realistic, honest and controlling to a point. He doesn't trust Laynie but that has to deal with his past. He doesn't know it yet but he has fallen in love with her. But he says he is incapable of love. Laynie falls in love with Hudson almost immediately but always asking questions that leads her to arguments with Hudson. Hudson has his issues and faults but he doesn't throw them in Laynies face as much as Laynie throws his in his face. Also Laynie is very secretive holding things back and asking or talking to Hudson about these insecurities.<br /><br />I liked all 3 books in the trilogy and glad that I bought them for the entertainment that they are. Read the trilogy in 2 days a good read.
B000002LOE|3|The reviews seem to either slam this for being too far of a deviation from the norm and too blatantly poppy and saccharine to hailing it for those same reasons. I just like it for what it is. There are some pieces I wonder about, but that is the same with nearly every REM album, even the brilliant Document has songs that don't seem to fit, and so it is on Out of Time.<br /><br />There are plenty of songs I like and amazingly, after repeated plays on radio, Losing My Religion is still that unique hit that doesn't tire out. Maybe it's because it is so lyrically intriguing, I don't know. The only questionable songs I have are Endgame, which sounds like an excessively long intro to Shiny Happy People and, well, Shiny Happy People. I don't mind the song, but it grates on you after a while and seems a bit too much. I'm not analyzing the sarcasm or lack thereof, I just know that it doesn't sound good to me. Speaking of Endgame, I wonder why Peter Buck, a limited albeit melodic guitarist, is so fond of instrumentals on REM recordings. What's the point? Jeff Beck he ain't and even Hendrix eschewed instrumentals for the most part, so why so many from such a modestly talented guitarist? Just a thought.<br /><br />This album is a bit dated and not as in your face as its two preceding brothers nor as jangly and narrow as the band's first three. It is not the sonic overload of Monster. If anything, it is a singular moment in their history where they tried a lot of new ideas and thus loosened the constraints they'd placed on themselves and allowed for the band's future forays. It is a good but not vital part of their catalog.
B000056K04|4|While a departure from what Dave Matthews Band fans are used to, with the previous three studio cuts coming from produce Steve Lillywhite, this new album, &quot;Everyday&quot; has it's charms. Dave on the electric is able to create a new sound the compliments the old quite well. Songs such as &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;The Space Between&quot; bring the old Charlottesville eclectic tunes with a new version of the energy. Many of the tunes are very catchy and I imagine will see a fair amount of radio play. Overall a very nice album, and while it may seem as too foreign to die-hard DMB fans, I imagine it will slowly grow on even the staunch old believers.
0132350882|3|thanks!
B0091REZMW|4|I have also only spent money on this game when I was too impatient to wait for my energy to restore or there was an item I really wanted. My only issue is that I cannot figure out how to beat the bosses and I cannot find that information anywhere. Good graphics and fun game play. Overall worth it!
B00O0MBJPO|4|I had cautions about buying this new release, as I really did NOT care for the first radio release from this cd...Also, usually, when stars try and make a comeback album, at his age and after so long, the album usually fails.<br />I took the &#34;pluge&#34; and bought it anyway...Guess what I do like it! There's alot of the &#34;old Garth&#34; on here that I was hoping for.<br />My favorite song? &#34;She Doesn't Like Boys&#34;...They should have made THAT the first release on radio, and believe me...More &#34;doubtful fans&#34;, would have RUSHED to buy it. I can't get enough of that song, as &#34;we've all been there&#34;...You do have to listen to it 2 times &#34;right in a row&#34; to really &#34;hear&#34; what the songs are saying&#34;...Especially, with all the &#34;background noise(way too loud) in Man against Machine...Once you &#34;hear what the story is, what Garth is saying&#34;, it's a badass song...As in real life, &#34;machines ARE taking away the American workers jobs&#34;...I suggest radio starts releasing more of the &#34;garth&#34; songs from this cd...Or its going to get lost in space...
B00FMJJ064|5|Every song on this album creates an atmosphere that is both peaceful and destructive. Defiantly a good choice in music when working on concept art and animation. Helps a lot in that :D. Love your work!
B0026P3G12|5|Love it!
B005GFPZYK|4|Well told story of an American legend. Kyle is a straight forward guy that some may find offensive. Not for the faint of heart.
B009IRVSVQ|5|Love Bruno Mars. All the songs on this CD are great. If you like Bruno Mars I recommend this CD
B00GGY4R3K|5|I did not know what I was getting into when I watched this DVD.  I am a big fan of Horror movies of all kinds but gore is my favorite.  The gorier the better.  Zombie Holocaust, August Underground, Hostel, bring on the gore!  I am a fan of the indie films as well.  I love what some of the indie horror guy's are doing like Bill Zeebub or the Toe Tag guy's.  With that said I didn't think A Serbian Film (UNCUT) would offer anything too new, hasn't it all been done?  But it did. This movie dropped two HUGE bombs on my psyche.  It took me about a week to get over what I saw.  I know it is only a movie but these two scenes were so well done that it is hard to wipe the visual from my memory.  I was trying to decide how to rate this film and I decided that because of not only these two incredible scenes but the plot, visuals, sound and overall movie quality warranted 5 stars. I honestly have a hard time recommending anyone see this movie but I have to be fair and give it the rating it deserves.
B006FTC6ZC|4|Great film.
0763660531|5|Great children's book
B007W8S2MG|5|I am not really into rpgs, but this game grabs the player into the story. The story is very long,it took me 45 hours on my first play through. I played it on easy because because the combat get hard after the 2nd level. This game is worth the money the story is very interesting and funny, you should give it a try.
B0050QV0RQ|5|this is a simple to jump into throw away Rogan story. its not about the main characters feelings or struggle to come to grips with himself. its a surface level fun dog that you can play for 6 minutes here and there and enjoy. isn't that what a mobile app should be.
B008Y212PI|5|this is a very fun game with pretty pictures. many hours of play.tell your friends to get this game please
0812550706|5|This is an excellent science fiction book. It is the kind of book that really makes you think about things in life, especially towards the end. It makes you wonder, are the things we do really ethical, even if we might have a good reason behind them. But even if you don't want to read the book for the 'thinking', it's a great story, entertaining, and addicting. I couldn't put it down! A must-read for any science fiction reader, or even people who just like to read a good book!
6300248569|1|Definitely the A &amp; E Version of Pride &amp; Predjudice is oustandingly well made.  The scenes, the music and actors performance were exelent.  This BBC version quality is very poor and the acting was mediocre.   Elizabeth Garvie was not a passionate and witty Elizabeth Bennet. And Jane  is suposed to be beautiful and here in this version she was not as  beautiful as she is described in the book. And as for Mr. Darcy in this  version he was wooden, non emotional, no sparkle, requiring no effort at  all in the acting.  The scene were he reveals his feeling to Lizzy was so  boring I turned it off and put on my Pride and Predjudice of A &amp; E.  Definitly Colin Firth is the superior and ideal Mr. Darcy as is the A &amp;  E Version. Elizabeth was witty, charming and passionate about her opinions.  A Masterpiece! Bravo A &amp; E!

0064407667|5|The Bad Beginning, the first book in the &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; can be classifed as clever, dark, and funny. At the beginning of the book when the author says don't keep reading if you hate bad endings he is quite right. First the Baudelaire children get the most horrifying news from Mr. Poe, a guy who can't seem to stop coughing, that their parents had died in a horrible fire. They have a fortune but they learn the unfortunate news that they can't have it until the oldest Violet who is 14 becomes adult age. So their lawyer Mr. Poe takes the three children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to the horrible guardian Count Olaf who will stop at nothing to get their fortune. The three orphans seem defensless against Count Olaf's evil plans as he traps Baby Sunny in the forbidden tower until Violet would marry him. However Count Olaf seems to have underestimated these smart children! <br />This book was really really funny. In many ways it has the humor and darkness of Harry Potter and even more. This is a great start to the books about the Baudlaire orphans but firsthand let me warn you: If you hate unhappy, unfortunate, bad ending stop reading now!
B000FBFN1U|5|This book is amazing. Like all the others in the series A Song of Ice and Fire, George RR Martin has created a setting and characters that delight, frighten and entertain. The action is well done, the dialogue is wonderful and the overall setting of the Seven Kingdoms is amazing.<br /><br />In the pages of this book, and the others in the series, you'll find yourself swept up in the political intrigue, the court formalities and intrigues, and you'll find yourself rooting for your favorite character and hissing your favorite enemy. Definately worth the read.
B00B0U2SEA|5|This is the most extraordinary movie about what happend to the jewish I've ever seen. very interesting and impressive excellent presentation of the genocide.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Green's book speaks to the real issues involved when a loved one has cancer.  Do you live each day as a blessing?  Do you get angry at the basic unfairness of the illness? Do you hold back your feelings to spare your loved ones pain?  How do you relate to others who can't know the reality you live with every day? Green wraps these weighty issues into an adolescent tale of true love, and while the love story is fairly predictable, the book itself takes on questions for which there are no easy answers.
B0050JN88M|4|When I heard about this DVD being readied for release, I couldn't wait for a chance to see what was going to be culled from the archives. As I did not opt for the CD/DVD combo package(I already have both the Japan and Long Beach gigs on disc), I simply ordered the sole DVD. The additional booklet that was included was a nice touch and although some of the footage has already been made available(via History, Hits and Highlights 68-76), I still find the finished product as a satisfying addition to the Mach IV story. Despite the fact that only Jon Lord and Glenn Hughes are featured for the present day recollection of this time period, they are very insightful within their contributions on the impact of Tommy Bolin's presence within the band at that particular time.    There is a bit too much rambling from Hughes about his cocaine addiction towards the middle of the disc, but it does offer basic reasons why the IV lineup was so short lived. There is an interesting anecdote to their trip to Jakarta that I wasn't aware of, and how sinister of a twist that happened to them in losing one of their bodyguards, on top of having difficulty leaving the country itself; pretty spooky stuff there!! I agree that the Rises Over Japan footage is certainly not one of Tommy's better moments, but the remastering of the performance is well done, nonetheless. I enjoy the track by track dissection of Come Taste the Band in the special features section of the disc as it gives more insight into the overall process of recording that album. For serious Purple fans, like myself, this a must have to add to the collection. And its certainly of interest to fans of Tommy Bolin as well. 4 stars
B007FG9LIE|4|It was a great story, I definitely did not see this coming. It kept me going from beginning to the end.
B005K17RU0|5|Works great w fire-have had it for about a month.  No problems great to check other cities and is easier to run than on my aneroid phone.
B00499NHLC|4|Cleverly written, entertaining, and it kept me coming back.  New take on an old classic, and it's beyond enjoyable. Sherlock's character is so well played, and the new take on Watson is a modern-day possibility.  All of it creates such an interesting show.
B00687PWQG|4|I did not care for this film as much as I thought I would.  A little over dramatized and not as historically accurate as I had hoped for.  I guess I was looking for more of a documentary and this was more entertainment than educational.  As long as you go into it for the entertainment value, it is fine.  Well done with an excellent cast.
B008X8RSTM|5|Very useful to travel abroad when mobile internet is unavailable.
B0071XO8RA|5|It has been a long time since I have picked up a book that I didn't want to put down.  I was almost sad at the end. So much more to tell!  Can't wait to start Shift.

B00I6JOD2S|5|The great Grandkids love this movie. Very fun to watch.
0694007099|5|This beautifully illustrated book is about a mouse looking for the right friend. There is not dialogue beyond \\"Do you want to be my friend?\\". The lack of dialogue allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions about what the other animals are saying in response to the mouse. In the end, the mouse finds other mice who emphatically answer \\"yes\\" and they become friends. I do not see any negative aspect to this book, as other reviewers have. In my opinion (as an Elementary School Teacher) this book is not about rejection and bigotry, but is about perseverance and never losing hope. Not everyone will want to be your friend, and that's OK. Keep trying, and you will find people who love you for you! This book is fun. By the way, the ALA adored it.
B004ADH1RI|5|This movie is my childhood. It fed my imagination and made me want more than anything to be a Goonie. This may not be an eloquent review but this is honestly why it gets 5 stars from me.
B00D7Z4GQY|2|It was an ok read.  The beginning is confusing and you really need to give it a while to pick up on the pace/writing of the book but it was just ok.  My book club had a so-so disucussion on it.  I wouldn't recommend it for a book club.
B00003CXA3|5|William Friedkin is really underrated in terms of direction. This movie, The French Connection, has a great documentary feel to it, and is very realistic. Gene Hackman's performance as Popeye Doyle was one of the best roles I've seen in an action movie. Roy Scheider was awesome too. Favorite line from him: Shove it up your a$$. The movie has the best car chase ever, even if most of it was an accident. Friedkin said that there were supposed to be no crashes in that chase. Just near-misses. I think the crashes help the movie. The French Connection is just a great action movie. I loved it.
B00005J79H|4|Scorpions \\"Acoustica\\" is a must-have for any true Scorpions fan. But if you're a first-time Scorpions listener, you probably don't want to pick this up as your first Scorpions CD.<br /><br />The CD is made up of tracks played by the band in a concert in Portugal some time ago and all of the songs are played with accoustic guitars instead of electric. The result is an awesome listening experience as the band does a good job of keeping the crowd energized throughout the entire performance. Some tracks do not come across as effectively as they do in their original recordings, but some come off exceptionally.<br /><br />The band also does a good job on the some of the covers they perform here such as \\"Drive\\" by The Cars and \\"Dust In The Wind\\" by Kansas, which, in my opinion, is the best track on this CD.<br /><br />Pick up this CD if you have additional Scorpions material in your current collection. If you are a first-time listener and are wanting to check out what the Scorpions are all about, you should check out some of their greatest hits compilations first and then come back later to check out this great disc.
B009VIZDLI|5|Loved this book. Very well written, easy to read. A humorous insight into the world of Aspbergers!
B00003CX5P|2|I for one was very dissapointed with this first in the prequel trilogy in the Star Wars saga. <br />To me, \\"Phantom Menace\\" is just a mess of bad script writing, weak acting by the cast, and just mediocre dialog. The storyline was weak and sadly, \\"Phantom Menace\\" damaged my faith in the Star Wars prequel trilogy until \\"Attack Of The Clones\\" came along. <br />The Pod Race scene though in my opinion was extremely awesome and saved \\"Phantom Menace\\" from hitting the bottom of the garbage can. <br />Still though, overall, \\"Phantom Menace\\" in my opinion, adds nothing to the legendary Star Wars saga. <br />Things though got back on track with the vastly superior \\"Attack Of The Clones\\".
B00QWTPCII|5|I must admit... Ever since seeing Thin lizzy back in the early '80's, I thought that nothing could hit this point again. We have had Damn Yankee's which were pretty Damn good. Chickenfoot is of course over the top.  We are talking new, great Hard Rock. Joe Bonamassa. Pretty good, but full of himself. Yeah, Seen him... Walked out. Reno. Chickenfoot, Satriani, Hagar, Anthony... Is Crème de' la' Crème. Then tonight... Still listening... This is over the fu*king top!!! I saw Thin Lizzy in Reno in 2012. Incredible!!! My ears are still ringing! (Thank you Army). I just downloaded this CD and OMFG! it is something beyond special. If I could give this 6 stars, I would. INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!

The only thing is that if you're a kindle fire user, the spell shop and the portal are not going to be available. Team-lava doesn't pay that much attention to the amazon app store. But other than that, the game is awesome and worth all the time.
B000E97HIA|4|Many of the reviews that I have read both professional and non-professional, have been talking about how this is Prince's best album since...whenever, usually saying that this is his best album since his prime in the 80's.  Actually, many \\"professional\\" reviews not only say that this is his best album in many years, but that this is his return to greatness after over a decade of releasing \\"self-indulgent nonsense\\".  Huh?!  Now that's a perfect example of why journalists make for great writers but don't necessarily make for very good music critics.  Yes it's true that Prince has released his fair share of less than stellar albums in the past fifteen years or so: \\"Come\\", \\"New Power Soul\\", \\"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\\"-the worst offender of them all being \\"The Vault...Old Friends for Sale\\". He's also released several uneven albums with their fair share of brilliant moments buried `neath the muck (\\"Diamonds and Pearls\\", \\"Chaos and Disorder\\", \\"Crystal Ball\\").  But it is also true that he has released a number of outstanding albums in the midst of all of those misfires: \\"The Rainbow Children\\", \\"Emancipation\\"-save for a good portion of the 3rd disc :-), \\"The Gold Experience\\"-which is probably the best of the bunch, I can't believe that this album is now out of print?!, and \\"The Love Symbol\\", which is also actually pretty uneven but when it's good, it's so bursting at the seams with inspired ingenuity (Love 2 the 9's, The Morning Papers, 3 Chains O' Gold, etc, etc.) that it still deserves to be in this last category.  This release is more consistent in terms of tone and texture than many of Prince's other recent releases, but the problem is that it is also consistently mediocre.  This album is almost completely devoid of Prince's musical wit and ingenuity, and sounds like it could have been created by just about any contemporary R&B star.  So, to say that there's not much here in terms of innovation would be an extreme understatement.  There are a few pseudo-highlights suchas \\"Love\\", \\"Fury\\", \\"The Dance\\" and the horn section on \\"Get on the Boat\\", but most of this album just sounds like Prince is kind of pointlessly going through the motions.  That would be understandable if you know, he had contractual obligations to fill with Warner Bros or something (ha, ha, ha), but at this stage in his career, he's able to put out music at his own leisure.  Prince seems to have set out here to create a mainstream, conventional R&B album .  He succeeded in that, but unfortunately,  he seems to have left his usual wit and ingenuity at the door while doing so.
B0052UZIFA|5|It r runs perfect on the evo.shift and the evo 3d and it is a really great game. I lived it and will probably replay it at some point just for fun.
B00E5Q1LTY|5|One of my favorite!!!
B002N7K29M|4|Scary... Loved it!
B00PJ5AUCO|5|This game is awesome! I played it and it's really great, but I like the original characters and there are no doors. Evan with these differences this is an amazing game, and a a fascinating prequel to FNaF 1. You really should buy this game!
B000XUBFE2|5|Exposes human suffering during the hardest of times yet still shows dignity of downtrodden and the juxta  fate of all..
B00000273M|4|Now for something different:  The Bangles.  The Bangles were sort of late new wave, which means that they were quickly identified as pop.  Make no mistakes, they are pop.  And what great pop it is:  \\"Eternal Flame\\", which comes with a great music video, \\"Manic Monday\\", \\"Walk Like an Egyptian\\".  Some of their pop is throw-away tunes, but songs like the aforementioned were very good pop indeed.  My favorite Bangles song will always be \\"Eternal Flame\\", which is one of those absolutely incredible songs that will stand out as a great ballad and will be collected on dozens of love CDs, best of the 80s, and on and on.<br />This CD collects the hits they had plus some of their other memorable tunes.  In addition to the aforementioned songs, I also like their cover of \\"Hazy Shade of Winter\\", \\"If She Knew What She Wants\\", \\"Be with You\\", and a blues ballad, \\"Following\\".<br />The music throughout this CD is well-played.  All of the music is very easy to listen to and generally pretty good.  These four ladies really know how to play their instruments.  Though they were an 80s group, there music still sounds fresh, which is somewhat different from a lot of other 80s groups whose music sounds dated.<br />This CD collects the majority of The Bangles best, and once you have this CD you have the essential Bangles.  I would move on to The Bangles released CDs only if you just have to have more of what of the same.
B00I2TV3NO|5|Must see
B00JVZ0DQG|3|OK
B00DMEQP46|5|I'm actually in love with this album, it's hands down my favorite of their work. It's good the first time you listen to it, but it gets better every time after that. Mystery Disease and Introspection are my two favorite songs. It's even better with The Optimizer!
B00BB22GSU|5|Great album, really enjoyed it. If you want to read more, look up a Pitchfork review or listen to the NPR All Songs audio interview with the two main guys.
B001GKJ2DO|1|This was the worst movie that I have ever seen. It was so bad, that it was painful to watch. I can't understand how you can gather some of the best actors on the planet, with some of the best music ever produced, and not be able to come up with even three minutes of watchable film. ?????<br />I could have picked random people off of the street, had them write their own tunes, and film it on a camcorder, and I swear that it would have been more interesting than this unbelievably horrifying excuse for a film. And this has to be said: Anybody who liked this movie must be so insanely starved for entertainment that they'd be amused by watching a plant grow.
B000VLE3GA|5|Excellent
B00005B4GU|5|Wow!  Just finishing my initial run-through to \\"Amnesiac\\", and it is AWESOME!!  I had heard the band was going towards a more guitar based approach, but it really only applies to a few more songs than usual, such as \\"Knives Out\\", and \\"Hunting Bears\\".   The effects and disjointed rhythms that made Kid A so surreal are still there, in spades on virtually every song.  This album is wonderful.  I never had any doubt though.  If you are a fan of good music that doesn't limit itself, and especially of Radiohead, BUY IT.  NOW!
B0064X7FVE|5|This is great...great to have on hand and to know the up to date weather...I highly recommend this app for either phone or tablet
B000XUBFE2|5|Very well done. Couldn't wait to return to it every evening. Wonderful literary technique, using the voice of the angel of death.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This is the best game EVER !!!!!!!!!! I NEED to get the full version !!!!!!!!!!! I think everyone should get this game !!!!!!

B00IWULSTC|5|This show is awe inspiring and helps promote creative thinking like no others. It should inspire young scientists like the Carl Sagen version did in the 80's.<br /><br />Highly Recommend!
B009IU6BIS|5|This is such a classic movie!  I could watch this movie anytime of the year.  The best ever!!!  Watch it, you will laugh throughout the entire movie.  I would highly recommend this movie!
B0067R0APK|5|Very good weather app. Have it on other devices as well.
0425252868|5|Awesome book I hope they make a movie about this.  Very touching story about two soldiers on opposite sides of the war.  I have recommended this book to others who are WWII history buffs,..
B00BUAFBW6|2|Digital kindle version was horrible. No text search. Need to zoom in to read. Should have purchased the physical copy.
B00H3GZMIE|5|Only Liked 2 songs
B000FCKL6G|4|Interesting read of how to influence change on a huge company.  it seems Lou was able to find his trusted circle quick and help with his transformation
B000002UAX|5|This is the Beatles album that has everything on it.  There's hard rock (Back In The USSR, Helter Skelter, Birthday to name a few), ballads (I Will and the STUNNING Julia) pop songs (Savoy Truffle, Bungalow Bill), and pretty much every other style imagineable.  The album isn't without it's faults (Don't Pass Me By is terrible...it's too bad Ringo couldn't have already written It Don't Come Easy and put it on this album instead), but for a double album it is amazing how well it works considering how adventerous it was. John Lennon's voice aches with sincerity on I'm So Tired, while Paul McCartney does some of his best rock'n'roll screaming on this record.  George Harrison, as he often had a way of doing, manages to steal the show with While My Guitar Gently Weeps...a song that gets better every time I hear it. Ringo's drumming is fiery and raw on this album, and his importance to the band is very evident. While Magical Mystery Tour is my personal favorite, this is a damn good, no frills (except at points) testament to the genius of the Beatles as individuals and as a group.
B00TU1JKMO|5|Talkin' about the good times.

B0055SWM08|4|I love the game but will have completed all the levels too quickly. It could use more levels. I love the music too.
0920668372|5|My two year old daughter loves this book so much that she has destroyed two copies of it already.  I would love for it to be in a boardbook made for use by a toddler.  It is a sweet portrayal of parental love which makes a lot more sense to me as a Mother than it did when my mother gave me a copy as a teenager.  For those of you who are creeped out by this, well you are taking this work of fiction a teeny bit too literally.
B000244EMO|5|I saw this movie on the big screen and have loved it ever since. Back in the era when the action movie was king, there were a lot of really good ones and a ton of bad ones. Over the years, it became harder and harder to surprise audiences. But Predator did just that. It starts off as a straighforward action film. Arnie and his crack team sent on a rescue mission. And the first half of the movie is just a great action movie. Then the science-fiction angle is thrown in and the movie becomes something more. I just love this movie! And this set has a lot of great features, interviews and making of stuff to really give a complete overview of a classic film.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|Scott really put thout to this game. He brought back the old gang Scarier than ever . Scott's creative mind, is excellent when it comes to Five Nights at Freddy's 1 and 2. Keep up the good work.👏

0099450259|5|Why spend a few good evenings re-discovering life through the eyes of an autistic boy? The answer to that lies in this intriguing novel. While most fifteen-year-olds spend their time playing basketball or crunching popcorn at the movies, Christopher Boone - our protagonist - prefers cracking difficult maths puzzles and investigating the death of his neighbour's poodle. The latter event eventually leads him on an adventure that forms the bulk of the plot - a discovery of the untold back-story to his parents' troubled marriage.     The main selling point of the book, however, lies not so much in the story per se as having the story rendered through Christopher's eyes. And what he brings is a wholly refreshing perspective on life - from the details he picks out with his unbelievably photographic memory to his manic obsession with order. How many people actually can - or will bother to - remember the number (and colour and size and disposition) of cows they've just seen on a random field? This raises serious questions about the things we `normal people' choose to see and not to see. The language too is perfect - methodical, matter-of-fact and well-suited to the subject matter and how our protagonist relates to it.     A truly refreshing and thought-provoking read.
B007XIC1GI|3|It was interesting to learn about who Marilyn Manson really was. The book revealed things that quite disgusting to me.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|I don't understand why my game is not working correctly it has my farm<br /> and a neighbor's farm mixed in one please help!! I can't get any help from anywhere else and there is no update
B00992CF6W|5|its awesome but they need to make it like the computer version so that you have all of the redstone-machinery.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Crossy Road is one of the best games I have ever played. It has so many characters that you can unlock and it also has the best graphics that fit the game style. Crossy Road also a great game to play when your bored.  Crossy Road is definitely a 5 star game and I highly recommend that you download it.
B004J1DBJI|5|Great for when the straight facts are needed. I use it for demographics, meds, and as a conversion tool. Simple to use and clean appearance
B00B4Z5J92|5|This film documents the history of Sound City studio in California. The site played a major role in the recording of some of the most monumental albums in rock history. Grohl did an amazing job with this film -- check it out!!!!
B000O8OTNC|5|Works like a champ!
B00OV6ATU0|4|very interesting app
B00M60RKW8|5|Loved the book! Had me going to the very end. The plot was like an onion that you slowly wanted to peel off one layer at a time and yet you justed wanted her to snap out of it as fast as possible!
B00004WGBE|5|Gee, this movie was a huge delight!  I love,love,love it!  So glad, I bought it!  I mainly bought it to see James Purefoy, but even if he had not been  in this film, I would have loved it.  Fitzgerald and Stephens were tremendous.  Graves was an alcoholic worm in the most convincing way-creepy indeed.   Purefoy was grand as the supportive older brother and very well dressed as Mr. Lawrence, but not enough screen time and no romantic interest for him-more of a background role than I would have liked for him.  However, again, this film was the best and in many ways upstages Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.  Ironic that Charlotte Bronte did not appreciate this story by her little sister, Anne.  I think the story has a positive female heroine and a nice ending.  In some ways Anne Bronte's story is almost Austenian in its quality.  Buy this movie!
0380788624|5|The tacit, though eventually explained, thesis of the book is that cunning and wit won the WWII, with seminal spin-offs like digital computers, instead of mighty brawn. So, instead of focusing on the figureheads of brawn in WWII, who usually get the most attention (e.g., Hitler, Churchill), these people are only comically peripheral to this book's main focus on a battle of cryptographers and conspiracies to dominate the world's currency/banking. Though it may sound cliche, this gives the reader an entirely refreshing perspective on the events and significance of WWII, in a way that will make seemingly dry topics such as cryptoanalysis seem like wizardry (there is also a quasi-wizard in the book!). Therein lies Stephenson's talent.
B00JJV4QZG|3|This story is not really about 'us,' but about 'him.'  The husband in this case is a boor, who thinks only of himself while claiming to love his wife and son.  He doesn't seem to enjoy anything but always worries about what people are thinking of him.  He complains about being middle class, meanwhile travelling all over Europe, which makes no sense.  He doesn't ever get why people don't like him, but I certainly get it.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved every moment of this beautifully told story.  If you want a story that will stay in your heart and make you see the beauty in the stars, this is it.
B00EMXBDMA|5|The Martian is an excellent read. Essentially Castaway in space - but very well executed.
B0063IH60K|5|easy to read the cards, works well, plenty of options. best solitaire game I've found. - - - - -
B006VFLIYK|4|Good characters, great start. Slowed down, bogged down a little after the middle. Maybe got too complicated. Then picked up and ended well.
B0032UYFA6|5|Absolutely the best TV series I've ever seen! Superb casting, writing and camera work!  I cannot wait to see the remaining episodes.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|Getting new levels is a pain in the a#!.  Only way I could figure it out without spending money was creating a Facebook page.  Kinda lame.
B00006AG9J|2|This is Tangerine Dream's first album.  It is only 36 minutes long.  Sound quality and mix are not very good. <br /> <br />About half of this album is just noise, with the band members just clanking on stuff or making eerie sounds.  Much of it sounds like one of those Halloween albums of spooky sounds. <br /> <br />The other half is some interesting coherent music, with some interesting trade offs between organ, guitar and drums.  The music is really harsh, churning and metallic.  But, the whole thing sounds like a rip-off of earlier Pink Floyd music, specifcially Saucer Full of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma.  (Atom Heart Mother and this album would be released at about the same time, but Pink Floyd had been playing variations on Atom Heart Mother for a couple of years). <br /> <br />This album is nothing like later Tangerine Dream album, where they would soften their sound and move towards more electonica and ambient.
B008WOPHO0|4|Surprisingly good.
B004DH8IK0|5|I really love this album. Every song on this album jives and gets my adrenaline pumping when I start to feel out of focus or drained of energy. It's a really good album to listen to.<br /><br />I don't have anything bad to say about it. If you really like drum and bass music, techno, or another electronica genre. I would recommend this album to you.
B003Y5H5HY|5|- but this was even better. fincher outdoes himself. reznor & finch's soundtrack is amazing. daniel craig & renee russo are great - and mara's performance as lisbeth leaves this fan of the trilogy in anticipation of a coming hornet's nest!
B000QCS8TW|3|I read this book in paperback and am now rereading it on Kindle. What a disgrace! There are multiple typos / conversion problems in every chapter (random format changes i.e. italics or bold). Very distracting. Whichever company converted this to Kindle should start over.
B004L79VUI|5|I'll be brief. Imagine a supergroup that had Robbie Robertson, Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood. They exist on this CD. I've missed this Robbie since Storyville. He knows the best atmospheres where things go down. He must be clairvoyant. Love it.
B003JTHXOK|5|This is by far my favorite book! Twists and turns at every flip of a page! I honestly couldn't put the book down!
B000J233SK|5|When you want to chill out, this is the music you need.  It is very soothing to the soul.
B008JFUS28|4|The plot of &#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34; centers on an ominous cosmic singularity that puts the known realms, including earth, at risk, thanks to some evil elves left over from the darkness at the beginning of time. Remember to pay attention during the introduction, or the movie will be hard to follow.<br /><br />The story picks up where the &#34;Thor&#34; and &#34;Avenger&#34; movies left it, with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in Asgard missing his mortal girl, his mischief-making brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) confined to a dungeon, and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) on earth and about to stumble into a dark and evil substance called aether. Jane's encounter will raise the dark elves from their long slumber, trigger an horrendous invasion of Asgard, and force tough choices on Thor, including having to defy his father and to trust Loki...<br /><br />The special effects are terrific. Asgard is visually stunning as the abode of the Norse gods. The sinister ship of the dark elves looks realistic in space and in London. The fight scenes with the dark elves are thrilling.  The dialogue is quite good.  Jane’s friends (Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard) provide some welcome comic relief). The plot moves along smartly, with many moments of suspense and misdirection, lightened by some wonderful sight gags.<br /><br />&#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34; is good entertainment, especially for those familiar with the Marvel universe of superheroes, and recommended.  Stay through the credits of a hint on the next movie.
B005LAIGOQ|5|Arthur Kipps was dealing with loss, after his wife passed away from childbirth and his employer who wasn't very pleased with his recent responsibilities on the job, sends him out on field work to travel to a remote village to organize a deceased client's paperwork. The young lawyer arrives, but wasn't welcomed with open arms. It was quite obvious that the people in town didn't want him there, but worse yet, there was much more to worry about than just feeling unwanted in the forbidden village. I highly recommend this classic goth story to all thriller and mystery lovers, who enjoy intense suspense throughout with fear and dread instilled from beginning to end. This dark mystery with its silent screams, ghosts and faces in windows will have you biting your nails right up until a shocking ending! The flickering candlelight mood with slamming doors and fog outside will give you that same eerie feeling as if you were viewing 'CAPE FEAR.' The atmosphere is perfect as Daniel Radcliffe gives a superb performance in his role of fright, while something real scary continues to hover over the town. How many children died mysteriously, how many couples were grieving and who was the woman in black, was revenge among the chilling air?
B0092C2X7U|5|its actually good and has replay value... and its free... sadly i bought this game on the Google play store a few days ago. wish I waited! you also have the option of not connecting online in game, so stop griping about it!
B00DPM7TIG|5|The characters were so richly and cleverly woven together  despite their differences.  A beautiful telling of a of sad time in history.  Had trouble putting it down once I got into it.
B005DJREGQ|4|I love it and love all the eye candy.  Matty is such a hottie.  This show is hilarious, but I mean you can't take it to seriously.
B00VRYCGLO|2|Wish the symbols were a little bigger for us OLDER eyes.
B00FAX6XQC|5|This game is excellent.  Many regions to hunt in with increasing challenges.  If you want a virtual hunting experience, I highly recommend this app.
B002VX0A40|5|The dragon is super cute very colorful, durable and best of all my baby loves it! :) it has that crunchy sound in a few places, a little mirror on its tail an it's holding a rattle
B005POK858|5|Ive been waiting for this game to be free forever and it was surely worth it. This RPG sticks to the old traditional style of the pocket sized versions of the final fantasy games. The battle system is very decent and hasn't got boring to me. I highly recommend giving this game a shot u wont be disappointed.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Funny &amp; aggravating but addictive. A bit like the old frogger game. Simplistic graphics, Silly prizes,and characters. It's a shame to lose the characters. Would like to be able to keep prizes, but other than that, it delivers as,described!
B0064X7FVE|5|I have found the weather channel to be quite professional and accurate in their forecasts, plus they have special alerts to give you upto date advance warnings to help you prepare for whatever means of travel for any reason you need.<br />I would suggest this app to anyone.
1451613512|4|Excellent book
B009KY5OGC|5|Grade school history tells us how great our forefathers were, to build this country to what it is now, they left out all the native American blood they had to keep washing off their hands to come out clean in the end.
B005ZOBNOI|5|What a tradgic story, the protagonists live through horror and still laugh! I really enjoyed this book, a true human experience.
B0010V4TZU|5|After watching them on PBS Artist's Den, I just had to buy.  Great album. I also bought their album: &#34;Contra&#34;. Very good!
B00H71PBQ8|5|We started with Season one and got hooked.  Love watching the drama that unfolds with the rich family and the help.
B008XBCJ34|5|Simply amazing
B00454U2QO|5|Great sound & quality! Would recommend
B00AFROVQC|3|Nice young adult story.Set in a mythical kingdom/world it is a combination history/fantasy/science fiction. Pretty predictable.
B00005LC1H|5|If you enjoy John Cleese and English humor, this is a wonderful set. I recalled watching a few shows 25 years ago and then learned I could buy the entire set. My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed the shows -- lots of laughs!!
B00IKZX1ZI|5|It's a great mindless game to play while bored or while waiting for something or while trying to fall asleep
1607066017|5|Saga is an amazing story from Image Comics. A friend of mine suggested it to me and  I fell in love with this story from the first panel.
B008Y78AO4|5|Great action. Flick Tarantino at his best.
B000W8HC8I|5|This book is great! I recommend it to anyone who has seen the movie to see what his real life was like. It's a page tuner and you will have trouble putting it down!
B004WGGQPQ|5|Backgrounds, shapes, colors, textures, stickers, this game has it all and it's simple enough for my two year old to play on his own. If I could only have one app, it'd be this one!
B00I8Q77Y0|4|This game is really fun. But it is a little hard. So it's not the best for little kids. The reason I say that is because it's hard
B0051UP5NQ|3|Bought the pro version because it was on sale and I already had the free version installed. Since I use this primarily for a ppt viewer as notes for teaching, any mobile office app will NEVER be able to compare to a desktop version. With that in mind buying the pro version didn't help my productivity at all, in fact, the pro version slowed me down because it kept allowing me to edit slides when I merely wanted to view them. Also, they make you buy the font package in addition???<br /><br />The pro version does allow you to grab files directly from the cloud, but it doesn't provide access to the Amazon cloud drive (which is disappointing given that I bought this for my kindle from the Amazon app store).<br /><br />All in all, probably not worth the money (and definitely not at full price!)
B00HZ3C4N6|4|Enjoyable to watch. It was suspenseful, the acting and cast was well chosen and the action scenes were legit. It wasn't all that original and blaming Russia for everything is cliche but aside from that I can't see any reason not to watch this if you're into series like Bourne, &c.
B000056HE9|5|such a beautiful story. david niven and loretta young and of course cary grant were fantastic in it as always.I truly loved it.it was a message inside of the movie in the movie. which I thought I got.
B008RA3X5E|5|I'm not into writing reviews on apps or anything online much but this app really does what it's supposed to do and does it well you can count on it to work every time and all the little extras that it has are well thought-out and intuitive.
B000FGGE7C|5|This movie is action packed & thrilling! keeps me on the edge of my seat! Milla does an excellent job as Violet! People need to stop giving bad reviews! This movie has awesome effects & lots of action. Her outfits are cool too! I give this movie 5 stars! One of my favorites!
0345533666|5|It is taking up my time to write this because I'm still reading it.  It is gripping and really makes you feel like you are right there watching this family and the drama.  I will read more of his books when I finish this one.  What a great description, also, of what goes on in schools today.
0790729350|2|Read the other reviews.    I bought the VHS to see if it was better than the DVD. It is! Better video AND sound quality. Warner Home Video did a poor job on the DVD version. It is NOT truly widescreen (as you will see if you buy the VHS). It is more pan-and-scan full screen. You WILL get a better movie by buying the VHS and copying it to DVD.
0739378112|4|The plot was interesting but secondary to the view into Kurt Wallander's mind at 60 years of age.  A wonderfully stark and terrifying end to a fabulous series of books.  You won't forget it.
B000EHSVSC|5|Outstanding, good condition
B004J4WNL2|5|I would recommend this book to anyone who may think they are introverts or who works with them. I would especially recommend it to anyone who has ever felt bad about themselves for not being more social or for being too quiet. Cain points out how society has changed from emphasizing the importance of character to the importance of personality and as a result has overvalued extroverts. But this book reminds readers of the importance of introverts, what their advantages are over extroverts, and how they can use it to their advantage. For example, Cain mentions that although many extroverted CEOs are more famous and often meet the stereotype of what people believe are good leaders, some of the best performing CEOs based on track record have been introverts. Also, she mentions that introverts can be better leaders of highly motivated, competent teams (though extroverts are better at leading teams that need motivation). So this book is useful if you are an introvert learning what your leadership style is but is also for a leader who is charged with leading introverts.
B00OJ92MNQ|5|A fun game that will certainly help while away a rainey afternoon.  I played an early level over ten times until I realized the secret to winning.  After that I whizzed through all 120 levels, and am now going back to achieve 3 stars in each.  The secret, by the way, is to employ bouncing off the walls and always going after the additional powerups.  Eagerly anticipating additional levels.
B0007KLH1Y|5|My four year old received these blocks for his birthday and they haven't been left alone since. They stack amazingly well so we have created so many different things that you cannot do with regular building blocks. I definitely recommend these blocks to anyone looking for a great set of blocks (planks) that allow for a lot of imaginative play - for you and your child.
B003XT60KO|4|Hazlitt takes the work of von Mises and Rothbard and distills it into an easy to digest form that still managed to impart the needed insights.
B00J8CGU64|5|hilarious! Don't watch it with your parents!
B00JVZ0DQG|4|This is a fun game. You get caught up in the strategy of keeping the barn full of the right stuff. The game is addictive. Once you start you cannot put it down.
B0069G5Z9K|4|This game is awesome.I have the second most expensive jet pack and that's the flying v jet pack.It used to be the most expensive at 55,000 coins but then they added the gold plated shark head jet p<br />ack which costs 100,000 coins.Apparently there's a new vehicle,the S.A.M and it didn't give me any notice.
B00DDXJRJG|2|All it does is reduce the other bands, so boosting the bass (or treble) makes it difficult to hear the other parts of the sound.
B007THA4FI|4|This was quite different from what I'd expected and it took a while to figure everything out, then it became nearly impossible to put down.
B005IQZB14|5|Her journey was inspiring- it showed me what one can do!  It also helped me  understand the mindset of over coming addiction.  Her story is a gift
B008AK8FHM|5|I found this book to be so intriguing. Especially because it's written by a doctor. I found it easy and fast to read.
B00AZRBLHO|5|Great book for everyone that want's to know to get the most out of your it organization. Takes agile to new level
B007N8RULO|5|One of my favorite games!
B0033RT7RE|5|Excellent movie and story line. Even though the movie is a little bit older and not in HD, it's superb. Yet another thing the Catholic Church &#34;covers up&#34;
B0090KZDSK|2|Sigh, I miss the day when a book had more then just endless sex scenes. Over and over and over and over.... I got to the end and I scratched my head and had to ponder wtf actually happened in this book.<br /><br />It feels to me like she is writing for the masses rather than writing for herself and her characters journey. Maybe it's just me, but it felt almost over kill and written for the sex hungry, and not the thought provoked.<br /><br />Nothing worse then when characters that are strong, sassy and sexy turn into blubbering lovey dovey mushy crap. This whole crying all the time and blubbering, it's just not the type of thing I want to read.<br /><br />Have a moment of vulnerability and rawness between two characters, but to have them so often almost destroys the sentimentality behind it.<br /><br />To me it felt like a filler book. It also felt like SD needs a really tough editor.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised it was so terrible. I had high hopes and was actually really really looking forward to it. Don't know what happened, but it failed a great author and a great story. Sad really.

B0050DIWFC|3|Interesting foray into the psyche of a teen with a 'family history'. If you enjoy family genre with murder and trials you will enjoy this book. I am split ergo a 2.5 for me. I enjoyed learning about the psychological battery of tests and results but am not particularly a fan of the bottom line. I also felt I'd read parts of this before or heard some of this in the news.
B00DV2D0JC|4|Very interesting game.Great animation  and game play.  My main gripe is the game is too short, I finished it in one night.
0525950079|4|\\"World Without End\\" is epic in its intended scope and its ambition and overall it almost gets away with these pretensions.  Ken Follett is a masterful writer who delivers plenty of interesting prose and characters, drawing skillfully on the book's hugely admired predecessor, \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\"  He is, at times, ill-served by his editors who did not catch blatant repetitions of characters' descriptions and dialogue.  The book progresses through chronological episodes that are generally interesting though, by any standard, can be described as overly formulaic.  The main characters move forward with their lives, but always run into reversals of fortune that block them from reaching their hearts' desires.  This is followed by some return of fortune and then the whole cycle begins again in the next chapter.  Where author Ken Follett is most successful, I think, is in presenting the conflicts of the period--clergy against merchant class; peasants against feudal landowners, etc.  There is a feel of authenticity in these parts of the story.<br />Some reviewers have found fault with the perceived 21st Century sensibilities that Follett is accused of building into this book, but I'm not sure that the criticism is valid.  There are many historical accounts of a less hidebound morality present in the 14th Century where \\"World Without End\\" is set.  Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\" and Bocaccio's \\"Decameron\\" both suggest that the average person was less hung up about sexual activity and variations than the post-Victorians (including our modern selves).  In any event, the sex in this book is not nearly as distracting as the often predictable turns of the plot.<br />I think that this is an entertaining book and worth the time and price as long as the reader does not assume that he/she is taking on another \\"War and Peace.\\"
B006OOHYIC|5|With a healthy dose of creative tweaking, Fallen Tree Games has raised the bar in the logic/puzzle genre. Strangely challenging, yet Zen-like calming effect. Definitely worth the wait!
B00000K19E|5|On top of being a solid action movie, this movie definately brings something new to the world of the sci-fi movie.  After Lucas did it with Star Wars back in the late 70's, the Wachowski brothers do it in the late 90's.  This movie breaks to mold as of late and uses special effects to tell the story and doesn't put them on center stage.<br />The DVD is awesome, with plenty of extras.  A super clean transfer, and great sound.  This moive is a must see.
B0097GVJWQ|5|great!!!!!!!! I love it.<br />I cant put it down.<br />cant wait for part two.<br />wonderful!!<br />I love the storyline. it keeps me intrigue and wanting me to play more.
B00067BBQE|3|Amy Lee has on The Open Door may have improved over the beautiful voice she had on Fallen or Lacuna Coil's singer shows.  Her beautiful alabaster skin, piercing blue eyes, and raven hair may attract almost as many as her vocal talents. <br /> <br />I think The Open Door is a decent album.  However, while I give this album 3 stars, I do not think it compares favorably in bredth or depth to the quality of the music from the 4-5 stars of Fallen.  There are several great songs on Fallen and most of the rest are good are very good for me.  On the Open Door almost half of the songs are just OK and I found only a few to be good. <br /> <br />Amy Lee's voice is still great.  The lyrics can be profound and touching.  They can also be very insightful, especially given her personal trials over the past few years.  However, the music just does not inspire me as much as Fallen.  I have not figured out exactly why, yet, but it seems like I am missing Ben Moody's song-writing skills.  I wonder what these songs would sound like coupled with Amy Lee's voice and lyrics. <br /> <br />Sweet Sacrifice (9/10) - I didn't like the beginning.  However, the song definitely got better about 20 seconds into the song and started rocking around 50 seconds.  This may be my favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />Call Me When You're Sober (8/10) - Good music, good voice, good video (my favorite part is the light laughter and smile at the end).  Not great for me, however. <br /> <br />Weight of the World (7/10) - Good song with a different sounding voice from Amy Lee.  I especially loved the heavy guitar distortion around 1:26 (\\"She's nothing to me\\"). <br /> <br />Lithium (6/10) - Some haunting vocals and lyrics.  (\\"Come to bed.  Don't make me sleep alone\\")  I think teenage listeners and those coming out of troubled relationships will love this, although the music seems a little off to me.  Can anyone pluck a guitar rather than pick? <br /> <br />Cloud Nine (5/10) - I really don't like the start of this song, although it is very different.  Done just a tiny bit differently, this could easily score 8/10 or so for me.  Maybe it will get better with additional listening. <br /> <br />Snow White (3/10) may forever inspire visions of Amy Lee now.  This really can show insights into one or more of her recent relationships.  However, I really dislike the music. <br /> <br />Lacrymosa (6/10) - I liked the choral arrangements, but half of the song my thoughts to the music were... eh. <br /> <br />Like You (6/10) - Just OK at first, but it got better for me. <br /> <br />Lose Control (5/10) - Is it just me or all of these songs starting off weak?  Nice, haunting harmonies later in the song. <br /> <br />The Only One (7/10) - This started off weak and was reminiscent of Fallen.  However, it eventually changed things up and worked for me. <br /> <br />Your Star (4/10) - At first I was wondering if the first 30 seconds of most songs could just be removed.  Unfortunately, I think I might just skip the first half of this song.  I do like how Amy Lee shows her lower range at times here. <br /> <br />All That I'm Living For (6/10) - This song started off strong with an opening chorus, but after the first 20 seconds it just deteriorated for me.   <br /> <br />Good Enough (5/10) - Slow song, but it seemed like a nice orchestral arrangement.  Amy's airy vocals should go well with this, but I just didn't connect with the longest song on the album.
B00F5I344G|5|One of Warren Haynes better endeavors. Great lineup of guest musicians too. If you like listening to jam bands, this is the album.
0553801473|3|I was looking forward so much to this. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed. Even the author, in his afterword, mentioned it was a triple bitch to complete. It sounds very much like he has other projects he's more interested in doing, and isn't dwelling too much on these past ones, maybe even just doing it to keep everybody happy. Unfortunately, too many things left undone from the fourth book, and not much was resolved in this one. And there's WAY too many fans who want to see what happens next. On the plus side, we got to know Tyrion and Danys much better, and a few pieces were put into place and set up for the next book. If there is one...
B00NM7IR26|1|Don't wwaste your time. Horrible movie.
B001F12J0C|4|These movies are wonderful, but to say that they are based on Robert Ludlum's books is ludicrous.  The only thing these movies have in common with the books of the same names is that many of the characters have the same, or similar names.  There is no commonality of plot, or action, and the movies stray farther from the books as the stories and episodes progress.  Good GAWD, Hollywood!!!  Had you called them something else, you would have gained more credit for creativity.
B002JWD6AS|5|Def. a great book.  Clean for teens with sweet young romance.  Enjoyed it all the way through, will recommend to others for sure!
B0099Y2MYK|5|Science fiction is usually my forte but this show has Maggie Smith. Beautifully done in every way - a pleasure to watch.
B00EMXBDMA|5|This is Castaway, Apollo 13, and Gravity, all rolled into one. One of the best little sci fi novels I ever read!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|As a sequel to A Time To Kill, three years later, it's easy to get into the book.<br />Jake, the winning lawyer from before, has a tough job keeping afloat financially after his house has been burned to the ground due to the earlier verdict.<br />His next case is another big one, with obstacles that seem insurmountable after some sudden devious maneuvers by his opposition.<br />It's a good read and worth the wait since his first novel with Jake as his main character.
B00EL8JCGU|3|Walking Dead (which is excellent by the way) sparked this whole Zombie come back.  Zombies were never my favorite.  They are gross and generally decaying.  Replace Brad Pitt with another actor and I think this movie would have been a complete dump. Okay I like Brad.  There were parts of the movie that were okay, but in general long, drawn out and boring. Mireille Enos from (The Killing) is an excellent actor, but in this roll she was written in as this kinda mousy wife that pretty much just waits for Brad to come back to her and the kids in one piece.  Her holding the phone were some excellent scenes (being sarcastic).  She is capable of so much more, but just played a third or fourth or whatever rate actor to Brad.  It was his show and the zombies.  The computer generated kind.  There were just so darned many they could only have done it this way.  Okay.  Basically the story line was good, but it just took way to long to get there.  And then the likely hood of how to defeat them had to do with an enormous (let's say impossible) amount of luck.  Even for a movie the ending was just too much a hit and miss.  I don't want to ruin it, but if the odds in Vegas were that good, everyone would be a winner!
B0091QS88K|4|it is a fun game it gibes my kids something to do while in the car or at the doctors office
B005LJK3AC|1|Horrible Movie.
B00AMBK0X4|1|This is in the top five of worst movies I have ever see in 52 years of movie watching.  Only two Will Ferrell movies were worse than this.  This is 1 1/2 hours of my life I can never get back.  Seth McFarlane- not funny IMO.
B009GQ57ES|5|This CD is fantastic and I love pretty much every single song! I highly recommend this album. Give it a listen!
B004WGGQPQ|5|I really love how versatile this app is and the ease of use. The different mediums and vast array of colors make this very attractive for both my husband and me and our baby. I like that he can get an early start on creative expression with out the mess or trying to eat the paper/pen/paint etc etc. It also nice that you can save each item and send them.
B003HKN52A|4|I had this movie on vhs back in the say when they used to release the elvis collections. i believe it was like five movies per box. Anyway it's been forever since I've seen it as I sold my vhs collection to start buying dvds. The Blu Ray Transfer is great, it seems like they did the best they could with what they had. Though, I will add that it seems with Elvis material they tend to take better care of archival stuff than with others from that time frame. Only drawback with this dvd is that it has no extras. They could have thrown in say a look back on the film including the people who worked on it (who are still with us) commenting on it. But, oh well. It's still Elvis. Some have said that this isn't their favorite performance movie/dvd. I agree with that, however, if put into perspective this isn't really like a live concert. While you get some live performances, that look great on blu ray (I have not seen the recently released dvd version of this so I can't really say what the differences are between the two, I only have my VHS memories) Everything looks great, the sound is great. What I do like (and this is also why I buy special editions of Elvis cd's that include studio chatter/alternate versions) Is that you get a feel of what Elvis was like as a person. You get to see him briefly working in the studio (I always have wondered if they ever extensively recorded him live in the studio and if so if we'll ever see it on dvd) It's always nice to see behind the scenes stuff, as it always gives you a better glimpse into who the man was. Elvis is an Icon, almost a Myth, but it's in scenes that are showcased here, and in other releases that show Elvis the person, his shyness, his humbleness. Though I do wish they included some kind of extras, the book they included was really nice, the blu ray is set up as a book anyway. It's very nice overall, the packaging and pictures were a great add-on. Maybe that was to make up for the lack of dvd extras? I want to own all of elvis's movies. and as much of the other specials as I can. I already own the deluxed edition (3dvds) of the '68 Comeback Special. That I give five stars..totally packed with extras) So I would have bought this dvd regardless, but it's nice that at least with the feature presentation they took time to release a great product. Definitely would recommend it.
B00PRXAP8M|4|impressed by the special effects.  cool!
B00E6Z0THE|3|it's alright
B008FSCNTK|4|We are fans! Nice sound, good vocals, not quite as enjoyable as some of the earlier albums. Four stars on this one.
0804172447|5|Great Read
0385504225|3|Another typical Dan Brown book, this time leading us on a 10 hour tour of Washington DC's monuments and their ancient symbology.  The capital comes to life as Brown describes in exquisite detail the nation's monuments and the artwork found within.  This aspect of the book is always what I have found most fascinating in his novel, and The Lost Symbol did not disappoint in this regard.  Langdon's long time friend and mentor, Peter Soloman, has summoned him to Washington to speak at a conference.  Much to Langdon's suprise, when he arrives he finds that a mysterious man has kidnapped Peter and was actually the one to invite him, but not to speak at a conference, but to solve an ancient mystery in exchange for Peter's life.    I was disappointed a little by Robert Langdon himself. I'm getting a bit tired of his character.  I enjoyed him in Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code, but he has not grown thoughout these stories and he needs a little something extra added to his character if Brown intends to continue the series.    The journey through the capital is fast paced and draws you in, I had a hard time putting the book down when I needed to.  The cast of characters are wonderful, but the suprise twist is was a little too easy to figure out if you paid attention.  While I greatly enjoyed the story, the last 50 pages or so seemed more like an addition to the story after the fact.  They did not quite fit with the rest of the story and kind of ruined the ending for me.
1594489505|5|I don't even know where to begin...this book truly changed my life. What these two women - Marium and Leila - go through is astonishing and heart-wrenching. You really root for them from the get-go and feel their pain as they experience heartache after heartache and disappointment after disappointment. They both experience so many awful things in their lives, separately at first, then together, that you begin to wonder if it will ever get better.   I loved this book, I'd recommend it to anybody and everybody. It'll move your very soul.
B00LG83VNI|1|This is an unreadable translation of what should be a great French classic.  It was apparently translated by machine and has not been edited by a human.  The text is ungrammatical, incorrect, and almost meaningless.  I made a great mistake by ordering it.

B009ZQ8052|4|worth watching... some nice.. chill moments
B00BAXFECK|2|I have read very long books before and haven't wanted them to end.  This had everything in it but the kitchen sink and a lot of horrible characters. Very jumpy and disconnected. Skimmed wordy and excessive descriptions. I don't understand all the hype.<br /><br />DEPRESSING!
B0072OFM28|5|I am the hugest fan of the series and the new spartacus is doing a very good job filling in for Andys tragedy .RIP andy
B00BVYNSLC|5|The first episode got us interested, but by the 2nd episode we were hooked!
B0074ALZ7Q|5|This book grips you from the start! It has all the elements of a true drama; mystery, love, crime, secrets and unforgettable characters. I love gothic novels and an aspect of them I truly love is that the houses these stories are set in are living breathing characters and at times can be more important to the story than any of the characters. As much as I loved this book I do have an issue with books that have no positive female figures. Daphne Du Maurier is certainly not the only author guilty of this but it remains frustrating. The protagonist is such a meek, weak, compliant woman that she isn't even worthy of having a name. Though I must say this could have been done on purpose - to illustrate just how different she is from her rival. Which brings me to Rebecca - Rebecca is a mean, calculating and promiscuous woman. Why is it that women in literature can't be well-rounded, multi-dimensional people. Either they are happy home-makers or sex-crazed villains or whatever other sterotypes the author feels like perpetuating. Now you're probably wondering why I gave this book such a good rating! This book truly deserves it's modern classic status and will have you on the edge of your seat until the very last page.
B002ZG98FU|5|If there were ever a time to love Harrison Ford, it is through his performance in this movie. He's the HARD BOILED EGG of an anchorman with a soft golden yolk heart that he has kept under wraps for years; and it takes the frisky energy and boundless belief of McAdams to finally crack his hard shell and set this Lovable Curmudgeon free. Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton are the reasons that I purchased this DVD. I could watch this movie once a week, and still laugh out loud at their pairing and their exchange of barbed insults. Yes, McAdams is puppy-dog cute & frisky, her love interest is hunky; but it's the repartee, those mild insults both on and off camera that Ford and Keaton sweetly hurl at each other [\\"It's hard to get between you and a sausage...], that spice up this script. Accolades,as well, to superb Jeff Goldblum as the Big Man Upstairs, who carries himself with aplomb; in fact accolades to the Casting Director for each and every character placed in his or her role. The cast is empathetic, believable and lovable. It's Ford and Keaton who make this script fly! Note Ford's catharsis at the end of the film; his sudden realization that, \\"Yes,\\"  he can be a hard-core Anchor Man AND an approachable human at the same time. A great story line; great performances by the entire cast!
B00FEMJF6O|4|I like the characters,graphics ,chat and water everywhere. I wish there were more spaces to sell on the ship but cute game

B000EMGAOY|5|<br />...and Flea and Kiedis aint that bad either. <br /> <br />What I did was not listen to any of or read any reviews before receiving the disc(s) in the mail, being as I'd like to formulate my own opinion. <br /> <br />2+ hours later, I found myself wanting to listen to this music over and over. This to me wasn't one of those recordings that needed to \\"grow on me\\". I liked it instantly. And the more and deeper I listened, the more appreciation I garnered. <br /> <br />These musicians are truly unparalled. Frusciante is at his best in some time. Kiedis' voice is an instrument itself, marvelous. Smith is clean and hard. Flea is Flea...on time, funky and unique. <br /> <br />28 songs too much...? Hardly. It works and it works well. I do think however, that at times pacing is an issue, but I give this a rating of a 5 as nothing in the last couple of years conjures up such an array of emotion. It transfers nicely from an energy ridden diddy to a melodic pop, and in many cases, in a particular song. <br /> <br />Rock, funk, jazz, and Ska are all present. My preconceived notions were...\\"I hope it's not like their last two releases, (though they were very good) and it's not not. It's better. It's obvious the boys spent many an hours honing their skill. <br /> <br />Too many songs to rate, but a couple of standouts are (in no order): <br /> <br />21st Century <br />She Looks To Me <br />Slow Cheetah (reminds me of a summertime drive) <br />Torture Me <br />Readymade (best jam I've heard in some time) <br />C'mon Girl <br />Turn It Again <br /> <br />Listen to this...I mean REALLY listen to this. NOBODY can match their musicianship or degree of uniqueness. There's a depth to this music. There's an obvious maturation that has occured. <br /> <br />Thanks RHCP's for for sharing...the entire CD is great. <br /> <br />
B005CGI4EG|4|never watched this show much, and bought this for an ex a long time ago...i guess he liked it, i probably didn't stick around long enough to care!
B009AP2G26|5|the story lines are getting pretty squishy, but as long as they keep singing with all the talented<br />kids and keep bringing back the oldies once in a while..I'll keep watching just to hear the songs!!
B002BBJ52U|3|I am a rom-com fan...but this was no Love Actually...there were quite a few mediocre stories taking place - none of them were very interesting and the acting was mediocre as well. It's somewhat entertaining, but in a free sorta-way.

B005LAII4E|5|Good special effects and a fast paced story line keep this sequel moving in the right direction. Dwayne Johnson has established himself as a fine action actor.
B003B13QQU|3|Goldfrapp's Head First advances from the late 70's electronic and ambient experimental period to the early 80's when everyone with access to a synthesizer was trying to break into music.  While Allison's Goldfrapp's alternately sultry and ethereal voice elevates this from the average 80's reincarnation, Head First is nowhere as deep as Felt Mountain, as sexy as Black Cherry, as danceable as Supernature or as relaxed as Seventh Tree.  Its just good retro pop music.  Better than most, but not up to the high standards set by Goldfrapp's earlier albums.
B00DFFHUUA|4|What you expect from a film like this.  It's based on a toy, after all ... all over the top fun!

B000FBFN1U|4|A good read.  Just like the others.  Several nice unexpected plot twists.
B000002H3E|4|This 1985 effort found Dokken expanding into more radio friendly areas without sacrificing the quality of their music.The high marks are as always George Lynch's phenomenal guitar attack,Don Dokken's voice,while Pilson and  Brown'rhytm section is as tight as it can get.Every song on this album  counts-an instant metal classic!
1608198065|5|If you have ever lived in Brooklyn, NY for any length of time, you know these people. This is a very humorous and touching handling of a difficult process in families.
B00FJ2YTLK|5|So well written and it ended so lovely, but I can't help feeling that there was a lot more to say.  A lot went down in the last few chapters of the book and it felt a little rushed.  I love the characters, but the author built a lot of political background into the story as well.  I don't feel like that was really resolved.  Would love to see the story through to a little deeper place.
B003JTHXOK|5|This book was amazing and I didn't want to finish reading it when I got towards the end because then it's over and couldn't read it for the first time ever again ha

B0043ZDU1E|5|Loved this CD. If you are a Loreena McKennitt fan, then you'll get exactly what you expect from her. Beautiful music. This is a more &#34;laid back&#34; CD than some of her others, but that suits me just fine. Perfect for a late evening or while relaxing, reading, working. Beautiful songs, beautifully performed.  What more could you want?
B00L9B7IKE|4|Loved all the plot twists and turns and her use of point of view to tell the story. Fantastic read.
B00HDMMISA|5|Well written and engaging. I truly couldn't predict all the turns in this book. So far the only one I've read from this author and only because the book info drew me in. I don't typically read this kind of book. I prefer fantasy and mystery. This was a welcomed change.
B0000DIXN7|5|Upon listening to my copy of \\"Frank\\", several of my friends have made comparisons of Amy Winehouse's debut to other artists from Lauryn Hill & Erykah Badu to Billie Holiday & Josephine Baker. Sure, I can see where such comparisons are birthed, but Amy's first project is solidly unique.<br />A monotoned, jazzed-up voice syrups over cuts like \\"Stronger Than Me\\" & \\"Know You Now\\", while range & depth pervade \\"Take The Box\\" & \\"Love Is Blind\\". The music itself is eclectic: the reggae-tinged turn of her cover of \\"Moody's Mood For Love\\" & the hip-hop inspired \\"In My Bed\\" provide variety among the generally subdued tone of the album. But, for me, the ace in the hole is Amy's lyrics. She implements a slew of literary devices throughout, prompting multiple listens to catch all of the latent references.<br />An accomplished player, a strong vocalist, and an inspired writer: Amy Winehouse is in a class by herself - who cares if she is a bit boy-crazy?? Most 19-year-old girls are...

0930289528|5|In anticipation of the movie, I decided to read V for Vendetta. I'm not sure why I didn't read it before because Watchmen and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen are two of my favorite comics of all time. Alan Moore, for some odd reason, isn't the first author to leap into my head when I'm thinking of a comic to read. However, every time I read him, I love his work.<br /><br />V is no different. Much older than Watchmen and League, it's still good. I'll admit (and Alan admits this to so don't harp on me about it) that's it's not as good in the beginning as it is at the end. Some of the characters are a little unrealized and V is just sort-of inaccessible as a character. But as the series progresses and the story gets bigger than just the killing of the people at the settlement site, everything gets better! The writing gets tighter, the characters more realized, the tension almost palatable, and the plot barreling down to the tracks to the finish!<br /><br />Lloyd's artwork is deceiving. At first, it seems simple, kind-of like David Mazzucchelli's artwork in Batman Year One did. But as you delve into it, you find that it's a complex web of shadows that gives the panels depth. If you were to see it black and white, I think you would have the \\"extreme exposure\\" that you had with Frank Miller's Sin City artwork. This is groundbreaking comic book artwork.<br /><br />The subject matter of V for Vendetta left me thinking about whether we are free or not. As I was reading it, I couldn't help but keep thinking about 1984 and The Matrix. Not that the 1999 popcorn click is in the same caliber as this work of literature but the phrase \\"The Matrix has you\\" kept dancing around in my head. V is liberating those caught in the machine, especially when he \\"helps\\" Evey! Of course, the 1984 undertones are completely visible and there's no need to go any further into that. But his discourses on anarchy are very interesting. I don't know if I subscribe to V's theories but still it's worth thinking about.<br /><br />All in all V for Vendetta was fantastic and I'm glad I spent the hours in the wee morning reading it. When I loose sleep over something this good, I don't sweat it that much! I'm eager to see how the movie turns out. I just hope they don't #@&k it up like they did with From Hell and League.t's worth thinking about. <br /> <br />All in all V for Vendetta was fantastic and I'm glad I spent the hours in the wee morning reading it.

B00IIU9U00|4|Entertaining, light hearted, and classic DiCaprio
B00BAXFECK|5|A true work of art!  This novel is so well-written, with a plot that twists and leaps into the most unexpected places, through the awe- inspiring  life journey of the young protagonist/ narrator, one surprise after another; engaging subplots related to the world of art, literature, romance, sexuality, deceit, addiction, despair, depression, love, hope and friendship. The characters are described in such depth; with the fluid events of their lives changing each of them so subtly, yet so realistically and with compelling sensitivity. Symbolism and themes are uncovered as the stories of all these originally unconnected orphans blend into one big message about the biggest mysteries of humanity , especially questions about our undeniable fate and how each of us choose to live by our head or by our heart...all of us bound by chains, like the pet  goldfinch, of which we are often unaware... until it is too late. This is a modern classic!!! I can't wait to read it again........
B000056HE9|5|\\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is a very Vintage Classic from the Metro Goldwyn Mayer movie vault.  This 1948 Christmas film has all the yuletide spirit & joy for the family during the holidays.  This sleeper classic belongs among the \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (1946) & \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" (1947) movies also of the fabulous post World War II forties.  The nation and the world were experiencing renewed family life, church reunions and joyous faith.  Hollywood provided us with wholesome family entertainment.<br />This Black / White movie is presented with a clear digital picture and sound.  Standard size (before WideScreen), modified to fit your standard tv.  The movie is 1 hour and 49 minutes in length. (this was quite long for the 1940 double feature)  Extra Feature: an original movie trailer.  <br />Summary:  The Bishop (David Niven) & \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" (Loretta Young) are aided by a mysterious stranger (Cary Grant) during the Christmas Holidays.  The Bishop has reached a very difficult crossroad in his religious career.  Actually he becomes obsessed with building a new cathedral while abandoning all his basic roots & beliefs.  He prays for spiritual guidance and a stranger appears to assist him in his quest.  This stranger tells the Bishop he is an angel & he has answered his prayer.  While \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" has the faith & believes, the Bishop has doubt.  Will all be solved?  This is Hollywood.  Cary Grant is an Angel.  It is Christmas in the 1940's!!! What do you think?<br />The cast is perfect and the story is absolutely wonderful.<br />This movie is a wonderful holiday addition to the family Christmas DVD library!  Enjoy.
B008XOXGCO|5|This is my favorite Script album. Have been listening to it over and over. Music and lyrics have developed maturity since first two albums. Rather than a few great tunes, this one is outstanding all the way, with a nice variety of subject matter, melodies, and musical style. I would have expected far more radio play for these songs.
078324228X|5|I watched this with total absorption at the plight of this unusual man, the Hurricane.  His story, as others outlined in reviews here, is very sad and unjust:  accused of a crime he didn't commit by a racist cop with an odd hatred of him, he is thrown in prison at the height of his career.<br /><br />I thought that Denzel Washington was absolutely brilliant, bringing an entire environment and life story with him in each scene as only great actors can do.  He is perhaps the greatest actor in America today.  This performance is one of his best - you sense his internal struggle to survive, with little of it stated directly.  And he grows throughout the film, from a battered youth into a hyper-disciplined athlete, and then as an inmate seeking deeper meaning in life.  It is truly amazing how well he pulls this off.<br /><br />Then there is the youth who contacts him, a boy from a similar background who is given a chance by a remarkable and unorthodox household.  For some reason, the Hurricane responds to him after ignoring many others, and these two - as well as his foster parents - embark on their own journey of discovery.  As the youth matures, he learns about the political system and feels empowered to change things. That is a profoundly healthy of the American political system.  Eventually, they do change things, which is also a big step of trust and engagement for the Hurricane.  It is really beautiful and uplifting, deeply moving as I identified with both characters.<br /><br />I now want to learn about the protagonists, perhaps in biographies.  The story goes to the heart of an America in transition, when I grew up.  I do not know enough to answer the critiques about his character by other reviewers.<br /><br />While I think that more details should have been included in the film, the drama is taut and well told in my view.  It is a completely successful film experience and I am sure I will introduce this to my children when they are ready to learn about race in America.  FOrtunately, the racial tensions are infinitely less acute than when I grew up, so much of this will be historical for them.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.t race in America.

B001NA6096|5|I loved this movie the first time I saw it and I love it more with each subsequent viewing.  Amazing.
0763644765|5|I have twin boys and when it was time to potty train (about 2.5 y/o) this was a go-to book.  They LOVED this book.  So much in fact that I will probably keep it until they have kids...and I do not like storing &#34;things&#34;...so you can imagine this book is pretty darn awesome.
B00GOZQ2E8|5|Fun and exciting game! Almost like farm ville  but better. I saw my friend and i knew that i just had to get it.
B0069G5Z9K|5|This game is SO much fun! I can't stop playing it. I've had it for 3 days and beaten it 3 times.
B00BAXFAJC|4|Great book.
B001C5ZR1E|5|Just few words about this vinyl edition - perfect pressing (180 g), clear and dynamic sound ... wish there will be more vinyl albums like this one.
B00AFROVQC|5|I found this book on a bargain kindle books news feed and decided to download it just to see if it was as intriguing as the reviews made it out to be. I was not disappointed. I found myself wincing at the many scrapes the protagonist kept getting himself into, but his decency and refusal to back down even in the midst of so many trials and tribulations kept me reading. I am developing a special affection for this main character, an that hasn't actually happened to me in a very long time.<br /><br />One thing I did notice was the fact that at the beginning of the book there are two suns. As the book continued, however, I noticed that only one was mentioned. What happened to the second one? It's a very picky thing, but I'm like that sometimes. I also found myself wondering what will happen in the next book. I hate cliffhangers!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants something light, yet action packed an emotionally charged to read on a long flight or commute.
B008XBCJ34|4|The movie is great - the 3D quality is great - the only problem I had was that the product description was for the version with all the alternate endings and additional content - but this is NOT that - it's just the 3D version of the original theatrical release.<br /><br />Maybe I missed something - maybe the additional content was included on the DVD, which I have no reason to load since I'm using Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the quintessential 3D blockbuster and it's great to finally have it!

B00003CXXM|5|Okay, I saw the movie before reading the book. Loved the movie so much that I ran out to get the book only to find that the plot-lines went down separate paths right after the second page. Sure, there are similarities, and the fact is, both the movie and the book are excellent. As long as you don't try to make one follow the other.<br />I am glad that I bought the DVD, this is an excellent movie. It is fun to watch it over again. The sound on this movie is one of the best edits ever.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Candy crush is a fun and very very challenging game to play. I love that it just keeps going and going and they keep coming out with new levels all the time. Warning: this game can make you crazy with frustration. Some levels can take FOREVER to beat.

B0000AQS0F|5|I never got to watch Firefly when it was on Fox because they kept shifting the air time (the same thing they did to Futurama), only picking up the DVD set after reading soooooooo many glowing reviews.  I have to say that I am VERY impressed.  This show was excellent!  Great character development, a setting rife with adventure, great effects, and one hell of a story arch (that was sadly cut down before it even hit its peak).<br />Fox should be ashamed.  This proves to me that network executives are clueless as to what a good show is (just look at the statistics for this last season--something like 1 out of 18 new shows succeeded).<br />Here's to hoping the movie goes into production soon!  If I recall correctly, everyone has signed (happily) to be in a big screen version--but scheduling issues have pushed the release date back to 2005...

The app: I expected an app that could read pdfs (as this was the main reason I $$ it), and it works however has major flaws such as never reopening your pdf where you left off - no way to bookmark. The lack of these basic functions and the poor ability to navigate through my pdf - for an app I paid $10, makes this one of my worst app purchases. If the app wants to live up to it's ratings.... Where is my support?
B0047Y17P2|1|It is outrageous how high the kindle edition of books are.  They are obviously cheaper to produce.  Furthermore, the kindle edition is less likely to be shared by multiple readers the way hard copy is.  I am getting to the point where my kindle sits unused as I am boycotting high priced books.  I can pack 2 paperbacks for travel as easily my kindle and charger. While some will say, these kinds of comments do not belong in a review of the book,  I think the price of the book is part of the book.  As such the price deserves to be part of the review process.  With enough protest and boycotting , the kindle books may come down to a reasonable price.  I have not checked out the price of the nook ebooks. I think I may do that.    UPDATE...   To those who complain that price should have no bearing on the review, may I say the reviews are on the \\"Kindle edition\\" of the book. The price is a significant part of the \\"Kindle edition\\". In response to those who say, why did we buy a kindle if we were not willing to pay the price, I have three comments. First, I thought it was the correct thing to do environmentally.  Secondly, as an avid reader, I purchase 40-60 books a year. I thought ebooks would save me some money. Thirdly, people do not pay the same amount for the paperback edition as the hardcover.     In closing, apologies to Mr. Connelly, one of my favorite fiction writers.

0440418569|2|I too, like many of the other reviewers of this book, was very disappointed with the anticlimatical, convoluted conclusion to this trilogy.  But unlike many my disappointment has little to do with the heavy-handed anti-religion message of the book.  If I was somehow upset or offended by that I would have stopped reading book 1.  I was merely sad to see the story end the way it did with many characters seeming to have existed for no reason, and nothing really getting accomplished. <br /> <br /> <br />But on reflection, I wonder if the way the book was written was Pullman's ultimate \\"artistic\\" commentary on religion, life, etc.  In other words, maybe he is trying to say no matter how hard we look, life doesn't make any sense, and that religion(like the book) promises and exciting and rewarding payoff, but in the end only leaves you empty and confused.  If this is indeed the general idea of the style of the book, then perhaps this is the one that should have been titled \\"The SUBTLE Knife\\" because I think most people may have missed the point entirely.

B00000099Y|5|I've heard many a review of Tool's &quot;AEnema&quot;, one by amazon.com itself, call this album &quot;muddy&quot; and more &quot;disorganized&quot; than the superior band's other two albums; &quot;Opiate&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot;. I believe that &quot;AEnema&quot; is just as great as the other CD's, just that Tool is trying new kinds of music and takes their fans to other places. Even though the CD was released back in 1996, this album leaves fans guessing at the meanings to the lyrics and titles to this day.<br />This album has, by far, jumped to a new level than the other two Tool albums, both of which focused more on the hard rock and guitar riffs on most of the songs. Several songs on &quot;AEnema&quot; are softer and more lightly textured, but are by no means mellow. Songs such as &quot;jimmy&quot;, &quot;Pushit&quot;, and &quot;H.&quot; are toned down to less hard rock as songs such as &quot;Hooker With A Penis&quot;, but are just as energetic, meaningful, and powerful as every other Tool song. In fact, the contrast between the heaviness in some parts of the songs and the softer display gives a darker feel to the tunes. &quot;Forty Six &amp; 2&quot; is one of the best examples of how quickly the song can change beat and mood, yet still strangely hold onto and keep grasp of the same eerie atmosphere.<br />But old Tool fans don't have to worry. There is still that heavy, hard rock element in the majority of the songs on the album. The three singles &quot;Stinkfist&quot; &quot;Forty Six &amp; 2&quot;, and the title track &quot;AEnema&quot; have the more familiar, older style that Tool is known for. Other great reflections of Tool's raw power and energy are &quot;Hooker With A Penis&quot;, &quot;Third Eye&quot;, and &quot;Eulogy&quot;.<br />A close listener will also notice that Tool's music has become more experimental on this album, as is seen on all four of the instrumental tracks on the album. Although Tool's lyrics are part of their power and energy, they still give off a strange and haunting vibe and mood with the instrumental songs &quot;Useful Idiot&quot;, &quot;Intermission&quot;, &quot;Cesaro Summability&quot;, and &quot;(-) Ions&quot;. Also, the strangely woven &quot;Message To Harry Manback&quot; is a great example.<br />Whether you're not sure about Tool or are just a fan of their previos two albums, I recommend this album to you, and am quite confident that it will make a Tool fan out of you. This is a great CD, and definitely belongs on real music fans shelves. The songs and lyrics are deep, and make you both think and feel them. What's not to like?

B005PK57IK|5|I love TV series that take the time for characters to develop week after week. Like the peeling of an onion, layers of intricacy unfold as the writers masterfully reveal characters' strengths and flaws, creating an almost hypnotic pull for the viewer to see the next episode. I find that the development of Zack and Grace has been remarkable. Storylines are well-thought out, compelling and, most importantly, believable. The actors are outstanding, using subtlety and nuance to convey what words alone sometimes cannot. This is must-see TV.
