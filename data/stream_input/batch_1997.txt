B004UNX1LS|4.0|Good app, but is behind on latest video's. Does not give direction to find other video's not in this system.  Usable for my needs at present.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great science fiction series, too bad it was not continued, has lots of good story lines.  I also bought Serenity to complete the series.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|From start to finish this was loaded with action, and special effects; close to the original but trust me, didn't miss Arnold one bit!!
1416972242|5.0|I could not put this one down. I think I read it in about 10 hours. You can't help but read it fast because you want to know what demons the kids are fighting now and if they can find some way to be together. The Inquisitor is maddening and you find yourself hating her and then forgiving her or at least understanding her a little better. Now, I have to get the third book City of Glass. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B004GNFSO0|4.0|This is another incredible story about the resilience of the human spirit.  It is done in a narrative  style which sometimes lacks powerful dramatic impact but reflects the sometime fuzzy recollection of the author.  Some of this is probably due to malnutrition and deprivation.  I found it a compelling read for those who enjoy reading stories of human survival. If you enjoyed  unbroken your will like this story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love love.... it's the only words I can use to describe how I feel about this book! Love. Love.
B005NPB7K4|4.0|This is a great complilation of classic rockabilly along with some new tracks.  Chris channels the old style so well that it's impossible to tell the new from the old!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the passion Chris and the band display on stage doesn't quite come through in the studio.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Matt Damon is one of my favorites.  I really loved the plot of this movie; it was really well-done.<br /><br />Nice little twist at the end too with a nice love story intertwined.<br /><br />Entertaining and the acting (of all involved) was excellent.
0061726834|5.0|This is a fast pace book that holds your interest throughout. A quick read easy that has you falling in love with characters and living vicariously through them. I haven't read a book this moving since Babara Delinsky's Three Wishes. I recommend this book to any reader young or old.
0060245867|5.0|Awesome book! This is my favorite book and has always been since elementary! My older sister gave this book to my two year old son for Christmas and it has become his favorite book. He even \\"reads\\" it to me because he has memorized the story of this fun and energetic little mouse. A must have in every little kids library.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the one you will use every day. The buttons are big enough to be practical, and the display is easy to resd.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app runs great on my Kindle Fire.  Good stuff.  The info is provided in an organized and stylish fashion.  Thanks!!
B0093H8H8I|5.0|I bought this for a Windows XP build to play several older games that won't play on Windows 7. Paired it with an Asrock H77 Pro/MVP motherboard running XP Pro 32-bit. No doubt runs everything like a charm. Using an Nvidia 8400GS which is plenty enough for all the games. Tried to keep costs down.
B003O86FMW|2.0|This was disappointing. Don't bother. It was just a round about idiot fest. Katniss must be the dumbest character ever.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|The second installment of this exciting trilogy doesn't leave you wanting anything but more! Equally as entertaining and fast paced as the first. You get to know the characters on a personal level leaving you fully invested in seeing what happens next.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Being in \\"non-sales\\" - this book made me think about my daily interactions in a whole new way.  Filled with tips and exercises to sharpen your skills - I have already put it into practice with positive results! A must read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian is a thoroughly enjoyable book, well written and meat and potatoes for a hard-science fiction fan. There's a lot of good humor and amusing moments that add spice to the work.<br />The story of human survival against an environment hostile to life is classic. The hero, Mark, uses the most powerful tools at his disposal, his brain, science and a will to live. The science is well done. The author did his homework on this one.<br />The characters are fleshed out without much in the way of description of their physical appearance. Hard to accomplish, but it works and works well.<br />The race to save himself from starvation and his numerous trials as an astronaut marooned on Mars gives this novel a fast-paced pitch. It's the same with the folks stuck on earth who are trying desperately to rescue him. You're rooting for him and his rescuers all the way.<br />In short The Martian is great read and I recommend it to any lover of good science fiction.<br />Doug Welch, author of Shadow Spies.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The book offered a fascinating and very personal look inside North Korea. The reality of the human situation was both mesmerizing and also sadly, horrifying.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It was Scarpetta at her best. Patricia Cornwell's books about Kay Scarpetta are her best books. This one was clearly written ; had lots of action. An exciting read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love every aspect of this app.  It's very comprehensive, gives full days view of the weather.  I have children and relatives spread out all over the country, it was easy to store and retrieve their cities in \\"favorites.\\"
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Dashner continues the maze runner legacy in this new prequel. It had the same action as those that came before. The story exploring the origins of the insidious Flare leaves you breathless with just a touch of hope left in world where there should be none.<br /> I really enjoyed this book.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|We heard him on a PBS special and enjoyed his show.  We think he has talent similar to Stevie Ray Vaughn, Similar, not exceeding.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I think that the absence of Matt Damon made a huge difference in the &#34;Legacy&#34;.  From the very last scene in the &#34;Ultimatum&#34;, viewers knew that Bourne had survived and it would have been possible to have his story continue with Matt Damon.
B00005JMX6|5.0|I have this movie in it's original version and wanted the unrated.  I did not see any difference in the actual movie but there are some additional behind the scene and interviews.  Great movie I will never get tired of watching.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|If your a parent or grandparent you should buy this DVD, It has a good story-line and your kids will love it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Nice app to have.  Not as convenient as AB on my laptop, but works great for a quick fix of AB while at the airport.
B0057ZEMF2|5.0|There are few occasions where a person encounters music that is really out of their usual. This album took visits some exotic, romantic, and passionate places that other music will rarely if ever encountered. What's more, it has a timeless and almost placeless sound to it.<br />I recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Grandkids love it.  It's a very entertaining game for my 8 year old grandson.  I'd definitely recommend it to all.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Somewhat predictable story but some creative alien machines. Rihanna played a great role in this movie. I love seeing all of the naval vessel footage.
B00008WT5M|5.0|Bought this for my son for Christmas.  I too am an AC DC fan and enjoy it as well.  The packaging was very good and delivery time was very fast.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am sometimes unhappy with the book I find on Amazon with great reviews.If you worry about that to,this is not one of those times....It is a amazing story that will make you fall in love with the characters.I caught myself laughing out loud crying so hard it was more like a sob and shocked... This is a must read! Five Stars for sure....
B004SIIBGU|5.0|For my purposes. I'm not a big ebayer; however, the little bit I do, this app gives me a chance to see it on the go.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I'm still very new to the whole e-anything. This popped up on the free app of the day, so I grabbed it. Right off the bat I played with it for a few minutes till I got a handle on how to maneuver. I made the kids laugh when I put the ear buds in my ears and danced to Celtic music around the house with my Kindle Fire stuck in my back waste-band.  Huge choice of streaming music from every genre from around the world. Since it was one of my new experiences in the e-music or streaming music, I'm hooked. Get this app, YES, recommended. .
B008Z9L94O|1.0|Thought I would get lucky and receive an \\"undistorted\\" vinyl copy through Amazon but to no avail. Several songs were unlistenable. I'm sending back tomorrow. I wish those few people who said they received perfect copies would post which 3rd party sellers they ordered from so maybe I could order from them and maybe get a good one but oh well. Look in your mailbox Amazon cause here it comes back to you.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Bought this for my mom's birthday and she absolutely loved it! The story is fantastic and I love the ending.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Had this on VHS back in the day!  Very good story about the amazing power of the heart.  Funny too!  Came in right on time and packaged well so as not to be damaged in shipment.  Very satified
0061148512|1.0|I had high expectations of this book because Sylvia Plath came highly recommended by a reliable source, but I was counting the pages until I was done, painfully waiting for the book to get interesting and it never happened. It is easily in the top 3 worse books I've ever read category.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Hello this weather app is very acurate. I love it and I am passing this app to others. Good job
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has been one of the best apps I,'ve found! I play it during my morning routine to relax and get ready to greet the day. My only major annoyance is that I can't play it while I'm doing anything else on my kindle fire.
B00760BPOC|2.0|A number of other reviews point out what's great about this series of books is the author's willingness to have important characters die. Death in the world constructed by Martin is often random, cruel and always frequent. It helps make the world feel all the more solid. I like this side of the books.<br /><br />What I didn't enjoy is the complete lack of any 'end' to the story. After about third book I started wondering what the point was. I'm slow so it wasn't till I finished the last one that I worked out the open endedness is about being able write another book. It became clear to me this was all about selling books. In the end it just feels too cynical to be enjoyable.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very interesting, kept me turning the pages.  I would recommend the book, can't wait to start reading the remaining sequels.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I'm a fan of marvel comics, and this movie collects all of my super heroes ....luv'it....too bad I didn't bought it 3d....
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Interesting story, though I wish the mini-games were a little moee challenging.  I do like that I don't have to do the item find (can play another game instead)
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I bought my brother the first 3 movies and then another. The 4th movie I got him, he already owned. So I got him this instead. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time with no issues.
B0034JKZ8G|5.0|This was a movie I gave as a gift.  The recipient said she loved it, it is one of her favorites.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this trilogy for my 13 year old nephew for Christmas. He was so excited!  He read the first book within 24 hours.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|So much information for all ages to understand and learn from. Knowledge is. Everything these days. I will recommend to my friends, family and neighbors.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I watched the movie on Christmas Day, and I wanted to read the book, excellent addition to my collection....it's a keeper!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book so much. It made me cry and laugh and it is honestly my favorite book I have ever read. It's so perfect.
B000000WI4|3.0|Not my favorite &#34;HOOK&#34; but good enough---but the jacket cover is worth whatever price is being charged to a collector like me
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Get it while it is still on sale. Recommended!<br />Planning to get the other starwars sets when the discounts come around.
0062124293|1.0|I could only get halfway through this book before I threw it away. Usually, I give books I don't like away, but I figured no one would want to read this one. If you are looking for a fun introduction to feminism or just an interesting memoir, avoid this book. Moran is a poor writer and an embarrassment to feminism.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This Smith & Wesson sharpener is great not only for S&W knives, but for all other pocketables as well. It is light, but well built so it feels sturdy, and comes with three types of sharpeners, all meant for different things. There is an included manual that you can read once, then toss (or just toss out because you think you're better than that). The sharpener is important for anyone to have if they plan on having a survival kit, as knives go dull, and once they're dull, they're fairly useless. This sharpener might not be as good as your ceramic knife, but when you're stranded miles away from any sort of working toilet, you're probably not going to have your ceramic rod with you either.<br /><br />Even though the world didn't end recently, it doesn't mean you don't have to buy this sharpener now. Set up a price watch, and nab one for yourself before your next big outdoor expedition. We all know you won't really need it, but it doesn't hurt to have it tucked away. Just in case.
B005IGDW24|5.0|I started buying movies for my new led 3d tv....and luckily I found this movie, a very sweet and funny movie for all ages....
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This is the best book ever! It leaves you wanting to read more. You have to read this series it's awesome. I can't wait for the next book in this series to comer out!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Good story enjoyed this book....was different than my normal reads but well worth the time.......recommended for sure to anyone. Amazing.
B000KJT8IG|2.0|I doubt I need to add another review of the movie.  It's been on a short list of required viewing every Christmas season.  The disappointing part is thinking the upgrade from dvd to blu ray will reap improved audio and video.  Sadly, the audio remains flat, compressed, and lacking in dynamics.  Worse, the film transfer has to be one of the worst in recent memory.  Every scene contains unacceptable amounts of grain and noise that's only magnified by the increased resolution.  Granted, it's a silly comedy and not an Oscar winning masterpiece, but considering the number of copies the studio will sell every Christmas season you'd think they'd throw a few bucks into restoring it.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|My teenage daughter loves it.  I have to listen to it all day and all night....and I can actually feel my feet tapping to it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Enjoy reading the development of the main character. The how's & whys of Jack Reacher as he interacts with the other characters in the story.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|I like when in the movie they mix fiction with real facts.....it makes the movie more real....it's a keeper too.
0345803485|1.0|I know that everything has been said about this 'book', but I'll add some more.<br />This paper pile has not the right to be called a book, that word is too big for this.<br />It's not only the bad writing, poor plot, and idiotic characters, it's the fact that the marketing tools turned this into a best-seller when this pile only deserves to be used as a toilet paper.<br /><br />I lost respect for Amazon when I saw all these fake 5-star reviews (yes, they are fake, we all know). Surely, they earn a lot of money, but what about fairness? Honesty? It does not mean anything anymore, right?<br />Now, only cash matters.<br />Poor world, poor human race. This time we stooped too low.
B00004X10B|5.0|Bought this bag for my daughter. She is working as a professional photography. It can fit everything Isherwood needs to do a job. Highly recommend.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|If you are a Johnny Cash fan, this CD is a must for your collection.  Great songs from &#34;The Man in Black&#34;
B007RE0SCW|5.0|It was a Christmas present and I don't think that there has been one day gone by that she has not played with it
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's writing is crisp and the story moves along.  If you have read any of his previous novels, you will enjoy this storyline.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|Dont really trust uploading my printjobs to the ePrint server inorder to print..not sure I trust that they aredeleting my print jobs after I print.
1613823444|5.0|This is one of my most favorite books which i love re-reading once in a few years.<br />What makes this one a timeless classic is that it never grows old despite the story taking place more than a century ago. Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.<br />My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.<br />i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).<br />This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have.
B0060MYKTY|4.0|Was Sad to get the First Season in Blue Ray, English Only (Yes you see this in Small charters) then 6 months later Blue-Ray English and French is Released so 45$ again if you wish to get it in your mother tongue.<br />For Seaon 2. Was Very Upset, to get a DVD release and No Bluray, while in Europe the Bluray has been there for 3-4 months already.<br />To Add to Frustration. Amazon UK/FR do not deliver in Québec, and As French People Living in North America, we are also stuck with the NTSC format. In Short, This Crap blocking the Video Format is only impacting French peopleFrom Québec. USA prefers English and Spanish while French movies distributed in France are Not Readeable because of this Zoning stupidity.<br />To Finish up.<br />Amazon.dot Com does not deliver Outside of USA.<br />What a Nightmare, especially where we are supposed to have Freetrade Agreement in Place for 20 years. Way to Go Amazon....!!!!<br />Amazon dot CA cost more, or does not have the same product available. Worst, the Suggested links driving you to amazon UK or else, you book the order and guess what? We only deliver to US Address. Fantastic...<br />I can order with E-Bay from Honkong, China, Europe, but Amazon US, Impossible!!!<br />Hope the Blu Ray The Borgia will be available within 6 month is Amazon.ca.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Louis
B00979CS50|3.0|I love Neil Young but this CD is boring.  This is not one of his best CD's that he has released.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read the 3 books in no time. Very easing reading. Enjoyed the series of books.Loved reading the books on my Kindle.
B0099114WO|5.0|GREAT MOVE- ANOTHER MOVIE THAT YOU MUST WATCH MOR THAN ONCE. PENTY OF LUAGHS AND SERIOUS PARTS.YOU WILL ENJOY IT
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I like the app.  It connects pretty smoothly almost always but you have to make sure you have a good network connect.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I basically thought the book was somewhat boring....which surprised me because it's #1 on so many lists.  I did not find the behavior of any of the characters convincing or realistic .. no match for Tana French.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I just feel the beginning has too many names,words that our extremely long and confusing.  I plan on seeing the film and then return to reading.  I haven't read very far into the book but it is frustrating to me as I can't keep up with all the characters.  Perhaps, seeing the film will help
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Did not get to see this at the movies but I knew the plot.  It's the future for sure.  Justin Timberlake was outstanding in this move.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book. I could not put it down. Once I finished the book I had to order the second book right away. Loved it!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Typical good Google performance...no problems at all.  I haven't had it very long, but I'm sure it will always give me what I want.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|This card works great and passes the shake test...the memory cards stay put.  The only draw back is getting my fingernail on those micro sd card lips to pull them out of this holder.  Those micro sd cards are so small, they make even holding them in your hand difficult.  I liked this card holder so much I tried to see if they made one that held just SD cards.(couldn't find it)  This card gives me both sizes of memory cards in one holder and they won't fall out.  I like it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A very thought provoking story. Makes one think about what's important in life and why you should be in constant pursuit of your goals.
B000000XBC|4.0|alwas liked the swap music and gave some derict meening of the time in which a lot of protest was going on and can flash back as to what I was doing
B009GESJH2|3.0|I am a big Kid Rock fan and his last CD &#34;Born Free&#34; was excellent.  This one was a tab bit boring.  Every song sounded the same to me.  Still love Kid Rock!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the series of all three books very much.  I could not put the books down. Great story to read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This ap is a no brainer.  I don't know why Amazon doesn't pre-load it from the beginning.  Who doesn't need a calculator?
B00633W614|5.0|Totally recommend this book as I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the third book to be published, Jeffrey Archer is an awesome author.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this book! Could not put it down!<br />  Would definitely recommend to anyone both young and old. Can't wait to read the next one.
B004OEMRGI|5.0|I saw these guys at Globalquerque last year, and they are fantastic!  And so is this CD.  Give it a listen.
B009NOVCTM|2.0|Nothing special on this CD.  This is for someone who does not have The Rolling Stones CD's in their collection.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This alblum is easy to listen to over and over.  I only wish that &#34;Fade Into You&#34; was on it.
B00122PUL4|5.0|I bought this for only $5.99. What a great bargain! I love almost every song! I like the way they give you songs before and after his solo career. Good job!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great. I loved it!  It makes you sad, happy, and mad.  You really feel for the characters. Very hard to put down.  And the ending was surprising.
B004Q3QRWC|5.0|Great bunch of stories within a brilliantly constructed interlocking narrative, topped off with the best use ever made of powerpoint!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Five stars because I absolutely love Rick riordan and all his series. I would recommend this book to as anyone who has read the first and second books yo the series and to anyone who enjoyed or is interested in the Percy Jackson series or Kane chronicles. This is a REALLY GOOD BOOK....
B008FPOIT6|4.0|It was an easy read.  It kept my interest to the last page.  It had a plausible whack-ness that worked well.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was like playing a Pc game on my Kindle Fire.  It had no bugs and was a lot of fun.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked the game, it was was fun and kept me entertained for a good little while. Wish it would have been longer but a lot longer than other free apps
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I love this app. It is just what I needed. I love the ability to see how much battery life is left.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Did not disappoint me. You actually feel that you are fighting along side with Katniss, Gale and the rebels. Was pleased with the ending. Seemed very appropriate.
0061438294|5.0|Love it!!! Very fast shipment. This book will help you read people whether they are at work, family, or dating.
0718157834|2.0|How did this book get so many recommendations? I've read better Harlequin and Silhouette Romances. Actually, this book made me go back and read Sandra Brown's Adam's Fall. A much better book with more interesting leads and same subject matter. SPOILERS: I guess this book is different since it kills off a lead. How uninspiring and lazy is that? I guess living is just not dramatic enough. I found Will a very annoying character who was not interesting in the least. I guess I needed to see him climbing a mountain. God knows he talked about enough.<br /><br />I also thought the change in points-of-view at certain places very unnecessary. I just found this book to be all over lazy. It reminded me of One Day by David Nicholls, another lazy book.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Yesterday finally get my order, is the first time that I can think of this problem, but it will be the last service amazon and deadlines are met. I am very happy as this product looked forward since December, and be more than satisfied with this collector's edition.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This fourth book in the Outlander series is another wonderful example of the storytelling abilities of Diana Gabaldon. I first read these books 20 years ago, and have since reread them many times. Excellent books are hard to put down!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was REALLY into the book until about 3/4 of the way through it.  It seems like the author just got bored with writing and threw together that horrible ending.  All in all, I love the author's writing style...but I have read much better books.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Difficult plot line to follow. We felt the director needed to retell the story  from a less abstract stance. Maybe Bruce was tired, too.
B00493E1GI|2.0|I LOVED this book so much, I re-read it. And I put it on a shelf with my favorite books. The movie was very disappointing, even though I LOVE Julia Roberts in every other movie I have seen of hers.<br />The movie seemed almost plot-less and dull, and I found myself distracted and just waiting for it to end. And I regretted spending the money to purchase it, as I know I will not watch it again.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I read this because my 7th grader will be reading this soon and wanted to be prepared. As a caveat to my review, it is important to mention that she is 3 yrs behind grade level and relatively immature for her age. It took reading half way through to get the \\"utopian\\" idea. Prior to that language could be tough to follow without knowing the theme. I would have enjoyed more time with the giver and the development of that relationship along with a more purposeful recognition of Jonas' realization of his community and parents. I realize this was written from Jonas' perspective, but she made me care about how the \\"community\\" would manage the memories and I felt I was left wondering. I did enjoy the story but felt there was more to say. I am not sure what she will make of the story as a whole. There are certain topics within the story that she will understand, with guidance, but I don't know how well she will grasp his \\"mental leaps\\" .
B008EKOO46|4.0|This book is exactly what its title promises: A look at the lessons we should take from traditional societies. Happily, it isn't another romanticized vision in which the traditional societies are better in every way; Diamond points out that there are very good reasons most societies abandoned the traditional models for larger and  LESS warlike social organizations, and to dine regularly,. But he does point out that the benefits of more complex civilizations have come with unintended and negative consequences. More helpfully, he points out that these consequences are not inevitable. For example, diabetes is almost unknown in people living traditional lifestyles, and quick to appear once these people have adopted the ways of Western society. Yet he advances evidence that the means of preventing it can be found in studying traditional diets and eating habits, without returning to periodic famines.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|Director Stephen Soderbergh and star Channing Tatum establish an extremely relaxed atmosphere in \\"Magic Mike.\\" The screenplay by Reid Carolin is loosely \\"inspired\\" by Tatum's own early days as a \\"male dancer/stripper.\\" Soderbergh shoots every scene, except those inside Club Xquisite, through a double straw filter. It looks as though the camera lens has a huge  ray of sunshine attached to it. It all looks so unreal. And, if the outside world of super-sunny Florida is unreal, then so is Club Xquisite. The best  thing about \\"Magic Mike\\" is how it makes the life and work of male strippers \\"unsexy.\\" Sex isn't sexy if it's a business, and we see how every move, bump, grind, and gyration that sends the female customers (where are the gay men in this movie? Because, trust me, gay men are the real target audience for,  and are watching,  this movie)  into sexual frenzy is a calculated business.  Captivating performances by Tatum, Matthew McConaughey and Alex Pettyfer keep things interesting.<br />  McConaughey is Dallas, the ultimately self-centered owner and mentor at Xquisite, and \\"Magic Mike\\" Lane (Tatum) is the star attraction in the stable of  male hotties. Tatum has a natural confidence and charisma. At age 30, he is smart enough to know that he can't keep bumping, grinding, and gyrating forever. He works odd jobs and hopes to one day design his own line of custom furniture. He befriends Adam (Pettyfer), literally, the new \\"Kid\\" at Xquisite. He is also attracted to Adam's sister (Cody Horn). Worried about how Adam will handle the stripper lifestyle, she asks Mike to take care of him. Mike promises to do so, but that doesn't turn out too well.<br />  Adam becomes a stripping sensation faster than Natalie Wood in \\"Gypsy\\" (1962). Adam, it turns out, is a natural born stripper; despite the fact that Dallas initially tells him, \\"You take your clothes off like a 12 year old  n a locker room.\\" Adam quickly dives into easy money, booze, drugs, and cheap sex; just as Mike grows sick of the lifestyle. In the end, Mike has had enough and (drug-addicted) Adam is  all set to take his place as #1 Stud at Xquisite. So, does \\"Magic Mike\\" aim to be the \\"A Star Is Born\\" of male stripper movies? Such a question will likely never bother the average viewer, who will likely view \\"Magic Mike\\" as agreeable cinema eye candy and nothing more. \\"Magic Mike\\" may not know where it is going (maybe it has nowhere to go?); but I still appreciated the fact that Soderbergh's and Tatum's interest in the characters is obviously more than just skin deep.sick of the lifestyle.

B0076DCT2G|2.0|Too flippant. To many trite comments. Background for geography, weapons, and politics was good. Think DeMille is losing it. Time for him to hang it up. I've read every book he's written.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great graphics and decent story for a hidden object game. Tired of people complaining that its not actually free. You get to play through half of the entire game and make up your mind on whether you like it or not. So take the opportunity and then if you do like it, just buy it! Not many games of this quality are free.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read other Vince Flynn novels and I love his direct approach to his subject matter.  If contemporary actiion novels are your &#34;thing&#34;, I highly recommend The Last Man.
B000002AGN|5.0|Classic and fabulous.  How can a mind conceave such a simple but complex pice of music?<br />I reccommend it for those how don't think that they like jazz.
B009X00E18|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of this case, and still prefer my hefty Otterbox to this one. The MicroShell Folio case is simply too flimsy for what I do with my Kindle: it gets stuffed in any number of bags, it goes on hiking trips with me (I put pdf maps on it, but also read on it during the commute to the trails)... it slips off the edge of my bed at night when I fall asleep reading.<br /><br />I also found that the Kindle occasionally pops out of this case. So, thanks but no thanks: I'll stick with the Otterbox.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I liked the usual twist of mission impossible. The action was great as well.  Not a Tom Cruise fan but he is a good actor
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i am legally blind, somehow ordered 2 of this great video, (sad) and now wish i had prime..<br />this is the perfect tool for visually impaired people who have some vision.  it is much better than an audio book, as you really get the picture.<br />the story is very facinating and i will be sad when it is over.  i highly recommend it for history buffs.  keep more coming.  thank you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing Bingo Blitz on FB for years now and was SOOO excited to see it become an app for my iPhone and Kindle!! Now I can play it anywhere and anytime!
B00884GR0W|5.0|If you're wondering how I got it for free, the answer is a few weeks back, it was the Free App of the Day. AWESOME app! I would recommend it for people who enjoy Minecraft, since it's simalar to the game that inspired Minecraft.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A very thought provoking book, book discussion club all gave it a thumbs up and we're still talking about it - especially in light of mental health and pending gun law reform.
B00361CAEE|5.0|Gave my first one away and loved love love this movie so much I wanted on my own.  Such an inspirational movie.
B0032FPVKE|3.0|The camera fits really snug. It may be a little snug for my camera . . . . . .
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|Well how shall I put this... I can honestly say that ....  because I got this while it was offered for free... the only thing I wasted was my time and a small amount of battery power...!  Sorry but can't find too much good to say..  well then again ... at least the mouse was cutish...EEK! Deleted it after ten minutes of &quot;playing&quot;(using playing for lack of a better word) ... Sorry but  BORING comes to mind...
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was an incredible, heart wrenching and uplifting read. Cheryl is a bad ass b**ch. Her writing style is great to read and you experience her harrowing memories with her. It's multi faceted like her journey and just a great read.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I had never seen this movie before purchasing it, but it is definitely worth watching over and over. Fantastic movie, fantastic cast.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book I think it's just amazing<br /><br />The most interesting book ever :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I played this game years ago on the PC.  This is a great version for the android. I wish there were more levels. It does not have the zen garden or endless survival mode.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I wanted to love it because i devoured the Harry Potter books but this was dark and depressing and had NO redeeming qualities. I had to finish it because I thought something good would happen but it never did. Yuck!
B003MC5N28|5.0|It's a great book and I like the intro to it .Was really good book over all .Hope you do to!!!!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Hey, it's alternate history with a big bang! With Tarantino, you know what you get. I liked Kill Bill better but this was still enjoyable.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|If you were a fan of the other movies in this trilogy, then you will not be disappointed by the epic conclusion. Fantastic movie all around!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing! So many twists and turns! I loved it! Best book I've read in a long time
B0067R0APK|3.0|It does a fair weather information<br />I know it was free, but why i still have the &quot;Sale&quot; sign over the icon!!!
B007QPFGJW|3.0|It was a good story line and plot, but it lost its way at the ending.  Is that the end of the harry hole series?
B000SGGUWS|5.0|OMG I love this book so much it is so freaking good!!!(: it is probably one of my all time FAVORITE books!!!(:
B000FGGE68|5.0|Sometimes, you just want to suspend belief and enjoy the unreality of SF. This fits the bill. It is actually relaxing to watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found Wool to be multi-layered and well written. Character development was indepth but concise without feeling cumbersome. Great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing.  I could not out this book down. I loved the characters. A must read  read it in two days
B00013F38K|4.0|this is one of those Classic shows with lines that everyone mimicks (Grasshopper) and remembers for its cheesy-ness, but also, for its time, it really was a good show - any problems with it are few and minor, I mean, in the 70's no one questions Carradine pleaying a half Chinese Monk, but today's audience would rip it apart.<br /><br />All in all, this is a greta and classic show and one that I enjoy watching with my wife and teenage son.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I loved this season!! Dean and Sam are amazing as usual and they keep the surprises coming! I love this show!
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|Very satisfied with the cd, no scratches and was well wrapped. Would ordered from this company again and recommend them to anyone if they wanted to but from this company. Thank-you
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I read all four books back to back.  They were all wonderful and I can't wait to see what else these amazing ladies come up with in the future.
0765325950|1.0|Regardless of whatever the wife of the auhtor thought, the book publishers are responsible for the lack of acceptance of the ebook format.  To deny that the ebook format is what ALL books will be one day is ridiculous.  And people let them do this to us.  They allow publishers to price ebooks and paperbacks at the same price.  Authors are shovled money for contracts of silence.  All the while these publishers are sitting back, relaxed and smiling in their massive market share, waving at us with their middle finger raised.<br /><br />I hope that this book does not make it to #1 on a bestseller list because of this.  It will be an perfect lesson in the future for authors and publishers that while they might create a product, it is the FANS THAT MAKE THEM MONEY.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I like the different levels and keeps me going for hours a good stress relief.  And a very fun game
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun and very affordable to the public and very addicting I love it when I love it when I love the idea of making it!I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!I LOVE PUDDING MONSTER`S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZQBP3Q|3.0|This cd is hit or miss.  There are a handful of songs that are good and a handful that are terrible.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK, AND KEPT MY INTEREST THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. AT TIMES, IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO FOLLOW BUT A GOOD READ ANYWAY.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang theory is a great show and very funny, season 3 definitely met my expectations ad highly recommend it to anyone
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This is not a very good digital bible to download, especially when there are others more substantial and easier to use.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Its a cool game I loved it until I got to level 40 but before that it was great lets u only do 4 times before u have yo wait 20 mins before u can play again
B006LSZECO|5.0|And I thought I had issues!!!  Very dark and scary but couldn't wait to get to next page and next and  well u get it.
B006O6F932|5.0|This was a gift to my daughter who is really into Monster High.  It is a nice size playset but an even better part about it is that it closes up into a compact easy to move case.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY BORING WITH NO REAL PURPOSE TO IT.. WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN IT..I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND SERIOUSLY...I'M KIDDING TO ANYONE.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Never had any idea of the dedication and lives given to be a navy seal. This book enlightened me and kept wanting to read more.
1400069289|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my son & he loved it! Get it now before they are all gone!
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|This Jack Reacher novel ties in the army Jack to the drifter with a few more than unusual  plot twists along the way.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is simply the best programming I've ever watched on television.  The writing is supberb, the characters - especially Maggie Smith! are perfect in their roles. You care about these people and their fate. The storyline segments are fast paced enough so you know you'll always get a chance to see your &#34;favorite&#34; character - yet long enough to sustain your interest.<br />And it is a visual feast for the eyes.  As a family we can't wait for each episode and dole them out like treats to keep it going as long as possible.  The wait between seasons feels interminable.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so cool! I love it!I had to buy this book because I've read all of the other books
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although I have yet to finish the book, I love it.  I am a little afraid of how attached I am becoming to the characters even though I know this probably won't end well
B004SRNH10|4.0|Haven't really used it much yet, but I like what I have seen so far.  Really cool that I can use my phone as a pdf reader.
B008M721MS|4.0|my skype review was great because in my kindle i can not contact with everybody but when i downloaded skype i get to contact with every body
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an excellent series.  The cast and acting are supburb!  I look forward to watching each epsode.  Well done!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This one is fun!  What a challenge!  Adicted to get three stars!  Some a very difficult to beat, requires great skill!
B0063IH60K|3.0|The dealing options in this game are obscure.  &quot;Winning deal&quot;?  Why play the game if you are guaranteed a win?
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My kids and I love this game!!  I can't believe it took us so long to get into Angry Birds!!
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|I enjoy playing classical music in the afternoons while I write. This complete collection of Mahler's works is very conducive to thinking and, later on, relaxing. He was a very powerful and creative composer. This set is well worth the money and well worth the listening.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I bought this album because I am a BIG fan of the show. I love all the songs on this but especially love the haunting voice of Claire Bowen!! A must have if you are a country fan even if you don't watch the series on TV.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is a very nice tool.  It keeps all my notes organized and easy to use.  I use this one daily.
B002361MLA|4.0|Eckhart Tolle doesn't disappoint with this book.  As a &#34;new ager&#34; I found it added to what I already believe.  Great book!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I didn't think this series could get any better after the second book, I was wrong, this book is the best by far!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I had to give this five stars because I'll do anything I can to encourage intelligent, scripted television instead of the backstabbing, loudmouth reality television we've been fed the last few years. My mind thrives on trying to solve a good mystery. Although it's a stretch to have a female Watson, this is one of the better adaptations of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories I've seen yet. I hope they don't let the setup of the sexual tension darken the stories. It would be a shame to let that happen, but it's not my typewriter pounding out the scripts.<br /><br />I'll watch faithfully to see what happens.
B000VSBX34|5.0|It was a gift. It arrived on time. I assume the product was OK. The recipient thanked me. What more can I say?
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Call me biased, but I upgraded from an ancient dual-core CPU to the i5-3470 and I'm in heaven.  Dual core chips are slowly but surely becoming obsolete and quad-cores will be the minimum required to run new games in the not too distant future.  I went with this quad-core for the price mostly.  Other i5 3rd gen chips are at least $200 or more, and I managed to grab this one at $179.99.<br /><br />The benchmarks are great for the i5-3470 compared to quite a few others in the i5 3rd gen Ivy Bridge series as well.  I can run very graphic demanding games with good frames per second on max settings when coupled with my EVGA GTX 660 SC video card, and I'm fairly certain this will be the case for a couple years to come.<br /><br />You can't overclock this chip as it's not a K series chip, but if you don't plan on overclocking anyway, then this chip should do just fine for ya.
0738212415|4.0|I can already draw a bit, and I find this book incredibly easy to get through. I took out 1 star because of the easiness. However, this is a great beginner book, so if you want to learn how to draw, this is definitely the book for you! The author will show you step by step on how to draw everything in the book (shadows, trees, 3D objects, realistic face, hand). He pretty much holds your hand throughout the entire book.
B009FXIICK|5.0|Matching three animals couldn't be any easier! Love it, Love it, Love it!!  My kids love it too, really, really fun!
0871164566|5.0|This book solved the way for me to fix a broken glass pendant. The instructions are clear. There is a nice range of items to keep me inspired.
0385344228|5.0|This novel was well written and kept me guessing throughout.  Very imaginative but the author knows his facts. What a page turner.
B009V3KKXY|3.0|The Book was ok, it does have some good knots but I'm not that much into braclets.<br />If that is what you want to tie then it'll be an excellent book for that. I had hoped for<br />some nice key fob type spiral knots.  This just my opinion, I was a bit disappointed<br />but others will be elated.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|[...see SPOILER at end of review if need more info on the traumatic elements in order to decide for yourself]<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Very well done. A plot. A real, actual, structurally sound plot. With subplots. That make sense and tie up and enrich and reinforce the central plot. So that even if there is a moment where something seems to come out of left field...oh, yes, it all comes together in the end. And it makes sense.<br /><br />And romantic tensions. And NOT love / enemies at first sight. I cannot tell you how happy that made me. Something more real and likely. And I liked that the protagonist, while (at first) a little lost within the navigation of romantic waters, was strong enough to not just ride along with the sexual pressure because it would be easier / less antagonistic / whatever.<br /><br />I believed in her.<br /><br />Now, I did see a few of the &#34;revelations&#34; coming, but I was surprised by how the revelations were resolved and I thought that it was organically done. Also, since I do actively study plot structure, I tried not to judge it because I saw &#34;around&#34; a few corners. A year ago, I probably would not have, and even so, I still loved every word.<br /><br />In the reviews, I stumbled across the revelation of the nature of the traumatic elements that appear within the book. I was very concerned about how it would be handled / if I could handle it / if I would want to handle it within the context of a New-Adult romance, but I looked up a spoiler in another review to get an idea over what I would be dealing with. I was hesitant and quite concerned, but the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive, I decided to try it. For me personally, I think it helped that I was prepared for it - even then, it was devastating (as it should be).<br /><br />*** SPOILER below regarding said &#34;traumatic elements&#34; ***<br /><br />Because I had to know the nature of the &#34;traumatic elements&#34; before I committed to it, I respect that other readers might want that too, so I am providing this information so that others can choose with their eyes open. The issue of child abuse is very serious, devastating and sad. I cried through a lot of these parts, which was fine, since that is what it should be.<br />That being said, I think that the author tread very softly and when it was included, it was very sensitively done: enough to let you know what you need to know, transfer the horror but not done gratuitously or for shock-value.<br /><br />That said, had I personally experienced anything similar, I am not sure that I could read this book. (That is an impossible thing to know, but it hits hard and close, even without personal experience).<br /><br />I think that's why it really delivers 5 stars.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Love, Love, Love it.  My grandson can hold and manoever his pacifier, which in turn keeps him soothed much longer.
B0079K4WEE|5.0|You won't be able to forget this one!  If this one doesn't hold you in it's grip, you don't like to think.  The best horror tale ever.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Nice spooky graphics and good puzzles. Good flow and plays well on my Kindle Fire.  Looking forward to playing the full version.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|This is an icon of scifi movies.  A must see for anyone.  A masterpiece of special effects for it's time.  Fantastic all around.  Of course, the ending could give kids nightmares, lol.  WOW!  Love it!  You will see many actors you will recognize.
1881273873|5.0|This book really pleasantly surprised me..I gave it as a gift to my 22 year old daughter who has been with her boyfriend for over a year, and they read it together and said it really helped them better understand what makes each other 'tick', AND how to show love in ways that are appreciated and received. She immediately recommended her older sister read it, and has now loaned it out to 4 or 5 other girlfriends that are struggling with relationships and/or want to build stronger ones.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My brother and I play it every day! It really lets you use your imagination to build<br />different designs. Yes, there are ads, but they are easy to get past. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Grandson loved the movie....,funny and entertaining......Not much more to say except I would purchase product again. Great Buy and rental.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Love this series. I can't wait to start \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" but since that is the last book Martin has finished I am waiting a while to savor it.
B00AATV046|5.0|I don't know why the great old flicks are so pricey.  The newer generations would watch them more if they were more reasonable.  Of course, this is a fantastic classic.  But at least they are putting out these old gems now.<br />These old flicks are so well done, compared to modern stuff.  There is a reason why actors of that era are icons.<br />When you watch a movie like this, and your finished watching it, you get the feeling:  \\"aaahhhh.  Nice\\".
B005XLN97M|5.0|My five year old was given this Barbie house as a gift.  It was relatively easy to put together.  I'd say about 15 minutes.  It is very durable, as my 1 year old often has to mess with it!  It's a nice size without being overly bulky.  My daughter loves the stairs and the bed.  She thinks it is hilarious that there is a bathroom with a shower and a kitchen.  I'm expecting this toy to last for years in my house!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I personally thought the episodes where Eli David and Jackie was the best so far this season.  I love Ziva but I especially like it when they let her do some action scenes that show off her abilities.....that is what endeared the people to her character.  She is a fighter and fantastic actress.  I love all the characters on this show - they all mesh so well together.  Please don't mess with the characters that currently are on this show - they are what makes this show the best drama on television.
0307730697|5.0|This book was very insightful and informative.  It tells the story of Adam Brown who is a member of Seal team six.  It tells of several of the things he had to go through as a SEAL and how he came to know Christ.  I was amazed of the courage he had and have a better understanding of what the families go through.<br /><br />I received this book to review from Waterbrook Multnomah press to review.<br /><br />more from the author can be found at http://www.amazon.com/Eric-Blehm/e/B001IR1L2A/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0
B000HF6XPY|4.0|If you enjoy Conan style, swordplay, etc., this is a great flick.  I enjoyed it.  Good story.  Funny seeing \\"arnold\\" as \\"not the main character\\".  But enjoyable.
B00003CWL6|5.0|What a great flick can not believe I have only seen snipets of it on the tube.... Decide to buy this , what a great purchase ...
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|purchased for my granddaughters, they have been enjoying it very much.<br />they have been playing it every evening now for a week
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun to play and keeps me interested.  Have not played anything like it so nice diversion from free cell and Mahjongg.
B003NRWW58|5.0|I just love this series.  I was so disappointed when it just \\"tapered off\\".  Great stuff.  I think the last \\"British\\" \\"season\\", the miniseries \\"Children of Earth\\" or something like that, was just awesome.  The last effort, an American venture, was not so good, but OK.....a massive dig at phamaceutical companies.  But the first three seasons are outstanding.  Love this series.
B00000G3I2|4.0|great flick, excellent cast, though not the normal sow no explosions, no blood no guts no smashing cars etc, . Just a thought provoking introspection of life and its turnings.
B008K8U13K|5.0|my 5 year old grandson loves this game and all the sonic games, he is wanting some new ones.<br />He has mastered all the ones i have now
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Enjoy the fast paced games.  A good way not to have to think about anything at the end of theday.
B001UU0XWE|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows of all time.  Very well done and acted.  Great story.  SCIFI in a current world, so to speak.  One recurring actor is Leonard Nimoy.  John Noble and the others do a fantastic job as multiple characters in some seasons.  Amazing people.  You should really watch season one befor getting into the later seasons.  Writers are genius.
0767810856|5.0|A really fine movie, the interaction between Brigette Fonda, and Rosie Perez really good. Nicholas Cage really good as usual. Heart warming, unusual film, easy to get caught up in......
1451620829|5.0|I must say this is one of the most interesting and honest autobiographies Ive ever read, if not THE most interesting. Written in a simple, street language it feels very honest and from the heart
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed the book and learned a lot about flowers. I did, however, think Victoria was not very realistic.  In the 21st century not too many teenagers would have the success that she did. Overall it was a good story and kept me interested.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I like the carbide portion of this sharpener and the compact size, but the tapered diamond rod broke on mine quite easily.  Have to downgrade the review for that since sharpening the serrated blade of a knife you use for survival purposes might be very important.  Personally, I don't buy knives with combo blades for that reason.  I like a blade I can sharpen with a minimum of hassle, if it's going to be a survival tool.
B00005JKBC|4.0|what a surprise, possibly the best movie Pitt has done, not fond of his work , but he is good in this, Redford great but when isn't he...
B005LAII08|5.0|Wonderful movie, as expected! These titles only seems to get better over time with the characters and rich story lines.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I love how much extra space there is in the container. We consolidated all our sets down to this one box.
B00441E2R8|4.0|This was a perfect gift for Christmas.  I am glad I selected.  Having purchased Swatch watches years ago, I knew exactly the quality and expectations when I ordered this watch.
B003L77G2Y|3.0|or should it be sane... Really going out there to the point of no return... interaction amongst cast is getting really good but strange story line
B003M5AXN4|5.0|This move is one of my favourites.  The visual choreography is beyond amazing.  Hands down my favourite racing movie.  I wasn't a fan of the original anime and I'm still not but this movie is great.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is just about the only app I use it is very useful it's just awesome. The ads are a bit annoying but I can ignore them
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|My car has an IPOD dock in the center console. According to the documentation their is an AUX input for the radio but getting to it would require ripping half the dash apart. This was a simple and quick fix. I connected this to my I pod dock and the HTC Bluetooth adapter to it using a $3 coupler I picked up at Radio Shack. I did lose the ability to skip tracks using the steering wheel buttons but I would lose that with anything but an Iphone/pod anyway. My phone mounts securely to my windshield and has a 'car' mode which enables me to effortlessly go through my music options using large touch buttons or voice commands so it makes for safer driving as well. I've also used the adapter in hotel rooms that have iPod docks but no way to play music from a non apple product.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book kept me up at night. I kept waiting for something to happen, and it did, over and over again. The characters were so real to me, I felt their anguish throughout the book. My stomach was tied up in knots. The ending was a tremendous relief to me,but I still felt heartbroken for all the loss... Kathleen Grissom writes so very well, I can't wait to read her next book (after I get some sleep)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read everything Jeffrey Archer has written and really like his style of writing.  I'm looking forward to the last book of the trilogy.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|doesn't work on my android 2.3 tablet. i will keep trying to make it work, very disappointed with this app
0374290024|5.0|Forget Jared Diamond, if you want big history Ian Morris is the one you want to read. Less emphasis on determinism and much more factually accurate his brilliant account of the world and how we got here is a must read for any one interested in history, international relations, economics or comparative studies. Plus he is an engaging writer. Even though the subject matter is dense I found this book to be an easy and downright pleasant read. A few non history/politic types have borrowed the book from me and gained a really solid foundation that should be but all to often isn't provided in HS/College world civ classes.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch is quality made and sturdy and best of all, it doesn't need batteries to mess with.  Keeps perfect time and is quite stylish.  Definitely not a cheap looking watch.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Having read all of Philippa Gregory's books, I must say I found this very enjoyable.  I have a particular interest in reading about the &#34;royals&#34; past and present.
B0000DZ3EN|1.0|Received first copy....had glitches! So replacement....guess what glitches in the movie again! One of my fav movies but wanna copy with no glitches!
0199206589|2.0|About halfway through this short book I started to grow frustrated with Mr. Dodds' ceaseless fascination with the George W. Bush Administration. Rather then providing an introduction to the subject the book seemed at times like rehash of the Huffington Post circa 2006. Any one who lived through these years with their eyes somewhat open doesn't need to be beaten over the head with the failures and missteps that were blindingly obvious to most people who would be buying this book in the first place. George W. Bush appears more times in the index then any other term, often taking up 3-4 pages at a time, of what is supposed to be a very short book. As a result the book feels dated even though the topic it supposedly covers is timeless. The book didn't enrich my understanding of geopolitics at all.
B007SGM084|1.0|maybe if she had stopped with the 2nd book it would have been ok, still not great by any means. horribly written (if i read \\"reverie\\" or \\"finds his release\\" one more time. . .). worth no more than a little shock value
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I highly recommend this app. I love the fact that it tells you how  much time you have for specific tasks. I like that it gives actual time left so you are not caught away from your charging source in the middle of a good book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A &#34;fair&#34; Grisham who, like his contemporaries, is running a book mill. I may have to revert to classics for learning and entertainment
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this book in high school and still really enjoy it and now i can read it whenever i want.
B005LAII12|5.0|love the movie and it is a great gift also. we got this one for my youngest bro in law and he loves it too
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It has lots of action in it but also insight into the character's thinking.<br />We are getting to know Jamie Lanister.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This is a coffee table type of book. Something that you can just grab and read for a while to chill out and relax.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a very creative book. Would recommend this to anyone with a big imagination and who can think outside the box.
0765325950|5.0|For the most part I was incredibly satisfied. It was brilliant! Thank-you Brandon Sanderson for finishing this story for us. It is so bittersweet to end a well loved series.<br /><br />The book resolves all major story lines and some of the minor ones too. It ends in a way that feels very true to the series. I was glad for the references to earlier events in the series, especially from the Eye of the World. As others have said, the book is just one massive battle which is what is to be expected for the final battle. I would have been disappointed if we had a book full of characters talking. The Forsaken are all amazing. Matt felt more like himself than any book since Jordan passed away. Rand also feels more like he did in the first few books than the last few. The ending was written by Robert Jordan and was a brief and abrupt ending that many (including me)wish had been fleshed out more but Brandon and Team Jordan stayed true to the ending. I liked the ending. It was not the end but an end.<br /><br />Some of my favorites are: The Last Battle was so realistic it totally absorbed me. It was emotionally exhausting to read. Tam and Rand were together a last time.  Olver got a starring role. Egwene was breathtaking. Matt kicked ASS! Lan gave me two heart in my throat moments. Perrin had Rand's back no matter the cost. Logain does the right thing. Demandred was pretty damn awesome. Ogier were killing machines. Rand and his pipe.<br /><br />Some things I didn't like: Why is Fain even in this book? I wanted someone to muzzle Damandred. I got so tired of Slayer. A few plots could have used more explanation.<br /><br />A Memory of Light had flaws carried over from other books in the series.  Jordan opened and never closed way too many plot points that were not necessary to the finale of the series. AMOL closed a lot of these open plot points, many in a trivial and inconsequential manner. I believe that all of the major plot points were dealt with satisfactorily. An example of a minor plot point is Padin Fain who did not need to be in the final battle and indeed did little before his demise.<br /><br />Many fans love this series because of the intense and complex character stories and these fans would have preferred more character interaction and less battle. I am one of the fans who wanted the Final Battle and didn't need more character development or even interaction, except perhaps the ending could have benefited from some major POV character insight. I know former soldiers who loved the long intense battle and thought it very well done. Even without military experience, I thought the Final Battle was well strategized and it sucked me totally in. It was a battle to fit the end of the turning of the wheel.<br /><br />There will always be those who want to nitpick because Brandon Sanderson is not identical to Robert Jordan. I didn't read the story trying to figure out what each author contributed but some did. It was Harriet's job to meld Sanderson's words into a closer approximation of RJ and I think she did an excellent job and as a result we have been blessed to have this exquisite ending.<br /><br />Yes there were characters that I wished had more presence, a few scenes that were boring, and a couple of contemporary words that made me pause, but not enough to detract from the story. I'm very grateful to Brandon and Harriet for dedicating themselves to finishing RJ's life work and for doing so with integrity. I so very much wish we had the opportunity to see what the new age brings to all of the survivors, but at least we know it will start a lot better than the last age.<br /><br />I am an e book reader too but I think it is incredibly immature to give a 1 star review to a hardcover book that you have not read because you only want to read it in digital format.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Not worth my time, it went on and on and never really ended. The characters were well developed but I disliked the, all
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story just really had me hooked from the first page.  It's the type of drama/ love story that pulls are your heart and aches right along with the story!!!! So GOOD, love Colleen Hoover
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had this on my old phone and now having it on my kindle EVERYONE wants to play!! This is fun for the whole family and is really a strategy game.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I like watching QVC, so this makes it even easier.  Can take it with me.  Easy to find what you're looking for
B0018BF1J0|5.0|Here you go.....the first 5ive LouReed records (some with bonus tracks) packaged up quite nicely.....picks up from when Lou left VelvetUnderGround.....a 5ive record package at a very affordable price.....this is actually a 'steal' for any Lou fan.....
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I love this game any agry birds game is awesome  this is addictive so whatch out  you may never stop
B0063GORYU|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite games. I really enjoy that it makes me think about my next move.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app was put on for my grandkids.  They say they really like to play and is fun.  They play it all the time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|fabulous for home, hair, health, and school....and everything in between and WAY OUT THERE! Almost everything you would want to keep together, whatever you can't find here, you can make your own pin for!
B00933JF74|4.0|This game is not for everyone, but it's probably one of the best games on the kindle fire. The feeling of accomplishment you get when a town is set up just the way you want it is great.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|electronic uno is so much fun. it's so much fun you still get to play with other people but no one gets to cheat.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This again is for my grandkids.  They asked me to put it on for them.  They love it.  It's fun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase and the pricing of the bok.  It was a real page turner.  Some parts were poorly written but overall very happy with the story.  Can't wait for the movie! Hoping they pick the guy who played Thor to play Christian and a fresh face and unknown actress to play Anastasia.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I love everything he does, but I could do with out the country from John Meyer.  Everything else on the CD is great....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm so happy that none of the good characters died in this story!! I'm happy in the way it ended and excited to see the movie when it comes out!
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Killer Cupcakes is one of those mysteries that is light and fluffy with a not so sophisticated whodunit.  The book had all the right ingredients but I had to drop it a star because of its shortcomings in delivery.  Lexy is your typical type of protagonist: adorably cute, can eat anything she wants, has a spunky sidekick, sassy grandmother, and a hot detective love interest. All the makings of a charming breezy mystery- just be advised that although entertaining you are not going to find anything too original and you are not going to be scratching your head in puzzlement over who is the killer. I did like it however and look forward to reading Dying for Danish (the next book in the series).  Not the best cupcake but still yummy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase and the pricing of the bok.  It was a real page turner.  Some parts were poorly written but overall very happy with the story.

B00723NWJE|5.0|I have all of her CD's and can't wait for her to do another...Love her voice, I hope she keeps putting them out
B00936A0RU|5.0|Great movie, good casting, believeable characters, good scenery, GREAT COLOR.  very period appropriate. a good fun watch, as always, made me think I would have been a good bootlegger.
B000002A47|5.0|I have all of her CD's and this is one that I love to listen to at Christmastime.  If you are a Mariah fan, pick this up.
B003GYEGNO|5.0|Great read i I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I don't know that the exhaustive description of various fashions in the story added much.
B001R22TBI|5.0|I have every CD she has made,,,I also have turned many people on the this artist....as none of m,y friends had heard of her so I am waiting for the next CD
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Bought the trilogy for my grandson who looked surprised and excited when he unwrapped his Christmas present!  I am sure him and his mom will enjoy watching them.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|i love this cd, bruno mars is great!i would definately recommend this cd to everyone.  great music and a great sound
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I love the series and this one did not disappoint. It has romance, action and adventure. I could not put it down.
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|I saw John in concert and was amased ,,,this man can play the gutar ,,,, I did not know how good he really is ,,,,in concert you become much more aware of these skills when you see him live...DON'T MISS
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I have no idea why this movie has such a high rating. Me and my husband were very disappointed. So if you want to introduce your kid to depression this is very good way to do.
B0086700CM|5.0|you literally go into the game... real stress buster... enjoy the game... simple creative game for all ages... go on
B008BD9SI8|3.0|This did not come close to the First Law Trilogy. It got quite disjointed in the middle and that frustrated me a bit. Still a roaring good read, but not his best.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|This is a bit different from regular songs from her but I enjoy ,,,listen to ofter and really enjoy the cd.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm speechless, this book is incredible I never wanted it to end. 5 stars in my eyes. Nicholas Sparks you have a true gift!
1608871045|5.0|This book arrived really fast. It's GREAT! I love it. All the details, maps, cards, etc. are really cool. I bought this as a present for someone and will probably buy another one for myself. :)
B0087GYY92|5.0|Yhis book definitely resonates with me, seeing as I love Star Trek. It is funny, smart, thoughtful and well written. Scalzi is a master.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|This is one of my favorite groups,,,,Love her voice and her energy....cant't wait for next CD to come out I hope it is soon....I am hooked.
0143122010|5.0|I have enjoyed both how the brain works and the blank slate-- but I think this is Pinker's best.  I recommend this book to all the people that think the world is getting worse and \\"we're doomed\\". This book gives hope based on facts-- not beliefs. If you're tired of the quick solution, the easy answer and you're ready for complex answers to complex questions then this book is for you. I also recommend this book to people still trying to make some sense of world after Newtown. There is hope for the human race.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|the first two movies are the reason I bought this, and I wasn't disappointed, specifically the Richard Donner cut of two, and Having commentary for that version and the 2000 cut of 1 from Donner himself was great.<br />as well as the classic cartoons from the 40's, they could have been handled better, and I would hope for a remastering of those at some point in the future, but I have to imagine that would be expensive to do with a public domain property like that, so I'm not disappointed.
B007I1QUYE|1.0|Good fun movies and nice compilation but... Spiderman 2 and 3 do not offer any audio or subtitles in spanish. If like myself you need them, then don't buy this version. Look for each one individually for a version that has at least subtitles.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I love this band,,,I can't wait for the next CD I will order as soon as I see there is a new one,  I don't even listen to and songs as I know I will enjoy anything they do.......
B004ZNANZA|5.0|great cd! i loved the extra songs on the 3rd disc. worth every penny! it is an experience every pink floyd fan should have!
B006TVQTHW|5.0|This case has great airflow and a clean basic look. No frills to this update (original is Antec Three Hundred). The HDDs load from the side of the case now instead of from the motherboard side like the original. It makes for easy drive install without having to pull your vid card out. Lots of room inside and comes with pre-installed fans (1 in top and 1 in back) with sliding controls for the fans speed. Very happy with this case. Would definitely buy another if need be. I personally prefer the non-fancy flat black look w/o all the fancy LEDs and see-through side panels so this worked perfect for me.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The Language of Flowers was a very fastinating story of a young woman on her own after a difficult childhood of foster parents and group homes.  It includes her story of mental adjustments and learning to love.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The half a dozen times that I have used splashtop Remote, I wish that I had a different kind of A I wish that I had a different kind of Android device, like the Galaxy Note 2 and a lot a remote connection sucks that I could use this more often because it really is quite a powerful application.    Don't get me wrong, using this app on the Samsung Galaxy S3 isn't bad. Usually I use it to access files on my home pc...  Here is what I mean: [...]
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the first book. Can't wait to watch the movie and read the third book. I just hope they don't edit out all the good parts like they did for the hunger games.
B009VLX8FS|1.0|seriously, this is horrible. It's made for a bunch of teens who love pop music.<br /><br />Lyrics are horrible. She is not even trying to rhyme or have any lyrical flow. Instrumentation sounds like it is all computer. And to top it all off, she can't sing.<br /><br />I like real music and artists, and follow all genres of music. I really did try to give this album a try, but it was painful. Her hype is what is carrying her.<br /><br />Save your money and buy something worth listening to from a real artist.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I would recommend this product, the display is nice and large on the Kindle and works great for a calculator.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Have not started this yet. but look forward to a snow day and a cup of hot tea. easy to downlaod
B0076DELIG|5.0|Loved this tightly written and exciting thriller! Harry Bosch's investigative skills and dogged determination win the day and another case is solved.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my 6 year old. She LOVES this movie! My 12 year old and 15 year old enjoyed it too!
B005LAII12|5.0|Very fair priced DVD.  Was mailed very quickly, especially with the holidays and packaged carefully.  No complaints here!  Great movie, but if you haven't seen it...don't let the teddy bear fool you.  This movie isn't meant for the kiddies :)
B003VANOFY|2.0|This is my second G930 headset...the first one I had to return within the first week because it would not charge. I've owned this headset for 5 months, and I'm hoping to find a better, more reliable alternative.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- G keys are extremely cool and useful. I play a lot of audio books and podcasts and I configure one of the buttons to play/pause which is quite handy for walking around the house.<br />- Comfortable. I regularly wear these for 1+ hour without issue<br />- Noise Cancellation...the headphones fit over your ears and drowns out the rest of the world. You can wear these instead of earplugs ;-)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- It randomly has issues with disconnects...just drops audio randomly even while plugged in. This usually happens to me once or twice a day<br />- After some time, a loud buzzing noise starts occurring in my headphones that is louder than the music I'm listening to. This might just be a defect in my headphones, but its really annoying that I'll need to return yet another headset.<br />- Software does not report battery status while the headphones are powered off and plugged in.<br />- Mic does not have any background noise cancellation which seems odd for a product in this price range.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I bought this for my mom and she loved it. It arrived two days early too. She was very pleased.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Bought as a gift for my daughter because she loves the show. She has thoroughly enjoyed this! Will purchase future series as well !
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Better than the second one, not as good as the first. Probably as good as the third?  The monkey was a bit on the mean and evil side, maybe too evil for some.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this game so I decided to try it out ...and now I see that this is an INCREDIBLE GAME...FUN..GRAPHICS VERY GOOD..2 THUMBS UP
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey was a moving experience from start to finish. The environments drive emotion not unlike high art. Every aspect of the game makes it a worthwhile purchase. Gamer or artist, you deserve to pick this up and give it three hours of your life.<br /><br />It is also great to have the other two big title Thatgamecompany games on the disk as well. Haven't gotten around to playing them yet though.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Bought as a gift for my daughter because she loves the show. She has thoroughly enjoyed this! Will purchase future series as well !
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was an awesome book. It kept me reading until the very last page. Me being a high school student, I'm obviously not a big fan of reading. But I absolutely loved this book and hope to read more by him.
B002ZBRSIY|5.0|This movie was a hit from the get go!!!! Love all of them. The movie show what real friendship means. Still thinks that GC & MD are the best.
B000VYX8PE|3.0|I enjoyed this book. It wasn't quite the dark adventure I was hoping for, but I like the way it introduces vocabulary and idioms, with a definition. However, this did change the character of the book for me, making me feel like it was more appropriate for younger readers. I'm going to read the next few books and consider enjoying it with my class.<br /><br />The Baudelaire children are very bright, but tragedy takes their parents, home, and possessions from them. They are sent across town to live with Count Olaf, a very distant relative who wants nothing more than to have the children's fortune. Nothing of measurable happens to these children, who go through terrible trials and, in the end, have a happy ending snatched from them.
B000003CMB|3.0|Some of the recordings, I thought were long in length. I was expecting two disc instead of just one but, it a great CD
B0098XY5VK|4.0|Very good game actual version costs 1.00 and its somewhat short<br />But it's a awesome game I recommend this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. Addicting!! Can't get enough subway surfers, always riding trains and jumping barriers. Collecting mad amounts of coins an  jetpack!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works on multiple platforms and syncs to the cloud! I use it everywhere; home, work, travelling, etc. Great for capturing short notes or writing novels!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Bought this to have in our library.  Ordered season 3 and am awaiting its arrival.  Love to have the set to watch in the at our leisure.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|I was a great gift for my wife for Christmas.  She had the album but did not have the cd.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I first played this game on my phone, but now I play on kindle. Easy mind drain and game of strategy. Just wish it wasn't always tring to post to fb
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read that has a surprising twist to it.  It really does show how powerful the mind and heart are.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Bought this as a last minute Christmas gift and it shipped quickly and arrived on time.  Big Bang, never dissapoints!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I much prefer the pre-Eliminator music from the 'Top.  This album takes me back to those days.<br /><br />I'd sure like to know what the 'lighters on the dresser' lyric means...
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Never read a book by a dog before! It kept my interest throughout the story. I read it because it was my book club pick
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Our boy is a little over 2 years old.  We bought this truck for Christmas.  It was one of a couple of presents.  Once he opened it, he wanted to play only with the truck.  He loves loading the truck up with his other cars and toys.  He also likes to put his action figures on the front seat and close the door.  I took one star off for durability because the little silver piece on top of the front window, keeps falling off.  Our boy also keeps taking off one of the side doors, but it's easy to re-attach so no big deal.  We're definitely thinking about getting another Bruder for him next Christmas.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a great book with a good twist. I found myself actually afraid during some scenes. I recommend it!
0345803507|3.0|By the third book, I was over it. I read the first two quickly and then by the third, the dynamic between the two main characters became boring. It was the same thing back and forth between them. They are quite annoying at this point and I'm actually having trouble finishing it. I'm hoping I'll get back to reading it sometime soon but I doubt that will happen.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I had to find out how it would end. Did he or didn't he? Very good ending. I recommended it for my book club selection. It gave us a lot to talk about.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've listened to the Piano Guys since they released \\"Love Story meets Viva La Vida\\" so I was really excited to see that they were able to release a whole album. It was, by far, my favorite Christmas present this year. The music is interesting enough that one can sit and actively listen to it, but it also makes great music for relaxing, reading, or writing to. The only way you could be disappointed is if you didn't get it.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|my niece loved ti and has watched it multiple times already - she wanted to do this review herself but couldn't
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Guess there is something for everyone, but a bit over the edge for sure...An open mind is necessary but give me a mystery that is more enjoyable...Whatever.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|The classical music from the book. If you love classical music you will love this album. I just wanted to hear the music mentioned in the book, and it is great. Thanks,
B00973902K|5.0|I love this song, and was glad to get it in this format.  Purchasing was easy.  I will do it again.
B000002NHN|5.0|I was introduced to this artist some years ago, and I've always enjoyed her music since that time. This was purchased as a gift.<br />The seller shipped the CD promptly. I'd gladly do business with them again.<br />Thanks!
B00122HPDU|5.0|Great album to enjoy the greatest of Buble' . There is always a mood to listen to his songs. Great
1400163439|2.0|Not a very good read, however, good look into the rare book collectors mentality. I  Wouldn't recommend this book unless you are very interested in collectors.
B001A5HBAG|4.0|I like this show. Don't know how accurate at all it is, but the characters are very interesting and well-developed. It's nice that Amazon has such an easy way to view shows instantly.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved Safe Haven! Nicolas Sparks did it again <3  his way of writing in fabulous! Every book he writes is fantastic in its own unique way.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Does all I think it should. Doesn't crash. Couldn't ask more from a solitaire app. Like how it has separate tracking for single draw play and three draw play.

B001NHNG64|3.0|Don't. Know that I would recommend.<br />To anyone .  I quit half way through  Too much background, discursive info.  Just wanted to say, Let us please get on with the plot!
B000A6CLL0|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband as he is a true fan of the genre and this show in particular.<br />The packaging is fantastic.  There are many bonus features on the show including deleted scenes as well as interviews with the cast.  Amazon had the best price; I searched many sites for availability and price.  Not need to waste time with that.  Just buy it here on Amazon.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Why must they have tasks come up where you have to pay cash to finish them? Buying a peacock or a black cat costs cash and I only have coins. Those tasks will never get done. Energy takes forever to refill. Only 20 per hour. Ridiculous.
B004HO6I2E|3.0|although there were some pretty funny scene's in the movie, it fell short of what I expected from the trailers.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was so excited to jump in to a revolutionary kind of sexy book for us oldies but goodies...what a disappointment...it was not the steamy book I thought it would be.
0345803485|5.0|loved the book. and loved how fast this book came was very good purchase and good price the book made you want the next 2 right away
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great movie and an even better book. I am waiting anxiously for the next instalment of the trilogy.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Except the 8th one I didn't like that one. But it was a great series doesn't do the books justice but still worth the 80 bucks I paid of course I think its running at costco for 50 now so maybe I should have waited but it was a good birthday present
B00AMBH70S|3.0|the movie was not thrilling enough for me. i really enjoyed the original 1st 3 bourne movies this one storyline just didnt cut it.
1609611543|4.0|I would like to recomend Wheat Belly to whoever has a problem with a bigger belly than you should have or that is healthy for you. My belly is shrinking and have lost 10lbs. inthe first week.
0670023329|5.0|Watched a segment on 60 minutes about this.  The book was excellent and difficult to put down!  I highly recommend it.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Most comedy shows you have to wade through the first season until they find their ground but with this show the pilot episode is amazing and there has only been one episode in the entire life of the show where I didn't laugh multiple times.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|I gave it four because the case was broken on the bottom. Other than that, everything else was fine. It arrived quickly and the DVD works perfectly.

1936608898|3.0|I have no issues with this book's mission or information, and admire the Whole30 program and all it stands for. I guess I was hoping to be blown away by the book, and then slightly disappointed that there wasn't much I hadn't already read or encountered elsewhere (as a previous reviewer mentioned, courtesy of Mark Sisson, Robb Wolf, not to forget Diane Sanfilippo and Chris Kresser).<br /><br />If you are new to the lifestyle, or considering embarking on a Whole30 and want a guide that pretty much sums up the dos and don'ts, plus the science behind it: have at it. But if you're pretty savvy on the subject already, I don't think this one is a must-have. There are not many recipes and quite a bit of personal anecdotes from Dallas and Melissa.<br /><br />The book that really inspired me to take the plunge and go primal was Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint, and it's still the tome I would recommend most highly for someone just dipping their toes in the water.

1440503257|3.0|We are Harry Potter obsessed. I have read the books 2-3 times, and we just finished reading them as a family. The kids have both been characters for Halloween, have every Lego set and cannot wait until they get to go to the theme park in Florida.<br /><br />My daughter even had a Harry Potter themed-birthday brunch for her 8th, where we made potions and I adapted a couple of recipes from this cookbook. Should have been perfect, right? Well, here's the rub. The cookbook is interesting to flip through, and some of the recipes are creative and great. The apple pie ice cream is delicious, as are some of the baked goods. It's unofficial but does aim to be authentic, so it's to be expected that some of the fare won't be the most fun or necessarily kid-friendly.<br /><br />We were all disappointed, though, that the book didn't include a single photo of a prepared dish, or even any engaging drawings. It definitely isn't overly visually appealing, which is such a shame considering Harry Potter is all about magic. I would also agree with some earlier reviews that some of the recipes are really not recipes at all. I know how to cook bacon, and really wanted to have more inspiration and fun with ways to concoct butter beer (not in the cookbook) or whip up some mind-blowing pumpkin pasties. Both of my kids enjoyed flipping through this, but I just feel it fell short of its potential.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Ouch!<br /><br />I mean it. Ouch! There are not many things I read that cause me to have a physical reaction, but \\"The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win\\" did just that. It felt like a punch in the gut. I started sweating, I felt like I was going to throw up. And if you have ever worked in an IT shop with big problems you may have the same visceral reaction I had. Authors Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford definitely know what they are writing about.<br /><br />You know it's going to be a good story when it begins with our hero, Bill, being summoned to HR to be told that the CIO and VP of IT Operations are no longer with the company. And when our hero tries to do anything he can to get out of accepting his promotion to VP of IT Operations you know it's going to be a REALLY good story. Suffice it to say things get a lot worse before they start to get better.<br /><br />The cast of characters, although somewhat stereotyped, is one that anyone in IT will find familiar. From Mr. Wisecrack to Ms. Scheming Marketing VP, to the security and compliance guy who makes sure operations grind to a halt--we have known them all. The next six months are devastating for some, transformative for others. Our hero is guided along the way by a mysterious Yoda-like management consultant in a tee-shirt who teaches Bill to re-imagine himself and the role of IT in an organization.<br /><br />And that's the real message of this book. This is not just a compelling story of an IT nightmare, it's an instruction book for change. The story leads us down the path of the Three Ways into an understanding of DevOps. The true mission is \\"to show how IT can regain the trust of the business and end decades of intertribal warfare.\\" Can this actually happen for us out here in the real world? Only if we read this book and try.

He goes back to his old hard rock stomping ground with Crazy Horse and plays some contemporary, yet timeless music.  The blu-ray audio version is the one to get if you want the best sound quality available.
B005HSGB6W|1.0|I appreciate a difficult read. I appreciate fiction from different countries, cultures, and times. I appreciate not trusting the government. I can even appreciate poorly written books IF the story is powerful. This &#34;book&#34; was the worst of all of these statements. The slang was difficult for difficulties sake.  The message of the government was heavy handed. The pity for the protagonist was feeble. The overall message was poorly crafted and framed more as a statement than a thought provoking question. I can't remember ever rating something 1 star, but I want the time i spent reading this back. It was truly horrible.

B006RXQ2CY|4.0|The words that spring to mind when I think of this film are \\"beautifully understated.\\" That description is apt in describing Helen's Mirren's stellar portrayal of Elizabeth II, as well.<br /><br />Viewing this film as a born-and-bred American, I came away from it viewing the monarchy with new, sympathetic eyes. This isn't to say I'm now pro-monarchy...there's a scene toward the beginning of the film that's utterly priceless, where Tony Blair gets down on one knee while the Queen invites him to set up a government in her name. Michael Sheen played that scene with just the right amount of embarrassment: he looked chagrined, and like he felt like a fool, and he was right to feel that way because it looked utterly ridiculous, something so out-of-place in our time. But as the film progressed, I, like the Tony Blair character, began to have a reluctant admiration for the queen even when I disagreed with her and all she stood for. After all, this is a woman whose formative years took place during WWII, a time when \\"keep calm and carry on\\" was her nation's mantra. I got the sense that she wasn't cold-hearted so much as a hopeless product of her time...a time that is long past.<br /><br />I even felt sympathy for Prince Charles as portrayed by Alex Jennings. I got the sense that his sorrow over the loss of his sons' mother was enhanced by his guilt over his treatment of her, which made him a bit more likeable for me. (That said, I still despise the real Charles for being such a weakling as to let his mother pressure him into leaving the woman he truly loved and marrying a woman he didn't love, an innocent, inexperienced, overly emotional and highly strung young girl with whom he had nothing in common but a pedigree - and then behaving like a dog after he did marry her instead of committing to the marriage.) The director's decision to not have William and Harry be portrayed onscreen was a sensitive and wise one, I think.<br /><br />My husband is fond of saying that everyone is a package, made up of good and bad parts. I was reminded of that watching this film...many people tend to vilify either Charles or Diana or the Royal family in general, when the truth is that, like most families, each of them made some pretty horrific mistakes and did some stupid things, sometimes with the best intentions, sometimes for personal gain.<br /><br />Beautifully acted, beautifully directed, beautifully written...and all-around great character study and portrayal of cross-generational conflicts.<br /><br />J.W.

B007EECSFA|5.0|A captivating story of the many different kinds of loves one experiences in a lifetime. The love of places, friends, lovers, spouses, children and the chances one will take to protect those loves. It is also a tale of secrets. From the beginning the reader is led to believe they have these secrets figured out, but each chapter takes you in a different direction. It is not until the surprising final chapter that the entire remarkable lives of all the characters come together. An exceptionally satisfying read!
B009E3EY38|2.0|Jimmy Page didn't have it this night -- he was downright awful.  Robert Plant wasn't bad, I suppose.  John Paul Jones did as well as he could.  But then Jason Bonham was really good.  Put it all together and it's a forgettable performance.  No need for me to ever hear it again.  This is not how Led Zeppelin should be remembered -- this is Las Vegas Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />It's no exaggeration to say Jimmy Page was awful; that much is clear from the very beginning of the record.  From the first time he tries to play a single-note riff, which, on this record, is the one from 'Good Times, Bad Times,' he muffs it.  He doesn't play it cleanly once, and it gets no better than that for the rest of the night.  His tone is over-loud and too high in the mix.  His timing is terrible.  During the verses of of 'Ramble On,' it's clear that he and the rest of the band are playing to two different metronomes that only they can hear.  He completely bricks the final bar of the classic 'Stairway to Heaven' solo, which every guitar player (and everybody else, for that matter) knows.  It's this bar: the repeated C-A-E triplet pull-off riff ending with the bend up to D.  But not once does he play this riff right.  Somehow, he misses the pull-off to A every time.  Inexcusable.<br /><br />John Paul Jones apparently didn't want to be heard.  His tone consists of low-rumble bass and maybe some highs -- no mids, no distortion, no meat.  He's buried in this mix and his performance can't really add much.<br /><br />Plant does OK.  He's getting on in years though and so every song is tuned down a whole step to accommodate his shrinking vocal range.  And even then he sings some parts an octave lower.  If you've got perfect pitch, hearing these songs in a different key may grate on you.<br /><br />Which leaves us with Jason Bonham: the best one in the group.  Dead-on accurate timing, good technique, good drum tones, followed the complicated arrangements competently.  It's not an misstatement to say that he's too good for this band.  You wouldn't put Steve Gadd in The Rolling Stones; putting Jason Bonham in Zeppelin gives you about the same results.  Like mixing Blue Label with Red Barrel.

B00782O7IY|4.0|Let's pretend for the sake of argument that THE ARTIST is not a \\"silent\\" movie and just ask \\"Is THE ARTIST\\" an entertaining movie?  I was entertained very much.  It's mainly a love story but it also focuses on a man's difficulty in accepting inevitable change, in this case the transition from silent films to talkies.  His insecurity in doubting his fans willingness to accept him in talkies.  The film is also a loving homage to a Hollywood of long ago.<br />It's really not a \\"silent\\" movie since the film's musical score is such a marvelous asset to THE ARTIST.<br />The cast is very good utilizing their physicalities to involve the audience.  Jean Dujardin won an Oscar for his role as George Valentin but Berenice Bejo is equally impressive as the spirited Peppy.  James Cromwell, John Goodman. Penelope Ann Miller and Missi Pyles lend admirable support.<br />While THE ARTIST is a bold venture in today's technically dominated cinema, I don't envision a massive output of silent movies.  Think of all the great voices and lines that have been indelibly etched into our minds that we never would have experienced without sound.  So enjoy THE ARTIST for its unique presence in modern filmmaking but also continue to appreciate the amazing progress film has achieved.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I think the  best way to use this calendar is as a way to nicely display your google calendar, and also display tasks. Google  will allow you to set up repeatable events  easily (I read a review where  someone said this app has difficulties  with setting  them up). You can also display tasks nicely which I don't see in google's calendar app. .  I like the two week display calendar refill.  Also capability to choose a selection of colors and a background image with variable transparency makes this calender app personalized.  Nice app!
B006SAR6P8|3.0|After Vol 1, this is a poor sequel. I really was looking forward to this, the follow up and the tie up of the loose ends from Vol 1. There was very little action, to much blah blah blah soul searching etc, for me. The only real satisfaction I got, was she got her revenge with Bill, and the ending was quite nice, reuniting with her daughter. The acting was excellent, as one would expect from name actors like David Carradine, Uma Thurman, and Daryl Hannah etc which saved it for me. I was expecting a lot more, and unfortunately it didn't deliver
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Dark Shadows had an encouraging beginning. It was tongue-in-cheek, the outdoor scenes depicting Collinsport were as I had imagined so many years earlier. Even the actors were well cast and played their roles well. But about two thirds through, the whole film fell apart. The plot became totally senseless. Actors were no longer in character. There were endless scenes of special effects for no good reason. Any remaining humor was superfluous slapstick, and even the ending was open to interpretation, if there was anything left to interpret at that point. Avoid this one like the plague.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Husbands can enjoy watching this series with their wives. It is set in interesting historical times, including WWI and the aftermath. Social class issues and interesting characters keep it engaging as well.
0345803485|1.0|To say there are no redeeming qualities in this book would be an understatement.  This is not a book; it is a travesty, an ugly blot on the face of fiction.  The author seems to have a perverse need to abuse the English language and trick readers into believing this is actually a valuable way to spend their time.  The people who let this book go to print are a disgrace to the publishing business, and the amount of people who are gobbling it all up blithely just demonstrate how low we have fallen.<br /><br />The author has admitted that the book isn't very well-written, but why on earth did she let it be published?  Is there no shame left in the world?  Moreover, did anyone at the publishing company actually read through the whole book or just glance at the synopsis?  The amount of times the same exclamations or verbs (\\"Oh my!\\" \\"Holy crap!\\" \\"Jeez!\\"  and 'mutter', 'murmur', 'whisper', etc) were repeated throughout the book was jarring and created a bad impression for both the author and the main character, Anastasia Steele.<br /><br />Furthermore, where did E.L. James manage to find a 27-year-old man who alternates between crude sexual statements and 19th century gobbledegook?  E.L. James could have at least opened a thesaurus or learned how young people in their twenties actually speak and think.<br /><br />I thought I had met the most unlikeable and appalling characters ever created when I encountered the abomination that is 'Twilight', but I can't believe I was wrong!  I was genuinely disturbed by Christian Grey's behaviour and attitude towards Ana.  He is clearly not all there upstairs, hell-bent on getting his own way, and has an alarming penchant for stalking and tracking her down.  Put it all together and you get a dangerous, psychopathic monster.  Somehow, legions of women all around the world do not end up seeing this, and that's probably the scariest thing of the whole situation.<br /><br />As for Ana herself, crikey!  That girl is more spineless and brainless than a microscopic sea slug on the bottom of the ocean floor!  I know from experience that a higher education past high school does not necessarily guarantee a highly intelligent being, and such is the case with Ana.  Anything she would've learned about feminism and independence went straight out the window when she met Mr Considerable Length.  It's not about burning bras or telling men to stick it with their opening doors and helping women out of cars etc.  It's about being able to assert yourself and throw off control by others; stand on your own two feet and feel free.<br /><br />Ana is anything but free.  If a man gives you a contract to sign before you can be together - moreover, a contract that describes you as that man's possession to do with whatever he wants, whenever he wants - surely it's got to detonate an atomic bomb worth of alarm bells in your head, right?  Surely it will send you sprinting in the opposite direction from that man?  To be honest, for some time throughout the book, I half-expected Ana to shout, \\"Gotcha!\\" and expose Christian Grey for the oppressive, exploitative stalker that he is and send the contract to a magazine or newspaper or something and SUE HIS ASS!!!<br /><br />Instead I had to endure hundreds of pages of absolute drivel about how hot he is and how obsessed she is with him.  Doesn't she get a bit sick of all the sex?  Every time she opens her mouth to start a conversation, he orders her to spread her legs, and plunges in!  She should've realised from the very beginning that she could never have a \\"normal\\" relationship with the guy if he tried to shut her up with sex whenever she questioned him or his behaviour.<br /><br />Also, what is up with all those orgasms on demand?  He looks at her - she comes.  He says her name - she comes.  If only everything in life were that easy and simple!  He basically turns her into a sex slave and she's only too happy to oblige, under the impression that it will make him a better, happier person!  Uh, WHAT?!?!  You can't bang your problems away!  Sex is not a form of therapy yet undiscovered, no matter what your chiselled, gorgeous, millionaire boyfriend says!<br /><br />I am sorry that I ever read this book, sorry that I wasted my time on it, and I just hope that all the 5 star reviews won't sway more people into reading this monstrosity of a series.  I feel so embarrassed that this series is on the bestseller lists in so many places and that droves of people are saying it's the best thing they've ever encountered; embarrassed because I'm a part of the same human race which perpetrates these crimes on the literature world so gleefully.<br /><br />Please, if you want to keep your brain cells intact, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!  It is a gigantic waste of time.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I downloaded this game when it came out and loved it.  Everything was going well until around the 16 January when popup ads began appearing for Angry Birds merchandise.  The game is free so I have no problem with the idea of ads, but the popups appeared during game play and would freeze the game.<br /><br />Then the worst possible thing happened. A popup appeared and the game froze and I coudnt get out.  Then my phone rebooted.  And then did it again. I found I was stuck in the dreaded boot loop.  Nothing I tried seemed to work until I performed a factory reset.  I had to redo all of my settings on the phone except for the ones associated with my google account since these are automatically backed up.  This meant that all of my applications downloaded from Amazon were lost and had to be manually reinstalled.  The ones from the Play store reinstalled themselves.<br /><br />Beware of the pop up ads.
B0030U1TLQ|4.0|Interested in this at all?  You probably already know the album is great then.  It's a bit overkill with the extra discs of live music and demos, but if you are really a big fan of the Cure or just the Disintigration album, it might be worth the cost.  Liner notes are interesting on the making of the album and the package includes the original artwork from the first release of the album plus a bit more artwork added in.  The album still holds up today with its lovely dark vibe.  If you really want the full experience, listen to this album using Beats headphones.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|I think it is an exceptional book, as it reveals aspects about human behavior not commonly known by the average man in the street.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I know, I know it seems like everyone loves this book but I just couldn't. The characters seem flat and lifeless, like you've seen them in 18 thousand made for TV movies on Lifetime (not that I watch those....) Maybe it was just me but I could predict what was going on in every part of this book. It is supposed to be this crazy what is going to happen next book but it just seemed old and tired to me. If you are an avid reader I say stay away from this one. Also I won't give it away but the ending made me want to chuck this book off the plane I was on at the time and maybe I would have if I wasn't reading it on my Kindle. I can understand a book that is just easy and fun to read (I love the Jack Reacher books) but when the ending is so horribly bad and irritating like in this book it just seems to have nothing to offer except regret that I wasted my time reading it.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I chose to give this book 5 stars because I found it completely facinating. It is a bit of a long read, and I dont tend to read a lot of non-fiction, however I downloaded the preview to this book on my Kindle and HAD to buy it once I was done reading the preview.<br /><br />I would reccomend this book to anyone, and already have to my mother and a few friends.<br /><br />Enjoy Reading!
034580404X|3.0|I am still reading it but its a slow go. The writing is mediocre and amateurish at best. I dont need hard core porn but a little excitement in the writing would have been nice. Perhaps as I get further into it, the story line wont be so routine and predictable.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|The cd sounds great and it is a great selection of their career. The progression of their music is interesting.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|For $4.95, I expected more variety with the images created in each solution. In the first two levels alone, you will see 3 hearts, 3 simple houses, and at least 2 seahorses... I understand the easier levels are the tutorial, but a little creativity would be nice. In a later level you'll make Charlie Chaplin... The user interface was thought out and is ready to navigate. (Downloaded on Kindle Fire, Second Generation)
B00867GJYK|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter's 28th birthday along with 8 other Disney movies.  All blu-ray.  My daughter had an extensive collection of over 300 blu-rays, and this included most of the Disney movies.  Unfortunately; someone broke into her home while she was away and took all her blu-ray movies.  Nice of them to leave a dozen or so regular DVD movies.....<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie and vendor highly.  Thank you.
0345522478|5.0|Great story with no relationship to reality.  A really fun read.  The protaganist and other characters are well developed, engaging and easy to care about.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved the book. I enjoyed the first book and look forward to the rest! I enjoyed the 50 shades series as well
B005DN5BE4|5.0|This is a timeless classic full of real life U.S. history that speaks to us today.  If we can embrace the experience of our ancestors and apply it now, we can be freed of the mistakes of the past which our country still relives.  The drama pulls and the story stays with the viewer in a way that can be remembered for all time.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|I am really annoyed by some of the cds. I can't play some of the episodes because it says the disks are damaged.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this last year as a gift for my daughter.  She wanted one really bad.  She loves it.  However, as soon as the upgraded model came out, she wanted that one too.  Thus far, she hasn't purchased the upgraded one, as she was hoping to receive it as a Christmas gift.
B0041I0N9A|5.0|Buildability: One of the more difficult sets to build because the bags are not numbered and most are white pieces.  On the plus side, most of the bags consist of one or two like pieces so leave them in the original bags and take out pieces as needed.  This set is very impressive, when displayed it is quite large.  Also, the set may look flimsy, but it is the exact opposite; I was able to carry it around by the center wing.  My least favorite (being very picky) is the fact that you have to take the landing gear off to display it on the stand.<br /><br />Official LEGO description: The elegant Lambda-class Imperial shuttle transports the Empire's elite - and the occasional secret strike team of Rebel commandos - all across the galaxy. Now you can build this huge and iconic Star Wars vehicle in true minifigure scale for the first time ever!<br /><br />Minifigs: Darth Vader, Shuttle Pilot, Imperial Officer, Stormtrooper and Luke Skywalker.<br /><br />Value: This is probably one of my favorite sets (so far), however with the price being up there and all the pieces being mostly white, I would recommend collectors only.  As a side note, the price is equal to the brick/cost ratio.<br /><br />Overall rating: 5 stars, considering a collector is buying the set.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm usually not one for lyrics, but this album is amazing in its message.<br /><br />I'd love to shake the hands of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book of the hunger games was amazing. It was more than what I expected. Can't wait to start on the third book.
030758836X|2.0|very hard to get into. slow to start. i'm about 2/3 of the way through. it's getting better but not worth it.
B005EZJ3MW|4.0|I don't have her previous albums and I really don't buy many for a tween market until I see their work is going in the direction of something more. Being almost 30 and having bought Justin Bieber's Believe may get jokes from friends, but I see a similarity where people have potential but I wait until they have an album I think finally starts to show it. And, I also try to support people I would support well, as a person. I am no vocalist myself but I do think the singing is better and she doesn't seem to do as much oversinging or straining her voice. I do also wonder if her voice sounded different with bigger vocals before due to eating disorders (and another reason I like her is I am someone who struggled on and off almost 20 years, where even if I don't do the actions I still don't have the best self image) and how that may impact a person's voice. I think this album is her starting to tell more of her life story and I would predict the next one will be a lot more personal. I think she has the talent and drive to become an iconic figure in music and also in acting. I think it would be good to have a music video that actually shows her doing dancing since she does that well too.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because I really would only give that to albums I think are amazing and almost flawless (Like say Bad by Michael Jackson.) But as the title says, she definitely has the potential to keep improving her vocals and overall music and lyrics. I say that because she is ten years younger than me and I'm not going to bash someone who is much younger with that and I see the lyrics are better written and her voice on this cd and videos I've seen of live performances seem to be getting better (and that could also be from her being in better mental and physical health.) And again, I also bought the album to not just listen to music (since you can find the songs from most albums online) but also give support to her in record sales.
B008518MOW|5.0|5 stars because of what it is.<br />Shipped to me very fast.<br />Packaging was great.<br />love the movie.<br />Came with dvd, blue-ray dvd, and blue-ray 3D(You supply Glasses and HDTV), plus digital copy. very cool.<br />Was a gift, Perfect,  Happy receiver.<br />Thank you to seller.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book but it was a bit disturbing to develop the characters this way. Overall an enjoyable read.<br />I would recommend reading it.
1401322786|3.0|This book was not what I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be a true life story that would emphasize the need to cherish everyone in your life, and to live \\"like you were dying.\\"
1439127700|5.0|We saw this book being recommended on Morning Joe and just had to read it.  Great insights into the president's club.  Great read.  Very informative.  Very interesting.  We highly recommend this book.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This DVD exposes Larry Summers, Alan Greenspan, Henry &#34;Hank&#34; Paulson, Tim Geithner, and how they saved Goldman Sachs by bailing out AIG so that they could pay Goldman the insurance, that Goldman bet on CDOs via AIG. So the rich are not really made at the President for wanting more tax. They are happy to pay it because he allowed the crooks to save some of the rich from total financial ruin.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Stark realism and an interesting interpretation of the effects of time travel left me wondering how it would unravel...or perhaps 'ravel', in this case.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|As title says this really is the perfect battery app. Once you calibrate your device its even more accurate. No complaints will be upgrading soon just to support the dev, thank you!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased this book for my wife...she loved it!  She has recommended it to our adult daughters who have also recommended it to their girlfriends.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  I thought it did what a mystery should do; keep you guessing on how it will all end.  However, about that ending.  I was disappointed.  Was it appropriate?  Maybe, considering all that went before.  Was it satisfying?  To me, that would be a big no.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Cant get enough of Carly Rae Jepsen!!!!!!! Love Love Love it! Good buy for a relatively low price. I would recommend
B00A8ECU24|3.0|its a good game to pass the time. kids enjoy playing it too. just be carefull they could easily make perchases without realizing it. I believe you can ti. that in settings though.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I was watching this movie on HBO and liked it so much that I decided to purchase my own copy.  I'm happy  that I did and would recommend you too consider the purchase of this DVD.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|I love this movie because of it's religious humor. I'll certainly be showing it to many friends. Great filming and it's in Norwegian!
B0031ES8P6|5.0|My daughter loves this little Hello Kitty. Not a bad price for such a huge impression on my little lady.
B008N1V11U|4.0|It is really fun but chugs battery I like no battery left compared to the amount I would have lost if I played either minecraft pocket edition or jetpack joyride.  The city level is ok depiction of the movie
B009AMALLM|4.0|There are lots of dumb horror fans calling this bad because it didn't have lots of \\"scary scenes\\" and that's exactly the type of moron feedback that ruins movies.<br />If this movie consisted of many \\"scary moments\\" then it would be as badly one sided as the rest of these horror films out now. It has a nice amount of scares.<br /><br />This film helps connect the dots with the previous releases and if you are actually a smart enough movie-goer not afraid to use your brain to put the whole story together you will enjoy this! It isn't the franchise's best but most certainly not terrible either. Hopefully everyone was smart enough to watch till end credits to see extra footage which is said to be a set up for a latin spin-off and there is also pa5 on the way. So to all those giving this lower rating you're an idiot this is a good movie. In my opinion the best is between 2 and 3. Let's all hope the next releases are better though.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Item came exactly as described and on time. I have had no problems with the CD and am enjoying it!
B006UHZ7OQ|5.0|I recently upgraded my lenses to the 2.8 versions.  They are a burden to carry, but this vest helps immensely.
0321885112|5.0|Since I have received the book, I read it several times and each time is better. I find new meanings, new tricks that were previously hidden. First time was weird: it may sound easy to put down on sketch your thoughts because the book is simple. Well I found that, to me, is not easy at all but following Mike's suggestions it become better try after try.  Thank you Mike, I wish you a great success as you deserve.
B009C5Z112|5.0|This album is simply amazing. If I were to try and sum up the general feel encompassed in this album it would be as follows: Melodic metal with a Finnish tint, Viking &#34;at sea&#34; song elements, japanese village flavouring, and orquestral seasoning.<br /><br />This album ended up taking about 6 years to make (part of that material is going to go to Time II because it was too much for one album) and there is not a single song that I don't absolutely love. All of this album has a feel of maturity to it that is amazing for a second album from any band. Even their first album (which I also highly recommend, it is self-titled incase you're interested) showed a high level of cohesion from the band members though it was a bit less masterful than this album.<br /><br />If I absolutely had to pick one song as my favorite it would be &#34;Land of Snow and Sorrow.&#34; For whatever reason that song is perfect all the way through.<br /><br />For those of you who play instruments this album has a lot to offer as well. I play Guitar, Drums, Piano, and Bass and everyone of those instruments, where used, is used very well. The drummer does the tightest alternating blast beat I've ever heard and he does it in a way that it doesn't come across as a balls out death metal sound. It actually adds to the melody and the enjoyability of the songs.<br /><br />I'm extremely looking forward to Time II, which is supposed to come out in 2013.<br /><br />Also, this album is 5$. Which is ridiculous considering how much I've paid for music I like incomparably less.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This item came on time and exactly as described. I have had no problems with the CD and am enjoying it!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. Bought a new set that came in the factory plastic. Over half of the discs that came were unplayable the first time out of the package.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|At first I thought this was just another book about the troubles of high school. But it is so much more. I highly recommended this book!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Sweet!  I can now take it everywhere with me.  A simple games with lots of strategy and lots of logic.
B009FZFONO|5.0|this series is one of the most macabre I have ever seen, but I think the character development is done well. I has me spellbound and afraid for each person. After you get over the gore it is a very exciting adventure story. Hope they keep this going for awhile.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|1. Can create tons of individual alarms each with different times and/or settings<br />2. Tons of different alarm tones to choose from<br />3. Can set max # of snoozes allowed from 0-unlimited<br />4. Dismiss method can be press and click, shake the device, captcha or math<br />5. Math problems can be customized as well (difficulty and number correct required)<br /><br />I love this alarm clock. I have tried several different alarm clock apps because I have insomnia so I am extremely hard to wake up in the morning. The alarm has to be loud and difficult to dismiss.<br />With this alarm clock I can make tons of different alarms each with it's own setup. The setup can by different by changing the alarm tones, snooze limit, snooze time and dismiss methods. The dismiss methods are what really sets this alarm apart from others I have tried. You can choose to be required to shake the device, solve a math problem or enter captcha to dismiss the alarm. I usually choose the math  problem and I can even tweak that setting! You can change the difficulty of the math problem and how many correct problems are required to dismiss up to 10.<br />Ever since I started using this alarm I have not missed a wake up time!
1401937268|5.0|I absolutely love these cards and felt a connection with them as soon as I opened the package. They have gorgeous pictures that just draw you in. They're very positive and up lifting. They are well worth the money.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Like most Mah Jong games, it's fun and addictive. No grievence with the game itself, just the fact that you can only replay a set number of tile shapes over and over unless you purchase additional content.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is so funny and easy to read. Once you start you can't stop reading it. Best ever. My opinion
B009DP9D6A|5.0|First real introduction to deadmau5 but I really enjoyed this album. Reminiscent of early electronic/industrial music this fits into a unique genre that as of late has not had much airplay in the U.S. If you like electronic music especially Daftpunk check this one out you will not be disappointed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like being able to use this app to check on the life of the battery. I like the colors that are used too
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I used to play chess all the time as a kid - I played against friends, family members and even had an electronic chess game that I was competitive at all the way up to grand master level. However, having not played chess for a couple of decades it seems it is not like riding a bike. In all but one game I've played I've been thoroughly demolished. I pushed close in one game, but lost because of a stupid error. This, however, is why I love the game. It's challenging and will take a long time for me to master.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is so cool.  It installed with no problems, never shuts down, and it is so ADDICTIVE, and it was FREE.  I highly recommend this app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was really good and I love it<br />Because it talks about Greg and Rowley looking for a date to the dance
B007WPM0TK|5.0|I just finished this movie and all I can say is WOW!  Easily the best love story I've seen in a long time.  The performance that Eddie Redmayne gives is amazing and heartbreaking.  I love period movies and this is also a very well done.  The locations, art direction and costume design had me feeling as if I was getting a glimpse of the period of the 1910's into World War I.  The misery those brave men experienced in the trenches in palpable through this story.  Highly recommended!!.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I find I've developed a serious love of cello music.  I'm addicted to Piano Guys.  You can tell from their videos they love what they do.  That makes me love them even more.  Their music moves me, sometimes literally.  And a few songs can almost bring me to tears (Beethoven's 5 Secrets).  My 4 year old son LOVES Peponi and could watch the video repeatedly.  I eagerly look forward to more albums and will forever be a diehard fan.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|A love story that I have read before in different books or seen seen in movies. Fifty shades of grey mixed with Jerry Maguire  movie mixed with \\"how to lose a guy in 10 days\\". I gave this book 2 stars because I found it to be like to many others.
B000VDDDVO|3.0|The set came in good time, but both discs were rattling around in the box, so I had to unseal it, which I didn't want to do, since it was a gift.  Both discs had come loose from the case.  They were visibly scratched, but the gift recipient said they still played all right.  I was not happy giving it to her that way.
B0071LLHGC|4.0|Awesome fm broadcast of wplj show, Duane is Phenomenal , This is the one!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />A must for every fan, great price
B005LAIGWS|1.0|This has to be the absolute worst adaptation of a comic movie known to man. I don't who in the world would finance such a travesty. The direction is a total joke  and all over the place. If I could give it zero stars that's what it'd receive. But I really should have known it was a bomb from the packaging. It clearly states on the bottom of the cover \\"From the Guys that brought you Crank\\". Nobody even wants their name associated with it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Hopelessly romantic. I loved it!!! It is definitely a good buy and a great read. I would buy it again.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|The  storyline here is close to the earlier story of the book Player of games, but this time moralic disbute is lesser in volume, or I just don't catch up it due to my own western moralic corruption or find the subtle discussion of matters from the book which has been elegantly presented at previous works.
B0071BY1PG|5.0|I loved the original 2D version as DVD - enough to happily buy the 2D Blu-ray and I was delighted to find state of the art application of both high definition video and audio in that format. However when I found out that a 3D version of this original Kung Fu Panda movie had been released, I initially hesitated to purchase it - mostly because of a lack of reviews for that version - but now that I have seen the 3D Blu-ray I cannot understand why there are not dozens of rave reviews for it. My brother and I have over thirty 3D Blu-rays, and I reckon that the quality of 3D design here is certainly as good as in Up! (which is my standard for excellence in that format). Kung Fu Panda is a wonderful story which is ideal for all ages - being heart warming, inspiring, engaging and highly entertaining. It has a magnificent sound design (especially in surround) and every frame of every scene is pure art - made all the more appreciable in 3D. Naturally I highly recommend the Kung Fu Panda Blu-ray 3D.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I want to read it again and again!!!! I loved EVERYTHING about this book. The story, the twists and turns. This book kept my heart and my head wanting more. It was beautiful!!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was a nice non cliche romance.  Love the detail on the military.  I will be trying the movie as well.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Well written - action packed - full of surprises - well acted - Loved it - cannot wait to see Season 2 in its entirety.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This camera gives you a great picture! I would recommend it anytime, to anyone. Easy to use, plus high quality.
B001EBWIT0|5.0|Great value and avilability for such an old movie, enjoyed the experience of finding old dvds so quickly, thank you
B001A3GSJ8|5.0|This is one of my husbands favorite albums by faith no more. Im glad he found it on here. Yea
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Well written series.  One I can related to because of the time period.  All that smoking brings back memories. An ongoing story of Madison Avenue marketing which really keeps you interested.
B00004CXYO|1.0|it did not work. it would not play in my dvd player or my blu ray player. any other disc I have bought or rented has worked in either player. I then returned the dvd and I have not received anything back. thanks for nothing...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't know how people have got through the first book let alone three. The writing was horrible. It seriously says the same thing over and over again. The one thing that bothered me the most was how Anastasia didnt even know who Christian was and then all of a sudden she was like &#34;I am with the famous Christian Gray!&#34; everytime she was with him. One second she didnt care about who this guy was but then because everyone else was like you are with him she goes all crazy.  Also I feel like she would need some chapstick for how many times she bites her lips. If I ever read about someone biting their lips like that again I might just rip my hair out.<br /><br />Pretty much the story was bad, the sex scenes were just okay, and apparently women being in a slight abusive relationship is okay these days.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I love the pink Floyd! I recently lost my iPod touch with all my music on it, so I have to buy all the cd's I lost. Great CD at a Great Price!!
B000VYNYN0|4.0|I remember Evil Dead 2 very well as a kid. I then read Bruce Campbell was releasing a remake of the original Evil Dead.<br />It is not as good as &#34;2&#34;, but definitely has it's moments. Very gory for a 70's movie.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|DVD's that my teenagers and I watch together. Gross blood and violence, but Sam and Dean are nice to watch as they kill demons and monsters!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I love this show. When I first saw the previews for it I thought it looked really cheesy to go along with some bad acting. I was wrong. I literally watched the first season in one day. I love the characters and their personalities. Most shows now-a-days have the main characters say really stupid stuff and do weird things that teenager dont actually do(a good example of that is Shanke It Up on Disney). But this show doesn't! My favorite character is Stiles. He is hilarious and pretty much makes the show.<br /><br />The second season is even better than the first and I will soon be purchasing it here in the near furture.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest till the  end. I like the ending. I would recommend this book to others.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books. What a fantastic trilogy. Action, fantasy, romance, suspense. It's all there. Very easy reading as well.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This is a very nicely produced and enjoyable game. Fans of Cut the Rope and Where's My Water should definitely pick this up. It's a great combination of Maze and puzzle solving with original graphics and  gameplay.
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|I pretty much got this cd just so I could listen to Roots Before Branches over and over again. The last episode of the season was very emotional and that song did it for me. The rest of the songs are amazing too but that one just stands out for me. Plus I have every other glee cd so I couldnt pass on this one either.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I have not watched this movie yet, but if it's anything like the first one in the series, it's sure to be good.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I began by watching the TV series, and as usual, you cannot capture on film the brilliance between the pages.  I find myself ever-entwined emotionally with these well-written characters, and cannot wait for the next chapter.
B007Y36K46|5.0|One of the best SF movies I've seen. The book series is enjoyable, I highly recommend the books and the movie.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I thought it was a good app and it was cool to be able to watch other things but it was sorta slow
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Howey had a really interesting idea here, but didn't go far enough with it in some ways. Reminded me a lot of The Matrix. Similar to that trilogy, it starts off with a bang, but then loses its way somewhere in the middle. Did like the description of the silo and its social strata, but couldn't really care for any of the characters.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It took me until I was 27 to finally read Ender's Game and I'm both glad to have had it to enjoy now, while also a little upset I waited so long. If you have the choice I'd recommend reading it at a younger age, but any age is a good age to jump in.
0740748475|5.0|I bought this as a black Friday gift to myself. The books are quite heavy.  That only means there is more than enough C&H to love.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It's good to know what really happened isn't what the media led us to think.<br />God bless the people who serve this country.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|my kids love the claymation style shows and this one is funny and cute.  They own this first season and even the christmas special
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are challanging. fun to have something to look forword to complete. fun for children to play as well.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Great looking watch.  Seems to keep time to within one second a day variance.  Stop watch function is useless for any detailed measurement with increments in 5 minute blocks.  Otherwise, she's a real looker...
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|What a story! You go through the whole movie wondering what is real and what isn't. We thoroughly enjoyed this drama and the ending took us by surprise.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a 21 year old boy and he loved it. We all play with it. Such a cool device!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the story & it felt real! This book was one I couldn't put down, had to know what happens next.
B008OLO7ME|5.0|If you are searching for a slim bag to carry your Macbook Pro 13 or even Air 11, it might be one of the best options. Booq is always surprising me with its high quality products and this one brings the same: high quality in every detail. If I'm not wrong, it has a kind of &#34;water resistance&#34; as well. I really recommend.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very nice app. I have tried other apps but none were as good as this one:) I really like the color feature and that it also comes with a timer.
B008R65Y28|1.0|I wanted the cry baby that was not directors cut,my granddaughter hates it.she said that it is different.if you have it the way she wants it I will send this one back,she has not opened it.I had bought her one at walmart and it was the same as this,so i seen this one on amazon but i did not notice that it was directors cut also.Thank You Pat Ostmann
1400067820|5.0|COMMENTARY ON WHY TO READ THE BOOK  Before reading further see other fine reviews.  This note is commentary to encourage reading the book, not a summary of content.  I developed respect for Taleb as an original thinker and believed others would benefit, thus chose to `review'.  With a limited number of original thinkers in a world of repackagers, people who can take a blank sheet and formulate new ideas are few.  ANTIFRAGILE  &#34;Antifragile&#34; is coined, no surprise.  Form your own impression but I see &#34;antifragile&#34; as a descriptor for a system/position robust subjected to negative random events while thriving from positive events (... &#34;that only the strong shall thrive; that surely the weak shall perish, and only the fit survive&#34;).  A unifying concept in the book is the need to secure an asymmetry of reward/risk, minimizing loss in an uncertain world while capturing the gains from positive occurrences.  On the surface this is simple.  The challenge is in the execution.  STYLE  This is not an academic treatise on risk.  It is more of a long stream of consciousness, a recitation of thinking and philosophy viewed through the lens of `fragility' (more on this).  &#34;The first rule is not to fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.&#34; Unlike academia who successfully fooled many with unproven ideas (ideas that can hurt you), Taleb is a pragmatist, a skeptic who seeks evidence and applies `science' to determine what to believe or support.  At times Antifragile can feel tedious because of the cascade of stories and references.  At these times, I urge stopping and pondering.  The book is not lacking in ideas nor insights, despite an unfiltered, sometimes seeming intolerant sounding `voice'.  The stories and references are documented, not invented.  The unvarnished candor is refreshing.  Suggestion for attacking the book ... read the Chapter Summaries and Prologue carefully.  Stop and think before proceeding.  For those needing a pithy message, read the Conclusion (Chapter 25) next.  But ... don't stop reading or you'll miss the experience.  Go to Chapter 1.  FINANCIAL  Of particular note is the criticism resulting from Taleb's scathing dismissal of Modern Portfolio Theory, Efficient Market Hypothesis, and financial theorists.  Frankly, I'm shocked that many practical investors would believe MPT and EMH but the ideas have been continuously peddled by the investment community for decades despite the individual investor literature ... David Dremen in Contrarian Investment Strategies (1998), Benoit Mandelbrot in The Misbehavior of Markets.  Mandelbrot discovered `fat tails' back to the mid 60's.  That Taleb independently drew similar conclusions based on rigorous analysis commends him.  Part of the reason these theories were so attractive to academia (mathematics borrowed from physics) is it dealt with symmetric analytical functions.  The world is not necessarily symmetric and analytic, much less linear.  Taleb makes this clear; everyone should understand.  IMPACT ON READERS  Antifragile is a book that may split the readership.  Those who are `antifragile' in thinking may gain fewer insights but will be enriched by ideas and historical stories.  Those whose thinking does not lean antifragile may find ideas strange.  The key for the latter will be to suspend judgment, open minds, see with `fresh eyes'.  For both there may be the overarching question about re-inventing oneself, adapting to be `antifragile'.  The answer lies in personal preferences, interests, and boundary conditions.  What are you willing to do and not willing to do?  Drive a cab or work as a clerk for an established firm?  Life is not a point function with an end state defining `success', enjoyment or even meaning.  It's about the journey, not the destination which is common for all.  Despite this, counsel offered to achieve antifragility should better protect you from whatever befalls you.  SELECTED SECTIONS  Planning is an anathema to Taleb who regards it as useless.  Much to support this with untold stories of plans gone awry.  Safe to say we live in ashes of plans failed.  A lateral view may be valid that it is the exercise in thinking, exploring optionality, that has value, not the product.  Unknown unknowns remain unknown.  (&#34;One who doesn't know and doesn't know that he doesn't know... He will be eternally lost in his hopeless oblivion!&#34;)  Book VI, &#34;Via Negativa&#34;, is thought provoking with a thesis of the importance of `what not to do', and caution as to the fragility of trying to forecast what will be.  `What not' has to do with filtering (... subtractive thinking, my first experience 1989 when I realized this was powerful).  Strategy execution places a premium on optimal use of resources, not being distracted by trying to do too many things.  Sadly, selling this in a large organization invested in retaining all options to avoid making mistakes is challenging.  Another interesting topic section is seeing the future, relevant to organizational learning thinking (e.g. Theory U).  Taleb is the pragmatist.  The last section, Book VII, &#34;The Ethics of Fragility and Antifragility&#34; commands attention.  With blistering criticism, actions and people, Taleb condemns the lack of skin in the game.  Please read this.  VOICE  Admittedly, Taleb can be received as a polarizing figure.  Evidence of this is in the reviews.  As I've suggested, put this aside.  This book has significant ideas to impart to the open minded reader.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I enjoy watching  TV shows with intelligent banter between characters that are believable , though not always likable . This show offers this and a lot more.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Background:<br />I'm in college and my college has a movie theater in it. They promoted this movie heavily and I saw a few previews on tv. I'm not gonna lie I watched it because I am an emma watson fan, but I LOVED the movie. I didn't even know it was a book until my roommate pointed it out to me, so I made it a priority to read the book.<br /><br />Actual book review:<br />As with any movie and book combo, there are some differences. There are actually a FEW big differences, but overall the book is still really good. A lot of people have criticized the book because of the character's voice as the fact that he is thrown into too many heavy situations, but even still it is a great book. The voice is distinctive, but believable. The situations are a bit much and are presented one after another, but this is fiction. It is entertaining and hilarious (really I caught myself laughing out loud a few times).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend it
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Love Kate Morton's writing. I am totally enthralled when I read .i read all her work and can't wait for the next.!!

1451695195|3.0|Save your money, there is nothing here but lots of airy fairy \\"I had a wonderful experience\\" stuff. Every second chapter is about what he found out later his family members were up to during his seven day coma, it reads like a great big thank you letter. He goes on about wonderful insights to dark energy and matter, then proceeds to tell us nothing!<br />This guy is certainly lucky to be alive, but does he have anything \\"new\\" to offer readers .... no. And he is still apparently none the wiser as to how he contracted the meningitis, the wonderful beings of light didn't tell him that.<br />Though he has started a charity because of his experiences called Eternea.
1451627289|3.0|It was a bit of an arduous read for me. Takes a long time to get through if you can't read every single day.
B006WQLH7G|1.0|I didn't like the way it totally took over my phone.  It was not very intuitive.  It made changes to some of my settings that I didn't know it was making, and it caused my phone to lock up when I was checking my email.  This continued even after rebooting and even after shutting down, removing the battery, and then restarting.  Everything worked fine after I deleted it from my phone, so I know that's what was causing the conflicts.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I just saw Alicia Keys in a concert this week that a friend had free tickets for. I had to get some of her music because she is incredible! Beautiful voice!
B000GCFO08|5.0|This item was discribed perfect. It was exactly as anticipated, just what I wanted. Thanks again for the great product.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was reluctant to buy this book, as it was a YA book which I usually just pass over, but the price was right and the reviews were glowing (although you can't always trust the reviews). I really loved this book!!! Great story, lots of emotion and I couldn't stop reading!!!!<br />GO BUY THIS BOOK :)
B0011QC9U6|1.0|I got this so I wouldn't have to read the book and it showed up and didn't work in any device and was a blank disk
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I love Clint and Amy but they should have been grandfather and grand daughter not daughter and father. They don't seem to be able to decide if this is going to be a comedy or a drama. As it turns out is is neither and I still do not know wha t is is.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This is a very entertaining game.  I do wish that greater zoom was available, because I'm playing on a small tablet. I did enjoy the the various puzzles, but I found the many 20 second penalties frustrating. A touch to move the screen counts as an error :(
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Apparently they don't sell the 2 disc deluxe  version where I lived so I ordered it from amazom and came in mint condition, very satisfied with purchase, and love majority of songs listed, worth the price from a great artist who will be missed just like michael jackson.This covers her entire career completely which is great for any fan or newcomer, Includes all her big hits, The only two songs I see missing is Miracle from I'n your baby tonight and when you believe a duet with mariah carey from prince of egypt soundtrack no biggie though the good outweigh the bad.R.I.P Mrs. Houston
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A fun game it's like Rubik's cube on a screen trying to connect all the different colors..I like a game that challenges you to think & strategist ..your next move an it's very addicting ..
B000001DQI|4.0|I didn't get this album for a long time because they play most of the songs on the radio anyway, so it just never crossed my mind that there might be some really good songs on it that I'd never before heard. For example, Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding is a phenomenal song. Plus, it's 11 minutes and it opens the album. I thought Street Kids was on it, but I just forgot to check, but still a great album.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|An engrossing read and made me think about what I eat and the true costs of our cheap food.  More interesting than I had expected.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Great action, great cast, and just the right amount of cheese, one-liners, and heads being blown off!  Very entertaining with some good laughs!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the best bible apps available. Being able to use the recorded function is great. Very good choice.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|I didn't watch this movie, but my sister does. She hadn't seen it in a long time, so I thought it'd make a nice b-day present. It did. She loves it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Cant get it to down load or work on the Fire........have not used it since Christmas  sucks.  What else needs to be said if you cant get it to work you dont use it.  What a waste of money.
B005EHILV4|1.0|Hisses noticeably. I've tried everything, from bypassing the main mix mic through noise cancellation software and routing it back, to using a 1a usb charger as a power supply. Nothing works.<br />Useless.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!! This book was so amazing. I saw the cartoon movie and left just being confused and disappointed. This book answered my questions and much more. I love the story and the land and the castle. What an ingenious place. Highly recommended for readers who love magic and that sort of thing.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|it works great good colors and sounds a very challenging game. great for waiting in line or on breaks at work
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Can not figure out how to get it to work on this device.  Nothing that I have tried to down load has worked on this product.  Not a happy camper here........  have not used it since I got this at Christmas.  Can not understand how to get it to download and use the system.  Must be broken.  My wife loves her Kendle but my Fire sucks...........
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game has an awesome story line.  Really keeps to your attention there is a twist around every corner. The graphics were also great and u really liked the voice-over so I didn't have to read everything
1572816112|5.0|The Deviant Moon Tarot, what a Great Deck I can only say \\"Why didn't I find you sooner!\\" A wonderful Deck for Collectors. Patrick Valenza has created one of the Best Decks I have seen in years, the art is rich and deep in sybolism and Great for reaching into the subconcious of his Moon World. I can't recommed this Deck for Beginners, but it's a Must Have. I use it for meditation and personal pathwork. His LWB that comes with the deck explains his thoughts on the card meanings that don't stray too far from the traditional meanings, but give them a brief and interesting Twist. He promises to write a more indepth book on this Deck in the Future, I'll be Looking Forward To It!!! This Deck has Earned Five Stars *****.<br />-dop
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I caught an episode on Netflix when my daughter was watching and am HOOKED!!  I very quickly made it through seasons 1 and 2 and we are getting the Season 3 episodes here up until it starts back in February!  Tons of action, characters you want to follow and terrific writing!  Keep it coming--- any show that a 50yr old Mom and her 16yr old daughter both enjoy is amazing... and this one is IT.
B008S4FZ6E|5.0|I would happily have read this book even if it was twice as long, the details are fascinating. I only ever listened to Duran Duran as background music but bassist John Taylor opens up an engrossing view of the band and just how hardworking they really were. He frames the story of the band within his own personal journey and has a light-hearted and self-effacing style. I highly recommend this book, it's easily one of the best pop/rock autobiographies I've ever read.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|To brighten up your mood, your day, your moment, listen to Stacey Kent and her upbeat songs. I love listening to it while I cook, it's just wonderful!
0880796863|5.0|I have used the Rider Tarot off and on for years. This deck published by US GAMES is a Wonderful Reproduction of the Original Rider. The deck is a good price, and great for beginners! The back of the cards have a nice pattern, and the cards are Sturdy but Easy to work with. Included is the book THE KEY TO THE TAROT, which is historical, and a nice read, it includes a poster to lay out the Celtic Cross. I recomend this Deck Highly.<br />-dop
0060853972|4.0|Very cool book. A friend recommended and I have been enjoying reading it. Both intellectually stimulating and funny. Good mix
B00A31UXLW|4.0|For my money one of the most consistently excellent crime series ever written, 'The Black Box' continues and expands the story of Harry Bosch while delivering a satisfyingly twisty plot. This book will satisfy any fan and would even serve a newcomer as an accessible intro to Bosch. My only criticism is that the end felt a little rushed compared to the beautifully paced beginning and middle. A small qualm with an otherwise excellent book.
B0087ZG7FC|5.0|for such a low price, I got both the CD and the DVD bundle.<br />I love tony Montana (who doesn't??) and his epic quotes.<br /><br />Get it.. and the world will be yours.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I needed a case for my Kindle Fire HD (what a wonderful Christmas present from a dear friend!), and glad I chose this one.  It's so easy to use it as an easel so you have your hands free as you read or whatever.
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|The fundamental flaw with this game is that creating anything takes time. They might as well rename this &#34;The Waiting Game.&#34; Nobody wants to wait five to ten minutes per player as they rifle through tiny Lego pieces trying to construct something (far too few of the interesting pieces!). Nobody ever gets to finish their object, either, because it gets guessed long before it is complete. It looked like a fun game in theory, but turned out to be a total loss as a game. I bought this for my daughter for X-mas, and I will be truly surprised if anyone plays with it again after the single time we played it. My 30+ daughter, my 11 & 14 year old grandkids & I were extremely bored in the first 5 minutes of the game and looking for any excuse to leave the game, which we brought to a close after no more than 15 minutes.
B00006GFAB|5.0|I have always been a fan of Kiss. I have Kiss Dressed To Kill, but this album had other songs. I did not have the song, I Was Made for Loving You and found it on this album. I recommend the album to any Kiss fan and you now what you are getting with any song by Kiss.  The Music Dude
6302642256|5.0|This movie is a classic. And you will like it as much as I did, it is on VHS. And it is a long movie and lots of excitement and humor also, and sometimes very funny. They made this movie for all kinds of people, if you like spaceships and about what could happen in the future, this tape is for you. Try it, you well like it as much as I did. I am not going bto tell you what happens, you will have to see it for youeself. I recommened this Classic with JOEY CRAMER. Jim in Ohio
B006ZS4G24|5.0|MY NIECE JUST LOVED IT AND WAS VERY HAPPY TO GET IT.  SHE SAID IT WAS EASY TO BUILD.  SHE LOVED ALL THE ANIMALS AND CHARACTERS.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|When my daughter lost interest I quickly began playing this game on my Kindle. A fun game to distract one away from life and kids.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This game is well worth your time. It had incredibly cute graphics, and a pretty original game mechanic too. The goal is to lead your starving mouse to the cheese while avoiding obstacles. It's broken up into nice, short chunks of gameplay. Think where's my water or angry birds, but cuter and with a mouse.
B00007AJF8|4.0|The DVD is in great shape, with no scratches or blemishes on it. But, we were not overjoyed with the actual movie.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|LOOKED AND SOUNDED REAL TO LIFE.<br />IT KEEPS YOU WATCHING. WE LIKED IT.<br />THE ACTORS WERE GREAT AND ALL PLAYED TRUE TO LIFE PARTS.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was Such an amazing read. I can't even find the words t  describe it. Will  definitely read it again.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a good and basic calculator.  I like the large buttons and large readout.  Does add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  Does not do anything fancy but I rarely need that anyway.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|I rated it this high because the description of the product was right on the money. I appeared to be band new.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is amazing! You would think a show with zombies would eventually become repetitive and boring, but The Walking Dead is anything but boring! You want to keep watching all the episodes...Truly fun to watch, and the plot is great, suspenseful, romantic, action-packed...everything you want put together! Definitely recommend it for everyone, except very young kids and gore-hating people.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Great game mechanic, the game is fun and addicting! The art is well done and the game has a polished feel to it. I haven't noticed any issues with it and I'll update this review as I play more. Great choice for the free app of the day, and I would have gladly paid for it.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|This book has a little more grit to the story than some similar books. However it is not fantastic but i still recommend for an enjoyable holiday read.
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|I rated this as I did because even though the DVD was in terrific condition, I thought the Plot could have been better developed.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It's a very entertaining book with well developed characters and story. If you enjoyed his other historical novels you should read this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a great book to read i cannot wait to see the movie.The ending was a shocker ,two thumbs up.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Loved the book it's hilarious, and entertaining as can be! Read and you will love it a lot. Time passes really quickly when you read this.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This high rating comes from the fact that I received the product within a few days, and ther ewere no blemishes on the DVd.
B0001ARCFA|1.0|I bought 2 of these headphones for my 20 and 23 year-old sons (both musicians).  They had been highly recommended by a salesman at Guitar Center, who said they were widely used in recording studios.  The sound quality was ok and they fit the head very comfortably, but the game-breaker was the volume.  Neither set played loud enough...we tried plugging into iPads, iPods, computer, and direct from a keyboard.  With everything turned up &#34;to 11&#34;, they weren't loud enough.  We had thought the first set we tried was faulty, but then the second set was exactly the same.  Amazon was great about the return, even though both sets had been opened.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I enjoyed all the twist and turns in the book. Thought I was back in High School again .
B0071CNGI8|5.0|It was a wonder full book  I cried when it ended you must watch the movie i hope it is as good as the book
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was the best book I have ever read. I could not believe all the stuff that went on. It was amazing.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|only problem I see is that they made purchasing diamond and bits too easy to buy. otherwise this is a great game free too
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is an easy game to enjoy. You get a lot of different games all in one package. You can spend hours caught up on the games.<br />My grandson and I spent Sunday afternoon laughing and playing. This is about the only game we can play together. Thanks...
B009AMALLM|3.0|I never got a chance to see this in the theater like the other 3, but saw it off iTunes which just came out for a pre-release and I actually thought the movie was ok.  I heard all the bad reviews so expected the worst but ended up being better then I thought it would be.  I still think 3 is the scariest and best along with the original which was very good as well.<br /><br />Not sure if the actual movie or the DVD/Blu-Ray will have this but, the scariest scene from the trailer where she is on Facetime with her friend and that little boy Robby is standing outside in their driveway and she says what a creepy kid he is and then he looks up at her.  Then her room goes black and the alarm is going off saying front door open, side door open, back door open, and you see Katie (I think that was her name) standing in the room.  Like on the cover of the video.  That was all cut out.  So that was very disappointing.  Hopefully the Blu-Ray will have it.<br /><br />But overall lots of scenes to make you jump.  The last 5 mins were freaky.  But the story overall didn't really make sense as you don't know who Robby even is and the whole Hunter thing etc.<br /><br />Wish they had more things like PA3 had with the ghost sheet, kitchen stuff going on the ceiling, Toby pulling her hair, Bloody Mary scene, etc.  Not many cool stuff like that.
B007SGM084|5.0|VERY ENTERTAINING. I COULD BARELY PUT THIS SERIES DOWN. THESE BOOKS A QUICK READS. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BY THEM.
B00136Q1XA|5.0|I totally enjoyed Jeff Lynne and the Electric Light Orchestra back in the 70 & 80's and I didn't have A New World Record in MP3 format.  Great songs digitized perfectly.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use and integrates with other applications. Haven't had any problems with it. I didn't realize what I was missing.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|It's one of those books you can't put down!  I could easily find myself read this book again and still be as shock, scared and excited all over again. Just as I was finishing three last few pages I already bought the next one so I could keep reading.  5 arrow heads out of 5.
B00138H9I4|5.0|When you hear these songs it hard to believe that these two giants didn't stay together.  The guitar work is fantastic by Jeff Beck and the vocals by Rod Stewart have never been better
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing to just relax and have fun.  Thinking about a game rather than work.<br />Easy to play anyone can do it.
0743270754|5.0|Very revealing on the man, not the myth we have created.  Explodes the pedestal that we have put Lincoln on but it makes it all the more powerful that he had to deal with the same issues we have to deal with today.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So easy to buy and sell on the move I have two kids so I love that I can take a picture and sell all from my kindle
B007US9NA8|5.0|I have been using this book for about 2 years now as my primary guide. I'm very happy with the results. I only needed to get in shape but this book has taken me further than I expected.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Have to buy this all? Not cool I was just getting into the game!!! Absolute bull ): can't there be a completely free game like this here??
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game but halfway through it nothing would show up on screen. You could only hear music and the background noise. Good while it lasted.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Not regret it.<br />If can buy. Going to buy another.<br />ha ha ha ha!<br /><br />I want to buy about 10.

B005HV6Y84|4.0|This item was shipped in a bubble wrap style envelope and the jewel case arrived cracked. It was ordered as a gift and will be given tomorrow, so I don't know if the disc inside is damaged.  Fingers crossed!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I enjoyed this until my kindle got attacked by a virus through this app.  Glad I decided to install virus protection on my kindle.  Beware everyone!!  Unfortunately a lot of these viruses are coming from the ads that are used to help pay for these types of free apps.  If your system starts to slow down and seems to be running slower, start to investigate why immediately.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Totally worth the purchase and wildly entertaining.  I only wish that there was another novel to continue this great series.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had to give this book a &#34;5&#34;! I would have given it higher if I could have! I could not put this book down. It takes us all where we have often fantasized and thought about and confirms what I had always wished for and read about in the bible. It is so beautiful and skillfully written. Thank you to the great doctor for his sincere frankness. It is as if I went through the experience myself. What a great true storyteller! Magnificent! God Bless him!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  I have it on my Kindle and phone and use it for Twitter as well.  I hope they never get rid of this one.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I initialy downloaded this for the kids, but it is awesome; Once we start we can't stop. My son loves the laser or light saber
B004QX07G4|5.0|This is a small book, but has great heart. I laughed until I cried. My only wish, since I bought this for my Kindle, is that I could share it with my friends. One day, I hope!!!
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I own the original CD but when I saw this on sale for just 7 bucks, I knew I had to own this one as well. The bonus tracks are a great addition to the already great album. If you are a fan of Katy Perry and do not own the original Teenage Dream, go ahead and grab this CD!
B00A2FSXHK|1.0|This film is rated PG-13 -&#62; there is no way this film is appropriate for a 13 year old child.  It is totally disgusting.  Do NOT watch this
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm so hooked on this game.<br />I would recommend this to any one.<br />Can't wait to play everyday so relaxing.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|Happy with purchase.  Have used a couple of times for indoor photos.  Hope to use it more in the future.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett makes history come to life. Can't wait for the third book. I read every historic fiction by Follett I can find.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|There's nothing much to say about the book except it was very formulaic. While majority of the books in the \\"romance\\" genera are formulaic, but let's face it, there are still some that stands out. This book wasn't one of those.<br /><br />For me there was nothing about the characters that grabbed my attention or made me want to care. Frankly, Megan's friends and cousin were annoying, and probably could've been left out of the book.<br /><br />Least the kindle edition was free.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I LOVE the Diary of a wimpy kid books best one yet Jeff Kinney is AWESOME I LOVE HIM XOXOXO
B002LB13SE|3.0|young women ARE at risk. They should know. As a parent, I hope I could do what these folks did.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|The i7-2600K is a last gen product but it's still a solid work horse for those on a budget. The K after the 2600 means that it's great for overclocking if that's your goal. The OS will see those 4 cores as 8 cpus and use each one according to the needs of the running program. That means if you suddenly see that one of the cores is running close to 100% then you're assured that, like James Bond 007, another core will be available to takes its place when needed. The onboard Intel video isn't as good as the newest generation but you can spend less than a C note on a dedicated GPU with at least a GB of video RAM that'll kick Intel's a$$ anyway. But even if you're just a modest gamer then you wouldn't be caught dead without a dedicated GPU anyway, right?<br /><br />If you can afford it I suggest going with the latest and greatest CPU since it'll give you the most longevity with all the latest technologies but for the most bang for your buck you can't go wrong with the 2600K.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Every since I saw her clip on You Tube, I've been a fan and this album doesn't disappoint.  I was very surprised at the pairing with Donnie Osmond.  He has a very nice and compatible voice.
B004132HZS|5.0|Hassle free deal. Easy purchase. Will do business with them again.<br /><br />highly recommended. will tell friends about them. over and out
B007THA4FI|2.0|I still love and respect Ms. Rowling's writing skills, but I just didn't like this story.  It was sort of like being forced to interview a handful of small-town families who were only allowed to reveal their dark, negative, petty sides.  I couldn't like or root for a single character.
B003XQ2VOG|4.0|I have seen Voyage from the bottom of the sea when I wad a child (VHS) and it's seen better the colors and everything.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Good action movie.Well written story.Great scenery through out the movie.The acting is ok.Plenty of wolves scenes in this movie.Plane crash is ok.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, that's why I bought it...  Rented it first, then bought it.  I like Chris Hemsworth's acting.
B00110K62U|5.0|I have seen this performance many times in the past as a VCR.  Now enjoying it as a DVD.  Love the making of the film information.  Enjoy the music, the performers, the stories within the story.  Excellent production.
B0000C23DO|4.0|Another great music  cd from the late sixties and early seventies.You will not be disappointed if you buy this cd.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Ummm, it's facebook. Everyone knows facebook by now. And they are constantly updating it and improving it....sooo that's always good.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I really don't care about this book it's only use for me was looking up vocab words so leave me alone
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is super awesome but is a lot like temple run still if u like temple run or stuff like that u should get this app!!
B0094KORXI|4.0|One of my favorite movies, just as good as i remember.  Only miss was a few spots where video quality was bad, though this may have been because I was streaming it rather than having downloaded it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Everything you would expect from a Solitaire app. Multiple backgrounds and decks as well as different dealing options. Has not crashed on me or created any other problems.
B0016492BW|5.0|Oh man, if you haven't seen this movie -you're missing out!  But don't worry, you can now rectify that by Netflix, Amazon rentals or buying it here on Amazon! This is the holy grail of comedies (sorry, couldn't resist the pun)!  This is one of the funniest movies ever made!  No, it's not \\"modern\\" comedy: dirty, a lot cussing, sexual oriented joking and the like. Nope, this has some class and style.  Made waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1975, this movie took comedies and slapped them around and then did it its own way.  The British way :)<br /><br />Look, if you don't know the meaning of my title (run away, run away!! -hint: it involves a rabbit) -then you gotta get this movie, or at least rent it!  Very recommended!!!!
B0082GQ5HG|4.0|The movie itself is pretty good. My biggest complaint is the lack of 3D. It really has a lot to be desired. I would recommend forgoing the 3D......Unless its on sale and you get all 3 discs.
0757302661|5.0|I had a home birth in November of 2012, I read this book and took a hypnobirthing seminar.  The book brings hope and inspiration.  I didn't think I could do a natural birth at home but after reading this book and practicing the techniques it was clear to me that I was in control of the birth I wanted to have.  Anyone that is considering natural child birth should check this book out.  Also the affirmation CD that comes with the book is amazing.  I would listen to it every night about a month before I gave birth and it would calm my doubts and fears.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game was filled with puzzles and item finds.  it kept me occupied for a whiile.  I used the hint quite often to find out where to go next.  the puzzles were fun to solve.  don't skip the puzzles because it makes the game more fulfilling
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the book but felt like it was cut short too quick :(<br />I hope more is to be written!
B009G78EE2|4.0|These tracks are really deep. I bought it originally for Thrift shop, but the other tracks had me coming back for more. I wasnt disappointed at all. Just about every track is a winner. If you want a album that gets back down to the roots of what rap was all about this is a good place to start!
B00992CF6W|5.0|please make the next update soon with pistons and red stone. it would be really awesome with those stuff. overall great game I love it 5 stars
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It definitely leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to read another one of her books. :)
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It's was a very good book. I love Charlie as a character and the ending mad the book even better.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|The product is fine overall, I believe there are greater headphones built by Sony, but for that kind of price it's hard to find a better product. I enjoy listening to all kind of music with headphone eveb though the bass is lower that for example a beats headset.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Reading now and find it is hard to put it down. intereting and keeps you on edge wanting to find out what happens next.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Advent calendars have always been a big part of the holidays in my family.  While Lego ones aren't cheap, one couldn't get all these mini figures for a lower price if purchased individually. This is the 2nd year we've had one and it won't be the last.
1439181780|5.0|The Secret:  The first time I read this book, I was blown away.  The ideas and concepts are eye opening.  Changing the way I currently think, to a new way of thinking is the challenge.  There is a difference between knowing the path and walking it.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|WOW - A Fun, Challenging game that let's you Draw a cheese Scent Path for CUTE MOUSE to follow.<br />Vibrant 3D Graphics and Neat Sound Effects add more enjoyment.  Easy enough for Kids but gets progressively harder so Adults will like it also.  IMPORTANTLY: You can help Kids when it gets harder so both of you can have fun SOLVING IT TOGETHER.  I will Love playing it with my Grandchildren.<br /><br />What I LIKE:<br />1. Mazes are great and include obstacles and Trip Switches to open and close GATES.<br />2. HD, 3D Graphics are Excellent and Entertaining.  CUTE CUT SCENES (see HINT below to speed up).<br />3. Nice Music and Upbeat Sound Effects are enjoyable and give POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT.<br />4. Challenges are Unique and Fun with Critters for Mouse to AVOID with different strategies.<br />5. Levels can be Replayed any time to Improve Scores and get More STARS.<br />6. App has an EXIT featured that shuts it down completely when you are done.<br /><br />HINT:  Slow Cut Scenes are nice but not necessary-You can BYPASS them by Tapping Screen!<br /><br />OVERALL:  Enjoyable Game that is nicely challenging and pleasant to play.  Good Replay Value for all ages though later levels may be too difficult for younger Kids.  Definitely a KEEPER.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Fantastic book that I didn't want to end. I am still dwelling within . Hopefully the wait  won't be too long. Come on George, take us back to the wall, Westeros,  Danny, tyrion,  baelish, sansa,take us back!
1449410243|5.0|If you have a cat or love cats this is a book for you.  I bought this for a Christmas present and we spent the rest of the day passing it around the room and laughing about the funny and ironic things cats do.  You may find most of these comics at  theoatmeal.com/comics but I feel it is well worth the price to have all the cat jokes in one place.  I am also a traditionalist when it comes to spending time with family and felt it well worth the price to keep the family away from huddling around a computer.
0307595862|5.0|And by that, i mean it was wonderfully written, suspenseful, and energetic to the end.  Five more words required?  Are you sure?
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am very happy with this backpack. Accommodates all 3 lenses I have and my SLR camera. With more space left for other accessories. I can say about the space for now ... not sure about the quality and life. but at this stage I would recommend this backpack to my friends..<br /><br />I will update more in about 2 month about the performance of the material and how well it survives my rough use.<br />For now..definitely a buy !!!
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I bought this game for my nephew (9 years old) who loves anything Lego. He has really enjoyed this game and has a lot of fun with it. Definitely worth the buy!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Has an Asimov quality to it, if you like that sort of science fiction. Short and good, a worthwhile read
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Emma stone is a fantastic actress and the story line is awesome. I would definitely recommend this movie for a good laugh.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app surprised me. i didn't read any reviews, so i was surprised when i saw that it could be dimmed, show weather, and had a sleep function.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thought this series sounded a little corny, but decided to give it a try anyway.  Now I'm addicted!  This is an awesome series full of twists and surprises around every corner.  You won't be disappointed!
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Still interesting facts inside even after 12 years since publishing. What comes across as trying &#34; too hard to impress&#34; is the language, kind of sounds insincere here and there. I guess that's just Bourdain's little way of self-indulgence in a time (book's from 2000) when chefs were not such big of celebrities and cooking was not a &#34;reality&#34; sport.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was laughing, crying, gasping and at times holding my breath. You will not regret gettting to know these characters.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Well, I'm a huge Supernatural fan.  The show's great go see it.  If you like horrow movies, it's like a mini horror movie once a week.
B007PVHANM|5.0|My 22 year old son is a Marley fan so I got him this DVD for Christmas.  He loved it.  I also watched it and thought it was very well done, the music is great and there were a lot of interesting things about reggae and Bob Marley that I didn't know about.  It is sad that Bob Marley passed away at such a young age.  The world lost a great talent.
B006P0FIGU|4.0|I like this version of the story, I own most of the others, but this one had a different twist with the intrigue.  Worth the time to see.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am really enjoying this program.  I find it is a higher standard of art and intertainment than what I have seen these past 10 years.  Keep up the good work.  I hope it lasts as there are very few programs left which I enjoy watching with my family.
B008MEM24S|4.0|beat the game and now just waiting for the expansion pack to come to the kindle. hope I don't have to wait long.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|The mouse is adorable, I love him!<br />I have a rooted samsung galaxy note (i717) with stock ics.  The graphics are smooth and beautiful, the game starts out easy to teach toy, them becomes more and more challenging, and I like that.  The puzzles are fun to figure out, and since I adore that mouse so much (especially when he gets the cheese) I try even harder so the cats won&lsquo;t get him!<br />On the downside, (for the devs to fix) the game does not work with the note&lsquo;s s&minus;pen, and I noticed my screen became very hot while playing.  I turned down the brightness and will see if that helps.<br />This game is top&minus;notch, I usually skip games, but since I tried it, I decided it is indeed a keeper just like angry birds!
6304711905|4.0|I like this version of the story it's different than Wyatt Earp and shows a different side to the characters and their relationships.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I am a massive fan of The Hunger Games Trilogy and I have read all three books. I was very excited for the film to be released and went to the midnight premiere, not knowing what to expect. I had heard that the actors and actresses who had been chosen to play the main roles were excellent, so I had some faith. The movie was absolutely incredible. The special effects, the music, the talent of the actors and actresses; everything came together so beautifully.<br /> The score of the movie was absolutely breathtaking and added to the overwhelming emotion of the different scenes of the movie. Needless to say, I cried more than once upon my first time watching the film. It also added incredible suspense to the action-packed arena scenes in the movie. The musical aspect is one of my favorite features of this film.<br /> One negative aspect found in the movie is the fact that some of the details found in the book were not included.  For example: Katniss' conversations with the avoxes, Peeta losing his leg, Katniss receiving the Mockingjay Pin from Madge, and a few more. Although these details are not dire, they do continue on into the second and third books, which may be confusing to some.<br /> Sometimes film adaptations of books can be confusing to those who have not read the book. I think that the concept of the book was explained enough in the very beginning of the movie in The Hunger Games to where others could understand the movie.<br /> The Hunger Games is a phenomenal movie and is definitely worth your time. I ended up seeing it multiple times in theaters and now own it on DVD.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This was one of my favorites in the comic franchise area.  Great dialog and good story - fast paced action and was very entertaining.
B002BRRTUO|3.0|After watching Ted, it reminded me of this movie and I just had to watch it again.  I'm surprised that Max Van Sydow would have played in such a campy version of Flash Gordon, even produced by Dino DeLaurentis.  By today's standards I would expect a lot more from the special effects but even for the time it was pretty bad backgrounds.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Another classic Spielberg fascination with aliens from another world but this one is more akin to E.T. and not Alien, less scary and more interesting.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|My husband bought this for our family of 6 and I was skeptical. Our first night playing it, with our 4, 6 and 8 year old daughters was such fun!  I teamed up with the 4 year old but the others did great and they're ready to play again!  The pieces are pretty small, especially the roads, so you'll want to keep smaller children away.
0765325950|5.0|What can I say but Way to Go Brandon! Thank you for bringing this great series to a Bolero type ending, then the have a cigarette afterwards prologue ending. Still disappointed with the delayed digital release but what the hell, I forgive you Harriet :0) Peace.
0062231375|4.0|Great book, fun different read, really gives you a look at restaurant life from a different perspective. Bourdain is a great descriptive writer.
6305508550|4.0|This one makes me laugh everytime, if you've ever worked in a cubicle you will appreciate the humor and the office politics.
1439152802|4.0|I've become a fan of literary mysteries in recent years, novels that happen to include mystery rather than books that are a \\"whodunit\\" first and a novel second.  Morton is a leader in this genre and her books always promise character and writing, with a mystery that often involves a character trying to unravel her past and her family's history.<br /><br />In The Secret Keeper, Laurel and her siblings are gathering during their mother's final days.  The time pulls Laurel back to a memory she never quite resolved, when she was sixteen and observed her mother stab and kill a man during an otherwise typical family celebration in 1961.  The only other witness was her toddler-age brother.  Laurel works to uncover the story behind this aberration in her otherwise fairly idyllic family life and tries to figure out who Dorothy was before she became devoted to her husband and children.  Laurel's chapters are interspersed with chapters focused on World War Two London as Dorothy comes of age during the terrifying and confusing years of the Blitz.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite Morton book, but I still very much enjoyed it and it gets a solid four stars.  As in her prior works, the mystery is about characters, the secrets that they hold, and the way they come to be who they are.  It is also about how our family's past informs our own present.  I love Morton's language and her ability to create a sense of a time and a place.  I could feel 1940s London and definitely favored those chapters over Laurel's modern day plot (although I was drawn to the character of her only brother).  I didn't always like every character, but that never prevented me from being interested in them.  I had some inklings about the novel's secrets, but some of the twists did catch me by surprise (something I value).<br /><br />Recommended for people for like well-crafted characters and settings.  These elements drive the book and make the reader invest in the novel's mysteries.<br /><br />A copy of the book was provided to me by the publisher but my review is my own honest opinion.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is the fifth G5 game I have purchased for my kindle fire and everyone of them have been lots of fun to play.  I start with the free version and upgrade to the full game.  Downloading takes a little bit but the wait is worth it.  The game has good graphics and an interesting story.  I will continue to purchase G5 games and have introduced them to my family.  Now all of us are hooked.  This game (just like the others) have been well worth the little bit of money I spent and have definitely exceeded my expectations.  Do yourself a tabor and try this game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a very fun and addicting game. I would have given 5 stars, but there are a few problems I found. Sometimes on my Kindle Fire HD the game glitches and freezes for a few seconds and causes me to lose the run. The main problem with the glitch is that it makes me unable to jump which is very annoying. It happens very frequently and I hope that gets fixed. Also, the items in the store are super overpriced. The extra characters are over 20,000 coins and it is hard to even earn 400 coins in one run. Other than that though, the game is very fun and addicting and is similar to Temple Run. I would recommend it for anybody who is a fan of Temple Run and doesn't mind a problem or two. Plus it's free! So go install that game and enjoy! :)
B000E5N6LG|4.0|Good acting and cinemotograhy less than the cost of renting for a few days and worth watching more than once.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read all five books in this series and can't wait for No. 6! The writing is beyond belief. I cared about every single character!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I think this has to be my favorite movie.Its a good romance.It was long but it never lost my attention. I can't wait to get some more like it.
1781163243|5.0|The one real issue I have with it is some art is on 2 pages so you have to look at the crease to get the whole view.
B0009W5JS2|4.0|this is a fairly good sequel to the original, with a change of leading character he doesn't loose any of the attitude or flare.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|“I love it&#34;, BUT…...  The 5 stars are strictly for the outstanding performances by singers, playing of orchestras, and sound quality of  the CD. Disc is, however, wholly lacking  adequate notes, there is No  Synopsis And No Libretto Whatsoever.<br />Is this (and others noted below…) some sort of “cheapie” presentation to account for the highly appreciated low prices offered? A regrettable oversight somewhere along the production line?<br />I Fully expect To Receive From Amazon These Missing Essential  Components shortly.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book but at the end it left me hanging with the last sentance... I love diary of a wimpy kid! I have read them all!
1558908846|5.0|THIS COMPANY IS A GOOD PLACE TO ORDER MOVIES THEY GIVE GOOD SEVICE AND THE TRACKING YOUR ITEM IS GREAT
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not review items often,  but this book is worth your time.  The dialog is wonderful.  I can't tell you how many books I've read with terrible,  predictable dialog and books that have been given five stars that are more like three. This is truly five stars,  especially if you like science fiction. I've already started the next book. A word of caution to parents, the f bomb is dropped in some of the dialog.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great book, took a little while to get me locked in then the second half of the book flew by.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was an interesting perspective as its written from a dogs point of view. The story was great. I couldn't put it down. It made me laugh, cry and even angry at what was happening. As a dog owner, it was an interesting way to look at your own animals and think about the way they act and the way we treat them at times.
B004EJUMT2|4.0|So, this is metal blase edition, don't expect an amazing thing. Still, the product is brand new. If you don't mind to spend more money, go for the first press limited slipcase edition.<br /><br />Hail Ghost!
1451627297|5.0|Got this book for Christmas and I loved it. I read the first chapter when it first came out and i was hooked so when i got it some months later i was excited. As a fan of American history this book was right up my alley. the thought of time travel to change history was fascinating to me. In ending this book is a page turner and i hated for it to end. it was well worth the 849 pages!
B003K16P3M|4.0|Not as good as I expected based on the reviews, but good. I don't think I will read Fire. I might read Bitter Blue.
B0054SMID0|4.0|The strength of this movie is its excellent pacing- it barrels along at a brisk, engaging pace, keeping the viewer interested in what might come next. The legal jargon strikes that sweet spot of being interesting and somewhat complex, without ever going into the mind-numbing realm of the incomprehensible.<br /><br />Of equal significance is the outstanding performance of Matthew McConaughey. He pours on his charisma at full blast, and even though he's a defense lawyer who makes a living of representing the worst scum in the state of Texas, you can't help but like the guy (even before he begins to question the morals of his life choices).<br /><br />As for the plot itself, it's decent- not ground breaking by any means, but this is a solid legal thriller. The mystery aspects are presented in a fairly interesting manner, though the characters' motives can be a bit implausible/nonsensical at times. The \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" is \\"comfort food\\" for people who want to watch a movie that plays out like a John Grisham novel.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|What a great book, loved it. Was riveting to the end. Jodi's style of writing is great, I look forward to her latest,
B004Y042N8|4.0|Definately keeps you thinking..not really into games but ok word word word word word word word word word word word
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is definitely one of my favorite books now. The story is a ball of emotions that somehow leaves you wanting more. I couldn't imagine what it would be like to live Sky's life but I'm so glad I got to be apart of it. Hopeless is a must read!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really tried to make this book last as long as possible because I know it will be awhile before the next book comes out but I couldn't do it. The story is just too compelling to put the book down! Can't wait for the next one!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Kept me interested the whole book.  Good suspense, plot twists, and a love story thrown in to boot.  Sometimes, the whole time travel genre can give me a headache with all of the &#34;Space/time continuum&#34; and &#34;butterfly effect&#34; angles making me feel like I'm trying to understand quantum physics, but King pulls it together in a fun way.  I recommend it to his fans and others.
B005RZB65Q|5.0|As an educator I am intrigued with how the brain works.  This book gives a powerful rationale with ample evidence for how a change in mindset can change your quality of live and create success.  Thoroughly recommended.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a read that is so current to what is actually happening in the world today. Mr. Clancy's research seems to be right on!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Thought provoking, funny, heart warming, sad, inspirational, and thoroughly enjoyable.  Very original. I enjoyed it from start to finish and highly recommend it.
B005PK553C|5.0|Loved it!! It was absolutely amazing. Was a quick delivery and I had no problems with any episodes. Everything turned out great. Highly recommend!
B005LAJ16I|1.0|This was so bad on the language that my 34 year old son MOM do not watch it, you will not like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't say enough about this book.  I have read many books this past year and some of them are so predictable and disappointing. However, this book was anything but that.  I absolutely fell in love with this story and could read it over and over again.  Please buy it.  You will not be disappointed!!!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was an awesome book! Loved it! You should buy this book if you are a fan of Diary Of A Wimpy Kid.  :)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Astronaut Mark Watney is in a planet-sized spot of bother, and author Andy Weir has clearly done his research into NASA, space missions, the Martian environment and problem-solving. This is a fabulous read; the hard-core science and engineering is nicely balanced by Watney's humour and amazing good spirits. Watney is faced with a thousand challenges, which require some very inventive solutions; I found it hard to put the book down when I wanted to see how he would get out of the latest tricky situation. Nice one, Mr Weir!
1451695195|4.0|It is refreshing to hear from a scientist, as they are usually non-believers. I have recommended it to several people.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Typical solid Clancy material with plenty of action and some interesting plot twists but the outcome is always the same and somewhat predictable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great read and I recommend it to any young adult looking for a good and exciting read
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I just love watching this series especially on CD's that I order from Amazon so that I do not have to waste time watching commercials. My time for tv is limited but I can sit for hours that let me relax watching this great show between a write & NY Detective!
145210655X|5.0|I had to get this book for my husband. He is a big Star Wars fan and I am sure our baby boy will love the book once he is here in two months. If I have a girl next I will for sure get one for her too.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|There is enough variety and enough continuity for listening all day.  Norah Jones has always been a favorite but no other album until this one ranked as a favorite since her first.
B0000067L2|5.0|The cover is a sign of the times, and the times were filled with up and down and all around.
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|In many ways this movie succeeds. It creates a sophisticated and often moving portrayal of a precocious and anxious boy, whose dad's died during 9/11. The problems come in more at the margins. For instance, the Dad is a bit too perfect and the  adventures/quest he takes on is largely implausible--or at least unrealistic. That said, those can be lived with; this is fiction after all. But I think my biggest problems came from the child actor. Overall, he was very impressive. His performance was nuanced and sophisticated, but there were still times when it didn't quite work. When his acting felt wooden. And those moments combined with the other two issues just mentioned, detracted a bit too much for me. That said, I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|Great album. Buy this and never look back. Saw them perform when this album came out and it brings back the memories.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Got it for my daughter.  All it does is let you build you house and stuff but after that totally boring.  She love the demo minecraft on the my ipad app because you get the full version and cost the same.  I assume the kindle would be the same but very disappointed.  Not worth the money for two day of fun.  No challenge, want my money.
B0000C23DO|3.0|Like all albums, there are a mix of songs; some you will like more than others. I am sure there are deadheads that like it more than I did.
B000005JEK|5.0|This brings back very good memories. I was 16 when I saw them live in Amsterdam, almost 40 years ago now. I totally forgot about them for many years, until I heard 'Going Home' from this album 'Recorded Live' playing on the radio. It was a major flashback, I just had to have it once again. Great to hear all those awesome songs again, Choo Choo Mama, Good Morning Little Schoolgirl and then of course Slow Blues in 'C'. What am I saying, blues lovers, you can't go without this blues album. Ever. Happy listening!
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I chose this selection because I enjoy writings by this author.  Jodi Picoult holds a reader by not revealing valuable info about the plot until near the end of the book.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this author.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This is both hilarious and informative. Bryson's amuses with his tales of the road in immense Australia, spiced with snippets of unlikely history, politics, and outback oddities. After reading Bryson, I want to go there!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Honestly, if you give a bad rating, then you have insane expectations or no patience.  This is a good game. And I haven't been harassed to spend real cash.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My husband and I missed this at the theater in our small town so I ordered it.  I was not disappointed.  It came in a very timely manner.  It is a very enjoyable movie and the condition truly was good as new.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is like many others out there. Storyline is interesting and game play is a good mix of easy and challenging. I would recommend this game.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a fun, addicting game that is by far the best I have played in a long time. I only wish there where more opportunities to earn or win cash
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I was not a believer but my wife got me to read it.  The book definitely makes you think and provides a good positive platform to start your day.  I would recommend it just for that.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It was free and has a ton of cool editing options and tools. I use it way more often than I probably should lol
B00AFEQA5K|5.0|Very yee-haay. The expiration date of coolness lasts much longer than a typical production line of 'fast food art'.<br />This movie comes with it's own coffin for the xenophobia lovers and haters.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Tom Clancy expands the world of Jack Ryan Jr, and in doing so he steps out of the shadow of his father. No longer is he the bit player to his father.<br />The multiple threads and the detail that we love in a Tom Clancy novel is evident in the book, just enough of the threads are wound up to make a satisfying ending, and the few loose threads leave us wanting some more.
B008M87GJK|1.0|You flashed an advert on my kindle suggesting I download this free app. When I tried to do so I received a message telling me the app is unavailable to me due to \\"geographical restrictions\\". Why bloody bother showing it to me then? Bah.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|An enjoyable read with some mystery to pull the story along.  The characters were well drawn, both likeable and despicable.  I would recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I always knew that Heaven exist. After reading Proof of Heaven it gave me the confidence I longed for in the belief that my departed loved ones are truly happy and at rest in Paradise.
B001BANK32|4.0|But I've been a SK fan for a while. I can definitely see where he matured as a writer.  But this was a fun one to read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was just the perfect conclusion to the Fifty Shades series and I wouldn't have read it if the first 2 weren't so amazing!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was an interesting look into the mind and feelings of a young boy with a facial cranial deformation.  He is so real and absolutely true - you believe he wrote the book.  Has many great lessons to teach all of us. teens to grandparents.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I definitely think that this author is one of the best writers I have come across and would recommend this series to a woman of the RIGHT age group.
B0000DZ3DR|5.0|Clark and Olson are world-class talents, and they work together very nicely. Gene Clark is known for his work with the Byrds but not nearly as well known for his extensive solo career. This CD is as good as anything he did, and he did very good work before his tragic early death. Olson had her own quality career with the Textones before she went solo and deserves a good listen. This CD fits nicely in the Americana genre but shouldn't be limited to it. It's a really good CD
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones should get the Oscar for this one.<br /><br />I've never seen him in this kind of role - a role that most leading men in Hollywood would have eschewed. Who wants to be seen as a wrinkly old curmudgeon accountant? Grr and snore. Yet Tommy Lee Jones plays this role fiercely. Extreme realism. I really disliked his character. It had to be hard for someone so used to playing the hero or the cool guy. Wow, what an actor!<br /><br />Meryl Streep's character was not as complex as I would have liked. Her resolve was simplified down to her one desire to get her man to return to intimacy with her. Life still went on his way, the boring way. I have to say that I cried more than laughed at this movie, and was angry a lot during it. Most women I know want something more out of life than this character did. Even Edith Bunker from \\"All in the Family\\" had more chutzpah than Meryl's character.<br /><br />Still, though a simplistic treatment of a very complex issue, the movie deserves to be watched for Tommy Lee Jones' amazing acting skills and courage to play an unlikable character, and for Mr. Carrell's cagey performance as the shrink who held the steely position necessary to force the couple to work through their process.
1250006341|5.0|I don't watch this show. I bought the book for my mother. She loves it. Here are the extra words you require.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|What more can you ask for - not only does it work well (really well, actually), it's free!  I have this set up on my home PC, my Kindle Fire 2 and my android phone.  It's really great to be able to pair up while I'm at work, then record a show or two while I'm away, then be able to watch them from my Kindle while disconnected from the net.  And pairing this with WoWLAN makes it all the better!
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I am looking forward to reading Dickens again. I have read most of his novels and some<br /> short stories and have always enjoyed his humour. The greatest of all writers.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This is just as great as the 1st 2 MIB's. We love it. Plus it finshes our MIB collection. Until they make another.
0800141660|5.0|Was happy to be able to find and purchase this movie....It is one of my all time favorites. Arrived fast and was in good condition.
0545265355|5.0|My 12 yr old loves this set. She's seen the movie but says the books are dos much better. Any reader will love this set.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A great action packed book. It was hard to put down and read almost half on a coast to coast flight.
B006O6FK2W|5.0|This I found in the stores for $30 so when I saw this I grabbed it bc it was a total steal for the price and the quality was good boys loved it
B007SGM084|5.0|I was resistant in the beginning but as I kept reading it got more interesting. There was more depth and purpose. If there is a trilogy on the male (Christian) perspective I would definitely buy it!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|The Wise Man's Fear is the second book in Patrick Rothfuss' \\"Kingkiller Chronicles\\".  It picks up where the first book left off.  Kvothe continues to give his story to Chronicler to record and in doing so, takes us the reader, on his past adventures.<br />This second book is a monster at a thousand pages.  In my review of the first book in the series, \\"The Name of the Wind\\", I mentioned that Rothfuss' Achilles heal might be that he gets a little long winded.  He continues this in \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" - which is unfortunate because the story is really very good.  Kvothe is an absolutely fascinating character and it's impossible not to root for him.  The other characters in the story are also intriguing and fun to read about.  The university is rich with great characters, sticky politics, crazy instructors and even crazier situations.  It's exactly what you want to read about.<br />Again, Rothfuss' problem is that he doesn't quite have a handle on knowing how much is too much.  The story about Kvothe and the mercenaries tracking the thieves is way too long.  As is Kvothe's time with Felurian, and to a lesser extent, the time he spends training with the Adem.  Each of these have great aspects, but simply take too much time to tell.  Reading through this book is something like eating trail mix.  Overall it's pretty good, but there are some things in there that you could do without that would make it more enjoyable over all.  Sometimes less is more.  With apologies to Rothfuss, because I do believe him to be a solid writer, I can't help but feel like both books in the series would have been better had they been trimmed down a bit.<br /><br />I will certainly read the rest of the series, and at the end of the day, I suppose that's all that really matters.  So anyone interested in some solid fantasy would most likely enjoy this book and the previous one, but make no mistake, Rothfuss is no Brandon Sanderson.
1400067820|4.0|He has a valuable perspective on our world today that really cannot be denied. I might actually like this book a little better than 'Black Swan.'
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never thought that I would ever watch something called The walking Dead, but got addicted immediately.  Season 3 was just as good as 1 and 2 and I cannot wait for season 4.  The back stories are really good and I have become enamored with Norman Reedus (Daryl).  His brother is a monster one loves to hate.  Happy that Rick's wife died as she was becoming tiresome, as was Shane.  Glen is another hero of mine and I hope he lives to the very end.  Want to see the governor get his in a nasty way.  I also adore Michonne and want her to get revenge on everyone.<br /><br />Keep the episodes coming
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is basically 10 hours of Saving Private Ryan.  It is, in my opinion, one of the best war film productions ever made.  At times you feel you are dug into the trenches with these guys and it is really more of a human story rather than the senseless violence often associated with war movies.  Best part is, it is based on a true story and some of the guys are still around to recount what happened.  I really can't say enough good things about it.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|My favorite part of the book are the interesting stories Chris is able to tell based on the interviews and interesting people he's met. The stories are inspiring. The book is laid out well. the material is good, and it's worth a read albeit maybe not at the top of your list.
0765325950|5.0|Great book, Great ending, only problem was that it was too short. Could of used another 25-50 pages at the end. But closes the book very nicely, ending ALL the major questions created from the one before. Sad to see it end.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is the best fantasy I've read in years. I could not put it down. It was a little preachy sometimes, but only in very short spurts. I can't wait for the next installment.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I found this by following a \\"People who like this also like...\\" and was not disappointed.  \\"Ho Hey\\" and \\"Stubborn Love\\" easily were my favorites.  Hope to hear more from them!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|hubby and I take turns playing. Grandchildren play also great for all ages 7 to 70 challenging fun for all
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was very well written. I did not want to put this book down and think I read it within a day or two. Just when you think you have the story figured out, it's the complete opposite. Loved it!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Loved it in the movie theater.  Rendition of old Scotland very good; characters interesting, especially heroines triplet brothers who provide most of comic relief.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's a glimpse of possibilities I couldn't see before. Taught me how to see the good and bad in everyone and simply capture the \\"beauty.\\"<br /><br />As much as life is full of sorrow, pain, and incomprehensible tragedy, it offers the chance of acceptance, healing, and peace.<br /><br />For anyone who wants to believe in love. And sex.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br /><br />BUT why no closure with Breckin and 6?
B0083H6AQA|4.0|I thought that the movie's plot was interesting, not all predictable, and it was different to see Rob Pattinson play such a cad (in period costume, no less!).  A movie with strong women characters and Rob in the middle of it all.  Those who loved him as Edward in the Twilight series may not appreciate him in this movie, where Rob's character is so self-centered and greedy.  In my opinion, Edward fans would be better served rewatching the Twilight movies or as a sympathetic supporting character in the Harry Potter &#34;Goblet of Fire&#34; movie.  .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time started out like every other love story but is like nothing else I have ever read amazing!
0345536886|4.0|This book was a gift so I can't review it.  All I know is that he enjoyed it very much.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is first, great with graphics and sounds! It truly puts you to the test of directing and managing the characters actions. I can't wait for more of this game!
0385535147|4.0|This book was also a gift so I don't know if he has had a chance to read it or not.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Very good read. Fans of this series will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Lee Child has once again brought us a book that you just cant put down.
0802473156|5.0|I believe every big concept regardless of difficulty can be made easy to understand by making it simplier.  Find the truth of the matter and drive it home.  Books that inspire by long winded chapters that at the time seem very inspirational are often forgotten because it is to hard to hold onto the concept that is so thought provoking.  The 5 love languages gives you something that covers the whole truth of how people want to be loved, but it is also something that I don't think you will ever forget because it's made so simple.  It is easy to remember, understand and not hard to practice improving in one of the 5.  It's also not hard to figure out which one of the love languages your signifigant other is.  I think this would have really helped my second marriage.  I was always a good husband in the since that I always treated my wife with kind words.  But I think she needed another love language.  Now I have a great insight to my 3rd!  What a lucky lady she will be! lol.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Reacher fans will be impressed to see that Lee Child has once again outdone the previous books by having this great new read! Excellent storyline and characters. Worth every cent!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Challenging and fun game! Love it! Couldn't stop playing until I was finished! Best hidden object game so far.<br /><br />A++++++++++++++++++++
B005POK858|3.0|Eve of the Genesis is a well executed straight forward turned-based RPG. Its strengths are its minimal learning curve, opportunity for extensive customization of equipment and skills, and its tightly controlled completely linear progression which protects the player from missables and getting lost. Its weaknesses are its lack of character development and minimal story. The game is in all these respects similar to Symphony of Eternity. My comments here are based on the game as played with a stylus on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />The good technical points include: most items are easy to find, although there are a few that are well hidden; there are a few locations designed for easy level grinding, if that is your preference; fairly early in the game there is monster item drop that allows you to escape from random battles; you can save anywhere except in battles; there are multiple save slots.<br /><br />The weaknesses are the inability to 'teleport' out of most dungeons, and the scarce resources needed to improve skills.  This scarcity means that a misguided choice made with minimal information is difficult to overcome.  However, the basic game is easy enough that you probably will not suffer from a mistake.  Resources become plentiful in the post game bonus time.  Some of the item drops are very rare, and one problem is that without browsing the forums, you might very well not realize that good items, like the \\"escape shoes,\\" can be gotten from a particular monster.<br /><br />I feel compelled to mention the lamest \\"game over\\" conclusion I can recall.  After what can be a long and tough battle against the final bosses in the post game bonus (the battle can be easy if you level up and know what skills to use), your victory awards you a single pop up message.  You don't get a cut scene, nor animated credit rolls, or anything to celebrate your success.<br /><br />The graphics are adequate, but no more that that, and the sound is repetitive.<br /><br />The interface istouch screen menu based, and not the 'touch and go' design of Symphony of Eternity.<br /><br />If you like controlled, easy to learn and play turn-based role playing games, then you should enjoy Eve of the Genesis.  The basic game will go by quickly, perhaps too quickly (hence my title that mentions price),  and although some grinding is necessary for the bonus post game bosses, you shouldn't find success difficult to achieve.
B007N85POS|5.0|I am an Angry Birds addict so I am enjoying this game.  I got it for my grandchildren originally but play it myself also.  They play the game whenever they come to see me.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've been reading Stephen King since the seventies, and one thing that always amazes me is how easily he gets you to suspend your disbelief.  You start reading this book and you completely accept the premise--that a magic door to 1958 exists in a pantry.  And you can change the future if you go through that door, but if you go through again it's an automatic reset, and all your changes are erased.<br /><br />This is a book about history, and trying to change something terrible, which actually might have been for the best.  You just don't know, because that's history for you.  Wanna kill Hitler?  Well, Hitler was power mad and crazy.  What if you killed Hitler and the follower who replaced him decided not to invade Russia, or England, but just concentrated on solidifying Germany's power over Europe?  What then?<br /><br />A lot of the strength of this book comes from its ability to immerse you in the culture of the 1950's, and the miserable life of Lee Harvey Oswald.  I take it as a given at this point that King's strength with plot and atmosphere is not matched in his creation of characters.  There are some standouts, but in general his characters tend to run together in my head.  It's not his strong suit.  But as plot to a very great extent IS character, this is forgivable.<br /><br />A very good, but not a great book.  It is not &#34;The Shining&#34; which did have strong characters as well as a strong plot and atmosphere.  But it's very good.
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|I love chris brown's music. This was good but i was expected more upbeat songs with good beats like turn up the music or don't wake me up. Still very good though! Not hating! He still brought it with this album.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|As usual another good book by Michael (RIP) with kudos going to the authors involved with finishing the story. Good book and would recommend.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you love war related books this is a MUST!! I'm not a big reader but saw this book and had to get it.  I couldn't put it down!!!  There's a movie out based on this book and I recommend it but only after reading the book.  It's like you're watching a movie in your head as you read it.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar is a must see in Blu-ray 3D!!!  The effects are absolutely amazing and the scenery is gorgeous!  Get it today!
B001FW58D6|5.0|Great series! If you like X-Files you will like Fringe.  Watched all the seasons on Amazon Prime and didn't want it to end.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it!! It does just what I need it to do :)<br />I like knowing when I need to plug in. It helps for school, this way I'm always ready. Great App!!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is a very real portayal of a midle aged woman sinking into dementia. The depiction is frightening but sympathetic.  The confusion her family feels as well as what she feels is clearly depicted.  But family love is the key here to the acceptance of the disease by all. This was very relevant to me--my mother too  is sinking deeper into this same disease, and I was reminded of how little time we may have left to effectively commmunicate.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! It is so easy to use, even for this electronically challenged person!  It's like the old, simple calculators we used before the complicated onesw became so common. The numbers are big enough to easily use.  If all you need is simple math, this is the one for you!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I cannot stress enough how amazing this book is - I'm telling anyone who will listen. I will say that the first 50 or so pages were a struggle for me to get through, but you end up appreciating it later on as the story develops. Stick with it - you'll thank yourself!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  It was interesting and captivating from the first page.  Once I started reading,  couldn't put it down.  I am so excited about the upcoming movie release.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like being able to have this at my hands at all times. Great to be able to look up certain verses.

B004D9FLJE|5.0|Nothing better than watching the complete 1st season of GLEE with my kids on a Sunday!<br />Great bonding time.had by ALL!!!
B003L1ZWG2|3.0|This movie is good, but not great. Yes, it is original in the fact that the threat is nature and not someone chasing you or something.  How much plot can there be to this type of scenario?  It does get boring because let's face it, 90% of the movie is filmed on one scene. This is a plot where it makes a great survivor story but not great movie.  Check it out for yourself, you may like it more, but it's not something I recommend.  I'm torn between it being a waste of your time or worth your time...you decide.
0792838068|4.0|the story is a bit arsh, it's sometimes rough to look at but well done, I would recomand it only to people who know about alcoolism.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We bought this mobile for our 9-week old daughter, and she loves watching it. The outer leaves that open and close around the animals on the inner leaves is an excellent feature. I was worried that the plush animals would look cheap, but they are very cute, especially the frog and monkey. The music options are all great and not annoying like some baby toys. As for battery life, we have used the mobile at least once every day for 3 weeks and no sign of needing to change them. This mobile may not be a good choice if you are looking for a sleeping aid- we use it during wake time because it has quite the opposite effect on our daughter. Overall, one of our best baby purchases and definitely worth the $29 we paid for it on Amazon.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I didnt expect much from this movie but it surprised me. It has good character development and is not too tongue and cheek the way some super hero movies are.  Nicolas Cage even played the perfect part for himself. IT's good.
B007712XAU|5.0|Have been wanting to see what all the fuss is about.... Well worth it, very entertaining show. I was able to watch it just before season 3 started....
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn creates characters that are believable, real and pitiable. Unlike many writers, Flynn avoids formulaic plots and overly familiar scenarios. For fans of \\"Gone Girl\\" this US an equally satisfying read.
B005HSL626|5.0|I've heard many things about this game so I decided to try it. It's very fun and addicting. But I wonder , why not vegetables?
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am still learning this game.  I have really enjoyed it so far.  It can be agggravateing.  I have not played all if the levels yet.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Really great series, and book. The numeber one aspiring fantasy author these days. You should definitely give this a try if you enjoy the genre. At the same time it's far from your typical generic fantasy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I spend a lot of time with solitaire.  I fill time by playing.  If I am waiting on someone it helps the time go faster and takes my mind off of the waiting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved how the story developed and the characters. I couldn't put it down! It's not on a bestseller list, so I was weary, but it should be!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|If you're looking for a new sci-fi story, give this a try.  Compelling, and well written from an independent author.  Looking forward to the other books that follow as well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has managed to capture the challenges, experiences and humor of living with cancer.  Everything about the novel rings true.  It helps us all understand that despite the huge effect their cancer has on their lives, their relationships, and their family dynamics, they are individuals experiencing life as they know it.  You want to get to know them.  I couldn't put it down.  Thanks for such a great read.  Karin
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|you've probably already seen the movie, so you know it's good :)<br /><br />I bought it as a gold box deal.  worth every penny

B0011MZOEI|5.0|Excellent movie with plenty of action.  Story keeps moving non-stop, good characters - including the villian(s).  I recommend this movie - especially to Diehard fans - this movie definitely kicks as* and is the best of the series thus far.
B0058DDVXW|1.0|I bought this item yes it took almost two months to get to me. And I use a ps3 to watch movies and this DVDs format is not being supported by the ps3! And so I plug in my DVD player and it says wrong format on the side is the screen!! We waiting about 5 minutes and it starts by itself. Overall it becomes a issue cus of the format of the DVD cd. Very unsatisfied!!!

B004ZN9RWK|5.0|My favorite album of all time.  A true rock masterpiece.  It's experimental.  It's filled with weird noises and sound effects.  It's loud and mellow at the same time.  It's completely over the top.  It's epic and brilliant.  It's the Dark Side....<br />This is the eighth studio record by Pink Floyd.  It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and released in March of 1972.  It did well right from the start on stayed on Billboard's charts for an impressive 741 weeks.  It has been estimated that over 50 million copies have been sold and so stands as one of the most successful records of all time.<br /><br />And it earns all this and then some.  Thematically the record flows well.  The songs couple into each other.  They cover some very deep subjects too such as greed (Money), isolation (Us and Them), mental illness (Brain Damage), and even the futility of life itself (Speak To Me).<br />The album also rocks musically.  Time is such a great tune.  The guitar and added effects are extremely well done.  Add in the lyrics and you have a piece of rock history!  Money is another song that just plain rocks.  You're immediately intrigued as it starts because of the sound of money clinking and a cash register opening.  Then 18 seconds in the unforgettable bass kicks in.  Classic!<br /><br />The record also clicks when it comes to the recording as well.  The band spent a lot of time experimenting with different sounds and loops.  It doesn't detract from the music though, but instead it flows right along with the music forming a wall of sound.  The harmonies are also impressive too.  Two standout moments are Us And Them and Time.  Both songs showcase how well Wright and Gilmour could harmonize with each other.  And Clare Torry's vocals on The Great Gig In The Sky make that track unforgettable as well.<br /><br />But more than just that, when you say an album is the greatest of all time, you've got to say it has an enduring legacy as well.  And does this recording stand up to that test?  And how!  The album won Grammys.  Some of the profits from the record where used to fund the classic movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail!  Thank you Pink Floyd!  It also has influenced musicians since it's release.  The Flaming Lips collaborated with Henry Rollins, Peaches, Stardeath and White Dwarfs to do their own version to Dark Side.  Radiohead's OK Computer (also on this top ten list!) has been called the Dark Side of the Moon for the 1990s.  It explored similar themes and has the same experimentation and grand scale of this record.  Further bands such as Dream Theater have even preformed the whole record live!  And unless you live in a while in the ground, you had to have heard the rumor of the connection between TDSOTM and The Wizard Of Oz.  While the band denies that there is any connection, it's still fun to sync them up.  That should be on everyone's bucket list.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?  If you don't have it already, don't hesitate to pick of this masterpiece.t?  And how!  The album won Grammys.  Some of the profits from the record where used to fund the classic movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail!  Thank you Pink Floyd!  It also has influenced musicians since it's release.  The Flaming Lips collaborated with Henry Rollins, Peaches, Stardeath and White Dwarfs to do their own version to Dark Side.  Radiohead's OK Computer (also on this top ten list!) has been called the Dark Side of the Moon for the 1990s.  It explored similar themes and has the same experimentation and grand scale of this record.  Further bands such as Dream Theater have even preformed the whole record live!  And unless you live in a while in the ground, you had to have heard the rumor of the connection between TDSOTM and The Wizard Of Oz.  While the band denies that there is any connection, it's still fun to sync them up.  That should be on everyone's bucket list.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?  If you don't have it already, don't hesitate to pick of this masterpiece.

0817439390|2.0|I bought this book with the understanding that it was for amateur photographers with digital SLR camera or traditional SLR camera and that it would help you to better understand the technique of photography but I was still very confused after reading. The instructions that Bryan Peterson gave in the exercises just didn't seem to work with my camera. I just didn't seem to learn anything that I could put to use. I feel this would be better enjoyed by a photography student instead of someone trying to learn on their own.

B0006ZFQP8|3.0|In nearly all modern recordings of Tristan, the central \\"characters\\" are the conductor and orchestra. The greatness of a performance has to be judged by their depth, passion and commitment. If one or more great singers participates, it is a boon. Long gone are the days when Melchior and Flagstad could carry the work entirely on their shoulders, even with sub-standard orchestral contributions.<br />One can see this quite clearly in the latest and probably last studio recording done by Domingo and Pappano. Here the star is the tenor, beyond doubt; but Pappano's demure conducting spoils the recording as a performance of the work. It never even comes close to reaching for the stars.<br />In any case, most recorded conductors are fully aware of their responsibility; and some go decidedly over the top. One is Solti, whose reading is one unremitting paroxysm of (albeit glorious) sound. Despite a magnificent Birgit Nilsson in the cast, this is a recording for those who put the singing in second place. To some extent the same criteria apply to the present recording. Kleiber and the Staatskapelle do not yield to their Viennese rivals in sheer passion, precision or commitment, though it is not quite as overheated as Solti. Actually Kleiber's judgement of sonority seems more balanced, his climaxes a little more judiciously placed. Take e.g. the orchestral interlude in Act II, just before the lovers meet: Solti whips up the orchestra to a brass-heavy inferno that has you gasping and might give you a nervous break-down. Kleiber keeps the singers in mind, whose entry must not be an anti-climax. This, more or less, characterises their difference in approach.<br />Mind you: having put this perspective on it, Kleiber's thrives just as much on orchestral sonority. If your main interest is in the singing, you will be disappointed. Take the chief character, Tristan. This is René Kollo, a most unfortunate choice, much worse than Solti's puppy dog Fritz Uhl. At least Uhl can sing. But Kollo has a dull voice without a top, without the strength to sustain the long flow of arioso, and as far as vocal acting is concerned, the less said the better: He consistently confuses high drama with vaudeville; and his Act III monologue is a patch quilt of histrionics that either leaves you cold or in pained disbelief. It seems plain from comparison with any other recorded tenor that Kollo just doesn't know how to handle the role. Fischer-Dieskau is much better, gruff and forthright and bluntly unsubtle - but this is what the role demands. However his voice is no longer what it used to be and has an unpleasant dullness (matching Kollo perfectly; and so we have two dull males whereas Kollo's voice should ring). Kurt Moll and Brigitte Fassbaender are good, but a long way from wholly adequate. Moll sings beautifully, but he seems unable to catch the noble eloquence that is so crucial here; he sounds too matter of fact to me, i.e. just a cheated husband, not a regal authority whose trust has been abused. Fassbaender also seems unable to get her voice around the devotion to her lady that defines her character.<br />Which leaves us with Isolde and Margaret Price. She is the best of a highly problematic cast; but the richness of her voice can deceive. Let me say in extenuation of not being a Flagstad or Nilsson, that at any rate she gives a convincing portrayal and is vocally capable without undue straining. Not the Isolde of my dreams, but good enough to hold her own against most other recorded Isoldes.<br />In sum: a very problematic recording. I suspect that the best one can say is this: For fans of Heldentenor singing, there is Vickers and then Domingo. For fans of Isolde there are Flagstad and Nilsson ex aequo. All others singers of those roles are a clear step down the rungs. No stereophonic Tristan has matched a top-flight tenor and soprano. (What wouldn't I give to have a recording of Vickers and Nilsson!).<br />So this is a conductorial Tristan. Is it the best?Well, I for one can't see how it could stand above Karajan, Bernstein or Barenboim. All three have much better casts. By the same token, Kleiber has the measure of the orchestral canvas in that indefinable way that can't be described in words - he is not predominantly after beauty, he does not squeeze the passion out of it to the last drop, nor does he emphasise sensuousness at the cost of a panoramic structure. I've already noted that he scores over Solti in this respect; but to some extent this is also the merit that commands attention in comparison with Karajan, Bernstein, Barenboim.<br />My own sense of its level of achievement is, that for all the virtues of Kleiber and the Staatskapelle (and DG's engineers in capturing a handsome soundscape), the singing is really not up to this standard. If you are a collector (like me) you will not wish to do without it. But if you are looking for your first or second complete recording, this cannot be recommended over the three last-named rivals - with Karajan (who has Vickers in the cast) edging the others out by a small margin).
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I love books that remind me of that first love, that first look, that first touch..and Lauren Oliver makes such a good job about writing that! This is a must read!
0316066524|1.0|What a terrible, terrible tome. I hesitate to call it just a book, as it is more akin to a doorstop in both size and what it is made of. If you want the same level of content, go to the lumbar yard and buy a block of wood. You will get the same amount of dead tree with 1/10 of the hassle.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved this book!.. I was very reserved regarding its material because I was expecting to find another 50 shades of gray. But I was found with a different story and I loved it!! It is different, and a little bit more real than fifty. I would defenetly recommend this book if you are into the whole erotic romance thing!

B0073LWEXK|5.0|While I never got to play Myst myself, I watched others and this little app/game is right along that play-style.  Figure out the puzzle (or consult the spoiler guide if you start to pull your hair out), advance through stages, and utilize the ability to change the season (Fall/Spring/Summer/Winter) to access new puzzles.<br /><br />Game saves as you go so you can play it quickly or at a relaxed pace when you are killing time.<br /><br />I got this as a FAOTD, but it is certainly worth its normal price.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|I don't know what I could be doing wrong, I'm fairly smart when it comes to tech and software. I went through the 9 pages of the tutorial and read the help.  I've tried this 2 different ways for a total of 5 times tonight and a couple of times one day about a week ago and didn't have time that day to look into it.  One way I've tried is I took the picture, then it was automatically in crop mode, so I'd crop it, click the check mark, next it would say it's trimming the image, then the image would disappear, the screen went back to the camera mode. I can no longer find the image I just took and cropped.  Twice I tried it by not cropping it; I took the picture, clicked the checkmark, again, it went back to the camera mode.  I just tried it 3 more times and i give up.  I spent way too much time on this tonight.  I won't uninstall it now, I'll try it once more another day, if I can get it to work I'll update this review.  I don't know why it's working for just about everyone else.  I haven't read any of the bad reviews, so I don't know what those say.  I'm definitely not paying for the paid version if I can't get the free one to work for me.  I'm very frustrated now because of all the time I've wasted on this and now I need to install my old scanner on my computer since this app won't work.  If the developer reads this and wants to reply to me, I created an this address 'camscanner at trashmail dot net'.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|It's A Wonderful Life (1946), originally made for Liberty Films, is one of the most popular and heartwarming films ever made by director Frank Capra. Frank Capra regarded this film as his own personal favorite - it was also James Stewart's favorite of all his feature films.<br /><br />It was actually a box-office flop at the time of its release, and only became the Christmas movie classic in the 1970s due to repeated television showings at Christmas-time when its copyright protection slipped and it fell into the public domain in 1974 and TV stations could air it for free. [Republic Pictures restored its copyright claim to the film in 1993, with exclusive video rights to it. Currently, it can be shown only on the NBC-TV network, and its distribution rights belong to Paramount Pictures.]

B0018QPPXW|5.0|A young man gets conned into answering erotic personals by a friend and hooks up with Lana who turns his house into a money making ladies whorehouse while his parents are on vacation. Atmospheric and brings chills to anyone who has experienced being home alone and briefly turning the home into a party place. Excellent performances by all and although Lana shines, this is Joel's story, & a top notch Tom Cruise delight all the way.
0143120255|5.0|I love the artwork in this book and was excited to finally get a physical copy of the beautiful images. I do love this cute little book. However, I was surprised by the size of it (it is about the size of a small hardcover novel). There is however a larger version in print now.
B0090SI4HO|5.0|\\"Governator Ah'-nold\\" is back. This R-rated action flick is targeted strictly for the fans of R-rated action flicks; I was surprised to discover that I am one of them! This fast-paced bullet-riddled comedy is entertaining from the first frame. I've never laughed through a bloody shoot-out before but our screening audience had a great time. Korean director Jee-woon Kim (\\"The Good, the Bad and the Weird\\") brings chop-socky experience and a great sense of humor to the screen with non-stop, cliché-ridden energy.<br /><br />All the humor is character driven, so let's talk about the characters:<br />  * Arnold Schwarzenegger (\\"The Expendables\\") is a weary sheriff in a little bitty (fictitious) Arizona border town, just putting in his time until retirement. He saw enough action in Los Angeles and was tired of blood, so he has moved here to relax.<br />  * Luis Guzman (\\"Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\\") is his chief deputy. He's not a coward, but he IS a realist, so when they hear that a high-powered jefe from a drug cartel is headed their way, he's thinking maybe they could look the other way \\"just for a little while...\\"<br />  * Zach Gilford (\\"Crazy Kind of Love\\") is one of our hero's hapless deputies. The first thing he does is break his nose while target shooting because he doesn't expect a high-caliber pistol to kick.<br />  * Jaimie Alexander (\\"Thor\\") is another deputy, scared spitless, but she's game.<br />  * Johnny Knoxville (Lots of TV) is one of the local yokels who volunteers to help our hero; but this gun lover INSISTS on being deputized. I laughed at his metal military helmet dangling on a rope as he is helped to cover.<br />  * Eduardo Noriega (\\"Blackthorn\\") is that aforementioned jefe, skillfully driving a singularly designed Corvette muscle car. He is smart, tough and determined.<br />  * Forest Whitaker (\\"Repo Men\\") is with the FBI; the stunningly clever jailbreak happens on his watch and he WILL bring back his prisoner, the most wanted drug kingpin in the Western hemisphere.<br />  * Genesis Rodriguez (\\"Casa de mi Padre\\") is a lovely FBI agent taken hostage by that nasty escapee.<br /><br />We have memorable thugs, a wonderful assortment of townspeople (some of whom have great reasons to stay in the diner), muscle cars, great use of a corn field, unlimited firepower, lots of blood, several humorous through lines that pop up at just the right moment, one little kiss and some appropriate profanity. I'm putting this one in my Guilty Pleasures file and look forward to Amazon telling me when I can get it on DVD.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a great book, once you started you couldn't put it down.  Looking forward to the movie release in February.
B005S9ELVC|2.0|This is a violent, bloody R-rated territorial squabble set in the late 1940s between the Los Angeles Police Department and the Mickey Cohen/Bugsy Siegel East Coast Mob. This humor-laced (and bullet-ridden) outing pits East Coast gangsters against ...hmm... not really a Dirty Dozen, more like a Slightly Soiled Six-Pack, of cops who have been anonymously recruited to run organized crime out of Los Angeles.<br /><br />This is a highly fictionalized story inspired by real events. We see:<br />  * Sean Penn (\\"Milk\\") is Mickey Cohen, a former professional boxer with a nasty temper, brutal and merciless. I must say, Penn has become a caricature of himself....and he has NEVER learned to enunciate!<br />  * Nick Nolte (\\"Warrior\\") is Police Chief Parker, the guy determined to keep Cohen and his cohorts from setting up shop in LA.<br />  * Josh Brolin (\\"W.\\") is Sgt. John O'Mara, an Army vet, now a cop for the LAPD. He is hand-picked for the job, and he in turn hand picks his own squad (with some help from his wife).<br />  * Ryan Gosling (\\"Drive\\") is Sgt. Jerry Wooters, who first declines the \\"honor\\" of serving on the team, but then he gets mad... (with the Hollywoodland real estate development sign shining in the background.)<br />  * Emma Stone (\\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\") is Grace, a favorite of Cohen's; Sgt. Wooters likes her, too.... Vintage clothing looks good on this gal!<br />  * Robert Patrick (\\"Trouble With the Curve\\") is Max, otherwise known by this little gang as \\"Hopalong\\" because a six-gun is his weapon of choice.<br />  * Michael Peña (\\"End of Watch\\") is Navidad, who nominates himself to join up when Max is recruited.<br />  * Giovanni Ribisi (\\"Avatar\\") is Conway, a technician who is invited into the project because he understands telecommunications...and our geek accepts because he would like to be a hero to his son.<br />  * Anthony Mackie (\\"The Hurt Locker\\") is Coleman, the only law in his tough neighborhood. He just wants to stay OUT of Burbank!<br />  * Yvette Tucker (\\"Me Again\\") does a perfectly splendid turn as Carmen Miranda, complete with a towering headgear of fruit, singing at Slapsy Maxie's nightclub during a raid.<br /><br />This shoot-em-up is almost non-stop gunfire interspersed with blowie uppie stuff. There isn't as much profanity as usual, but the vehicular mayhem is sorta fun with those big old 40s vintage cars swaying and lurching around corners.<br /><br />Be sure to suspend disbelief, but be prepared to laugh more often than you might expect. Despite all the blood and gore, the screening audience was mildly entertained, and that's what it's all about, ...isn't it? ...Maybe? Amazon will notify me when this is available on DVD so I can notify my folks on JayFlix.net.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great entertainment without unnecessary violence, profanity and nudity.  Excellent job PBS!  Can't wait to finish it and start watching season 3.
B0090SI4FG|2.0|A former cop with the New York City Police Department had been double-crossed and framed; seven years later he is hired by the mayor to track a (possibly) unfaithful wife.... Why does this sound so familiar?<br /><br />...Sigh...There is nothing new in this l-o-n-g (109 minutes) R-rated action-filled mess. Dirty cops, corrupt politicians, unfaithful wives, deadbeat customers, you know the drill. My biggest problem was finding someone I could root for! Maybe that darling secretary? Maybe the lover?<br /><br />I watched:<br />  * Mark Wahlberg (\\"The Fighter\\") is Billy. We want to root for him, but we can't forget those first scenes.<br />  * Russell Crowe (\\"Les Misérables\\") is Mayor Hostetler. His phony smile can't disguise that little twitch under his left eye when he is tense.<br />  * Jeffrey Wright (\\"Source Code\\") is Police Commissioner Fairbanks, who has me confused: is he clean or is he dirty?<br />  * Catherine Zeta-Jones (\\"Rock of Ages\\") is Cathleen, the Mayor's wife. Is she or isn't she faithful?<br />  * Kyle Chandler (\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\") is Paul, a political operative who is, believe it or not, the most decent guy in the whole movie.<br />  * Alona Tal (Lots of TV) is Katy, Billy's Girl Friday in his private detective business. She's sweet and resourceful.<br /><br />Expect gunshots, fisticuffs, vehicular mayhem and LOTS of talk, which, I was surprised to note, includes very little profanity. The R rating seems to be due to the violence of some of those fist fights. It struck me as funny that everyone is constantly drinking but absolutely no one smokes.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't find this movie very involving; most of the characters seemed to be at arms-length. The talky script is Brian Tucker's first time out, so next time Mr. T. try the less-is-more rule and use two words instead of twenty, okay? Especially when you have them speak sotto voce and many of us in the audience can't make out most of that blasted dialogue. If you get the DVD from Amazon.com, at least it will have closed captions.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I have always liked Rod Stewart's music.  Great Christmas album!!!!  Can't wait until next Christmas to blast it again!!!! Can't go wrong with buying this album.
B008220BLG|4.0|Seattle's Isaac Marion (self-published \\"Where Are They Now\\") wrote the book on which this goofy (and unconventional) romantic comedy (with ZOMBIES?!) is based. Director Jonathan Levine (\\"50/50\\") did the honors at the helm.<br /><br />Despite a pretty standard opening with the walking dead lurching through a demolished city looking (and finding!) humans on which to munch, this gradually evolves into a laugh-out-loud comedy and a sweet romance. You'll just have to trust me! (The tag line is: Cold Body, Warm Heart.)<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Nicholas Hoult (\\"About a Boy\\") is R, for lack of a better name; he just can't remember... He seems to have the right instincts (I want to protect her, not eat her), but is extremely confused (How do you talk to a girl?).<br />  * Teresa Palmer (\\"I Am Number Four\\") is Julie. Their balcony scene made me wonder if his full name was Romeo. This actress bears an uncanny resemblance to a blonde Kristen Stewart.<br />  * John Malkovich (\\"RED\\") is Julie's father, General Grigio, who heads the human defense forces in their walled fortress, fighting zombies and skeletors.<br />  * Dave Franco (\\"21 Jump Street\\") is Perry, one of the armed defenders of the besieged humans. Yes, he's James Franco's younger (handsomer) brother.<br />  * Analeigh Tipton (\\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\") is Nora, Julie's friend. She offers her cosmetics when they try to disguise our hero as a human, not a corpse. She says, \\"I know it's hard to get a boyfriend, what with the apocalypse and all, but...\\"<br />  * Rob Corddry (Lots of TV) is M, R's best friend, if there even IS such a thing in the zombie world.<br /><br />All of us were involved in this upbeat comedy from the get-go. We were surprised the first time we laughed because of the dystopian setting, but got the hang of it very quickly.<br /><br />Expect a circumspect courtship, lots of gunshots and blood, very little vehicular mayhem or profanity and NO blowie uppie stuff.<br /><br />Just suspend disbelief and havea good time! Amazon will tell me when I can order my DVD.

0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere was the very first Neil Gaiman book I've ever read. I stumbled upon it accidentally at a time when I did not know who Neil Gaiman was. I was home sick with nothing to do. I saw a copy of Neverwhere in my living room. My dad's copy that he left last time he visited. I picked it up, started reading, and could not put it down. Finished the book in two days in between fever-sleeping. Yes, even Neil Gaiman's writing is not strong enough to ward off sleepiness caused by fever and meds. But, it was strong enough to keep me lucid enough to remember to resume reading upon waking up. Neverwhere is that one book that allowed me to think of possibilities out of impossibilities. I was 23 when I first read a Neil Gaiman book. I was starting a new career as a designer. Neverwhere inspired me to think out of the box. It inspired me to follow Neil Gaiman's example of dreaming possibilities out of impossibilities.<br /><br />One other thing this book allowed me to do? It made me respect DOORS.

1457514508|4.0|\\"The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club\\" was fun and entertaining. The beginning starts out a little slower, but quickly increases in intensity and intrigue. The author of this book has a way of giving his readers a look at the darker side of humor without making you cringe and wonder if you should read the rest of the book. There were parts of this book that made me laugh out loud and I think I smiled most of the time I spent reading it. If you find it difficult to follow books where there are a lot of characters, this book might hang you up a little at first, but stick with it. This book is really worth it.<br /><br />When I finished this book, I kind of felt like I was on the set of Desperate Housewives with Cesar Millan while reading an Agatha Christie mystery. Reading this is so much fun and the descriptions of the dogs and their behavior is done so well you can't help but love it. I also found this more enjoyable than other mysteries because the plot keeps changing up so that you never quite know what is going to happen next, and that kept me turning pages regardless of whatever was going on in the environment I was in. The author is one I would read another title from. I recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs and a good read. Great cover too, made me want to read it.<br /><br />I received a free digital copy of this book for my honest review. No other compensation was received and my opinions are my own and are not influenced by the publisher or the author.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|brutal, intense, dystopian, and Dredd's helmet is never removed once - nice!<br />The impressive thing was how subtly Dredd is humanized and turns out to be likeable as a fair-minded and tough lawman in the most wild of wild-west locales, not because he seeks to subjigate the weak or dominate opponents but because Mega-City One is teetering on the edge of collapse and the Law is the last strand of a decaying and frayed rope holding society in place.<br />Early in the movie it's set up quite well how hopeless the task of maintaining the law in this sprawling sea of urban decay maintaining an ever simmering tension just under the surface of every conversation and every action sequence.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I replaced my now 5 year old Medusa headset with these.  I always thought the Medusas sounded pretty good for being headphones, but I was very impressed by how much better these sound, even though they are virtual surround.  The noise canceling is good, but not fantastic; it's not really that noticeable, but if you rub the mic you can hear your finger even if the loopback is turned off in the software, so obviously there IS some active noise canceling going on.  The range is quite good.  My computer is upstairs in the front of the house and I have to go all the way down stairs and almost out the back door before I lose signal.  Battery life is, as always, massaged a bit, but I seem to get 6-8 hours on a charge consistently.  I have seen it posted elsewhere, but it's worth mention, that these DO work with a mac, the only thing you lose is the virtual surround (logitech! Make a Mac driver!)<br /><br />I can't speak to longevity yet.  The pictures one of the people posted that they claim to be 1 year of regular wear kind of scares me.  But honestly that looks more like they were carried around a backpack...or a dog got them...or something outside of standard wear.
B0076DELIG|5.0|interesting story. connelly up to his usual story telling. it is interesting that he is aging harry and his daughter is growing and developing. worth the read.
0765325950|4.0|I really loved this book. I read it - it took me quite some time; it is not exactly small - and for the most part, I really loved it. There are things I don't like about it, of course, but overall Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson did a really good job with it. The way that the Last Battle is portrayed - how it is fought - was extremely cleverly done. It was perfect. The maneuvers of all of the forces of the shadow were all terrifying and the retribution from all of the forces of light were satisfying.<br /><br />That said, there were some quirks... I don't really want to point them out because of spoilers, but I'll say that a few threads from previous books were left loose. Nothing major, but enough to be annoying. The other complaint I have is that after the Last Battle is fought and won, the aftermath is explained in about 20 pages. This, as you can imagine, is terribly inadequate. To make things worse, in these 20 pages, many of the characters behave in ways that don't really fit with their... well, character. Most of the scenes in this section of the book feel forced and cramped.<br /><br />Overall, I rate A Memory of Light with eight nine out of ten stars. As the conclusion of the Wheel of Time series, however, it is rated ten out of ten. (No sequel book is ever as good as the first, unless the first was written with it in mind - with loose ends that meet up extraordinarily well in the sequel. You can tell that this ending has been planned for a long time - it wasn't just made up at the last second.)
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|interesting as usual for preston. finishes the story of penderrgast's wife. well worth the effort to read it. wpould recommended the book.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|A friend needed this for a last minute gift for her granddaughter.  I ordered it for her.  Arrived on time with 4 days to spare for Christmas.  She has already watched it several times--plays perfectly.
B00A757EFW|1.0|To say I hate this game, is an understatement.  I love the original arcade game, but the play it on the kindle fire is maddening.  It is very difficult to navigate.  I never even made it through the first screen.  So happy that I didn't pay for it.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip Phillips is one of those artists that can please anyone who enjoys great soulful music. He is a cross between Dave Matthews and Mumford and sons. Would definetly recommend this album!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was surprised how much I love this game.  It's really hard to put down.  I don't know if it's the strategy required or what, but I can't stop playing it.
B003KGBISY|5.0|Great quality on the video and the audio front.  The packaging was a bit messed up and broke. But I'm assuming that happened on the mail.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game play all the time kids love it too like unlocking all the levels gives you something to play for
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm not normally a game player when it comes to ipods and phones.  The screen is usually too small for me to see it and I get bored flipping a bird over and over again.  This game is so fun.  My kids had actually downloaded it to my phone and played it one day when I was bored.  I've been hooked ever since.  This is a great game
B0034JV5Y4|4.0|it might be helpful to refer to a grading table like they have at discogs to ensure you're setting proper expectations with buyer about conditions. the record itself was graded properly however the sleeve was a bit more worn on the edges than i would have liked. not a bad deal overall considering the price. overall good...
B003JTHXOK|4.0|pleasant reading but predictable-I could almost predict every page before I read it but still enjoyed it -I would recommend
B000W93CHC|5.0|Using so many characters, Follet gives a great overall perspective on life in the Middle Ages.  Wonderful attention to detail, which deepens the experience.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Helps me to stay on top of my battery without over charging. I burnt out one charger outlet on a previous kindle and am hoping to avoid doing that again. Like the visual.
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|I got mine today and was pleasantly surprised. AK74 MAGS DO FIT! I wasn't sure if they would. AR mags obviously fit and AK47 mags do not! Also, I am a big man - 6'4\\" 250lbs and the thing could fit a bigger man than me. very comfortable with 6 loaded rifle mags and pistol mags as well as other stuff. (dump pouch, large folder, flashlight) The shoulder straps are well padded and support the weight well. Well worth the money and recommended for a minute man kit.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This is the best book!!! I'm reading the next 12 books!! I recommend it to everyone in the world k
B002RI9K5Y|5.0|I decided to read East of Eden after seeing a 1950's film promo with James Dean.  Steinbeck is like the Shakespeare of the of the Wild West.<br />I have rarely read scuh an insightful or poetic ananlysis of the human condition and all in the colloquial language of early settlement.<br />It is hard to put down and extremely thought provoking. I would recomend it to readers with some depth of life experinece as it takes a very entertaining if intense look at the good and evil in our nature and nurture.
B000002U9L|5.0|I bought this soundtrack along with 3 other Labyrinth memorabilia items for my girlfriend for Christmas 2012. She LOVES the Labyrinth and David Bowie so this was a perfect gift for her. Shipping was a little slow, but still arrived a day before the final estimated delivery date and before Christmas (thank goodness!) a definite gem in any Labyrinth OR Bowie collection! A+ Recommend!

B009329ZF2|4.0|the story was odd, the relationship to the game, unique but a small part of the plot or i would have stopped watching, the aliens and the story one of the better i have seen and most believable i enjoyed it a lot
B00A757EFW|1.0|We played this game when it first came out.  On the small screen I have not figured out how to maneuver him yet.

B004Y042N8|4.0|fun, challenging, colorful; and I like the fact that it can be for all ages.  helps keep the mind sharp.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This a great book. I thought that this was the last book but it turns out that this is the third book
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter had it on her phone,and I liked it. I would like to be able to clear the different levels in order to let someone else play the game from the beginning. I like it because it is a fast game with out needing alot instructions.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really think that the author who wrote this series is very talented. I would definitely recommend this series to my friends and family.
B00633W614|5.0|Have never read Jeffrey Archer before and started with Only Time Will Tell. As soon as I finished it I downloaded Sins of the Father and was not disappointed.  Just as good as the first.  Now I look forard to the third in this series.  I love books that continue a saga about families and Mr. Archer does a masterful job of weaving these peoples stories.
B001I8A76A|5.0|A great performer with an honest and extraordinary voice. I really enjoy the effort she put into making this album fun.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|a little too brilliant for the *average* TV show audience, perhaps... Fringe turns out to actually be a love story, but not the kind you'd presuppose from watching a few episodes. Sure, the relationships between the primary cast result in the kind of *love stories* that usually make for good TV (and good ratings) but the eventual conclusion becomes...<br /><br />(SPOILER? ALERT)<br /><br />Love is the greatest power of all; transcending inter-dimensional physics, time-space continuity, and all other obstacles.<br />IF you suspend disbelief long enough to be drawn in to the myriad sub-plot twists, and follow along through 5 mostly brilliant seasons, you'll see why this series was just above the *average* attention span, but extremely worthwhile if allowed enough time. It's worth watching from the pilot/season 1 forward - continuity throughout the series builds on details & clues given (Fringe's *mythology*.) Kudos to the actors who developed those characters so tenderly & powerfully; and to the writing/production teams who treated every scene as if it were the key scene in a hit feature film franchise, and pulled so many details & connections back together to resolve the somewhat abbreviated final season. Bravo!<br /><br />Buying the 'Complete Season' DVDs turned out to be the best strategy for us - we have otherwise \\"killed\\" our TV and rely now on internet-sourced info/news, & DVDs or downloads. The special features help too. Can hardly wait to re-watch the whole series each time I finish Season 5!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This has to be my all time favorite book. The movie ruined the book. Many people never read the book because of the movie rendition which only covered the last part and did not cover it correctly. I recommend it highly as the best book you will ever read.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Not quite up to season 1, but still great television. If only the aristocracy had really been like this. If only life was so cooperative.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain delves into a world which is not understood by many. It is the world of quiet, introverted people who can be extroverted and funny and charming only if they want to be and are truly passionate about their calling. For years I knew I was very different from most of the people on earth (especially the U.S. extroverted society) and I couldn't figure out why until I read Susan's book QUIET.  It is powerful reading and I couldn't put it down. This is a must read for anyone who is introverted, for extroverted people who want to understand us and for parents who have quiet, highly sensitive kids. Understanding one another and other people is the way to move forward and Susan has done a remarkable job by putting a face to the quiet people who love time alone and time to reflect in this crazy, non-stop, run around world that often drives me a bit crazy.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|love this book as well as the play. A classic everyone should have on their shelf. Very good book. :o)
B00992CF6W|4.0|the kids just love playing minecraft. hour and hours of fun.it was only 6.99 and we'll worth it. if someone else had a kindle you play it with each other so the kids tell me. we will have to check it out.
0316044695|1.0|It's too bad the author was more interested in perpetrating stereotypical political bashing than in telling what appeared to be an amazing military story at the core. I'd prefer to give this book a &#34;zero&#34; rating if it were possible, as the author represents exactly what he incessantly complains about: lack of introspection, towing a specific media POV without accountability or facts, and ultimately superimposing complete blame on a political belief system opposite his own for difficult battle-field decisions gone wrong. The ultimate irony is that the author perfectly exemplifies his own fearful rants on the &#34;brainwashing&#34; of the media. Definitely pass on this one unless you prefer a disturbingly aggressive and unthoughtful view of history - highly recommend &#34;The Heart and The Fist&#34; as a far superior take on the Navy Seals and the war in Afghanistan.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Just finished Gone Girl and was so disappointed in the ending that I would never recommend this book.  Nick is an idiot!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Seen the Wire. Seen Sopranos, Breaking Bad, etc. etc. They are fantastic shows without doubt. But I truly believe the Shield to surpass them all. Incredible characters. Incredible story lines. The individual shows will leave you numb, disturbed (at times), and completely engaged and engrossed. You absolutely can't go wrong here. A phenomenal piece of work.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I use this on my phone and my kindle almost every day. this lots of fun. I understand the need for ads but does 8 out of 10 of them have to be about finding other singles to date?
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A really good book and it gives the reader a real feel for its subject and how he went on to be both creative and difficult in life..a must read...
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is one of my all- time favorite holiday movies. I'm very pleased with how much I paid for the dvd and how fast it was shipped to my address. It was cheaper that Walmart and Best Buy which is where I usually purchase my movies.  I love Amazon.com. I'm always able to find what I want at a reasonable price.
B003UBTX72|4.0|I enjoyed this well written book giving one a real feel for the ups and downs of stardom and the struggles with drugs and finding peace within oneself...I recommend it..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the qualtity is pretty sucky and most of the games are fun i do reccmond it if you like a challenge thats free also would be good for little kids
B001ANYDAO|3.0|I would recommend this book for readers not familiar with current social science research...it may be boring at times for the average reader..
B00280LYIC|5.0|The book was amazing every one should read I. Once u start reading u don't want to stop. That's how good it was.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I found this book to be female oriented and it provided some glimaces of how the author developed her craft but it was not a deeply personal book...it is a quick read..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've always been a fanatic when it comes to reading. Anything involving war or violence has drawn me in. I've always avoided love books because to me they weren't \\"manly\\" enough... until I read this. This book completely changed my view on life.
B008A36R2Y|5.0|Each Arduino has its own unique set of features while maintaining the compatibility that defines the Arduino standard.  Leonardo's strong suit, for me, is its ability to communicate with two serial IOs at the same time for a couple of bucks more than the workhorse UNO.  This saves a lot of time when talking to the Arduino thru the USB port and the Arduino talking to another serial device (e.g., a XBee radio) at the same time.  No more plugging and unplugging USB cables every time you want to change a line of code.  WOW!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great Disney Movie without any distracting political statements (other than maybe non-millitant feminism, but not really the point of the story)
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I find no faults with this wonderful story of Jackson, Mississippi in the sixties.  All the performances are superb.  It is truly a classic.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Lego and minecraft? A combination dream come true! I was very surprised that they came out with this set. I hope they come out with more in the future!
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Salmon fishing in Yemen?  Sounds implausible.  The movie was a true delight.<br />Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor were absolutely wonderful.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very suspenseful and interesting series.didn't know if I would like it at first but then it got very interesting. Not all about sex like e everyone talked but a very emotional love story. I loved it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|An interesting storyline for each character, great acting, incredible backdrops, and wonderful dialogue make this one of best movies I've seen lately.
B004P1JDJO|2.0|Very boring .The book never gets to the point  and just drags on .Chose a different book you will be better off.
B007L6VR12|4.0|I really liked this offbeat movie until the very end.  I thought the ending was confusing.  Bruce Willis really nails the performance.
B000002QWD|5.0|What's Christmas without Bing. Crooner yes, but listen to the phrasing. The cat is a jazzer. you can hear it. That's why, often immulated, never duplicated.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|As with all Maeve Binchy books, the characters draw you in and it's often hard to put the kindle down!  My only complaint, is that it was too short ... I also liked how she wove characters from other MB books into the story.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|My kids love this movie, especially my 4 year old.  She watches clips of it on YouTube and gets to watch the full movie in the car. The only complaint I have is when carol Burnett sings \\"do you want to smoochie my little coochie\\"...not sure if my kids have caught on to that yet, but other than that, I am pleased.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Liked the book.  Well written but certainly gave you an anxious feeling.  Would definitely recommend it though.  Hard to put down book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It brings a needed awareness to a few of the struggles facing the individuals and families with cancer by focusing on life and not of the disease itself.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The author did a good job of buliding complex characters and a layered world. Memorable story that leaves room for a sequel.
1419705849|5.0|My 11yo son loves the book series.  He's read them all.  He has them in soft cover and hard back.
B00002N9ER|5.0|We gave engraved Mag lite flashlights for Christmas gifts. These brackets made them a hit. They are sturdy and can be used in multiple places even on a ATV.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Author Juliet Ashton is thinking of writing her next book on life - such as it could have flourished at all - under the Nazi's on occupied Guernsey.<br />In her researches an exchange of letters introduces us to members of the delightfully quaint Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Literary Society book club whose members can to an extent have a medium through which they can exorcise the trauma as well as the comradeship they experienced under the sometimes heartless treatment that had been meted out to them under their mentors.<br />I found the style of delivery via letters, granted that it is 'over-the-post' often slips into being more like 'over-the-garden-fence' or gossipy in places though the contrast between the light banter and the darker background of degradation and cruelty is well balanced.<br />The almost statutory inclusion of 'woman falling in love with occupying soldier' was a bit clich&eacute; but I so like the quaint, ultimately ideal title and the individual wit.
B006LSZECO|5.0|SLOW START BUT AND AS THE READING WENT ON TO A GREAT SURPRISE END? I ALMOST PUT IT DOWN BUT ONCE IN IT, I COULD NOT STOP READING IT
B004GXZ69W|5.0|What can I say I love Evoluent and their vertical mice.  I have used their vertical mice for about 7 years and love them. I have carpel tunnel syndrome and managed to avoid surgery thanks to Evoluent.  i recommend their products especially their vertical mouse without reservation.  Go to their website [...] and print the handsize chart they have to make sure you get the right size. I used the full size on for years and just got this small version which is slightly smaller but fits most hands.  Its so well designed and comfortable. I simply love it.  Please read the information on their site about how it works.  It also has MAC drivers.  The quality is outstanding and will stand up to years of use.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I LOVE ALL HER BOOKS BUT THIS WAS EXCEPTIONAL.I AM HER BIGGEST FAN AND SHE HASN'T FAILED ME YET. YIPPEE I NEED MORE?
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is perfect for organizing my class notes and using them across multiple platforms seamlessly. I couldn't ask for a better app for this purpose.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|again A GREAT BOOK.  STORY THAT BRINGS OTHERS TO SHAME BUT IT IS COMPELLING AND WORTH READING AS ALL HER BOOKS ARE?
0425220931|5.0|This one really struck a chord, haha with my boyfriend since he is a muscian. I also hope to read when hes done, was a great copy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story is brilliant, witty, insightful and heart-wrenching all at the same time. I really did laugh out loud and cry my guts out. I fell in love with the characters and all the different threads of the story were meticulously woven together into a whole - it's perfection, really. And it was hopeful without resorting to cliche - actually, while laughing in the face of cliche. The only readers who I can see not liking this are those who strongly dislike philosophy. Elements of it reminded me a little bit of the book 'Sophie's World'.... but it was much, much more enjoyable overall. A must read!
B0089OBLDO|5.0|It work's perfectly.  Now I can use my favorite hardwired XBOX360 controller on my PS3.  Just flip a couple switches on the box; it has a switch matrix in the documentation (also on the packaging) plug into gaming console and plug controller into it.  That's all there is to it.
0393312836|4.0|Author has played so much with the language, it is really a unique piece of writing. It is a must read for all lovers of english literature.
B007SUW24W|5.0|This album really struck my interest because Ed Sheeran is a red headed Brit who can sing AND rap. His music is more than just meaningless lyrics and catchy beat, his music has feeling and soul. You can tell all of the lyrics are original and from the heart. Not only are his lyrics original, but he also makes all of his beats and plays the entire guitar backing himself. Sheeran is a completely original artist, and his music is the best I've heard from this generation.<br />Sheeran's song You Need Me, I Don't Need You is a prime example that not all rap has to be about drugs, sex, or money. His raps are solely about his life and performing. He sings about how all of his songs are his own and he doesn't need an agent telling him how to sing or play his own creations. Another of his songs, Wake Me Up, is an abstract love song. He sings about his intricate relationship and all the little things that come along with it. The lyrics of this song show how much he cares about this girl, saying \\"I could do without a tan, on my left hand, where my forefinger meets my knuckle\\" and \\"I know you love Shrek, because we've watched it twelve times.\\"<br />Songs of Sheeran's like Small Bump and The A Team talk about a woman who loses her baby in a miscarriage and a teenage girl who gets caught up in the addictive world of drugs and prostitution. The way he describes these things in his songs make it seem like he has known people personally that have gone through these things. He's very considerate and sings about them with the most sensitive lyrics.<br />I believe Sheeran will be a legend for the meaningful and original lyrics he has put into the music industry at such a time when lyrics aren't normally valued for their content.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I played this game and liked it a lot. It is very addictive, because you play games and unlock new ones at the same time!! Very fun and has many types of games!!
B000FBJAOG|3.0|moderately entertaining.  Seems to be an overall disaster prepardness program.  Zombies or a commentary on society in general.  Good Points.
B008476HBM|4.0|Pride and prejudice is a moving rmance story depicting well the class societ of England and how in the end love prevails over class restraints; pride and individual prejudices.  This book causes deep introspection of one's values; beliefs and mores.
B008F9E306|1.0|I don't think I am going to be listening to it again after my first listen of the whole CD. There seemed to be no redeeming value to the lyrics. The lyrics did not seem to add any value to the listener. I want more thoughtful music.
030758836X|4.0|Typically, I shy away from books that have gotten a lot of press and recognition within popular culture. Combine that with some of the early reviews/summaries that I came across (a marriage in trouble, but it's not what you think!), and I had pretty much erased &#34;Gone Girl&#34; from my radar. Then, lo and behold, Amazon Prime was practically GIVING it away ($3, shipped, for a hardcover?), so I decided to give it a chance. I am pretty much spoiled by my kindle now (lazy as I am), and reading a hard cover book can be tedious, so I wondered if this one would become a dust-catcher on my bedside table. But this book surprised me before I even started reading: its heft is well-balanced, its layout is easy to follow, and there is no &#34;deckle edge&#34; (I hate deckle edge!).<br /><br />Sorry for the anatomy report, but it makes a difference to my reading experience!<br /><br />The story itself is pretty much what those early summaries and reviews promised: husband and wife tell the tale in alternating chapters, from their own point of view at the time. Early on, the wife is found to be missing, and the husband admits to (the reader) lying to the police. Of course, all is not as it might first seem, and the plot twists and turns, revealing, layer upon layer, the truth of this troubled marriage. A likely story, you say? Flynn saves the plot from mediocrity with her pointed, easy-to-read prose and believable portrayal of madmen (and madwomen) on the loose. I couldn't give it five stars, although I really wanted to: the ending, to me, seemed like it stopped short, and cheapened all the work that Flynn had done early on to create this remarkable (still) story.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Really awesome series could watch it and watch it again until my tv or blu ray get on fire !!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Can't wait for book three, quick read, very detailed, love it. Can't decide if I like 50  shades better or these until finish last book, but so far these are better
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|By far the most interesting book I have ever read. I couldn't put it down! Read it in three days. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!  ;D
B00004XPPC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie years ago and after ordering and watching it I remember the reason.  The movie brought out both sides of the conflict.
B0027VTMAE|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Johnny Depp is at the top of his game in this movie. If you are a Depp fan you won't be disappointed.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I liked the first and this one continued on.  Jet Li will probably not be in the next one.  Looking forward to #3.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Very interesting especially coming from a scientist's point of view. Fast read. Thought provoking and inspiring.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|A new twist the the rise of Barnabus.  Hopefully they will make another one and take it further in his mysteries of being a vampire.
B00004X01U|4.0|The title track perfectly summarizes how important and loved music is.<br /><br />'Don't Tell Me' like 'I Deserve It' is a real Country song with acoustic guitar playing thoughout.<br /><br />'What it Feels Like for a Girl' speaks directly to guys who wants to better understand the opposite sex. (Plus those who don't.)<br /><br />'Impressive Instant' is a funny and unique Techno song about music and love.<br /><br />'Runaway Lover'is a fast pace song with the fusion of Techno and Dance.<br /><br />'I Deserve it' is a beautiful love ballad on acoustic guitar; with real Country flare.<br /><br />'Amazing' and 'Nobody's Perfect' both speak about relationships going sour and have yet another fusion of two gerne of music; this time being Techno and Country.<br /><br />'Paradise (Not for Me)' is a very emotional song with Techno playing throughout.<br /><br />'Gone' closes with the acoustic guitar and sends a important message on moving on.<br /><br />This album is a lot of acoustic guitar playing and shows how Madge REALLY is into almost every single kind of music genre out there.<br /><br />Another smash from her yet again.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Knowledge, this book is a good read as long as one understand s it is not a formula for creating or breaking habits. Whether it break s down the science of a habit. However once you understand the science the what, why, and how you are better equipped to make changes.
B000002LCD|4.0|The title track is flirtatious and has a Latin flare as Madge sings to the guy she seduces.<br /><br />'Causing a Commotion' is fun and full of bongo drums playing throughout.<br /><br />'Look of Love, The' like the title track is beautiful and has a foreign flare with the bongo drums and other foreign instrumental in-fused.<br /><br />'Can't Stop' is lovely and plays well with the chemistry between Madonna and Griffin's characters in the movie.<br /><br />'24 Hours' 'Step By Step', 'Turn it Up', 'Best Thing Ever', and 'EL Coco Loco (So So Bad)' aren't bad abd have a bit of famous bands influence in those songs performed by the follows acts on the soundtrack (example: '24 Hours by Duran Faure has the Beatles sound and style).<br /><br />Overall, the soundtrack album is likeable and plays well with the movie starring the singer who also sings on its album.

B0013TPVGK|4.0|A fresh perspective about music and life.  Gets to the important factors of music that are often forgotten or never taught like listening and 'playing the rests.'  This book is not just for bass players either (although I will say, I appreciate the bass even more than I did before and specifically listen for what the bass is doing in whatever song I hear).
B000002NAK|5.0|Operatic music is Andrew Llyodd Webber's trademark and shows in 'Evita', 'Phantom of the Opera, The' ands 'Cats'. Andrew'smusic REALLY ia amaing and brings the best out of those who never thought they even HAD a near Operatic voice (like Madonna).<br /><br />All the songs off the 'Evita' soundtrack are funny, emotional, and tour-de-force.<br /><br />The fusion of Opera with Latin, RocknRoll, and Alternatif music is spot-on.<br /><br />Madonna' voice REALLY is lovely on this album [which includes her idividual songs 'You Must Love Me' and 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' along with the others she sings with Antonio and Jonathan] It shows that she had an amazing voice after all.<br /><br />Antonio and Jonathan both have lovely singing voices and show that they aren't just talented actors (especially Antonio).<br /><br />Overall, the soundtrack is stellar and enjoyable to listen to.<br />I promise you, you won't be disappointed.

B00005AREQ|3.0|I started hearing about this album as a kid.I never got too excited about an album of instrumentals. What does a kid know about songs with no singing? Not much! As a 50 something adult I thought I would give it a try. With that said,here's my review. The guitar playing on this record is great as you would expect, but the songs are way too weak to support the guitar fireworks. The sound quality is okay,sounds a little flat to me to be digitally remastered.An average record.

B005LAII80|5.0|Before you even start reading my review, if you haven't seen DREDD, stop reading and just get it. It's fantastic.<br /><br />Peter Travis and Alex Garland have delivered one of the best action films in recent memory. Karl Urban, clearly a Dredd enthusiast, utterly nailed the hard boiled, unforgiving ballistics of the titular role while Olivia Thirlby's performance will help secure her a place in the next generation of leading talent. She's wonderful as Judge Anderson.<br /><br />The production design and the mature approach to the material singly places DREDD well above the tongue-in-cheek offerings of the Fast and Furious films along with the myriad hyper-realistic productions due later this year. DREDD completely immerses the viewer in the dystopian world of the future and the plight of its citizens. DREDD is exciting, unexpected and, amid the hail of gunfire and Judge Dredd's unmitigated obsession to protect the people, it somehow remains a story of human innocence and empowerment.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this clock, got it so I wouldn't have to use my regular alarm clock or my phone.  It is loud, bright and very useful!
B008MWBY6W|4.0|The AmazonBasics line of products has always represented, in my mind, a basic design, no frills, and a low price that resulted in very high value. This camera case continues that legacy perfectly. It's not the best I could imagine for a holster-style camera case, but it's far from low-end in features and build quality.<br /><br />First, the positive attributes, and then I'll cover some things, if done, would push this case over the top.<br /><br />Build quality is very good. It feels sturdy and well-cushioned. The clips seem durable and not likely to break. The zippers moved easily and the bottom is made of a plastic or vinyl material that seems like it would protect against casual wetness and it's hard enough to keep the case upright with a camera inside. There is a top handle and a shoulder strap; making it easy enough to move and carry.<br /><br />Padding is well-done throughout. I do not feel as though any normal amount of use that a camera bag endures would cause a problem for a camera protected in this case. The adjustable velcro straps allow you to have the camera straddled between them so that the lens does not touch the bottom of the case. They are infinitely adjustable throughout the vertical dimension of the case's interior, so it should fit a variety of lens lengths up to a certain maximum (I'll come back to this later).<br /><br />The extra pockets are suitable, but not sizeable. You are probably not going to be able to fit all of your camera's accessories at once in this bag, but I think it would suit the needs for a day trip just fine. An extra battery, the charger, and a few lens filters can join the memory cards that can be placed in the provided pockets just fine. You will not, however, likely have room for more lenses than the one on the camera.<br /><br />When I requested this item, there were no details available about its size, so I had no reasonable expectations beyond that it would be suitable for a DSLR. It fits a Nikon D5100 with the kit 18-55mm lens easily, with a couple inches of length to spare when the camera is held as close to the top cover as possible. It comes very close to fitting with the 55-300mm zoom lens, but not quite. It's a very tight fit; too tight for comfort. The lens cover is resting on the bottom of the case, and my feeling is that the lens cover should not be touching so that any shock to the bottom of the case is not transferred to the lens or the camera mount and body.<br /><br />The velcro straps that support the camera body inside the case do a decent enough job, but I couldn't help but wish for cushioned side pockets in the interior instead so that the lens was resting against something instead of being allowed to swing free. It's probably not a problem in the grand scheme of things, but some more substantial padded side pieces like what are in some Lowepro cases would be very welcome.<br /><br />One additional wish would be to have something that would keep the top flap in check when it was unzipped. After removing the camera to take some shots, it would be nice to have some way for the flap to stay close to the case without having to rezip it. Maybe a small magnet in the cover and the case to hold it together? It's a very minor thing and its absence does not detract from my impressions of this product.<br /><br />This case stays true to the AmazonBasics product line. It's available at an excellent price, it doesn't skimp on build quality, but it does lack the niceties of cases that are three times its cost. Many people will have no problem making that trade-off. This is not as nice as a Lowepro case, but it doesn't cost as much as a Lowepro case either. It is however a very good value and worth every one of the four stars that I've awarded it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Definitely predictable but good music and lots of smiles and fun.  It made my flight much more relaxing and fun.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Nice solid cast, though I think Clive Owen owns this film.  Not the usual bank caper I was expecting, lots of subtle little twists and surprises to keep this a very interesting movie.  Well worth watching with a big bowl of popcorn.

0920668372|5.0|I believe that this children's book is one of the best and maybe even the best. My wife and I read this book many many times to our children when they were young and I recently purchased this book for my niece and nephew to read to their kids. Needless to say they love this book also. Please consider purchasing this book and reading it to your kids. You will love it also.
8866130931|2.0|I have used Molesking in the past and loved it, however this edition left me wanting more.  First, there used to be a place specifically for contact numbers, now just some blank note pages in the back.  Also the book does not lay flat for easy writing and each week page does not show the month at a glance, forcing you to turn to a different page to see the whole month.  Very cumbersome to use.  Found one at Target and TJ Maxx that was better for half the cost.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|i bought the Harry Potter collection and the only thing i didn't have was the deathly Hallows 1 and 2.  when i was able to I bought part 1 first.  Of course after that every Harry potter movie were expensive!  Blah so I waited a while to get part 2.  I don't have blue ray so i didn't need a combo set of anything.  while i was looking around in amazon i found the were selling Harry Potter and the deathly hallows part 2 . Yay.. and when i saw the price i was like even more &#34;Yay!&#34; lol all walk in stores were selling it at the time for  $16 and above.  i now have this wonder movie to complete my collection for an awesome price.  have a great day

B004EPYZU8|4.0|I hade to have this movie in my collection.  made my order on Saturday and it came in 4 days later.  Dvd in great condition.  I first saw this movie in theaters and i was blow away.  the story and action screen were awesome.  at first you made get lost but at the end of the movie everything will come together and make sense.  I must admit.. i cried at the end of the movie.  It nice to have something different once in a while.
B001P3SA94|3.0|I love Chess records.  As so many have said, Chess along with Sun and Atlantic constitute the Holy Trinity of independent labels, and I've been a devotee of Mud, Wolf, Sonny Boy, Walter, and Jimmy since I was a teenager.  I know their music backwards and forwards, and, thanks to the YouTube age, I've seen loads of interviews and performances featuring these legends.<br /><br />That's why I can say this film is extremely entertaining, recreates the music very well, and might be a good intro to this part of the musical world for the uninitiated, but if you want to know anything about Chess records other than the fact that it was based in Chicago and featured the aforementioned artists, go read a book.  This film is a tall tale, a slightly more realistic version of what \\"I'm Not There\\" was for Bob Dylan.<br /><br />I'm not going to spend time repeating the same complaints: the conspicuous absence of Phil Chess, the semi-whitewashing of Chess's handling of royalties, the blatant fictional affair between Leonard Chess and Etta James, the exaggerated issues with James's father, etc.  Instead, I'd like to talk about what most critics and reviewers laud: the performances.  Jeffrey Wright and Beyonce Knowles do FANTASTICALLY as characters who happen to be named Muddy Waters and Etta James, but not as recreations of the historical Muddy Waters and Etta James.  I mean, since when did Muddy Waters mumble?  I've seen I don't know how many interviews with him, and he spoke clearly and articulately; he didn't grunt monosyllabically.  As for Beyonce, I was pleasantly surprised by her performance, considering the terrible ones she's turned out in the past (\\"Goldmember,\\" anyone?), but still, she's not Etta James.  She did the songs beautifully, but she did them as Beyonce.  If a newbie to the world of music like Joaquin Phoenix can approximate Johnny Cash so well, I would have expected a veteran singer like Beyonce to pull off an uncanny impersonation.  Perhaps her ego got in the way: after all, she doesn't sell records by being an Etta James impersonator, and if a song is going on a major soundtrack, I'm sure she wants it to be a Beyonce song through and through.<br /><br />One major gripe I had with this movie is the age issues: I mean, the events in this movie cover about 26 years (from 1941 till 1967), yet NOBODY SEEMS TO AGE.  Muddy looks a bit older shortly after he arrives in Chicago and grows his moustache and pompadour, but then time seems to stand still for him, and Phil Chess apparently doesn't age a day, which makes it hard to believe he had a heart attack.  Also, when Alan Lomax came to record Muddy Waters in 1941 in the early '40s he was not yet 30 years old--2 years younger than Muddy himself--yet in the film he looks almost 50.  This might seem like nitpicking, but I think things like this are laziness on Hollywood's part, which is becoming endemic these days.<br /><br />This is not a poorly made film.  I'm usually quite critical of biopics because I think this genre is being done to death these days, but I have to say this film does avoid a lot of the cliches.  I'm not against fictionalization per se; I agree that if a film told a story straight, it would be boring and confusing.  However, I think there's a limit.  In the end, it just all depends on what you want.  If you want a film about fictional characters that slightly resemble historical personalities with excellent music, you will probably enjoy it.  If, however, like me the Chess catalogue means a lot to you, you might find a lot in this movie to irritate you.

B0087ZG7HK|5.0|If memory serves, despite the great technological advances in the 60 Years between King Kong and Jurassic Park, the Great Ape still has the edge over the Dinosaurs. The difference fundamentally is, of course, that the Great Ape had a heart and a soul: he could and did love the White Goddess, Fay Wray. There is no love between these monsters and humans (although some possibilities occur-unexplored by any but the merest gesture-are adumbrated that there is some evolutionary possibility of love emerging between the non-carnivore leaf eaters (pre-giraffe) and our representatives.<br />Happily, one can see and enjoy both today and anyone seeking adventurous thrills in a film should see both. This is one of the films one should see not only for the entertainment thrills but to share in one of the pioneer movies in the movement toward animation which today has almost displaced the human actor and tomorrow....well, who knows. The human actors are limited by the scriptwriters to stereotyped responses but do an acceptable job within those narrow confines. Richard Attenborough, Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum handle the co-starred roles as well as they are allowed; Josh Mostel is the fat-man villain who earns his comeuppance as a just penalty for his vile nastiness. Above all, the creatures are the focus and do a bang-up job thereby earning the reward of making the two additional films their performances allowed. The two kids were suitably terrified and, hopefully, will suffer no lasting harm from their exposure to the Hollywood spotlight.<br />Need I add that Spielberg can be proud of his achievement, as well as being happy over the fortune he earned from it.<br />If you have not done so, you will want to see this picture; if you have seen it, as did I, the second time can be even better than the first.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I really enjoyed Clint Eastwood in this movie. Everything he touches is gold in my opinion.  I enjoyed the characters interactions and am so happy we purchased it, I will watch it over and over again'

B00AYDC5HY|4.0|What a fun film. I rented it for giggles and bought it because I enjoyed it so much. You find your self laughing out loud at the characters and then getting so involved with the characters that you forget how silly some of it is. It is endearing. You will cheer the youg franken dog. The movie will not finish without leaving you feeling good about it and humanity. Well done.
