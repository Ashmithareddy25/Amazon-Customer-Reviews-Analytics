B00005JMAH|4.0|I enjoyed this film very much and I think that the Harry Potter community needed a dose of fresh directing from the very talented Alfonso Cuaron. He really tried to capture the teenage angst and add his own flare to the Potterverse.  But, as with all fims, there are always going to be some disappointments; <br />problem number one was that the film  was too short (shorter than the first two films when the 3rd book is longer than the previous 2) and too much story was left out.  What made the book great was all of Rowling's little details and the film just lacked those details.  Also, the scenes at Hogwarts were way too rushed to try to get the viewers to the final climax.  On the plus side, the children actors gave their best performance to date, although I seriously think that WB should recast Harry.  Daniel Radcliffe just doesn't bring the character to life and I honestly thought his crying scene was plainly horrible acting.  But, Emma Watson, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, and Gary Oldman all gave a brilliant perfomances!  The special effects were amazing, and Buckbeak was a real achievement.  Overall, this film has it's flaws, but is was still very enjoyable and I look forward to the next installment.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am a diehard U2 fan and I was worried when I first listened to this album because I liked it after one listen.  This had never happened before.  I actually despised Achtung Baby! and The Joshua Tree after one listen, but now I love those albums.  I have now listened to HTDAAB five times through and I like it more after every listen.  I urge those of you who dislike this album after one listen to give the album two or three more spins before deciding how much you like it!  U2's music is so complex and multi-layered that it takes several listens to decipher a melody to latch onto.
B00008AWOD|4.0|Strangely enough most Goths you talk to deny the fact that they are indeed Goths. The Gothier they are the more vehemently they will deny their Gothness. Are they so Goth they are not really Goths anymore? Or do you need to actually piss black eyeliner to be a real Goth.. It's all too much for my inferior non Goth mind to ponder. But ask the same people formerly assumed to be Goths about music and they will deny that almost any given artist produces Goth music.. So it is with Placebo. <br /> <br />Ok eyeliner abusers anonymous, so they are not Goths. But they do belong in any sexually confused teenagers angst kit. Poppy Z Brite Novel - Check, Anne Rice Novel - Check, Placebo Album - Check. Placebo's latest offering Sleeping with Ghosts offers plenty of the bitchy, sharp, melodramatic, omnisexual brand of pop that has earned them their angstmaster cult following. What it also offers and what may begin to alienate them from their base audience is their increasing maturity. Brian has cut his long black hair and is hardly wearing a skerick of makeup on the album sleeve. His former glam has been swapped for an almost ascetic austerity. While Sleeping with Ghosts has tracks with the energy seen on Black Market Music and Without you I'm Nothing there are also many tracks showing genuine insight and depth. <br /> <br />Sleeping with Ghosts is an album that almost could have been great. There are moments of musical and insightful genius there.. and some of those moments last for entire tracks. Unfortunately between these golden moments there is a lot of trite, boring, self indulgence. It's a hard album to slot into a genre as not only is there plenty of the Brit pop based sound we are used to hearing from placebo there is also an increasing move toward electronica. <br /> <br />The stand out track on the album for me was the slinky, poisonous grind of Something Rotten. There are also some genuinely beguiling moments both lyrically and musically in This Picture and Special Needs. It's hard to say anything really nasty about Sleeping with Ghosts because even the weakest tracks have that sprinkling of genius. But it's just a glimmer. Frustrating! <br />
B00000K31Q|1.0|I was forced to see this movie at school, and believe me, it is not worth watching. The sexual content disgusted me, and the movie was not worth going through all of the gross stuff. I would much rather recomend the 1967 version of \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" with Elizabeth Taylor. I would also reccomend seeing the play, anything rather then watch this horrible movie.
0783229364|4.0|I found it interesting that Roger Ebert disliked this movie.  This movie is not artistic or well-acted.  The situations are ludicrous and unlikely.  However, this movie offers well-executed comedy that is highly entertaining.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox is Brantly Foster, a recent college graduate and the nephew of a business executive and his wife.  Foster is intelligent and considers that perhaps Uncle Howard (Richard Jordan) might give him an opportunity in his company.  A job in the mail room was not exactly the start that Foster had in mind.<br /><br />Foster realizes that in a corporation the size of his uncle's that it is easy to do things without anyone realizing what is happening.  So Foster sets himself up as newly hired executive Carlton Whitfield.  Most of the executives accept Whitfield for what he seems to be.  Foster's only significant problems are keeping Uncle Howard from finding out that he is also Carlton Whitfield and keeping his mail room boss from learning that he is not always delivering mail when he should be.<br /><br />Foster/Whitfield soon encounters beautiful Christy Wills (Helen Slater), a young and highly intelligent executive, with whom he soon falls in love.  Just as quickly he also encounters Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton) and has more than one amorous encounter, before and after finding out she is his aunt by marriage.<br /><br />With Foster impersonating an executive while working in the mail room, courting Christy, who, unbeknownst to him, is also involved with Uncle Howard, and avoiding Aunt Vera as much as possible, the comedic potential is high, and the movie delivers.  Much of the comedy is borderline slapstick, but much of it is also situational.<br /><br />The highlight of this movie, as with many light comedies of the 80s, is the somewhat clich&eacute; happy ending in the face of apparent doom.  While you know there has to be a happy ending somewhere, unless you were very attentive it was easy to miss the clues given that suggest what the ending might be.<br /><br />This movie is one of my favorite 80s comedies.  While some critics have treated it harshly, the movie is fun to watch over and over because the situations, while predictable, are well done.  Michael J. Fox at the peak of his career always brought a likable presence to the screen and his execution usually brings at least smiles and more often laughs.ne of my favorite 80s comedies.

B00068IOWC|1.0|I'm not going to review the album, I'm only going to review this \\"deluxe\\" edition. The DVD appeared here is just filler stuff, like the one appeared on Best Of 1990-2000. The short documentary is boring and goes nowhere. The songs presented \\"live\\" are nothing interesting. Overall, go with standard edition instead.
B0006399FS|3.0|This is another fine offering by U-2. The only thing that keeps it from being great is the inclusion of the I-Pod advertising jingle - VERTIGO. U2 needs to buy a clue about using I-Pod to promote their works. It's going the ruin the song for the public.  Is there anyone out there not absolutely ill of hearing Vertigo. Again, that aside the album rocks!
B0000028MA|5.0|This is a must-have for anyone who appreciates rock in any or all of it's fine stages.  It doesn't have to be about \\"grunge\\" or \\"modern rock\\" or \\"the 90's\\"  It's about great music that forever signifies a moment in time.  For some one like me, who was in High School at the time, it's even more powerful, because this music isn't just the soundtrack for a movie, it's part of the greater soundtrack to my life.  Watch the movie, but more importantly, listen to the songs, and hopefully one or two of them will take you back to a place you haven't thought of in years...that's what it's done for me. <br />
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Overall the movie is good. The Matrix Trilogy had to have some type of ending. No matter how good it was, everyone knew it wasnt going to be as good as the first movie. The first Matrix was better, the 2nd was OK, and the 3rd movie was the 2nd best out of the three.
B0006399FS|1.0|I was excited about a new U2 album.  And this time for good reason.  Steve Lillywhite in the producers chair for some songs and a great lead off single.  Unfortunately, that single is the only good song on the album.  I am a huge U2 fan, and am so dissappointed.  What a waste of time and money.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.  Maybe I should have known after Stuck In A Moment.  Most bands are lucky to have released two or three good albums.  For U2 to have released six or seven is impressive.  But everyone is praising this album just because SL is on it.  A good producer can not make a good album out of mediocre material any more than a good actor can save a bad story line.  Buy the Vertigo single and call it a day!
B000002H70|5.0|The last, eponymous Cure record was sorely disappointing for me, so I went back to this, one of The Cure's two most successful records (along with Wish).    It was once said that The Velvet Underground was the greatest singles band without actual hits, but I think The Cure ranks up there as well.  Here we have the #2 smash \\"Lovesong\\", a haunting, mantric lamentation whose every instrumental part is a hook, with unforgettable keyboard lines and a fragile Robert Smith lead vocal that gets under your skin.  But my favourite has always been the hallucinatory cinemascope soundscape of \\"Fascination Street\\".  I'm going to go out on a limb here and call Simon Gallup one of the all-time great bass players, because on this record, he not only anchors the groove, but creates basslines so maddeningly agile and catchy that they become the main melody of the song.  His interplay with drummer Boris Williams is priceless; it's the thudding groove of \\"Lovesong\\" and that breathtaking bass riff of \\"Fascination Street\\" that are this record's most seductive sounds.  \\"Prayers for Rain\\" is like a piece of towering Gothic architecture, majestic yet terrifying -- I keep picturing the nightmarish city scapes of The Crow.  \\"Pictures of You\\" is languishing and soulful. \\"Lullaby\\" is disturbingly baroque, and \\"Untitled\\" features yet another fantastic Gallup/Williams performance, with its nervous beats and shimmering, contrasting guitars.  Robert Smith's songwriting is godly on this record, without a single misstep, though given performances like these, even weak songs would have been made good.    This is a key '80s record that has proven immensely influential.  Its sonic beauty is unsurpassed; the expansive tracks are just like the first time you heard Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon.  Essential record in anyone's collection.
B000669GAI|4.0|I've been listening to Pearl Jam since the glory days of Ten, been a Ten Club member for about just as long.  I own every album on CD, own every officially release live bootleg, and like many other fans, I own just about every album on vinyl, even all the singles.<br /><br />It's hard to find the \\"perfect\\" mix of more than a decade worth of work from one of the greatest rock bands of the more modern era, but this \\"greatest hits\\" album does a decent job.  For me, it's hard to come to terms with the fact that my favorite band has a greatest hits album, but I guess it shows my age as well.<br /><br />Personally, I would like to see a live greatest hits compilation boxed set released one day for fans like myself.  This album is not a must own for the dedicated Pearl Jam fan, but remember - you will have a slot missing from your collection if you don't pick it up.<br /><br />What this album really is though... it is an excellent gateway for the new generation of Pearl Jam fans.  It captures over a decade worth of memorable Pearl Jam tunes, especially for a new fan.  This is the album a hardcore fan buys his/her sugnificant other or friend to get them into Pearl Jam... this is an album that you give to your kids so they don't listen to the pop rock that is filling their ears these days...<br /><br />More importantly this album marks the end of Pearl Jam's 7 album deal with Sony/Epic.  From this point forward, Pearl Jam is in control of their own destiny and personally, I can't wait to see what the boys come up with next!
B000687M48|5.0|There have been artists in the past couple of years I've liked more than this band -- Kathleen Edwards, for example -- but none of them were as good at presenting themselves visually as this band. <br /> <br />Is it taste?  Good choice in collaborators?  The mystique of the band?  Or all of the above?  Regardless of the reason, this package is an excellent audio-visual representation of the band.  Because there are so many components in this release, I'll have to break them down. <br /> <br />The live CD is very well done, with good performances and mixing.  I own all of the singles from the Fallen album and have always been impressed by the quality of this band's live recordings, and this live CD is no exception.  \\"Breathe No More\\" is especially revelatory, with gorgeously spare acoustic guitar lines, a subdued backbeat and Amy Lee's crystalline voice forming a perfect coalition.  Just mind-blowing.  There are discrepancies in levels from track to track, a minor flaw, so be prepared to adjust your volume levels, and the CD booklet messed up the track listing, which isn't outwardly visible on the package.  Next time, guys, put the track listing on the back of the CD box! <br /> <br />The live CD sounds good, the concert portion of the DVD does not.  The shooting and editing of this live footage is impressive; this looks like the work of somebody who knows how to cut music and performance and conveys the energy of the music and musicians well.  But somebody in the DVD production seems to have botched the sound.  I don't know if it's because of the recording -- judging from the good quality of Evanescence's live audio material, this is highly unlikely, so chances are it happened in post-production.  Not only are the levels far too low, but there seems to be a big space missing somewhere in the mix.  Throughout the DVD concert I felt like as if there's a vacuum somewhere in front of me and to the right.  Perhaps a frequency range under-represented.  In any case, everybody -- Lee, the guitar players, the backbeat -- is low in volume, and get ready to have your ears blasted the minute you hit the menu button to go from the DVD concert to the main menu.  The difference in volume must be at least 6dB.  Such a shame, because if this concert had a sound mix like the live CD here, it would be killer.  Though the band is now inching towards superstar status, there's still a disarming innocence about both the band and its audience, such as when Lee invites the audience to sing along to \\"My Immortal\\".  Her face seems to open up, as if slightly embarrassed by the gesture, but touched by the audience's reception. <br /> <br />The DVD includes all the videos made by the band up to now, and they are some of the most well done I've seen in years.  I've made plain my dislike of modern music videos, but these ones recall the golden era of the form.  With the exception of \\"Bring Me to Life\\" (nice staging, limited concepts), the videos are well tailored to their songs.  Finally, we get video directors who pay attention to the lyrics!  I'd never seen \\"Everybody's Fool\\" before this, and it floored me.  Who said a goth-metal band can't have a sense of humour?  The dark hotel-room nightmare is harrowing -- Lee plays the character as a drug addict in withdrawal.  \\"Going Under\\" is a good, solid performance video, and \\"My Immortal\\" is more about shots than story, but it far surpasses most concept videos today just by virtue of shot variety; this is one video that doesn't look like it was shot in one day, and is emotionally true to the music.  And the image of ex-guitarist Ben Moody alone at the piano, separate from the band, is both affecting -- and revelatory, just like the famous \\"Ian Curtis ghost\\" in New Order's \\"Perfect Kiss\\". <br /> <br />A few points ducked for the horrible sound mix on the concert DVD, but otherwise, this is an extremely satisfying release, made even more so by its modest price.  Overall, thumbs up. <br /> <br />(A final word to certain other reviewers:  You're not supposed to treat live albums like regular releases.  Few live albums contain many new songs.  Know the distinction!)
B0002MPU1K|2.0|Wow....Peter Cincotti's CD to me really fell short of all the press and product placement he's been receiving. He apparently has been deemed \\"the new Harry Connick Jr.\\". Are you kidding? I don't know if this proclamation came from his own publicity folks or not (though I tend to guess that's probably the case), but regardless, it couldn't be any more inaccurate of a description. Cincotti's piano playing is fair - however, his vocals need a lot of work. It's not a bad voice....it just needs lots of work. As it is right now, he sounds more like a decent karaoke singer than a real jazz vocalist. He's young, so hopefully over time he will improve. However in the mean time, the amount of mediocrity flooding the music scene in general continues to be frustrating. Unfortunately, Cincotti's contribution doesn't help matters. One final thought - a nice cover photo does not make a great musician.
B0000TB014|4.0|If you were like me and already owned the two DVDs of HIStory (Video Greatest Hits - HIStory and HIStory on Film - Volume II), you were probably disdainful when this Number Ones DVD got released.  Almost everything on Number Ones was already presented in the HIStory DVDs. <br /> <br />So is there buying incentive?  At bargain-bin prices, yes, because on this DVD you will find three Michael Jackson videos that range from good to fantastic, and they're not available on DVD outside of here. <br /> <br />\\"Man in the Mirror\\" was a flat-out ballsy move on Jackson's part, to use only grainy stock footage and not a single shot of himself to make a video of one of his greatest hits of that time (\\"Man\\" was one of two singles from Bad that had two weeks at #1, not one).  The song itself is a classic, thanks to one of Quincy Jones' best productions, a soul-stirring rhythm track, and Siedah Garrett's poetic, visionary lyrics, but coupled with the video's images of a world in turmoil, it's magic.  This style actually spawned another classic music video years later with Soul Asylum's \\"Runaway Train\\", but Jackson was there first. <br /> <br />\\"Dirty Diana\\" holds a special place for me because it's one of the very few Jackson performance videos.  Many people don't like the song, but I like it just fine, and Jackson and guitarist Steve Stevens were on fire in the stage show.  This video made you realize that Jackson's touring band simply kicked ass. <br /> <br />There's one more curio:  The short, sped-up version of \\"Smooth Criminal\\" intended as a broadcast alternative.  This was the first version of this classic video I ever saw, and while it doesn't convey the stunning choreography and art direction of the full version, it is a masterpiece from the editing standpoint.  If you want to do speed cutting, this is the way to do it, and at many points they even managed to sync up Jackson's hyper-sped-up footage to the tempo of the track, no small feat.  Unfortunately, both this video and\\"Dirty Diana\\" seem to lack for a good master source; both videos feature substantial film scratches and look far less pristine than the rest of the official videos. <br /> <br />There's just one more video on here not available on other DVDs, and that's \\"You Rock My World\\".  The song blows, and so does the video -- an expensive, self-indulgent piece whose only point of interest is its guest stars Chris Tucker, Michael Madsen and Billy Drago (Nitti in The Untouchables).  I'm not surprised this video was directed by Paul Hunter, the same man who had made Bulletproof Monk an unwatchable mess, because \\"You Rock My World\\" is your typical modern video with too much concept and not enough substance -- the choreography is messy, Jackson himself looks ridiculous (as he always does when he tries to act), and all the guest stars are wasted when they could've been given a chances to really colour the video with their personalities.  Even \\"Liberian Girl\\" (available on HIStory on Film Volume II) was better. <br /> <br />I got this DVD from the bargain bin, so from my end, it was still worth it just for the three videos I mentioned.  If you don't own either HIStory DVDs, I'd still recommend you get them rather than Number Ones, because the HIStory DVDs are a more comprehensive collection of Jackson's videos, and it's on those that you'll find the classic full version of \\"Smooth Criminal\\".  Number Ones is for the casual viewer who wants to pay less to get most of Jackson's videos.  If that's your preference, then this DVD will serve just fine.  I'm still waiting for them to put Moonwalker out on DVD, though.  That live version of \\"Come Together\\" and the hilarious \\"Bad\\" spoof \\"Badder\\" (featuring kids playing the punk roles!) are still only available on Moonwalker, and it's about time they resurfaced.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 are one of the few bands in the history of rock which have maintained such a high level of commercial success while still maintaining their musical integrity and basically addding to their absolutely HUGE following as they went along.  <br /> <br />However, I had lost a lot of the love I had for my favorite band of the 80s after the infamous ZooTV tour ended. \\"Pop\\" was too over-the-top experimental for me, and although it was a good album, it had some fillers. It felt rushed and we found out it was. With 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" I found myself cringing at the feeling that u2 were simply running through the motions with a very \\"safe\\" record. Although the first half was maybe one of their strongest, the second half was full of weak attempts to fill an album, the exception being \\"New York.\\"  <br /> <br />To say I was excited to hear \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" might be the biggest understatement of the year. This u2 record, for the first time in years, lives off emotion and is soaked with passion and pure beauty. As a musician, I find myself being sometimes too critical of music I listen to. With U2 this is easy, as you can not possibly get a grip on the true essence of any of their albums without fully falling into the songs and discovering each and every one of them.  <br /> <br />The first half of HTDAAB are stacked with singles and juggernauts. \\"Vertigo\\" blasts through the speakers to lead off the album, the perfect first track as Bono does the Spanish countdown and Edge comes in with the angry guitar riffs. I think \\"Miracle Drug\\" officially has the copyright sign after the G because it is a classic u2 song in which only they can do. Incredible, as is \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own,\\" which is a good companion to \\"Stuck in a Moment.\\" It's honestly a little better though. The hair-raising ballad leads into the experimental \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", which is filled with so many sounds it could have been separated into three different songs. The guitar work by Edge is nothing short of genius, and it covers up pretty weak lyrics by Bono. The next track is the strongest on the record and will be the highlight of next year's tour. \\"The City of Blinding Lights\\" is the song I've been waiting for them to make since the \\"Joshua Tree.\\" It is pure beauty which puts you back in the 80s, and then the next song \\"All Because of You\\" seems to jump you back two decades more. This is definetly influenced by the Stones, as Edge goes crazy with his guitar again. Again, it does an amazing job at covering up a slightly weak chorus. Other than that, a fantastic track.  <br /> <br />Enough of those radio hits, now is when the record gets really interesting. \\"A Man and a Woman\\" is a pretty risky move by U2 because it's basically a love song with some \\"marvin gaye\\" influence sprinkled on it. Sometimes I sit back and think, how do they pull stuff like this off? But they do, and the funny thing is the first time you hear it, you say to yourself it may be the worst song they ever recorded. Five listens later, you know all the words and are singing it at work. \\"Crumbs from You Table\\" I was hearing was the weakest here, but that's very untrue. The song and guitar work, although stellar, do get a little repetitive, but Bono is flawless here and delivers a monster. \\"One Step Closer\\" is the song which is essential to the whole theme of the album, and it just has me in emotional knots when I hear it. It's very touching, and I found it more personal than the following \\"Original of the Species\\", which is a fantastic tune but feels like u2 were trying too hard to make a hit with it. And finally u2's best closer since \\"All I Want is You,\\" it is \\"Yahweh,\\" a fascinating song which runs by you so smoothly like a summer breeze. It has just impeccable lyrics and ends the album with Bono declaring, \\"take this heart...and make it break.\\"  <br /> <br />With the collectors edition comes \\"Fast Cars,\\" a fun track which u2 completed in a fewhours on the final day in the studio. It's truly great, but I'm glad it is not on the regular album format, it doesn't fit the overall theme of the record.  <br /> <br />I've always stayed interested in u2 over the last few years, but I didn't feel that emotion to their music which had connected me to them when I first heard \\"Bad\\" in 1984. This album brings all that back for me and once again displays the band's truly unforgettable fire.
B00005JNDX|1.0|I didn't care much for the first \\"Bridget Jones\\" movie, and the second one was just plain awful.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out what is supposed to be appealing about Renee Zellweger's character.  She's not a BAD person, but she's annoying and is a social disaster, and I don't understand how these two fabulous British guys (played by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant) could possibly be interested in her.<br /><br />The plot of \\"The Edge of Reason\\" also leaves a lot to be desired.  There really wasn't anything else to tell about Bridget Jones, but since the first film made so much money, they decided to make a second movie (regardless of the fact that it was so crappy) in hopes of making even MORE money.  Sadly, the plan worked, but I wasted two hours of my life in the movie theatre that I'll never get back.<br /><br />I really tried to like this movie.  I love Firth and Grant, but they weren't enough to save the film.  (Grant is only in the movie for a grand total of about ten minutes, too, so moviegoers who haven't read the book version will likely be disappointed.)  By the time the Thai prison scenes rolled around, I was thoroughly disgusted.  How could they have made this movie more ridiculous?!  I don't think they could have.<br /><br />The only \\"good\\" thing I can say about this movie is that it supposedly sticks pretty close to the plot of the book, but that should tell you something about the quality of that particular novel.  I haven't read it, but I'm guessing that it sucks.  Don't waste your time or money on this crappy, crappy movie.
B000002LND|5.0|This is the best cd of Madonna that I own. You have all of the Queen of Pop Hits on one cd. Do I need to say more but she mix some of the singles like: Like A Prayer I had to get into it a few times before I like it but it doesn't beat the orginal.
068987474X|2.0|I saw Greg's HBO special.  I was highly amused and I even thought he was kind of cute.  He's a little butt heavy for me but still cute.  I bought this book(my local library doesn't have it) on the advice of a friend.  I sincerely hope she doesn't take this book as seriously as she led me to believe.  It is good for a chuckle but the advice should be taken with a couple of thousand grains of salt-make that a couple of million. <br /> <br />The views are far too simplistic.  It seems that in Greg's world men always know exactly what they want.  If you believe that one I've got a bridge to sell...real cheap. <br /> <br />All men are not Alpha males and most are not the single minded, goal driven, decisive, action oriented creatures that this book would have us believe.  EVERYBODY has baggage and that includes men.  How we cope with this baggage determines the survival or demise of our relationships. This provided we clear the hurdles of mutual attraction. <br /> <br />I personally take issue the the assertions that women are incapable of having purely physical relationship with men.  We don't get emotionally attached to every man we have sex with.  It's nice to care whether he lives or dies-but trust me it's not necessary. <br /> <br />My real bone is the \\"don't go out with a man who doesn't ask you out first\\" commandment.  It takes all of our powers to choose away from us.  The last time I checked all my bills had my name on them.  If I can pay all my own bills, i can damn sure ask a man out for coffee or a drink.  I don't have a submissive personality.  Waiting for him to ask me out won't change that.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of light has to be one of my favorite Madonna cd. I love all the songs on here but my favorite is Little Star. That is one powerful song. You can see how motherhood has change Madonna and for that everyone needs to have this cd in their collection.
B0006399FS|5.0|I think this is a great album.  I have listened to it several times and I enjoy it very much. I have read some of the reviews from supposed \\"Fans\\" that have given this album 1 or 2 stars, I think they are all wrong and obviously not true fans like they say!  This is one of U2's best albums.
B0006399FS|2.0|As much as I am unwilling to write off the greatest rock band on the planet, I can't believe that some people think the latest work could be compared to Joshua Tree. That is laughable!!! In no age or time could this album grab the world and spin it around like Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby did. I read the reviews before I went and bought the CD - nothing could have stopped me from getting this CD anyway. But man, do I wish I had shopped around for the cheapest deal instead of shelling out $17 (with taxes) for some mediocre ballads at best. As much I agree U2 songs are multi-layered and all, this album is so not fluid and seems like they have been working at it to get at something which they did not. Its like when the transmission goes wrong on your car. Well good news is that it ain't anywhere near as horrible as Sting's last effort. Bad news is Coldplay, Five for Fighting, John Mayer beat this album hands down. I believe though that if Bono and the gang goes soul searching in the Amazon or the Himalayas, they will come out with some mind-blowing music - they ain't dead yet!!!
B000069HPL|3.0|I think this movie had a very good story but it lacked comedy.The only funny parts were with the guy that stuttered.But I think the story had a verry good outline but it had no comedy in it.So In conconclusion if you want to laugh go buy american pie.
0765309408|4.0|I read this book when John made an early version available online, and it's excellent. Exciting, thought-provoking, even (as once was said of Paula Zahn) a little bit sexy. A great buy for any sci-fi fan.
B0006399FS|2.0|Dear Friends... <br />U2 has been at the center of my favourite music for over 20 years.  I can not bash a band that has been there for me for so long.  BUT... This record just sounds so safe, so flat, so thin.....OK, I'm going to say it......boring!  The band and I are all older than we used to be.  I too am boring I just wish they could have somehow avoided it!  Everybody makes mistakes & right now I feel this is the biggest mistake record of their career.  See you all in a few years and lets all hope for better next time. <br /> <br />best
B0006399FS|2.0|Dont get me wrong this band is still in good shape, but there's just something missing here. None of the songs really grab my attention, they sound bored. I have to admit my fave U2 albums are achtung, zooropa and Pop, there's the U2 I fell for, so i was probably wrong looking for more of it on their latest albums. Still better than most of this years' releases. 2.5 stars <br />Cheers, JM
B0006399FS|5.0|The previous reviews here seem to have been a rush to judgment-posted the same day as the CD's release! That's not enough time to judge a cd, especially one from U2, who pack so much into an album. It needs to sink in awhile, as you get used to each track and pick out your favorites. Is \\"HTDAAB\\" as good as \\"Achtung\\" or \\"Joshua\\"? Of course not. But there are some excellent songs here-from the gangbusters \\"Vertigo\\" to the next single \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" to the crunch of \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" to the pop beauty of \\"All Because Of You.\\" My only complaint is the 48-pg book that came with the deluxe set (you also get an extra song \\"Fast Cars\\").  The book is a waste, you'll flip through it once and never look at it again. It doesn't even include the lyrics (as far as I can tell); it's totally illegible. Save your money and buy the single cd release.<br /><br />PS-\\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" is already one of my all-time U2 favorites.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|OK, I REALLY wanted to like this movie! I love monster movies in general, and thoroughly enjoyed Sommers' MUMMY offerings. Well, VAN HELSING zips by like a runaway rocket, exploding and re-exploding before crashing into the dust. I had a hard time following the ultra-slim plot. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckensale run, jump, swing, and careen their way through this blur of a film. Things seem to blow up, catch fire, or erupt about every ten seconds or so, sending some screeching vampire or werewolf to it's doom, while splitting my skull in the process! This might have been halfway fun if the characters had been even two dimensional! I found myself not caring about them one bit. To be fair, the idea of Dracula attempting to conquer the world with an army of undead offspring is pretty cool. This could have been fleshed out into a great series of movies with depth and actual character development. The addition of Frankenstein's monster and the wolfman could (should) have made VH a modern horror classic. Unfortunately, everything is compressed into this hyper-speed fiasco. Imagine if Peter Jackson had squeezed the entire Lord Of The Rings trilogy into a two hour movie. Lots of action and thrills with no real story whatsoever. That's what we get with VAN HELSING. If you crave substance in your movie experience, you won't find it here. If you only want to be bombarded by CGI effects and noise, then this one's for you. Personally, I'd rather drive nails through my forehead...
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I'd never even heard of Marillion until I was reading through a list of someone's reviews looking for some new music and I came across this 2 cd set. I've gotta say, this album is fantastic!  I don't know how to describe it; kind of like Pink Floyd meets the later Beatles meets Sigur Ros.  The album is filled with lush blends of sound effects and instrumentation and the singer's voice fits perfectly along with everything else.  I'm still getting used to this new and unusual sound, but I think it is great and I'm glad I found it.  The ultimate chill out album.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I absolutely love this album. Simple Plan really brings out a side of them that not many thought they had. Their songs can easily be related to. They proved that they can be serious, while still having fun with their music. From fast up beat songs like Shut Up, to slow, herartfelt ballads, like Untitled, Simple Plan has taken my likeness for them and pushed it up a notch. I love the album so much. My only disappointment is that its not long enough...I just want to hear more. To anyone who hasnt purchased this album, you definitely should.
0783225733|5.0|W. Wawrzyniak \\"Woj\\" <br /> <br />I am sure glad to find your letter.  I could never find out why Ron Howard would do this to his greatest work \\"Apollo 13.\\"  In some way I wish he hadn't but at least this explains the difference between my VHS copy and my Widescreen DVD. <br /> <br />I already posted a letter about another film called \\"Colossus - The Forbin Project.\\"  \\"Universal\\" is releasing this only in 1.33 or Full Screen version while it was film at 2.35:1Ratio.  So I use \\"Apollo 13\\" as an example of how \\"Universal\\" and the rest have been cropping other movies. <br /> <br />Your letter shows that I was wrong when it comes to Apollo 13.  Yet, the majority of the 1.85 movies are nothing more than 1.33 with black bar cropping the picture.  I hope someday they well stop doing this. <br />
B00009ZYC1|5.0|I'm sorry that it took so long for me to see this film. We recieved Shrek and Shrek II, from the kids..who were horrified to learn we had not seen either. Usually our taste in entertainment is miles apart from our kid's and grandkids, but this film hit a home run with me. I laughed so hard I hurt the next day. The really neat part is that no one character stole the show. Even though it kind of followed a traditional story line it was just enough different to keep ya guessing. The actors chosen to do the characters were perfect. Mike Meyers is a genius with voices, Eddie Murphy's donkey was absolutely right on. Great story, great characters and a happy ending...what more could you want? Highly recommend.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|This trite, formula-governed movie should be an embarassment to Keaton and Nicholson, or their agents, who generally find better scripts.  Obvious, predictable, its saving grace is Keanu Reeves' performance as the perfect American male.  Anyone who enjoys membership in the latter category should watch this movie to see how it's done.  Looking for a good film?  Look elsewhere.
B0006399FS|1.0|hey Bono, what's wrong with Pop ? <br />why did you leave all creativity and vanguard after Pop ? <br />what the hell is so wrong with Pop ??? <br />It was an excellent and essential record, but now in this new century u2 is a band that lives because of the past, without ideas, nor inspiration, nor innovation, neither surprises, etc. This disc is a nastiness <br /> <br />Please remember fans are not lambs !!! <br /> <br />
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This album isn't Sarah doing pop or uplifting guitar ballads.  This is Sarah doing seductive vocals with a backdrop of soothing music.  The album is refreshing because it is more serious than some of her others, however that also gives some of the tracks a heavy feeling. There are a lot of great songs on this album, and there aren't really any I don't like.  There is a lot less guitar in this album, but I like it because the instrumentation fits very well with her voice.  I think this album is one of her finest, particularly the last song \\"dirty little secret.\\"  Anyone that likes previous Sarah albums will like this and anyone that likes a soft seductive melody will like this as well.
1591840562|5.0|This book can save you thousands upon thousands of dollars -- it's THAT good. <br /> <br />As a one-man startup, I was afraid that this book would be \\"too high\\" for me. While seemingly directed at the larger startups, with chapters on finding money, hiring, etc etc (stuff I won't get to until years from now), it is nonetheless valuable for anyone who is starting out on their own. <br /> <br />If nothing else, the overall philosophy of this book (love what you do and change the world) is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />Highly, highly recommended. You will not be disappointed.
B0006399FS|4.0|For longtime U2 fans, I challenge you all to ask yourself a simple question.  Has the band ever disappointed?  I realize that's an open ended question.  My point being, I can't ever remember buying a new U2 album and thinking that I was let down.  I can honestly say that.  After listening to HTDAAB several times today, one thing comes to mind.  These guys are incredibly consistent and continually put out great, artistic music.  Think about their career, their legacy.  For 25 years, U2 has not had a slip.  People point to \\"POP\\" as a failure. I completely disagree.  Have you heard songs like \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" and \\"Staring at the Sun?\\"   25 years, 11 albums, not a bad album in the bunch.   Although this album doesn't quite have the cohesiveness of Joshua and Achtung, the immediacy of War, the elegance of Unforgettable Fire, and the experimentation of Zooropa and Pop, it does carry all those elements.  It's just a great record.  The standouts are the explosive Vertigo, the touching Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own, the in your face and angry Love and Peace or Else and the heartwarming Miracle Drug. In my opinion, Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own will be placed in the U2 pantheon.  Tremendous.  This will make an excellent Holiday gift.
0767814037|5.0|I've had this movie for about 5 years and can't remember how many times I've watched it. The cast is superlative..everyone of them is completely believable. The sets are outstanding and the vista's are really worth staring at. This is one of Kevin Costner's best performance's, right up there with Dances with Wolves. Danny Glover, who is one of my favorite actors, gives a fine performance. Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Linda Hunt, and Brian Dennehy all turned in outstanding performance's. I think the casting director should have gotten an oscar for putting this cast together. <br />Highly recommend this film...even if you arn't a fan of westerns this one will entertain you.
0739313126|5.0|I could not put this book down! Rarely do you find such a readable novel that is intelligently written and filled with thought provoking questions. I can't wait for the sequel!
B0006399FS|3.0|There are some fine tracks here: Vertigo, All Because of You, and Yahweh all rock like U2 is supposed to.  Some of the other songs are pretty good, but over all it is not the album I would have wanted from U2.  The new Alarm album (In The Poppy Fields) is much closer to what U2 should have done - too bad that record been completely overlooked by radio and the mainstream music press.  Also, Green Day's latest makes a much louder statement - the kind we expect from the likes of U2.  I hope there are a huge number of b-sides and extra tracks some place - as is usually the case - to help fill the void until next time.
B00005JMAH|1.0|There has always been a huge problem with filmmakers and movie studios always blowing dust when they try to make a movie which is massively popular as Harry Potter. I've never really understood understood the fascination with the books but I became a fan of the Harry Potter movies when I went to the theatres to see the first two films. <br /> <br />While I've never read the books, the first two films were cleverly made and they were enjoyable to watch. The problem this time around? Alfonso Cuaron does not know what he's doing because I found myself confused as to the direction of the movie, very little dialogue was evident to hodl my attention and the stiff acting by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was so bad I fell asleep watching this movie. <br /> <br />Again, the proble was ... this film was loosely based on the nove. <br /> <br />I'm a very firm believer that there are no such terms as bad actors. Cuaron's adaption had no sense of direction, left me (as a potential future fan of this series) bored out of my mind with no inclination to watch this particular entry again in the future. The only cool part of the movie were the scenes with the Hippogriff. <br /> <br />Also, due to the fact that this book was longer than the previous two films, this film should have been longer and the film suffered intolerably that I could not recommend this film to anyone. Waterworld and Titanic were ten times more better than this drudgery of a movie.
B000060P79|1.0|go buy a new vocie pierre with all the money you so<br />inapropietly earned. you suck and (as a fellow Amazon writer<br />once said) so dose (Empty-V)MTV. it's like a sell outs channel.<br />only the big sell out bands r played on it. these guy mix there<br />titles up. it should be pads helmets and no balls......
B0006399FS|4.0|I would like to give those two Irish lads thanks for saving this album.  It is a very decent album, but Bono's voice just isn't the same anymore.  Sure, it still has that signature emotion and soul but his pure voice seems strained here.  Maybe I'm just too in love with 80's U2 when he was untouchable but this is a shame, and so is the efforts of their drummer Larry Mullen, did he even show up at the studio? <br /> <br />On the other hand, Edge came to play.  People were expecting a album with 11 songs that sounded like \\"Vertigo\\" but please, the guitar work on this record is phenomenal.  True Brilliance.  His solos on \\"All Because of You\\" and \\"Love & Peace or Else\\" are perfect, and he saves his best for \\"Miracle Drug.\\"  The definition of the slide guitar solo.  Great stuff.   <br /> <br />Even still, Adam Clayton even outshines Edge on HTDAAB.  His basslines are heavy, straightforward, and just wicked.  He perfects the brilliant tunes here like \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Vertigo\\" with his bulldozer riffs, but he saves songs like \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" which would be a George Michael song if it wasn't for his absolutely killer basslines. <br /> <br />U2 are still a great band, but I think it's time for u2 fans to stop expecting them to make their best album.  It won't happen.  Think of it this way: No other band that actually survived into their 40s has ever made an album this good.
B0006399FS|3.0|The lyrics suck.  Bono should be embarassed. <br /> <br />\\"Tough.  You think you've got the stuff.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Listen to me now.  I need to let you know.\\" <br /> <br />Weak, weak, weak.  Embarrassing lyrics.  I give it three stars because it at least \\"sounds like U2\\", and that ain't all bad. <br /> <br />Also--where's the vocal bravado in the lower ranges of his voice?  It's very thin these days.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This Box Set is wonderfull!!!!!!!! amazing!!!!!!!! with beautiful songs and one of the great Mike Show ever!\\" Bucarest \\".<br />5 stars !!!!! for this Box Set!!!!!!!<br />;-)
0553266306|5.0|Every now and then I get a yen for a good page turner, a real pot boiler.  An airport read, if you will.  Day of the Jackal fits the bill, perfectly.  The one probelm with this book is that it is almost impossible to put aside.  Forsyth weaves a superb yarn from a historical context, namely French military disaffection with DeGaulle and a subsequent plot to kill him.  The suspense generated is equal to any novel I've read.  Make sure you have a few hours at a stretch to read this.
B000001DZQ|5.0|Acquire this CD . If you are a hard fan of Roy Buchanan or even if you are not you will be surprised for a long , long time .<br />Green onions , The Mesiah will come , After hours , I'm evil , Pete's blues and Five string blues reveal by themselves the powerful presence the freshness interpretative and the enormous scope of Buchanan .<br />It is impossible for you to make a list of the top twenty blues in any age without including at least four or five of this legendary icon painfully absent .
B0006399FS|1.0|And it works !!! you can see many fans loving this soup...but...more and more fans are waking up ( at last !! ). Bono promised heaven with this album, and we found hell.  <br />now is better to learn how to sing again Bono, really. <br />I'm really upset by this fake album, really. <br />The same songs, the same guitars, the same rough voice, the same production, all is the same !!! where's something new here ? <br />The only worthy song is City Of Blinding Lights, the rest...just forget it.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Like many, I am a big fan of Greek history and the glimpses we get of pre-literate Greece from oral epics like \\"The Iliad.\\" <br /> <br />Many reviews of this movie seem misplaced. First and foremost, Homer's Iliad was an instructive lesson about the rage of Achilles. Secondly, it was a narrative tale about the siege and fall of Ilium (Troy). <br /> <br />Achilles is the focus of the story and also the movie. Helen, Paris, Hector, Patroclus, the Gods, etc are all in place to enhance the tale of Achilles' rage. In addition, Achilles is not a particularly deep character and is obsessed with glory and heroism. Many think Brad Pitt was miscast in this role, but I disagree. An eloquent or more compassionate actor may not have played the part of the vain brute as well as Pitt. I don't think Pitt acted particularly well, but Achilles is a narrow character in the original text. <br /> <br />The movie is also criticized for omitting the Greek gods entirely, but there is no denying that the movie's characters constantly give proper reverence to their gods. The gods do not intervene directly, but their presence is felt constantly during the film. One can view this as an attempt to make the story more historical, rather than mythological. The circumstances of Achilles' death at the end of the movie make plain that this was the director's intention. <br /> <br />Outstanding acting performances come from Eric Bana (Hector), Brian Cox (Agamemnon), Brendan Gleeson (Menelaus), Peter O'Toole (Priam), Garrett Hedlund (Patroclus), Rose Byrne (Briseis), and Sean Bean (Odysseus). Honestly, I don't see the big complaints about the acting in this  movie. Aside from the obvious marquee signings of Pitt and Orlando Bloom (Paris), this movie is overflowing with fine acting performances. <br /> <br />The choreography of the battle scenes is excellent. While the battles between the computer-generated armies was reminiscent of Peter Jackson's top-notch work with The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Troy truly shines in the one-on-one battles. The first champion dispatched by Achilles early in the movie provides a taste of more electrifying battles between Hector & Patroclus, Hector & Ajax, and finally Achilles & Hector.   <br /> <br />From a story-telling standpoint, the only weaknesses in the movie were the non-canonical deaths of both Menelaus & Agamemnon. In the original Greek tale, they meet their ends in dramatically different fashion than in the movie. <br /> <br />I've always thought that the siege of Troy would make a great movie, if told properly. But I never expected it to be made in a way that truly exceeded my expectations and hopes. This was a very good movie, in my opinion.
B00005JLEX|3.0|Seinfeld grew to be one of the best comedy shows on TV, but it isn't hard to understand why it originally struggled. During the first two seasons the actors were still trying to define their roles and many of the episodes were slow paced, tended to mope, and the actors often had a whiny dialogue delivery. By the end of season two, and the Chinese Restaurant episode, the characters were getting better and the show was starting to take shape. Probably the best part of this DVD collection is the \\"Making of Seinfeld\\" extra. Don't get me wrong, I think Seinfeld is great, but seasons 1 & 2 pale in comparison to the middle and later years of its stay on TV.
B0002VKZTI|5.0|There are probably alot of people who think of Eumir Deodato as the Brazilian equivilant of Ramsey Lewis and Bob James.That probably stems from his work as an orchestral arranger,and I must say 'Love Island' isn't exactly free of that quality.But Deodato is a clever,inventive arranger and KNOWS where and where not to put strings and horns on a song so they sound artistic and not contrived.With the help of members of Earth,Wind & Fire,The Crusaders and George Benson 'Love Island' showcases a sincere interest in R&B and funk.\\"Area Code 808\\" is a GROOVE-full of hot guitar riffs and driving synth licks.\\"Whistle Bump\\",\\"Chariot Of The Gods\\" and \\"Pina Colada\\" are in the same kind of vein.\\"San Juan Sunset\\" and the title cut have a very mid 70's Earth,Wind & Fire ballad quality to them,only without vocals.The best way to describe much of this music would be lite funk,especially on a version  of \\"Take The A Train\\" (yes,it's Ellington's composition).But on each of these eight cuts I have nothing negative to say and I'm very glad that Wounded Bird has started to reissue Deodato's records.They've done a great job at putting fusion back out on CD and in that genre (notably on the R&B and funk side of it) this is high quality music.
B0000039PW|2.0|I'm sorry but I had to give this man 2 stars. Let Me just say that this man will never be 2pac and therefore there is no comparison. You fools on the east coast just jock him cuz he was the closest thing to pac at that time. I think Jay-z is harder than big. Anyway, ready to die was an ok album but go cop some of pac's [...]. Every joint is a banger. You listen to this album they aren't bangers. Track 12 he talks about him and his bi*tch. What is that? Oh yea some creative master at work. 2pac broght the hood [...] into and the concious rap. It was always hard listening to that man's song. I just think that BIG was coo but he is way overrated. Even though you is from the east coast you can still admit that pac is better cuz its the truth pimpin. Ive said my piece west side till I die. Pac forever L Fam
B00005YUNY|5.0|Firstly, I think the Symphonic Tour was one of the greatest of all Yes tours. And being a Philadelphia (their adopted home town) native, and seeing every Philly Yesshow since 1974--even flying up for every show from my present home in Texas to \\"keep the streak alive\\"--this particular DVD strikes a chord in me. The editing and camera work on this DVD is impeccable. Including the cuts to the orchestra members absolutely enjoying the experience and the perfectly behaved Amsterdam audience shots were nice wide angle views of the stage.<br /><br />The second disc somewhat documents their Philly tour stop at the outdoor orchestra facility, the Mann Music Center (always dreamed they'd play there)---and a peek at the Roger Dean (artist of their album covers) art exhibit, which I attended. All in all, personal memories aside, great DVD.<br /><br />My favorite feature on the DVD was the \\"animation on/off\\"- where you could disable all animation that were interspersed during the show and even eliminates the closing credits during the last couple of minutes of the concert. In other words, just the show and no distractions. Very cool feature.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially at Amazon.com's price!!
B0006399FS|4.0|I got lucky. I bought the collectors set and got 1 DVD and 2 CD's. Marketing error? <br /> <br />Anyway, I am not sure what you people have been listening to these days but this album is very refreshing compared to all the other junk that is polluting the music scene. Seriously, do most people who gave this album a bad review idolize Brittney Spears and Jessica Simpson? Are you used to canned music with 5 second hooks that repeat over and over again so it brainwashes you into buying the album? <br /> <br />The person who stated this album does not have any hooks must be into RAP. BTW, I love RAP. There are hooks if you \\"listen\\". <br /> <br />This album comes from a band who has endured for decades. They keep reinventing themselves everytime. Whether you agree with their experimentation is up to you. But this is a solid album. <br />Yes this album might be a little \\"lower key\\" than there usual stuff but if you have a good system and can pick up everything that is going on in every song you will be very pleased. <br /> <br />This is no Joshua Tree. Your right. It's not Zooropa, POP or All that you cant leave behind either...Did you like Passengers Soundtrack? If not than I can see why you trashed this album. <br /> <br />This album is another shot at art, music and experimentation. It works. The lyrics are applicable to what they are writing about and succeeds. <br /> <br />All I know to smack this album shows that lack of open mindedness that is destroying modern music today. This album is special in its own right and has a spot in U2's collection.  <br /> <br />The band will forge ahead and continue to bless us with more music in the future. I am happy with this album, my purchase and look forward to going over all the lyrics and hearing the band wield their magic once again. <br /> <br />You got U2, Lillywhite, Eno and Flood custom packaging this music for you. What else do you need?  <br /> <br />Opinions are like whiners. Everyone has one. This group is amazing and should be credited for every production including this one. I give it 4/5 stars because Im not done fully listening to it yet. <br /> <br />Buy the album and enjoy. Close the mouth and open the ears. The album speaks for itself and stands on it's own two legs without support from its fans.
B00069L0XG|5.0|First off. To the person who did nothing but diss this movie, you obviously need to go find something to do. You wrote that review because you were disappointed that it wasn't as \\"game-like\\" as it should have been. Me, being one of the biggest fans of Resident Evil, think the same, but I loved the movie. Jill and Alice were both great, and it actually had a lot to do with the games. You see, if you were a real fan, you would know that. Obviously however, you are just a wanna-be. Do not listen to people like him. <br />     Second, for the actual review. Resident Evil Apocalypse was full of everything you would want in a horror/action/suspense/thriller movie. Lickers appear yet again in this movie, which I was quite glad to see. I want to see the Neptune shark(s) in a Resident Evil movie, though. The Nemesis looked great. Not exactly like the game, but close enough.  <br />To sum it up, Alice starts off as she ended the first movie, alone. She gets geared up and finds out she was tested on, (Which is what created to her new super strength) She meets with Jill and the others, ends up on a mission to save Dr. Ashford's daughter (I did not see any relation to Alexia Ashford from RE Code: veronica, though.), which would lead to their evacuation of the city. They find her, and meet him. He gets shot, Alice fights Nemesis, who remembers her and joins her side (The only thing I did not exactly like...Nemesis was the big bad in RE3. But, due to the new story, I was able to deal with the new idea.) And they all fly off in a helicopter. (Not the Nemesis) The Helicopter crashes, and Alice appears to be burned to death. Hehe, if you haven't seen the rest of the movie, i'll let you see the rest for yourself. <br />    As for the boxed set perspective, I am extremely happy that they did this. My old copy of RE1, (The one I bought the day RE1 came out) Is pretty worn out. I watched it so many times, and brought it to so many places, that it is all messed up. So, I figure why not kill two birds with one stone. And to answer the \\"Special Features\\" question, I am sure they will have them.  <br />     So, RE2 is definately a great movie. Some people may not like it, but that is because they really have no taste in movies. Both RE1 and RE2 are great movies. Definately buy this dvd boxed set.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is without a doubt U2s most consistent record. <br /> <br />Because all the songs are guitar driven unlike  <br />\\"All that you can't leave behind\\" in fact its probably their best to listen to as a whole. <br /> <br />There are no straight forward tracks like \\"Staring at the Sun\\" or \\"One\\" as every song has a big wide sound to it. <br /> <br />Is this U2s best album - yeah I would say so.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|In the end that's all that matters, and what the whole thing was and is about!    The quality of sound and picture (as explained in the dvd-book) is not as good as I had hoped for it to be, I actually thought there'd be a dts-version of Do They Know It's Christmas in my naivity, but of course entertainment is far from the only reason for this release. Far from.    I was only six years old in 1985, so I did not have many memories from this great event taking place at Wembley, Philadelphia and on TV of course, when me and my friends gathered up infront of the tv to watch this circus of the worlds' greatest artists at the time joining eachother in the attempt to try and make the world a better place. But for some reason I remembered Dire Straits because of the cool guitar-riffs on Money For Nothing, and I also remembered Sting in dueth with Mark Knopfler (though at the time I had no idea who he was : today my favorite artist actually).     Musically, and the performances considered, Sting does a great contribution here, but it actually never quite \\"lifts the roof\\" with any of the artists before Queen enters the stage. They steal the show, without doubt - and now, finally, I understand the sence of this statement, the performance of Queen is the most rememberable of Live AID. And Mercury beats them all, and thanks to the release of this dvd - he'll always do.    Great show, greatest consept. Still saving lives!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|These are some of the terms that come to mind when I think of this brilliant record from Unearth.  Somehow, you will not find this record on many people's \\"Best Metal Records of 2004\\" list.  Well, I can assure you that its on mine.  I put the caliber of this album alongside other great releases of this year, such as God Forbid's \\"Gone Forever\\" or Mastodon's \\"Leviathan\\".  I appreciate what bands like Unearth do to seperate themselves from the carbon copy \\"metalcore\\" garbage bands that seem to be coming out of the woodwork lately.  One way they do this is to obtain a heavy sound in other ways besides low guitar tuning and screaming.  They incorporate many classic metal elements like searing lead guitar work that, this year, has only been paralleled by God Forbid.  A metal purist should love this album.  If you are still not sure, listen to \\"Endless\\", \\"The Great Dividers\\", and \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\" first to get an idea of the sound of this record.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|Well, the DVD probably isn't worth getting if you already have all the DVDs, which I do (other than revisted and the new disc). The Matrix was great, but it sure fell apart intellectually with the second movie, then entirely on the last one. Still, it's a worthwhile and entertaining trilogy. <BR>To get to the point, Jeff claimed that there were new transfers. There are not. The only remastered movie is the original Matrix, and the differences are likely not great.
B00005JLEX|1.0|In the words of Comicbook Guy on the Simpsons: \\"Worst Show Ever\\"!!!! This show is crap,and its on tv every minute, so why buy the lousy dvd's. So you can see some stupid extras. I try watching it, and its just so stupid. There is no story. One episode is about shrinkage, the next show is about Keith Hernendez's loogie, the next one George is making like a bed under his desk. No plot, no cliffhangers, just dumb simple minded buffoonery. Lousy show. If you wanna watch something smart, and that doesn't kill brain cells, watch a smart show like Cheers, or M*A*S*H.
B00065JTBA|4.0|It's a magnanimious occasion when a rock band can endure 20 years in the business. There was something right about the band and their music when 100,000,000 albums were sold. Some bands fade away soon after they begin and some last awhile and then fade as well. Bon Jovi made it. <br /> <br />Given the label originally cast upon the band of hair metal popsters, Bon Jovi had a different style and hooked many people into their songs and albums even if you found it hard to swallow or to even admit to your friends you liked Bon Jovi. <br /> <br />And to celebrate we are presented in what can be considered some record company contratual obligation to many. However, if you are a true fan of the band then you will see these selections as something new and sought after with a bit of filler. <br /> <br />To the casual fan you will lose out on the impact that Bon Jovi gave rock history. And to the new fan you will be horrified that this is the band that endured 20 years. Put it into perspective that this is a collection of songs that never got released originally for a reason. <br /> <br />To celebrate 20 years it would seem more logical to give a box set of hits and album cuts and these rare gems in a substantial package as this seems to be. However, I really enjoyed listening in on the other aspects of Bon Jovi's recording sessions for certain album releases. I even went as far as wondering what Slippery When Wet and New Jersey would have sounded like if this or that song was included. <br /> <br />Casual and new fans beware. But to the real Bon Jovi fans out there you may relish in the material herein and look upon these songs as something new and exciting.
B0006399FS|1.0|Listened to the tracks. The lyrics made me queasy. \\"Freedom has the scent like the top of a baby's head..\\" That's horrible! What happened to this band? Bono's lyrics.
B0006399FS|5.0|Simply what do you want from U2. This albums contains some great rock tunes such as Vertigo, Love & Peace Or Else, City Of Blinding Lights and All Because Of You, it has great mellow songs such as Miracle Drug and Sometimes You Can't... <br /> <br />What exactly do you want, this is pop-rock, nothing else.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie in my opinion was better than the first. Gollum had much more of a role than just looking and getting mentioned. Also the hour long Helm's Deep Scene is some of the best cinametagrophy and computer generation I have ever seen. This movie has some of the best actors in it, and they play there parts just as the book was written. It is a masterpiece.
B00068IOWC|1.0|If you think the joshua tree was their best record, if you thought it was cool when the edge started dressing like a boyband has-been, if you were one of the people that hailed \\"all you can't leave behind\\" as a \\"return to the old sound,\\" then you'll probably love this bad record. The truth is, joshua tree sucked, the edge is a loser who just wanted to sell records to pay for a new roof for his mansion, and all you can't leave behind was recycled american pop, thrown in our faces to get at our wallets. \\"Boy\\" through \\"war\\" were Irish teenage frustration albums, and there is something great about them (except for maybe \\"october\\"). \\"Unforgettable\\" through \\"Joshua\\" were silly experimentation with american music. \\"Achtung\\" was recorded in germany and they got Eno on the team. \\"Zooropa\\" had ups and downs, but the direction they were going in was clear. They got Flood for the production on \\"Pop\\" and it turned out to be an intelligent, sarcastic, forward-thinking record. Seriously, look at who produced each record, and you'll realize where the sounds come from. You think clayton or mullen do much? I'd give credit to Flood for that one. I also heard that they had a big white board of things Bono was not allowed to put into the songs, because they would be too stupid and cliche. \\"how to dismantle\\" is worse than \\"all you can't leave.\\" You don't even get something catchy, like \\"beautiful day.\\" I've heard the record through a few times, and i can't think of one bass line, one bit of lyric, one melody. At least on \\"all you can't leave\\" i could remember stupid lines like \\"i'm like a mole digging in a hole, now, excavation\\" or \\"you've got to get yourself together.\\" This record had nothing. they are done. I was hoping they would at least go for silly electronic gimics, anything to keep my attention. Basically, it's a straight rock record, stripped down to guitar, bass, drums, and vocal, but without any of the energy of the early days. They are old and tired, and apparently don't evencare anymore. Starting with a high point with \\"boy\\" and ending at an even higher point with \\"pop\\" would have been a sweet career. Now i'm just wondering how many bad records they're going to do until they finally stop.
B000068QY7|3.0|Sure its return to a more original soundng Oasis, but the songs just are'nt here on this album. <br /> <br />Apart from \\"Stop Crying your heart out\\" which is the best song Oasis have done since Wonderwall. <br /> <br />The album just sounds way to polished and fancy. <br />Don't get this.
B0006399FS|3.0|I think most of us can think of at least one food we didn't like as a kid that now we can't live without. Stop asking yourself if this is \\"Ground-Breaking\\" music. Instead, just listen to it, or at least play it in the background for a while. You might develope a taste for it, or not. I like what I've heard so far. (3 listens in) Some of the tracks are starting to stand out and relay some kind of human feeling. Forget the star rating I was required to give, I'm not going to give a star rating just yet. We are all still in the early childhood listening stages of this album. Oh Yeah! I almost forgot.....U2 ROCKS!
B0006399FS|5.0|Got a copy at a midnight buy last night. . . and well, ten listens in, I am extremely happy.  I've always thought it's pretentious to write a review that tries to heavily critique songwriting that I'll never hold a candle too, and doubly so on on the first day.  I just wanted to share in the party on the first day.  So far it's everything I hoped it would be from the interviews that hyped it during the recording.  I reckon I will grow to love it as much as any U2 album, and that is saying an awful lot for me.  Strong strong strong stuff.  Cannot wait for the tour.
0142000663|1.0|This book was 600 pages written purly about a bunch of hicks from Oklahoma starving. Thanks, but no thanks.
B000002C25|5.0|What a #$%$# awesome album. <br />Noel Gallaghar (songwriter) claims that this album is absolute rubbish, and many others but really its only because its not an album thats an absolute classic. <br /> <br />Actually I'm glad they released this album \\"Be Here Now\\" cause its just damn cool. <br />Each song has a massive wall of sound of guitars and and the majority of them all are very long, and theres nothing wrong with something different. <br /> <br />Heak, its better than \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\" and \\"Heathen Chemistry.\\"
B0006399FS|4.0|I love the new CD I got today but I heard my friend's collectors edition and he got this song called \\"Fast Cars\\" on it.  It's AMAZING!!! It's the most experimental u2 has been since POP.  It has middle-eastern guitars on it and I think it could have been a hit.  What were they thinking??? I also downloaded this song called \\"Mercy\\" which the site said would be a B-Side on the next single.  It sounds like something off of \\"Achtung Baby\\", it's amazing.  I seriously think both of these could have been singles. <br /> <br />I guess I'm happy with the CD, but I would have put these two songs in and taken out \\"Yahweh\\" and \\"Orginal of the Species\\", their good but there are too many songs with the theme of love in theme.   <br /> <br />My favorite is \\"All Because of You\\" and \\"Vertigo\\", real rock&roll and real u2.  EDGE IS THE MAN!!! I would give it a better rating, but I'm kind of madd they didn't put those songs on.  Oh well.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0739313118|1.0|I highly recommend this book.  It's both interesting and thought provoking.  But whatever you do, please don't buy the cassette version.  The cassettes come tangled and warped and the second one from the end flat out broke.  Save your money for the hardback or CD version.
B000000W5L|2.0|For the life of me I cant understand why the critics cream over this album. Its one one those albums thats really not all that good but at the same time very trendy to put on ones greatest of all time list. The album isnt bad , but it just isnt quite up to par with the likes of Sticky Fingers or Let It Bleed<br />( two phenomenal albums )The first five tracks are actually pretty good , particularly Shake your Hips , Rip This Joint and Rocks Off. From there its all downhill with the exeptions of All Down The Line and Stop Breaking Down. the majority of the album is very mediocre ,and actually boring .. especially for a band with the prominence of the Rolling Stones .It seems to me that this is the Stones attempt at comming up with something akin to the White Album , and it quite frankly is not in the same league.<br />The Rolling Stones have a slew of great albums ... this just isnt one of em
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang's work should be considered the standard entry level work into this particular area of history.  The writing is solid and easy to read without overburdening the reader with constant numbers and citations (although there are more than enough of both).  Chang does a thorough job of providing citations to first hand accounts and other works, although some sections contain very graphic and shocking descriptions which may offend.  Given the history between China and Japan, some trace amounts of inter-Asian racism are expected; however Chang keeps these to a minimum.  The last parts of the book are a little weaker, but it is a superb work on a very bleak subject.
B0006399FS|4.0|I believe that all those reviewers who gave then a 2 or less will definitely be changing their minds once they listen to it a few more times.  Stand out songs are Vertigo, Miracle Drug, A man and a woman and Crumbs from your table.  Although its not as good as Achtung, they are back to making awesome music (helped by the fact that the Edge is back in full force on this one).  I'm not sure if I like Yahweh though.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock's trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it's one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can't imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter.  Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (\\"Miss Torso\\"), then one of the last surviving cast members.  Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed.
0316096199|4.0|I read Lucky after I finished The Lovely Bones, also by Sebold.  The thing that I loved about Lucky is that it could happend to anyone.  This could be about you, your wife, daughter, sister, neighbor, anyone.  Rape happens in all walks of life and Lucky tells the tale of how it not only effects the victim, but an entire community.  An enthralling read.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I own 500 cds and this one is my favorite.  Many of the other 1,500+ reviewers have already said what can be said about this great album so I won't drone on.  It's simply awesome.   <br /> <br />Radiohead are the Pedro Martinez of music...simply unstoppable for that stretch in the '90s.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The \\"Passion of the Christ\\" is certainly the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life, simply because the movie is centered on a burning question about life after death. The movie (whether a documentary/not) is about the last 12 hours before the death of Jesus. Why he came in the first place (shown as flashbacks in the movie) and why he died (so we may be reconciled to God & have eternal life). It is very detailed in the suffering and humiliation he endures. (I'd be careful with having children younger than 15 see this movie)    It starts with Jesus in the garden where he prays for God's help and mercy before he is betrayed by one of his disciples (who had been bribed by the priests at the time). He is handed over to the priests who question him and find him guilty for blasphemy from what he said about being the Son of God, this is after the false witnesses testimonies were found to contradict.     He is taken to Pilate the Roman Governor of the time who finds no fault with him. For this reason he is tried before the king of his province, who also finds no fault in him. He is then returned to the Roman governor who orders that Jesus be crucified to please the people, so there is no uprising among them. The movie goes on to show every stage of his crucifixion in details. It ends with his resurrection.    As for those concerned that the actor who plays Jesus is expressionless, well it's because that is what happened as recorded in the bible. Jesus never once tried to defend himself, he spoke very few words at his trials. And so it is in the movie. But even though there isn't a lot of talking, there is much loving in his eyes. For instance, he comforts his mother under so much pain and agony.    For those uncomfortable with the movie for whatever reason, well you might want to ask why. This is not just for \\"the sake of religion\\" but it's about finding out why you are not comfortable and see what bothers you and try to find answers. One way is to go see the movie without any prejudice (christian or not). And find your own (correct) meaning to it.    I think this is an awesome movie about love. Which isn't exactly the way Hollywood usually portrays it (love = sex). It is the story of one who loves enough to die for those he loves. I hope this helps.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways. It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off. It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away. (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest \\"safe house\\" has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for his music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head. Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be angry if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)

B0006399FS|4.0|ATYCLB was a return to form for U2.  True... it may have appeared as though they took a step back and went a bit retro on themselves, but the songwriting and performances are much improved than previous albums.  And here we have U2's latest album, HTDAAB.  There have been a lot of reviewers that have been disappointed that the album doesn't rock more.  And I have to wonder... are they listening to the same album I am?  THE JOSHUA TREE will always be my fav U2 album.  ACHTUNG BABY coming up close behind, and now I actually like this new U2 album over ATYCLB.  The new U2 album in more cohesive and better constructed.  These songs seem to have more raw energy than than any of their previous albums, including ATYCLB.    VERTIGO - Is a great lead single.  Yes it's glossy... yes it's commercial... but it's a great song to rock out and have fun to.    SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T MAKE IT... - What a great song!  One of my all time favorite \\"slow\\" U2 songs.  Call it sentimental... I like what Bono has to say.      LOVE AND PEACE OR ELSE - What a great change up from the 4/4 beats.  This song is dark, rocks, and reminded me a bit of later Depeche Mode songs... in it's style and sound.    CITY OF BLINDING LIGHTS, ALL BECAUSE OF YOU & CRUMBS FROM YOUR TABLE - all have an energy, and feel that makes me really question why people think this is a mellow album?  Compaired to VELVET REVOLVER maybe, but not previous U2 albums.    A MAN AND A WOMAN - Another great song, with a great CLAYTON bass line.      So... I welcome this new album with a smile on my face.  I thought THE EDGE took a back seat on past U2 albums... and he doesn't here... which really amps up the energy on this album.  I also commend BONO on not being afraid to push his voice as far as it can go if not more.   I was worried U2 were going to become lathargic and unimportant... but on the contrary... this is one of their best albums to date.    Good job guys... you've made me a believer that you are one of the best bands...ever.
B000089RVX|5.0|So many airheads. Evanescence never claimed to be goth, christian, metal or any other type of genre. They're simply a band. They play the music they like to, if you don't get it, don't listen to it. I've been a fan of Evanescence since early February of 2003 when a local DJ played Bring me to life. I immediately turned the radio up because my reaction was, \\"My God, who is that singing?\\" I had to wait a month for this cd and it was well worth it. During that time, I went back and got everything I could find. Their first 2 ep's and Origin. And a lot of unreleased material on the 'net. I don't get people who say they're playing Bring me to life over and over again. Have you even heard the original? And the original song Tourniquet, in my opinion, sucks. Evanescence turned it into an amazing song and Amy screaming I WANT TO DIE! mirrors a lot of the emotions and feelings that many people have grown up with, myself included. That's not goth, that's life. As for those people who think they sound like \\"Linkin Park with a chick\\", you've obviously been misinformed. Yes, I like LP, but they're nothing alike. I'd suggest the people who are bashing Evanescence, listen to the whole album, otherwise, just shut up. Those of us who've been with Ev for a while are tired of hearing it. If you have an open mind, pick this up. I highly recommend it.
6305047529|5.0|While WONDER MAN and THE COURT JESTER might be more consistently wacky, I thought THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (TSLoWM) brought out the vulnerable side of Danny Kaye, one of my faves since childhood (I never missed any of Kaye's movies on WPIX when I was growing up). It usually gets on my nerves when I see movie characters allowing themselves to be as put-upon and henpecked as Kaye's Walter is here, but there was a sweetness about him that made me root for him instead of merely growling, \\"Oh, tell 'em all to go to hell already\\" -- and as a result, it's that much more satisfying when Walter finally does tell off his obnoxious so-called friends and loved ones (unlike such \\"comedies of cruelty\\" as MADHOUSE, where the last 10 minutes of Revenge Against The Oppressors are the only entertaining parts of the movie)! Although James Thurber, another of my faves, reportedly tried to buy off producer Samuel Goldwyn to keep the film from being made and hated the finished product, I think perhaps Thurber wasn't being quite fair.  First off, books and film have different storytelling requirements, and second, the first 10 minutes are almost straight from Thurber's story (except it's Walter and his nagging mom instead of a nagging wife), and it seemed to me that the characters and performances had very Thurberesque qualities about them. Boris Karloff and Konstantin Shayne are delightfully unctuous villains (Fun Fact:  their henchman, Henry Corden, later became the voice of Fred Flintstone!). As Walter's literal and figurative dream girl Rosalind van Hoorn, frequent Kaye co-star Virginia Mayo was thoroughly beguiling and never looked lovelier (and hey, the radiant Mayo was a size 12 and nobody considered *her* a \\"plus size,\\" thank you very much! :-). TSLoWM also contains two of my favorite Kaye/Sylvia Fine musical numbers: \\"Symphony for Unstrung Tongue\\" (am I the only one who finds the line \\"He gets so excited that he has a solo passage\\" to be subtly salacious? :-) and \\"Anatole of Paris.\\" To top it all off, it takes place primarily in my hometown and favorite city, New York City, and is set in one of my favorite milieus, pulp magazine publishing!  My hubby and I like to think that Uncle Peter's grand home must be located in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where we used to live, since it looks like the kind of houses we used to see while walking around in the Fieldston area and it didn't seem to take horrifically long for Walter and Rosalind to drive there from the Flatiron district of Manhattan! :-)  (Interestingly, the interior of the van Hoorn home looks a lot like the interior of evil Bruno Anthony's home in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN; anybody know if these scenes might have been shot in the same house/set?) I wish the DVD extras had included deleted scenes (there's a bit in the trailer with Karloff and Corden in a pub that I definitely don't recall seeing in the finished film), but it was nice to see Virginia Mayo still alive and well (and bigger than \\"size 12,\\" but on her it's pleasant plumpness, in my opinion! :-) in the intro and outro, even though she only had time to say one line about most of her co-stars (\\"Ann Rutherford was delightful...Fay Bainter was a consummate actress...\\").of Paris.\\" To top it all off, it takes place primarily in my hometown and favorite city, New York City, and is set in one of my favorite milieus, pulp magazine publishing!

B00005JKG5|2.0|Flashdance, supposedly inspired by a real-life welder-turned-dancer, comes off as a pretty lame flick, but it does bring back my fond memories of the early 80s.  The story itself is predictable, uninspiring, and ends too abruptly.  The dance numbers are ok, nothing extraordinary, although the girls do have beautiful legs.  To be honest I found the movie boring.  Jennifer Beals's interracial beauty was about the only thing that allowed me to finish watching the movie.<br /><br />The DVD is enhanced for 16:9 widescreen and preserves the film quality pretty well.  The audio is too loud on music and too soft on dialogs.  It doesn't have any extra features.  But then, for $12, you get to watch some 80s dancing and some strip club scenes and relive the go-go days, so what more can you ask for?
B0006399FS|4.0|After listening to it about 5 times today, i believe it is a very good album, but not a great one.  i think the great albums are Joshua Tree followed by Achtung Baby.  This isn't on their level but it ranks with many of the good albums.   <br /> <br />many old school fans will be upset this isn't old-U2.  well they have to get over the fact that they won't go back.  U2 has been around for 25 years and if they have stuck for this long, they deserve to experiment and try new things.  they pull off their experiments well anyway.  if you are hoping for old-school U2 like War and Joshua Tree you won't get it.  you also won't get many politically edgy songs like God's Country or the many that are on War. <br /> <br />this is the most eclectic album too.  they sound like old U2 in some songs and very pop-like in others and achtung-ish in many others.   <br /> <br />the thing about most of their albums is that there is at least one hit song on each, with the exception of a few albums (like Zooropa and October).  some of those albums have a lot of duds though.  this album might not have 2 home runs like ATYCLB did.  Beautiful Day and Walk On are on my top 10 U2 songs of all time.  this album has no all-time greats but what they do have is about 5 or 6 songs that are really good...not classics, but they keep you interested in the album from front to finish.   <br /> <br />also, unlike Pop, which had very specific meanings to the songs, these have very broad interpretations that can apply to many more people.  they speak to a wider audience that can understand the lyrics in the context of their own lives.   <br /> <br />1.  Vertigo (9/10) this is just a fun song.  2nd best on the album for me.  the tempo is one of the fastest they have ever had, which is great.  similar to elevation but cooler.  this will be a GREAT song when they perform it live. <br /> <br />2. Miracle Drug (6/10) medium tempo song that has its swells of emotion.  reminds me a lot of Electric Storm which i was not crazy about.  doesn't have a memorable theme to it.  the lyrics don't hit me, but this is one of the songs that many will love, and many will hate.  give it a few chances and then decide. <br /> <br />3. Sometimes you can't make it on your own (7/10) this ballad has a lot of emotion and feeling to it, and a half-decent chorus part.  the lyrics will apply to everyone in some way.  this is not a classic ballad, nowhere close.  but it's a good attempt by the boys. <br /> <br />4. Love and Peace or Else (6/10) this is one of their more politically edgy songs.  it is a song that would fit perfect with their sound in Pop.  that might be good for some and bad for others.  it has one of the more memorable beats.  this is one of their experiments that some will love and others will hate.  i'm cool with it. <br /> <br />5. City of Lights (9/10) best song of the album.  only one that gave me goosebumps the first time i listened to it, and every time after it.  good lyrics.  sounds like Achtung U2 which many will love to hear again.  good upbeat love song that reminds me of 2 hearts beat as one.  this song won't make your top 10 songs, but it will make many top 20's. <br /> <br />6. All Because of You (7/10) old style U2.  the guitars are well established in this one.  This song will be very good live.  i feel like something is missing from this song that keeps it from being great, and it settles for being just good. <br /> <br />7. A man and a woman (8/10) this is the most intruiging songs on this album.  U2 tries to go latin R&B, but they do it well!!!  Bono sounds very good in this song, and if you love Adam Clayton you will get him heavy in this one.  this is very similar to In a Little While on the ATYCLB album, which is a good song too.  i'm glad the boys took a chance with this song and they did a good job.  this will get many different reviews <br /> <br />8. Crumbs from your table (6/10) i'm not crazy about this song but many might like it.  the beat just doesn't hit me.  the lyrics are good and funny at times.  give this one a chance and decide on your own. <br /> <br />9. One step closer (7/10) the song that this reminds me the most of is The First Time but it's not as good.  medium-slow ballad that features Bono mostly.  some will find it bland and stupid but i like the broadness of the lyrics.  they can mean many things to many people, and get you thinking about a lot of things as you listen.  sometimes you need this kind of song. <br /> <br />10. Original of Species (7/10) this song is a lot like crumbs fro your table and miracle drug.  too many songs that sound the same.  but i like this one the most. <br /> <br />11. Yahweh (6/10) nothing special.  filler song mostly.  it won't hit with most people.
B00005HEFS|5.0|In the history of rock and roll this album (known variously as \\"Led Zeppelin IV,\\" \\"Runes\\" and \\"ZOSO\\") is one of the great albums of all time. The sales figures certainly back up that idea, with 22 million albums sold since it game out in 1971. When \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine listed the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" came in at #66, while \\"Physical Grafitti\\" was #70 and \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" #75. Much higher on the list was the group's debut album at #29, which makes sense since the list favors albums that were influential and importance, which is why the Beatles have three of the top five (four of the top ten, five of the top fourteen).<br /><br />If you do not like Led Zeppelin, then there is no earthly reason for this album to change your mind. But if you like their mix of rock, blues and folk, then you would definitely have to count this as one of their best albums. One of the things I find most interesting about this album is how each side (remember, it was actually a thing called a \\"record\\" way back when it first came out and there was an \\"A\\" side and a \\"B\\" side) is set up the same way: two hard rockers, an acoustic piece, and then a much longer track. \\"Side 1\\" ends with the classic \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" while \\"Side 2\\" brings Robert Plant's harmonica out of retirement for what might be the heaviest song in Led Zep's repertoire, \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\" Jimmy Page always did pay attention to the order of the songs and this album clearly evidences the point.<br /><br />Bonzo's drums on \\"Four Sticks\\" provides a nice contrast to Page's acoustic guitar on \\"Going to California,\\" just as the dueling voices of Plant and Sandy Denny, the queen of British folk rock, on \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" (with its Tolkien references) fade away to set up the start of \\"Stairway.\\" We actually used \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" for our homecoming song one year (we had a VERY good high school band teacher), so it always been a special song for me without bringing in the entire \\"most played song of FM radio\\" bit.<br /><br />This is an atypical Led Zeppelin album in one significant regard in that it does not have a blues track (their best one, \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" was on their previous album). So put this down as the best rock album by one of the best rock bands. Just because I do not want to anoint their feet with oil does not mean I do not think that they were damn good at what they did. One thing we can agree on: Led Zeppelin engenders strong feelings from both sides.\\"most played song of FM radio\\" bit.  <br /> <br />This is an atypical Led Zeppelin album in one significant regard in that it does not have a blues track (their best one, \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" was on their previous album).

B0002XDODU|5.0|HAHA I NO THEY ARE GERMAN BUT EVEN WHEN I TRANSLATE I DONT UNDERSTAND, BUT I LOVE THE MUSIC ANY WAY!! THEY TRACKS ARE A MIXTURE OF REALLY HARD ROCK AND ROLL AND THEN A LITTLE UNPLUGGED, THIS IS SIMILAR TO SLIPKNOTS VOL 3 AND NIRVANA UNPLUGGED. <br />REISE REISE- this song isnt the best but the guitar and keyboard are phenominal! <br />MEIN TELL (TEIL)- if you translated the meaning of the title, it would really discust u.. but its good song, but it isnt the best <br />DALAI LAMA- filled with invigorating guitarism, and and creapy german words, best to play for ur 3 year olds birthday party.. haha <br />KIENE LUST- my favorite, the base sounding kindof aqua in the begining, gets replaced with powerfull industrial guitar sounds.. (i love this song, also maskau) <br />LOS- all acoustic, a good song still, but not good if your looking for suicide music <br />AMERIKA- pretty much these potheads getting mad at america because 1/4 the brand names in the world are american made, and so they all say we're all livinging in amerika <br />MASKAU- even though i cant understand the words till i think it through its a depressign song, all he's doing is arguing w./ a russian lady, he calls moscow a prostitute she fights back.. its a good song (my freinds favorite) <br />MORGENSTERN- a song about a morning start *the definition of morgenstern is morning star*, he again hates it and says it makes you ugly [girfreind or w/e] <br />STIEN UM STEIN- reminds me of saving private ryan.. enough sed.. <br />OHNE DICH- really good softer rock, with an orchestra in the begining, best to play wen you find out your father is a woman.. *sniffle* (ohne dich means all alone) <br />AMOUR- really hard to listen to, it has no meaning, it is just saying everything they missed in the rest of the cd <br />ALL IN ALL I FEAL THE LEAD SINGER SUFFERS FROM CHRONIC SKITZO BUT STILL I LOVE THE BAND... AND I FEAL THAT EVEN THOUGH HALF THE SONGS ARE VERY DEROGATORY (IF YOU NO GERMAN LIKE ME) BUT STILL ITS A BEAUTIFUL CD.. BUY IT.. ITS GOOD
B0006399FS|2.0|I don't understand how anyone could say that this latest effort by U2 is energetic!  I hate to have to say it, but I'm very disappointed.  The songs are slow, Bono's voice sounds strained on several tracks, the lyrics are so-so and the music lacking. It's a real letdown to be sure!
B00068IOWC|5.0|I appreciated the return to form that U2 accomplished with \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" in 2000 but was never able to fully embrace the album. Certain songs were excellent, but others grew tired--even grating--over time (and I'm not simply speaking of the overplay of \\"Beautiful Day\\"). <br /> <br />But with \\"Bomb\\", U2 has come full circle to create a classic that will stand alongside Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The production is spot-on perfect (not too much, not too little); the hooks in several tracks are some of the most memorable that U2 has crafted; and the lyricism is excellent throughout much of the album. (Strangely, the closing hymn \\"Yahweh\\" seems the most lyrically flat song on the disc.) <br /> <br />Musically, some have suggested the disc is too quiet; but that seems a groundless complaint. Surely they haven't turned up their stereo for the thunderous blues of \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" or the riff-laden rock of \\"All Because of You\\". Even the glorious \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and the admonishing \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" will play well in arenas. <br /> <br />U2's musicianship is as good as its been since Achtung, perhaps, and that may have to do with the fact that it is allowed to stand on its own, without some of the overwrought production of their last few studio albums, \\"All That You Can't\\" included. The Edge is in full form and (fortunately) up in the mix, and Larry and Adam provide a driving urgency to a number of tracks. The album is tight and well-paced and charts a full emotional arc, working well as a complete album, even though it's literally bursting with potential singles. Expect to hear a lot of this disc in the coming months. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most remarkable thing is that a band of forty-somethings can produce something that is more urgent, timely, enthusiastic and fresh than the vast majority of young bands. You'd think U2 would have nothing left to say, or at the very least, would be sick of saying it. Their urgency and optimism is palpable and contagious; and the emotional high is invigorating. <br />
B0002EXH5O|5.0|\\"Hangar 18\\" is NOT poppish at all, and is possibly their best song!!! For thinking Classic Rock and Death Metal suck, you are [...]! Also KIMBABIG thru Youthanasia are NOT demos [...]
B00006LI4S|5.0|Its good to see Gilmour being showcased here at his old mucker Robert Wyatts Meltdown. Ive always leaned more towards Waters in the old Floyd debate and ive never really liked Gilmours version of the Floyd. But hearing songs like High Hopes without all the sheen and production and lazers has made me appreciate Gilmour a lot more as a song writer. After watching this ive found myself really enjoying The Division Bell. The only thing i find slightly annoying is the way that he often speaks the last word in one of the song lines instead of singing it. Only a minor quibble though, i love the choice of songs too some vintage Floyd tracks like Fat Old Sun and Syd Barretts Terrapin (what a great song). Richard Wright also makes an appearance with a rather bonkers song. Not forgetting of course Gilmours great guitar playing and some great musicians including Michael Kamen, Robert Wyatt and Bob Geldof (i thought he always hated Pink Floyd). <br />Anyway I write this as if my oppinion really matters but I'd recommend it.
B000002KYR|5.0|Irespective of what anyone says, this is the ZZ Top album to go for. If it was'nt for this one I might have never shown interest in the band. <br /> <br />This is the first album where extra effort had been made to package the songs, thus reducing the appeal to purists. But for music lovers like me it made the songs  better and more appealing. <br /> <br />The thunduring bass and chug a lug drums are the backbone of the album with songs like 'Sharp Dressed Man', 'Gimme all your loving' and 'I've got the six'.  <br /> <br />My favs on the album are the slower numbers where the atmosphere is created by Billy Gibbons bluesy guitarwork. Both 'Got me under pressure' and 'I need you tonight' are far better works than the ones above as these two can sustain overplay lot better than the MTV oriented songs mentioned in the begining or 'legs'. <br /> <br />All in all a great album with no fillers except maybe the last song. <br /> <br />This a great album to start if you want to get introduced to ZZ Top. The band also has other great earlier albums but they are an acquired taste.
B0006399FS|4.0|I've been a U2 fan for 20 years.  This is one of those albums that has taken me a few listens (upon first listen I was very disappointed that it wasn't all rocking like \\"Vertigo\\"), and some songs on this one are still not striking me as very unique or quite stellar in the oeuvre, but overall, I think the album strikes a definite mood and the lyrics, as usual, are wonderful.   <br /> <br />Some people call Bono a self-righteous egomaniac--well, I love that he's not afraid to be a philosopher, struggle with his own humanity and his striving for a passionate, consistent, if not perfect, faith, and share those journeys with us.  When I listen to this or \\"ATYCLB\\" I feel like I'm reading the Psalms, and that, depending on my mood, can be a great thing.  Some people don't like any hints of religion in their music--fine, but I personally don't understand why spirituality in music is frightening to some people, and I particularly have never thought Bono is preachy.  He struggles like everyone else, stands up for what he believes, and often prays through his songs.  Praying is not preaching. <br /> <br />The music takes you to a particular place.  This one is very calming and introspective.  If you are looking for flat-out passion and anger, pop in \\"War.\\"  If you are looking for something to soothe the soul and give you some great rock songs in the midst, put in \\"ATYCLB\\" or this.  (And neither one is all \\"soft\\"--there's \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" on this album and \\"New York\\" on \\"ATYCLB.\\")  I didn't like \\"ATYCLB\\" or this one at first; I felt a bit like the band had gone squishy ala Elton John.  But over time my opinion has changed.  Different U2 albums give you different things.  The band are at a different stage in their lives than they were when \\"War\\" or the \\"Joshua Tree\\" were made.  If today's U2 isn't what you're looking for, that's a bummer for you.  But it doesn't necessarily mean the albums themselves are crap. <br /> <br />My verdict: good album, getting better the moreI listen.  The standouts for me are \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"Love and Peace or Else,\\" \\"All Because of You,\\" \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" \\"One Step Closer,\\" and \\"Original of the Species.\\"  \\"Fast Cars\\" is good too, but it's not on the CD-only release. <br /> <br />PS--Pearl Jam's lion: U2 was on the cover of Time in 1987.  And you need to learn to use an apostrophe.
B00063MBU8|1.0|To that one gy, how can you call this the album of the year? For the REAL best cd of 2004, buy \\"The System Had Failed\\" by Megadeth. Now on to the album, it sucks. Simple Plan sucks in general!!! For REAL punk listen to, Black Flag, The Ramones, MC5, The Velvet Underground, The Stooges, The Misfits, Pennywise, etc.
B00067BBQE|2.0|I too, was eager to get this DVD\CD package upon release. After watching the concert, I have to agree with the lower rated reviews. The reference to A.D.D. is spot on, there must be 45-50 camera edits per minute of the show. I have well over 100 concert dvds and video tapes, this is the worst visually. Film footage and edits are flying by at breakneck speed, this is a HUGE distraction. For example - in one brief moment of the concert, the camera zooms in way too close on one of the guitarists, bumps to a crowd shot, then goes out of focus on Amy (all within about two and a half seconds). You can never really see what is going on during the entire performance. I personally, like to see a band play when watching a DVD concert; this is more like trying to stare at a medium speed strobe light through my TV.  <br /> <br />I must say that the bonus material featuring all four music videos and the live audio cd still make this package worthwhile. Evanescence are a great band to see live, so why mutilate their show on this DVD? Anywhere But Home misses the opportunity to showcase an Evanescence concert to those who have not seen the band live. Whoever directed \ edited this concert was clearly on speed, overcaffeinated, under qualified, from MTV, or all of the above.   <br />VERY DISAPPOINTING. <br /> <br />P.S. I still don't understand why people give five star ratings of this DVD before it's released or viewed??? <br />
B0002TT0NW|2.0|The previews to this film made it seem like another great film, It's really not. Whoever made this film obviously did not respect JK Rowlings inspiration, writings, or anything for that matter. To start with the writer or director or whoever added things to this film which werent in the book. Theres an annoying black in and black out between sceens sort of like in old films, that got real old. The packaging is different and does not match the other two much better films in the set. The new Dumbledor is seriously lacking, it's a shame the first actor passed away. Where were the robes???? In The books, wizards and witches didnt wear muggle clothes, especially in their world, but in this film they all have on every day normal muggle clothing even when runningaround school, I hardly saw robs at all except in a few scenes. The few good things about this film include an excelent Dementor design, good charecter casting for Professor Lupin, Professor Trelawnny was wonderfull, and Hermoine's time turner was beautifully designed. Its a shame that a new director is doing these films, I hope he doesnt do the next one.
B000002UAX|5.0|If you are reading this, then you must likely not own this album. First things first: smack yourself over the head, and pull out your credit card and order this masterpiece of aural pleasure. Quite possibly the best album of all time and you don't own it. John, Paul, George, and Ringo all stand out over the course of these two discs and each one shines. This is definitely my favorite Beatles album and not a song on there disappoints. It is a standard other artists must hold there albums to. Do yourself a favor and own this piece of history.
B0006399FS|1.0|Vertigo is a smash single...and a fantastic video.  I've been buying U2 records almost from the beginning, so I thought that just maybe \\"Vertigo\\" was a hint of a great CD...I wanted this to be GREAT!!  I really did!  I recently purchased the \\"Live Aid\\" DVD...and I remember sitting in my living room watching their blistering performance back then and I knew that I was witnessing something very special.  So, I rushed out and picked up this long awaited CD (as I have purchased every CD since then hoping to find what I saw in those incredible performances). Unfortunately, I find myself asking, AGAIN, why I didn't wait a while.  A plodding, boring, offering...I am really disappointed.  I have to say, that for me, at some point a way back, after the great \\"War\\" and \\"The Unforgettable Fire,\\" and \\"Rattle and Hum,\\" U2 became a band whose hallmark seemed to be, \\"I'm Bono.  Welcome to my world.\\" Arrogance has replaced creativity, and it seems that only this shadow remains.  I know there is an impassioned band in there somewhere, but for the life of me, it has not emerged in a long, long time.
B0000004V2|5.0|I fell in love with \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\" on the radio, long ago. It was only recently that I thought about what else the Stone Roses may have put out... another case of \\"I waited too long!\\" I read reviews on Amazon, and decided to buy the first album, rather than the \\"Complete Stone Roses.\\" I am SO glad I did. This album is pretty much perfect. I can listen to it straight through and have quickly learned the lyrics to almost every song. I believe I'll be adding this album to my \\"Top 5\\" list. I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking to hear something with more depth and passion than the majority of the crap that's being played on the radio right now.
B000669GAI|3.0|This greatest hits collection is merely Ten and Vs. pasted together with a few misc. hits thrown in. If you are thinking about purchasing this album think about shelling out the extra couple dollars for the two albums the mass majority of content came from. If you must own this record, you aren't being cheated by any means. Every song on it is great, all instant classics, with the exception of Last Kiss, which i personally detest, but to each his own. Either way i'd advise purchasing Ten & Vs. but you aren't being robbed over this greatest hits from one of Seattle's greatest.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I received mine today and I think it is exceptional value for money and very well presented.  You get 5 disks (4 cds and 1 dvd) that covers his career from the beginning with Motown in the Jackson Five, then some songs with the Jacksons and then on to his solo career and quite a lot of previously unreleased songs too.  The DVD covers 16 tracks from the Dangerous Tour in Bucharest. <br />All in all this is, in my opionion, well worth the money, but probably only for big Michael Jackson fans.. <br />Keep up the music MJ!!
B0006399FS|5.0|THE one colossal slip-up U2 have unashamingly put themselves through was hyping this album into oblivion. First Bono claims he feels (bad pun) 'this is our best album' and 'threatened by upcoming bands', so basically EVERYONE go buy my new album. Apple then endorse U2 releasing iPod's with HTDAAB's cover on the front. Then they change release dates in fear of other bands. Then Vertigo is played on EVERY radio EVERYWHERE. Then when released U2 suddenly have a larger fanbase accidently consisting of schizo music fans who actually prefer thrash metal or rap.<br /><br />I say this because I've read the reviews here. Some claim that U2 are or have become 'too soft' or 'a bunch of 40 year olds making rubbish mellow music'. Mmmm...well, firstly U2 have never been hard rock and have always produced soft, mellow songs (With Or Without You, Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, Sweetest Thing etc). Secondly U2 have not changed in terms of style, HTDAAB still contains the classic U2 rock/soft/pop style, and pull it off in success.<br /><br />This is no Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby, it is though a great album, and a contender for best of the year. Please do not listen to the fake people giving 1 stars whining U2 are too soft or too boring, hype has become the downfall of U2. Rest assured without all the hype HTDAAB would have a much higher average.
B00066N8JS|5.0|NIN in 5.1 is the best thing you could ever do for your ears. If you don't have 5.1 purchase it for this. If you don't have an SACD player purchase it for this, and if you have both, purchase this. Trent Reznor is a genius in the studio, and a 5.1 remix of this album is the best news i've heard all year. nothing short of astounding.
B00068IOWM|1.0|My big complaint here is that Universal and U2 have released this collector's edition under the pretense that it contains more than what you'd get if you ordered the deluxe version with DVD or the regular album.  What is not mentioned is that while the Collector's Edition does contain a few photos, poetry, and documents, as well as the DVD and a bonus track (Fast Cars), there are NO LYRICS and NO PICTURES that are available on the regular album or deluxe version.  When I spend $40 +, I better darn well get the lyrics and whatever the regular album contains.  Instead, I've had to buy the regular album to get the pictures of the band and lyrics, which is a basic requisite for any U2 album.  Shame on U2 and Universal for doing that to hardcore fans!  I have always been against downloading without intent to purchase albums, but now I don't care what others do to U2;  the world's biggest band is shafting its fans or doesn't care to protect us from Universal's greed.
B0006399FS|5.0|Please listen to this song for a week and then put in a review.  I am a pretty big U-2 fan and I still couldn't get into this album until I heard it like 20 times straight through.  So how do all these people expect to? This is a traditional U-2 grower, which is the best news I've heard it awhile.  All their best albums are growers.  I downloaded the leak so I've had to fall into the songs and then fall in love with them.  Don't worry Amazon, I just ordered a copy from you guys :) <br /> <br />MY FAVORITES: Crumbs, Sometimes, A Man&Woman, Vertigo, City of Blinding Lights. <br /> <br />People think that u2 have to change the course of history with every one of their releases.  They just made a great album, it wont change the world.  I was expecting a harder sounding album like others and was dissapointed at first when I heard this.  But keep listening, everyone, its pure beauty!! Thanks. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I loved Green Day when I first heard them in a confused adolesence frame of mind. Since then everything i've heard by them has been less than mediocre. Not Blink 182 bad, but not Dead Kennedy's good. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a punk album by any means, but one of the best straight ahead rock records released this year. I wanted to hate the album when i heard about it, then we played it at work, and i was converted. The new album is an astounding piece of sonic art that all should purchase, no matter what your preference is, you will love this album.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|There have been many movies, television shows, and books about time travel.  From the \\"Back to the Future\\" saga to \\"Doctor Who\\" to Michael Crichton's novel, \\"Timeline,\\" they've run the gamut on quality, story, and overall enjoyability.  None of them, however, can match the brilliance of the original \\"Time Machine\\" book written by H.G. Wells.  The original film based on that book does quite well also.<br /><br />With that in mind, I didn't expect much from this remake starring Guy Pearce.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Though it lacks the appeal of the old Rod Taylor version of the time traveller, there is something captivating about this film.  It has the whiz-bang special effects that have become commonplace these days.  The story moves at a hearty pace that doesn't give you much time to breath.  Orlando Jones is splendid as a holographic librarian who accesses information for Pearce.  Samantha Mumba does a good job as well.  Pearce is good, especially considering that this film lacks the substance that the original book contained.  The only person who didn't fit in this film was Jeremy Irons.  He is a fine actor, and his performance is nice, but his character just doesn't work in this movie.  It slows down the pace a little as well.<br /><br />The Morlocks are hideous looking creatures, and are quite something to see.  The way that they come out of and return to the ground looks a little shaky, but if suffices.<br /><br />I recommend this one to sci-fi buffs who like a little more thought put into their movies.  Yes, there is the token fight scenes and CGI glory, but this movie is based on a book that was written well beyond its years, and that is still evident in this version of \\"The Time Machine.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|Elvis, The Beatles, The Stones and U2 who are the last of the \\"OLD SCHOOL\\" traditional style of Rock and Roll artists / bands that have been able to survive / progress into this century. I'll take a moment to say that Rock is not dead. This CD will stand the test of time.
B0006399FS|3.0|Wow.  I have read just about every review on this site with just about every opinion possible.  As usual there are elements of truth in all of the reviews.  I'll address two points of interest along with my 2 cents and end with a conclusion. <br /> <br />1.  Differences in sound:  Reviewers have likened this album's sound to almost every different album in their repertoire.  So does it sound like POP?  Does it sound like ATYCLB?  Does it sound like Joshua Tree?  I haven't come to a conclusion as of yet.  It's more akin to ATYCLB... yet different.  A band that has continued to be relevant with an ever increasing fan base relies upon new, different sounds and with that comes the inevitable disapproval of those who like one sound but not another. <br /> <br />2.  Relevance:  There are a lot of you that question U2's relevance in their 3rd decade of existence.  Many say they are only playing it safe; putting out an easy, uncreative work.  Others say that Bono's inspiration has dried up and his lyrical content doesn't make sense.  Here's my take:  How many of you completely understood, embraced, and hailed Achtung Baby as one of their signature works the day after you first heard it?  I enjoyed Achtung Baby as soon as I heard it BUT the total understanding and enjoyment increased with age.  Again, give it some time.  Also as a disillusioned music fan who has turned his back on today's no-talent, corporation-driven, assembled, pop music combined with its adoption and incorporation of the hip-hop rhythm, culture, and 'music,' it's refreshing to wrap one's head around a piece of work from a time-tested group that has not and never will change its core.  When the 'music' of choice for the majority of Americans is the incoherent, ramblings of thugs and pseudo-thugs extolling the 'values' of drug-use, wonton violence, unrestrained sex, treating women as property, and blaming Bush for everything from hurricanes to bird crap on their car, it comforts me to hear from this band. <br /> <br />CONCLUSION:  When I finished listening to the album, I turned to my wife and said for the first time \\"I don't like it very much.\\"  I'm sure many of us die-hard U2 fans said the same thing.  For those of you who love this album, good.  For those of you who hate this album, give it some time.  There are plenty of U2 songs that I didn't like at first but are now staples in my daily or weekly U2 fix.  POP is an example.  About the only thing I can say is give it some time.  I really don't think this band produced a \\"crap album.\\"  I don't think Bono writes empty lyrics.  I hope, like a fine wine, it requires some aging for one's musical taste buds to enjoy the totality of its taste.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The latest entry into the \\"Potter\\" saga is one with a few changes.  First of all, Chris Columbus is not onboard as the director.  Instead, we are given Alfonso Cuaron.  He seems to have given a darker edge to the series that wasn't present in the first two films.  However, I haven't read this book yet, and that might be exactly what happens to the atmosphere at Hogwarts.  The second major change is that Harry and the rest of the kids have grown into young adults.  The final major change that is noticeable is that Michael Gambon has replaced the deceased Richard Harris as Dumbledore.  He does nothing to damage the original portrayal of the character.  In fact, he puts his own twist on the role that makes the viewer accept this new Dumbledore rather easily.  Other changes include the atmosphere and look of Hogwarts, but as with Gambon, the changes are easily accepted.<br /><br />It's nice to see all of the original cast returning from the other films.  That is a great feat these days.  As expected, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy, and the rest of the gang have aged somewhat.  Their acting skills have gotten better as well.  David Thewlis enters the fray as Professor Lupen.  He is a fine addition to the cast.  Sirius Black is played by the always enjoyable Gary Oldman.  Emma Thompson takes a wonderful, albeit freakish, turn as the divination professor.<br /><br />The story is rather engaging.  Black has escaped from Azkaban prison and is seeking out Harry in order to complete a deception he started against Harry's parents.  The story unfolds at a good pace, much better than the other films.  The plot gets rather confusing at one point for those of us who haven't read the book, but be patient, the payoff is well worth it.<br /><br />The special effects are wondrous in this film.  Harry's flying scene with Buckbeak is breathtaking, as it soaks up the countryside where the film is shot.  There are werewolves, shapeshifters, the signature floating candles in the Great Hall and, of course, those wonderful paintings throughout the school.  Dawn French is quite colorful in her brief appearance as the Fat Lady, who appears in one of the paintings and witnesses a terrible thing.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with extras.  You can tour Lupen's schoolroom, tour a candy shop, test your visual skills, and chase Scabbers.  There are a number of other games and documentaries to watch, but they are too numerous to list here.  One of the best features, in my opinion, are the interviews with the cast and crew.  It was a treat watching the youngsters from the film talk about their experiences from being a part of the movies.  It was also fun to watch the older cast, including the new additions such as Gambon, Oldman, and Thewlis.<br /><br />Overall, this film is probably a little bit too scary for some of the younger children in the audience, but I'd say that anybody over the age of six will have no problem with the scares that appear in the movie.  There are a couple of coarse words early in the film, but the language is kept at a decent level for the rest of the film.  In fact, Ron's token saying, \\"Bloody Hell,\\" is about as rough as it gets once Harry makes it to Hogwarts.  The film appeals to all ages, fulfilling the fantasies of youngsters and reminding adults that the imagination is such a wonderful thing when used properly.  I highly recommend this to families who aren't put off by the whole \\"magical\\" aspect of Harry and to those who love great, imaginative adventure., of course, those wonderful paintings throughout the school.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot Vol. 3 is amazing, it was my first Slipknot CD. now let me get my point across. <br />1.Prelude: This is really a cool song! I heard someone before say \\"it's just an opener\\", but it really does sound cool, at least the chorus does.  <br /> <br />2.Blister Exists: This kind of gets you fired up after the slow-ish opening song and it's really cool, especially that drum solo <br /> <br />3.Three Nil: I like this one too, although it doesn't nesecarily fit together great... it changes a lot. it's loud too. <br /> <br />4.Duality: Totally awesome, nothing bad about it at all. <br /> <br />5.Opium of the ppl: The effect of 4 awesome songs starts to wear off... I often forget what this song is like. It's ok just nothing amazing <br /> <br />6.Circle: I used to hate this song, but it's grown on me. Soft, acoustic, CREEPY, strange beginning and lyrics... but it's good <br /> <br />7.Welcome: A punch in the face after circle, not great but not bad. Corey has fun screaming his guts out in the chorus! <br /> <br />8.Vermillion: Really awesome! Heavier version of Part 2 but it's nice to have something louder to listen to, not acoustic. The song really starts at 2:00, it's kinda lame up until there <br /> <br />9.Pulse of the Maggots: Back to something more like Welcome, it's better than welcome, but really the same idea. Has some parts where it's a lot quieter that's kinda cool <br /> <br />10.Before I forget: Not one bad part of the song. Main part of the song is loud and sounds cool, then it builds suspense and the loud and totally awesome chorus comes in, real cool <br /> <br />11.Vermillion pt 2: Acoustic version of vermilion, I hated it at first but now I realise it's like the good part of vermilion but quieter. Real good <br /> <br />12. Nameless: Very creative, the song sounds like metal for most of the song... then the chorus is like really soft. <br />~The good part of the cd ends here~ <br />13 and 14. I don't like these songs at all, nothing like the rest ofthe CD just fillers. <br /> <br />I like the fact that this cd is not Parental Advisory, it's just nice to listen to music where people are like F---You! Very creative, a must have for most music fans. Even if you've never heard slipknot or metal for that matter, it's worth getting. <br /> <br />I'm not even a big Knot fan but I still can't imagine giving this CD less than 4 stars... it's truly a work of art for any person. Excuse my ignorance but I have 2 questions: <br /> <br />1. What other bands are \\"directly related\\" to slipknot? Korn, maybe? <br /> <br />2. If i like this album and think the debut is pretty good, would I like Iowa? <br />
B00005A46T|2.0|i am very dissapointed by this cd. it lacks what their fisrt and third cds have. the songs here just dont sound melodic. they really just sound like someone hitting a cat.  if your looking for good slipknot check out their other 2 cds
B0006399FS|2.0|U2 wanted to fit in with the new music culture.  So they embraced Apple and jumped on the downloadable tunes bandwagon. OK.  But what really distinguished U2 from their contemporaries in the eighties and nineties was the ability to craft an ALBUM of rich material.  Instead, we have a typical contemporary album where you'll like up to three songs if you're lucky. <br /> <br />Of course, maybe this CD wasn't a cruel irony after all.  Maybe Bono and company realized how shallow the album was after all and shrewdly recognized their best way to make money was to encourage people to buy singles instead of an entire album.   <br /> <br />It's sad to see U2 sink so low, but it's no wonder that the most oft-repeated word in these reviews is \\"boring.\\"  Do yourself a big favor, go to iTunes, download Vertigo if you like it...or just sample some tracks.  Take one or two that appeal to you, and cut your own CD, blanketing these songs with good rock cuts from other artists (or classic U2 tracks). <br /> <br />It's really amazing that the only dinosaur band in the past three years to make an original album with an edge is Fleetwood Mac.  This CD should have been titled \\"All That You CAN Leave Behind\\" -- in fact, rather easily.
B00005JMXX|2.0|This movie is MAD ridiculous!  Sure, the special effects aren't bad...but, the movie is so awful, you forget they're even there anyway.  It's a shame, too - the environmental message could have been good, but is lost in scientific impossibilities.  What am I talking about? <br />1) There is no way multiple \\"superstorms\\" and a polar ice-cap meltdown could happen in a matter of days. <br />2) The statue of liberty would not survive a massive tidal wave. <br />3) You wouldn't find arctic wolves in Manhattan three days after the \\"Ice Age\\" set in. <br />4) The New York City Public Library woud likely not protect you from an immediate drop in temperature of 200 degrees or so. <br />5) It would probably take many, MANY months of book burning (to keep warm) at the New York City Public Library before you would have to even consider burning the Gutenberg Bible. <br />6) With current Global Positioning Systems, it would be highly unlikely that an oil tanker would cruise up 5TH Avenue even if all ground-based communications were lost. <br />7) Blah, blah BLAH, blah BLAH...this movie is so ridiculous, I'm tired of pointing out its ridiculousness.   <br />I can't wait to throw this DVD in the trash and watch something more believable...like \\"Independence Day,\\" or one of the \\"Ernest\\" movies. <br />Final thought - just a silly quote from the movie: \\"Mankind survived the last ice age, we're certainly capable of surviving this one.  It all depends on whether or not we're willing to learn from our mistakes.  I'm sure willing to learn from mine.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm shocked by the uneven reviews of this CD. To my ears, it vies for Album of the Year. <br /> <br />How to Dismantle and Atomic Bomb is extremely well made, with one hell of a lead-off song. <br /> <br />The rest of the album doesn't rock? Well, who says everything in life has to rock with the same fervor? Passion isn't always loud. In fact, it's often most powerful when it's quietly rendered. <br /> <br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is only one of about four U2 albums I've purchased over the past 25 years, the others being Under a Blood Red Sky, The Joshua Tree, War and All That You Can't Leave Behind. Frankly, I've only been a marginal U2 fan since their inception -- which I was fortunate enough to be around to see and hear. <br /> <br />Occasionally, I'd notice what they were up to. But I never got into the '90s version of the band. They were so over the top that I simply tuned out. Way too shrill for my tastes. <br /> <br />What shot my interest in U2 into the stratosphere -- and caused me to buy not only the Apple Special Edition U2 iPod but also The Complete U2 -- was, simply, the energy of \\"Vertigo.\\" The TV commercial is way cool. Yes, the song rocks. The energy is palpable. Plus, their SNL appearance the other night was damn exciting. <br /> <br />So I bought How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, not really knowing what to expect. <br /> <br />What I discovered was an album of richness and depth. Layers of texture. Variations of tempo and tone. Craftsmanship. No, it doesn't always \\"rock.\\" Yet, it doesn't have the drowsiness of the latest R.E.M. album, either. Dismantle never fails to captivate me. It's like a cross between the best parts of Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. <br /> <br />Bono has never sounded better. And U2's songs have never sounded more cohesive and well-executed. The production is stellar, too. <br /> <br />I'm still listening to Dismantle. In fact, I haven't taken it out of my iMac since 8:00 this morning. It has been the score to my work day. <br /> <br />You can find Dismantle at Best Buy for $9.99. But if you miss that sale, Amazon has it for an equally enticing $10.99. Either way, it's a small price to pay to own one of the best albums released in 2004. <br /> <br />I heartily recommend How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album definitely proves that U2 will be the last band standing. This is a true classic. None of their contemporaries come even close. If every band crafted an album at this level, the word record sales would take on a new meaning. This album is sharp and polished. It's great to watch the masters work their craft. If you want to know how to make a good rock album, then you should pick this CD up in a hurry. <br /> <br />Album Highlights: <br />Vertigo <br />Miracle Drug <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own <br />City of Blinding Lights <br />A Man and a Woman <br />Original of the Species <br />Yahweh <br />
B00000AFWZ|4.0|There's a lot of great tunes included in this boxset in fact I didn't hear hardly any I didn't like, so the song selection is no problem for me. Where the producers of this set (namely Bill Inglot) and I part company is in the presentation. Did I have too much too dream last night or where nearly all the songs on this set in Mono? Now I realise that the majority of people that will buy this set grew up in the 60's listening to this stuff on AM radio and that's very nice, but myself (and I'm sure many others too) will not be listening to these CD's through an AM radio set but rather a couple of thousand dollars worth of STEREO equipment. Thankfully I have many of the tunes on this set on other CD's in their true stereo form. What's really ironic is that it was the psychedelic era that really took advantage of stereo recording in the studio. Some of those Hendrix tracks just wouldn't be the same in mono. <br /> <br />So while I sort of see why they did it I don't agree with it. They should of just presented them all in stereo where possible and those who want to hear them the old way can just flip the switch on their amp to mono.
B00063MBU8|5.0|For everyone that wants a cd that relates to a teenager, buy this right away! I can be upset about something and songs like jump and shut up just help me through. They are way better than Good Charlotte, you cant even compare the two of them. Who wants to hear a band that went from singing about boys and girls to screaming in the middle of a song? Simple Plan has great songs to sing at the top of your lungs and not care who hears. I can listen to it over and over and over again. I'm so happy that there is band that really cares about its fans through its lyrics, also dont forget to buy the yellowcard cd...if you like simple plan you will love yellowcard!!
B0006399FS|5.0|What makes this album stellar is not the Edge's gee-whiz guitar tricks, Bono's whail or Adam and Larry's locked-in grooves (all of those things are here of course).  This album's greatest strength is it raw, naked, and bold emotion expressed in the sentiment of the lyrics and the directness of the music.  Probably the most straight-up emotional album since the Joshua Tree (and that's saying something considering emotion is a major ingredient in every U2 album).    The rundown:    Veritgo - You know it, you love it...it rocks. 9/10    Miracle Drug - A slower song, passionate, interesting subject matter. 7/10    Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own - This album's \\"One\\". Gorgeous. 10/10    Love and Peace or Else - A dark, spacy rocker. Has an Achtung vibe. 8/10    City of Blinding Lights - very uptempo, joyous song. Coldplay should be jealous. 9/10    All Because of You - Sassy! It's like a Stones song! 8/10    A Man and a Woman - This one is a grower. lower-key track but very sexy and has romantic-tension undertones. nice, huh? 8/10    Crumbs From Your Table - great song that has a momementum that is continuous from beginning to end. nice melodic guitar lines from Edge. 10/10    One Step Closer - Wow. A track that might not jump out at you at first because it's quiet and meditative but begins to envelope you in the mood of the lyrics. Listen to them. 10/10    Original of the Species - Touching song but not a standout track 7/10    Yahweh - A closing song more notable for Bono's incredible couplets.  The subject matter is familiar territory for Bono (the subject matter being God, of course) but the lyrics convey a sense of coming to to terms with the contradictory nature of God. 8/10    Don't bother with the detractors; they have no attention span and can't function without an instant-sugary-hook-buzz. Besides, thats what Vertigo is for! This album is great and the more time you spend with it, the more it pays off.
0689862725|1.0|This was absolutely the worst book I ever read.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Get Out! \\"Seinfeld\\" on DVD? He's already the Master of His Domain why would it need to be released it on DVD? Because the fans demanded it and justice can only be served if one of the most popular and best sitcoms can be viewed, uncut and with lots and lots of background material on this groundbreaking show. Just a warning this review is for the gift set which includes the salt shakers, playing cards and a copy of one of Larry David's scripts. That's the main difference between this gift set (that and the fact that it includes the two boxed sets including the first three \\"seasons\\"). The first season consisted of five episodes (including the pilot)while the second consisted of 13 episodes as the network decided to commit to the show when the show received solid ratings. The third season consists of 22 episodes. All the episodes are the uncut original episodes that aired on NBC (most of the episodes in syndication are usually trimmed by a minute or two). The boxed set has a slipover case. Inside the inside slipcase each disc is nicely housed in individual slim DVD holders. 15 commentary tracks (if I'm counting correctly)for both sets. Deleted scenes, unused stand up bits, promos, featurettes make this a generous set particulary when compared to the bare bones releases for other similar (although not as funny) series.<br /><br />When \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\" (the original title) first aired as a limited series no one suspected it would be the next big thing. Seinfeld and his collaborator/co-creator/co-producer and frequent co-writer Larry David pushed TV comedy to its boundaries and then demolished them. They'd then establish new boundaries and demolish those. That's groundbreaking, important television. It's also what made \\"Seinfeld\\" unique. Sure, \\"Who's The Boss?\\" could be funny but it had to be about something where someone learned something in every episode. Seinfeld's and David's mantra \\"learn nothing and be about nothing\\" proved that TV touching on the absurdity of real life could be funnier than TV where the characters learned valuable lessons and became better people. In truth, that rarely happens in the real world and the fact that Seinfeld made fun of and played with that convention made it important. It helped that it was damn funny as well.<br /><br />An exceptionally sharp looking high definition transfer makes this one of the best looking transfer I've seen in awhile. The pilot episode doesn't look quite as sharp. It's clear that it's drawn from a second generation videotaped master. The colors bleed a bit but and the image isn't quite as sharp as the rest of the series.<br /><br />The hour long documentary has interesting, revealing tidbits including a shocker from Julia Louis- Dreyfus-she never saw the original pilot episode. In fact, she didn't see it until she prepped for the commentary tracks and interview for this boxed set. Larry David's acerbic dry fatalistic sense of humor (which informs his terrific show \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" on HBO) along with the witty, informed but ultimately wacky observations of the rest of the cast and crew make this a marvelous documentary. Unlike the featurettes or documentaries on a lot of TV shows (any of the \\"Sex and the City\\" ones for example), to invert a famous quip by a famous writer, \\"there's there there\\". Substance for a show about nothing what an ironic twist but in reality \\"Senfield\\" was about something. It was about the absurd little moments that populate our lives but a little more twisted.<br /><br />We also get a trivia filled \\"Notes About Nothing\\" that can be viewed while watching the various episodes. Sometimes it's about...well nothing but most of the time there's fascinating bits of trivia in this text commentary. \\"In the Vault\\" includes deleted scenes from season 1 & 2. Finally, we get commentaries from Jerry, Larry David, writer Larry Charles and Jason, Julia & Michael on 6 classic episodes. There's also two versions of the pilot with interesting differencesincluded (not the least of which is the weak opening music which doesn't compare to the final theme).<br /><br />So...yada, yada yada buy this today....yada, yada, yada.h interesting differences included (not the least of which is the weak opening music which doesn't compare to the final theme).  <br /> <br />So...yada, yada yada buy this today....yada, yada, yada. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|It's interesting how much controversy this album has generated. I've never seen U2 fans so divided. It seems like there is no middle ground. Either people give this album 5 stars or 1 star. Good or bad, U2 has obviously accomplished something. I think the fans of U2's material from the nineties are disappointed because this is not as adventurous or innovative an album as say Zooropa or Pop. They expected the band to continue going in a new direction. Some of the eighties fans are disappointed because it is not a return to form as they had anticipated. I'm a fan of both the eighties U2 and the nineties U2 so I cannot relate to either camp. I'm trying to analyze this album objectively and judge it based on its own merit. I'm not going to critique this album based on a preconceived notion of what I thought it should sound like. I'm also not going to compare it to previous U2 musical incarnations. Lets just look at this album for what it is. To say that this album is slow paced is ludicrous. Several tracks on this album truly rock such as All Because of You and Vertigo. Both tracks explode with crunching guitars. There's also some very moving tracks on this album such as Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, which is a song about Bono's relationship with his father. If you aren't moved by this song then you aren't human and you should consider returning to your home planet. Miracle Drug is the most beautiful song on the album. This track combines emotional lyrics with sonic guitar licks and a pulse pounding chorus. Simply stated, it combines all the necessary ingredients that make up a great U2 song. There are a few tracks such as City of Blinding Lights where Bono's impassioned vocals really stand out, but when all is said and done, this is definitely an Edge dominated album, at least in a musical sense. The Edge's familiar guitar sound, which can only be described as angelic, dominates the atmosphere of every track on this album. Even though Bono is the most recognizable member of the band, it is the Edge who provided U2 with its signature sound, which launched the band into rock's elite. This album is yet another great addition to the U2 canon. Despite the title, this is not a political album, but it sure has stirred a lot of debate. People are casting their votes as to whether How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is a good album or not. Right now the U2 nation is divided. I think that by the end of the campaign (tour), we will all agree that this latest U2 candidate is a winner.
0393035158|3.0|As an atheist and a rationalist, I was happy to see the success of this book.  However, as I read it I became more and more frustrated.  The knock against religion for its violence is an old and cliche one, made before by James Haught, Karen Armstrong, Mark Juergensmeyer, and many others.  The long chapter on Islam is overdone and makes it look like it is worse than other monotheistic religions, while the real difference is the OTHER aspects of culture that dilute the intolerance and destructiveness of, for example, Christianity.  Without Enlightenment European culture Christianity would be just as bad--and was. <br />The last few chapters, about morality and spirituality, totally run off the rails.  They show that Harris does not really know what reason is, nor what evidence is, nor what relativism is.  He is either short-sighted or completely wrong about his entire discussion on these subjects.  Logic and reason are not \\"intuitive\\" at all, spirituality/mysticism is not rational (if it were, all mystics would arrive at the same conclusions--see John Horgan's \\"Rational Mysticism\\"), and morality is both more and less than happiness.  Christians are happy that the world will end in an apocalypse, and \\"moral values\\" voters are happy to deprive others of their rights.  The last few chapters should be chopped off the book. <br />A much better book on belief, reason, and atheism is \\"Natural Atheism\\" (visit [...] which not only defines and explains reason, but also discusses the social and historical circumstances of toleration, church/state separation, science, and atheist activism much better and more consistently.  It also explains what relativism really is and why there is no such thing as a \\"rational belief\\" or a \\"rational religion.\\"  It, finally, settles the debates about spirituality, agnosticism, and belief vs. knowledge.
0783230079|5.0|I can't remember when I first saw this movie, but I absolutely loved it from the moment I did.  I recall that just left the city (San Francisco) and the fact that this movie takes place there had that going for it from the start.<br /><br />The second was Robert Downey, Jr.  Say what you will, he's always been one of my favorite actors and he is immensely talented.  Troubled, certainly, but judge not, etc.  I don't particularly want to become mired in the personal lives of Hollywood actors anyway, good, bad or indifferent.<br /><br />This movie has fantastic additional actors in it as well.  Charles Grodin, Tom Sizemore (another troubled one) and Elisabeth Shue.  The prinicple of the movie is that these four people are accidentally killed in a bus crash (5 including the bus driver) and they then get connected - ghost/spirit wise - to a baby being born at that instant (Robert Downey, Jr.).  They follow them through his life, only learning very late in the game what they are there for.  I won't go into too much, and I haven't read if any of the other 29 reviewers already gave it away.  But, I won't.<br /><br />This movie really does have it all.  Humor, sadness, touching emotion.  I mean, it's truly a beautiful and moving film that has never failed to please anyone I have shown it to.  I'm certain, if you haven't seen it, it will have the same effect on you.  I am just so thankful it is now FINALLY on dvd as I have been playing and playing my VHS copy for years - it was the only copy I had.  Definitely get this before it goes out of print.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I'll try to keep it short: This album is NOT for everyone. I was introduced to Radiohead through this and I wish I hadn't have been. I popped it in and I HATED it. I listened to Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors, and I fought with the idea that Radiohead was not going to be one of my favorite bands. Believe me, I tried and tried and tried but couldn't like it. But then I listened to Morning Bell and Pyramid Song for the thousandth time and I loved it. Morning Bell is beautiful and Pyramid Song is an enthralling piano number. Dollard and Cents is a great bluesy song, and hey, I got to liking PPRD! NowI listen to it all the time because it is so good. But then I got The Bends and liked it way better. I still highly recommend Amnesiac if you have the patience. Believe me, you will LOVE it, but DON'T start with this album. Build up to it in this order: <br /> <br />THE BENDS <br />OK COMPUTER <br />KID A <br />THEN buy AMNESIAC or HAIL TO THE THIEF <br />PABLO HONEY <br />EPs and LIVE RECORDINGS <br /> <br />PS. Sorry I din't keep it short.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|This \\"army\\" of artists, for us living in South America, is really awesome, I cannot explain what I felt during so many hours watching and listening to this 4 discs. But, as I said in the title, in the booklet inside the DVD there's a mistake when listing artists and songs in discs 3 and 4, they repeated discs 1 and 2, at least in the copy I got in Buenos Aires.
B000068TPN|5.0|After reading many of the negative reviews complaining that this movie was not a political crusade and did not make the veterans out to be criminals or druggies, I had to write this review. <br /> <br />This film is based on the book, \\"We Were Soldiers Once...And Young\\" by then Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore and reporter Joe Galloway.  The book is about the first major battle in the Vietnam war in November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam.  Colonel Moore, commanded a battalion of troops who were sent to \\"find the enemy.\\"  Little did they know that they were dropped into the middle of a base camp for an entire Vietnamese Army Division. At the end of the battle, Moore's men won the battle despite the fact that they were ridiculously outnumbered. <br /> <br />Through their own memories and extensive research and interviews with those who fought there, Moore and Galloway were able to tell the story of the entire battle as seen through the eyes of soldiers, including the commander of the Vietnamese troops. <br /> <br />This film is true to the book and tells the story of the men who fought bravely and died on LZ X-Ray. The director, Randall Wallace said that he set out to make the movie true to the battle after reading that Colonel Moore said that \\"Hollywood had gotten the story of the Vietnam soldier wrong every damned time.\\"   <br /> <br />If you are looking for a pure action movie, this is not for you.  If you are looking for an ideologic, political movie a la Platoon or Apocalypse Now, this is not your movie. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson plays Colonel Moore with much gusto and is very believable as a Lt. Colonel.  Sam Elliott's portrayal of Command Sergeant Major Plumley brought back memories of CSM's and 1st sergeants I knew in my military service. Greg Kinnear as Bruce Crandall, a brave helicopter pilot that kept the wounded moving, the reinforcements and supplies coming.  Barry Pepper rounds out the top four of the cast in a memorable performance as reporter Joe Galloway.  Others  in this movie are Madeleine Stowe, Chris Klein of American Pie fame, Keri Russell (Felicity)and Ryan Hurst (Saving Private Ryan, Remember the Titans). <br /> <br />The pace of the movie is very good, beginning with a quick introduction about the Vietnam War.  Showing the troops getting ready to leave their families and the pain their loved ones feel when they do leave.  It then drops us into the middle of battle with cinematography on par with Saving Private Ryan. It is during this time and during the aftermath that we see the incredible bravery and selfless sacrifice on both sides that day. It brought tears to my eyes watching the battle, knowing that this movie was a true account of one of the battles of Vietnam.  The movie also cuts back to the homefront, where the wives eagerly await the return of their husbands and dread the receipt of news that they have become a widow. <br /> <br />Being a veteran of our U.S. Army, maybe I am more sentimental to movies of this nature than non-veterans.  I have seen more war movies than I can remember.  I'll say this...never have I been more moved or more touched or more proud after watching a movie about the brave men of our military.  I am not ashamed to say that I wept during this film.  The portrayal of the battle and the camaraderie of men during battle is dead on and moved me to tears.  The carnage of the war and the dead and dying was hard to watch.  I was very touched that this movie showed the war back home, which has not happened in any film that I can remember.  This movie portrayed the anxiety and fear of the soldiers' wives, who awaited their return and feared every day that they would become widows. <br /> <br />If you want and ideological spin on the Vietnam war made by people who won't stop talking about its failures, rent Platoon or another movie.  If you want to watch a tribute to thos soldiers, and see true heroism and the sacrifice that our soldiers made back then and continue to make today, watch this movie.   <br /> <br />\\"Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|This is the best U2 I've ever heard.<br /><br />I honestly have felt this group has left a legacy of one song albums that, as a whole, exposed a rather lacking and tremendously overrated body of work.  (I was bored silly by their little boy in a helmet best of collection)  I don't even know where my Joshua Tree is.  The album of theirs I listened to most was POP.  All That You Can't Leave Behind has been completely left behind in my CD stack and I have never once felt a strong enough compulsion to dig it up like I just did the Kink's To The Bone.<br /><br />In many respects this is U2's \\"Best Of\\" CD.  Not since the early days has a producer let the Edge's guitar resonate so satisfyingly in and out of each tune.<br /><br />It's funny to read all the criticism of Bono.  His voice is strained and lacking and over-dramatically deliberate, just like it's always been.  His lyrics, as always, sound like a Hippa-Christian on a Soho street corner in 1968(Love will take us to the mountain, lalalala, jump! Jump with me! Jump, Ju-no, no, just spiritually....kerplunk-oops)<br /><br />But when the Edge is on and his frenetic and brilliant etchings that somehow evoke desolation and awe and wonder all in the same moment permeate a U2 song, then you see who brought this band from I Will Follow all the way to Vertigo.  It makes the pompous and grotesque commercialism of them and IPODs just funny.  Yet, with a wink, Bono seems to know his place in the band-knows that his supporting members and himself, have a certain magic that won't be remembered in the middle of the road ballads that don't hold up on a Best of album, or the ridiculous attempts at hip-hop and electronica  in the lost 90's decade, but instead, long after the wind has died and the birds are quiet over the ruins of the rock and roll landscape, there on the Edge will be this manic, lilting guitar carrying us all to a higher place.
0786191465|5.0|This book has helped me through so many difficult times in my life. It is full of truths. It will cause you to question why you are here but will not give you any clues to the answer. The answers are within you
B00005JMJG|5.0|You should read other reviews for details about this movie. <br /> <br />I liked \\"Liar, Liar\\", but none of Carrey's other comedies. Then along came \\"The Truman Show\\", a really good drama. Next came \\"The Majestic\\", which was even better. Now it is \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", a truly GREAT movie, with fantastic performances by the entire cast. Jim Carrey is truly a great dramatic actor; and this is the first performance in which I liked Kate Winslet. <br /> <br />This is a complex movie; you may need to watch it twice to understand all of its nuances. But it is absolutely a GREAT movie, deserving an Oscar. <br /> <br />
B0002TT0NW|5.0|PoA has been my fav of the books and now it is my fav of teh movies also. Everyone saying the movie was to dark and had no color, you must be color blind. I saw color. A lot of it. Alfonso Cuaron should in fact direct Goblet of Fire because Harry, Ron, Hermine(coud never spell her name), and the others are growing up and so is everyone else that is watching these movies. Columbus i think made the movies so childish. Thats why i never watched the movies after teh fifth time. He just came out and told you everything. You didnt have to think and you didnt enjoy the movies. Now Cauron made you think a bit. He never told us what the dementors accually did untill near the end so the audience that didnt no was kept in suspense. If i had never the book and i had been watching the movie, i would have been dying to know what they did. And everyone complaining about the new position of hagrid's hut and the whomping willow, i did not mind because acually, when i read the books, i pictured the hut away from castle. Columbus had it near the castle. I never did like that. Now before i end this review, let me say this. I loved the movie and people reading the review that has never sean the movie and are deciding whether or not to spend the money, dont listen to anyone with a 1,2, or 3 rating star on the movie. Those are people that dont like change and wish everything in the world to be like they want it to be. Go out and buy the movie. Its only 15 dollars where i live. So it not as much as 20.
0446677450|4.0|In summary, this book teaches three concepts: <br /> <br />1.  The relationship between (net) income and assets <br />2.  Shedding the old dogmas/the need for financial literacy <br />3.  Taking risks and learning from them <br /> <br />RDPD is dead on the mark when it comes to the concept of building up your assets and letting them do the work for you.  The primary means of doing this are: <br /> <br />1.  Spending less than you make  <br />2.  Saving/investing your profits.   <br /> <br />He calls this 'the relationship between income and assets'.    <br /> <br />No matter how simple this shounds, this philosophy is largely forgotten in today's 'spend now/pay later' society.  If Americans could heed this advice alone, their financial lives would be much better off.  This concept is made elegantly in RDPD. <br /> <br />RDPD doesn't stop there.  It continues on to essentially say that in order to be really really rich, you need to look at the world with a new set eyes and use your brain (called 'financial literacy').  Financial literacy is the ability to shed the old dogmas of working hard/studying hard to get a decent paying job and look at the world with an eye to identifying opportunities. <br /> <br />The author chose real estate and (I think) private placement stock offerings.  By no means are these the only ways to make grow your income earning assets, but the author doesn't really elaborate on other areas.  I get the sad (but probably incorrect) impression that his real estate wealth came from those late night, get rich commericals/seminar programs.  This is one aspect of the book that I can't shake. <br /> <br />RDPD tells you that simply investing in the stock market in mutual funds is 'fine' and that owning your own home is actually a drain on your cash flow/net worth.  These didn't come as a terrible shock to me, but to those who thought they were on the right track, (spending less than they make, diligently saving/investing) they might be a bit turned off by these revelations. <br /> <br />However, making money is about taking risks.  Investing in mutual funds and owning a home are generally low risk/long term strategies.  To really make money by growing your assets, one needs to use their brain and take risks, which is the third message of the book.  Although I believe the author glosses over the risks, they are there, specifically his losses on the stock investments.   <br /> <br />Another thing to keep in mind is that making money still takes time.  It can't be done in one day.  Even the author notes that he had to consistently trade up properties and has had to make many stock investments (and suffered many losses) to get to where he is today (before he started selling books).  But these losses and property trade ups were treated as lessons learned to constanly fine tune his 'financial literacy', a very key part of his strategy.  <br /> <br />All in all, if Americans could learn and adhere to the first lesson of the book, they'd be much be off.  Step 3 IMO can come after people shore up their personal finances (essentially step 1).
B0006399FS|5.0|There are four great and defining U2 albums; War, Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and, yes, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.  This album has something from every era of U2 music.  And much of the songs are better than the era they resemble. <br /> <br />I have heard it said that this album sounds to much like U2.  First of all, I don't even know what that means but, if it means that they sound true to form, yes, they do.  This is an exceptional album that is not experimental, but it is full of the conviction many have been looking for.  This album breathes life into a music industry stale with self love and mediocre music.  This album actually lives up to its hype, unlike All That You Can't Leave Behind; which was a good album, but not great as the hype would have you think. <br /> <br />As a side note: The Unforgettable Fire comes very close to being the fifth on that list of great U2 ablums.  Anyways, this one is here to enjoy and enjoyment it will bring.
B00067BBQE|3.0|Let me first say I have been looking forward to getting this DVD since it was first announced a few months ago, so I ran out to Circuit City and bought it after lunch and spent the rest of the afternoon watching the videos and Concert.  What a HUGE LETDOWN.  The concert is a long music video.   They have about 15 different cameras recording the show which sounds great but the guy must have been on speed when they edited it because they change views every 1-3 seconds.  IT DROVE ME NUTS!  I got this DVD because I saw them in concert and the energy was awesome.  I love to watch Amy Lee on stage, but all you ever get are glimpses of her, and many of the angles are either zoomed all the way in so you can only see part a person on stage or so far back you feel like you are in the $20 seats.  So while I absolutely hated the video, the audio of the concert was really good.  You have a selection of either stereo or 5.1 Dolby Digital.  I ran it in Dolby Digital and it sounded great, you get a real feel for what it sounds like in concert.  The music videos are all there and they look and sound good.   <br /> <br />Overall I still like this DVD, but the crazy editing really keeps it from being one that I would wear out.
B000000W5N|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the absolute best rock n roll albums ever! The sound is so sexy, contagious and fun its simply great. Rock was meant to be like this and this is one of the Stones best albums, there is not one weak song on here, its not too short(Led It Bleed)nor too long(Exile on Main)its just right and loaded with good stuff! No gimmicks or strings attached, just pure, undistilled rock and roll! If your used to modern rock then you have no idea what the good stuff is and you need to give this a listen and discover REAL rock and roll as it was meant to be!!
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park fame have put together a fantastically funny story regarding the war on terror.  Try imagining sixteen year old boys sneaking into the movie studio when their parents aren't around.  Team America is juvenile humor on steroids.  Our heroes are out to save the world from militant Muslims and the Communist terror of Kim Jong Il---and the naive actors like Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, and Helen Hunt who stand in their way.  The terror masters manipulate the Hollywood crowd to unwittingly further their evil plans.  And no, this film is not even slightly politically correct.  Everyone may be offended.  Both the religious right and the goofy left will find things to appall them.  The vulgar language and wild sex scenes (yes Virginia, puppets do indeed enjoy sex!) will definitely get your attention.<br /><br />Team America's irreverent and insightful look at today's terrorist threat makes it well worth your time.  Ultimately, it not too subtly argues that the terrorists must be opposed by violence.  Pacifism will only render us vulnerable.  Our enemies primarily respond only to a serious booty kicking.  It's a message that needs to be heeded.  Are you too late to see Team America at your local theater?  In that case, you should purchase the dvd version.
B0006399FS|4.0|Achtung readers: I am not a music critic, I just pretend to be one for free. <br /> <br />Let me begin by saying this album was hugely promoted across the world, boasted expectations of its brilliance, and left us wondering what U2 possibly could have up their sleeves.  The time has come to face this beast and see what is made of, or should I say, what we are made of.  On the day of its release, we are left to ponder the result that is HTDAAB.  Rather, I am left to ascertain whether it truly is everything it said it would be, and much more (it is U2, so I expect this of them). I had certain ideas of what this album of songs should sound like, therefore, what it would sound like.  I think I expected something other-worldly with this record.  Not exactly Achtung Baby, but something totally new, never before seen in the history of rock and roll, that commented on the current state of the world.  And let me just say this record is nothing like this idea of mind-bending music that I had thought existed. Upon first listen, I was like \\"what?\\".  It blindsided the left side of my brain, especially my pre-conceived notions of U2 rock.  It had tried to listen to the Bomb in a linear manner, and then draw conclusions after that first listen.  Big mistake.  It may be a slightly over-produced (one of my few critiques of the album), but it is in no way safe or logical.  In no way is it an overtly political album, but it does make loud statements about the current state of one's heart, soul, and mind.  It is essentially not a literal white-flag U2 Album, but rather the white flag that should exist within one's own state of being (thus the way we are, the way we reflect upon the world and act within it).  The Joshua Tree spoke to my heart, Achtung Baby to my ego and mind, and HTDAAB speaks directly to my soul.  I know, some people reading this right now are laughing.  But I truly believe this.  When I feel something, I really feel it.  On the surface, HTDAAB seems like straightforward rock, but after a couple of listens, I knew I had something great beneath the polish of production. <br /> <br />I am not going to give this album a track by track review, because all listeners have favorites and least favorites.  There are strong tracks and less strong tracks.  There are some of the best lyrics Bono has ever penned, but also some of the cheesiest.  The guitars and rhythm section have never sounded better, but also not overly new sounding.  New sounds do not necessarily equal great stuff, however.  I am currently not skipping any song on this disc, which is unlike in the past when I have been known from time to time to skip some U2 tracks. <br /> <br />One track in particular, though, sums up my feeling for this album and where U2 are at this point in their careers, One Step Closer.  Closer to what, and how far away are they?  Only time will tell.  But, in all truth, U2 are being honest with their state of mind (does honesty = a release?) and where they are amongst the trash and glitter of the world.  They are fessing up to themselves in this complexly simple album.  They are an epic band making victorious music, but still are searching. <br /> <br />\\"Simplicity is indeed often the sign of truth and a criterion of beauty.\\" - Mahlon Hoagland (Toward the Habit of Truth) <br /> <br />9/10 or 4.25 stars  <br /> <br />
B000001DTM|5.0|This is my all time favorite U2 album, just barley over \\"The Joshua Tree\\".  U2 seems to cover every aspect of music with this album.  To be honest, there just aren't any words that can truly justify this album that haven't already been said.  Some personal favorites:  \\"Until the End of the World\\", \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\", \\"Acrobat\\", and of course the best U2 song ever, \\"One\\".
B0006399FS|4.0|<br />My first reaction to the CD was mixed but the more I listen, the more I find to appreciate and have no doubts that there will be quite a few people with early negative reviews that will have a change of heart soon. \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" alone was worth every cent I paid for the disk. As a few others have mentioned a U2 album always seems to have a way of growing on you and changing overtime.  <br />I bought the Deluxe edition with the DVD, thinking the three  tracks on the DVD would be remixes. They're not, just acoustic versions and U2 playing the songs in their studio.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|For those of us who came of age in the 80's, Live Aid is one of those events that we all remember where we were when it happened.  This DVD is worth more than nostalgia, however, as it catches many bands at either the apex of their careers (Queen, Sting, Duran Duran), or showing their great promise (U2, etc.)  A must have for the \\"Gen X\\" (sorry to use that term!) collection.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Why does everyone say that this is Green Day's worst album? I don't get it. I don't think it's a far cry from the rest of Green Day's work. Here's the song list- <br /> <br />1. Warning - I like it. It has a good message - \\"Caution: police line: you better not cross/Is it the cop or am I the one that's really dangerous?\\" This is the first music video of Green Day's I ever saw, back when I was in like, 5th grade. I thought it was really funny. <br /> <br />2. Blood, Sex and Booze - One of my favorite songs in the CD, I think. I'm not even sure why, it's just a really good song. <br /> <br />3. Church on Sunday - Uhh... I don't really like it. The change in tempo from the verses to the chorus really bugs me, and I ususally just skip it if I'm listening to the whole CD. <br /> <br />4. Fashion Victim - Another good song with a great message. The first verse talks about some guy who is a tool and he has no idea, and he just keeps going on, buying manufactured vintage crap. The second verse is pretty much the same thing, but about a girl, trying to keep up with the impossible standards of beauty we've got nowadays just so she can nab an older man, all while charging her merchandise to a credit card. It's such an awesome song. <br /> <br />5. Castaway - I like it. A lot. I could listen to it on repeat for days. It's really catchy and just gets stuck in your head. <br /> <br />6. Misery - A really strange song about all these lowlifes who in some way are connected to each other. I love it. <br /> <br />7. Deadbeat Holiday - All my friends really like this song, but I don't get what the big deal is about it. It's a good song, just not one of my favorites. It's about realizing there's no such thing as God and your life sucks, so let's just piss it all away. It's pretty good. <br /> <br />8. Hold On - It's alright. Not a favorite, but it doesn't suck. A harmonica is always cool. <br /> <br />9. Jackass - I didn't like it at first because it kinda hit a little close to home for me, but it grew on me. It's about a guy everyone knows- the guy who always makes everyone laugh but everyone just hates him anyways. <br /> <br />10. Waiting - It's fine. Doesn't suck. <br /> <br />11. Minority - Uhh... it's about rebelling against the establishment. It's alright, I guess... <br /> <br />12. Macy's Day Parade - A follow-up to Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life), its an acoustic song with heartfelt lyrics, all about looking back on your past, and then looking towards the future. If Blood, Sex and Booze wasn't my favorite song on the album, then this one is.
B000088E6D|1.0|Does he have a pleasant voice? Sure. But while Mr. Buble can carry a tune, he is completely void of any CHARACTER! What made Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. etc so popular is that they performed these songs with thier own style. Each sounded different from the others without stepping on anybody elses toes.  Michael Buble gives sterile, boring renditions of these timelss classics. On \\"Nice and Easy\\" he's anything but. Good lord boy, stop trying to crisply enunciate every single syllable! It's nice and easy, sing it that way.  If you've never spent any time listening to these classics, it's an ok starter album, but I would bet that any long tiime Sinatra listener won't give this much of a listen.  If the Josh Groban sheep think that this is torch music, that's a sad state of music knowledge these days. Do yourself a favor and buy \\"In the Wee Small Hours\\" and hear a true master at work, one who sings from his heart and not from a production board.
B0006399FS|1.0|generally any new album released by a band is overrated by the same band, and this is an example of that. 3 of the best bands from the 80's have released albums this year: The Cure, REM and U2. It's clear the only alive band is The Cure, with a worthy new album, while U2 and REM keep using the same uninspired and flat music. <br /> <br />Let's see... <br /> <br />80's U2: AWESOME, BRILLIANT <br />90'S U2: PURE GENIOUS, BRILLIANT <br />U2 2000: R.I.P <br /> <br />lamentably fans elevate and exaltate the band and increases this this fake feeling of greatness with a new LP that does not exceed the ordinary. <br /> <br />Is time for several things: <br /> <br />1- Bono must cut his hair, take off his sunglasses and all Rock Star stuff and start to concentrate in CREATING music again. <br />2- U2 must release a new album at most by early 2006, otherwise is officially dead. <br />3- Is the perfect time for \\"U2 Anthology\\", unreleased concerts from 80's and 90's on DVD, outtakes, etc, etc <br /> <br />
B00001QEE7|5.0|In 1989, Disney made a comeback ater having failures for about 10 years, and they returned to make fairy tales with the Little Mermaid, it might be 2 bad Disney can't make them like this anymore, the more recent movies like Lilo & Stitch, The Emperor's New Groove, Piglet's Big Movie, and Brother Bear are all cute films, but they might not live up to the classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, and the Little Mermaid. When this movie first came out on dvd, I could buy it on dvd since there was no dvd player in the house, and it was already out of stock by the time dvds first enter in my house, so last week I brought a copy of the film of the marketplace, even though I was quite disappointed in getting a hard cover copy of \\"How I changed my life\\". As the movie opens, there is a concert in the kingdom of King Triton (Kenneth Mars), featureing all of his daughters including the youngest Ariel (Jodie Benson), who is not present at the concert, who is off visiting a boat with her sidekick Flounder (Jason Marin), and finds a couple of human stuff, and adds it to her collection, while she has forgotten about the concert. But when she remains she rushes home, and is in trouble with her father, and tells her that he doesn't want to hear of her going to thee surface again. But once again she disobys her father, and goes off after seeig fireworks, and lays eyes on Price Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes). And she falls in love with him, and she saves his life when a strom hits, and brings him to land. But when a crab named Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) mistaken tells King Triton, he oderes her not to see her new human freind again, and destroys all her treasures including a new statue that was given to her from Flounder a few seconds before, which leads her into meeting Ursula (Pat Caroll) who worsk a deal, that if she trade her voice, and her fins, she will make a portion that will maek a human foe 3 days, and she will have to get Prince Eric to kiss her, to have her remain a human by sunset of the 3rd day.ve her remain a human by sunset of the 3rd day.
B000006TRV|3.0|When I was in High School I saw this album as a mantra for dissafected youth. I outgrew it rather quickly. What makes this such a weak album is that Richard Wright is not involved. Michael Kamen is a VERY poor substitute for Wright. Unfortunatly, Waters fired Wright early on into the sessions, seeing him as a rival for creative control of that band. But it was Wright's piano, played through his trademark Leslie speaker, that generated most of Floyd's classic songs. Kamen can't compete with that. Also, Wright sang better than Waters, who dominates the vocals. Only he doesn't usually sing on this album, mostly he just whispers or shouts. It's not without a few gems here and there: Hey You, Comforatbly Numb and Run Like Hell. But overall, ignore the hype and get Atom Heart Mother or Obscured By Clouds instead.
B0006399FS|3.0|I'm kind of upset...after all that HYPE?  THIS is what they came up with?  Every track seems boring and cliche.  Totally straight-forward and formulaic.  I wish I waited to read these reviews before wasting my money.  I'm just glad I got it on sale.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|Cuaron brought the magic of the Harry Potter universe to an outstanding level of artistic quality. Excellent cinematography, performances, and treatment of the story. But I strongly recommend to get the wide screen edition, NOT THE FULL SCREEN EDITION because on the full many (if not all) of the beautiful and great shots got cut off to fit on the full screen format, so it doesn't come out like you actually saw it on the theater. If you like the best viewing quality of this great movie, please get the WIDE SCREEN EDITION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|We are lucky to be alive to hear the work of this man. If you've ever seen him live, or seen one of his performances on film, then you KNOW this is a person who puts so much of what is lacking in performance of contemporary sound and that is FEELING. It blows my mind the criticism he's received accusing him of robbing the stylistic graves of his idols - excuse me? So do hundreds of other artists who can't even hold a candle in tribute no matter how hard their effort or sincerity. THIS is a man who takes whatever influences and MAKES THEM HIS OWN. I have no problem whatsoever picking out a riff or musical inflection out of any of his works in recognition of his predecessors. He writes, produces, and most impressive plays almost all instruments on his recordings. Lenny Kravitz is BEYOND reproach. I keep hoping one day to see the emergence of African-American BANDS, with LIVE INSTRUMENTS, getting AIRPLAY. Like back in the 70's, where there were numerous groups with plenty of organic vibes.
B00068IOWC|5.0|With \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" it can be said that U2 have finally come full circle. After a decade of experimenting, touring and putting their stamp on practically every popular genre of music from techno to classical, the band returns to the basics of what made their sound so fresh and their songs such popular classics. The usual U2 messages, ideas and questions are here, but with an urgency and style that is truly visceral and highly emotional. U2 is the biggest band in the world precisely because their music is full of so much passion and heart. Their songs are perfectly adaptable to radio, but they don't sound particularly made for simple commercial value. Like The Beatles, U2 knows how to churn out a hit but with great technical, melodic and emotional qualities. The opening number, \\"Vertigo,\\" is classic rock n' roll with a spacey, almost futuristic punkish feel that calls you back for another listen. The Edge really brings down the house here with his exhilarating guitar playing while Bono's lyrics are cryptive and fun. The ballad \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" keeps the tradition of long song titles from the band but it has a power and punch that few ballads these days could ever hope to achieve. Decorated with beautiful slide guitar and an almost operatic section, this song has a timeless quality. \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" is a dark, dramatic turn for the album. Is it a statement on the Iraq war? Or on the state of the world in general? Who knows, but the band makes it roar like a soaring anthem with heavy guitar licks in an almost Iggy Pop tradition. \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is a masterful album because like so many few albums, it is completely filled with great songs. Even the weaker tracks sound skillfull, like \\"One Step Closer.\\" \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\" is another strong track with a dreamy feeling and slick production. The return of original U2 producer Steve Lillywhite is most welcome here, especially on a hard rocking tracklike \\"All Because Of You\\" which is driving and exhilarating. \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is a wonderful love song, full of heartbreak and tender guitar melodies. Even now that U2 has dropped the excessive techno romping of \\"Pop,\\" they still go over the top, which is where we like them. Like the best rock albums, glorious excess is where this band shines best as in their previous masterpieces like \\"Achtung Baby\\" and even to some degree \\"Rattle And Hum.\\" \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is more of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" but for the 21st century. Bono's words are rich and full of spiritual flourishes while the Edge, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. and bassist Adam Clayton provide a smooth, sometimes heavy backdrop that sounds like pure, untarnished rock n' roll. This isn't just an album for U2 fans, rockers or 80's nostalgics (because this band has not stayed in the 80's), this is an album for ANYONE looking for majestic, exhilarating music.
B0002IU988|5.0|I loved Creed and bought all of their CDs and I understand there were many who completely hated them. But, you should give this a chance. Many have said Tremonti is an awesome guitarist despite their dislike for Stapp and Philips keeps the beat going with his percussion and Marshall is back on board for bass, which was desperately missed on Creed's third CD, \\"Weathered.\\" New singer Myles Kennedy is a huge switch from Stapp, who I thought was very passionate, but didn't have much range. Kennedy has a lot of range and sings with a great deal of emotion. However, if you didn't like Creed for their supposedly Christian lyrics, you may not like this CD because it has religious significance too, BUT IS MORE ABOUT LIFE RATHER THAN ONE'S SPIRIT. <br /> <br />My song reviews also contain a Creed-o-meter, which tells the value of Creed-likeness for you hatas out there. It is at the end, first number is overall rating. <br /> <br />1. Find the Real-10-This opener shouldn't remind anyone of Creed. It has a classical rock vibe and Kennedy shows his awesome range right off the bat near the end of the song. Tremonti offers a soaring solo on this one and has a great riff. This is a particular hard-hitter. About finding out who you are and what you want to be.  <br />COM-2 <br /> <br />2. One Day Remains-9-The title track is a great song with two searing solos by Tremonti and awesome opening by him and Philips. About living life to the fullest. <br />COM-3 <br /> <br />3. Open Your Eyes-10-I love the first single, the solo is awesome and lyrics are great. Great riff, one of the more Creed-like offerings on the CD. Seems to be about the new band, and realizing their different than Creed. <br />COM-9 <br /> <br />4. Burn It Down-9-Bluesy feel to it, very groovy, about starting over after you've messed up. Another awesome solo and good bass. <br />COM-6 <br /> <br />5-Metalingus-9-Very fast-paced and hard-hitting. Excellent song combining \\"cunnlingus\\" and \\"metal\\" to make \\"Metalingus\\" which I believe means stimulation of the metal-head that is in everyone, some just more than others. No solo, still good ax work. Awesome drums. No Creed here. About regretting the past and having an ephiphany. <br />COM-1 <br /> <br />6-Broken Wings-10-Maybe the best song on here. Very passionate. About standing up up for waht you believe in sacrificing yourself for it (possibly Biblical) or someone (as in war). <br />COM-7 <br /> <br />7-In Loving Memory-10-For those of you that don't know, Tremonti lost his mother recently to a brain tumor and now he's written a tear-jerking song in tribute to her. It is honest and touching. Very good. <br />COM-9 <br /> <br />8-Down to My Last-9-Excellent song that seems to have many meanings. The first verse seems to be a tribute to rock legends, the second verse seems to be a statement to Creed haters, and the pre-choruses (I think that's what they're called) seem to be to his mother. Nice solo. <br />COM-7 <br /> <br />9-Watch Your Words-8-Slaps you in the face out of some more Creed-like tunes. No solo, just heavy guitar playing, good song. Obviously, about regretting something you said, seems to have some religious lyrics as well. <br />COM-2 <br /> <br />10-Shed My Skin-10-Awesome song personal to Tremonti about maturing and talking about his past. Excellent ending. <br />COM-8 <br /> <br />11-The End Is Here-7-Weakest song for me, still pretty solid. Nice ending. Again, kinda about standing up for what you believe until the day you die. <br />COM-2 <br /> <br />There you have it. Recommended. Give it a chance, you Creed-hater. <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 101/110-92% kick-ass <br />Creed-O-Meter: 56/110-50% Creed free
006092988X|5.0|It is the first book that I read that really made an impression on me, and I was only 13 years old the first time I read it (That was over 40 years ago!).  I did not even realize how strong an impression it made until years later, as I began to grow and mature as a person.  I recently (1 year ago) sought out and bought a new copy for my two teenage daughters to read.  <br /> <br />I identified with Francie's plight, growing up in a 'poor', but rural, area, and becoming 'aware of life' at 13, when I first read the book.   <br /> <br />Betty Smith's portrayal of a 'survivor' of a disfunctional life and time is 'universal' and timeless.  Her poignant reflections of a young girl struggling and learning 'against the odds' are heartfelt and enduring. <br /> <br />(I believe she was a strong influence in my love of writing and story-telling)
B0006399FS|2.0|Vertigo, the first song, is of course great.  After that, I defy anyone to find something that's \\"catchy\\".  A few other tracks might be OK and the rest kind of meander like some kind of  U2 clone band.   <br />The thing that stood out about old U2 was how many tracks on a CD were great (not just OK).  No longer.  Download Vertigo from whereever and skip the rest.
B00068IOWM|4.0|Overall, the Collector's Edition is a MUST for any serious U2 fan. <br /> <br />THE CD: <br />I was expecting nothing more than an additional chapter of U2-Mach 3, which began with their most literal (and least poetic) record, `All That You Can't Leave Behind' (2000).  Of course, the profile of that record, and in particular, the uplifting singles \\"Stuck in a Moment\\" and \\"Walk On\\", straddling the fence between the realm of classic U2 and the stereotype knee-jerk anthems, were undoubtedly boosted by 9/11. <br />In a sense, my expectations were met - this record is also pretty literal.  But it is also much more personal.  Like the 2002 single, \\"Electrical Storm\\", the predominant them is love in a world of chaos.  Here is a song-by-song review: <br /> <br />1. \\"Vertigo\\".  With the state of radio being what it is (and not what it was in the age of `The Joshua Tree'), why not release a new song as a commercial for one of the biggest (and most importantly, still hip) innovations in the music industry - the IPod?  The brilliant marketing worked - the more I hear it, the more this tune grows on me, despite being nothing more than \\"Elevation II.\\" <br /> <br />2. \\"Miracle Drug\\".  The idea here is big anthems and big themes.  Although this song builds like \\"Beautiful Day\\" and has some of the Edge's best slide guitar work, the song's potential as a single is undermined by the obtuseness of the lyrical simile (\\"I've had enough of romantic love/I'd give it all up for a miracle drug\\"). <br /> <br />3. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\".  If \\"Miracle Drug\\" is the musical counterpart of \\"Beautiful Day\\", then this is the counterpart of \\"Stuck in a Moment\\" (complete with a nice falsetto performance by the Edge).  That said, this tune, years in the making while Bono's father was suffering from cancer that eventually took his life in August 2001, is arguably the best moment on the record (\\"I don't need to hear you say/That if we weren't so alive/You'd like me a whole lot more.\\")<br /> <br />4. \\"Love and Peace or Else\\".  In the pre-release press, much was made of the producer shuffle on this record, as U2 ultimately tagged Steve Lillywhite, the original producer of their first three records (1980-1983).  However, the award-winning team of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois take the helm for the most original track on the record - a bluesly barroom boogie buried in an ominous soundscape and perhaps the only overtly political tune on the record - showing that the band has not completely abandoned their desire to stretch musically, which was more a characteristic of U2 in the 1990s. <br /> <br />5. \\"City of Blinding Lights\\".   I was glad to hear Flood take the production helm (does anyone remember the grossly underrated `Pop' (1997)), but unfortunately, this mid-tempo ode to Bono's wife and musical hat-tipper to The Cure is really not one of the stronger tracks. <br /> <br />6. \\"All Because of You\\".  Bono initially characterized this as a rock record, with the Edge re-discovering the guitar and the band resisting their post-punk anti-rock inclinations.  In actuality, the acoustic guitar is very prominent on this record.  However, only \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"All Because of You\\" are true rock songs in the traditional sense.  Although this tune will likely be a pick for a second or third single, the band should have left such thinly-veiled, knee-jerk religious sentiments (\\"All because of you/I am\\") to the disastrous second record, `October' (1981). <br /> <br />7. \\"A Man and a Woman\\".  This is another love song, the sound of which screams \\"adult contemporary\\".  That said, I immediately liked it.  Bono provides some of his best vocals/lyrics (\\"I could never take a chance/At losing love for romance\\"), the Edge delivers a subtle acoustic guitar, and Adam Clayton drives a nice bass line for a really strong tune that did not receive much hype prior to the release of the record. <br /> <br />8. \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\".  Obstensibly, this is another love song (\\"Fromthe brightest star/Comes the blackest hole/You had so much to offer/Why did you offer your soul/I was there for you, baby/When you offered your hand/Why did you offer your soul/Would you deny to others/What you demand for yourself/Cool down, mama!/Cool it off!\\").  But as with many other great U2 songs, the song takes on another life and eventually comes to sound like a love letter from Bono and the rest of the world to the post-9/11 United States (\\"Where you live should not decide/Whether you live or whether you die\\"). <br /> <br />9. \\"One Step Closer\\".  As a return to the ethereal sounds of `The Unforgettable Fire' (1984), Bono's choice of lower octave for the vocals gives the song promise.  But ultimately, it feels more like an incomplete poem. <br /> <br />10. \\"Original of the Species\\".  Although the first ten seconds (a haunting and simple piano line) are promising, the song ultimately devolves into a rather forgettable, over-orchestrated tune much in the vein of \\"City of Blinding Lights\\". <br /> <br />11. \\"Yahweh\\".  No subtlety here.  See \\"All Because of You\\" and `October' record. <br /> <br />12. \\"Fast Cars.\\"  If you purchase the collector's edition box set or the import version of the record, you will find the bonus track, \\"Fast Cars\\", which was left off the album proper not because of quality, but because of its not-like-the-others sound.  That said, this middle-eastern influenced acoustic romp, pontificating upon the emptiness of modern existence (\\"Don't you worry about your mind/You should worry the day your pain goes away\\"), is quite a refreshing change for U2. <br /> <br />THE DVD: <br />The DVD is a very nice addition, featuring: <br /> <br />1. \\"U2 + 3\\".  This is a well-made 20-minute in-studio documentary on the making of the record, and in particular, the tunes \\"Sometime You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\", and \\"Vertigo\\". <br /> <br />2. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" (performance video) <br /> <br />3. \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" (live studio performance) <br /> <br />4. \\"Vertigo\\" (Temple Bar Mix).  (I loved this - Bono accompanied only by the Edge on banjo!) <br /> <br />5. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" (Bono/Edge acoustic couch mix) <br /> <br />6. \\"Vertigo\\" (performance video - NOT the official video) <br /> <br />THE BOOK: <br />For the collector's edition, U2 have taken a page (so to speak) from Pearl Jam and Radiohead, bands that have long since included band artwork and various musings (i.e., not lyrics) intimating the meaning of the songs, with the inclusion of a hard-cover book.
0385512104|2.0|I finally decided to purchase this book after all the great reviews i read.  Sadly, I was left disappointed after reading the final page.  This was not a great book, at best it was an interesting story with a few gems of knowledge.  Overall, I give this book 2 Amazon Stars.

B0006399FS|5.0|This album rocks. I know that's a cliched statement, but it's true. Being a fan of U2 in the 80's but growing a little tired of the overexposure, I was thrilled when Achtung Baby came out. Since then, my appreciation for U2 has only grown. I've loved all their albums since, even the under-appreciated Pop. But this is an album for both diehards and newcomers.  <br /> <br />A few reviews have said Bono & co. are repeating past glories. My question is, so what? They're putting a new spin on some classic U2 sounds. They've never had an album that's sounded louder and more aggressive. Yet, it's not simply volume without soul. Some of the most moving elements about the album are the heart-felt lyrics and the passionate way Bono renders them.   <br /> <br />Do you like U2? Buy this album. Are you tired of U2? Buy this album. It's worth it. So much music today is uninspired. This shows a group doing what they've done for two decades--put soul back into rock and roll.

B0002TT0NW|3.0|1) A lack of continuity with the Novel.  2) Key character motivations have changed; Draco Malfoy is reduced to nothing more than a caricature - a far cry from the pureblood prince convinced of his inherent superiority; Dumbledore provides uncomfortable and uncharacteristic comic relief at critical junctures in the film.  3)Characters have been inserted that did not originate with the book at the director's discretion.  4) The Mexican references and visual symbology, while undoubtably a tribute to the director's heritage, are a distraction since the novels are decidedly British in undertone.  5)The Prisoner of Azkaban (novel) is transitional, marking the end of youth and a passage into darker times to come; yet the director, inexplicably, after having made every effort to distinguish this film from its predecessors as darker and more mature, decides to terminate the movie on a childishly triumphant note with Harry soaring over Hogwarts on his new Firebolt.  An epilogue with Wormtail roaming the forests of Albania in search of Voldemort's lingering shadow, thereby fufilling Professor Trelawney's prophecy, would have served nicely as an ending.  6) In the film, Wormtail is a bloated toad; in the novels, he is a wasted, thin, paranoid wreck of a wizard.  7) For all its length, the film seems \\"rushed\\".  8) Machines do not function at Hogwarts because of all the magical interference; yet Professor Lupin is able to play a phonograph with no difficulty.  9) Ginny Weasley does not appear in the film at all.  10) Ghostly knights on horseback barrel through the castle repeatedly; while the Bloody Baron, Headless Nick, and Peeves are nowhere to be seen.
B0002KVULG|4.0|I love this movie.  <br /> <br />That's really all that needs said on the topic but given our culture's obsession with explanations, I will proceed with further comments. Firstly it's a very romantic, soft approach to a story that has otherwise been brutalized in the cinema. Most Dracula films drench the audience in blood and give us gruesome depictions of leering fangs, while this one alludes to things but is never expressly gory or gruesome. It's a softer approach that appeals in particular to females. Of course, who could doubt that -- one glimpse of Frank Langella sweeping into Lucy's life and carelessly tossing his long, menacing black cloak to the nearest forgotten servant is enough to set any woman's head spinning. Forget the composure of most villains, Dracula has all the beguiling sexuality of a dozen infamous Don Juans that send the very Victorian women in his life to utter confusion. Frank Langella was ingenious for the part, reprising a role he'd already defined on Broadway. <br /> <br />Everyone complains about the quality transfer and how this film has been forced into a nearly black and white canvas in order to create a gothic effect. Having not seen the original, I didn't find it disappointing, just a fabulous mood-setter. I know this will probably regulate my review to the bottom of the pile, but it's a matter of preference that lends a certain morbid flair to the piece. They had a marvelous palate to work with in the first place, from the Grecian architecture of the castle to the morose English countryside in midwinter, when death surrounds the morbid asylum and its pensive graveyard. The film manages to be very haunting and beautiful at the same time, indwelling romance while never allowing us to forget the sinister surroundings. <br /> <br />For concerned parents and sensitive viewers, the R-rating seems heavy handed in comparison to most modern films. Gore is minimal, language is nonexistent, and sexual content consists more of underlining tension and passionate kissing than anything heavy-handed. The extras are also very nice, although in some respects the director's commentary rehashes much of what we've already heard on the featurette, which is by far the most marvelous addition. Interviews with some of the cast and crew, as well as reminiscences about filming, remind us that this wasn't just a movie, it was an adventure from beginning to end, from Laurence Olivier's increasingly bad health but persistent determination to do his best (and he turns in a fine performance) to Frank Langella's surprising thoughts on the film's love scene. <br /> <br />It may not please anyone desiring leering fangs and blood spattered walls, but I certainly enjoyed it.
B0006284JQ|4.0|I have to be honest that when Britney Spears came out, I just found her attractive but her music didn't call my attention at all. But then when I heard \\"ME AGAINST THE MUSIC\\" next to Madonna and \\"TOXIC\\" I bought her cd \\"IN THE ZONE\\" and found it very interesting.  <br />Now with this cd I notice that Britney's performances are getting better with time and a proof of that are her latest singles \\"MY PREROGATIVE\\" and \\"EVERYTIME\\". With this latest songs you realize that Britney is not a child any more. <br />The song selection for this production is good including her biggest hits such as \\"I'M A SLAVE FOR YOU\\", \\"STRONGER\\", \\"TOXIC\\" and \\"SOMETIMES\\" plus three new songs and remixed versions of \\"CRAZY\\", \\"BOYS\\" (feat. Pharrell Williams) and \\"OVERPROTECTED\\" but I feel sorry that \\"I LOVE ROCK N' ROLL\\" isn't here. It should have been added in the bonus cd that contains remixes of \\"TOXIC\\", \\"EVERYTIME\\", \\"BREATH ON ME\\" and \\"OUTRAGEOUS\\". Another thing that would've been great was a remix of her latest single \\"MY PREROGATIVE\\" but well on every greatest hits album we all find songs missing. <br />Finally I want to say that this is a good album, it may not be your favorite but it has some great songs.
B0006284JQ|5.0|It's because most of the people on here are a bunch of conservative idiots who think there's something wrong with growing up, smoking, and sleeping around with *gasp*... more than one person. Grow up. Britney's music is changing and she's changing as an artist. This album reflects her growth from young teenage virgin girl to grown mature woman who *gasp*... has sex and smokes.  <br /> <br />Also, \\"Outrageous\\" charted at no. 76 on the Hot 100, while \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" did not even chart, which explains why it was left off. The reason \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" was left off is because it is an absolutely HORRIBLE song. And as far as the new tracks, the only one I really like is \\"My Prerogative\\". This is the best time for her to remake this song. If you just read what the idiot conservative people are saying about her on this site, you'll get the picture. I find it apalling that people in the 21st century still think there is something wrong with sex, alchohol, and cigarettes.

It can be considered \\"heavier\\" than their previous three albums, but you can really hear how they have matured as musicians and as people (at 40 years old you think they'd be somewhat mature by now!) I can honestly say that there isn't a song on here that I don't like, although \\"Amerika\\" has a lot of English in it and I don't prefer Till's voice in English. Other than that, it is a stellar record and even if you don't speak German, it will blow you away. Buy it now! You will not be disappointed!
B00068IOWC|4.0|The latest flavor of the u2's arsenal IS NOT as bad as a few of the mentioned reviews. It grows on you, not the lyrics always, but the overall blend of the band's music and tone. Let's face it, you can just keep going like the Stones and Aerosmith, or still put out some pretty good back to back CD's like u2 has done, and be remembered for them. I didn't like it at first, but then before you know it has grown on you, just like the Seinfeld episode of George C. when he kept keep saying COSTANZA over & over to his date, She was drawn into it after hearing it a few times......this is how this CD is.. IT GETS IN YOUR HEAD AND SOUNDS GOOD after awhile  <br /> <br />w/bonus singles make on overall cool mix...  <br />FAST CARS...  <br />my cell is ringing no idea I need to know who is calling,.... I got the nightly news to get to know the ENEMY...  <br />All I want is a picture of you.....wouldn't it be great to know the enemy............
B0006399FS|3.0|Yup, it's another mixed review album - and honestly, I feel the same way. <br /> <br />Many reviewers, and undoubtedly many listeners, have heard this album and declared it is `boring,' `thin,' etc.  Even many U2 fans have spoken these words!  In essence, some of them are correct.  Looking deep into many of the songs you may be able to find deep meanings and `inspiring ballads,' but the truth is this is a rock band producing a rock album and rock fans expect instant entertainment.  On these fronts Vertigo and All Because of You will deliver.  For the rest, people will remain in limbo.  I would enjoy many of these slower songs if they sounded like `Where the Streets Have No Name' or `With or Without You,' but they don't come across as classics. <br /> <br />We should all remember to not speak to soon, though, as many listeners are aware that U2's songs do grow on you.  But I can say that I can best review an album from the world's perspective from the first few listens (a paradigm I currently occupy), and I'm giving it a grade C+.  Being a U2 fan, I am patient in listening to the songs in their entirety and looking close at lyrics, etc.  But while sharing a perspective of another reviewer here I'm forced to agree that I get a certain distraction while listening.  I seem to start thinking about work or wondering about tomorrow's weather forecast while I listen to what will be my most anticipated U2 album.  How did this happen, I wonder? <br /> <br />I'm certainly not the standard U2 fan.  My favorite four albums are Pop, Achtung Baby, War, and Boy (in order from most favorite to less).  This album reminds me of All That You Can't Leave Behind, and not so much because of songs or rhythm, but because of an overall rating and sense.  Both albums have annoying long names and seem to lose the listener.  Beautiful Day and Elevation turned into U2's excitement for the album (much like Vertigo and All Because of You may eventually become), but from there on out, nothing stands out.  Sure, New York, Kite, Wild Honey and the rest of sort of grown on me and I now enjoy listening to them, but it took FOUR YEARS!!!  And besides, when I want to listen to U2, I play Discotheque, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Even Better than the Real Thing, With or Without You, Out of Control, Bullet the Blue Sky...  See, though I like the others, I don't dig through a mess of CD's to find `Wild Honey.'  My guess is that many of How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb's songs will turn that way, and I'm left with another mediocre album with only a few hits. <br /> <br />One final remark - Albums such as the Joshua Tree and War are known as U2's great ALBUMS.  Yes, Elevation (especially the Tomb Raider Remix) and Beautiful Day are great U2 SONGS, but whenever someone mentions All That You Can't Leave Behind the crowd will inevitably shrug its shoulders and walk away uninterested. <br /> <br />Well, I it looks like my domain purchases of u2atomic.coom, u2bomb.com and u2atomicbomb.com we're all a bad investment.  Wish me luck next time guys! <br />

B0006399FS|1.0|I know kids that listen Britney Spears and Robbie Williams will love this new U2 album. A cheap album.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|An excellent adventure with loads of directorial style, a welcome change from the static diorama-like feel of the first two movies. The move to Scotland creates a depth of reality to the setting that grounds flights of fancy. I'm no Harry Potter fan, but watching the other films (and reading \\"Order of the Phoenix\\") has convinced me that Rowling's love of creating delightful details, much like JRR Tolkien's love of creating linguistic effects, is best kept in the background for the translation to screen. \\"Prisoner\\" succeeds in this, thankfully reducing the requisite Quidditch sequence that was so tiresome in \\"Stone\\" and \\"Chamber\\", and allowing the fantasy world to exist in and of itself rather than being pointed out and explained at every moment. <br /> <br />The color palette is a briskly refreshing change from the Thomas Kinkade golden glow of the first two movies. Blue and gray gives a gritty, even cruel edge to the environment. <br /> <br />David Thewlis turns in an excellent performance as Lupin, with a quiet and piercing bit of social commentary involving concerned parents not wanting their children to be taught \\"by someone like me\\" and then shutting the various boxes, cases, and closets of his office. Michael Gambon recreates Dumbledore, reducing the ethereal saintliness and adding a faintly perilousness to his humor. Dumbledore must be taken more seriously, it seems. <br /> <br />I was disappointed by the relative lack of screen time given to Gary Oldman, but his best scenes turn the premise of the apparent plot on its ear, and are very touching. <br /> <br />All three of the principals are growing in stature, ability, and, frankly, looks. The varying ways of wearing school uniforms and the presence of real-life clothing makes for a welcome contrast to the fantastic elements, such as the time-turner and the wands. Emma Watson is still a bit stiff, but perhaps that is part of her character. Rupert Grint is ever more appealing, and adding a bit of welcome roughness to Ron. Daniel Radcliffe expresses the ever-more-obvious darker aspects of Harry's power and past with unexpected skill. <br /> <br />The magic itself felt tangible, real, and far from laughable, as it had in the first two movies (with the exception of the revelation of the villain in \\"Chamber\\"). Indeed, the ultimate confrontation between Harry and the dementors was a scene where a very simple visual and sound effect transformed what would be a silly premise into a scene that thrilled, inspired, and awed. <br /> <br />Simply, an excellent movie, and one the non-Potter fan can enjoy (probably more than the devoted Potter fans would.)
6300273199|5.0|if you buy this video it will change your life in the greatest way ever. especially if your a huge fan of the thunder from down under!!!! i promise this video will entertain you like nothing else before for every minute you watch it!!!!
B00067BBQE|3.0|I too have been looking forward to this for months, after obtaining a bootleg cologne germany live show that had lightning fast unwatchable editing. So I figured an official performance, well it's gotta be better.  Nope.  Love the band, love the sound, but I agree with the reviewer about the ADD type editing. It gave me a headache.  If you're a die hard, u'll  get it no matter what.  I realize they have to sell to the latest mtv generation, but breakneck speed editing should be saved for music videos.  A good example of a goof performance dvd is Heart Alive in Seattle.  The extras, especially the backstage antics are fun to watch, and of course the videos are great.  Also look for a  little easter egg (highlight the behind the scenes, click left arrow a few times and u'll see a logo light up)  Not the best video to show what evanescence looks like, that's for sure..  \\"look that's amy...er wait.. no that's the guitar.. or is that.. wait there's the drumm..no there's the crowd, there she is that's wha...nope that's the bassist..\\"
B0006284JQ|5.0|I've heard people complaining about Born to make you happy not being included on the CD released in US. Well here in UK there's a total of 19 songs including Born to make you happy and I love rock n roll. Also we've got a cooler Cd cover with it being shiny silver.well just informin all of you guyz hehe.Anyway, this CD totally rocks. Do Something(A new track) being the coolest. It ranks with Toxic and Baby one more time being my top picks.
B0000046KM|5.0|I believe Shirley Horn and this CD are an undiscovered treasure. Well into her seventies and not recently in the best of health, Ms. Horn is a national treasure for jazz lovers. While she barely sings above a whisper, her emotion,timing and phrasing are on par with Sinatra--heady company indeed. This album showcases her vocal and piano skills in a golden light.Combined with the lush overlay of Johnny Mandel's beautiful string arrangements, this is a truly glorious cd that stays with you. Rarely have I seen a CD described on Amazon in such universally passionate and glorious terms.
B0002YLC24|2.0|Wow.  How could the director of Before Sunrise create such a wasteful movie.  I truly looked forward to this second installment from the moment I heard about it.  I found myself being put-off by the political statements that he felt his characters needed to make, instead of focusing on their lost friendship. <br /> <br />I was also bothered by Ethan Hawkes new found southern accent which was no place to be found in the original. <br /> <br />So much could have been done with this film.  So little was.
B0006399FS|3.0|If you dont listen carefully, many of the tracks are in the style of Joshua Tree and that isn't a bad thing at all.  The pointlessly long, bland ballads really bring the CD down:  Lose those and there's some great U2 tasks here. <br /> <br />The CD can sometime sound too much like \\"U2 covering U2.\\"
B00030590I|3.0|In 1992, Zhang Yimou's HERO (Buena Vista), China's most expensive production (also it's biggest hit) won an Oscar© as Best Foreign Language Film.  It was purchased by Miramax and sat on the shelf for two years and then became a surprise hit in the U.S. when it was released theatrically.<br /><br />Jet Li is charismatic as the nameless man who confronts the emperor with three weapons from three assassins who had sworn to kill the emperor.  As he tells the story of each man, we see these episodes exquisitely filmed with dazzling action and in a dominant color.<br /><br />Words fail to convey the scope and beauty of this stunning film that, when all is said and done, is a sweeping philosophical metaphor for totalitarianism.  (Isn't there always a political agenda for such grand enterprises approved by the Chinese government.)<br /><br />Limited extras include a short, lively conversation between a distracted, plump Quentin Tarantino and a polite, almost shy Jet Li with film clips showing Li's extraordinary martial arts fighting skills from other films.  (Li was a top martial arts champion for five years starting when he was only 13!)
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 has released unbelievable music over the past 24 years and their newest album is one of their best.  I understand why some hardcore U2 fans might be disappointed.  U2 is constantly picking up fans as it trucks along through rock history.  For some fans the anger of 'War' represents their U2.  For others its the wild vibes of Achtung and Zooropa.  And now a younger generation has latched onto the soulful pop senisibilties of All That You Can't Leave Behind.  Every single group of fans is protective of and wants to re-live that moment in time when they lost their U2 virginity. <br /> <br />'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is the thesis of U2's long musical journey.  As a result its the most eclectic and even collection of songs they have ever produced.  Yes, such a sonic buffet sacrificies a consistent musical mood or an experimental B-Side to the album.  Most of U2's albums read like a book from start to finish.  But, within those books there were the filler chapters.  The Refugee, 4th of July, & So Cruel are decent songs within the context of their albums, but little else. <br /> <br />After all epic opuses of the 80's and innovation of the 90's U2 just wanted to create and album of the best 10-12 songs possible.  They tried, with some success on ATYCLB, but the 2nd half of that album fell flat on its face. <br /> <br />U2 has stepped up to the challenge this time and has done it.  There is not a bad song on the album.  It wreaks of vintage U2 from many different time periods, but is also totally original.  They also manage to subtely craft the theme of 'the unseen bonds of the world that hold us together'.  And it holds the great songs together.  The uncertainty and fear of Vertigo and Miracle Drug.  The mortality of Sometimes and One Step Closer.  Sexual love in A Man and a Woman.  And don't forget about the master of the unseen, Yahweh.  The band isn't trying too hard to make the tracks this way, but instead it seems to have happened naturally. <br /> <br />Vertigo, Miracle Drug, Sometimes..., City of Blinding Lights, and Original of the Species are some of the greatest songs they have ever produced.  A Man & A Woman, One Step Closer, Crumbs from Your Table, and Yahweh are growers,but will become instant classics to some listeners.  Love & Peace and All Because of You are the only songs that have a hint of being forced, but are still excellent. <br /> <br />Its hard to re-create the magic of Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby, but I believe in time this album will enter that pantheon.  <br /> <br />
B000002A46|5.0|Wow! This album really exemplifies the holiday season for me.  I think this album speaks for itself when you look at how popular it is after being around for 10 years.  I understand there are a lot of Christmas albums that are a lot older that 10 years that sell very well every year, but most of those people(Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, etc) are not ridiculed in the media(I know she's done some crazy stuff - TRL/popsicle episode anyone? ) or talked about all the time like Mariah. Anyways, off the soapbox...This CD is SO GOOD! She sounds PERFECT (naturally) and the songs are spot-on! It's just superb! buy it! buy it! buy it!
B0006284JQ|5.0|Some of the people in here that given her a bad review was just a bunch of losers trying to lower the album's ratings.Buy this and you'll know what I mean that this particular greatest hits Cd is all worth it.Believe me. My favorite track as of now from the cd was Do SOmething, it's really a different Britney. More like of Gwen Stefani track but yep it's Britney.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Back in the early 80's, I admired Journey. Among so many other groups that had more of a canned and prepackaged sound, Journey had the distinctive sound of Steve Perry. And the beauty of his vocal style was that it was so difficult to do and he made it sound so easy.  I had a cover band that tried to do some of their hits.  But as good as my lead singer was,  \\"Open Arms\\" would kill his voice. Perry was unmatched in the 80s. <br /> <br />It's too bad the polyps destroyed his vocal cords and forced him to retire all too soon.  I'd thought the ending fate for Journey was sealed.  So I cherished the old albums and CDs in the collection like so much objet d'art. <br /> <br />And along comes this Augeri dude, with an identical delivery and a similar stage presence.  And suddenly,  Journey is as strong as ever.  With basically the same lineup, and Neal Schon taking more risks and boosting his input,  the band never sounded better. And that's good news. <br /> <br />This is a hugely awesome concert.  The sound quality is tremendous and full. The quality of the recording is outstanding. Their energy bursts from the screen. And all their old familiar hits are right there, peppier and livelier than the studio versions, the band hitting you in the face with the power of their musicianship, tightness and selection.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend to all Journey fans and to those who may not be old enough to remember them in their old prime.  They're in their resurrected prime now!!  Get this one and be transported to a place where you'll be entertained \\"Faithfully\\".
B0006399FS|5.0|It is disappointing to see anyone giving this album a negative review.  This is one of U2's best albums to date, hands down.  It has an incredible earthy sound and follows ATYCLB's footsteps away from the more flashy music of the 90's.  What really sets this album apart, however, are the lyrics.  Bono puts some of his most heartfelt and emotional lyrics into this album and they greatly add to its power.  I don't see how anyone can listen to this album without being moved, and if they can they clearly aren't listening.  U2 are still the kings of Rock.
B0006399FS|1.0|After 10 listenings...answer is simple: For Money.    I can't believe this. U2, a well known and very respected band, making such a disaster of album for money, only money. And the fans swallow the merchandise, like always. WAKE UP, WAKE UP DEAD FANS. U2 can left all their past behind, can leave all attempt to make music behind, all honesty, all messages, all activism, all passion, but the only thing they can't leave behind is MONEY.  Many of these songs are clear signs that U2 are now long in tooth.  I feel embarresed while listening to this new U2 album. This album is nauseatingly bad to anyone who knows just a bit about how to write songs and create music.   If being a \\"U2 fan\\" means being a blindly adoring fanboy , I'm not a U2 fan. But actually I'm a die hard U2 fan !!! but I can't stand listening this \\"nice\\" U2, sorry.
B000002B7M|4.0|Blizzard of Ozz; his first solo album  <br /> <br />At the time this was released Ozzy was already one of the early pioneers of heavy metal.  When he started his solo career he proved he could still make good music, with the help of the talented Randy Rhoads of course.  Overall I think most of the Black Sabbath catalog (with Ozzy) is better than Ozzy's solo efforts, although Blizzard of Ozz is good enough to surpass some Sabbath outings such as Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die.  Twin rock staples Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley dominate this album with strong contributions from I Don't Know, Suicide Solution and Revelation (Mother Earth).
B000268QB2|4.0|<br />..nothing more to the add to the US reviews (soring choruses, great voice, instantly hooks you in..) except they're even better live!
B0006399FS|4.0|I've never bought a U2 cd until now.  Didn't dislike them, just didn't like them enough to buy a whole album.  But Vertigo made me sit up and listen.  I liked it so much that I bought the cd without having heard what any of the other songs sounded like.  Having now listened to the whole thing, I have to say I didn't waste my money at all.  I love it.  Yeah, it sounds a lot like their old stuff, but isn't that a GOOD THING?  I've been feeling nostalgia for the 80's lately, but I get more excited by new music than old. This cd scratches both those itches.  I highly recommend it... Especially to you people who aren't die-hard U2 fans, because you won't pick it apart like they will.
020530902X|5.0|There is no reason not to own this book. Small and inexpensive and easy to fit in your pocket, THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE should accompany the Gideon Bible in every motel room in America. Never have so many owed so much to so few pages.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt
B0002Y69NG|4.0|During the following I will intend to describe as best and briefly as possible this collection. I also will mention some differences between this collection and the original releases. Enjoy. <br /> <br />The difference between the limited and the unlimited editions are: The Limited Edition comes in a plastic box with trays, a Neo bust and an 80 page booklet that lists the extras of the 10 disks (yes, that's all it does). Besides this the sets are the same. <br /> <br />These two sets include all three films, The Animatrix, the film footage shot for Enter the Matrix videogame and 106 documentaries. The bonus disks for Reloaded and Revolutions are different from those included in the versions already released. <br /> <br />REMASTERD: The movies were enhanced so the films look brighter in color and richer in details. Don't worry it was not done by Gorge Lucas. The films are the same. <br /> <br />AUDIO: Also enhanced (not that it was necessary). Voices are stronger, gentle noises stand out more and details were sweetened just a bit. Great work! <br /> <br />DISK 1: The Matrix. The original commentaries, the music only audio track, follow the white rabbit, take the red pills... ALL ARE MISSING in this version. It comes with two commentaries worth listening to, a written intro from the Wachowski bros., and a ROM feature. <br /> <br />DISK 2: The Matrix Revisited. It includes the entire contents of the original disk except the fanboy stuff. <br /> <br />DISK 3: The Matrix Reloaded. Two new commentaries and a ROM feature. <br /> <br />DISK 4: The Matrix Reloaded Revisited. All new stuff such as a 17-min look at the fight in the Merovingian's chateau, 55-min dissection of the car chase, 40-min look at the Neo vs. 100 Smith battle, 7-min segment on Neo vs. Seraph and more. <br /> <br />DISK 5: The Matrix Revolutions. Two new commentaries and a ROM feature. <br /> <br />DISK 6: The Matrix Revolutions Revisited. Includes a tour of the set, 27-min piece on the Club Hel fight (ceiling walkers), segments on the workers and extras, 17-min profile of Neo vs. Smith final battle, 36-min piece covering the soundtrack, film editing, etc. and more. <br /> <br />DISK 7: The Animatrix. Just as we all remember it. <br /> <br />DISK 8: The Roots of the Matrix. Two documentaries: 1-Return to Source: The Philosophy of The Matrix: is an hour long discussion on the philosophical elements of the movie. And 2-The Hard Problem: the Science Behind the Fiction is an hour long discussion of the science of the films and its possibilities for a real life Matrix. <br /> <br />DISK 9: The Burly Man Chronicles. This is a 94-min featurette documenting the whole 276 day shoot for films 2 and 3. Profiles, interviews, a tribute to Alliyah and more are also found on this disk. Although almost nothing is said about Gloria Foster (the original Oracle). <br /> <br />DISK 10: The Zion Archive. Here we find storyboards and concept art for all three films; trailers and music videos for all three films; video effects in various states of completion and a Matrix Online game preview. <br /> <br />Overall: Excellent collection and a must for fans. If you are not a hardcore fan though and you like this collection, you may want to purchase the one without Neo's bust. It's cheaper and the booklet is only a guide to the extras on the 10 disks which are all included in both sets. The Wachowskis DO NOT give any commentaries on these disks which may be disappointing for some fans. But over all this is a great collection. You may add it to the ones you already own with confidence. There are more goodies in these disks not mentioned here so have fun exploring. Just follow the white rabbit and remember... there is no spoon. <br />
B0002TT0NW|5.0|This is the 3rd in the series of movies and it definately won't be the last.  Originally saw this in the movie theater and I must say the small tv screen doesn't do it justice.  However, it is still a good movie.  It is nice to see how these 3 main young actors have grown since the first movie(physically as well as their acting abilities). <br /> <br />The movie is like most movies that are made from novels, it doesn't following the original novel but you still get the jist of what is going on.  If every movie followed the books they were made from letter for letter it would make for some dull and very long movies.   <br /> <br />This movie is much darker then the first two, but it was done very tastefully and very well!  I believe that most people who view this movie will enjoy it!  But I would highly recommend seeing the first two movies before seeing this one.
0345451325|4.0|The first book of this trilogy details the formation of the Spartan II/Mjolinar program, including the origination of the characters Master Chief, Captain Keyes and Cortana. \\"Fall of Reach\\" fleshes out the backstory. How did the Covenent happen upon humanity in the first place? What were our first encounters with the Covenent like? What does \\"glassing a planet\\" entail? And what is it that the Covenent is after?<br /><br />The last question isn't answered completely, but this first volume does provide some tantalizing details that might give you a clue. You do, however, find out exactly what the Pillar of Autumn was up to prior to ending up in orbit around Halo.<br /><br />Eric Nylund does a great job of injecting some humanity into the Spartans (yes, there's more than one) and some drama and strategy into fight scenes with the Covenent. If you find yourself liking this book, you may want to pick up Nylund's \\"Signal to Noise\\" or \\"A Signal Shattered\\". No matter how good Nylund's military sci-fi is, his hard sci-fi is better.

B0000024UF|5.0|I Dont know how I came to adore Leonard Cohen, I remember watching that movie \\"Pump Up The Volume\\" with Christian Slater and wondering who sang that song \\"Everybody Knows\\", and then later when I was searching through my fathers old record collection coming across him again.  His voice is so deep and soothing and his lyrics are absolutely amazing.  I read somewhere that Leonard was a accomplished poet and  one can definitely tell.  Ive tried to get into his later work but they just dont have the same beauty as this one.  This album will never get old,  its a necessity to every music lovers collection.  Every song is wonderful. <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 proves their staying power with this album. From the deliriously catchy \\"Vertigo\\" to the glam \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" to the wonderful \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", they live up to the hype and then some. Bono's voice sounds as wonderful as it ever did and The Edge seems to have rediscovered his guitar. My only two quibbles are: (1) I wish more of the songs were like \\"Vertigo\\" and (2) I didn't really care for the song \\"Yahweh\\". But that's just me. Anyways, get a copy and enjoy!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|after I heard her \\"full of Grace\\" on Buffy (which I also only watched last summer) and \\"Angel\\" online, I've fallen completely in love with her!!!!! her songs are definitely my type of song, out of ordinary yet beautiful. I think this album is much better than surfacing. eventhough surfacing has songs that are mostly good \\"full of grace\\"(my all time favorite, this is the song that made me cry at the end of the season finally of Buffy season two!!!)and \\"Angel\\" and \\"I do what I have to do\\". But the weakness of it is that Sarah McLachlan has such a beautiful voice but she doesn't show it. in afterglow, however, she shows off her voice full potentially, making the songs flow very well and made it more real. I love it!!!!!
0920668364|2.0|I get what the author is trying to show in this book (unconditional love that you have for your child is endless and no matter how old they are) but I did find it a bit odd that when the child is around nine and then a teenager and then he is a man and moves out and the mom still goes to his house, physically picks him up when he is sleeping and sings that lullaby. Then when she is too old the man holds the mom and sings the lullaby. In my own opinion, I believe that the author went to an extreme to show a mom's love for her child. I have to say I feel it was a little creepy too. My children ages 4 and 2 don't really seem impressed with the book at all. They do not request it at bedtime or any other time for that matter. I wouldn't recommend this book.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|I LOVED this film.  I knew of Alig and had seen \\"Party Monster-The Shockumentary\\" and wanted more.  Well, \\"Party Monster\\" delivered. <br /> <br />Mackauly Culkin and Seth Green have both received scathing reviews of their portrayal of the wacky Club Kids Michael Alig and James St. James.  They have been called plastic, over the top, and just plain too queer.  Well, what better describes these two real-life larger than life characters?  The actors' affected, stiff portrayals are a brilliant interpretation of the constant theatre put on by such infamous Club Kids.  I used to be annoyed by Culkin, but after this, and \\"Saved\\" he has joined his brother Kieran at the top of my list of great actors.  I can even forgive Seth Green his MTV affiliation after this performance. <br /> <br />To continue, the casting was sublime and Marilyn Manson was a stroke of genius to fill the sparkling platform shoes of Christina.  The costuming was dead-on and avoided looking too \\"Hollywood\\" by maintaining that home-made quality to the outfits that were originally fashioned by broke kids.  The soundtrack was appropriate but never obvious, a trap many 1980's period films fall into.  The script was funny, objective, shocking and even touching at times.  The cinematography was well done and I especially enjoyed the film angles in the hotel room bathroom and out of the rat's hole.   <br /> <br />In short, I loved it. <br />Favorite line:  \\"That's not a crack hole, it's a rat hole.  Rats on crack attack!\\" <br />
B0006FFRW0|5.0|This 5.1 mix rocks, the way Trent layers his music masks a lot of sounds, with different sounds going to different speakers it really kicks up the notes in this release.  Subtle new versions of each songs are created with the 5.1 mix.  Old fans will enjoy and new fans will come to appreciate.  This music was made for 5.1 sound it just didn't have a medium in 1994.
B000002H6C|5.0|\\"I pledge allegiance to Metallica!\\" This is what came to my mind after listening to Metallica's 1988 hit album \\"And Justice for All...\\" The album captures exactly what true heavy metal actually is and stands for. From the first inspirational harmonized guitar intro to \\"Blackened\\" (the first song on the album), to the fast double bass, down and dirty ending to Dyers Eve, the album sends you on a emotional rollercoaster ride through their life perspectives which has been a catharsis for all those who listen.    Blackened, the opening song for the album, does such a great job introducing the greatest metal band of all time, that Metallica uses it as the opening song at almost every one of their shows. The songs on this album all have strong relevant lyrics, that effect anyone who listens. Also musically the lyrics emotions are complemented and encouraged by the instrumentals throughout every single song. There is not one song that lacks emotion, creativity or talent on the whole album.   \\"I can't remember anything, Can't tell if this is true or dream, Deep down inside I feel to scream, This terrible silence stops me.\\" This is the first verse of \\"One\\" which is quite possibly one of Metallica's most intelligent and exciting creations. It starts off with a solemn feel accompanied by a lone acoustic guitar in the background which gradually rises up to an explosion of frustrated emotions in a war on one's life.   In the song \\"Dyers Eve\\" James's lyrics are expressing the acute frustration he had when living with his family as they censored what he did, what he said, and where he was. He looks at his family as a creative barrier during his childhood and expresses his absolute disgust with that. \\"Dear Mother, Dear Father, You've clipped my wings before, I learned to fly, Unspoiled, Unspoken, I've outgrown that f******* lullaby, Same thing I've always heard from you, `Do as I say, not as I do'\\" this verse shows how James could persevere through even during the worst times that they were trying to hold him back.    Metallica is so often overlooked by many people as just another metal band that sings about killing, raping, and other sadistic things, but in reality their lyrics show the true emotions behind the band members and the views they have on the world. Metallica is an example to the entire metal scene, and they are the ultimate metal force in the world. The \\"And Justice for All...\\" album in every aspect is their greatest creation to date as far as I am concerned. And even if you are just looking for a hard hitting in your face album with tons of face melting guitar solos than you would be right at home with this album.
B00005JLEX|1.0|Jerry and Larry are so unprepared in their commentary on this DVD (OK I could only listen to their first one). After seeing so many great movie and TV commentaries (take any Buffy DVD season for example) how dissapointing it was to hear Jerry and Larry talk about \\"nothing\\". A big disappointment for all to the fans who have waited for this DVD release. My rating is on the commentary.... Seinfeld as a show is the greatest so buy the DVD sets.
B0002TT0NW|2.0|Cris Columbus, save us! This Hitler impersonater tells us he want's a two hour movie instead of a three hour one. What do I say about a three hour movie? So What! Lord of the Rings was three hours long, and I've watched all three hundreds of times!
140003180X|4.0|This fourth book in the series brings not a heck of a lot of detective work, and none of the astute problem-solving that made book one a literary treasure.<br /><br />The main attractions this time are the opening of a rival detective agency powered by testosterone, the launching of a typing school for men powered by girl power, a long overdue apology powered by guilt, and at long last, a love interest for Mma. Makutsi, powered by hair grease and slime.<br /><br />The author takes us a few levels deeper into the characters this time, and the result is a rich African brew, ideal for slow lazy sipping under a shady tree with a gentle breeze ruffling the pages, and of course a hot cup of bush tea.<br /><br />Not ground breaking or earth shattering, but a very pleasant read anyway.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 23, 2004
0783225849|5.0|Has all aspect of a fantastic, wet-your-pants, horror film. It is finely directed by Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense. THis time he incorporates a thieving cow, an isolated loony in a motel and a head-splitting horror tune and you get Psycho. This film is an indoubted classic, it starts with some inept Janet Leigh after she steals off her boss, she goes on the run and stops at the infamous 'Bate's Motel' to her peril, she has no idea that within half an hour she is murdered in the even more infamous 'shower scene' and then disposed of in the boot of her car. Then a little later on a cop of some sort tries to track her down and ends up stopping at the motel she was murdered at a little time earlier. He ends up being killed too weh nhe decides to check out the creepy house that Mr Bates lives in. After a short interlude of figuring out what happened he is soon apprehended and branded as the psycho. THE END. <br /> The score to the film and the sheer suspense created by Hitchcock whilst watching is phenomonal and this is what leaves the film as a cult classic in every respect. <br /> It may be a bit of a no brainer slashfest but it is always going to be soomewhere in mine (and probably everyone else's) mind because it is too good and too influential to forget.
B000687M48|4.0|There is no denying that Evanescence's debut album \\"Fallen\\" was one of the big suprises of 2003, continuing to sell strongly into 2004. The band has marched on without the departed co-founder and songwriter Ben Moody, seemingly without missing a beat.<br /><br />\\"Anywhere But Home\\" (14 songs; 61 min.) was recorded in late Spring, 2004, at Le Zenith in Paris, a great concert venue. What jumps out immediately is how tight the band sounds. It shows how quasi-nonstop touring pays off. Given that the band only has material from 1 album, it plays those same songs night after night. Amy Lee nevertheless manages to sound invigerated and at the top of her game on this album. Of course all 10 songs from \\"Fallen\\" are on here (with \\"My Immortal\\" the standout track). In addition, there is a very effective cover of Korn's \\"Thoughtless\\", as well as a couple of promising new songs, including \\"Missing\\" and \\"Breathe No More\\". The bonus DVD includes an at times hilarious \\"behind the scenes\\" look at the Paris show.<br /><br />This is a strong set, although one has to wonder the rationale behind releasing a live album after just one studio album! (Can you spell \\"m-o-n-e-y\\"?) Now we wait on new studio material from Evanescence. Hard to believe but soon it will be a full 2 years that \\"Fallen\\" was released. And then we will know whether Ben Moody really will be missed or not.
B00004ZD69|4.0|I think shiverneck hit the nail on the head when he said the second disk was amazing. It truly is. The reason being, I think, is that GYBE! gets down to business and talks a little about life instead of the anti-religious and political mumbo-jumbo. <br /> <br />dont get me wrong, i am pretty liberal and not religious, but i dont much like music that talks about politics and tries to make a point so blatantly. The beginning of Storm is pretty good, and so is the very end. But static is pretty terrible. <br /> <br />I like music about life. that delves into the little details and beauty. i cant describe it, but disc 2 is a must have. its filled with some of the most heartbreaking...and gorgeous music i have ever heard.
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 has aged very well as evidenced by this new disc.  Do not rely on Vertigo to set the tone however.  Those expecting similar high-energy rockers will find a very solid but milder collection of songs.  Maybe nostalgic memories of 1984 are coloring my opinion but I do not believe this is their best album yet.  U2's best has come and gone but this is far superior to 90% of the new music being released.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am not going to preach about this album you either love U2 or love to hate them. As a true fan I can honestly say this is definately one of their best outings right up there with Achtung, Unforgettable fire, etc. You won't be let down. ( I'd also like to let Pearl Jam's Lion know what a jackass he is, I am a huge Pearl Jam fan but knowing a moron like this is also a fan is very discomforting.  What difference does it make if your on the cover of Time magazine and you might want to get all your facts together before making an ignorant statement like that for your information the cover of Time magazine for April 27, 1987 featured none other than U2. Get over yourself and get a life.) <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|I don't want to add more than people said below. Music is iteresting, I feel it much better than ATYCLB. I just wanna understand, does 'cheap' CD includes lyrics within? Because if not - shame for U2 management. Stupidest decision I ever faced with:(
B0006399FS|3.0|I've listened to this album a whole bunch of times now.  My opinion has not changed.  It has not grown on me.  In fact, I like it a little less with each listen.    I have always loved U2's work.  I've loved every album, until now.  This album seems to me like a lazy effort, both in music and in lyrics.      There are no bad songs, but there is nothing special or exciting about this album.  It is like a rough draft.
B0006399FS|5.0|Most of the reviews that I have read are about how great U2 was with the Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and other past albums.  I thought this was suppossed to be for the latest album HTDAAB???  Lets just face it...U2 will never create an album like Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby...they are timeless and hardly ever happen for any band...Now to the new album HTDAAB is a great album!!! It has the same great U2 riffs, lyrics and ambience as past albums.  The album is more rock n roll then ATYCLB but not all songs are as loud as Vertigo.  I saw them under the Brooklyn Bridge the other day and heard many of the songs live and they sound great!!! The album is great and when compared to what is out there today (a lot of talentless garbage)  this album stacks up nicely!!! If you like U2's older sound with a mix of acoustic guitar and mellow sounds...this album is for you!!!
B000035Z1Z|3.0|While I have never been a fan of Meg Ryan, I find myself attracted to the films that she is in. Sometimes I just want to sit back and watch American romance comedies - they're usually so much fun. So I watched this, knowing I don't usually like her, hoping that maybe she could change my opinion of her. She didn't.<br /><br />Poor Kevin Kline. This movie could have been really exciting - a reunion with Jamie Lee Curtis would have been perfect - Curtis could have pulled this off with ease. Or how about Jennifer Aniston - a great comedic actress who has the skill for serious drama. But Ryan is just Ryan in this movie: I saw her Kate in \\"Kate and Leopold\\" and other Ryan major roles all surface in this flick... and was turned off as usual.<br /><br />There is a strange physical jaunt that she expels in many of the romantic comedies that she is in - in exasperation, she thrusts her arm into the air and bends slightly at the waist rocking back and forth, in an \\"Aw - sheesh - damn\\" kind of rhythm which is so trite and so unnecessary - that she throws at us again in this film. More than once. It is tiring, and too recognizable: why should I be reminded of \\"Kate and Leopold\\" or \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" every time I see Ryan?<br /><br />The story is fun and smart, the supporting cast is great. Everyone shines - especially Kevin Kline, whom I don't consider supporting cast, don't get me wrong. He is perfectly cast as the Franco-American with dreams as of yet beyond his grasp. He is sly and wise as a criminal, and gives us the benefit of the doubt throughout this movie. Jean Reno is perfect as his comrade-cum-official.<br /><br />This movie could have been so much more than it is. The French countryside is gorgeous, and you might just wish there was more to the leading lady to complement it.
B00063EMJ6|3.0|good collection...but no  sugar mountain  or powderfinger??? <br />are you kidding me?
B00005JMAH|4.0|the new Harry Potter is better for us adults- it's darker and sometimes the dark creatures. It's a great addition to the already well down Potter franchise.
B000669GAI|5.0|i know...i know...most of us pj fans already have all these songs  and some are missing...but isn't it easier to take one cd  on a road trip rather than 8?....
B00005JN7O|3.0|When I first saw the trailer for this, my eyes bulged from their sockets, my jaw unhinged and hung loosely in my lap. I'm a big fan of the old Superman cartoons of the 40's and 50's and this movie offered the best live action version of the type of nostalgia I crave. Fighter planes zipping through congested cities, battling skyscraper-tall robots that are control by a mad scientis. What more do you want.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story couldn't keep up with the visuals. While eye-candy can sustain a film for a short time, 106 minutes is too much to ask. At some point the plot has to kick in. I never cared about the characters and found the story so flat that I had forgotten most of it about an hour after I left the theater. Put another, it had absolute no inpact on me. A story has to have resonance, Sky Captain did not.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the overall picture, and am sad to say that this will probably not make it into my DVD collection.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|I still have the original record of this album. However,  <br />with the change in technology, I no longer listened to it. <br />For my last birthday, I asked my wife to get me the CD, <br />which she did. <br />I had forgotten how much I loved this album! Normally, <br />I listen to one or two tracks and skip the rest, but  <br />on this CD, I listen to each one and frequently sing along. <br />If you like ballads, and song with lyrics you can hear <br />and appreciate, you should love this album.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|i loved this film. i was amazed at how it was done. every part of it was done perfectly and it was flawless. i am sick and tired of these stupid teen horror and then shaun of the dead came along. this is the one movie you must see asap. also i suggest you see\\"saw\\". also a good movie for a true horror fan
B000069AUI|5.0|I've owned this album for a year and it never gets old. Every time I find my self singing along from start to finish. Martin's vocals are brilliant, compassionate yet pure. This album will never get old. Coldplay once again proves that the UK is the breeding ground for top notch musicians
B0002IVN9W|3.0|I started out liking this band but the more I listened the more I heard Talking Heads - particularly the male singer.  I don't know if through some genetic coincidence he really does sound like David Byrne or if he is just doing an impression but to me this detracts from the work.  I know many reading this either haven't heard the Talking Heads or view them as ancient history.  Personally, I always preferred the Talking Heads minus David (Tom Tom Club).  I think this band could be great but for now this reminds of me of how ridiculous the Velvet Underground sounded on demo tapes when Lou Reed was trying to mimic Bob Dylan's singing style.  Look what happened when he decided to be himself.
B000060P79|1.0|oh my god I love this band, they are so hot. I love they're punkish hairstyles and the way they dress. The music is awsome. IT's like the coolest cd I own besides Britney spears and good charlotte. The lyrics are like so deep, I almost cry. I'm a teenager too and I know how it feels when your parents yell at you and when you break up with your boyfriend and stuff.Damn my nail broke. Gotta go, American Idol is on. Simple Plan rocks!
B0006399FS|5.0|The best way I can explain why I like this album is to say that it is quintessentially U2. Edge's distinctive guitar sound, the unique subtlety of Larry and Adam's rock solid rhythm, and of course, Bono's vocals: everything you love about U2 is here. People who say this album isn't energetic don't get it. Energy is not about being loud, it's about having the balls to show sincerity and soul. And from one fan to another, I think the boys have done it again. Give it three listens and you'll love it as much as anything in your CD catalogue.
B000687M48|5.0|This CD is really awesome.It was so worth the wait.The best song on the CD is a toss-up between \\"Farther Away\\" or \\"Thoughtless\\".I really wish they would release all their songs from the other CDs and demos such as \\"Heart Shapped Box\\", \\"Anywhere\\", \\"Forgive me\\", and \\"So Close\\".Loved the CD so so much go out and bye it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
B0006399FS|4.0|This is a rock solid effort.  Similar to All That You Can't Leave Behind, maybe even better.  I'm a huge U2 fan, so they would have to really suck for me to give a bad review.  I think POP was their worst effort, and there's even a few songs on that I really like.     <br /> <br />I bought the super deluxe limited edition at a Target which comes with the dvd and the hardbound book.  I got the last one, but it's strictly for hard core fans.  The dvd is interesting enough, but one viewing is enough.  The book has lots of handwritten notes and doodles.  Frankly, it's often hard to decipher.  My biggest beef is the packaging of this super special edition.  There is no jewel box.  The dvd is stuck in an envelope in the book, and the cd is in this very thin paper board holder that does nothing to protect the cd itself from scratches.  Also, no song lyrics that I can find, unless it's in some of the illegible scriblings in the book.   <br /> <br />So don't cry in your beer if you can't find the super deluxe edition.  I wish I'd saved 20 bucks and just got the cd.  At least it has a jewel case.
B000099T2L|5.0|I am a destiny's Child Fan and I have always respected Beyounce for her vocals in the group. Don't get me wrong I love all of destiny child vocals. But Beyounce has always stuck out more to me. And she couldn't have shined any better then she did on Dangerously in love. The album is like that of a love story and is filled with mello R&B and Soul and mixed with vibrant hip hop beats that are aspired through different cultures.  I won't break down too much about each track  because this review could be a lot longer but rness I will break it down on a scale of    1-10. <br /> <br />Crazy in Love 10/10 <br /> <br />Naughty Girl  10/10 <br /> <br />Hip Hop Star  10/10 <br /> <br />Baby Boy      10/10 <br /> <br />I'D rather be with you 10/10 <br /> <br />Yes    10/10 <br /> <br />Me Mysef and I 10/10 <br /> <br />Speechless 10/10 &#60; Though I don't understand why everyone is giving it such a bad wrap, for me this was one of the songs that I felt Beyounce really shined through. <br /> <br />Dangerously in Love 10/10 <br /> <br />Closer I get to you 10/10 , This duet she did with Luther Vandross is another song that I feel Beyonce vocals showed so much growth. <br /> <br />That's how you like it &#60; This is only song I don't really listen to I tend to skip it, its the only song that dosn't really grab me right away. But because I haven't really listened to the song I cannot give a fair rating on it. <br />  <br />Gift From Virgo , &#60; Since its really not a song, but an interlude I feel that there is no need to rate it.  <br /> <br />Daddy 9/10 <br /> <br />So in conclusion I believe that Dangerlously in Love is an album that will be remembered and an album that one should have in his/her collection. And for all the haters that speak badly of the album all I can say is this.....If you don't like her or her music...please tell me...why did you buy the album again? <br />
B00005JLD4|5.0|In a time where movie producers are continuously trying to one-up each other with bigger-and-badder CGI spectacles, watching a film like this is refreshing. Completely stripped of pretension, prettiness, and unneccasary dribble, it is a story that speaks directly to the heart. Director Phillip Noyce (The Quiet American) and D.P. Christopher Doyle give us a vast and seemingly endless Australian desert landscape. In tune with the wonderfully placid score by Peter Gabriel, the results are hypnotic and compelling. There are stretches where very few lines of dialogue are spoken. The camera simply places these three young girls in the harshest reaches of the desert terrain, and we understand, if only slightly, what the real experience must have been like.  <br /> <br />The film tells a simple story of what it means to feel secure as a child and be with family. It also explores the effects of an age old racial stereotype that was then policy of the Australian government; Blacks must integrate and adjust to white society. And worse, Blacks are not able to raise their own children. It works because it does not trap itself inside a fixed and conventional narrative. Noyce explores his themes well, without throwing them in our faces as so many films regrettably do. We as the viewers are immersed into the journey across 1,500 miles of unforgiving desert, as the young girls try to outmaneuver the men sent to recapture them. <br /> <br />This is a beautiful film in its ability to captivate and move us in unexpected ways. The last few shots show us the two surviving sisters, now old and weak, and we hear Molly in voice-over tell us how their family is still being ruined by racial prejudice. We sympathize with them, of course. But we notice they are smiling, unwavering in their optimism and love of life. They lost a sister on their journey back home, and Molly lost her daughter for good. But something deep down in the heart tells them to keep going.  <br /> <br />
B00006879E|5.0|Really great cd. I have purchased so many bad cds with only 1 good song before....BUT THIS CD ROCKS! Not a single bad song.
1592400876|5.0|I just finished reading Lynne Truss's fantastic book, Eats, Shoots, and Leaves. While many of my writer friends have said they won't read it because \\"I don't need any more grammer and punctuation lessons, thank you very much,\\" it is NOT just a book on proper punctuation or grammar. It IS a humorous look at how the English language has evolved over the centuries, and the origins of some of our modern day punctuation. You may be surprised by the things you learn, as well as being thoroughly entertained by Ms. Truss's wonderfully acerbic wit. There's nothing like Brit-humour to get me snorting through my nose with laughter on the bus!
B00068IOWC|2.0|Ugh. I feel cheated. I think it's great that previous reviewers have taken the time to analyze each song-I just can't. After listening to this album all the way through, I'm left with a feeling of nostalgia for the i-pod commercials and the sense of anticipation and energy that they gave me. While the times we live in may be bleak at the moment, I expected something that would lift me up and make me feel more hopeful about the future.<br /><br />Maybe even something to dance to. Politically these guys have my heart, but so did the Clash once upon a time. Difference being they didn't dress their musical observations about the state of the world in bombastic over-produced ballady twaddle. Geez-I'd even go for a re-mix of \\"I Will Follow\\" at this point. At least the xylophone was perky. The DVD-yeah, OK thanks. 2 songs endlessly done from different angles does not make for compelling viewing. Drat-as I'm writing this that i-pod commercial is on again. Today was *not* a beautiful day.
B00068IOWM|5.0|My Box set showed up today - shipped yesterday.  I was a little worried after reading discussions about \\"Fast Cars\\" and seeing it was not listed in this items description. <br />Be assured - the song is on there. <br /> <br />The CD is tremendous - my favorites are Vertigo, Love & Peace or Else, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. <br /> <br />Highly recommend this item - you won't be disappointed!
0671015206|5.0|Unless you were born into family wealth and privilege, you have two options: 1. You can look like a millionaire.  2. You can one day BE a millionaire.  I know which one I choose. <br /> <br />It will perhaps be a revelation to many people to discover that the folks who drive the fanciest cars, live in the most chi-chi neighborhoods in the ritziest homes, and who refuse to shop anywhere but Neiman-Marcus are usually cash-poor.  They may even have negative net worth, due to their huge pile of consumer debt.  But the family down the block from you?  You know...the ones in the 3-bedroom, 1900-sq. ft. house, driving the 8 year old Corolla?  The ones you wait in line with at Target?  They're millionaires. <br /> <br />I find it interesting that the negative reviewers of this very useful and practical guide all seem to say the same thing: \\"You can't possibly enjoy your life if you save some of the money you earn instead of spending it all!\\"  Unwittingly, they serve as the perfect illustration of the UAWs (Under-Accumulators of Wealth) mentioned in the book.  UAWs may earn very high salaries, but they are also so obsessed with collecting status symbols (huge McMansions, swimming pools, country club memberships, new $50,000 cars every two years, etc.) that they are constantly strapped for cash.  Case in point: \\"Dr. North\\" (or was it Dr. South?), a physician mentioned in the book.  Dr. N. has an incredibly successful practice and, in his late 50s, makes $700,000 per year.  His net worth?  Barely half of his yearly salary!  And most of that is in home equity. <br /> <br />PAWs (Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth), on the other hand, follow a few simple rules: they \\"pay themselves first\\" (ie: save a set amount of money every month rather than waiting to have enough left over to begin saving someday in the future); they don't purchase something until they can afford it, rather than assuming that \\"one day I'll have the money, so I may as well buy this on credit now\\"; and perhaps most importantly, they don't allow themselves to get caught up into the escalating madness of keeping up with the Joneses.  True wealth doesn't lie in having whatever you want; it's wanting whatever you have.   <br /> <br />Unless you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you probably can't afford to live the way you assume millionaires live and still actually become a millionaire yourself.  Think about it - if a guy making $700K per year isn't a millionaire because of his spending habits, what chance do the rest of us have?  On the other hand, if you make a good salary (say $45K and up), are prudent, and follow some of the basic guidelines for building wealth, you have an excellent shot at one day actually BEING a millionaire - even if you don't look like one. <br />
B000002KB8|5.0|I want to say up front that I don't specifically recommend that you purchase this album: If you're metal fan I'd dare say that you are virutally obligated to own their Black Box set, which naturally contains this album.  However, for my own personal amusement I will write a review for this album in particular.<br /><br />This album marks the birth of Metal, no doubt about it.  However, I can't quite say that it's a metal album, as there's a bit too much blues jamming and whatnot. Still, the title track and N.I.B. are pure, unadulterated metal.  And, I rather enjoy the jamming and other non and pre-metal aspects of the album, and think it is definitely a bit underrated in the Black Sabbath canon.(I don't think it's as good as Paranoid, MoR or Sabotage, but I think it comes closer than most people seem to feel)<br /><br />You've got to have heard a good portion of this album, but I'll go over it all anyway.  The title track, is an utter classic, and as good as your slow, ominous metal song can get. Ozzy's barely controlled vox are used to perfect effect, and the lyrics aren't quite silly enough to weaken the whole song(The faster riffing at the end is pretty sweet too.)  The Wizard is underrated, perhaps the best song on the album.  Iommi's stuttering, start and stop rhythm guitar work is simply awesome, and the loose, snare-riding drumming underneath it compliments it perfectly.  Behind the Wall of Sleep and Bassically are a fine introduction to the next all-time classic, the legendary N.I.B.  The main riff is utterly classic, but it's the smoother, more melodic guitar lines that are thrown in later that really hold the song together, and the sharp, slick lead work.  Ozzy's vox again fit in perfectly, once again.(Ozzy has a very limited range.  It's amazing that they used it so effectively on this album) Second best track on the album.  Wicked World is pretty strong too, with more blues in it and a fairly jazzy feel at times.  It's definitely good, but not in the league of the first 3 tracks..  Track 5, which I'll simply refer to as Warning, for simplicity's sake, is another classic.  The jamming is quite entertaining, but I absolutely love the main parts of the song.  The chorus is very memorable, one of the best they'd ever written.  And the introduction is very nice and moody as well.  Evil Woman is the only weakpoint in the album.  It's just kinda blah.  Still, it's not terrible, and the rest of the album is strong enough to make up for it, easily.<br /><br />Yes, this rules.  Get the Black Box now!league of the first 3 tracks..

B000002KKS|5.0|Heaven and Hell, a model Black Sabbath album, gives Ronnie James Dio a strong stance with the band. Song reviews: Neon Knights: Super fast with an entergetic rhythm. The song hows that Dio's songwriting involves a lot of fantasy, unlike the dark songs that the earlier band was known for. A little short compared to many other Sabbath songs, but still satisfying. Great playing by Geezer. 4/5. Children of the Sea: I have to say, this song isn't nearly the best, but still great. the speed, although Geezer's guitar is heavy, nothing is done to bump up the pace. 3/5 and a half. Lady Evil: Pretty good song. superb rhythm by Geezer and Iommi in the intro, medium speed throughout the song. 4/5. Heaven and Hell: Very strong song, great vocals by Dio. Pretty slow at first, but the pace accelerates towards the end, great lyrics. 5/5! Wishing Well: Would probably get a 4/5, except the lyrics and the song are a tad boring. Great solo by Iommi that just seems to swirl around in your head. 3/5 and a half. Die Young: Easily the best song on the album. sounds remniscent of the end of Heaven and Hell though. Walk Away: Not too good. what else can I say? 2/5 and a half. Lonely is the Word: Heavy guitar, but way to slow. one of those strange \\"romance\\" songs like Walk Away, not what fans are used to, some repetitive guitar. 3/4. Overview: Great album despite the shortcomings.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Growing up in San Diego I saw Green Day a number of times in concert before Dookie came out and owned their earlier albums as well.  They were a special band at that time in California because few Punk acts around could match their live performances or the quality of their songwriting.  Dookie's success completely blind sided me when it came out but it was well deserved. They prove the old saying that it doesn't matter what genre a band comes from, all that matters is writing good songs that connect with the listener.  Green Day always achieved these goals and they built a huge regional following because of it.<br /><br />They pretty much stayed in one place musically with Insomniac and Nimrod though Warning was a real step forward in the growth department.  With American Idiot Green Day have released their true masterpiece and I am stunned that they did it so late in the game.  In an era where most bands get dropped by their fans after two albums its hard for most acts to stick around long enough to reach this type of zenith and few even if given the chance to do so can use this added time wisely.<br /><br />I was like a previous reviewer who bought it along with some other releases and ended up listening to it non stop from that point on.  The single American Idiot does not reflect the overall brilliance that the rest of this album contains.  As a concept album it works suprisingly well though you can listen to it without feeling that some of the songs serve only as filler.  Nothing is wasted on this release.  Some have commented that concept albums have been done before and Punk is hardly new but lets face it, Rock as a whole is roughly 50 years old now and there are only so many things you can do with a guitar, bass and drums.  What matters, again, is whether an artist can write good songs and few are writing them better than Billie Joe Armstrong is on this release.<br /><br />It's ultimately an album that combines the best of what they offered on their previous releases but stands on its own as a master stroke of genius that only the most cynical could deny.  I don't know how they did it but they did and we are all richly rewarded because of it.<br /><br />Stand Out Tracks:<br /><br />American Idiot<br /><br />Holiday<br /><br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams<br /><br />Give Me Novacaine<br /><br />Extraordinary Girl<br /><br />Letterbombprevious releases but stands on its own as a master stroke of genius that only the most cynical could deny.

B0006399FS|4.0|Reading all of these reviews is disheartening because many people are starting to criticize this great band for making commercials and promoting themselves when there is nothing wrong with that.  Bono is egomanical, his lyrics are far from subtle, and we love that about him. The Edge's guitar parts are familiar but always fresh enough to keep you wanting more, and the band is far from finished by the sound of this CD.  Its more of an extension from All That You Can't Leave Behind, rather than a rehash.  Its stronger and more confident than ATYCB, and the band seems to be having more fun rather than worrying about recapturing something that they lost with Zooropa and Pop.  They know what they do best and damn do they do it well.  The songs are definitely catchy (especially Vertigo, All Because of You, Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own) and for anyone to say otherwise is to be listening with a skeptics ear towards a band that has managed to remain as the most popular in the world for 25 years!  If they have to make a commercial or two or sell an Ipod to make sure that people are still listening, then that's fine with me as long as the music is still this good.  Buy the CD, you won't be disappointed and you may even be surprised at how good it really is.
B0006399FS|5.0|The songs are sometimes moving, sometimes heart-wrenching, sometimes magical, but always good. The music is like it's from another planet, the lyrics are poetic and uplifting. Excellent album, as a whole. A great gift. Life-changing. <br /> <br />BUY IT!
B0006399FS|5.0|Okay, Okay, I am a looong time fan, however, listening to this cd just reinforced why I love this band so much.  All throughout was the \\"U2 sound\\" as I call it, and it was wonderful!  I really love Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own and Man and a Woman.  The whole cd rocked!  If you are a U2 fan, don't let this one pass by.  If you are unsure about U2, don't let this one pass you by.  As a matter of fact, even if you don't think you like U2, don't let this one by.  It's that good.  They took a risk with POP and I think it backfired a little, so with this cd, I feel they went back to their original sound.  You will get the true sound of U2 with a little modern stuff mixed in.  When I was listening to a few songs, I heard resemblances to \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" from Joshua Tree and also a few songs from Rattle and Hum and War.  Definitely a great one to try.  U2's talent is clear.  They are unmatched.
1577312082|5.0|By all means, read the comments of the critics. Interestingly enough, they make the argument FOR the Power of Now much better than I can. The critics operate from a conceptual premise to analyze the idea of being present. Tolle believes that Presence is devoid of thought. You cannot understand Presence in a theoretical sense; to be Present you must be Present. <br /> <br />  NOte: When I refer to 'Critics' I'm categorizing all of us who have at some time, had or used predispositions and prejudices (pre-judgments) with regard to anything in our lives: people, places, things and ideas.  <br /> <br />  The mind based arguments are inherently flawed because they are logically founded and thereby naturally inclined to fight against being present. Simply, when you are Present there is no argument.   This is the beauty of Tolle's book. Tolle is not a philospher (because then his teachings would be merely theoretical) but he points you in the direction to be free of the useless, often debilitating, chatter of the mind.  <br />Tolle seems to believe that with just the optimal use of your senses you are Present. What else is there. Certainly, not the past or future.  <br /> <br />   The Critics Weaknesses. <br />1) The critics need to make Tolle wrong. That is nothing more than the egoic, self righteous mind which is threatened. The egoic mind rallies to stave off any attempt to be free of self importance. <br />2) The critics are caught up in the importance of their argument  and words. Tolle uses words merely as signposts; the words in and of themselves are unimportant. They are only tools used for direction.  <br />3) Apple Pie Analogy. Essentially, the critics, being mind based, experience an apple pie with predispositions and prejudices (pre-judgments) about how the pie should taste. They will spoil the experience by arguing what you need more of, less of, taste, color and size. They will not experience the apple pie as it IS. Hence, the mind contaminates the Present moment. Tolle suggests that the \\"Present\\" person will have an inner body experience with all sensory perceptions: taste, smells, textures, chewing, swallowing, etc.   <br /> <br />While we, as critics, may be on a mission to 'search' for the \\"Truth\\", unfortunately, our analytical mind seeks to destroy the 'essence' of our being. And you need only ask yourself if you are at Peace. If not, then why would heed the advice of a critic who obviously is caught up in mental warefare and is also not at peace. The book in excellent, and if nothing else, it is provocative and non-threatening. Enjoy! Pete.
B0002KP5FI|5.0|I knew Nicola Conte from his bossa & DJ-stuff and was curious to hear what this album would bring, since no electronics were used. I was positively suprised! This is not crossover electronic sci-fi jazz, but real acoustic jazz with great lyrical melodies, very good solo's and fine vocals, all performed by a bunch of very talented musicians. It's an uptemo album, but it has enough space and openness in it which makes it easy to grab, but interesting enough for the long term. Of course it still has the natural bossa-feel Nicola is known for. <br /> <br />If you like f.i. Koop (Waltz for Koop) then this certainly is a record for you.
B0006399FS|5.0|The album is great!! Every song is very good, the lyrics are awesome and U2 proves again that reinventing is not matter of changing styles or looking for something really fancy, Is going back to the original sound and style of the band. U2 did that in this great piece of work is a CD you must have, and of course if your a fan is something worth the waiting. There's great songs such as: Vertigo, miracle drug, one step closer, crumbs from your table, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, city of blinding lights, love and peace or else. Great performances of Edge (with those guitar chords that are unique from him), Adam(still proving he is one of the best bass players in the world), Adam(his drum beats are the best), and of course the voice of Bono that nobody is able to imitate.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Most of the people that are giving, say 1 or 2 stars, are expecting this album to be like I&W and Scenes, but that is such a terrible assumption... DT is about progression.. thats why they have survived all these years. Also, one thing with virtually ALL prog... you cannot judge an album at the first or second listen... once you *know* the songs its a totally different story, you can appreciate the music much better. When I first heard Dream Theater, it did virtually nothing for me (except metropolis pt.1 suprisingly), but after putting these songs on while I was doing stuff, i gradually began to like their stuff, and that is what's great about dream theater, once you know their stuff, you like them... (i have sooo many examples of people I know likeing DT after listening to them for a while) ...if not, even after tonnes of listening... then prog isnt for you. But this album, while not their best by any account, just explores a different side of the band, which you can appreciate given time. There are some great songs on here, my favs are honor thy father and endless sacrifice... I'll give is 4/5... but bear in mind that this album will blow most albums away, and 4/5 is just compared to other similar prog albums. But remember, dont say its trash after listening to it once, give it a chance to grow on you, then you will see, that you will find a whole new experience of music.. i know I did.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Journey 2001 DVD is awesome!  The quality is clear & crisp.  The concert is superb.  The band just gets better and better!  The chemistry of the current line-up is like watching brothers and best friends having a lot of fun together on stage.  <br /> <br />I love watching Steve Augeri's performance.  His singing of the classics that we all love is perfection.  It is obvious that he loves and respects the music.  I also noticed Steve Augeri's connection with the audience.  They love him and he loves his audience.  His dance moves are so smooth.  I love watching his performance. He is the perfect frontman for Journey. <br /> <br />Journey 2001 DVD is a must have for anyone who loves Journey ~ who are discovering Journey for the first time or rediscovering Journey again.  Two thumbs up!!!
B00005JMXX|5.0|Just a little comment to all the writers that said that this is a movie for ignorants: This is a science fiction movie! and you are not watching Discovery Channel. Please focus and place comments on true based histories (and DVD's only) and let the people to enjoy their science fiction fantasies. <br />Thanks for your time.
6305696071|5.0|Only God knows how many times that I have watched this movie. I don't think that I will ever grow tired of it. Yes it is the same story as Cinderella but a modern day one. But still every bit as much of a classic. It's every woman's dream come true.  The beautiful Julia Roberts is swept off of her feet by the rich Richard Gere.
B0006399FS|4.0|You know, it amazes me that so many people are down on this album.  People keep expecting U2 to reinvent themselves again, but they have to realize that these guys are in their mid-forties and are winding down their career. I don't know what people want from U2.     This album is as passionate as anything they've ever done.  At this stage of their career, they're in solidification mode, which is fine.  People should accept this for what it is - a very solid album, and a gift, really, because they could have retired a long time ago.
B00000IQW3|4.0|THE LAST STARFIGHTER is definitely a product of the 1980s. The hair, some of the clothes, the video arcades, the cars, etc. Despite the time period in which it is set, it does a wonderful job of tying in to everything that's great about youth and the optimism of coming of age.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Alex Rogan (Lance Guest). Alex is a young kid living in a trailer park who dreams of bigger things and unlike many of those at home, is trying to pursue those dreams. He wants to go to college away from home and begin a new life. Only thing is, he gets rejected from the school he applies to. So Alex starts playing the arade. The trailer park has one arcade game outside of its little country store and Alex is a pro at it. The game is called Starfighter and one night Alex ends up beating the game and achieving an all time new high score.  The next day a man named Centauri who claims to be a representative of the company who invented the game shows up to meet with Alex. Turns out, Centauri is an alien who invented the game to find new recruits to join the Star League, an elite group of starfighters who keep the peace throughout the galaxy. Centauri takes Alex to Star League command and he is given a whirlwind tour. The situation is overwhelming for the lad and he requests to be sent home. He does, but by then things have gotten way out of hand and before Alex can say Beta, he finds out that he's the last starfighter.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is good, especially for a cheesy 1980s sci-fi, boy in space picture.  Robert Preston made his final motion picture performance in THE LAST STARFIGHTER and watching some of the behind the scenes stuff on the DVD it's clear that the man was much more talented than many people ever gave him credit for.  The special effects in THE LAST STARFIGHTER might seem lame by todays standards but they really aren't all that bad. TRON is recognized as being the first movie to use CGI, but it was THE LAST STARFIGHTER that first used CGI for all its special effects. The effects were produed by the now-ancient Cray Super Computer.<br /><br />The movie actually is a joy to watch. It's got some snappy dialogue, some interesting concepts (the whole Beta thing), and the first feature length CGI effects in a major motion picture. The film isn't going to change anyone's life, but it is a great movie to sit back and watch at home with a cool Dr Pepper and a bucket full of buttered popcorn. A delightful piece of mind candy that speaks to child in all of us.<br /><br />The DVD special features include the director commentary, a behind the scenes featurette, production photos and info, and theatrical trailers.all its special effects.

B00068IOWC|4.0|all right so ive been looking forward to this album for years now and i went out to buy it this evening at 9pm. to my luck, it was sold out at best buy and circuit city! this album along with gwen stefanis new cd were flying off the shevles and with good reason. i finally got it on my third try and dont regret it at all. i love the song \\"Vertigo\\" and the others are good as well. my favorite u2 album is \\"all that you cant leave behind\\" but dont hesistate buying this album. its u2 after all!
B0006399FS|5.0|The songs are really good, I'd like to prattle on and on about how they strike a chord, but i'll leave you to decide that. I've grown up listening to U2, and find the older songs much more endearing than anything in recent years, but this album makes a good addition to those old numbers. <br />here's a track by track breakdown <br /> <br />Vertigo : Reminscent of Zoo tv..the first song in achtung baby, typical u2 rock <br /> <br />Miracle Drug : Really well done piece. has a really nice start...guitars with orchestra and keyboard..i really loved this. <br /> <br />Sometimes you can't make it on your own : See above. really nice as well, i think these two songs stand out, very heartfelt and entirely devoid of the tedium and plasticity that dogged the All That You Can't Leave Behind album(with the exception of Beautiful Day). <br /> <br />Love and Peace or else : Might take some getting used to, verses are bleh, chorus is good, didn't make as much as an impact as the  2nd and 3rd tracks. Think of \\"Until the end of the World\\" on achtung baby, and you'll know what i mean. <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights : Very nice blend of keyboards and guitar, i guess this is what they're really good at and should stick to, instead of making disastrous forays into pseudo-electronica like they did with Pop <br /> <br />All because of you : Too noisy for me to appreciate fully.Desire-esque <br /> <br />Man and Woman : For some reason this sounds a lot like staring at the sun plus a beat, especially the beginning..with the guitars, decent song. <br /> <br />Crumbs from your Table: A little bland.  <br /> <br />One Step Closer: Quiet, almost atmospheric piece like Mothers of the Disappeared, although not as depressing.  <br /> <br />Origin of the Species : Didn't make an impact really, maybe with a few more listens... <br /> <br />Yahweh : Great finish, but i find myself going back to 2 and 3 again and again, they simply overshadow everything else in my opinion. <br /> <br />on a final note, pop took me a long time to get used to, all that you can't leave behind didn't really make an impact, it was kind of like sitting drowsily on a hot summer afternoon...everything was tepid, this album however actually invokes some emotions, like the old ones used to, they may not stand up to the likes of with or without you, or where the streets have no name, but they definitely come close, and is the best new album i've heard in a year or so. His voice sounds good, but there is a general feeling of age, not only physical, but more an intellectual maturity that's evolved over the years and has culminated in a piece of work that's a very effective, sobering mood-lifter. <br />I'd give it 5 stars as it's definitely well worth the money paid for it.
B0006399FS|4.0|I'll keep this short and simple.  If you liked ATYCLB, then you probably will like this album.  If you think the song Vertigo is awesome, then you may not like the rest of the album.  If you like mellow pop music, then you probably will like this album.   <br /> <br />I wish everyone on here would stop bitching and whining that U2 isn't as good as they used to be.  Shut up.  This is a good album that has a good message.  It isn't for everyone, so what.  You can make some people happy all the time, or all the people happy some of the time.   <br /> <br />I will say this though.  They way over marketed this album.  How many times do I need to see the ipod commercial.  Usually, too much hype leads to bitching and whining by the masses.  You can't tell the world you are reinventing bread, when really you are just adjusting the recipe.  Your bread is guaranteed not to meet the expectations. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|...U2 will never again make albums like Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. That's all there is to it. But there is something comforting and familiar in this cd, just as there was with their last. It's no classic, and fans attending their upcoming tour will be more interested in hearing the older songs, but this CD is definitely worth listening to. It's very mellow and filled with songs of love and spirituality moreso than songs of war and politics. Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own is by far the best song on the CD and an instant classic. When compared to other albums on the Billboard charts right now, this one will blow most of them out of the water. But as far as core U2 fans are concerned; this one will probably rank right next to All That You Can't Leave Behind. Whether that be a good or bad thing, you decide.
B00005ALP6|4.0|I have always liked musicals, and I especially liked this one. Even though I liked the book better, the musical has many acting scenes in which many characters sing. The singing part of the musical is a key factor that contributes and complements many parts of the play written by Shaw. Even though the reader has more space to imagine each character and situation in the play, the musical exposes the settings and the actors just as a similar as Shaw would have wanted. Despite this, it is necessary to state that Shaw's criticism is most likely to impact the reader more profoundly than what the musical would. I say so because the music involves singing well and having a nice voice, which might have put into second plan the true intentions of Pygmalion. In addition, I believe that the director of My Fair Lady made his own interpretation, which could have emphasized certain aspects that Shaw did not take seriously into account when writing his master piece. An example of this is the character Freddy. In the play, Freddy is portrayed a low class \\"gentleman\\" who has no talents at all; However, in the musical Freddy is shown as a high class person which is very concerned about him and his surroundings. Considering that the musical had slight modifications to the play, which is totally untreatable, I have to agree that having read the book and watched the movie, helped me to appreciate Pygmalion and  all the critics found in it. Because the movie portrays a specific perspective of the play, and the Pygmalion another one, I obtained  more knowledge about Shaw's point of view and about his complex personality. <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|Jetisoning director Chris Columbus for Mexican auteur Alfonso Cuaron, the money hungry minds behind the Potter films have shown a stroke of genius.  Cuaron, best known for the sexually charged \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\" and the quiet children's fantasy \\"A Little Princess,\\" proves he is up to the Potter challenge.  By focusing more on the charcters we came to know and love from J.K. Rowling's luminous novels instead of just creating aesthetics and extraneous plot details, Cuaron brings Harry's world to vigourous life inways the first two films could never do.  Golden light has been replaced by darker shades of black and blue, stiff cinemaography supplanted by assured motion and top-heavy storytelling be damned.  Cuaron knows how to tell a tale with nuance and emotion. <br /> <br />\\"Azkaban\\" picks up the summer after the events of \\"The Chamber of Secrets,\\" with Harry heading back to school with chums Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) all amid dread that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a former follower of Lord Voledmort has escaped from Azkaban prison.  Seeking shelter under the benevolent gaze of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), Harry hopes atleast one year will go by without a fuss.  But soon wicked Dementors occupy Hogwartz, thinking Black will try to kill Harry for thwarting his former master.  The Dementors are black wonders of CGI, sort of floating Ringwraiths with a putrid, soul-sucking breath.  Dread creeps into Hogwartz, but everyone tries to get along, but of course evil events are sure to come, and they do in a whirlwind of astonishing visual effects and equally astonishing story-telling.  The cast has never seemed more at home in their roles, and the young cast leads the charge by blossoming into full-blown adolescence.  Daniel Radcliffe is quickly making Harry his own, Emma Watson is becoming a babe and Rupert Grint gets the best lines.  But the real star is Cuaron, who makes the Potter universe feel alive and vigorous.  It will be hard forMike Newell to top with \\"The Goblet of Fire.\\"
B000687M48|3.0|As much as the fans hate to hear this, it's the truth: Evanescence isn't a good band.  They're mediocore musicians, and I feel that their only saving grace is Amy Lee's voice.  I bought this cd a while ago, when I was still a teeny, and I was even disappointed then.  It only has three \\"previously unreleased\\" songs, which are easily downloaded for a lot less.    If you really want to buy a cd, see Lacuna Coil.  Anyone with half a mind can see that Evanescence stole from them.
B000084T18|2.0|i bought this album after hearing 'in da club'. <br />in all honesty i thought the album was ok, my best track being 'if i can't' but there is too much on this album that goes on about the same things, like: <br />' i've been shot god knows how many times''  <br />'i've been stabbed so many times' <br />'i'm a p.i.m.p' <br />it gets very boring after a while. <br />and to comment on the beef between 50 and ja, all i have to say is that i think jarule is a major talent and surpasses 50 in everyway. i was lucky enough 2 go and see ja in concert in 2002 after the release of 'pain is love' ( it was lucky as the tickets sold out in a few hours) and it was the best rap concert i have ever been to. A year later 50 does a concert in the same arena (manchester evening news arena) and even though i didn't go to it, i heard that it was a whole waste of money and all it was, was him and all his entourage on stage shouting their songs, without really giving a performance, whereas ja did give an outstanding performance. <br />so 2 conclude 'coz i think i have gone on for a bit now. <br />'get rich or dye tryin' is an ok album but, give me a jarule album instead of 50 cent to add to my collection instaed
B00068IOWM|1.0|Dont get me wrong, i like u2, but the current hype of this album ruined it for me. its not that i have anything against pop music, i just hate the system: rehash a song so much that people strain at the sound of it, and then never play it again for a long long time and then slap the tag 'old' on it.<br /><br />I just bought the collectors edition today and i must say i love the artwork and i appreciate not having to look at that god awful album cover of 'the boys' sittin' down. note: the artwork in the artbook is just paintings and drawings. i like this kind of thing because it lets you see into the mind of the artists with their handwriting and little sketches. it is common to have this sort of artwork on an indie album. now to the point: the only u2 album i have ever like upon first hearing is october. every other album (including joshua tree) took much much time to grow on me, as is with most almost every band. but so far it receives only 1 star because about 70% of the album just sounds like is missing that sparkle, or sounds sort of like a song theyve done before. you would think this would be a good thing but listen to 'crumbs from your table' and you will hear the edge play the EXACT same guitar line he played in 'walk on' from their last album (the guitar part is near the end of walk on). this is a shame considering crumbs is probably one of the best songs on the album so far, with a killer intro. i like the fast cars song, it sounds sort-of  world musicish but with a u2 twist. i also like vertigo, mainly because i tried to avoid the song whenever it came on so that it wouldnt grow stale to me. and all because of you is good too. so far thats it: 4 songs out of 12. do i smell a zooropa? (please! zooropa sucked the big one). ok im just messing around now. this album could get better with time i admit. i just hope that it really does get good because i enjoy u2's music.<br /><br />[EDIT] ok after a good day's listen and after watching the dvd, i have more respect for the songs. one in particular, sometimes you cant make it on your own: if you watch the documentary on the dvd, the edge will explain the history of the song; how it went from basic major chords to augmented and then with a suggestion from bono it went to what it is now. i think it sounds pretty good on piano with the edge singing it in my opinion. and i also like love and peace or else-with its drum machine and heavy buzzing guitar intro. the minor scale works nicely on this one. it sort of sounds bluesy but with that modern heavy rock aspect; full sounding. ok now 50% of the album is good. that is better than i can say for most albums so now i give it a 3. it could grow on me more with time though...
B0006399FS|5.0|Over the past 20+ years we've heard U2 play all kinds of music (well, except hip-hop), and one interesting anti-trend that they set, if you will, is that they are musical iconoclasts.  Take their gritty and political breakthrough album War, which contrasts with the 80's mainstream rock trend of hairbands and synthesizers.  Then comes the age of grunge, and they turn around to make Achtung Baby.  Now, in the days of popular \\"hard\\" rock sounds that consists of pretentious edginess and high-decibel noise, here comes U2 with another Atomic Bomb. <br /> <br />I've heard many people complain that the CD in its entirety is not represented by their first single and the opening track, Vertigo.  My feeling is, so what?  The songs are seamlessly bound together lyrically and thematically, and many of the tracks past Vertigo are on par or even better.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is the best song in the album, with amazing writing and heartbreaking vocal performance, especially when understood in the context of the death of Bono's father Bob Hewson a few years ago. <br /> <br />Overall it's a great album.  I'm not putting it up there with Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree right away, but it's getting better and better every time I listen to it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay First of all I must give praise to Evanescence for finally bringing some refreshing sounds to my airwaves!!!! I know alot of you guys out there wouldn't possibly bring yourself to like Evanescence because the lead singer is a GIRL. Yeah there are alot of other bands out there that do the same kind of music. The pluck is, while your music making is one thing, you have to have the personality and the artistry to connect with audiences, which Amy Lee and Evanescence do with unmatched quality. I myself am mostly a Hip Hop or Rap fan, as are most of my friends. But Evanescence has certainly changed all that. Me and my friends alike have become MEGA MEGA Evanescence fans. <br />The music is classically driven with Strings, piano and a blend of metal that other bands just can't match. Kudos to Evanescence for bringing there music to the world. This Album is one of a kind! Every song on this CD is remarkable. Im looking forward to more Cd's from them
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is without a doubt U2's best work since 1991's Achtung Baby. However, I would liken it more to their even earlier masterpiece-1987's The Joshua Tree- in that it is a consistent album of solid songs but also contains some singularly powerful singles. Their last album, 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind, was an exciting change of direction for the band (who were still rebounding from the disappointment of 1997's Pop) with some truly memorable moments (Beautiful Day, Walk On, In a Little While...) but was ultimately disappointing in it's ability to play repeatedly over the years as so many U2 greats have. This new album, however, has that strange and truly gratifying feeling of being both completely fresh and new and feeling like it's always been there in the back of your head. Maybe that's because it so seamlessly combines old and new styles. The Edge is back in his glorious bombastic form, and it sounds like he's been anxiously awaiting the return as he is definetely the star of this show. His signature guitar chime from the 80's hasn't been employed this much since...the 80's, and it sounds better than ever! Songs like \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" scream classic U2. In fact, \\"City..' has a structure similar to the perrenial classic \\"Where the Streets Have no Name,\\" right down to the minute-and-a-half guitar intro. The highlights of this great disc include \\"City...\\", \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" (which has a particularly profound meaning in my life at the moment), \\"Crumbs...,\\"\\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own,\\"\\"Miracle Drug,\\" and \\"Love and Peace or Else!\\" That being said, the whole album is good and listenable all the way through. My initial reaction to the album as a long-time fan anxiously awaiting it (as I have with all their past efforts) was sheer joy to the fact that I never truly thought I would here songs of this quality and energy from this group again, although it's not a complete return to form in terms of styling, just energy and substance. And while their best work is still probably behind them (It's hard to top The Joshua Tree after all and nearly impossible to top Achtung Baby), it's very refreshing and reassuring to have music this strong from a band this consistently relevant. U2 have always been reliable, but this Bomb is surprisingly potent!
067144901X|5.0|My 8 month old baby was given this book recently, and she just loves it. She enjoys it so much, she will let me read it to her again and again. She just sits and smiles at the animal sounds. It really grabs her attention. She's able to focus on the pictures and sounds, so it's a great introduction to books and reading. This is a great beginning book for parents to read to their babies.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This is a Greatest Hits well done.  Including all the single cuts release to radio outlets.  Usually Record Label do not place one single so you still buy the original records and the greatest hits, wich really anoys me.  Although The Cranberries music career it's better heard on their original conceptual records than a Greatest Hits Package, this cd will do very well for those casual fans of the irish band.   The fans will find delightful that they include a non-release cut from theit NO NEED TO ARGUE album, DAFFODIL LAMENT, wich in my opinion is one of the bands best tracks.   Worth your money.  Buy It.
0060589272|5.0|So far, this is the best book i have read about sex,love making, and real life fears and doubts about love between a man & a woman. More than a novel, is a book that will help you face your real you, your wantings, your desires, your fears, your hopes about love & sex. A must read!!!!!!
B0006399FS|4.0|i have heard it over & over, this CD is reminiscent of \\"joshua tree\\" and really..it's quite true; yet with a fresh touch.  <br /> <br />anyone who writes it off as 1 or 2 stars were probably babies when the classics came out, so these folks most likely think \\"achtung baby\\" sets the standard. but U2 were never about simple pop songs, rather time-less masterpieces. buy it!
B0006399FS|5.0|Like a lot of U2 fans (and rock fans in general), I've been waiting a long time for this album ... more than 2 1/2 years. Was it worth the wait? I've spun the CD five times now and can say yes, yes, and yes -- it's the best album U2 have yet produced. <br /> <br />I'll paraphrase another reviewer who called HTDAAB the offspring of Achtung Baby and The Joshua Tree; it is all that and more, but it surpasses even those classic albums with its astonishing heart and musical passion. Bono's lyrics and singing aside, this disc contains some GREAT music. The Edge's guitar is like a combination chainsaw/machine-gun, and Larry and Adam of course provide mesmerizing rhythm. <br /> <br />\\"Atomic Bomb\\" is miles ahead of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" that much should go without saying. There isn't a single bit of dead weight anywhere on the record, though it's definitely an ALBUM. You should sit down, free yourself of distractions, maybe light a candle and pop open a cold beer, and just ENJOY, at top volume. This is an album to grow old with. <br /> <br />A song-by-song run-through: <br />Vertigo: A solid rocker and a great arena anthem, though it's easily the least song on the album. Best line: \\"The girl with crimson nails/has Jesus round her neck/swinging to the music.\\" <br />Miracle Drug: Took me a couple of turns to switch onto this track, but it's a great U2 song, full of heart and emotion, with a strong solo from The Edge. Best line: \\"Of science and the human heart/there is no limit.\\" <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It ... OK, I dare you to get through this song without weeping. A classic ballad, instantly up there with \\"One\\" and \\"Running To Stand Still,\\" but maybe a little better, as it is so nakedly personal. Bono has never sounded better. Best line: \\"And it's you when I look in the mirror/and it's you when I don't pick up the phone ...\\" <br />Love and Peace or Else: Wow, this track sounds just like U2 without sounding anything at all like U2. Might take a couple of spins to grow on you, but it amps up and rocks the walls down. A fantastic rocker that would make Black Rebel Motorcycle Club a tad envious. Best line: \\"Lay down your guns/all your daughters of Zion/All your Abraham sons.\\" This will be fantastic live. <br />City of Blinding Lights: An epic rocker, lit up like a city at night. Will easily stand alongside \\"New Years Day\\" a few years from now. Built for arenas. Best line: \\"They're advertising in the skies/for people like us.\\" <br />All Because of You: One of the best! A heavy, garage-band sound permeates this hard-rocking track that's destined for heavy radio rotation (and deserves it). Ranks up there with \\"Mysterious Ways\\" with its funky guitar riff. Best line: \\"Some people got high rises on their backs.\\" <br />A Man And a Woman: Should solidify Bono as one of the finest soul singers in the world. Another strong radio contender, with a groovy bassline from Mr. Clayton. I love this song. Best line: \\"I been sleeping in the street again/like a stray dog.\\" <br />Crumbs From Your Table: The band deflates mainstream religion on this beautiful track that happens to rock as hard as \\"Vertigo.\\" EXCELLENT guitarwork from The Edge, highly reminiscent of \\"The Joshua Tree.\\" And great vocals from Bono, of course. Best line: \\"With a mouthful of teeth/you ate all your friends.\\" <br />One Step Closer: A slower number, full of empty spaces, but beautifully poetic, full of gorgeous nighttime images of Bono caught somewhere between life and death. Every line in the song is a killer. <br />Original of the Species: Probably the most difficult track on the album; don't give it one fast listen and then dismiss it. Come back later, two or three times, let it grow on you. You'll understand that this song puts U2 firmly in Beatles territory. Best line: \\"Some people got way too much confidence, baby.\\" <br />Yahweh: Here U2 come dangerously close to self-parody with a song that addresses God directly and by name. But they pull it off the right way,by making the song and the chorus so big, so heartfelt, and so genuinely poetic that, by Yahweh, you'll have tears in your eyes while you're singing along. Best line: \\"This love is like a drop in the ocean.\\" <br /> <br />What else can I say? It's the ultimate U2 album, the one they've been working toward for 26 years. Yeah, we had to wait a long time, but the end result is fantastic. Those expecting something different or \\"better\\" would probably have never been satisfied with anything. The refreshing thing about U2 is that they continue to move forward without losing sight of the things that fire them up. These guys are going to go down in history as one of the top five bands ever, if they're not already there.
B0006399FS|5.0|Vertigo-Straight on rock...everyone has heard this one by now! <br />Miracle Drug-Beautifal song that just keeps building <br />Sometime You Can't Make it On Your Own-Brilliant song that Bono wrote for his father on his death bed. <br />Love and Peace or Else-For those of us who like the riskier U2 this is the real stand out on the album....heavy! <br />City of Blinding Lights-Great song that will be a great sing along at the concerts. <br />All Because of You-Another one that you just turn up your stereo and enjoy. <br />A man and A Woman-This has the feel of an All That You Can't Leave Behind leftover but it is very infectuous after several listens and has turned into a favorite. <br />Crumbs From Your Table-Great lyrics and a great song....very solid....rumor has it U2 wrote this one while they were trashed. <br />One Step Closer-This is a great lead in to the final 2 songs....has a very Unforgettable Fire feel to it. <br />Original of The Species-This may be one of the top 10 songs U2 has ever done.  It is brilliant and gives you goosebumps. <br />Yahweh-Great closer and very upbeat for a U2 closer.  Brillian lyrics and it is really a nice song. <br />Fast Cars-For those of us who bought the deluxe version this song should have been on the standard release and in my opinion could have been a single due to the simple fact it is catchy tune and different from any sound I have heard from U2. <br /> <br />I hope this review helps.....but when it's all said and done it is music and some people will like it and some people will not...just buy it and make up your own mind.
B0006399FS|1.0|better than all you can leave behind mainly because of the rocky \\"vertigo\\" but by not that much.
0316666343|5.0|This book is slim but the pages are packed. I agree with the other reveiwers about the ending but don't let it put you off the book. <br /> <br />In my own family I had a brother who died at birth when the obstetrician made some very bad judgement calls. His actions were never reviewed and he was never disciplined. I was slightly older than Buckley, the brother in the book. 33 years later the effect on the family is still felt, still locked down, still not talked about. If this book did nothing else it opened the floodgates of tears time and again, not crying for Susie but for my brother, and for my family. My eyes ache but I feel lighter.  <br /> <br />I hope my heaven turns out to half as good as Susie's!
B00068IOWC|5.0|...this one ranks up there with the very best of U2.  I have loved the band since *Boy*, and my fave albums were the late 80s albums (*Unforgettable Fire*, *Joshua Tree*, and *Rattle and Hum*).   <br /> <br />While there is much to love in the 1990s catalog, and *All You Can't Leave Behind* was also a well-done album (backed by the best tour EVER), this album pulls together all the sounds that have helped define U2 and its transitions over the years.  This is the cleanest, best package I've heard since *Joshua Tree*.  Bono found his best poetry again (maybe the return this year of that case of lyrics lost so long ago was providential), the Edge is TIGHT, and, as always, Adam and Larry provide the bass/percussion foundation that has made this band so consistently good for 25 years.  And they have finally made an art of drawing on other musical influences while still sounding like U2, not imitative.  (If you listen closely, you'll hear touches of everything from the Beatles to P.J. Harvey.)  They came close with *New York* on the last album, but they've done an even better job here. <br /> <br />This is a fine work to usher one of the legendary Rock and Roll Bands into the Hall of Fame next year.  And the best part is they are still making some of their best music - something that doesn't always apply to Hall of Famers.
B0006399FS|5.0|I keep reading about people on these reviews hating on Bono. Bono this, Bono that. Bono meets with politicians, Bono talks too much. U2 sold out for the deal they made with Apple and I-tunes (even though no currency was exchanged).  <br />CAN WE JUST STAY WITH THE IMPORTANT THING: THE MUSIC!!!!  <br />Vertigo rocks, the album is top notch, all of the personal issues outside of the music is bollox.  <br />

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I am writing this for serious Miyazaki fans since watching either Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away. Some of you who have watched this movie may find this critque interesting. <br /> <br />This movie has an excellent animation, moving story and well designed character development. Having said that I am going to give ratings to all his other movies, so that you will know what to expect of his other movies. <br /> <br />1. Nausicaa <br />2. Laputa (castle in the sky) <br />3. Mononoke <br />4. Totoro <br />5. Conan <br />6. Luipin III, cagliostro <br />7. Kiki's delivery <br />8. Porco Rosso <br />9. Spirited Away <br />10. Holmes <br />11. Heisei Tanuki Ponpoko <br />12. Cat Returns <br /> <br />As a side, I'd like to state that this movie is what Miyazaki devoted his whole life into. The movie itself is actually a shorter version of his comic book that has taken many years to complete (mostly because he took a long break right after 6th book). So if you really want to understand his works, you need to get those comic books. (I think there are 7 of them). It has been said that Princess Mononoke is a reenactment of Nausicaa in a comic book. The story is very complex and very intriguing.
B000002LFZ|3.0|It really does come to a surprise about so many acts that really seem to sell well when they are young, but it is just sad that we often forget about classic artists that have influenced us as a whole part of life. That happens with so many artists as they get older. Yet, out of all of them, very few of them really have survived all that way, that Fleetwood Mac has still stood. They truthfully have made a fantastic impact, and they legendary group continues to influence the best that there still is to come. They really also have made a good impact with hits collections that also showcase the scenes of the Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks and company.<br /><br />The 1988 Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits is a collection of 16 of their big songs from the 70's and 80's. The catalog on this collection is just very strong, and still maintains very well here with a lot of great classics like Don't Stop, Tusk, and 80's classics like Little Lies, Gypsy, and Mirage's Hold Me. The songs here really bring out the best of their high points in the industry. The unfotunate downside is that a lot of the songs here weren't remastered as well as their 2002 Very Best Of collection which brings out so many more wonderful reflections to the longtime legacy, or reflections before Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham joing Fleetwood Mac from the late 60's and early 70's.<br /><br />All in all, Fleetwood Mac's 1988 Greatest Hits does handle itself quite well, but their just could've been a little more that should've been added on here. Some might be torn between the this collection and the better 2002 collection. Still, for some the Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits is a very nice collection that shouldn't stop thinking about tomorrow.<br /><br />Music: B<br /><br />Packaging: C<br /><br />Remastering: C-<br /><br />Overall: C
B00005JLEU|2.0|I have been Miyazaki's fan since when Nausicaa came out in 1986. I have enjoyed many of his works but I must say that Spirited Away is ranked low among \\"Cat returns\\" and \\"Heisei Tanuki Ponpoko\\".  <br /> <br />It has almost become a \\"politically correct\\" thing to praise whenever Miyazaki releases his movies. When Princess Mononoke came out in Japan, he has vaguely announced that that was going to be his last big movie with Studio Gibli. There are many long stance fans for Miyazaki who went to watch the movie in theatre to witness his masterpiece. \\"Princess Mononoke\\" although is ranked third in his works, deserved all the praises that it went to. I however feel that this work does not deserve full praises that has been echoed internationally. <br /> <br />The story is not spectacular. It is good but it is just okay. The character setting is rather poor and storyline is rather brand compared to his standards. Some may consider this movie culturally significant but if you dig into Japanese animation you will soon recognize that this is not the case. Story told in the movie is original as far as script goes but not original as it follows some of the classical folktales in Japan.  <br /> <br />If this movie came out under other's author's name, I gurantee this movie would not have been famous. I would have given 3 stars as if this had been the case but gives 2 as warning to those who expects true Japanese animation masterpiece.
B000002H6C|3.0|Members of Metallica said that Cliff Burton would have kicked their butts if they hadn't continued after Burton's untimely death. Well, I think he would have kicked their butts anyway if he had known that they would let their new bassist play on this album without having his amp plugged in. It's all drums, guitars, and vocals, and it sounds odd and a bit thin. <br /> <br />Apart from the sound, the songs are overall quite good and some songs are great, like the amazing \\"One\\" or good speedy \\"Blackened\\". However, many songs suffer from being unnecessarily long with parts where nothing happenes (probably meant to slowly build up the song, but how slowly can you do that?). <br /> <br />If you can get hold on some of these songs on live albums, they probably sound better since some of the redundant musical material (e.g. 2 minutes intro on \\"Justice\\") may be skipped, and the bass is definitely plugged in!
B0006284JQ|5.0|For the last time. And when I say she is wonderful, I really don't mean it, but she puts together great albums and the sound is incredible. For 5 years Britney has topped all the charts possibly imaginable. She has a great and unique voice which seperates her from other artists like her and better of yet, has compiled almost all her greatest hits(excluded is Don't Let Me be the Last to Know, From the Bottom of My Broken Heart and I Love Rock'n Roll(single in the UK, I believe, which is why it was left out). Though I think, it would suck to see her live except for the sexy dancing she does, oh, and to see her, she is probably the last artist I would tell someone to see live. But thankfully, this is not live and all these songs are a great showcase of what we remember her by, starting with: <br /> <br />My Perogative: 5/5 Who doesn't love this song? It is her best single by far. So upbeat, so great and hot!! <br />Toxic: 4.5/5 Her 2nd single off of In the Zone, which included her best video in the 5 years she was here. Who knows if she will come back, or if this is really the end... anyone remember Celine Dione's retirement? Man, what a retirement, oh wait, she is back again... darn. This song is so cool though. <br />I'm A Slave 4 U: 4.5/5 So sexy, I love it. <br />Oops!... I did it Again: 4/5 Anyone remember the old Britney? Up until yesterday, I hadn't heard this song in years. Well, two months ago I caught the end of the video, but that's it. <br />Me Against the Music: 4.5/5 A great 1st single from In The Zone, featuring Madonna, but I think she is past her prime and kind of destroyed the song. Please Madonna, if you stick around, do something good. But Britney can hold a song way better and that's why this is a good song. <br />Stronger: 5/5 Accompanied by a hot video and the song is by far her coolest. Amazing single!! <br />Everytime: 5/5 This song is so sad, and so incredibly beautiful. I love it!! <br />...Baby One More Time: 4/5 Oh my god, her first singleever. Now I know it has been ages since I heard this one. It brings back memories, well, not really, but it's a great song. <br />(You Drive Me) Crazy: 5/5 Her best song from Baby One More Time. It is so upbeat and cool <br />Boys(The CO-ED) Remix feat. Pharrel Williams: 4.5/5 I like Pharrell's voice on this, it makes it different then the original song off Britney. It's a cool song. <br />Sometimes: 3.5/5 This is probably my least favourite single that was included on this cd, don't know why, it just never really got to me as Everytime did. It's not even close to as beautiful as that song. <br />Overprotected(The Darkchild Remix)- 4/5 Cool, upbeat and fun, but not as good as the original version off Britney <br />Lucky- 5/5 Now this is a beautiful song. I like it so much, hurray Britney. <br />Outrageous- 5/5 My kind of music, well not really, but it is super cool <br />I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman- 5/5 Pretty, heard it way too much, but pretty. <br />I've Just Begun(Having My Fun)- 5/5 Unreleased and it is so fun. You have to hear this. <br />Do Somethin'- 2/5 Bla, do something about this track, no wonder it wasn't released before, still fussin over it being released now. <br /> <br />Bonus Disc: <br />Toxic(Armand Van Helden Remix Edit)- 4/5 Not bad, I like the original better though. It's cool <br />Everytime(Hi-Bias Radio Remix)- 5/5 Completely the best of the remixes, even better then the actual song. It rocks!! <br />Breathe on Me(Jacques Lu Cont Mix)- 5/5 8 min. of the hottest song that ever existed. I could play this over and over and even over again, it is so incredibly hot!! <br />Outrageous(Junkie XL's Dancehall Mix)- 5/5 Fantastic remix, she has good remixes of her songs. <br />Chris Cox Megamix- 5/5 Amazing finishing touches to a great remix cd, including remixes of the hits-Baby One More Time, (You Drive Me) Crazy, I'm A Slave 4 U, Oops!... I did it Again, Stronger, Everytime, Overprotected and of course finishing with Toxic. Overall, it's about 5min. in length, a little less. <br /> <br /> A great purchase for any Britney fan. I imagine this cd will top the chart for weeks, despite its massive competition at this time, I think Britney is the ultimate superstar. This is an amazing album, though personally, I don't really like her, her music is great and she is very sexy, so hands down to that and this is something worth applauding for. Definitely BUY THIS!
B0006399FS|5.0|Who hadn't heard Vertigo before Atomic Bomb album came out?  U2, in brilliant marketing, decided to be very active before this album came out, putting Vertigo all over the baseball playoffs, introducing a great U2 iPod, and featuring articles in newspapers and magazines.  And they are allowed to, thanks to the album they have put out.  <br /> <br />Much like \\"Pride\\" was the hit single off The Unforgettable Fire yet felt out of place with the sound of that album, so too does Vertigo belie the rest of Atomic Bomb.  There are no songs that rock like Vertigo does, not even Love and Peace or Else, which sounds like a mix between Achtung and \\"Bullet the Blue Sky.\\"  No, the rest of the album is indeed a little slower, but not quieter.  ATYCLB was a tremendous album for me, but if anything was wrong with it, it was fairly weak musically for these guys, with the exception of Beautiful Day.  But on Atomic Bomb, even if you think the songs are too soft, they're active, and the instruments sound great.   <br /> <br />As has been said, this is indeed an Edge album.  He takes over many of the songs.  His sound is at once something I've never heard from him yet hearkens back to Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree time.   <br /> <br />His best songs are Bono's best as well.  Vertigo (which does have significant lyrics, if you listen for meaning behind the great music), Miracle Drug, and City of Blinding Lights are the songs that will be classics.  Original of the Species and One Step Closer to Knowing are both very good, and we knew all about Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own before it came out, and the lyrics are truly open, vulnerable, more emotional than anything else on the album, which is a personal one.  The best part of this song is the bridge, by far. <br /> <br />The guitar coming from Edge on Miracle Drug and City of Blinding Lights, in particular, is tremendous, epic, anthemic, intimate, emotional, just like the lyrics.  More than anything, the words to this album fit the music. <br /> <br />And Bono's lyrics are great, as always.  \\"Would you deny for others what you demand for yourself?\\" ...On Vertigo, he portrays himself trying to find good in a world of terror and anguish.  In Miracle Drug, a person (from someone he knew) trying to get the thoughts out of his head despite a brain disorder - \\"There is no failure here, sweetheart / Just when you quit.\\" ...In City of Blinding Lights, is it a loss of innocence?  A love song to New York?  A great landscape song?  Bono is famous for his ambiguous lyrics, which is perhaps why so many people relate to them.   <br /> <br />But we have had only a day to listen to this album.  U2's albums often require time to fully appreciate them--Unforgettable, Achtung, and ATYCLB are examples.  (Boy, War and Joshua are great from the start.)  In a way, all we're listening for now is the sound, the instruments, and they sound great.  After a few listenings one can begin to dissect the lyrics, but the sound is what hits you first.  But U2 has accomplished what has always been a trademark - each album has a similar sound throughout, yet one that is different from each other album's.   <br /> <br />U2 are one of rock's last remaining greats, and they've eclipsed most of the ones before them.  Instead of talking about sex and drugs, they manage to put emotion, hope, faith, death, mortality, and feeling into rock.  For this we should be grateful.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I was tired of seeing reviews by individuals with closed minds. Many of the top Metal sites and magazines have called this \\"Nightwish's best album to date...\\" and I agree. I would rate this as the best power metal album for 2004, and all years prior. The combination of symphony and metal has not been done this well by any band before, despite the other reviews you may read. I'm not going to say that I love every song on the CD. But I love most every song on the CD. Buy it!! You will not be sorry.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|Epic/Progressive/Folk-Inspired/Neo-Classical Death Metal with the perfect, extremely unique blend of heavy guitars, traditional middle-eastern instruments, clean singing, calm instrumentals, death growls, female vocals, choirs and chants, and a tinge of technicality - there is even some singing in Hebrew. I'd agree with anyone who says you simply can't put a label on something like this, it is just music. Ethnic Metal? That seems fitting. Additional instruments include piano, keyboard, cello and violin. This album probably reminds me mostly of Symphony X's \\"V,\\" because of that album's Egyptian themes, except this has death growls and is less cheesy. This album really doesn't contain much death growls at all, which is perfect - I really wouldn't be surprised if they totally abandon them on their next album or maybe two albums from now (I'm actually expecting it) and it would be a logical and natural progression. Of course, they certainly don't ruin this album or anything. I've never heard any of their other albums and unfortunately they seem a little hard to find.<br /><br />The album flows beautifully from one song to the next, with very good transitions from soft to heavy parts that some bands don't accomplish very well. The best part is when there is heavy guitar riffing and the folk instruments (I wish I actually knew what they were called) atop it with either vocal type, they really don't keep alternating between this in the songs too much, and when they do, it is very smooth The CD clocks in at 68 minutes, and I really don't understand when people complain that that kind of length is too much. It is only too long if it starts getting repetitive, which this album definitely doesn't do. I mean, there are 20-minute recordings that can be \\"too long\\" because they ran out of ideas. With Orphaned Land, the ideas and great musicianship never dry up and it's certainly not pretentious or over-the-top.<br /><br />When some people find out Religion is the lyrical theme they get totally repelled and automatically hate the band. That really shouldn't be the case, it is more of a story that involves religion and is put together nicely, not preaching to the listener, and even if they were preaching, the music is so good I wouldn't care. Lyrics never mattered to me that much as long as they aren't ridiculously silly, and if they happen to be good, it's an extra bonus. Some of this is sung in Hebrew which I already mentioned, which definitely adds to the theme and provides an interesting touch.<br /><br />The album starts out with \\"Birth of the Three,\\" with a nice powerful riff, quickly adding death growls and traditional folk instruments. It turns out to have a good combination of all the vocals, occasional piano, and nice rhythm changes, and at the end there is an angelic choir singing with melodic heavy riffing in the back... probably the first time I've heard that in any music. \\"Ocean Land\\" is one of the best songs, it starts out with fast-paced strumming, I think it's a sitar, and then suddenly goes into the main song, contains excellent clean vocals in the \\"chorus,\\" a little more choir vocals, and a perfect blend of heaviness with death vocals and a pretty nice solo. \\"The Kiss of Babylon\\" starts out with some of the heaviest material on here, and suddenly adds some more female choir vocals - so outrageous but it sounds perfect. Near the middle of this song, they abandon lyrics and just sing \\"Na na na na na na na\\" instead. It's not horrible, but they do it for a little too long for my tastes. Then there is a lone female vocalist singing in Hebrew, who has a gorgeous voice, but this also goes on for just a tad too long. Then begins the next song, \\"A'salk\\" which just has the folk instruments and also ethnic tribal hand-drums with the same vocals; it's a short song that brings a nice refreshing direction to the album and foreshadows a series of a few songs like this.<br /><br />\\"Halo Dies\\" is heavy again, using a traditional instrument that sounds a little different at the beginning, then containing some of the most aggressive vocals for a while, before breaking down into a little keyboard and acoustic section then containing some of the best metal riffs in the CD. \\"A Call to Awake\\" isn't too much different from the heavier tracks, but then \\"Building the Ark\\" suddenly begins with some ethnic hand-drums, acoustic instruments, and male + female chanting type vocals and continues this way, it's a beautiful, encompassing track with great atmosphere. The next song \\"Norra el Norra\\" has some excellent male singing in Hebrew, and is one of the calmer tracks with distorted guitar, containing a great mixture of heavy and soft. Near the end a brilliant mini-piano concerto is added to the upbeat strumming in the background. \\"The Calm Before the Flood\\" is the album's calm breath of air with slow acoustic playing and strings, very lonely and eerily troubling. The band is knows how to make tracks like this just as well as heavy tracks, it truly sounds like the calm before the flood. At the end, the sound of rain quickly arrives, transitioning into the title track which adds some thunder and truly apprehensive sounding fast-paced strings, slowly adding the guitars, turning out to be another quality metal track. This turns right into \\"The Storm Still Rages Inside,\\" the longest song. A good chunk of it is a metal instrumental with a long, winding solo, finally ending with a few female choir vocals and the sounds of water. But there is still more, after the flood is a \\"Rainbow\\", a calm, simple acoustic track with the sounds of birds chirping. It might seem like this drags on too long from my explanation, but I don't think it does, it seems like a good length.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the most unique, diverse and excellent metal albums I've ever heard, and will be in anyone's collection; it's one of my very top purchases of 2004. I really have no other bands to compare it to besides that Symphony X album which is kind of a stretch, so if you like your metal unique and thought-provoking, this is for you.rument that sounds a little different at the beginning, then containing some of the most aggressive vocals for a while, before breaking down into a little keyboard and acoustic section then containing some of the best metal riffs in the CD. \\"A Call to Awake\\" isn't too much different from the heavier tracks, but then \\"Building the Ark\\" suddenly begins with some ethnic hand-drums, acoustic instruments, and male + female chanting type vocals and continues this way, it's a beautiful, encompassing track with great atmosphere.

1573229725|3.0|Fingersmith follows two orphan girls in Victorian England through the twists and turns of a complex fight to possess inheritance money. The novel is an entertaining trip through the seamy underside of 19th century English life, but how is became a Booker nominee is beyond me --- it must have been a thin year for Commonwealth literature.  The novel is completely plot-driven, with characters who achieve two dimensions but do not approach three. The definition of great literature is a matter of opinion.  Mine is that it should say something about the world as it truly is, about what it means to be human.  Fingersmith is a fun read but not illuminating and ultimately shallow.
B000000OA6|5.0|Queen must've known that Innuendo was likely to be their final album (Made In Heaven doesn't count), and as a result they gave it their all. There are many songs that harken back to the theatrical period of the band's career, but the material comes off as relevant instead of nostalgic. Not only was Freddie on fire, the entire band was in top form as well. Even some of the weaker tracks (like \\"Delilah\\" and \\"Bijou\\") have something worth listening to...the atmospheric elements will tantalize your ears. Queen was primed for a comeback in the US with Innuendo, but...well, we all know what (sadly & unfortunately) happened. A winner of an album, and their best since the \\"glory days\\". Get it NOW...
B000268QB2|5.0|I don't care if there are no guitars; in fact I wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't posted about half a million times in reviews on this site.  Ben Folds Five never needed guitar and they cranked out quite a few good tunes.  This album is a cross between something like BF5 and Starsailor, but I only use that as a reference for those unfamiliar with Keane, as I was.  These guys are great, the album is full of excellent tunes and in fact there aren't any I don't like.  Hopes and Fears has some rocking tunes, some mellow tunes, and some uplifting tunes.  I haven't stopped listening to this album since I got it and it would be safe to say it's on my top 10 list for this year.  The frontman's voice is dramatic and full of range, while the piano is a great fit with his sound.  Go for this album and you won't be disappointed.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I enjoyed the movie after I got over the initial shock of it being so much different from the first two movies.  The first time I watched it was dissapointed because I expected it to be like the first two movies.  The second time I watched it I enjoyed it more.   The major events in the movie follow what happens in the book but some minor things are changed.  The whole fight between Ron and Hermione is gone....Harry gets his Firebolt at the end of the movie not at Christmas....the scene at the Whomping Willow is slightly different.....little stuff like that is changed or missing.  The actors that played Peter, Sirius and Remus are not like the people I have envisioned in my mind but they do a great job as far as acting.  Daniel, Emma and Rupert do an excellent job and their acting continues to improve with each movie.   <br /> <br />Once the die hard Harry Potter fan gets over the intial shock then I am sure they will find it to be an enjoyable movie.  I know I certainly did.
B0006399FS|3.0|If we all made the mistake of falling for the hype and anticipated U2's new CD to be on par with 'The Joshua Tree' and 'Achtung Baby', thats our mistake. They never claimed they were out to best those efforts. Perhaps thats why all this negative reaction from even diehard fans.<br /><br />However, as a plain and simple rock album, 'Atomic Bomb' serves the purpose. It is not a masterpiece in the least sense, but by no means is it a terrible album. The only real problem I have is with the length, but I guess the norm is to have about 10-12 songs on CDs these days, clocking in at around 35-45 minutes. The thing that bothers me is that U2 sold out with all those TV spots and advertisements that seemed to cry out corporate whoredom. I don't like to think of them that way, what with Bonos' environmental and social stances, but what else could one think following the blitz of hype we've been witness to?<br /><br />Artistically dissected, 'Atomic Bomb' has its' moments. The much-played 'Vertigo' actually sounds much better when you listen to it without the visuals from the video. Its probably the best 'rock' track on the album. The rest, as many have said here, seem quite filler, but if you let this sit in your player for a couple of days, you'll find that they are of the same top-notch quality as any other U2 album. Its amazing how many poor reviews this CD is getting, because I actually quite like it. Just don't expect too much, and you will be pleasantly suprised.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 have always been a band I liked, but they've been around so long I couldn't say I really loved them.  There are rumors this might be their last, so I picked this up when it first came out.  I have to say it's quite good, probably better than their last album.  Here is my breakup: <br /> <br />VERTIGO = good first single, not as good as Beautiful day, though.  Grade: B. <br />MIRACLE DRUG = great song with great guitar playing by the Edge, very addictive chorus.  Grade: B+ <br />SOMETIMES = best song here, so emotional and so catchy, could be a big hit.  Grade: A+ <br />LOVE & PEACE = dont really like it, experimental but it goes nowhere. Grade: C- <br />CITY OF BLINDING LIGHTS = another gem, very long and epic sounding like it's from \\"the unforgettable fire\\" album.  Grade: A- <br />ALL BECAUSE OF YOU = old school rock n'roll, another possible single.  Grade: B+ <br />A MAN AND A WOMAN = fantastic, u2's attempt at soul and r&b.  It works. Grade: A- <br />CRUMBS FROM TABLE = good track, still hasn't grown into me.  See me in a few weeks. <br />ONE STEP CLOSER = one of the weaker tracks, sounds like something off the \\"passengers\\" experiments. Grade: D+ <br />ORIGINAL OF THE SPECIES = fabulous, this could be a real big hit.  Sounds like the Beatles.  Grade: A <br />YAHWEH = a good song and a perfect closer.  Grade: B- <br /> <br />I think this is the perfect follow up to ATYCLB.  A very good album which will sound better on the road.  What will they do next?
B00005JLEX|5.0|<br />OK, everyone take note...this is the way to release a TV series box set: <br />A) Load it up with extras...commentary, deleted scenes (albeit light), gag reel, docs, etc <br />B) Don't try to fake us out with partial seasons disguised as full seasons (I'm talking to you Happy Days, Threes Company, et al) Seinfeld did the right thing and combined seasons 1 and 2 in one set since they were both partial <br />C) Don't rip us off on the price...i'm talking to you Star Trek, SCTV, etc... <br />This is an excellent box set that is recommended for anyone who likes comedy, only problems: the commentary can be a little sparse (long stretches when noone says anything) and the fact that the show is so overexposed (playing on tv every five minutes...not that there's anything wrong with that)
B0002XDODU|5.0|Once again Rammstein pumps out another great addition to the industrial/hard rock genre. \\"Reise,Reise\\" is Rammstein's fourth album and it is by far my favourite. This album is very different in a musical sense from the other albums, because it has a heavier feel and almost all the songs are sung. Where as in previous albums the lyrics sounded some what like rap. If I had to pick a favourite song from \\"Reise,Reise\\" is would definately be Moskau(Moscow) I love the addition vocals by Viktoria Fersh and Till's juxtaposition on Moscow. Aside from the little things Rammsteins' new album \\"Reise,Reise\\" is in my opinion the best cd in my collection.
B00005JLEX|5.0|This classic sit-com follows the adventures of comedian Jerry Seinfeld and his three fictional friends--the insecure, easily irritated George Costanza (Jason Alexander), the aggressive,  neurotic Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and the supremely strange Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards)--as  they deal with the absurdities of everyday life.  In the opinions of many (mine included) it's pretty much the funniest sit-com ever.  Over the course of nine years, it developed a huge cast of memorable supporting characters and some truly hilarious story arcs.  My wife and I love this show.  We wear out tapes that we've made from the TV broadcasts.<br /><br />Now, it's finally being released on DVD.  We received ours in the mail yesterday and I could scarcely be more pleased.  There are tons of extras that will take us hours to get through.  It's nice to see that the creators of the show have gone to great pains to produce a fully loaded set that rewards the fans for their patience.  Let's face it-they would have had a best-seller on their hands even if there were no extras at all.  Let's hope they don't slack off with future releases./
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 has given us a gift with this album.  They have again produced a record that speaks volumes about  their life's journey,  and offers a glimpse to where they would like to take us in the future. I for one hope to tag along.
B0002VYOXQ|4.0|I'm sure there are many reviews about this movie under the regular release.  I'll comment a bit specifically about the superbit version that costs more for higher quality video and audio (without the extras on the disk).  To really get any advantage here you need to have a digital TV (preferably HD but ED will probably work too), a DVD player that puts out a progressive signal (vs. interlaced), and a component or digital connection between your DVD player and TV.  IMO if you don't have all three of these you won't get the benefit of Superbit and should save your money. <br /> <br />This was my first Superbit disk, so I had high expectations.  I'd say there's good news and bad news here.  The good news is that I do think the picture is visibly better.  There is definitely more detail and you can seem more subtle features (texture, reflections, etc.) in the picture.  This also helps some of the dark scenes (many in this movie) with more visible detail.  The bad news is that there's so much more detail that you can see the grain of the film.  I know that's normal for a movie shot on film and it doesn't really bother me (unless I'm looking for it).  However, I do think it detracts slightly from the perceived quality of the picture.  Compare this, for example, to a movie shot in digital and you'll see what I mean.  I'm sure there's some debate over what defines good picture quality so YMMV here.  Finally, the sound is excellent on this DVD, but I can't say that it's significantly better than on the original release over a Dolby Digital system. <br /> <br />So, in the end I'd say that Superbit is great if you really love a movie and want the best PQ you can get for it.  I think that Superbit is probably better for older movies that they can clean up for DVD transfer than for newer movies with a decent original DVD transfer. <br /> <br />Remember that if you want all the extras you won't get them on Superbit.  My one complaint about this specific DVD is that they used thetheatrical release rather than the (now available) director's cut. <br /> <br />Hope this is helpful!
B0006AZMFM|5.0|I absolutely love this album and it is just as good as Innocent Eyes (that was hard to beat!) if not better. It has more emotion and feeling within it which obviously reflects Delta's own life. All the songs are very good, however my personal favourites which Im currently addicted to listening to is The Analyst and Sanctuary! I love them. An excellent album all round and I would definitely recommend anyone to buy it!
B00063EMJG|4.0|It is not worth springing for the CD+DVD version.  The CD is already a HDCD and playing the DVD side to side (A-B testing) to the CD in a HDCD-able player, shows that: <br /> <br />A) The so-called master mixes are the same for both.  <br /> <br />B) The HDCD beats the DVD easily in fidelity and bass response (I know it should'nt be like this).  I used a Denon HDCD compatible player and a SONY SE DVD/SACD player (their top of the line), so both were played in good players. <br /> <br />C) The 2 videos are pretty easy to ignore (buyer beware: the TV ad makes it look that the \\"Rocking in the Free World\\" video is the live Crazy Horse version from \\"Weld\\". It isn't.  It is a lip-synch video to the \\"Freedom\\" version). <br /> <br />Mind you, the DVD version IS NOT a DVD-Audio version, just a  Dolby Digital version (there is a difference), but it should have sounded better than the HDCD (properly decoded). <br /> <br />As for the song selection, ho-hum.  Maybe the DVD could have had alternate or live versions to make it worthwhile.
B0006399FS|3.0|The CD will require more listenings, but aside from \\"Vertigo\\", \\"All Because of You\\", and a few other brief moments, the music seems rather bland.  Too sappy and boring. I know, based on the media gushing and fan worship permeating the ether, I'm in the minority with this view, but the hoopla, in my opinion, is hollow.  I think people are so relieved to hear ANYTHING other than the packaged sludge on the airwaves, that the relief provided by 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is encompassing enough that listeners don't even bother to turn a critical eye on their new musical messiah. The current crop of fans welcome the \\"new sound\\" of these last 2 CDs, but I haven't been impressed with the group since 'Zooropa', which many others apparently despise.  I've listened to CDs that merely take time to \\"grow\\" on me, but 'All That You Leave Behind' never did.  Soaring emotional vocals and Edge's trademark strumming don't do it for me.  This band is an exception where, I believe, style IS actually more important than substance. A band's overall \\"sound\\" can sometimes be more relevant than its content. Their foray into techno and electronica was far more interesting and exciting. Edge's \\"Numb\\" was a startlingly stylistic and sonic breakthrough. But, heartfelt confessionals and universal metaphors resonating through what is currently becoming an overwrought sound do not bring triumph to this latest CD.  Perhaps the group has set too high of a standard by previously producing some of the best music on the planet.  But, they need, once more, a drastic reinvention to keep them unique and exciting.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Every once in a while, you come across a movie where everything, I mean EVERYTHING works. The story. The casting. The acting. The music. The direction. You become so engrossed in the movie that you lose track of time. You forget everything that was on your mind before the movie started. You go to bed that night thinking about how good that movie was. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is one of those rare movies.<br /><br />Now, I have come across people who initially resist watching this movie because they don't want to watch a \\"prison\\" movie. This movie is so much more than that. It is a story of hope; the survival of hope despite all attempts to crush it. When all one has is hope. When hope is all that drives you. When hope is all you have left.<br /><br />Two things always stand out to me the most in this movie. The first is having the always outstanding Morgan Freeman eloquently narrate the story along the way. It is a stroke of pure genius, and it adds so much to the movie. The second thing is the musical score. I am a big fan of movie scores, and how much they enhance the story. It is amazing how much the music of a particular film can impact upon the total movie experience. Well, this is PERFECTION.<br /><br />This is simply one of the best movies ever made, a movie you can watch time and time again. I give it my highest recommendation possible.
B000065PUE|5.0|One of the most talented and amazing bands! The first time I heard the Pixies I fell in love. This album is probably thier most mainstream, but it is no doubt a must have. SOme of my favorite songs are \\"Hey,\\" \\"Tame,\\" and \\"NO.13 Baby.\\" If you like this CD I def. suggest buying Surfer Rosa, Come on Pilgrim, and Trompe le Monde.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|My wife rented this one night and brought it home for us to watch. My initial reaction was lukewarm, but I was in the mood for something a little different. Well, I was totally blown away by how much I loved this movie! And I'm a guy! I really liked this movie, from start to finish. And what a finish! All of these different characters and storylines, and they all wrap up so nicely in the end! I ended up really caring about all of the different plotlines, and they are about 10 of them! Well, only one I could have done without, but that still leaves 9! And, for me to care that much about 9 different storylines in a movie says something. This movie put me in such a good mood afterwards, I recommend it to anybody who has lost their faith in the power of love. I now have the DVD and I have watched it 3 more times already! What a heartwarming, \\"feel-good\\" movie! And the different emotional payoffs that occur as the movie starts to wind up are really done well. I have to give this movie a 5 star rating, it's just that good!
0761129235|5.0|I am not a fan of self-help books, but this parcel of wisdom is an exception. Dr. Maurer gently guides you through a whole new way of perceiving your life, and towards the path to making those improvements you've been putting off indefinitely.  The key? Baby steps. Sounds so simple, and it is. But you'll want to read  Dr. Maurer's explanation for WHY this works, and HOW you can make it work for you. Forget about doing 20 pushups -- get down on the floor and do ONE. Floss ONE tooth. I'm oversimplifying, but that's the point -- Dr. Maurer encourages you to take monumental tasks and break them down into small manageable digestable morsels. Big problems? He teaches you how to ask small questions that will get them solved. I can't do justice to the genius of his presentation. This is well organized material, based on a series of lectures he has delivered around the globe to big companies and small organizations -- as well as his experiences as a psychotherapist in private practice. It gets proven results. The writing is engaging, the quotes and anecdotes are entertaining, and instead of the usual vague advice one typically gleans from this genre, you'll learn from an abundance of scientific and historical evidence (entertainingly presented), as well as receive hardcore action steps that YOU  can undertake today. You'll be looking at life through a whole new set of lenses -- and with less stress and more productivity. Most powerfully, it demonstrates how each one of us can dramatically affect not only our own lives, but also exert positive influence over those around us.  Buy a copy for yourself, and another batch as gifts for your friends, family, and colleagues. It's that good!  Enjoy!
B000667GFK|5.0|A collection of beautiful Mexican songs, with exception of the song Motivos, which are of Venezuela (author:  Italo Pizzolante) also very pretty.
B0000013G9|5.0|I cannot believe that 10 years has passed since TLC unleased this album on the world. Bill Clinton was prez, O.J. ran away from the cops, Seinfeld was #1, and America was in love with Ini Kamoze's the \\"Hotstepper\\". Way back in the winter of 1995, \\"Creep\\" found its way to the #1 spot on the charts. \\"Red Light Special\\" and \\"Diggin' On You\\" made it in the spring. And then that funky summer there was \\"Waterfalls\\". You could enjoy this CD even if you were into alternative grundge rock, it was that good. The tunes were smooth and had a slick groove to them. Left Eye we love and miss you. Definetly invest sometime into hearing this poignant music.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with the music of Dream Theater knows the unmistakable virtuosity and improvisational genius and dexterity that DT's members offer everytime they hit the stage on their electrifying 3+ hour performances. This is certainly not an exception, and the production is at the top.  The sound is great, visual quality is better than ever and each band member gets their best angle. Recorded on April 26, 2004, Live at Budokan is Dream Theater's best concert video effort since the beginning of their career. The set-list showcases both powerful and amazing songs from every DT album, and the \\"Instrumedly\\" is simply an awe-inspiring piece that will certainly blow you away. This DVD also includes footage from the band's Japanese tour. You won't regret buying this musical jewel.  LaBrie's voice sounds great, John Myung is definitely a powerhouse of a bass player, Petrucci is incredible, Rudess is officially not human (that man is a keyboard-playing-machine!), and Portnoy - as usual, simply amazing. Buy this! You won't be disappointed.
B000669GAI|5.0|First off, I hope that \\"Ten\\" will get the Legacy Edition the same as Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" did. 1 remastered CD. 1 CD of rarities. 1 DVD of the promo videos. It definitely deserves it.  <br /> <br />\\"Lost Dogs\\" and the acoustic live CD they recently put out are also \\"must-owns\\".  <br /> <br />As far as this CD goes, I truly love it. It's a trip down memory lane in a big way. Even though it's not entirely chronological, it does start off with \\"Ten\\" and works its way to \\"Man of the Hour\\" from the \\"Big Fish\\" soundtrack, but does deviate along the way.  <br /> <br />\\"Last Kiss\\" and \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" are the only ones that came over from \\"Lost Dogs\\". For me, the songs I missed on this were \\"Release\\", \\"Crazy Mary\\", \\"The Long Road\\" and \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\". I also think that they should've recorded \\"Crown Of Thorns\\" for it.  <br /> <br />I think this will be especially great for people who gave up on Pearl Jam sometime in the mid 90s. I have no doubt whatsoever that this will renew their interest in Pearl Jam again. Warning: you'll have a hard time taking this one out of your CD player because you'll start listening to it more than once.  <br /> <br />The only complaints I have are that the packaging could have been better, and like John Mellencamp's \\"Words and Music\\" (which only has 5 videos even though John's done almost 40), should have included their promo videos because there are few of them,although there is no shortage of live footage from over the years.  <br /> <br />Even though this CD signals the end of their time with Epic, it doesn't sound like they're \\"cashing in\\". The song selection does sound handpicked by the band and the amount of songs they put on there is pretty hefty, none of which are filler, and even put a song that they didn't have to put on there (Man of the Hour) that was recorded after their contract was up, but did.  <br /> <br />A band to be experienced live. Enjoy this in the meantime.

B00068IOWC|5.0|It seems there's no middleground with the latest U2 missive: you either love it or hate it - or at least think you do. I've been a diehard fan since hearing War in high school, and after loving them so long, each new release is an adventure. I curled up with my wife to listen to this one the day it was released and I was in shock - it felt like I got hit by a bomb. The emotions felt all wrong. I had this same experience with Pop, AYCLB and now this. I was kinda prepared, but also disappointed because my heart was set on Achtung and Joshua... I needed some soul searching. I'm a SCREENWRITER by trade and emotions are where I make my living. U2 is the greatest band ever - and even greater live because they totally grasp the power and glory of the emotional arc. You leave their presence transformed, which is why we come back again and again. If stories are metaphors for living, concerts can be religious revivals. Enter jaded, broken, bleeding, your faith faltering... leave restored, revived, ready to battle your and the world's demons. I think Eno was so instrumental to U2 for shaping the arc of their albums. People love Joshua and Achtung because they're a story in a box - not a misplaced melody along the whole journey from first song to last. NOW here's my theory: POP, AYCLB and now Bomb contain equally great songs, as we know from the concerts. The problem is that they're sequenced wrong emotionally. U2 figures it out in concert (Walk On is a closer - it should have been on the album...). I'm just a joe-schmo who makes his living and loving by emotions, but for the sake of my own edification I've spent the last 3 days putting this latest batch of songs through the same story models I use for writing, and voila - the album arcs. Of course it arcs. It's U2. Only the transitions are missing, the little sonic bridges linking one song to the next. While I realize nobody really gives a rip what I think, I've decided to at least share what I've found and let you decide. This concert tour will be another for the ages... <br /> <br />Here goes: <br /> <br />1 - Vertigo.  The grabber, of course, it sets the whole emotional tone for what's to come. This is about feeling, worhipping (kneeling), trusting your heart to dismantle the disastrous course we're headed down. Turn it up. Let it hit you where you live. <br /> <br />2 - Love and Peace or Else.   The thesis/question - Where is love? The rest of the album will probe the limits of where the solution might be. Sonically it spins from Vertigo and reminds me a little of Even Better Than The Real Thing. It just fits here. <br /> <br />3 - A Man and a Woman.   Where is the love? Between man and woman. Not easy - you are tempted to trade love for romance... but it's there if you work at it. <br /> <br />4 - Fast Cars.   The irony is that it probably didn't make the official album because of \\"fit\\". Well, it fits here. Segues acoustically from the end of man/woman. The guitars blend and we're in. I just LOVE this lyrically, Bono's little CNBC riff but as well for the guitars. <br /> <br />5 - Original of the Species.  Seems at first like it belongs later, but that's one of the problems with the original sequencing. Too many songs vying for the same late-inning turf. It's a beautiful song with the baby melody that reminds me of Babyface. Plus, here you get the line \\"baby slow down\\" transitioning off Fast Cars. Fast cars - baby slow down... <br /> <br />6 - Crumbs From Your Table.   People complain that Bono's politics interfere with U2's songs. Rubbish. His compassion and caring are a large part of why the band remains relevant. The songs just have to fit the emotive context of the album. Otherwise they feel clunky. Again, think concert. Wouldn't that ending line from Edge sound great next to Gone???  <br /> <br />7 - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. In screenwriting, we're at the midpoint. Digging deep down into the heart of what our story is about. This song moves me more than any other and connects to those Joshua moments. Streets, etc. Don't tell me U2 can't touch those places because it's right here in front of your eyes. They evolve and always reconnect with the essentials of the human heart. Listen with your eyes closed. <br /> <br />8 - All Because of You.   Okay - the slingshot. This album's version of The Fly. If LPs were still around, this would be side two now. Amp up and get ready for the second half. Muscular and a real kick in the pants. If you wear them... <br /> <br />9 - Miracle Drug.  How this got placed second is beyond me. It's one of the natural closers, only we have so many you have to sort them all out. The stakes need to keep getting higher and higher. But watch. It transitions beautifully because it starts slow, ends flying and leaves room to go still higher. <br /> <br />10 - Yahweh.  Yeah, I know. It works where it was. Well, if you really listen though, it isn't really the capper. No - it functions better as a pseudo-capper. You kinda think the album should be over. But here's the twist - it's NOT. The ending line, Bono sings \\"Break my heart.\\" And we're about to, because next comes - <br /> <br />11 - One Step Closer.  Doesn't get any better than this as a dark swirling descent before we hit climax. Need to change the mood, mix in a kind of Unforgettable Fire moodiness merged with Love Is Blindness. But unlike Achtung, we're not going to leave this one dark. We've saved the best for last... <br /> <br />12 - City of Blinding Light. Edge's guitar comes ringing in from the darkness, and suddenly it's like the opening moments of Where The Streets Have No Name. This time love really DOES win out in the end. Always leave 'em crying out with joy if you can. <br /> <br />After that, the emotions can't go any higher. We've hit the lows, savored the journey, and left with tears in our eyes. U2 writes songs like nobody else, which is why we love them after all... <br /> <br />If I could wish one thing, it's only that the boys would consider their albums concerts and find the ARCS that always shows up in the arenas. People are waiting to hear what these songs will sound like later. You can sample a taste by simply reprogramming the journey on THIS album to meet that same emotional criteria. <br /> <br />It's just one man's opinion. One man who loves U2 so, incredbily much. But I live by story, and without that arc, I just can't pour out my heart the way many others might.  <br /> <br />But not now... <br /> <br />This is exactly the album I was praying the U2 gods for. Just had to tweak it a little. <br /> <br />See you in the heart. <br /> <br />
0790729652|5.0|michael keaton and director tim burton teamed up to make this award winning dark slick version of batman in 1989 and to this day everybody agrees its the only good batman movie and the only one to get a good rating by critics sadly michael keaton retired from film to be with his family more after shooting this film and all others who tried playing batman simply wernt cool enough buy this film and see why it was the smash hit of 1989 and that batman can be a hip dark cool superhero when hes directed by tim burton and jack nicholson well can u have a better joker than jack? i think not
B0001AP12G|1.0|Why do people listen to this mainstream rubbish?  Why does everyone automatically love everything that MTV plays???  Are you all robots? The ONLY good thing that may come out of this album is that Hip-Hop producers will get more credit than they are getting at the moment.  I bet you can't name any producers other than this [...].  People should know who the best producers are like DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Jay Dee.  Hip-Hop is all about image nowadays, not about the actual music, and it baffles me!    Please go and listen to some real Hip-Hop like Jurassic 5, Gang Starr, People Under The Stairs or Pete Rock.  I guarantee you if MTV played any of this real Hip-Hop, people would love it.  If you don't like any of it then fair enough (but you need your ears tested), please just listen to some Hip-Hop other than the sh*t on MTV.

B0006399FS|5.0|After losing my mother this fall, this album has become the  outlet to release all of my emotions.  When I first bought it, I turned down all the lights in my bedroom and played the whole thing straight through.  I cried to most of the songs, especially the beautiful \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on your Own.\\" As Bono lost his father and wrote most of these songs about him or the issues of death and survival, they all struck me in the heart.  These songs cradled all of my emotions I was feeling.   <br /> <br />\\"Miracle Drug\\" made me appreciate the love my mother had given me. <br />\\"Sometimes\\" made me realize how much I missed her and our past experiences together. <br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" reminded me of her outer and inner beauty. <br />\\"All Because of You\\" is like a dedication to her while letting out my anger about her death. <br />\\"One Step Closer\\" covers the broader topic of death. <br />\\"Yahweh\\" is a prayer that closes everything. <br /> <br />THANK YOU SO MUCH U2 FOR GIVING ME THIS! IT HAS AND WILL GET ME THROUGH THE TOUGH MONTHS AHEAD!
B0006399FS|1.0|1- Bono: Cheap used words, pretending ( once again ) to fans believe any new U2 album is the best one. <br /> <br />2- Empty Promises: \\"a raw and rock album\\", \\"very direct\\", \\"the most sonic album since Joshua Tree\\", etc. <br /> <br />3- Marketing: Album leaked, stolen album ( give me a break ), iPod, Collector's editions, Apple Tunes, etc. <br /> <br />4- Band Beliefs: U2 still believe ATYCLB was the best album from 1980 - 2000, hating Pop yet. They wrongly though ATYCLB was their best album just because won several grammy awards and it sold 11 million copies. <br />Moreover, Bono still believe his voice is so perfect, crisp and clear, with a rich range, etc, if he were 25... <br />Edge believe that using the same guitars fans will be hypnotized again and again. <br />HTDAAB is only a clone from ATYCLB. <br /> <br />5- Some fans: Some fans aren't smart at all, because of all their \\"AWESOME, BEST U2 ALBUM, I LOVE EVERY U2 STUFF, HANDS DOWN !!!\\", etc the band don't care anything about to improve to themselves, as musicians, as composers, as producers, as singers, etc. HTDAAB is the perfect example of that mediocrity. <br /> <br />Maybe this album will be the new Rattle & Hum for U2, and that's good, because they must dream it all again...
B000687M48|2.0|Fallen is an incredible album. But why a live album already? I couldn't get into it.
B0002TT0NW|1.0|I loved reading the books, and loved the first two movies.  The first movies were visual feasts.  This third one is a disaster.  It's all dark, there's practically nothing to be seen because it's all gray on black and black on black, faces and scenes flick in and out within these murky images, and the whole thing is  as boring as can be.<br /><br />Please bring back Columbus's earlier magic. Please.<br /><br />It's a shame they won't have the budget to re-film this one decently.
0786711647|5.0|This is one of the most suspenseful, most enjoyable books I've ever read. How tired I was on 3 workday mornings because I'd stayed up late reading this book, unable to put it down - only 3 mornings because I read it all in 4 evenings. This book is too good to give away any of the plot. Reading it, I felt I was watching one of Hitchock's best movies playing in my brain. There's a point about 1/3 through the book where I stopped dumbfounded and said to myself \\"no way - that can't be\\", and then thumbed through the pages I'd just read to confirm it *was* true. An absolutely ingenious element left me feeling like I was starting from the beginning after reading 1/3 of the book. There are many other twists and surprises in this story, too, and the subject matter is surprisingly contemporary.  <br /> <br />I can't imagine anyone not loving this book.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I was surprised when I heard that Michael was going to be releasing a BOX SET this year. I hoped it would have all the hits that I've enjoyed thru out my life. Well I was surprise to tell you that I got more than what I expected. I got Unreleased tracks, Rare demo and of all things, that rare live concert from HBO. I remember that concert breaking HBO's record for the most people tuning to watch their station of all things, I was set for the Holidays! <br /> <br />...I did have to go on a hefty search to get \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" which started on 11.16.04 and ended 11.17.04...here goes...I was told by Circuit City that they would have MJ's Box set on sale on 11.16.04, so as a music fan who appreciates great...let me correct that...Quality music, i got off work and took a taxi to get to Circuit City before closing time to pick up the Box Set but to my discuss, they tell me that the album is on BACKORDER!...which is good for sales but I'm left with no BOX SET man!...I  took the loss as a trooper and tried again the next day 11.17.04.... <br /> <br />Second try...I come from work to take the train to Best Buy because they state that they have the album there. As you can tell my hopes are up again. I get off the train run into Best Buy down the stairs to the music/cd section (I actually bumped into 3 customers who were all polite to my surprise) and I see no box set, no Biggie...I ask a sales person there and to my surprise he tells me...\\"Ohh, that new Box Set by Mike?..It's sold out man, sorry\\"...I was thinking to myself I should have just ordered online and save myself the trouble but the sales man gave me an alternative. He said \\"If you really want to get mike new album, you can try the VIRGIN MEGA STORE in Times Square\\"...I was walking away from the sales person and thanked him when an guy who was with his girlfriend stopped me and asked \\"Mike got a new album out?\\"...I told him \\"yeah\\" (..thinking to myself again, bad promotion from SONY but it's MJ's last albumfrom them so whatever)...we actually spoke about Mike for a good min or two about how he's still the MAN and all that good stuff...The guy actually gave me a pound (ghetto hand shake) and thanked me for \\"supporting legends on the music industry\\"...I was ampped after the whole conversation and made it clear that i was going to get this BOX SET that day. <br /> <br />Third and final try...I take the F train to Times square walk about 1-2 long blocks and rush in to the entrance and to me delight, Michael Jackson-The Ultimate Collection is staring me in the face sitting there on the \\"new Release\\" stand shrink wrapper with the Logo and art work in Gold and ready to come home!...Man As soon As i picked up my copy, I felt how HEAVY this Box SET felt and I've never been so happy to buy Michael's last album... <br /> <br />`Til this day, I don't leave the house with out listening to MJ's The Ultimate Collection, I have my system set to max when I listen to mike after a hard days work. This The Ultimate Collection was made for my Surround System, even my neighbors don't complain about the walls vibrating! What a great way to end my story...thank god for Mike, he to me is definitely the \\"King Of Pop\\" and I'm at a loss of words when I'm just sitting back listening to this mans voice...I truly own an actual Ultimate Collection of music. <br />
B0002XDODU|5.0|I thought Rammstein would have a hard time putting out an album of equal quality as Mutter.  I must say that Reise, Reise one of the best, and I personally think it  is the best Rammstein Album.  Ohne Dich, a song on this album, I think is one of the best love songs I have heard in a long time.  One can see and feel the emotion, the loneliness and longing in the song.  As a animator and web developer I love creativity, Rammstein delivers both technically and creatively. It is one of the best works of art I have had the pleasure of listening too.  .  Reise, Reise has a rich traditional Navy background (seagull, accordion) with industrial metal.  With military pride felt in the music, it is fantastic.   But watch out you might feel the Ocean spray if you let your imagination go.      <br />If you don't know German, Take a course.  It enhances the music and you will get the most out of the music.  There is a feel per say in the language that go's far beyond simple translations that has much more meaning.  With that, I'll copy a few lines from the song Dalai Lama:   <br />Komm her, bleib hier <br />Wir sind gut zu dir <br />Komm her, bleib hier <br />Wir sind Brder dir <br />Guten Abend!  <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|This album sounds like U2 went back in time and wrote an album just after The Joshua Tree instead of releasing the hodge-podge that was Rattle & Hum.  Although I like Rattle & Hum, this album really reflects what would have been a natural progression for U2's style during that time period.  Yet in a way, it plays like a guided tour of the best sounds U2 has offered up over the years. <br /> <br />The real gem on the album is 'A Man and A Woman'.  The throbbing bass line and the simple acoustic guitar part - it's just all exactly what U2 have always been.  It's like a song from the eternal U2.  I see this as the 'One' or the 'With or Without You' of this album.  Whereas 'Vertigo' is the 'Mysterious Ways'.   <br /> <br />Another great thing about this album is the understated approach to politics.  Despite the overt title to the track 'Love and Peace or Else', there is a double-meaning extending to all relationships in the lyrics.  Bono, in his wiser years, has learned that with all of the things he actually does for his causes, he doesn't need to preach about it in his songs.  When I saw the title of this song, I thought - 'oh boy - another message from Bono', but was very happy with this - it's a kick ass song from U2. <br /> <br />For those who keep writing that they wish Daniel Lanois had been involved, you may wish to check the liner notes.  He and Brian Eno produced 'Love and Peace or Else'.  Lanois also co-produces 'One Step Closer' with Chris Thomas.  He's also playing Mandolin on 'Yahweh'.  As such, I believe this album is a kind of a U2 'best of' production effort.   <br /> <br />Frankly, the only song that sounds overdone is 'Original of the Species'.  But production is not the real problem of the song.  There aren't enough connecting pieces to hold the verses, bridges and chorus together.  Thematically, it sounds like a collage U2 piece.  It's the only song on the album that I would describe as 'U2 by numbers'.  It just seems like Bono didn't have enough time to really glue together the lyrics into something cohesive.  There are good ideas and good lines, but they seem to be taken from different song ideas. <br /> <br />Having said that, this album also has touches that echo the influences of 'Achtung Baby' as well as 'Zooropa'.  All in all, this album is a more successful effort of what they seemed to be trying to do with 'Pop'. <br /> <br />For those who don't like U2, don't bother with this album.  It won't change your mind.  For those who want to hear U2 for the first time, this would be a great starting point.  For those who like a song by song approach, here are my impressions of each song: <br /> <br />Vertigo - This is the obvious first song.  Sounds like it would've been a good track from 'Achtung Baby'.  Very catchy.  I thought I wouldn't like it when I heard the iPod commercial.  But the chorus changes character completely when coupled with the driving verse. <br /> <br />Miracle Drug - The long distance 'good' cousin of Nine Inch Nail's 'Perfect Drug'.  A song straight from 'The Joshua Tree'.  Beautiful chorus.  Vintage U2. <br /> <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own - Made me examine my own relationship with my father.  Transcends pop and finds itself planted into 21st Century culture.  Just a great honest song that's rarely heard these days. <br /> <br />Love and Peace Or Else - Kick's ass.  This is the offspring of the marriage of the gospel soul of 'Rattle and Hum' and the electro-pop of 'Zooropa' with the latent genes of Led Zeppelin. <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights - A simple, driving pop song.  Quirky bridge.  Fits right into 'Unforgettable Fire' era fare. <br /> <br />All Because of You - Starts with one piercing guitar shot.  Then, there's this complex guitar pattern that erupts into straight-up rock.  Basically, this is a perfect rock song - not just a U2 song.  This is 21st Century music.  The Beatles and The Who put in a blender. <br /> <br />A Man and a Woman - 'Where do we go from here?' Bono sings on 'Endless Deep' from the B-sides part of their Best of 1980-1990 album.  This song provides the answer.  Vocal melody also nods to 'Love Comes Tumbling'.  Beautiful and soulful. <br /> <br />Crumbs From Your Table - A song straight from the 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' play book, both musically and thematically (lyrics).  A nice companion piece to 'When I Look at the World' from that album. <br /> <br />One Step Closer - Atmospheric.  A good linking track that pulls together the driving force behind the first eight songs and the final lap.  An album track that acts as glue for the rest of the album.  Less quirky than 'Passengers' material, but easily could've fit in on that album.   <br /> <br />Original of the Species - Touching song that sort of tries too hard to be a 60's rock song.  It's mellow one moment and then hits the U2-stratosphere button the next.  Then back down.  It's a musical roller-coaster.  Lyrically, it's as if three different song ideas were pieced together.  If ever there was a filler U2 song, this is it.  U2's first undeniable dud. <br /> <br />Yahweh - Yahweh is a Jewish word for 'God' for those who aren't sure about that.  I thought, with the title, we would be hearing a sermon from Bono, but the spirituality here is earthy, it's about rebirth, a great theme for this band.  The verse lyrics here are sung by Bono & The Edge.  'Always pain before the child is born' in the chorus is a hopeful message that I think we could all use right now. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005U11Z|1.0|I've been a fan of Journey for over 25 years...this incarnation of Journey, my friends, is less than.  The production is flawless, and thus, the 1 star rating. <br /> <br />The recent rash of 5 star reviews has been due to fans from the official H Journey message board padding the review stats here.  The Journey 'Street Team', as they call themselves - discredit everything that Steve Perry has done, and totally WORSHIP Steve Augeri... <br /> <br />The new singer on this DVD, Steve Augeri - former singer of Tall Stories, and the subpar Tyketto - can't seem to hit the notes that 'The Voice' can. <br /> <br />And although the NEW songs aren't neccesarily 'bad', they can't recapture the magic that was once JOURNEY. <br /> <br />So please look at these reviews with a skeptic eye.  These are biased, Steve Augeri puppets.....
B000001DTM|5.0|U2's \\"Achtung Baby\\" release from 1991 came out as the whole grunge/alt-rock scene was exploding, but their shift in sound was relevant. This band has always been involving and reinventing, and this release is no exception. It's grittier and edgier than previous releases, but also contains some moving songs.<br /><br />The opener \\"Zoo Station\\" is so distorted that you might think there is something wrong with your disk player or speakers. This is just the kickoff to a powerful set that includes \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing,\\" the beautiful and moving \\"One,\\" and one of my personal favorites, \\"Until the End of the World.\\" I love the sound of The Edge's echoing guitar chords. Great at high volume! Bono's vocal is excellently understated. Track five is semi-ballad, with distorted guitars, but a nice melody, \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\" even has a little \\"sha la la\\" homage to fellow Irishman Van Morrison. \\"So Cruel\\" slows things down a bit, but then the amps kick into overdrive again with the catchy \\"The Fly\\" and the commercially successful \\"Mysterious Ways\\" with it's wah-crunch guitar and belly-dancing imagery...and visuals from the videos and concerts. The final four tracks are not bad, but tend toward experimental and not with melodies that really stay with you. I like \\"Acrobat\\" but it's similar to \\"End of the World.\\" The closer, \\"Love is Blindness,\\" as with most U2 releases, is a spiritual, meditative piece, complete with church-like organ. This is one of those you need to go back and listen to again.<br /><br />In conclusion: A classic disk that reveals new elements with repeated listenings. The best of U2's 1990s material.
B000002BE9|2.0|I have a lot of respect for Ms. Fiona. However.. I was very disappointed over Tidal after hearing the magnificient When the Pawn.  It is clear how much Fiona has evolved between those two albums, because on Tidal she can barely form a tangible melody--her voice tends to jump. <br /> <br />The only song that is fully enjoyable is Criminal, with it's light-hearted jazz-rock beat and Fiona's voice gliding across the melody. She performs it very well.  On the other hand, \\"Sleep to Dream,\\" the opener of the album, sounds like an experimental hip-hop track.  \\"Never is a Promise\\" is earnest but too self-righteous to touch listener's minds.  \\"Carrion,\\" the closer, is really jazzy but does not hit an emotional note. <br /> <br />If you want to enjoy Fiona Apple at her best, I reccommend When the Pawn Instead.
B00023BLV2|1.0|This DVD version (Pro-Active Entertainment) is complete garbage. The video transfer is so horrible it looks like it was taken right off a VHS tape. Also, the audio is not in Dolby Surround, but MPEG-2 (which simply means its in two speaker stereo). Avoid this version at all costs. If you want to purchase this movie, buy the version from Lionsgate/Fox which has a superior audio and video transfer. You won't be disappointed!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Back in the day, if you wanted a Beatles sampler that covered their entire careers, you had to commit to the two volume Red and Blue albums, each of which contained two LPs. Nowadays, you have a better choice. <br /> <br />This CD collects all the Beatles' songs that were Number One on the British or American charts. Before you complain that there's only one disc here, please note there are 27 songs. That's 27 Number One hits. Expand the definition of \\"hit\\" to the Top Ten and we'd have a multi-disc set for a band whose recording career lasted roughly 8 years! <br /> <br />Kids getting interested in the Beatles (and there are a lot of young people out there who are interested in the Beatles) can start off with this collection, which contains most of the Beatles songs in heavy rotation on the radio. It presents a cross-section of the many styles the Beatles played, from fast riff rock to ballads to novelty tune, to their patented Beatles harmonies. Bear in mind that these are merely the most commercial songs the Beatles recorded. The Beatles also sang psychedelia, raga rock, hard rock, nostalgic tunes, and folk rock as well as being gifted cover artists. (\\"Twist and Shout\\" anyone?) <br /> <br />If you try this and like it, there's plenty more where that came from!
B0006399FS|5.0|I don't get all the bad reviews but each is own.  I actually like the bad reviews, some u2 fans here seem ticked off by them.  It just shows the different music u2 have brought us over the years and fans aren't going to like every version.  But on the other hand, it seems some are expecting another \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" from the boys, and that won't ever happen.   <br /> <br />It just amazes me how u2 keep doing it.  I love this album...I think a majority of my friends think it's a good album and what they expected from the band, a \\"safe\\" album.  I might agree that it is a little safe but I still think it's overall a very great effort by the Irish band.  <br /> <br />HTDAAB Highlights: All Because of You, City of Blinding Lights, Original of the Species, Miracle Drug.   <br /> <br />\\"Vertigo\\" is awesome but I've heard it too many times now on the radio and through that I-tunes commercial.
B000002O3I|5.0|This is the most essential single Howlin' Wolf CD there could possibly be and would make an excellent first purchase for a Howlin' Wolf novice. It comprises The Wolf's first two long-player releases, both what we would now regard as compilations, and was put out by Chess/MCA in 1986.<br /><br />Moanin' In The Moonlight came out in America in 1959 and was made up of 12 selected A-sides and B-sides from the many 78's he released between 1951 and 1958, all monaural, including such classics as Smokestack Lightnin' and I Asked For Water (She Gave Me Gasoline). The LP kicks off with Moanin' At Midnight and How Many More Years, comprising both sides of his first Chess single, recorded in Memphis by Sam Phillips at what would become the Sun studios, long before Howlin' Wolf moved to Chicago. The songs on this LP are among the most elemental, eerie and powerful pieces of music ever committed to tape.<br /><br />Equally compelling is the second collection, usually known as the Rocking Chair album, released in the US in January 1962, when the genre was presented as the root of \\"Music Americana\\". It contained 3 previously unreleased songs recorded between May and December 1961, and 9 that were on 45's released in 1960 and 1961 (though two were recorded in 1957), but all in stereo.<br /><br />Famous songs include The Red Rooster, Wang Dang Doodle, Back Door Man and the Wolf's famous variation of Spoonful (he would have learned the original, fairly dissimilar Spoonful Blues from Charlie Patton) - though all staple fare for a million blues and rock bands ever since, none could match the intensity and darkness of these originals (although the Rolling Stones' Little Red Rooster came close). Most were written by Willie Dixon, who plays bass throughout, though there are a couple credited to Howlin' Wolf and a cover of St Louis Jimmy Oden's Goin' Down Slow, on which, unusually, the recitation is spoken by Willie Dixon.<br /><br />The division of stereo and mono recordings is not declared anywhere on the CD and seems somewhat arbitrary, especially since Who's Been Talkin' (stereo), Tell Me (stereo) and Somebody In My Home (mono) were all recorded on 24 June 1957.<br /><br />A note in the sleeve reads, \\"In our effort to bring you the originals for the cost of a single CD, we have omitted one selection due to the length of the combined original albums.\\" Given the playing time of 66 minutes this is a very irritating message, but in my quest to discover the identity of the missing selection, after consulting several online discographies as far as I can tell it seems that all tracks are present and correctCD and seems somewhat arbitrary, especially since Who's Been Talkin' (stereo), Tell Me (stereo) and Somebody In My Home (mono) were all recorded on 24 June 1957. <br />A note in the sleeve reads, \\"In our effort to bring you the originals for the cost of a single CD, we have omitted one selection due to the length of the combined original albums.\\" Given the playing time of 66 minutes this is a very irritating message, but in my quest to discover the identity of the missing selection, after consulting several online discographies as far as I can tell it seems that all tracks are present and correct
B000002L99|3.0|With departure of David Lee Roth, Eddie Van Halen brings in veteran rocker Sammy Hagar, who once was involved in a good record with Ronnie Montrose back in the early 70's, but I digress. With Hagar at the mic the band quickly record 5150, and album started with original vocalist Lee Roth, but finished with Hagar. The songs are an about-face step in the realm of pop metal with frat-boy sensibility, all wrapped up in the package of a serious musical statement. But don't believe it folks, this is pure pop metal with the Top 40 dead in the site of the band's aim. \\"Why can't this be love\\", \\"Love walks in\\", and \\"Best of Both worlds\\" are as poppy as you can be. There are no really great melodies at work here, but plenty of fine guitar from Eddie, as per usual. This album marks the bEST of the Van Hagar era.
B0006399FS|2.0|This album is boring and slow.  Nothing really \\"rocks\\", the songs are just plain dull.  Go buy the old stuff!
B00000J2SR|3.0|1983's Bent Out of Shape is more highly polished chrome from the dark guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. As the 80s went Rainbow's sound became less rabid and more radio friendly. Not all is bad with this, however. Aside to the mediocre lyrics of Joe Lynn Turner, Blackmore music is alive and well and surviving quiet nicely in the pop-metal genre. It's not the Turners lyrics are bad, it's just that they never really inspire. They're not great, but they won't sink the music, either. The bands fine sense of melody is not lost here. \\"Can't Let you Go\\" has a fine hook delivered by Blackmore and a nice strog melody in the chorus by Turner, \\"Street of Dreams\\" is easily the best work on the album, with melody, and lyrics working well. The added programmed synth is done very tasteful and stays deep in the mix with one having to really take notice of it. \\"Anybody There\\" is another very nice slow Blackmore instrumental, with Pink Floydish chord progression. The opening \\"Stranded\\" comes complete with a radio friendy lick and lots of Turner heat. Overall a very good effort for the band. A nice change of pace from the rest of 1983's headbangin', hair teasin' lame metal, and funny sounding British accent haircut bands of the era. Nothing wrong with middle of the road here. Blackmore has NOTHING to prove anymore.
B0002F6BQU|5.0|This movie was extremely well-written, well put together, and just plain fun! Bob Newhart as Papa Elf was perfect for his role. Ed Asner was a great Santa Claus. Will Ferrell was terrific in his role as Buddy the Elf who goes to New York to find his father, played by James Caan. The magic of Christmas comes alive throughout this comedy. It is sad how cynical adults can be sometimes and forget what is truly important. Buddy's persistence pays off in finding his way into his new family's heart. A holiday classic!
B00005JN4O|5.0|LOVED IT!!!!  Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet were perfect together!!!  Fun for the whole family!!!  Look for the boy who plays Peter in Tim Burton's Willy Wonka & the Choclate Factory.  Johnny Depp will be playing Mr. Wonka.
B00007GZVS|4.0|Cate Blanchett powerfully portrays Elizabeth I, Queen of England. She is surrounded by a superb all star cast. The terror and fears of this age are rightly portrayed throughout the story. If one did not agree with Queen Mary they were sent to the Tower. Elizabeth herself was arrested. Queen Mary, a strict Catholic, however could not execute her Protestant half-sister. Upon Mary's death, Elizabeth became Queen. She rose to power when there was no army and no money in the treasury. Elizabeth as well had to battle the pope and her people's loyalty to the Catholic Church. Alliances were made and broken by marriage proposals. Spain, France, Scotland, and England were all locked in battle for supremacy. Her scandalous affair with Robert Dudley continued. There are several extraneous flashy scenes where the action flashes in and out, between light and dark, and still shots, to convey the drama. Overall I found this to be a worthwhile drama which gives witness to events of a turbulent time in history.
0380729407|1.0|In this book, Bradbury's writing is so infused with his style that if you don't like his style, the book is unreadable; whereas if you do like his style, then you are almost certain to love the book.  I don't like his style, but many people do.  Here's a sample which illustrates the style to which I refer.  It is the fourth paragraph in chapter 3:<br /><br />\\"What's the answer, he wondered, walking through the library, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, is it all in the whorls on our thumbs and fingers?  Why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves?  They stoke a furnace all their lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes and start it all in the crib.  Caesar's lean and hungry friends.  They eat in the dark, who only stand and breathe.\\"<br /><br />If you like that style of writing, or at least don't consider it pretentious, self-indulgent gibberish, then you will probably be able to find a decent read in this book.  I was able to make only about one-sixth of the way through before my annoyance with the style overcame my desire to read a good story.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|A deeply impressive film.  Clint Eastwood applies his art in a masterfully plotted, directed, and acted production.  It is classically constructed: a history, a crime, the search, discovery, recognition, the fall, punishment, (redemption).      Look at the scene with Tom Robbins and his wife while he is trying to confess to her, and then compare it with the penultimate one with Sean Penn and his wife, (\\"You are the King, the King loves his children, and has to protect them. . . \\")  Chilling and profound.      This work has the roar in the register of a Thomas Wolfe novel (of Look Homeward Angel, *not* of the I am Charlotte Simmons)
B000002UD0|5.0|Walls and Bridges is an album of great genious.  It represents a dark time in John Lennon's life when he was separated from Yoko Ono.  There is of course the big story of Yoko being in the audience when John Lennon and Elton John sang Whatever gets you through the night.  The greatest song on this album is Nobody loves you when you're down and out.  What a great song that is.  Practically no song can beat that.  Scared is another brilliant song.  Dream 9 is more popular but still quite effective.  John Lennon was a great man and it shows on this album.  This is the same man who wrote songs such as Girl, Because, Strawberry Fields and many more.  He will live on forever.
B0000TB050|5.0|U2 is by far the best rock band ever to grace this planet anyway. So with that said, this DVD shows the passion and the incredible talent of U2. The camera angles are great and the music mixing is superb! This DVD will impact the way you look at this band for the rest of your life. They pulled in songs like Pride and One that were excluded on the Boston DVD which make this DVD even better. Watch for the segue into Where The Streets Have No Name. It made me honestly cry. Haha. Go buy this CD if you want to lay your eyes upon the greatest Concert DVD ever filmed by the greatest rock band ever invented!
B000687M48|3.0|It could be because the band got completely uprooted with one of the founding members leaving. This is many of the same songs with what the band sounds like now. You get the same songs as the first CD, but with the current version of the band playing them. Though to tell you the truth, I'd rather some new evanescence stuff.
B0006399FS|5.0|To ALL You haters -  <br /> <br />   You can't listen to an album once and then rate it! You people make me sick. I am a recent U2 convert (2 years ago) and if I would have done the same thing as many of these so-called \\"fans\\", that is over critize something at first impression then I would've thrown out the Joshua Tree! <br /> <br />  Personally, I fell asleep on the album when I first heard it (shame on me!), but you know what I gave it another try and now its one of my favorite albums (that & The Unforgettable Fire). So that is my point. GIVE IT SOME TIME, it'll blow ur mind! <br /> <br />  Besides, the fact that everyone is talking about this album means that U2 have actually succeeded in putting their music out there. You haters wont admitt now, but in 4 years u'll be hailing this as pure brilliant work - a precursor to their masterpeice that will shake the world.  <br /> <br />(And I imagine you haters will be crapping on that one too...)
B00005JMAH|3.0|I have yet to explore the DVD's bells and whistles, but I am disappointed before I even open the case.  What happened to the unique cases used for the first two films?  There is nothing wrong with the standard DVD case other than the fact that you have never used it for this series before. <br /> <br />I wish Warner Bros. would stick to what they started.  Of course, this probably drives sales of those high priced box sets.
068987474X|4.0|First of all, let me say that the title alone made me buy this book.  How funny is it?  Anyway, this is an amusing read, kind of a one hit wonder type of thing, but entertaining.  (How many chapters devoted to cads can you have?  Who knew there were so many different types of guys who are, um, just not that into many women?).  Who should read this?  Well, just about anyone.  Clearly the book is aimed at dating women who want to have serious, meaningful relationships and sure, it can help some get out of dead-end relationships, if they heed advice offered in books.  However, any woman who has friends that fall into that category should probably peruse this one.  If a guy is not calling your good friend, and she comes to you for advice, don't tell her she's so fabulous and wonderful that he's probably too intimidated to call her, tell her he's probably not that into her and that she should move on, don't waste the pretty and find a man who is really into her.  Also, for women in serious long-term relationships--reading this one will give you some light-bulb moments vis-a-vis those old, failed relationships.  And should guys read this?  Why not?  Tips on how not to be a jerk and what it does to women when you are.  Date responsibly, and all that.  Enjoy this one!
B00003CXAE|5.0|This movie still has grrove and meaning.  The musical numbers are still fresh, and the story is timeless.  Set in the 1950s, it deals with two senior high students who fell in love during summer vacation, and accidently meet again their senior year.  The cast is charming and the direction is vibrant.  Destined to be a Hollywood classic.  John Travolta was perfectly cast as the leader of the T-Birds.  Olivia Newton-John made a strong feature film debut in the lead.  Look for Stockard Channing as Rizzo.  She steals just about every scene she's in.
B0002F6AH0|3.0|This series was made by journalists from mostly newsreel films.  As a result it contains the standard journalistic mixture of important, trivial, direct falsehoods, and falsehoods of ommission with the absence of the remaining important information.     The general style is called \\"flash and trash\\" within the journalism community.  There are all sorts of photos of cannons firing but no or little coverage of the intellectual aspects of the war.  One example of a gross omission because of this is the D day landing.  It fails to explain that the reason for the initial lack of German response was caused by several things.  Through espionage it was learned that the Germans expected the landing elsewhere.  Elsewhere was bombed twice as much as everywhere else.  During the landing, the German radars were jammed at the real landing site and airplane carrying radar spoofing equipment flew to the expected landing site and made radar returns of a large ship formation approaching it.  At the same time the underground in France was signaled to attack and destroy all sorts of transportation networks.      This series was made before the really important information was declassified and the results of US decoding of Soviet spy messages was made public.  This latter information revealed that some of the people interviewed for this series were Soviet agents and the information they tell can now be seen to be Soviet propaganda.  The 'historians' interviewed are sometimes not the acknowledged first ranking experts.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The third in this series is the most dark.  Wee little kids may be scared by the several frightening images throughout the movie.  The special effects are splendid and the story is plenty suspenseful and eerie enough to please most fans.  I found the film a bit long, and started to lose interest a little bit in the middle.  It is long, as are the others so be prepared.  The acting is top drawer, the production values are grand, and the direction is steady.  Just be warned:  this one is scarier than the first two.  It may give little children nightmares.
B0006399FS|2.0|\\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was a great comeback for U2, and their first consistently good effort since \\"Rattle and Hum\\". Unfortunately, the comeback didn't last long -- \\"How to Dismantle An Atom Bomb\\" is stale, formulaic U2-lite, rendered by a band that seemingly has run out of ideas. Even the return of Steve Lillywhite as U2's producer fails to spark any magic. Oh, for the days of \\"War\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree\\".
B000022TSW|5.0|Stan Marsh, Kyle Brovlovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick have always been known to have potty mouths. But when The Terrance and Phillip Movie--a movie from Canada--comes in theaters, the foul language causes the boys to start cursing and swearing much more than before. The mothers of South Park are outraged. They're so outraged that they start a protest against Canada, and plan to have Terrance and Phillip killed.    The kids are crushed--there's no way they could let their favorite actors be killed. Especially when they discover that if Terrance and Phillip die, Satin and Sadam Hussein (who has recently died and gone to Hell) will rise onto Earth and the apocalypse will begin. It's up to the kids of South Park to save their favorite actors--and the world.    SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT may be one of the world's funniest movies. Sure, it has tons of curse words. But without them, the movie wouldn't be funny and it really wouldn't have a plot. One thing I really liked about this movie was that beneath all the swear words and sex scenes, there's an important message--you don't need to be big to do big things. The only problem I had was that the DVD should've had more special features. This is a must see for all South Park fans, and if a fan hasn't seen this movie, they're not truly a fan.
B00005RZV4|5.0|I'm not one who really likes live albums. I like the studio recordings a lot more, just as most people do. The only live albums or DVDs I'll listen to or watch (DVD) are those of Slipknot (they sound the same live as they do in the studio) and Nine Inch Nails. And All That Could Have Been is a collection of some of the greatest NIN songs made, and NIN does a great job playing them live. Sure, some of the songs on All That Could Have Been aren't as great as the recording, such as Closer, but most of them are just as good, or even better than the recording. This is a great live album, one of the best, if not the best I've ever heard before. Plus, you can get a DVD with it. The 2nd disk are recording-session songs, but they are so beautiful and emotional. Every single one is a masterpiece. I'll make it simple for you... buy it. <br />Disk One <br />1. Terrible Lie- 10/10 <br />2. Sin- 10/10 <br />3. March of the Pigs- 9.5/10 <br />4. Piggy- 9.5/10 <br />5. The Frail- 10/10 <br />6. The Wretched- 10/10 <br />7. Gave Up- 7/10 <br />8.

B00004T9UF|4.0|I like encore, and the slim shady LP the best but this is pretty good with songs like criminal, remember me, and stan, buy the album after you buy his 1st and newest one. This is better than his followup 2002's the eminem show though... and ps to the person that calls himself east nugga187, stop reviewing CD's, all hes on here to do is be racist and say how white people cant rap when they can, + he's probaby not even black, racist's arent cool, no matter what color, so stop reviewing CD's.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Jet prooves that local cover bands can get record deals to. all you need to do is write the worst lyrics in music, recycle an already good idea and add a splash of whatever is popular at the time. And there you have Jet in a nutshell. From flat out ripping AC/DC and Oasis to other rock bands that do it 100 times better. this album is ass on CD. It's [...] i tell you! MTV and the now generation will love this crap, But if you want to waiste your money pick up a copy of 80's ear pleaser Pac-Man Fever! atleast you'll actually have a peice of retro instead of a cheap immitation.
B00005MP58|5.0|My, my, my, words fail me.  <br />Breathtaking.. Colin Firth.... Masterpiece <br />Forget about all those Oscars, all those flash hollywood stars, blockbusters. This is THE movie you MUST NOT miss. <br /> <br />
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5's cd 'Songs About Jane' is a wonderful cd. I bought it about a month after their first music video was aired on VH1. I only listened to the first 4 songs until hurricane Francis and Jeane forced us to evacuate, i ended up listening to this cd so many times i had the whole cd memorized! It is a wonderful cd which blends R&B and Rock extremely well. Once you buy this cd, it will easily become one of your favourite cds. Or, if not, then you will love singing along to the songs from the cd as you listen in your car or home.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Journey is rock legend, and this DVD proves that the band never belonged to any one member. The music speaks for itself...in fact, it screams into the rock and roll history books whether you like it or not. The classic blues, the rich melodies, the incredible musicianship...all intact here. Mr. Augeri is a commanding force that takes this band boldly into a new era.
B00000DFSK|4.0|This CD is a collection of the best of U2's earlier work.  You can hear the evolution of the band in terms of the issues they deal with as well as their sonic manifestations.  Youthful energy gives way to wisdom and clarity.  I love the new material that U2 continues to generate, but this collection captures the essence of the band.  Music with a purpose.  Music that is art.  Music that is substative.
6305428557|4.0|Yes, it is a simple, uncomplicated story.  Yes, they could have developed the relationship between Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald a little more.  But despite its minor faults, this is one of my very favorite movies.  It's a wonderful story that could easily have remained just a local legend, but I'm glad it didn't. I found the interactions between the Englishmen and the Welsh villagers hilarious, as well as the continuing sabotage of the Englishmens' attempts to leave the village.  I thought the storyline about \\"Johnny shell-shocked\\" added just the right amount of depth without being overdone.  And the end of the movie was quite satisfying, as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe I'm just an old sap, but I enjoy this story.  And I love that they show the actual mountain/hill at the end, along with the children of the people represented in the film.  If you want to watch a movie that presents an engaging story without unnecessary embellishment, this is a good choice.
0393035158|5.0|Mr. Harris has captured the light of humanism in this book. From the first page, talking about a suicide bomber to the very last page of this book, everything makes sense. The book is very \\"to-the-point\\" on its emphasis that religious dogma is a dangerous thing and that religious fundamentalism and religious moderatism is one in the same, and both are dangerous to our society, both in the past as it was with \\"witches\\" in the times of the witch hunts and trials, Jews in Europe during the holocaust, and today as it is with the non-believers in almost any Muslim country.  <br /> <br />Mr. Harris does an excellent job in showing us his point of view, both using humor and being completely serious and sometimes doing that in the same sentence. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is a liberal minded, reasonable, scientific, rational, and fact based person. It shows us how \\"reliant\\" we are on scientific data in EVERY other realm of our lives, but on the bases of religion, we believe blindly because a book says so. Good thing the Chronicles of Narnia weren't introduced first, that's my though on it. <br /> <br />Thank you, <br /> <br />Bill West, <br />Santa Barbara, CA <br />
B00000I9MK|5.0|The story of B&S is the story of a band without the intention of selling music, who still became one of the most influential indie-bands. Deriving their name from a French childrens book named \\"Belle et Sebastin\\", Belle and Sebastian is by all measures a band quite outside the ordinary.     \\"Tigermilk\\", their debut album, was originally released on Electric Honey Records - a small label run as a part-time project by students of the Glasgow School of Art. Originally the label only had capacity to release one EP a year, but when Stuart Murdoch turned up with ten songs and eight band members, they decided to make this one a full-length LP. As the belles had to cover most of the costs themselves, the original vinyl LP was only printed in 1,000 copies, and even so the band still had problems finding buyers for them all.     Today Belle and Sebastian have fans more or less everywhere - the band even has a nightclub in Korea named to their honour. And when listening to \\"Tigermilk\\" one instantly understands why the band achieved such fame, more or less against their own will.     Although \\"Tigermilk\\" was the bands debut - recorded with both limited time and resources at their disposal - it still shows the belles at their absolute best. Though musically it lacks some of the range of the three-ep box-set \\"Lazy Lane Painter Jane\\", its consistency and timelessness made it a classic all from the start. One needs only to listen through the opening track of the album, \\"The State That I am In\\", to see what makes the belles stand out from everyone else. Sarcastic lyrics about human failure and tragedy is mixed with upbeat pop-melodies form the basis of most of B&S' music, creating their signature soundscape. Although seemingly stealing some of its sound from classic pop, \\"Tigermilk\\" still stands out as fresh and new - different from everything done both before and after it. Seemingly coming out of nowhere, \\"Tigermilk\\" still does not distance itself from its audience, but invites the listener into a completely new - yet recognizable - musical universe.     \\"Tigermilk\\" fuses the sound of The Smiths at the height of their creative power with the ideals of the indie/lofi-movement of the 90s,  creating - in all its simplicity - pop-music both more advanced and yet simpler and more truthful than anything done before it. The first listening might give the impression of a feelgood easy-listening album, but underneath it all lies a nerve equal to the works of Jeff Buckley and his like.    Though creating a universe of its own, distanced by a clear sarcastic tone, \\"Tigermilk\\" leaves the listener with the impression that this is something highly personal. The odd combination of lyrics and music leaves the listener unsure as to wether he should laugh or bawl.     Running the risk of ending up entangled in clichs, I daresay that \\"Tigermilk\\" stands out as an accurate description of modern life and culture; that the belles in their firm intention of creating an album completely unsuited of intellectual analysis (or commercial success for that matter), managed to create the album that described their own generation.       Sadly, at current point \\"Tigermilk\\" seems only a distant memory of the artistic capabilities of the belles, as \\"Belle\\" herself, in real life named Isobel Campbell, left the band in 2002 to focus on her solo career, and the band after their transfer to Rough Trade has started tuning their guitars and hiring professional musicians and producers - a move that has removed most of their original charm and created just another radio-friendly Scottish pop-band.    PS. Isobel Campbell is currently releasing on Snowstorm under her own name and has previously released on Jeepster as The Gentle Waves, both french-pop inspired projects and next door neighbours to B&S. Her Gentle Waves album \\"Swansong for You\\" is definetily worth both your time and money.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Okay, I love, love, love the Harry Potter books. So much that I was not planning on seeing any of the movies. But we watched the first one in school one day, and then you know the rest. I saw the second, and then counted down the days until HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN came out in theatres. <br /> <br />The second the movie starts (heck, you could tell from the previews), you know this movie is going to be a lot different than the previous two. It's a lot darker, and the new director seems to add some more realism to the movie (no, I'm not crazy. But something about the first two movies felt so...fake, whereas this movie felt a little more realistic) - I think its because the kids are in normal clothes most of the movie, instead of their Hogwarts robes. I personally liked the change, but I know a ton of people that didn't. <br /> <br />Anyway. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the best book in the series (so far, anyway), introducing a new character to the readers (and watchers, too). Sirius Black, the \\"bad guy\\" of the movie. He just escaped from Azkaban and he's coming after Harry. Because he wants to kill Harry Potter, and because he's just an all-around bad guy, Azkaban sends some of their guards - the Dementors - to Hogwarts to make sure that Sirius Black doesn't hurt anyone. The Dementors were one of the best additions to this film: creepy, yet not creepy enough to scare anyone. The idea behind them is a lot scarier than the way they look. <br /> <br />HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is a great movie - the best out of the three, if you ask me. The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, but all of them are, because the series keeps growing. Anyway, this movie is darker than the first two, with less comedic relief (though we still have Ron and the Weasley twins to come in with a few really good jokes/one-liners at just the right moments) and a generally more depressing feel to it. But you expect changes with a new director. Yes, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was different, and you know what? The next one probably will be too, because there's going to be another new director. <br /> <br />My favorite out of the three - highly recommended. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A+
B0000026NC|2.0|Anybody who has ever listened to Floyd will tell you that none of the songs were ever meant to be played alone. All of their albums are really one giant song, and to take away the most popular segments of the album and put them together in a seemingly random order is just awful. \\"Us and Them\\" doesnt sound nearly as smooth and powerful when it doesnt follow \\"Money\\". The songs are fantastic, dont get me wrong, and for a newcomer to Floyd this might be a decent way to see if you like their stuff. However, I don't listen to this album anymore because I own all of Floyd's CD's up till Water's split. In short, buy the real albums, not this one.
B00004SCX6|5.0|britney spears is one of the best entertainers of all time... she may not be the best singer but she is a great dancer and a brilliant entrepenuer.... her worst album (the 2003 lackluster IN THE ZONE) had to be her last because she said that she is not doing music for a long time... <br /> <br />OPPS...I DID IT AGAIN is just overall ingenious...the hands down best track is the title track... i dont know any artist that will seal their fate by singing about how they are going to win our hearts again... the first album is not all that great but she did win our hearts... it may sound like 'baby one more time' but this song is edgier... i love the video (one of my favs)... he dance moves are tight.... <br /> <br />'stronger', 'satisfaction', 'lucky', 'dear diary', 'one kiss from you', and 'dont come knockin on my door' are classics.... these songs had rock, r&b, reggae, and hip hop influence in each...  <br /> <br />overall this album is one of her best to date... this album is way different from her first effort... if you like different influences and done in a great way....buy this album <br /> <br />15 stars out of 5  <br /> <br />
6305949980|5.0|As an animated feature, Christmas movie, musical, goth fantasy, this movie delivers!  Danny Elfman and Tim Burton should just get married or have their brains fused together or something because whatever they touch together is genius.   <br /> <br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is an irreverant take on Christmas stories and the imagery and characters as well as music and themes are so wonderful and fitting.  And for a skeleton, Jack the Pumpkin King is hot!  It's an amazing and incredibly underappreciated movie that seriously needs to be rereleased on the big screen for Christmas so that kids who were too young to watch it (it might be a bit scary for kids under the age of 6 or 7) before can see what they've missed out on and anyone older who appreciates a good story and is tired of the same old Christmas crap (Jim Carrey's cinematic rape of the Dr. Seuss classic Grinch, the pathetically clunky Polar Express, etc.) needs to see it too.   <br /> <br />This movie is on my Top 10 list of the Best Christmas Movies of All Time.
B000002BQK|4.0|mariah carey is one of the best singers to date, hands down... there is nobody that can top her range in singing... but the thing with mariah is that she is trying too much in being black... we all know she is half black but she does not have to seem it all the time... <br /> <br />BUTTERFLY is her 2nd best effort to date (you are going to hate me but...GLITTER is the best). she changes the mood on this album quickly.... which is good because i dont like the same mood on albums... <br /> <br />the hands down best vocal song and the best song on the entire album is 'my all'... it is almost acappella... her voice sounds vulnerable and sexy.... just cannot explain the feel of this song... <br /> <br />'breakdown' f/ bone thugs n harmony is a hot one too...one of the best on this album as well... this song proably launched her into black and hispanic (and maybe weedheads) households as a true r&b/hip hop influenced artist...the harmonies with BONE and mariah are just brilliant... i love this song..... <br /> <br />'honey' 'the roof', 'baby doll', and 'the beautiful ones' are just instant classics... <br /> <br />the worst song on the album IS 'butterfly' this song quite possibly is one of the worst records of all time... i dont get it... the video the &#34;butterfly&#34; was the horse and the horse was flying&#62;? ohhh well... we all have bed times... the reprise 'fly away' is way way way way better than the original... <br /> <br />overall his album is one of her best efforts... <br /> <br />4.2 stars out of 5 stars
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|As great epics go, well, Troy isn't going to be one of them.  One of the major flaws of the movie, aside from the anachronistic dialogue (I can't stand it when modern pop culture phrases find their way into the scripts for ancient period pieces) was the bad casting.  The casting director I'm assuming was given this simple task:  Pretty people.  Don't worry about acting, just make sure they're pretty.    Okay.  Luckily in Hollywood you can find pretty people who are also good actors.  Unfortunately for Troy, very few of them are in this movie.      The two standouts are Brad Pitt (a proven great actor from Fight Club, 12 Monkeys, Legends of the Fall, Seven, etc.) and Eric Bana (I've only seen him in the Hulk, which was awful but not his fault so I'll pardon him).  The director must have given Pitt this instruction to guide him through the movie \\"Be an @sshole!\\" because that's pretty much how Pitt plays his Achilles.  You feel no remorse for Achilles when he dies because he gives you no reason to.  Bana, on the other hand, was the only shining point in the entire plundering film and after his death, there was really no point in going on.  Orlando Bloom who seems to make me less attracted to him in every movie I've seen him in since The Lord of the Rings trilogy, is a pathetic waste of flesh who is responsible for the death of thousands and the fall of his homeland for some other man's [...] wife and he is one of the few main characters that survives.  I guess the moral of the story is, the reason the world is so terrible is because the baseless cowards live on while the valiant and courageous die.      I could go on about the movie but there's no real point.  I only saw it once and don't want to see it again.  I'm currently living in China where DVDs are the cost of 1 U.S. dollar and I'm not even willing to buy Troy.  Even if someone gave it to me for free, I don't think I would bother watching it again.  So readers, you've been warned...
0385335482|3.0|basically, to me, it's an ok book.guess i'm being a bit cruel, since everybody around me said it's a great one. maybe if i hadn't heard too much about this book which made me expected more out of this book before i read it, i would have rated higher. i get a bit stressed out when the character just keep putting herself into trouble, and hey presto then she ended up with too good to be true luck (or should i say lucks?). but then again as i said, it's ok. a fun book. not exactly relaxing, but fun. and it's nice to know the insights of a shopaholic. what i like best about the character is how imaginative she is, but she didn't realize it, which turns out to be her potential.
B00005JN0T|2.0|After watching I, Robot, I had a strange urge to go out and buy, buy, buy!  Could it be all the shameless ads that were not so subtly placed in the movie's script?    The movie, loosely based on Isaac Asimov's book of the same name, has as much to do with the book as well I have as much to do with anyone else named Nikki.      Will Smith, having decided that after losing the Oscar to \\"the other black guy\\", he needs to return to the shallow blockbusters that made him famous (ie. Independence Day, Men in Black) stars in this forgettable mess of a 90 minute advertisement.  Wouldn't it have just been easier to skip the extras, other actors, special effects and just have Will prance around in converse shoes, drive his Audi and hawk all the other merchandise that glutted this film?      Oh Will, do you actually read scripts anymore or do they just throw you the big bag of money and the free kicks and you ride off in your Audi, rapping about how you don't curse.  You've sold your soul, my friend.  How does it feel?
6305428352|5.0|I was in high school when I was an extra in the movie.  There was a huge delay between when the movie was shot and when it was released like 2 years or so. It was a great experience to be in the movie. and when i saw it. I loved the storyline. I love to see areas in portland that were in the movie.  The seen when the girl was leaving for new york(bus stop) is a small corner store shop in the st. johns section of portland oregon. There was also a seen where we were at a prom but that seen never made the cut. I ended up being seen only at the end of the movie.  Im the only black guy playing onstage. I was playing a clarinet.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|First off I'd like to say that the Russian assasin/crooked cop who dies at the end of the movie is EFFIN' HOT!!  For dorks like me who watched Hercules/Xena back in the day, you may remember that actor as a blonde, he played the god Cupid (Eros).  Anway, back to the movie... <br /> <br />The main problem with the movie was that it was empty.  It lacked feeling and heart that made the first one so good.  Mostly, it lacked Franka Potente who was killed off in the first 10 minutes and that really just killed the movie.  That and bringing back Julia Stiles.  (Is she sleeping with the producer or something?  Whose idea was that?)   <br /> <br />Joan Allen is always enjoyable to watch (and I was digging her long hair.  It's refreshing to see a 40+ woman who can still rock the flowing locks.) and Matt Damon was on par with the first one but because there was no Potente, his acting seemed to be missing the onscreen chemistry that Potente brought to the story just as much as Bourne was missing Marie.  The only times his acting came alive was when he was looking at the one picture he kept of them together.   <br /> <br />The movie was okay but had they kept Potente, it would have been better.  They could have just had Bourne put her somewhere where she could be safe until the end of the movie where he could reunite with her again.  (she's in all of the books the movie is based on so I don't know why they had to kill her.)  I mean let's all face it.  The best scene from the first movie was that HOTT!! bathroom scene after Bourne cut her hair.  There was barely any skin (just a shirtless Damon) and you only saw them kissing and then the morning after but the two had so much chemistry that it was the steamiest love scene of any movie I'd seen that year.
068987474X|1.0|Is there a corollary to this book of profound fiction? I rather doubt it. A book titled \\"She's Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Gals\\" would undoubtly be too simplistic. What's to understand? The book would consist of one blank page. Whoopie! \\"Lou\\"
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Hands down the funniest movie of the year.  I'm glad to see Tina Majarino's career isn't completely dead now that her title as It Kid was taken over by Haley Joel Osment whose title was then taken by reigning It Kid Dakota Fanning.   <br /> <br />Anyone who thought the comedies of 2004 were bland and substandard should rent, buy or steal Napoleon Dynamite.  (Don't steal people, it's wrong and I was just kidding.)  That movie took me back to the glorious/awful 80s/early 90s of scrunchies, tapered jeans and unabashed bangs.  This is a must-see!
B00068IOWM|3.0|I bought the special edition book,cd,and album.   I thought that the book was a rip off.   It was nothing but mainly scribble and one page of photography.   The DVD is a keeper!   The special edition cd includes the extra song \\"Fast Cars\\". This song was great!   Here is my opinon of each song.     1.\\"Vertigo\\" This song Rocks! It is my antidepressant! It is a soul catcher like Elevation!   2.\\"Miracle Drug\\" This song grows on you and is a keeper! It sorta sounds like \\"Twilight\\".   3.\\"Sometimes You Can't make It On Your Own\\". An instant Classic!   Losing my step-dad in february with cancer makes it mean more. Emotional and powerfull!   4.\\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" This track is different, but catchy. A Good one that grows on you. This track sounds like it would come from ZOOROPA.   5.\\"City Of Blinding Lights\\" This song hopefuly will be released as a single. It took a couple of listens and I was hooked on the chorus. I hear a simular sound in the song that reminded me of \\"I Will Follow\\".   6. \\"All Because Of You\\" This is clearly the second fastest song on the album. A good song!   7.\\" A Man And A Woman\\" I didn't like this one. It sounds like Bono is trying to impress Norah Jones. A Bland One.   8. \\"Crumbs on Your Table\\" This song was weak with nothing to miss.   9.\\"One Step Closer\\" I liked this one! It was mello and you can sing to it.   10.\\"Original Of The Species\\" This is a weak song to me. The third song I didn't care for.   11.\\"YAHWEH\\" This song is Awesome! It is upbeat and spiritual!   12.\\"Fast Cars\\" This song was superb! Better than a B-side.     It took two to three listens to grow on me. Initial reaction was negative. Actung Baby took one listen to get hooked. Worth it! The Limited Edition didn't include lyrics or a CD case. It is hard to keep the CD safe. I also bought the regular album for these reasons. An Awesome Album!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Come on, any true Neil Young fan has Decade, and 80% of the songs on this \\"hits\\" CD are on Decade. Neil is testing us again, publishing a filler disc to make his contract happy. The first reviewer is on crack, some of Neil's best work was on his 80's experiments, including the classic Trans (no not \\"Terminator\\", did you vote for Arnold?) as well as \\"Neil and the Shocking Pinks\\" (no he wasn't wearing a white suit (it was _pink_ duh), are you color blind?). Not to mention Rust Never Sleeps, The Blue Notes, Freedom, Arc, Harvest Moon (one of his best selling albums, very emotional, not a \\"hawaiian druggie song\\" unless you're a soulless cretin) Sleeps with Angels, Silver and Gold, Are you Passionate, and probably his best work ever, Greendale. If you are new to Neil, you need to have a respect for irony, subtle double meanings, some patience, a strong sense of the eclectic, and alot of heart. Don't get me wrong, this is a great CD, but you ought to buy Decade and get 2 CD's and 3 times as much material (as well as most of the songs on this CD), for a little more money. Neil is a genius and the comic of the \\"Greatest Hits\\" DVD, with a movie of the album playing on a phonograph, is simply his sense of humour. How you choose to laugh, curse, shrug your shoulders, pretend you understand, or argue about it is up to you.
B00025ETIW|5.0|MCR is my favorite band right now! Their blend of fast, melodic punk riffs with harsher more dark and \\"gothy\\" lyrics is just amazing! GET THIS CD! And then go buy their older one \\"I Gave You My Bullets, You Gave Me Your Love\\"> DO IT! Right now!
B00005JNEI|1.0|This has to be the one of the worst videos ever, from the choppy editing, quotes taken out of context, to the \\"jump to conclusion without any facts\\" logic Moore voices throughout the film.<br /><br />Good article to reference for facts disputing Moore's scandalous attempt at character assassaination can be found[...]
B000148KK2|1.0|This material is meant for an artist liek Rod Stewart, and the funny thing is all teh standards he's been singing lately, belong to someone like Krall.  There's been a major COSMIC SCREWING for this to happen.  Too bad she didn't marry a more interesting songwriter like Alec Wilder, so at least she could plug some good songs.  A genious move on her husbands part...
B00002Z88D|5.0|BUY IT!!!  This is my second favorite metallica cd.  All of the songs on here sound so much deeper with the addition of the San Francisco Symphony.  The highlight of this cd for me was Fuel.  It sounded so aggresive and explosive.  All of the pre-Black Album material is awesome too.  All in all: Perfect.
B00068IOWM|5.0|U2 - How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb <br />(An Essay) <br /> <br />It's taken me a couple of weeks to be able to get down on \\"paper\\" exactly how I feel about the Bomb.  This has been an experience unlike almost anything I've ever had before.  But I've now heard the album enough times (around 60) to feel like I can be somewhat objective in my review. <br /> <br />I've been a U2 fan since 1988, and a huge music fan since the mid 70's.  I remember songs from the 60's when they were new songs.  Yes, I'm old ;)  U2-old.  You call it. <br /> <br />This was supposed to be a review.  But how do you just write a review about a life-changing album?  I don't know how long this feeling will last, but this album has calmed me, even more than Coldplay's Rush Of Blood To The Head. <br /> <br />I always considered The Joshua Tree a miracle of an album, with the best opening three I have ever heard.  It's still a miracle.  And so is this.  Which makes sense, because I consider it to have the best closing four I have ever heard. <br /> <br />The magic is back. <br /> <br /> <br />1 - Vertigo (8.5) - Very fun, and not very substantial rock tune.  This is just as fun as it was from the beginning, which surprises me.  Yes, Bono proved that the Edge can do the Hives and White Stripes better than they can, if that was the true goal.  It is very smart that they made this the lead single, because it sets everyone up to listen to the whole thing before they realize that the rest of the album is not really like it at all.  It sucks you in, and once it has you in its grip, the beauty of Miracle Drug envelopes you before you have a chance to complain that this isn't a hard rock album.  At that point you are now accepting that U2 is best at what they do best-- being U2.  And now you are very happy and open to finding out if the rest of the album is just as magical.  And then you find out that it is.  Since I've already started my Miracle Drug review... <br /> <br /> <br />2 - Miracle Drug (9.5)- It was quite obvious, even from the lousy beach recording, that this was destined to be a classic, on the level of WOWY and One.  Mark my words -- it will be.  I would love to see an embellishment of this song live, as was done with the other two.  I think there is so much there to work with live.  Bono can actually take off and fly with this if he feels like it.  I think this song, more than any other, will make fans of non U2 fans.  It's quickly become my wife's favorite song from the album, and she's not a U2 fan.  She does like the album, though, as does everyone, U2 fan or otherwise, that I've played it for.  If it weren't for the fact that it ends too soon, it would be a 10.  It still may get there, depending what they do with it live. <br /> <br />This is a great example of how the Edge makes perfect use of sparse guitar parts to reach emotional highs.  That simple ringing riff at the start of each verse is signature of U2 classics.  I am so happy that his ripping bridge solo before his four vocal lines was allowed to breath.  It's not buried, which is unfortunately sometimes the case with the production of some other U2 songs.  And, yes, people, that IS the Edge singing those four lines!  And when Bono joins in it is just perfect. <br /> <br /> <br />3 - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own (10) - This has grown big time for me.  In five years, we will be calling this the next \\"One\\".  As we have already seen hints of, this will become HUGE live.  The emotion is there.  It may appear to be MOR to first-time listeners, but U2 did add magic to it to take it to the next level.  Just listen in the headphones, and get swallowed up by the emotion.  Trust me -- you WILL love this song, if you don't already. <br /> <br /> <br />4 - Love And Peace Or Else (7) - I'm not a big fan of this sound.  I feel that this song is definitely overrated.  As many people suggested, it is NIN-like, but I am not a fan of NIN.  You can also hear some Depeche Mode here, but, although I am a DM fan, there are some songs from them that I don't care for much -- and this is the DM that I hear.  Having said that, this song has definitely grown on me, especially the second half, which has some amazing sounds.  This is definitely the next \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\".  Unfortunately, I often skip BTBS when listening to The Joshua Tree.  But, as I often said, U2 are an amazing band, touching such a wide range of people, because although people can usually agree that they love their albums, they often disagree why, on a song-by-song basis.  THAT'S why U2 is so universally loved. <br /> <br /> <br />5 - City Of Blinding Lights (9) - I loved this when I first heard it live, but the fist-pumping chorus didn't really grab me.  Now, it's my favorite part of the song.  A lot of people seem to feel that this has the best intro since \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", but I really don't feel that at all.  It has a nice buildup, but nothing touches that \\"Streets\\" intro, only matched by its outtro -- that's magical.  I love the guitar in this one, with the Edge basically using it as a horn section, if you hear what I mean.  Adam shines in this one, too, as does Larry.  Too many people have commented how Larry seems muted in this album.  Huh?  First of all, what do you want -- crazy drum solos serving no purpose other than to call attention to himself???  Secondly, he does exactly what he should do -- carries the rhythm along with Adam.  And he does it perfectly!  This would be great if it follows \\"Streets\\" live, and it closes the set before the encore, since it was mainly written about the live performance of \\"Streets\\" in the first NY show after 9/11. <br /> <br /> <br />6 - All Because Of You (8.5) - I did NOT like this song at first.  I thought (and still do think) that the chorus was way too simplistic.  But this song freaking rocks!  It reminds me of very old U2 -- I'm talking pre-Boy U2.  Listen to some of the demos and early performances to hear what I mean.  Butit is early U2 greatly improved and matured.  I'm pretty sure the chorus is intentionally simplistic.  But the Edge shines more here than on any song other than perhaps Mercy, which isn't *really* on the album, anyway.  And when was the last time you heard Bono scream like that in a song?  Never?  I now look forward to this song when listening to the album.  Wow.  I think it could be a huge single. <br /> <br /> <br />7 - A Man And A Woman (8) - This song is definitely underrated.  Yes, it is the most MOR song on the album, and I can handle one per album, but it is done VERY well.  Adam absolutely shines on this song.  As a matter of fact, despite what Bono says about this being The Edge's album (and he is classic Edge, here), this is *really* Adam's album.  He is awesome. <br /> <br /> <br />8 - Crumbs From Your Table (9.5) - Several magazine reviews were beyond crazy -- this should be a B-side?  Bull.  This is an incredible mid-tempo rocker.  Again, Bono dubs himself an octave separated (I'm sure there's a technical musical term for this), and as in every other song this is done to on this album, it works beautifully.  And I've never been a fan of this technique, a la \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\".  But what makes this song is the incredible guitar riff leading into the chorus.  This is jangling Edge guitar at its most enchanting.  The riff between versus is the second best thing about the song, and Bono's emotional peak in the last chorus of \\"I would believe\\" puts the stamp on it.  I used to rate this a 10, and it may reach that again if they do this live. <br /> <br />And the line, \\"Where you live should not decide whether you live or whether you die,\\" is my favorite from the album. <br /> <br /> <br />9 - One Step Closer (9.5) - This is the \\"Running To Stand Still\\" or \\"Promenade\\" of the album.  It is WAY underrated.  With a bit of modification at the end to make it blend into \\"Streets\\", this is a natural to lead into that.  Must be listened to in the headphones in order to get a real appreciation. <br /> <br /> <br />10 - Original Of The Species (10) - The first I heard from this, like many others, was the ten second clip from a radio show a few years back.  If you listen closly, the lyrics have changed -- Bono was singing over the recording with the current lyrics, and you can tell it was slightly different underneath. <br /> <br />Also, like the rest of the rabid U2 fans, the next I heard this was the acoustic performance at the iPod presentation.  I thought it had the potential to be one of the best songs on the album.  Through Bono's relatively weak, but heartfelt performance, and Edge's botched piano playing, you could hear a hit in the making.  That clip hinted of where the acoustic performance would lead. <br /> <br />There's a lot of talk about the Beatlesqueness (is that a word?) of this song, and yes, it is quite apparent.  But the Beatles never reached the emotional heights this song attains. <br /> <br />The Edge's classic jangling guitar pulls this along, beautifully tying in one of Bono's most earnest performances ever.  His inflections are perfect, and just the way he rolls around the phrases are so natural and heart wrenching.  This song is DRAMATIC.  This whole album is dramatic.  This has one of the best chorus they have ever created.  And the part during the final, incredible chorus where he actually expresses joy in an almost laugh, is one of his best moments ever recorded. <br /> <br /> <br />11 - Yahweh (10) - This is the best closer they have ever done (and I consider this the closer; not Fast Cars in certain releases).  This is a natural closer, for both the album and live.  They'd better play this live.  As a matter of fact, this is one of my all-time favorite U2 songs.  I loved it from the first time I heard it.  I'm not religious, but I do love the lyrics.  And the ohhhhs that Bono sings near the end ranks up there with his all-time best.  It just fits so perfectly.  This is such a gorgeoussong. <br /> <br /> <br />12 - Fast Cars (8) - When I first heard the looped leak, I didn't care for it much.  I'm not a fan of forced harmonies accented at the end of each phrase, as made popular in the hip-hop world.  I feel those are very cheap and lazy, and rather annoying.  But now that I've heard the full version several times, I think it's very interesting -- especially the second half.  There's no way they should end any version of this album with this song, though.  Yahweh should end all versions. <br /> <br /> <br />I will also rate a couple of B-sides, because I think they definitely deserve to be on the album... <br /> <br /> <br />13 - Mercy (10) - This is the most powerful and classic thing that they have done since The Joshua Tree.  It's a crime that this was cut because they didn't know exactly where to place it on the album.  A damn crime.  It's on my version of the CD, though ;)  It's raw, emotional, classic U2.  And at 6:30, it still just ain't long enough for me :) <br /> <br /> <br />14 - Are You Gonna Wait Forever (9.5) - Another B-side that deserves to be on the album (and is, on my burned version).  Great song.  Would be the best song on most other bands' albums.  Classic Edge guitar. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall - 10 (the sum is better than its parts).  This is currently my favorite all-time album, and The Joshua Tree held that spot for me for nearly 17 years.  This is just more consistent end-to-end (even minus those great B-sides).  To say that I am thrilled that they could have come out with such an album at this point is an understatement.  It has completely consumed my life for a over two weeks, now. <br /> <br />Is it a classic?  I think the chances are excellent, but we won't really know for years.  Time is a key ingredient for making something a classic. <br /> <br />But it is GREAT!
B0006399FS|1.0|Well, I'm free at last. I'm a Pop and Zooropa lover !!!. How brilliant, exciting and wonderful are the most underrated and misunderstood U2 albums !!!!. AT LAST people will value these excellent albums. U2 has fallen down. In fact I think that they have fallen since ATYCLB, which happens is that they promised to return to make a Joshua Tree, with that epic sound and all that, then people received to ATYCLB with great admiration and devotion , but now ( after 4 years !! ) they discover the fraud that was in ATYCLB hype, and HTDAAB is paying the consequences. <br />having listened during two weeks HTDAAB, I listened to Zooropa and Pop again... what difference!!!!!!!!!! I'm happy that finally fans respect and love these underrated and essential discs. <br />Now, talking about HTDAAB: first of all, isn't a \\"Bomb\\". Isn't a rock album neither. Many filler songs are here, like One Step Closer ( the new Grace ), A Man And A Woman ( failed attempt to make another Party Girl ) and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. Every song sounds pretty the same, except for Love And Peace Or Else, maybe. Overall album is weak and awfully nice. No need to mention Bono's performances. <br />If you're a new U2 fan, don't start with ATYCLB neither this one. Start with Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Pop and Unforgettable Fire instead. Save your money and listen to the most underrated U2 albums. <br /> <br />GOD SAVE POP AND ZOOROPA !!!!!!
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 - How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb <br />(An Essay) <br /> <br />It's taken me a couple of weeks to be able to get down on \\"paper\\" exactly how I feel about the Bomb.  This has been an experience unlike almost anything I've ever had before.  But I've now heard the album enough times (around 60) to feel like I can be somewhat objective in my review. <br /> <br />I've been a U2 fan since 1988, and a huge music fan since the mid 70's.  I remember songs from the 60's when they were new songs.  Yes, I'm old ;)  U2-old.  You call it. <br /> <br />This was supposed to be a review.  But how do you just write a review about a life-changing album?  I don't know how long this feeling will last, but this album has calmed me, even more than Coldplay's Rush Of Blood To The Head. <br /> <br />I always considered The Joshua Tree a miracle of an album, with the best opening three I have ever heard.  It's still a miracle.  And so is this.  Which makes sense, because I consider it to have the best closing four I have ever heard. <br /> <br />The magic is back. <br /> <br /> <br />1 - Vertigo (8.5) - Very fun, and not very substantial rock tune.  This is just as fun as it was from the beginning, which surprises me.  Yes, Bono proved that the Edge can do the Hives and White Stripes better than they can, if that was the true goal.  It is very smart that they made this the lead single, because it sets everyone up to listen to the whole thing before they realize that the rest of the album is not really like it at all.  It sucks you in, and once it has you in its grip, the beauty of Miracle Drug envelopes you before you have a chance to complain that this isn't a hard rock album.  At that point you are now accepting that U2 is best at what they do best-- being U2.  And now you are very happy and open to finding out if the rest of the album is just as magical.  And then you find out that it is.  Since I've already started my Miracle Drug review... <br /> <br /> <br />2 - Miracle Drug (9.5)- It was quite obvious, even from the lousy beach recording, that this was destined to be a classic, on the level of WOWY and One.  Mark my words -- it will be.  I would love to see an embellishment of this song live, as was done with the other two.  I think there is so much there to work with live.  Bono can actually take off and fly with this if he feels like it.  I think this song, more than any other, will make fans of non U2 fans.  It's quickly become my wife's favorite song from the album, and she's not a U2 fan.  She does like the album, though, as does everyone, U2 fan or otherwise, that I've played it for.  If it weren't for the fact that it ends too soon, it would be a 10.  It still may get there, depending what they do with it live. <br /> <br />This is a great example of how the Edge makes perfect use of sparse guitar parts to reach emotional highs.  That simple ringing riff at the start of each verse is signature of U2 classics.  I am so happy that his ripping bridge solo before his four vocal lines was allowed to breath.  It's not buried, which is unfortunately sometimes the case with the production of some other U2 songs.  And, yes, people, that IS the Edge singing those four lines!  And when Bono joins in it is just perfect. <br /> <br /> <br />3 - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own (10) - This has grown big time for me.  In five years, we will be calling this the next \\"One\\".  As we have already seen hints of, this will become HUGE live.  The emotion is there.  It may appear to be MOR to first-time listeners, but U2 did add magic to it to take it to the next level.  Just listen in the headphones, and get swallowed up by the emotion.  Trust me -- you WILL love this song, if you don't already. <br /> <br /> <br />4 - Love And Peace Or Else (7) - I'm not a big fan of this sound.  I feel that this song is definitely overrated.  As many people suggested, it is NIN-like, but I am not a fan of NIN.  You can also hear some Depeche Mode here, but, although I am a DM fan, there are some songs from them that I don't care for much -- and this is the DM that I hear.  Having said that, this song has definitely grown on me, especially the second half, which has some amazing sounds.  This is definitely the next \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\".  Unfortunately, I often skip BTBS when listening to The Joshua Tree.  But, as I often said, U2 are an amazing band, touching such a wide range of people, because although people can usually agree that they love their albums, they often disagree why, on a song-by-song basis.  THAT'S why U2 is so universally loved. <br /> <br /> <br />5 - City Of Blinding Lights (9) - I loved this when I first heard it live, but the fist-pumping chorus didn't really grab me.  Now, it's my favorite part of the song.  A lot of people seem to feel that this has the best intro since \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", but I really don't feel that at all.  It has a nice buildup, but nothing touches that \\"Streets\\" intro, only matched by its outtro -- that's magical.  I love the guitar in this one, with the Edge basically using it as a horn section, if you hear what I mean.  Adam shines in this one, too, as does Larry.  Too many people have commented how Larry seems muted in this album.  Huh?  First of all, what do you want -- crazy drum solos serving no purpose other than to call attention to himself???  Secondly, he does exactly what he should do -- carries the rhythm along with Adam.  And he does it perfectly!  This would be great if it follows \\"Streets\\" live, and it closes the set before the encore, since it was mainly written about the live performance of \\"Streets\\" in the first NY show after 9/11. <br /> <br /> <br />6 - All Because Of You (8.5) - I did NOT like this song at first.  I thought (and still do think) that the chorus was way too simplistic.  But this song freaking rocks!  It reminds me of very old U2 -- I'm talking pre-Boy U2.  Listen to some of the demos and early performances to hear what I mean.  Butit is early U2 greatly improved and matured.  I'm pretty sure the chorus is intentionally simplistic.  But the Edge shines more here than on any song other than perhaps Mercy, which isn't *really* on the album, anyway.  And when was the last time you heard Bono scream like that in a song?  Never?  I now look forward to this song when listening to the album.  Wow.  I think it could be a huge single. <br /> <br /> <br />7 - A Man And A Woman (8) - This song is definitely underrated.  Yes, it is the most MOR song on the album, and I can handle one per album, but it is done VERY well.  Adam absolutely shines on this song.  As a matter of fact, despite what Bono says about this being The Edge's album (and he is classic Edge, here), this is *really* Adam's album.  He is awesome. <br /> <br /> <br />8 - Crumbs From Your Table (9.5) - Several magazine reviews were beyond crazy -- this should be a B-side?  Bull.  This is an incredible mid-tempo rocker.  Again, Bono dubs himself an octave separated (I'm sure there's a technical musical term for this), and as in every other song this is done to on this album, it works beautifully.  And I've never been a fan of this technique, a la \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\".  But what makes this song is the incredible guitar riff leading into the chorus.  This is jangling Edge guitar at its most enchanting.  The riff between versus is the second best thing about the song, and Bono's emotional peak in the last chorus of \\"I would believe\\" puts the stamp on it.  I used to rate this a 10, and it may reach that again if they do this live. <br /> <br />And the line, \\"Where you live should not decide whether you live or whether you die,\\" is my favorite from the album. <br /> <br /> <br />9 - One Step Closer (9.5) - This is the \\"Running To Stand Still\\" or \\"Promenade\\" of the album.  It is WAY underrated.  With a bit of modification at the end to make it blend into \\"Streets\\", this is a natural to lead into that.  Must be listened to in the headphones in order to get a real appreciation. <br /> <br /> <br />10 - Original Of The Species (10) - The first I heard from this, like many others, was the ten second clip from a radio show a few years back.  If you listen closly, the lyrics have changed -- Bono was singing over the recording with the current lyrics, and you can tell it was slightly different underneath. <br /> <br />Also, like the rest of the rabid U2 fans, the next I heard this was the acoustic performance at the iPod presentation.  I thought it had the potential to be one of the best songs on the album.  Through Bono's relatively weak, but heartfelt performance, and Edge's botched piano playing, you could hear a hit in the making.  That clip hinted of where the acoustic performance would lead. <br /> <br />There's a lot of talk about the Beatlesqueness (is that a word?) of this song, and yes, it is quite apparent.  But the Beatles never reached the emotional heights this song attains. <br /> <br />The Edge's classic jangling guitar pulls this along, beautifully tying in one of Bono's most earnest performances ever.  His inflections are perfect, and just the way he rolls around the phrases are so natural and heart wrenching.  This song is DRAMATIC.  This whole album is dramatic.  This has one of the best chorus they have ever created.  And the part during the final, incredible chorus where he actually expresses joy in an almost laugh, is one of his best moments ever recorded. <br /> <br /> <br />11 - Yahweh (10) - This is the best closer they have ever done (and I consider this the closer; not Fast Cars in certain releases).  This is a natural closer, for both the album and live.  They'd better play this live.  As a matter of fact, this is one of my all-time favorite U2 songs.  I loved it from the first time I heard it.  I'm not religious, but I do love the lyrics.  And the ohhhhs that Bono sings near the end ranks up there with his all-time best.  It just fits so perfectly.  This is such a gorgeoussong. <br /> <br /> <br />12 - Fast Cars (8) - When I first heard the looped leak, I didn't care for it much.  I'm not a fan of forced harmonies accented at the end of each phrase, as made popular in the hip-hop world.  I feel those are very cheap and lazy, and rather annoying.  But now that I've heard the full version several times, I think it's very interesting -- especially the second half.  There's no way they should end any version of this album with this song, though.  Yahweh should end all versions. <br /> <br /> <br />I will also rate a couple of B-sides, because I think they definitely deserve to be on the album... <br /> <br /> <br />13 - Mercy (10) - This is the most powerful and classic thing that they have done since The Joshua Tree.  It's a crime that this was cut because they didn't know exactly where to place it on the album.  A damn crime.  It's on my version of the CD, though ;)  It's raw, emotional, classic U2.  And at 6:30, it still just ain't long enough for me :) <br /> <br /> <br />14 - Are You Gonna Wait Forever (9.5) - Another B-side that deserves to be on the album (and is, on my burned version).  Great song.  Would be the best song on most other bands' albums.  Classic Edge guitar. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall - 10 (the sum is better than its parts).  This is currently my favorite all-time album, and The Joshua Tree held that spot for me for nearly 17 years.  This is just more consistent end-to-end (even minus those great B-sides).  To say that I am thrilled that they could have come out with such an album at this point is an understatement.  It has completely consumed my life for a over two weeks, now. <br /> <br />Is it a classic?  I think the chances are excellent, but we won't really know for years.  Time is a key ingredient for making something a classic. <br /> <br />But it is GREAT!
B00068IOWC|1.0|Well, I'm free at last. I'm a Pop and Zooropa lover !!!. How brilliant, exciting and wonderful are the most underrated and misunderstood U2 albums !!!!. AT LAST people will value these excellent albums. U2 has fallen down. In fact I think that they have fallen since ATYCLB, which happens is that they promised to return to make a Joshua Tree, with that epic sound and all that, then people received to ATYCLB with great admiration and devotion , but now ( after 4 years !! ) they discover the fraud that was in ATYCLB hype, and HTDAAB is paying the consequences. <br />having listened during two weeks HTDAAB, I listened to Zooropa and Pop again... what difference!!!!!!!!!! I'm happy that finally fans respect and love these underrated and essential discs. <br />Now, talking about HTDAAB: first of all, isn't a \\"Bomb\\". Isn't a rock album neither. Many filler songs are here, like One Step Closer ( the new Grace ), A Man And A Woman ( failed attempt to make another Party Girl ) and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own.

B0006399FS|4.0|I like u2, but I was a little hesitant on ordering this album. I didn't really get into their last one, but I loved their 90's experimentation with great cds like Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop. But I've heard this one and it's really good. I think it kind of takes the flavors of all the different u2 styles over the years. I love \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On your Own\\" they should release them as singles. I used to love \\"Vertigo\\" but I've played it way too much. My favorite one by far though is \\"A Man and a Woman\\". Ladies, you'll love it! It's like a u2 R&B song, kind of different but really great :) Good job lads
B00005JL96|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  If you're considering purchasing it, you need to know this:  Disney (which distributes this film) does not sell movies on DVD forever.  Toy Story, Toy Story II, Little Mermaid, and Beauty & the Beast were all available on DVD at one time, but they aren't any longer.  If you liked this movie, buy it NOW, because tomorrow it may not be around any longer.
B000000WJK|5.0|This review is directed to people like me - 40-somethings who believe that music for the most part entered a vast wasteland at some hard-to-pin-down date, but it was sometime in the late 1970s.  Sure, you'll occasionally find a little something that keeps your interest, but nothing compares to the music of your youth.   Well, I'm here to tell you that your search is over.  \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" matches anything you've ever known and loved. <br /> <br />I had only a vague awareness of The Verve's music until recently, and knew nothing at all about \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" until about a month ago.  Since that time, I haven't been able to bring myself to extract it from whatever CD player I happen to be near (home computer, office computer, living room stereo, car).  Yes, it's become an obsession, but the CD is a treasured thing to me, a work of finely crafted beauty.  Every track, and they range from dreamy, sensual ballads to trippy psychedelia to bluesy hard-driving rock and roll, is a gem.  Ashcroft's vocals veer from tortured to anguished to hopeful, but they're always beautiful.  McCabe's guitar work has to be heard to be believed, but ALL the music is incredible. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have said, this album is reminiscent of Pink Floyd's best without necessarily sounding anything like Pink Floyd.  But it's impossible to make such comparisons, really.  The Verve, and especially this, their best work, has a unique sound.  I weep when I think about how most of the world (well, at least the USA) was listening to grunge and crap-pop in 1993, rather than this CD. <br /> <br />And while I'm talking about Pink Floyd, I remember the exact place and moment when I first heard \\"Wish You Were Here\\" back in about 1975, and I've never felt I would ever find an album that could replace it as my choice as THE album I would choose to have with me were I ever stranded on a remote island.  \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" may have done it. <br /> <br />Buy it.  It's not for everyone, for sure.  But there's an excellent possibility that you'll react like I did the very first time I heard it - my heart soared and my mind expanded.    <br />
B00004X0Q0|5.0|oh man, i remember when i bought this CD, a couple months ago, i put it in my car's cd player...and its still there. ATDI, is quite possibly the greatest, most influential band of all time. and this CD proves it. anybody who doesnt like this music is left in the past and just doesnt quite understand the musical genious behind omars guitar parts, and cedrics vocals that were thought to have only been sang by god himself.  <br /> <br />Best Song--Invalid Litter Dept. The song has a very deep background meaning, and awsome refrain...and lets not forget the last 2 minutes of this song-- ok, your listening to this song, so, mellow, so progrssive...then BAM! it hits you in the face like a fist holding a brick. this isnt your grandmas music, and this SURELY isnt death metal growls...this is real screaming kiddies, somtimes...when i hear him scream at the end its so good, i just want to rip my head off. thank you cedric <br /> <br />and if you like this CD, listen to The Mars Volta, theyre so complex,the guitar parts are so musicly genious, and the music is so deep, its like sombody shoving an explosive book in your brain and putting it on timer. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|This album gets better with each listen and grows on me more and more. The music is solid and U2 sound like they are actullay enjoying themselves while playing which is someting you don't always hear with other groups where it sounds like work sometimes with them and has even sounded that way on a few past U2 songs throughout the years. I like the sound of a group that souns like they are enjoying themselves. U2 are still relevant and still great. They are at a place where they seem to know who they are. Bono's voice does strain a little bit here and there because it's changed but it's better than a lot of other artist. His voice sounds like it's straining some on \\"All Because of You\\" which is keeping liking it a little more than I do right now but it's still a solid rocker and I'm liking it more and more. Some people call it an Edge record but Adam Clayton's bass playing is rocking and more predominant than on any other U2 album as a whole. Larry is playing great as always. People who are giving it bad reviews need to listen to it more than once to appreciate it and let it grow on them.  U2 are still relevant and this fits right in with their exceptional catalog including everything from Boy to ATYCLB. There are a few tracks that I could do without in their back catalog that's not different from anyother artisit out there new and old. This album is far superior than most anything else that is out there and popular right now. Most of the time when I turn the radio on in the car anymore I am constantly changing stations to find something I like.
B00005NKKY|5.0|One can immediately hear the maturity and subtlety that Paul  <br />Simon began to display in his songwriting for his Simon and Garfunkel records, and this album is an essential CD no matter what anyone says about it. It is basically a good time record, and if you need something to lift your spirits, then put this record into a pair of your headphones. It offers autumnal, even dark truths at times, but it is CERTAINLY the most fun Simon and Garfunkel record. The devastating yet strangely comforting song \\"old Friends\\" kind of sets the tone for the album, but the second half has no discernable link. In truth, it doesn't need one with songs that are as good and as upbeat as \\"Fakin' It\\", which has the ability to make anyone feel better about themselves after listening to it. At the time this album came out, concepts were all the rage, and in a way it was very wise of Paul to not try and hide the fact that he was in no way prepared to create an entire record of meaningful, lengthy, very deep songs. In this respect, he can in no way be compared to Robbie Robertson of The Band, whose album \\"The Band\\" was released a year after this came out, and that album opened up so many doors because its intelligence and depth was just as good as its musicality. But Simon and Garfunkel aren't The Band, or the Who, or The Beatles, and they in no way try to pretend that they are. Yet for an album with only two voices and one acoustic guitar, they make the most out of it and often times they make more than you see on the surface. Do the lyrics and phrases stand up as well today as Robertson's words do, and do they have as much depth and richness in them? Probably not. But that is looking at the record on the wrong terms. There is a different kind of depth running through this album, and a lot of the songs are stunning. \\"Save the Life of My Child\\" reaches a new peak of creativity, and the sonic experimentation that they were doing in the studio by this point must have been shocking at the time. I know I was chilled and stunned when I heard the first note. That is a great song, although it isn't as good as \\"OLD FRIENDS\\", which has beautiful strings and soaring harmonies from the two. The problem is that Simon never wrote like a madman, and he has no back catalogue like Pete Townshend or Paul McCartney, but he did have the ability to create albums, and when you just listen to the old singles individually, sometimes things start to sound meaningless. Remember though, these are fun songs and I welcome that. So listen to the new remastered albums if you want the real Simon and Garfunkel. Simon offers views in this album that range from life's childish circumstances to the sadness and dread of old age and finally to the harsh but inevitable conclusion of death. That could be depressing, but Simon has comforting words and music, the likes of which I have never heard before. There are times on this album that I think corniness starts to show through (what do two young kids know about dying and sharing a park bench and living in a silent fear?), and I think that their pushy \\"understanding\\" of old age and life's purpose becomes cloying at times. Listen to \\"Old Friends\\" and then listen to \\"Rockin' Chair\\" off THE BAND, and then you'll see the difference between head knowledge and sincerity (how Robertson understood old age and the fear of death at his young age was frightening, but the song sounds honestly real). \\"Old Friends\\" tells a tale, but it just doesn't have the intensity that powerful artists can give such deep and fascinating material. Another great tune is \\"Punky's Delimma\\", which even inspired me to create a cheerful politically relevant tune similar in theme to the song itself. Even for all of its shortcomings and embarassing length (this album will, in an almost guilty fashion, take up thirty six precious minutes of your time), the record remains uplifting and funny at the same time. As I said above, Simon cut his song cycle/concept short and just filled up the B-side with great Pop tunes, but mainly if you think you own all of the good songs on this album and are questioning whether or not you should buy it, DO BUY IT IMMEDIATELY! Listening to it as an album can make all the difference in the world, and the world also NEEDS albums that are not so deep and heavy upon closer inspection. After all, great albums are not judged by the lyrics alone are they? Enjoy.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I was elated when I heard this show was being released on DVD, as I sat enraptured in front of the TV back on that Saturday in 1985, my fourteen year old eyes glued to MTV, not wanting to miss a second.  This set captures the spirit of the day, as I was moved again by performances from Queen (who undoubtedly ruled the day), U2 (cementing their future status as best band in the world), Bowie (a terrific version of Heroes that he hasn't played quite the same since) among many others.  The sound and picture quality are vivid. <br />   My only gripe is the omission of certain performances for no good reason..why leave off Sting's haunting rendition of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" , a highpoint of the UK show?  Also missing is Neil Young's stirring sing-along 'Sugar Mountain', as well as Duran Durans performance of the then current number 1 chart topper, 'A View to a Kill'.  Led Zepplins non-appearance was a choice of the band, and I understand the Whos set is two songs short because of power failures, but the other gaps just don't make much sense.  I would have chosen the above three missing tracks over the very square REO Speedwagon or Beach Boys, but I digress.  I also wondered at the time why some of the then contemporary alternative acts didn't take part, like REM, The Smiths , Depeche Mode, or the Cure, to name a few.   <br />   This is all conjecture and matters little.  What we do have is a wonderful document of this great day in our memories, and beleive me, if you purchase this and watch it, it will take you right back to where your head was at 20 years ago.  And the price can't be argued with!  What are you waiting for?
B000301YY8|5.0|I saw James Blunt open for Lloyd Cole in Ireland in Oct 04, thought he was great so ordered the CD when released. The CD is excellent, it's one of the very rare CDs that I let play from start to finish, as all songs are good and some are amazing - \\"Goodbye My Lover\\", \\"Wisemen\\", \\"You're Beautiful\\" are my favorites. Hope he gets attention in the US, he really deserves it!
B0002DB52M|4.0|Director Lars von Trier is one of the originators of Dogma 95, which espouses using natural settings and eschewing artificiality (props, sound effects).  His two most well-known prior films are prime examples of the genre - \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" and \\"Breaking the Waves.\\"  What a shock \\"Dogville\\" is then, in which seemingly every aspect of Dogma 95 is violated!<br /><br />Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a young woman fleeing from gangsters who happens upon a small mountain town in 1930s America.  The town hesitantly agrees to take her in, and they soon use her presence to their advantage.  The conceit is the film's soundstage setting, in the manner of a play.  The feeling it engenders is of \\"Our Town,\\" only far more twisted.  The obvious question is why von Trier would abandon Dogma 95 and direct one of the stagiest movies possible?  Although an obvious answer is not forthcoming, even in his director's commentary, the format does have a noticeable benefit.  Namely, the film is perhaps as universal in nature as imaginable, which seems to be a goal here.<br /><br />Von Trier's abandonment of Dogma 95 undoubtedly irritated many.  However, \\"Dogville\\" is likely to alienate people in other ways, specifically by being a 3 hour presentation of a rather simplistic parable.  Is the film worthwhile, and who is likely to enjoy it?  Well, I can think of relatively few audiences who are likely to actually \\"enjoy\\" the film.  However, I certainly \\"appreciated\\" it - the film is mesmerizing at times because of its simplicity.<br /><br />Of course, \\"Dogville\\" has an incredible cast: Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany (looking far less frail than usual), Lauren Bacall, Bergman regular Harriet Andersson, Phillip Baker Hall, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Jeremy Davies, Stellan Skarsgard, and Chloe Sevigny.  In addition, the film explores some important basic concepts of human nature, particularly the idea of arrogance, and many scenes are undeniably powerful.  If you enjoy films that examine Big Issues, then \\"Dogville\\" will likely appeal to you.<br /><br />The film was honored at numerous European film festivals, but largely ignored in the U.S.  I don't think it's as skillfully made a film as \\"Dancer in the Dark,\\" but \\"Dogville\\" is not to be missed by adventuresome moviegoers.  Of interest, \\"Dogville\\" is the first of a pre-planned trilogy - \\"USA - Land of Opportunity.\\"  The second film, \\"Manderley\\" is in production and carries on the story of Grace, although played by Bryce Dallas Howard this time.  Nicole Kidman was reportedly not able to star in \\"Manderley\\" because of scheduling conflicts.  Can't wait for the sequel - Highly recommended.will likely appeal to you.

B000669GAI|5.0|People appear to be pretty retarded to call PJ \\"mainstream\\" or complain about the hits on this album. Of course there's no way they could put every song to please everyone one of their fans out there but when they make a \\"greatest hits\\" you should expect there to be some popular sh*t on it. Why would they make a \\"greatest hits\\"... to put B-sides and demos on it??? Those aren't their hits and that's what Lost Dogs and the fan club vinyls are for. When Soundgarden made \\"A-sides\\" how many of you were suprised to see radio singles on there. DUH!! They're called greatest hits for a reason and if you don't get that you should be out at Oppotunity Village handing out free Avril Lavigne t-shirts. Also considering the fact that PJ releases very few radio hits and makes close to no videos how much more un-\\"mainstream\\" do you want them to get? Every other post grunge band had twice as many videos and twice as many radio hits as Pearl Jam and faded out 5 almost 10 years ago! A true fan would understand that, but the ones who came along when they heard Staind remake \\"Black\\" (which sucks by the way) should just go back in the closet and listen to your pop music. Those who appreciate PJ's music will be happy with this collection of great songs. Finally we have 1 place where we can listen to both songs from the Singles sountrack with \\"I Got No ID\\" and \\"Man of the Hour\\", I couldn't be happier with this collection.
B0006399FS|5.0|This CD is not only great, I would place it in the U2 pantheon right alongside Achtung Baby and The Joshua Tree.  Their last release All That You Can't Leave Behind was good, but c'mon it was a tad overrated (Walk On Record of the Year!!!).  Not so for How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb which had me at hello...er make that Vertigo.  There isn't a weak song in the bunch.  Mark my words You Can't Make It On Your Own will go down as one of U2's greatest songs and there's easily 5-6 potential singles. Thanks U2 for another classic work.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If you think he made this stuff up, go to his website and check his sources. I did. It's documented LINE FOR LINE. Moore took all of my thoughts and put them into a movie. I was shocked and saddened that it wasn't just all in my head, but I still have to live with all of these facts.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I'll admit, if I didn't have to watch this movie I probably wouldn't have after 15 minutes of it. But, it was one of 3 movies on a cruise (to Mexico no doubt ;) and after you get over the first 15 minutes, it starts to come together and is pretty funny. It's not the funniest movie ever, but much better than what I expected and it'll have you saying \\"Gosh, Fine & idiot\\" for the next week :D <br /> <br />BTW, it apparently was a censored version I saw. Looked at the most memorable quotes and there was no wedding in the one I saw a couple of times. I'll be awaiting for it's release to see the rest.  <br /> <br />Will help teach you how to talk to babes all day in the chat room ;) <br /> <br />\\"Peace Out\\"
B00005JMAH|4.0|I am an avid Harry Potter fan and I have read all the books at least four times each.  I think that the &quot;Prisoner&quot; movie was done much better than the first two.  To start, it shows how the magic world is changing for Harry and how it will continue to change as the story unfolds throughout the future novels.  It's important to point out that the new director has been known in the past to put a dark spin on his interpretations in movies.  But I thought that this dark point of view is what is needed at this point in order to show that Harry and co. are no longer children and are entering into more dangerous territory.  Although the director did edit some parts of the book that I would have like to see, I think the movie overall does a great job in showcasing the future of the series.  I think the actors are really starting to come into their own and showing more depth in their interpretations of the characters.  I love to see how comfortable they are with each other in this film and to see how they are growing with these characters.  Overall, I think this movie is great and I can't wait to see &quot;Goblet&quot;.  Although I do agree that &quot;Goblet&quot; should be longer or made into a two part movie because to edit book four too much will ruin the movie and movie goers that don't read the books will be completely lost then.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Mary Poppins may be =the= stand-out live-action movie that Disney has ever produced. Or will ever produce.<br /><br />All the songs are very memorable. Who out there does not find themselves humming or even singing along with the likes of \\"Chim-Chim-Cheree\\" or \\"Spoonful of Sugar\\"?<br /><br />Julie Andrews will always be remembered for her role as Mary Poppins, and Dick Van Dyke absolutely shines as Bert the Chimney Sweep. Van Dyke also plays the senior officer of the bank - and has his very best scene where he realizes that the punchline - \\"A wooden leg named Smith\\" - is funny. Andrews won an Academy Award for Mary Poppins, and the movie also won Best Visual Effects, and Best Music Score, as well as Best Song (\\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\").<br /><br />The scene where \\"I love to laugh\\" is particularly poignant. Ed Wynn died not long after the release of Mary Poppins, and shows some of his best comedy style in this scene. Very laughable.<br /><br />The story is top-notch and has a wonderful moral without being too \\"preachy\\". It was a very good adaptation from the original novel, and it's a shame Disney never did any of P L Traver's own sequels to Mary Poppins.<br /><br />The animated bits are a little flat by today's standards, but they add a wonderful whimsey to a stellar production. Highly recommended to any family with children. A must-buy for Disney fans.<br /><br />This is the far better, two-disc, 40th anniversary edition that not only restores everything to digital quality, but adds a second disc of deleted scenes (and a song!), commentary, and many other cool new features. Look for the new 40th anniversary DVD edition - it's worth waiting for!<br /><br />It's just supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran is an awesome band, i love 80's synth-pop and this group is by far may favorite. This cd is a must have for any fan or newbie to duran duran's music. i highly recommend listening to 'the reflex' which is one of my fave songs! :)
B0006399FS|4.0|For u2's next project they should get long time friend and fan Rick Rubin to produce their album.  He is an innovative producer who's done work with everyone from the Chilli Peppers to the Beastie Boys.   <br /> <br />Basically, he takes things from jams at the studio and turns them into gems.  That's what u2 need, they are near perfection when they are just loose and don't care what people think about their music.  Rick Rubin would bring a fresh direction to the band, because my only problem with this album is that it's too constructed to please people. That's what ercks me. <br /> <br />\\"Vertigo\\" is awesome but it's a fun, in your-face hit designed to make people think the whole album is like this.  Why wouldn't people think that with Bono going on about this album being \\"their first rock n' roll\\" album an being a \\"monster.\\" <br /> <br />I can't call them any of these things, it is actually a pop rock album with a lot of mid-tempo stuff.  If I look at it as a pop rock album, it is another incredible piece of work from a band that still definetly has it.  If you look at it from what I was expecting, I'm a little dissapointing.  Still, the overall work is good and another solid release from U2.  Next time get that Def Jam guy though, fellas.
0316666343|4.0|This is a book about a young girl who was raped and killed.  She tells the story from up in her heaven.  It is interesting and does a good job of showing the emotions her family and friends continue to go through after her death.  I'm not a big nonfiction person, but this book was interesting.
B00030590I|4.0|\\"Hero\\" is an eye-popping,jaw-dropping visual feast of martial arts, it has nothing to do with Chinese politics or Communist propaganda, period!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|First the disclaimer, then the rave.  I am more inclined to the Village Vanguard than Broadway. Over the years I have been dragged to a number of revered musicals and found them musically uninteresting.  My daughter, a theater arts kid, was part of the cult of Wicked and talked me into buying a ticket.  I was upset that the performance conflicted with a key NBA playoff game, and fully expected to leave at intermission.  Fat chance.  Idina Menzel captured me in the first ten minutes.  She is a great singer by any standard.    The show is surprisingly relevant and profound--themes of totalitarian manipulation, the lure of power and popular adulation, the importance and limitations of friendship. Quite a production overall with lots of clever plot twists.  But at its core this is about the coming together of material and artist at the very highest level.  The album very well captures the performances though it cannot set them in context.
0762434279|3.0|This is one of those books that when you're finished reading, you'll say to yourself \\"this is mostly common sense\\" but it is still worth reading since it helps to reinforces what we already know. Even with the other negative reviews, the book does show you some of the basics of building a foundation for gaining wealth. There are many concepts in the book but I think the main takeaway of the book is the simple saying \\"don't try to keep up with the Jones'\\". Too many people get caught up trying to impress friends and family rather than focusing on their own personal situation. There are other tips but it is a quick read and is still worth reading.
B00068IOWC|5.0|I m thrilled with this new relase. U2 proves once again rock and roll is far from dead.U2 has returned to their roots with a <br />modern sound.A true triumph as only u2 can deliver.
B000001IQH|5.0|After Offspring's \\"Smash\\" got me into music in the 7th grade, and even before I really discovered Bad Religion, I bought this cd on tape after hearing \\"Time Bomb.\\"  I had no idea what it would sound like or if I would hate it or love it.  Fortunately, it become the latter.  This cd is amazing.  Tracks 1-19 are fantastic.  Throw out the \\"sell-out\\" discussions...if you really want to address that issue look at their next 2 records released after this (especially their 2nd self-titled record, which I even dislike for how incredibly inaccessible and \\"punk\\" it is).  Oddly enough, I respect Rancid more for releasing that album which I despise so much for making music that they love but the general public could not.  Anyway, that's for another discussion.  The bottom line is, this cd has become very influential for many new pop-punk bands (whether or not that is a good thing).  But you can't blame Rancid for that.  Cd's that become so influential simply comes down to the fact that they are very very GOOD.  If something is good, it IS going to be copied.  The only negative about Rancid, in my opinion (and many people are going to hate me for saying this) is Tim's voice.  I can't help but wonder how much better this cd and every one of their cd's could be if they had a new singer or if Lars sung most songs.  Don't get me wrong, Tim's voice is well-placed on many tracks and actually sounds very good at times (ex. Maxwell Murder) but he should simply not sing slow, melodic songs because it doesn't work.  His dyslexia becomes very apparent and it's almost embarrassing to hear him slur his words the way he does on those slow tracks. (However, that occurs more often on others cds; there really aren't any slow songs on this cd where it becomes noticeable).  I know that's very \\"punk rock\\" for Rancid to not care about that, but hey, why not make the music better by letting Tim continue to write great songs and play amazing guitar and leave the singing to someone else?  But that's another reason this cd is so fantastic...Tim's voice doesn't even affect its greatness.  Anybody can enjoy this cd.  Get it.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I got this album from one of my friends recently as a gift, and I have to say, I am not unimpressed. I instantly fell in love with every song and now it's on almost every single second of the day! Once you get past the whole lesbian image, you realize that these are great songs with great lyrics! My favorite song on this disc would have to be Stars. I love the instrumentals!
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is more than I could ask for for Simple Plan's second album. Songs like \\"shut up\\" and \\"me against the world\\" get me up every morning and rocking out in my room. These songs are even better than those in the first album! I cannot wait to hear what they have in store for us for another album
B0006399FS|5.0|Soulful, joyous, jammin and WOW! These are thoughts that come to mind when I spin this CD.  For those that do not like this, you do not get U2.  Their music is today and always has been about feeling and human emotion. This is why they are a universally loved band. They get it and can share it better than almost anyone else.  Sad for those that don't get it as at the root they are not about perfection or progression or style. U2 is all about the human condition of love, anger, passion, desire, pain, yearning and all of the feelings we as humans go through every day. This is why they continue to thrill:   Very few other bands can pull this type of depth off. U2 is and will always be one of the most awesome musical experiences you can have. This is great stuff, don't  miss it!
B00000K2UX|4.0|This is a pretty decent album. Personally, I think it has <br />too much pop music. But there are a handful of good tunes <br />on here. Dangerzone is one of the best soundtrack songs <br />IMO.... It's good music to work out to it gets the blood <br />pumping for sure. Another good track \\"You've Lost That  <br />Lovin' Feeling\\" and of course we have \\"Great Balls of  <br />Fire\\" but my favorite is the instrumental! Sure it's  <br />alittle repetitive,but I appericate the good music. The  <br />rest of the album is pretty hit or miss... You have  <br />\\"Mighty Wings\\" by Cheaptrick that is pretty good... Then  <br />you have overrated songs like \\"Take my Breath away\\" just  <br />totally lame in my book. I'd say it's a classic as far  <br />as soundtracks go... Just stay away from the poppy tunes  <br />because they stink.
B0006399FS|5.0|They are a pop rock band now, Bono is obsessed with being in the mainstream and being the biggest band in the world.  You have to have that pop appeal to get airplay on radio, and time on MTV and VH1.  Thus, ladies and gentlemen, we get \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\"   <br /> <br />You can't compare this album to \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Zooropa,\\" those were different times and they won't happen again.  I think the world has seen it's last of the experimental u2.  This is basically a rock album with a large pop influence on it, and you know what? It works.  A lot of u2 fans will be dissapointed that u2 have stayed in this direction after ATYCLB, but the last album was so huge.  Did you really think they would changed it up that much? Make a hard rock album that Bono was rambling on about?  <br /> <br />Put it like this, have you heard a better Rock-Pop album? I haven't.  It is basically pop perfection.  Every song sounds like it's meant for the radio, and could be played on it.  Some u2 fans, like my brother, hate that.  But I have no problem with it.  Yes, \\"Sometimes..\\" is a pop ballad but it is so incredible.  \\"Original of the Species\\" is a sappy ballad but it's quite brilliant and sounds like the Beatles had a re-union. <br /> <br />Overall, I rate this album 4.5/5.  I don't care what direction u2 goes in, I'm always happy with the final product.
B000667GFK|5.0|Even though I must admit I am a huge Luis Miguel fan, I must also confess that not all of his CD's have such a powerfull impact on me as his last piece of work, \\"Mxico en la piel\\". With supreme arrangements, Luis Miguel manages to revive jewls from the past in a sofisticated maner, deffinately, a must have CD, not only for heart felt Luis Miguel fans, but for anyone who appreciates quality music.
6304698690|4.0|This was a very enjoyable movie that appeals to both adults and children.  Now that my daughter is older I have had a hard time finding movies that appeal to me and my preteen. We are both tired of preteen movies that depict girls acting boy crazy or filled with off color jokes about bodily fluids and so on.  We enjoy the classic Disney movies but the newer movies tend to have too much singing and/or too little plot.  Lilo and Stitch comes to mind.<br /><br />We both liked the way that Mary and Collin grew from sour self absorbed children into caring and giving individuals. Each child confronted their own demons in a honest and uplifting way.  In addition, the visual aspects of the movie, especially the garden scenes were beautiful.<br /><br />It is one of our favorite movies and will enjoy it for many years to come.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This live performance is pure evolution for Metallica: From the best metal band in the 80's to the best metal band of all time. Many bands have tried and failed to incorporate a classical symphony into hard rock or heavy metal, and have failed everytime. Metallica have however managed to bring together a signature heavy metal performance with the San Fransisco Philharmonic.  <br />All the songs sound even better than on their CD releases ... a great live album to buy. I'd rate it 6/5 if possible!! :-)
B000000H4V|5.0|If you are only into sep's old stuff like arise, beneath the remains etc. this may not be your cup of tea. It is still a great aalbum though. They went from their pure thrash riffs and drumming to a more experimental tribal kind of sound, which by all means is still great, but quite different.  <br /> <br />Fans of soulfly will enjoy this more than fans of slayer. There is still the thrashy sound, but it is slower, you don't really feel the intensity of igor pounding away now, and kisser's solo's and riffs aren't as impressive, although the new sound is still good. The tribal drumming is superb, gives a really good vibe to the album, as with more use of acoustic. The lyrics are also a lot more meaningful, involving politics, unlike previous albums featuring death metal lyrics, and max's style lacks the distortion sound, although he can still roar like their is no tomorrow. <br /> <br />This is an amazing album, but Sepultura have done better (the better albums are some of the best albums of all time though) and the new direction is good. This is a lot better than soulfly's stuff, don't think just because both are tribal and contain max mean they will sound exactly the same.
B000002KCI|5.0|I first discovered an affinity for the music of Neil when I was in high school, on a steady diet of early-90s \\"grunge\\" rock.  After watching Neil perform with Pearl Jam at the MTV video music awards back in the early 90s (yes, I watched MTV at one point, and in my defense it used to actually contain *videos* instead of stupid reality shows-- what a concept) I declared myself a fan and have been listening to him off and on ever since.  I bought this disc when I was living in North California in the late 90s, on a whim when I saw it used.  I was aware of the good press but I wasn't impressed with it and basically shelved it for awhile.<br /><br />Then I came back to it a year or two later and it was like a revelation-- but a quiet revelation.  These songs have a way of burying themselves in your consciousness over time as they become more familiar.  It's the opposite of the \\"flash in the pan\\" effect-- instead of listening to the album on a daily basis for a month and then becoming so sick of it that I hardly touch it for a year, I'll listen now and then, always love it, and then put it away for when the mood hits me again.<br /><br />My favorite track here is \\"Pardon my Heart,\\" the slow ballad, which is unusual.  It is a rare ballad that will draw me to an album.  But in its slow-paced simplicity, this song may just be the only ballad I will ever need.  It's regretful but not bitter, and ironically places the blame on the songwriter himself for displaying his feelings to the songs' target.  I've imagined playing this for an ex or two, if I could get their attention for the three minutes it would take.  All the rest is good too, especially \\"Don't Cry No Tears\\" and \\"Lookin' for a Love,\\" which are thematically similar to \\"Pardon.\\"<br /><br />So basically, a slow-ish album with a lot of love-song-type material, some louder bits, some great guitar playing, a lot fo honest emotion.  Well worth your time and a great place to start with Neil.  Funny how it tends to be under-recognized these days.<br /><br />-Hunder-recognized these days. <br /> <br />-H
B0006399FS|1.0|Write boring lyrics.  <br />Compose tedious tunes. <br />Sing songs without any passion, feeling or zest.  <br /> <br />Hey Bono, ya need a good subject to write your next great song? How about the story of a fan who absolutely loved your band's music for years and then one day realized he's being taken for granted and decides to tune off?
B000004286|5.0|I got this soundtrack a few years ago, and the new has still not worn off, this soundtrack will haunt you with it's majesty, and bring tears to your eyes when you hear the delicate love theme.
B000063DFQ|4.0|This is a fun album to listen to -- even after twenty years. The only reason it misses the five star mark is \\"Quest for Fire.\\" This song mars what would otherwise be a perfect album. \\"In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth, when the land was swamp and caves were home...\\" Nah, cavemen and dinosaurs just don't cut it. But beyond that, every other song is great.<br /><br />Released the year after \\"Number of the Beast,\\" there were doubts that the band could follow up the massive success of that album. If anything, this album proved to be even more successful than its predecessor, with the hits \\"The Flight of Icarus\\" and \\"The Trooper.\\"  This album made Iron Maiden a household name during 1983 and 1984. They also embarked on their biggest tour yet, the extremely successful 1983/1984 World Piece Tour. This also gave Bruce Dickinson a chance to contribute to the songwriting process.<br /><br />Sadly, they lost ace drummer Clive Burr (a personal favorite of mine) over creative differences, but they gained the more versitile and fun loving Nicko McBrain, who has stuck with the band to the present day.<br /><br />The album also showed Eddie's most recent incarnation -- a lobotomy patient confined to a mental asylum after hanging out with the devil during the Rapture. Derek Riggs's artwork kept getting better and better with every album.<br /><br />With this album you get a band nearing their creative peak. With the exception of \\"Quest for Fire,\\" you won't be disappointed.
B0000B3B95|1.0|The Hulk starts out promising with the story of an obsessed scientist (Nick Nolte) trying to find out a way to regenerate cells.  Then, the scientist has a child (Eric Bana), there is an explosion, and after very very few transistions we find that Dr. Bruce Banner is working on how to regenerate cells after exposure to gamma rays.  What would you know it, Banner is exposed to the gamma rays and lives, but they cause him to become the Hulk.  This is where the potential of the story dries up and crusts. <br /> <br />The rest of the movie focuses on a strange father/son relationship between Nolte and Bana.  Neither of the two stars shines at the respective roles and the plot is too bizarre to really follow.  Eventually, Nolte gets absorbing powers (it isn't really explained why) and he and Bana fight to the death near the film's end. <br /> <br />I have no idea why the writer of this movie decided to make it a father/son conflict.  If you ever read about the origin of Hulk in the comic, you would know that Bruce Banner's father had no role in any of the comics (as far as I know).  Nolte's characters is ill concieved and out of place.  I mean, he has a freaking attack poodle! <br /> <br />It was also disappointing that the Hulk was never really a \\"hero\\" in this movie.  The only heroic thing that he did was save Jennifer Connelly's character (from the attack poodle) once.  Throughout the rest of the movie, he is just a nuisance that the military is trying to control.  He freaking bounces through the desert for way too many scenes in the movie. <br /> <br />I don't really know a lot about cinemotography, but I can say that Ang Lee's directing was annoying.  The moving box shots very really stupid and made the movie laughable. <br /> <br />In short, the Hulk is bad and hard to stay awake on.  The story is just confusing and meandering.  Neither Nolte nor Bana act well.  Jennifer Connelly is ok but is basically just eye candy; her character is developed properly, like the way that most of the characters aren't developed properly.  Just avoid \\"The Hulk.\\"  See \\"Spiderman 2\\" instead.  It is 500x better.
0345451325|4.0|this is the kind of book that all halo people love because it fills in the blanks that the games don't cover. It talks about the master cheif before halo and what he is (he's not your average human. <br />However, I would suggest you get the set of all three halo books, as i am soon to do.
B00065JTBA|2.0|Bon Jovi understood Arena Apeal real early in the game&were able to maintain that. this Box set has alot of reject Material that you can see why never made the Offical releases.they pretty much have been coasting after there \\"New jersey\\" album. over the top ballads&still trying to re-capture that Groove&Hook for \\"Living on a Prayer\\". truth is they are must remembered for doing the MTV Unlugged for \\"wanted Dead or alive\\".One of the Few Hair Bands that Escaped the 80's how&Why is still a Mystery??
B0006399FS|1.0|My opinion-only my opinion, mind you- is that this is the worst U2 album so far.  U2 is (was?) of the greatest rock bands of all time- great, but spotty at times.  War, Unforgettable Fire, Achtung Baby- great.  Pop, Zooropa, Under a Blood Red Sky, Joshua Tree- very good.  All That You Can Leave Behind-overrated (Beautiful Day is one of their best songs; Elevation one of their worst).  The rest- OK/good (except HTDAAB). 'The Million Dollar Hotel' soundtrack is the best U2 album since Pop (and it it's only partially U2!). <br />Anyway, concerning the new album- what happened to the songwriting?  What happened to the mix of pop and musical experimentation that made them great?  I read in some mass market magazine (US, People, or Entertainment Weekly, I don't remember) that Bono/Edge presented the 1st round of songs to Clayton/Mullen Jr., who then rejected them because they 'weren't enough hits'.  Well, I'd be interested in hearing them because it sounds like the second set (the new album) were 'tunes' thrown together- rushed, lyrically and musically.  The music, let's face it, is cliche; Bono sounds tired/uninspired; the lyrics are nothing. <br />POP gets bashed (even by U2)- too 'electronic/disco' (although it really is a great GUITAR record), the 'critics' didn't like it (who cares?); it 'didn't do well' (9 million sold?).  Read:  the average 'American' rock fan (of Joshua Tree, in 1987, who buys 2 albums a year at most) /Rolling Stone didn't like it.  I think POP has more good songs than HTDAAB and ATYCLB combined! <br />I guess time will tell, overall, but I don't think any song from BOMB will be considered a classic. <br /> <br />For rock/pop/alternative music 2004, try Keane 'Hopes and Fears', Interpol 'Antics' or (for rock fans) Jet 'Get Born'.  WAY more inspiring. <br /> <br />NB
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot, in my opinion, are one of the greatest rock bands on the planet today and it's not because of their masks or their unique number of people, it is because they provide quality music with brutality, beauty, groove, and grind. Some people call that watered down crap, I call it beautiful and it started here, in which they provide some of their best material. Great album.
078322947X|4.0|The first time I saw \\"Sorcerer\\" I made an unfavorable comparison of it to the original film version, \\"The Wages of Fear\\".  On further viewing I now find this comparison unfair because \\"Sorcerer\\" stands up as a work unto itself.  Blotting out all recall of \\"The Wages of Fear\\" I found myself caught up in this edge-of-your-seat tale of desperate men transporting nitro in squalid Latin America to put out a refinery fire.  Director William Friedkin crisply paces his story for maximum impact.  The editing and cinematography also enhance the story.  Roy Scheider and the international actors here acquit themselves well.  What was most striking to me was the production design of John Box.  Awards are not given out for designing squalor.  The jungle locales with all their pitfalls is also a major character here.  \\"Sorcerer\\" is definitely a film to be discovered or in some cases rediscovered.
B000669GAI|2.0|I only liked a Little of Pearl Jam back when they were Hot in the early 90's as part of the Seattle scene&Sound. Eddie Veddar was the focal Point of the Band. in truth there wasn't alot of edge to there Music,but they Hit with some songs that made you think a Little Bit. now Pearl Jam's true Legacy is the OffSpring of :Hootie&the BlowFish,Stone Temple Pilots,Creed&Knickleback all Acts sound like Pearl Jam Knockoffs. that to me is there Impact. they pretty much peaked out after 1994.
B0006399FS|2.0|I can't beleive this album is such a dissapointment. <br /> <br />I never thought U2 would sink so low, how can they settle for this crap. <br /> <br />\\"Vertigo\\" is alright and  <br />\\"Sometimes You can make it on your own\\" is a pretty good tune - \\"All because of you\\" is pretty good, but the rest, is this really the U2 album that everyones been waiting so long for? <br /> <br />Overall the whole album has the same tone of the song \\"Vertigo\\" mostly and what makes this album even more outragous is that it was named by the band as \\"The best U2 album ever\\" well it is'nt. <br /> <br />I was actually expecting on this record  <br />(as was said by many before it came out)that it sounds like the old U2 updated. So I was expecting a louder edgier guitar sound to it with heaps of \\"mega\\" tracks, and some straight forward sounding songs as well....................I just am really dissapointed........you should be to.......enough said.
B0000634EV|5.0|This album,and Down as a whole rock, I love both albums, (this one and NOLA), and I think that they really provide a breath of fresh air to metal music. This isn't as heavy or as crazy as Pantera as it is more of a laidback vibe, but it is great. This has some of the best vocals that Anselmo has ever done and some incredible beats to go with it. Songs like Ghosts of the Mississippi, Stained Glass Cross, and Where I'm Going, affect you in different ways, all good, providing for an eclectic grab bag of musical sounds. I really hope that anselmo brings back down soon. This is some awesome music. Definitely recommended.
B0006399FS|1.0|If you think the joshua tree was their best record, if you thought it was cool when the edge started dressing like a boyband has-been, if you were one of the people that hailed \\"all you can't leave behind\\" as a \\"return to the old sound,\\" then you'll probably love this bad record. The truth is, joshua tree sucked, the edge is a loser who just wanted to sell records to pay for a new roof for his mansion, and all you can't leave behind was recycled american pop, thrown in our faces to get at our wallets. \\"Boy\\" through \\"war\\" were Irish teenage frustration albums, and there is something great about them (except for maybe \\"october\\"). \\"Unforgettable\\" through \\"Joshua\\" were silly experimentation with american music. \\"Achtung\\" was better and it was recorded in germany and they got Eno on the team. \\"Zooropa\\" had ups and downs, but the direction they were going in was clear. They got Flood for the production on \\"Pop\\" and it turned out to be an intelligent, sarcastic, forward-thinking record. Seriously, look at who produced each record, and you'll realize where the sounds come from. I'd give credit to Flood for that one. I also heard that they had a big white board of bits of lyric Bono was not allowed to put into the songs, because they would be too stupid and cliche. \\"how to dismantle\\" is worse than \\"all you can't leave.\\" You don't even get something catchy, like \\"beautiful day.\\" I've heard the record through a few times, and i can't think of one bass line, one bit of lyric, one melody. At least on \\"all you can't leave\\" i could remember stupid lines like \\"i'm like a mole digging in a hole, now, excavation\\" or \\"you've got to get yourself together.\\" This record had nothing. they are done. I was hoping they would at least go for silly electronic gimics, anything to keep my attention. Basically, it's a straight rock record, stripped down to guitar, bass, drums, and vocal, but without any of the energy of the early days. They are old and tired, and apparently don't even care anymore. Starting at a high point with \\"boy\\" and ending at an even higher point with \\"pop\\" would have been a sweet career. Now i'm just wondering how many bad records they're going to do until they finally stop. I thought it was interesting when one reviewer praised the album as \\"a return to form.\\" Please, explain to me how being unoriginal is a good thing. One thing i always loved about U2 was the experimentation with new sounds they were so open to and interested in. They were always pushing in some direction, at least up until \\"the sweetest thing\\" single. It's been downhill since. Another reviewer insisted that this WAS a new direction and that we shouldn't expect \\"achtung\\" or \\"war\\" etc. Well this reviewer didn't, and i'm still dissapointed. I wanted something fresh and new, but i got old and tired. And please, after flood, steve lillywhite sounds like crap (even though those DMB records were great [that was sarcasm, DMB sucks]). And has anybody heard Lanois' solo album? it's terrible. Overall, this is a bunch of has-beens. And it's loved by a bunch of old dudes that though The joshua tree was the best thing ever. Even worse, those wierd fans that love rattle and hum...what's the deal with that?
B0006399FS|2.0|I use to really dig U2 back in the day,but somewhere in the early 90's U2 got into this Over the top type of Music Making which distance themselves from the Good Songwriting they use to present back in the 80's. they have become so contrived&now they are like a Act that just shows up in Name only.this album is Average at best. not a single knock-Out cut.
B00067BBQE|5.0|Packaged in a single CD box, this DVD + CD has as follows:    The DVD has three main sections:    Concert, Music Videos, and Behind the Scenes    The Concert, filmed live in Paris, has the following songs:    Haunted, Going Under, Taking Over Me, Everybody's Fool, Thoughtless (Korn cover), My Last Breath, Farther Away, Breathe No More, My Immortal, Bring Me to Life, Tourniquet, Imaginary, and Whisper.    The music videos are:    My Immortal, Everybody's Fool, Bring Me To Life, and Going Under    Behind the Scenes has the following sections:    Life on the Road ..., Showtime, Bloopers, and Evanescence Unleashed.    The CD has the same tracks as the Concert DVD with the addition of the studio version of Missing.  Note that the liner notes and the CD text are not correct.  Missing is not the 8th track, but is actually the 14th track.  So, tracks 8 through 14 are all mislabeled.    The production values of the live concert video are excellent with multiple camera angles, and tastefully done digital effects.  The surround sound is quite good.  Most importantly, this is the best live work I have ever seen from Evanescence, and most importantly Amy Lee.  Clearly, the entire band gave their absolute best effort for this DVD, and it shows.      It's great having the four previously released videos collected together in high resolution video and with good quality sound.      I like the idea of the CD which allows for playing of the music from the concert DVD on any standard CD player.  A studio version of Missing makes its domestic debut here (it previously appeared on imported `singles').  It's a fine song which was originally intended for Fallen but was cut, along with Farther Away, and the truly exceptional Breathe No More (the latter two are included in the live concert).    Behind the Scenes is a compilation of \\"home video\\" of the group.  It's very funny stuff.    There is at least one \\"Easter Egg\\". Run the cursor over the left thorn on the main menu, which will cause their logo to appear. Click on the logo and you will see their live performance of Bring Me to Life during the Billboard Music Awards.    This is a must buy for any fan of Evanescence, and any lover of great rock music.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is my current favorite.  I just can't get enough of Russell Crowe or this movie.  Love it's actors, style, music.  A must see.  A instant classic.  Superb battle scenes.  A ton of heart.  Can think of anything bad to say.  Although it may be a little violent for some.  But, that's a given considering the subject.  Russell Crowe's charactor is a amazingly brave man that you what to see win.  Joaquin Phoenix gives an exrodinary acting job. As the troubled spoiled son who will do anything to have what he wants.  Many amazing supporting actors.  A great exit role for Richard Harris.  A Great Film!
B00009V7P8|5.0|I felt compelled to write this review after being lucky enough to see Damien Rice live a little while ago and coming away from the experience with a whole new perspective on what real, emotive music should be. I picked up O through hearsay and immediately just got completely drawn into it. It is superb. There are not many, if any, other singer/songwriters around that have the effect of this man. His voice is capable of so much, and the use of female singers on this cd to support him vocally only acts to enhance the entrancing nature of his voice. It is impossible to pick a favourite track on this album, there simply is not a bad one. Each track is individual and stands apart from the others. Things that would sound pretentious on other cds, like the opera singer on eskimo, seem to fit perfectly with the overall effect of the album. It bristles with raw emotion, which is at times delicate and understated, and at others so overt it is heartbreaking. This cd is something really special. Damien Rice is something really special. He is completely captivating, and once you listen to this cd, you will realise why he is light years ahead of other bland and soppy solo artists. Having shared this around with a few of my friends, they have all come back, no jokes, with exactly the same reaction: \\"this man is god,\\" and i cannot possibly conceive a better description of his talent and all-encapsulating emotion. The man will give you goosebumps - be converted to the gospel of Damien Rice!!!
B00000I07P|1.0|Here it is - Slippery When Wet . I believe Bon Jovis 3rd album .<br />This album is a turning point if you follow heavy metal . Its the watershed album that turned heavy metal from an up and comming genre into a laughing stock . This band doesnt get the flack it deserves . This is the 1910 Fruitgum Company with flangers and fuzzboxes. Its candy a$$ crap aimed at 13 year old girls. Its part of the reason music is in the sad state it finds itself today. This is what Nirvana( the most over rated band<br />in history )and a host of grunge bands revolted against ... and successfully so. Why ? Because this music is so bad that anything would make it look good. You can directly thank Bon Jovi and crue for the pussification of heavy metal.
B00005YW4H|1.0|This is the worst cd I have ever listened to in my whole life. I listened to it after she won mutliple grammy's and was amazed that this cd even won one.  She does not write her own lyrics for her songs nor her music. This cd is a complete waste of time and I feel sorry for al souls who beleive this is a good cd. Her voice is absolutely horrendous and the melody in all the songs is pretty much the same, along with her continuous monotone voice. I wasted part of my life by listening to this cd. I feel as though I am a stupider person having listened to her.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I've read some of the other reviews.  And, as I figured this is a polarized group of viewers.  I don't hold anything against someone for not liking this movie.  But, I was one who just loved it.  It's a matter of personality I guess.  I would not consider this an \\"art film\\" exactly.  Someone mentioned Remains of the Day.  And, yes I would agree that this might be seen as similar.  But, to me the point was a little different.  That story was a little more tragic in a way.  I was left with a sad feeling with Remains of the Day.  In Lost in Translation, I felt as if I knew these two characters and it was just beautiful.  It must just be something you would have to have experienced on some level.  Not to say you would have to have been in the same situation.  But, to have felt this way at some point in your life.  The movie, to me, is about cherishing those tiny irretrievable moments in your life that haunt you forever.  Also, letting something wonderful be what it is, and not pushing for more.  The acting was the best.  And, Sophia has one of the deepest hearts in the world for pulling this seemingly simple idea off.  It's something I've never seen before.  And, doubt I'll ever see again.  A delicate wonderful film.
B00064AM6C|5.0|Ok, I know this is a lil unfair to review something before it comes out, but I see people do it on here all the time so... I signed up to this amazon.com review thing just to tell you to buy this!  I, along with the rest of my band Anti Talent, know it will be good!  Every White Stripes CD is amazing, and live in concert they are mouth wateringly delicious!  Buy this DVD, and then go see them live; you won't regret it!  We're also hoping to go see a theater showing of this movie, so that should be killer!  Ok, well there's my two cents... oh and if you're bored and wanna check out some more Detroit area punk rock 'n' roll, check out our band Anti Talent at antitalent.com  There's a lame plug, but as my grandpa always says, \\"You gotta do somethin'.\\"  But more importantly, long live the White Stripes! <br /> <br />Tony Lugosi <br />[...]
B000002AZ8|5.0|this is a must, absolutely, this is the best pearl jam cd,ever. It is different from \\"ten\\" and \\"vs\\",of course is darker than their previous CDs and at the beggining sounds kind of strange but it is because their songs are more crafted,they have different moods, and it is strange listen to \\"tremor christ\\"and \\"inmortality\\",both of them being angry and melancholic,but this cd have these songs which are among the finest,\\"corduroy\\", \\"spin the black circle\\",and of course \\"nothingman\\" and \\"betterman\\",which should be the most sad love song that i've listened(although in fact it is dedicated to the \\"[...] that married my mom\\"as eddie said in some concert).Here pearl jam is at their best.\\"Ten\\" is the most selled, \\"Vs\\"is the visceral one and \\"vitalogy\\" is the best,no doubt about it
B000002KGT|5.0|I'll reiterate what every music critic has mentioned: the sound on this recording is stellar, the vocal harmonies between the three leads are extraordinary, the songwriting is outstanding, etc.  What makes me spin this CD more often than most is the fact that the lyrics are also incredibly personal and touch on subject matter that is universal and emotionally resonant.  There are the obvious hits which include \\"Dreams,\\" \\"Don't Stop,\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way.\\"  Then there are other songs here that reach epic standards like \\"The Chain\\" and \\"Gold Dust Woman.\\"  To top it all off there are some fun tracks like \\"Second Hand News\\" and \\"I Don't Want To Know.\\"  This album has achieved iconic status representing some of the finest music ever to come out of the seventies.  Be that as it is, the music still sounds fresh and vibrant today as when it was first released.  Front to back, this is an essential album for any collection.  Highly recommended.
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers is definately one of the Rolling Stones best albums.  The Stones play a more bluesy and country-ish sound, and it is not plagued by any filler.  The album opens up with Brown Sugar, which would go on to be one of the Rolling Stone's most popular singles.  'Sway', the next track, is very good, and has a catchy rhythm.  'Wild Horses' is a beautful country-like ballad that is easy to fall in love with.  The next song is \\"Can't You Hear Me Knockin'\\" which is very catchy, and has a great instrumental ending.  The worst song on the album is 'You Gotta Move\\" which is a cover.  Just because it is the worst song, doesn't mean that it is bad, however.  The next song is \\"Bitch\\" and is the most rocking tune on the album.  'I Got The Blues' is a very lovely song that I find singing all of the time.  One of the most cryptic Stones songs is \\"Sister Morphine.\\"  It might not be the best song on this album, but it is probably the one you will be thinking about the most after listening to it.  'Dead Flowers' is a country song, and one of the best on this album as well, in my opinion.  The album ends off with 'Moonlite Mile' which is a very beautiful song, and is a great way to end the album.  I think this album would be a good listen for anyone, whether they are already into the Rolling Stones or not.
B000687M48|3.0|I got this cd a bit before it was released and i was impressed! Although most of thier live show is their same old stuff, they play a few new awesome songs like farther away and breathe no more (which totally pwned!) They did lose ben moody, but in the process they got terry balsamo from cold!!! (if you've even heard of cold u silly mainsteamers) terry's a great guitar player and he's a great fit in evanescence. These 2 new songs are a good sign that he will deliver all the goods and more that moody had done in \\"Fallen\\". Overall their new band members and few new songs are a rock solid live show. Whether your a mainstream listener or know most bands from a-z (like me) this cd is worthy of at least a few spins on your cd player....
B0006399FS|4.0|I originally bought this CD just for \\"Vertigo\\" but after listening, the whole album was worth the money. There's only a few songs I found a little boring but the majority a really good. \\"Yahweh\\" is especially worth hearing
B00007E8V4|4.0|If you're yet to hear Sytem Of A down then start with System Of A Down or Toxicity first. This simply isn't on the same level, neither is it doing anything new. But then, its not supposed to be. Steal This Album!, as the title suggests, is reworked and remastered outtakes (I'm not sure if they're entirely from Toxicity or what), so the band hardly consider this to be some of their best work. Its still a great listen though, especially if you're a fan of System's semi-serious, heavy yet quirky sound.<br /><br />If this were a brand new album, I'd be a little concerned that they were getting a little redundant and repeating themselves. I'd worry that they were not progressing and growing as a band and had decided to just stick with a formula. But that isn't the case, so I think they're safe for now. Steal This Album is a fun album with some great songs, some of which I rate just as highly as anything from their first 2 albums. Its far from the bands best work, but like I said, its not meant to be.<br /><br />For those who don't know the band, they're pegieon-holed as nu-metal but unlike most bands in the genre, they have an original and diverse sound. Serj Tankian is still one of my favourite vocalists.<br /><br />BTW, for those not currently in the know, their new album Hypnotise has been delayed until March 2005. Hopefully it'll explore new directions and I have faith that it will.
B0002Y69NG|1.0|This is the most overrated trilogy in the whole movie history. The only Oscar deserved by The Matrix was for special effects. If you buy this package, you will encourage production of other movies of this level.
0312330529|5.0|I'm not a big reader so for me to finish a 900 plus page book in itself is an achievement and a mark of how great a story this one is. <br /> I first heard of Shantaram when I visited a friend who was reading it and raved about it. I picked it up a couple of times and each time I opened a page was hooked into the story enough to read a few pages. <br />Shantaram is a fantastic book...give it a go...you will be hooked from the opening paragraph. Yet it may not be as appealing to women as it would be for men.....as it's a bit of a macho boys own adventure <br />The author mentioned his habit of taking daily notes during the time his adventures happened....it is obvious...as the detail he goes into is amazing. <br />The book got me thinking about how some people always seem to choose or end up following a difficult path, and maybe this is part of these people's destiny....in order to help them grow and learn <br />For anyone wanting to hear an online interview with the author go to [...]
B000687M48|5.0|There's my review for this package in a nutshell. Fallen is NOT Evanescence's debut cd. It's their \\"major label debut\\". A live album now makes perfect sense to me, they don't have Moody around anymore, so you have to expect some changes. This is a little sweetener while we wait for the next studio release. And it is sweet. 'Nuff said. <br />P.S. Wanna know what's come before? Head to exodusevanescence.com

Why Bono try so hard to prove he can sing high ? why ? the outcome is horrible.  - Edge, Adam and Larry: Only Edge plays here. The other ones are filler. Any other musician can play better than this boring ryhthm section. Edge is not creative at all here. He uses the same guitars again and again.  - Production: the production is ridiculous, soft and false. Letting them down  - New album hype: makes believe this one \\"is so wonderful, great, the best U2 album\\" and blah blah blah.   - People from U2 team working here: why any review with 3 stars or less has an average 40% helpful, while any review with 5 stars is 80% helpful, no matter review quality ?  - HTDAAB isn't original: That's the reason why this album is also called All That You Can't Leave Behind II.  - HTDAAB marketing: shameful, terrible, awful.   - HTDAAB review: lame, recycled, pointless, cheap, stupid, commercial, fake, comfortable, safe, easy, accessible, eatable, fashionable, cynic.    but don't forget...    BEST U2 ALBUM EVER !!!! - BONO
B0006284JQ|3.0|People aren't going to like this because it's Brittany Spears, people are going to review it badly without every buying it.  She's not the greatest singer in the world, but like Madonna before her, she has slick producers producing some classic pop/dance songs.
0553269631|5.0|All of us have a variety of characters that we meet and encounter throughout our lives.  Some of them odd, some of them funny, some of them dull, and I venture to say we have bumped into, on more than one occasion, those whom we might deem as a \\"social outcast.\\"  Never before had I read a novel that attempted to put into words what it might be like to be one of these lonely outcasts.  Of course the characters in \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,\\" are not viewed in a way we would think of most outcasts.  They are viewed in the story with a sense of realism and awe that most novels can not generate.  These characters and their lives and thoughts will become more and more real as the novel unfolds.    The novel is told in brilliant, almost poetic third person.  Although I bet if down the road if someone were to ask you about this book, you would swear it was told in first person by each of the characters.  The novel is essentially about a year in time of five very different, very vivid characters.  The characters are all searching for something they can never seem to find.  All of them are as different as night and day, but have so many things in common.    The story switches from one character to another with each passing section.  We gain tremendous insight to their personal lives, oddities, and behavior in a writing style like no other.  If I had to choose who the main character would be, it would have to be Mr. Singer.  Mr. Singer is a mute.  He can understand words that are spoken to him by the movements of others lips.  The story opens beautifully, describing his friendship with another mute friend, Antropulous.  The story describes the poignant feelings Mr. Singer has toward his friend.  Soon into the story, Mr. Singer's friend is put a mental institution by his own brother.  This turn of events wounds and scars the heart of Mr. Singer.  Not soon after, Mr. Singer begins going to a caf, which is owned by another one of the stories characters, Biff.  Biff is very strange, and has become even stranger since the death of his wife.  He has one redeeming quality, in that he takes good care of the customers who some into his caf.  One of these customers is Jake.  Jake is another outcast.  He is an alcoholic, with a mean streak in him.  He rants and raves about how unequal the country is.  Another character we encounter in the caf is Mick.  Mick might be the most fascinating character in the story. She is kind of a tomboy, who loves music, and exploring the streets at night.  The final main character is Mr. Compton, a black doctor, who has hatred in his heart for white men.    McCullers does a superb job of bringing these characters all together.  Mr. Singer finds a new place to stay after his best friend goes to the nut house.  That new place is Mick's house.  One by one, the main characters meet Mr. Singer and become magnetically drawn to them.  They tell him of their frustration, their worries, and how they feel about life.  Mr. Singer just smiles and listens because he can't speak.  Occasionally, he will write down something on a piece of paper if he has something important to say.    Mr. Singer can't figure out why these people are drawn to him.  The fascinating thing is that all the main characters know each other, yet none of them like anyone by Mr. Singer, who seems to be the thread holding all their lives together.  Mick loves him more than her own father, Mr. Compton feels he is the only white man with any worth, Biff just finds him interesting, and Jake considers him the only one who understands.  All along, Mr. Singer has loneliness in his own heart for his friend that has been sent away.  Every so often he gets a chance to visit him, but it is not the same.  These visits are some of the most breathtaking passages in the novel.    There is not time or room to explain all that happens in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.  I have just given some of the basics.  There is so much more that happens, and so much more that I could say.    I don't know if I have ever enjoyed reading a novel as much as this one.  The language was so alive, so fresh, so beautiful, and so heart wrenching.  This book might have the most interesting characters I have ever read about.  I can't get it out of my head.  It is hard to put into words the reasons that make this book a masterpiece.  One is that it evokes powerful emotions with you.  McCullers is an absolute master at pointing out little observances, oddities, and other things in life that we might just forget about, or not take the time to notice.  The book is filled with these precious little gems scattered throughout the masterful plot and style.      The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is also very entertaining.  Yet it goes past the mediocrity of mindless entertainment, and takes us on a deep, emotional, and unsentimental journey through the lives of people that you will come to know so well.  You will feel that if you met these characters in real life, you would know everything about them.  McCullers puts in the time, and the reader is heavily rewarded.   Even if the characters might not be extremely likable, but we care so much to find out what will happen next in their lives.    I loved this book.  The story and mood has continued to linger on in my mind, compared to other books that fade so quickly.  This story is more felt than read.  I love it even more the way McCullers ends this book.  The ending takes a turn no one could have expected, and makes the novel even more deep and thoughtful that it would have been otherwise.  Why can't every book be this good?  Why can't every book shake my soul to the core with such power as this one did?  These questions, like many others posed by this masterpiece, are left unanswered.    Grade: A
B00005JMAH|5.0|Few movie franchises can undergo a change of directors and end up with a sequel as successful as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Star Wars is the first to come to mind, but there are few others. Never-the-less, Director Alfonso Cuarn, who experianced art-hose fame with 2001's Y Tu Mam Tambin, brought a dark and exciting vision to the ever-changing world of Harry Potter. <br /> <br />Nearing his thirteenth birthday, Harry finds himself storming his way out of the dreadful home of The Dursleys after mistakingly blowing up his aunt. When he finally makes it back to his home at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he finds out that his life is once again in danger. The notorious murder Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison, a feat that has never before been sucessfully completed, and has only one thing on his mind: finding Harry and his friends. It will take the support of friends old and new for Harry to solve this mystery and discover the true identity of Black and understand his connection to Harry's parents. <br /> <br />Newcomers David Thewlis (The Island of Dr. Moreau, Divorcing Jack), provides the role of the kind yet mysterious Professor R.J. Lupin, and Gary Oldman (Bram Stoker's Dracula,The Fifth Element), bringing his trademark villinay to the role of the dark Sirius Black, both perform excellently and seem to fit perfectly in the world of Harry Potter. While once again the filmakers remain true to the original book by author J.K. Rawling, and yet still add a few suprises of their own. <br /> <br />The two-disc widescreen edition features exclusive never-before-seen footage, revealing interviews with the cast and filmakers, as well as a rare interview with J.K. Rawling herself, 3 on-screen games, self-guided tours of Honeydukes and Profesor Lupin's classroom, designing the special effects featurettes, theatrical traliers for all three Harry Potter movies, video game previews, and more!

B00013F38K|5.0|Ok, what you've got here is a beautiful package with three double-sided discs which hold the two-hour (two-part) series pilot, plus fifteen individual episodes -- the entire Kung Fu first season. My only complaint is that the top and bottom of the screen are cut out, to make it \\"wide screen\\". Crazy. It does make the product look slyer, but by taking away from the show. However, so little is lost, and you soon forget that anything is missing. This is such a classic series, who cares? Kung Fu on DVD! I would list the episodes, but below Corgweyn has done this nicely.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with the show, allow me to give you a brief but honest rundown: A \\"western\\", of sorts, Kung-Fu deals with a Shaelin Priest (Cain) who is outlawed after killing his old blind master Po, the Emperor's nephew. Being half Chinese, half American, he escapes to the \\"old west\\" of America, embarking on a series of adventures, dealing with racist cowboys, blood-thirsty bounty hunters, and Chinese assassins sent to kill or return him. (He is worth $10,000 alive, $5,000 dead.) This is a classic and unique series, dealing far more with humanity, Chinese philosophy and wisdom than fighting. Its occult value is hot, and its incredible acting and stories are memorable and striking. A show for those who like something different, where truth and gentleness can win out over lies and crudeness. He is one with nature. Yet he always maintains, \\"I am just a man.\\" <br />Highly recommended for all audiences!
1400032717|1.0|Since the book is about a 15-year-old, I thought it might make a great Christmas gift for a 15-year-old relative, so I bought the book and decided to read it first.  I'm glad I did.  This book reminds us how adults in the community can be so flippant with the use of profanity in front of children.  The story puts Christopher in contact with a number of adults who use profanity while speaking to him, and I found that to be an inappropriate message for me to give to a young relative.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Unlike some of the other people that have offered their opinions on this movie, I think this movie was not only far more interesting cinematically than the first two, I thought it was far more true to the book.  Let me explain.  It may have left out some of the details of the plot, although if you look carefully there are many little hints throughout the movie that allure to events from the book that probably only those who read them can catch, but the spirit of the book was much more like J K Rowling.  It was full of this playful sarcastic humor, rather than the fairly straightforward and everyday humor of the first two movies.  This truly brought out the feel of the wizarding world.  Also, the actors did a much better job this time around, and I thought the darker scenery of the movie is a good reflection on how much darker the books get further in the series... Just my take on it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't add any more praises for this series, except to say what a big shame the network could not appreciate such a high quality show that was well written and acted with very well written and performed characters.
B00004SCY9|4.0|UK dancepop duo Moloko are in fine form in \\"Things to Make And Do,\\" their third blend of acid jazz and trippy electronica. The talented Roisin Murphy and Mark Brydon create a charmingly erratic dance album that sounds like nothing else, yet never fails to draw you in.<br /><br />It opens with a peculiar piano solo, before kicking into the sexy sax-keyboard of \\"Pure Pleasure Seeker,\\" and the ominously trippy \\"Absent Minded Friends.\\" A darker note enters with songs like \\"Being Is Bewildering,\\" which is technically a more \\"normal\\" song, a slow and rather melancholy song based on acoustic guitar and organ. Same with the lower-key pop song \\"The Time is Now.\\"<br /><br />There are also some more experimental songs, such as the nonsensical funk of \\"Indigo\\" or the creepy psycho-vocals of \\"If You Have A Cross To Bear You May As Well Use It As A Crutch.\\" \\"Remain the Same\\" is perhaps the most experimental, with the vocal sampling and sound of the organ being overwhelmed and sunk by the electronic bleeps.<br /><br />In this release, Moloko downplays the outright weirdness in favor of a more subtle sound. Call it experimental ultraquirk acid-jazz-funk-house-trip-hop. That more or less describes it. It's not just a fun album, but a richly engaging one with some deceptively simple-sounding songwriting.<br /><br />Roisin (no, it doesn't rhyme with \\"raisin\\") Murphy has an excellent voice for this type of music -- it sounds clear and flexible, while being strong enough to rise over powerful music that could have overwhelmed her. And she brings depth to certain songs like \\"Mother,\\" where she lashes out at her mother in a restrained manner: \\"I know somehow somewhere I'll be bumping into you/you see I'm blameless/I had a mother who was shameless/no wonder my life collapsed!\\" Elsewhere the songwriting is just deliciously bizarre.<br /><br />Mark Brydon takes charge of the musical backdrop for Roisin's voice. And a fine job he does too, blending organic instrumentation like piano, acoustic guitar and rippling strings with some vocal sampling and deliciously wacked-out beats, sounding like anything from a DJ on acid to the funkier twin of Portishead.<br /><br />Erratic it may be, but \\"Things to Make And Do\\" is also fun, wild and extremely eclectic, switching styles the way most musicians do instruments. It may not be their best album, but it is a wonderfully engaging, trippy one.like piano, acoustic guitar and rippling strings with some vocal sampling and deliciously wacked-out beats, sounding like anything from a DJ on acid to the funkier twin of Portishead.  <br />  <br />Erratic it may be, but \\"Things to Make And Do\\" is also fun, wild and extremely eclectic, switching styles the way most musicians do instruments.

0767834739|5.0|I am an enormous Milla fan and I thought Resident Evil 2 was good. Although I do prefer the first film. The whole thing about accuracy compared to the actual video game is of little or no importance to me. I am more interested in the quality of the film judged on its own merit. If you like the game, action filled zombie movies or the divine Milla Jovovich, you should check out this DVD. But also take a look at part one, if you haven't already.
B00026W82U|4.0|riot on an empty street is a bit more peppy than it's predecessor (indeed ' i'd rather dance with you' is practicallly metallica  in comparison ) though there's till plenty of whispery, simon and garfunkely sensitivity to keep fans of the first album happy.<br /><br />Some reviewers have mentioned the desire for some of the dance edge seen on erland's dj kicks album, but to me that doesn't fit with the band (much as i like the dj kicks album) Also when it comes to do doing acoustic folk no one does it better than the kings of convenience.....
B00005JNDX|3.0|At the end of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" sweet, sexy, clumsy, confused Bridget had at last fulfilled her dreams.  <br /> <br />She found her ideal man in Mark Darcy. She stopped being a dreaded singleton. She became a TV journalist. She finally accepted herself as she was - the 20 extra pounds, the cigarettes, the alcohol units and all. She grew up.  <br />  <br />But wait a minute. Did she? In \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,\\" the old Bridget is back, confused and silly as ever, and wearing yet more stupid hats and questionable sweaters.  <br /> <br />And with her, the old movie is back. Nearly intact. The producers might be selling \\"The Edge of Reason\\" as a sequel, but it is so close to the original, in details large and small, that it could be considered the industry's fastest remake to date - three years and change.  <br /> <br />The movie takes place a mere six weeks after the end of the first. Bridget (Renee Zellweger) is swooningly in love with Mark (Colin Firth), who adores her in return. For some reason, though, she is still insecure. She suspects he might be cheating on her, which leads to a few pratfalls as she spies on him.  <br /> <br />Then - hurrah! as Bridget might say -Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) turns up and turns Bridget's head once again with his sly, seductive humor. They wind up in Thailand together, which could be considered new, but is actually just a change of scenery, since Bridget, of course, gets herself into embarrassing trouble there as easily as in London.  <br /> <br />For those who enjoy more of the same, it's a likable enough, light entertainment. Zellweger is still adorable, and Grant is still the funniest thing in the movie. But the second time around, the flaws that we easily overlooked in the first movie are more visible and are suddenly incredibly annoying.  <br /> <br />Chief among them is Bridget herself, and what makes her annoying lies in the difference between the Bridget of the books and the Bridget of the movies. In thebooks, Bridget goes through all manner of humiliations, but the key is that she is writing about them, and so they come to us filtered through her quite wicked, even sophisticated wit. In the movies, Bridget does not get to \\"tell\\" her story; she is the object of the stories, and so all we see are the stupid humiliations without the mitigating wit.  <br /> <br />In short, she looks not like a wit, but like a nitwit. And so, as Bridget stumbles from stupid gaffe to humiliating mistake to embarrassing outburst, just as you're supposed to think, \\"Oh, how cute,\\" instead you're thinking, \\"Does she have the IQ of an inflatable doll?\\"  <br /> <br />\\"I don't get it,\\" I e-mailed a female friend of mine the morning after the preview screening. \\"Is this a movie only a woman could love?\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Actually, it's a movie to make a thinking woman question her love of the first movie. Was Bridget really so retrograde a figure the first time?\\" was her response.  <br /> <br />Perhaps. When Daniel is trying to flatter her into bed, he reminisces about the events of the first movie. \\"You made me laugh, Jones,\\" he says smoothly, \\"though I was always laughing AT you, not with you.\\"  <br /> <br />Which pretty well sums it up, I'd say. <br />

B0006399FS|5.0|Another great CD from the greatest band ever!!! I would write a more drawn out review but I'm busy on this holiday.  Happy thanksgiving, everyone :) <br />P.S. = See Mark Freedman;s review below, great stuff.
B00067BBQE|1.0|So I picked up fallen as it was getting popular and thought it was pretty good. As a debut album, it is really strong and if you like one song, you'll probably like all of them. Then I saw a slew of live material. This is where I must break away from this band as strong performers. Unfortunately for the band, the weak link is Amy Lee. Everyone else seems to have good timing, they know their rifs and everyone gels well enough but this chick can't cary a note in a bucket. The band consistantly uses reverb and ghosting effects on her vocals to cover this up but you'd have to be tone deaf to miss it. Now Amy Lee is cute and she stands for some respectable things when it comes to music and all of that but she is not a good singer, at least not in the arena of live shows. I think they are a pretty good band for studio work and videos but should stick to those or eventually the rest of you may actually listen to her instead of stare and figure out  there are some serious problems in her live performance. So for that reason, i'm giving this DVD 1 star. They did a great job covering her vocal problems up for the most part but I can't, in good conscience, give it a higher rank for the fact that it is so deceptive.
0140277447|1.0|I am saddened at Iris Chang's recent death. She was truly a brilliant young journalist who courageously told the story of Japanese atrocities fabricated by China after WW2. This story, up until now, received little attention in the United States. This I could understand. Yet Ms. Chang, through her relentless quotation, has fictionalized a gruesome and horrific description of human history and told it to the world. I am very pleased by all the comments written on this forum by people who claim these stories are communist China (PRC) propaganda. The Taiwanese in Taiwan (ROT), PRC's archenemy, share the same views on these refutable fabrications of East Asian history. I don't blame the Chinese people and others on this forum, who seem to be using this book review section as their personal blog to argue WW2 facts (some of whom have submitted multiple entries). Perhaps, they are ignorant and misinformed. Perhaps, they just can't accept that the ugliness demonstrated by the Chinese may be a part of them.
B000066JES|5.0|This band continues to pound out thematic non apologetic metal. I saw them live in SF last year and it was the best show I've seen in a long time. Manowar creates an atmosphere of pride and comradery amongst true metal fans and agresion to the perpetrators of \\"false metal\\". This album takes a few risks and whether they pay off for you or not, the anthemic pieces will hook you because they only get better with each album. I can't wait for their next effort.
0670033693|5.0|It has been a long, long time since I've come across a book so filled with amazing characters.  Craig Johnson breathes life into each and every one, whether he be the protagonist, the very human and humorous Sheriff Walt Longmire, or a minor character flipping pancakes at the Firefighter breakfast.  That Johnson loves Wyoming and the general populace that call her home is evident, and I can't wait to see what Walt and the others cook up for us next.  Enjoy, and then read it again...
B0006399FS|1.0|Where to begin. First off- for this kind of music they're the best live band out there (next to springsteen). <br /> <br />Sadly, this record, (along with their last effort, All That You Can't Leave Behind) puts the final nail in the coffin.  It's just....over.  At least ATYCLB had one good track, the Joey Ramone beloved 'In a Little While'.  At the time I thought- ok, Bono's off trying to save the world in that schmaltzy ridiculous way of his so one bad disc is ok.  But this record??? <br /> <br />My contempt for this wasted effort is beyond words.  It started when I looked at the track list: 'sometimes you can't make it on your own' (if you liked REM's 'everybody hurts', this one's for you, and you should be shot)...then there's 'a man and a woman' (all aboard the crap train! a mysterious distance indeed! heavy, Bono...heavy)...'one step closer to knowing'- knowing what Bono?  Knowing that you fly around in a jet trying to feed your ego, i mean- solving the world's problems with politicians that see you as nothing more than an aging rockstar they can get a photo op with? <br /> <br />Excerpt from 'one step closer' (KEYWORD- KNOWING): <br /> <br />'A heart that hurts is a heart that beats...can you hear the drummer slowing'...what???  oh wait! i get it! 'knowing' ryhmes with 'slowing'!  And wait- ALL HEARTS BEAT!  So if your heart BEATS then it HURTS! (bong hit!) and wait...DRUMMERS KEEP the BEAT!!!  Genius!!!  Unless of course you're dead, which the entire band seems to be on this record.   <br /> <br />I do apologize to all U2 fans out there that enjoy this type of uninspired lite-rock nonsense.  Chances are you don't like the complete lo-fi rawness of WAR or the poetic abstract beauty of Unforgettable Fire. If you were to listen to 'Elvis Presley and America' in your mini-van you'd be wondering why you didn't understand it and find yourself longing for the soaring guitars and user friendly hook. <br /> <br />U2 used to be badasses.  Even through their commercialbreakout success with Joshua Tree (a record i find painfully difficult to listen to even today partly due to the melodrama of the record along with the ridiculous melodrama of Rattle and Hum (movie) which made them look like minstrels and fools- but  Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum (cd) still had some great tracks, despite the movie).  They always delivered something redeeming despite themselves.  And when the dark masterpiece Achtung Baby came along- they had the entire concept of relationships by the balls.  Great record. <br /> <br />So what happened?  Who knows.  Who cares!  Paul Hewson, a man that always took himself way too seriously is stuck between saying what he wants to say and saying what he imagines is poli-correct mainstream  right.  For a guy like this- where every piss he takes is a monumental world-changing event in his head, it's suicide.  For the rest of his poor band, well- who wants to F with formula? <br /> <br />I'm glad I'm not Bono and I'm especially glad I'm not in his band or on his payroll.  Most of all, I'm glad I didn't pay for this record. <br /> <br />Thank you Internet!  You can have it back now. <br /> <br />Love, <br /> <br />Christopher <br /> <br />PS- if you find yourself in need of some sort of real music then you can PAY for Twilight Singers- 'Blackberry Bell' <br /> <br />Ciao, Bella. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B000002I4S|5.0|'Giant Steps' overturned many of the stereotypes I had about post-war (more specifically 1950's) jazz. From most of the movies I've seen from that era, jazz was wallpaper music, bland background to the cliches on the screen. Imagine how I felt when I first put on 'Giant Steps'. This is definitely not \\"easy-listening\\". <br /> <br />The energized melody of the title track bursts from the record in a relentless attack. The imagination of Coltrane's playing can best be heard on 'Cousin Mary' where he begins with swing before taking the melody on a world tour from the blues to the Far East. 'Countdown' sounds initially like uncomprimising free-jazz but there is a strong rhythm behind it that you can even snap your fingers to and there isn't a more delightful moment on the album than it's whistful ending. Coltrane's playing on the second version included here is even more astounding. <br /> <br />Coltrane takes us on another journey back and forth between jazz's past and future with 'Spiral', swaying between a swinging tempo and a halting, Eastern-thinged descent. It's emotional intensity is a staple of this remarkable album. On 'Syeeda's Song Flute' the master gives the other players a chance to shine with Tommy Flanagan's playing unthinkably cool and unrelenting at the same time. The track segues ponderously into 'Naima' where Flanagan again comes to the fore with some of his most personal playing, while the saxophone smoulders. <br /> <br />'Mr. PC' combines all the best of John Coltrane and the backing trio on this album. His heady mixture of old-time jazz, swing and his own intense improvisations conspire to deliver a hothouse performance with the other players driving hard behind him. <br /> <br />'Giant Steps' is an album that any serious music lover should have in their collection, artistic, cerebral and emotional all at the same time.
B000062YAZ|1.0|This album is a joke, right?  Could this band be anymore overrated than it actually is?  The sound of someone throwing up for 36 minutes straight would have made a better album than this.  This garbage ranks right down there at the bottom of the crap pile as those death metal bands that do nothing but growl/burp/vomit into a microphone like a bunch of champs.  A \\"hardcore\\" band name doesn't make a band good...the quality of the music does.  Regardless of whether or not they pioneered thrash metal, this is just sad.
0345350499|1.0|HORRIBLE. HOW could one person slaughter Arthur so badly? It's the absolute worst representation of the story I love that I have ever read. It's an abomination! She seems to love smearing the pages with dirty, sickening tripe, turning the best-loved legends into the worst, most disgusting human creatures anyone could inevent. <br />I don't give a dang what all the other reviewers say. Burn your money sooner than buy this junk.
0688014291|4.0|...just started a new part time job and I read this because the owner found it to be extremely influential in her management style. This book is lickety-split-quick. I read it in about two hours. The story is a fable about a young man who wants to meet the ideal manager, who turns about to be a \\"one-minute-manager\\", a composite taken from the authors' research. This book illustrates simple principles in an accessible way with focus on goal setting, affirmation, and effective, though caring, criticism when goals are not met.<br /><br />For me, this is an effective book as this is a new area of research focus for me. If you're starting out with management techniques or understanding management techniques, then books like this provide accessible points of entry into the field. Ultimately, the book struggles with two flaws that reduce my rating. First, I would like to have more access to the research that generated the one-minute-manager. Without that research this book can be viewed as a fictional fable rather than a practical one. Second, I feel that while effective, several of the techniques are not practical for American business. I asked my dad, a Wharton grad, about this book, and he said that it was in vogue for a while in the 1980s and then lost its influence in ways that books like \\"The Seven Habits of Effective People\\" did not. I feel that the reason the book fails is that it treats American employees and employers like rational, grounded individuals. If you read the Wall Street Journal and the newspapers, you realize that Americans are irrational beings and that this ideal is not always practical. Setting goals with a person that has been marginalized culturally, spiritually, economically, and socially is too reductionist an approach. I'm very interested in programs and management styles that will work with difficult employees, the one's that currently sap the strength of most of the large businesses in corporate America and the large institutions such as our public schools. I think that books like \\"The One Minute Manager\\" are best for start ups and new blood who want to impose a new corporate culture on a blank slate. For the majority of businesses that are established and trying to dramatically change course, the ideas in this book will be helpful, but not immediately applicable.<br /><br />--4 stars<br /><br />--SDour public schools.

B0001D0FTW|4.0|A few weeks ago I bought both Edguy's 'Hellfire Club' and Avantasia's 'The Metal Opera' at the same time.  <br /> <br />The Metal Opera came first and I was quite disappointed. Power Metal has never been my favorite genre (I've always been a man of Thrash Metal), but I heard good things so I decided, what the heck? When I got the Metal Opera, I wasn't much looking forward to the Hellfire Club.  <br /> <br />Well, needless to say I was very surprised when it came. This album is CATCHY AS HELL. I was shouting the chorus to the album opener the first time I heard it. This cd has a very epic and complete feel to it , althogh most songs are only 4-5 minutes long, they are very well composed, unique, and all have a 'Here to stay' kind of feel.  <br /> <br />I give it 4.5 since some of the lyrics are lame, and the ballad's 'Forever' and 'the Spirit Will Remain' are kind of week. The best tracks are 'Mysteria', 'King of Fools', 'Navigator', the epic 'the Piper Never Dies', 'Down with the Devil', and 'Under the Moon' has an excellent instrumental section as well.  <br /> <br />I really haven't been listening to anything else for over a week now. Quite a suprise coming from a guy whose favorite metal band is Slayer.. !   <br />So if you are a Thrash fan, give it a try. If you are a Power Metal fan then I guess you already should own this.  <br /> <br />While not perfect, this CD gets a high recommendation from this Thrash fan. Check it out..
B0002BO0AS|5.0|This album is superb and one of the best releases of the last year.  The beats are driving and make you want to move, the guitars are excellent, with some really great solos then the vocals top it off to give you one of the current best metal bands today.  From the opening track this cd had me banging my head in my car, my room or wherever else I would play this cd.  Stand out tracks to me were, The Great Dividers, Black Hearts Now Reign and my personal favorite Zombie Autopilot.  So if your looking for a another metal band to add to your collection you may want to consider Unearth, you'll be addicted trust me.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Wow, its finally here. I remember this is the first DVD I ever bought back about 6 years ago when there were only a hand full of DVD's available. After everything started coming out with extreme loaded features, I wondered when I would get to see a Top Gun special features DVD. ITS HERE!!! I was a little disappointed by Amazon's description because it looks like there may not be many extra interviews with Tom Cruise. Anyways, its still worth the purchase.
B0000584V3|5.0|This album is one of the most talented peices of work I've ever heard.  No matter if the music is softer or harder, faster or slower it is always flawless.  The lyrics on this cd are very poetic and thoughtful, Opeth is never one to just throw a song together they always sit down and take the time to come up with the most inspiring songs they can.  In the midst of the onslaught of new metal bands coming up like: Shadows Fall, Unearth, Lamb of God, As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage etc. Opeth remains in a class all their own, and the previously mentioned bands would do good to take lessons from these guys.  My favorite songs on this album are The Leper Affinity, The Drapery Falls, and Harvest.  If you are looking for hard music that was put together with thought and consideration and REAL talent look no further then Opeth!
B0006399FS|5.0|Another u2 Masterpiece? Could very well be. It might not be at the level of \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby,\\" but its an extremely strong album with no weak tracks, unlike its predecessor ATYCLB. The 2000 album was very strong, but a couple mistakes made it one step away from a \\"masterpiece\\" which a lot of people said it was. However, I found that this album takes a few listens to grow on you and really appreciate. This will explain why a lot of people will give it 1-2 stars after a couple listens, or of course those u2 haters that haven't even heard the album. This album has so many different sounds coming from everywhere (layers of guitars, great double & backing vocals, heavy bass, etc.) This album is another reason why they will be inducted into the Rock n Roll hall of fame in 2005, first ballot.  <br /> <br />1. Vertigo: excellent first single and great opener for the album. U2 just doing an exciting track, loaded with great guitars by Edge and heavy bass by Adam Clayton. Hit written all over it. I could have done without the \\"turn it up loud, captain\\" line, but in the end it's just a fun song (9/10).  <br /> <br />2. Miracle Drug: Almost perfection in every aspect. The first verse is slow, with stunning vocal delievery by Bono, but then jumps at you when the chorus hits. The highlights of the track are done by Edge, who does a phenomenal slide guitar solo, and then sings the following verse by himself. Chills...Incredible song (9.5/10).  <br /> <br />3. Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own: I think this is one of the most emotional songs u2 have ever recorded, very confessional lyrics. The \\"and it's you when I look in the mirror..\\" line sung in falsetto is breaktaking, the chorus is undeniable, and the understated, brilliant guitar work underneath it is perfect. I think the bridge might be a little overdone, but this is a big future single. (9/10)  <br /> <br />4. Love and Peace or Else: Is this u2? Who said this album didn't have the usual experimentation?This track has masterful production as u2 do their best Nine-inch Nail impersonation. Simply stated, this song rocks! And to tell you the truth, it had to with Bono serving the only political lyrics on the album. Supersonic, dark, evil, distorted riffs from Edge throughout, and great solo to close off the song. A couple corny lines bring the grade down a little (8/10).  <br /> <br />5. City of Blinding Lights: Epic u2. Beautiful build-up with the piano and guitar start this very 80s-sounding tune. I think Bono owns this track, great lyrics and delivery, and an addicitve chorus which will be a big hit on the next tour. \\"Time won't leave me as I am, but time won't take the boy out of this man\\". How can I hate on a song with a line like this in it? (8.5/10)  <br /> <br />6. All Because of You: The best song on the album. The intro makes me want to cry it's so good, the Edge let loose and running wild! It's just a stomping, sing-along rocker with Bono yelling and bouncing you off the walls. It's like the Who made a cameo on the record, very 60's rock here. The way Bono yells the bridge (\\"I'm alive, I'm being born..\\") is one of his greatest moments, and Edge's guitar solo is one of his finest(11/10)!!!  <br /> <br />7. A Man and a Woman: Now is when the album will require multiple listens. This tune is the epitome of SOUL, people will think it's too R&B but that was the goal of this track. Bono wanted to make \\"a summer Marvin Gaye\\" tune, and listening to this makes me wonder if they were signed to Motown all these years. The dominator: Adam Clayton. Incredible bass completes this sing-a-long tune that grows on you more and more (8/10).  <br /> <br />8. Crumbs from Your Table: Biggest surprise of the record, it is pretty brilliant. Edge swallows the track and dominates it with his guitar work. Bono's delivery makes this chorus amazing, very catchy..the lyrics are very strong, especially the second verse. Very nice surprise, a lot rawer and harder than I expected (8.5/10).<br /> <br />9. One Step Closer: People say it's the weakest track on the record but I can't understand that. It has such incredible vocal delivery by Bono and fits the music and theme of the song to perfection. It really would have been a good fit on \\"Zooropa\\". The Lyrics are just genius to me, and maybe they could have done something more with the chorus, but it has this wierd feeling which grows on you. Took many listens to feel all this, keep in mind (8/10).  <br /> <br />10. Original of the Species = Although I absolutely love this song, I have the most trouble with it because of what it could have been. First off, this the closest anyone has ever come to sounding like the Beatles. It is incredible, great piano and its place on the album is perfect. My problem is the over-production, what a mistake! There is too many things going on here, especially the strings. It should have been more stripped down, it would be far more intimate. And get rid of the \\"doo doo doo\\" line by Bono, ugghhh (7.5/10).  <br /> <br />11. Yahweh: Despite the wierd-sounding title of the song, this has geniunely great lyrics and ends the album very well. The chorus is a little annoying, but the last half of this track is perfect. One of their stronger album closers, but definetly a grower (7/10).  <br /> <br />Here's a statement of how strong this record is: the only real mistake was not adding \\"Fast Cars\\" to the regular edition! It is pure brilliance, u2 at their most experimental. It is a middle-eastern influenced tune with Arabic guitars by Edge and hip hop style vocals by Bono. What a gem, they left it off the album and I could see it being a single. \\"I know these fast cars...will do me no good.\\" One of the best on the album.  <br /> <br />u2 arent changing music history here. I don't know why some u2 fans want them to do this with every release. It is just a very strong rock record filled with songs I can't wait to hear live. Because as good as their album work is, their songs comealive on tour. A new masterpiece? Only time will tell, but it takes time and multiple listens to really fall in love and appreciate this great record.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Ummm, if you like this movie, then it is because you have the same sense of humor as me.  My friend and I went to it and when we sat down we noticed an old woman a few rows in front of us.  Cool!  Not everyone here is college aged, now that is one cool old lady.  Right as the movie was starting, an old man walks in and walks over to the old woman (husband and wife, I'd guess), and goes \\"Wrong movie.  wrong theatre.\\"  D'oh!  The couple exited as the beginning bus scene unfolds on the large screen.  My point?  You either get it, or you are in the wrong movie theatre.
B000000OAL|5.0|Over the years I've listened to several bands, but Queen takes the cake.  As a Queen fan I've come to appreciate this album more and more.  <br />  <br />  It starts with a hard-rock song called \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\",  a build up of what's to come.  <br /> <br />  \\"Doing All Right\\" is a nice soft song that changes it's tone occaisonaly when Brian May jams his guitar.   <br /> <br />  \\"Great King Rat\\" is Freddie Mercury's first song on the album. It has a heavy metal melody so listen at your own risk.  <br /> <br />  \\"My Faiy King\\" is another Freddie Mercury score.  The well-strung together song is the obvious leadup to Queen's later hit \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".  <br /> <br />  \\"Liar\\" is perhaps one of the more popular tracks on the album and you can listen for yourself what this song is all about.   <br /> <br />  \\"The Night Comes Down\\" allows you to take a rest from the former track. <br /> <br />  \\"Modern Times Rock 'N' Roll\\" is Roger Taylor's first song. The track obviously has a rock 'n' roll style. <br />   <br />  The weakest score on the album has to be \\"Son and Daughter\\", due to it's unattractive melody.  Not a bad song, just the \\"worst of the best\\".  <br /> <br />  \\"Jesus\\" is Freddie Mercury's dedication to Christ, an Ode if you will.  <br /> <br />  \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" is a a short preview of Queen's next album, but that's a review for another day...  <br /> <br />  All in all, Queen is a excellent album, well worth your money.  Besides, you won't be able to call yourself a Queen fan until you own this still-shining gem.
0385336810|5.0|The character in the book, Emma, is hilarious!  I really enjoyed reading the book and learning about her most personal, intimate thoughts.  And, as a girl in the 20's myself, I share many of the same secrets...  secrets that I am embarrassed to tell others.  The book started a bit slow for me but I could not put the book down after a few chapters!  Must Read!!
1400032717|4.0|This book is remarkably original and each word is full of a genuine flavor.  It's clear that this author has spent time with autistic children, enough time to really be able to get inside their heads.  The voice of the first-person narrator is just right, infused with an innocence that makes him charming but also with a frustrating stubbornness in his compulsive-obsessive behavior and his often non-sequiturial thought process.<br /><br />Mark Haddon is an award-winning children's author, and several times throughout this book I wondered whether he was ready for adult fiction.  The simplicity of the writing has a certain beauty to it, but that wears off about a hundred pages into the book and becomes a bit tedious.  And the plot is about as simple as they come.  Perhaps that was an intentional technique, to illustrate how an autistic child sees the world in terms of black and white, without the complexity of the infinite shades of gray.  Or perhaps it's because Haddon isn't skilled enough to develop an elaborate plot.<br /><br />Despite that criticism, as a character sketch this is a fine novel, and certainly worth the better part of an afternoon that it takes to read it.
B0000028WD|5.0|A beautiful mix of classic Dylan songs like \\"Toombstone Blues...\\"  to lesser known gems like \\"Seven Days.\\" I also loved fantastic remakes of \\"Master of War\\" and \\"Just Like a Woman\\" amongst others.<br /><br />This is a true tribute album to one of the most prolific artists of our times.
B0006399FS|4.0|Being a big fan of U2, I just bought the new CD and popped it in the CD player.<br /><br />The first track is Vertigo.  Great song, fun, rockin all the way in the vein of Elevation or even something off of Pop.<br /><br />Second track hits (Miracle Drug), and it's slow! I was like what?  That's the way to kill momentum of an album for sure...<br /><br />\\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\" is a great 3rd track, but again slow.  Would have been better placed later on...<br /><br />4th and 5th tracks get it rockin again.<br /><br />The 4th being \\"Love and peace or else\\"... Starting off sounding like something that would have been on Pop.  Great tune<br /><br />5th City of blinding lights - another solid song<br /><br />All because of you (one of my favorites) is another solid song that keeps it mildly rocking<br /><br />The rest of the album is decent, but pretty forgettable until you come to Yahweh.  A great spirtual song with lyrics you have to listen to.<br /><br />Overall is this Zooropa?  No!<br /><br />Is it \\"All that you can't leave behind\\"? No.<br /><br />Fans should be happy after a few listens to this CD that takes itself none too seriously and finds it's own unique speed and style.<br /><br />Will probably go down as my 4th favorite CD by U2<br /><br />#1 Joshua Tree<br /><br />#2 Achtung Baby<br /><br />#3 All that you can't leave behind<br /><br />#4 How to dismantle an atomic bomb<br /><br />But with those top 3 CD's, it's hard to top those classics.
B00009RGBS|5.0|For all those narrowminded idiots who are saying that CHICAGO beat Seabiscuit for the best picture OSCAR------ you are wrong. CHICAGO won a year before Seabiscuit. Lord of the Rings beat Seabsicuit. Catherine Zeta is amazing. Listen to her songs and watch her dancong. And--- they can't help that CHICAGO is all about murder and audltery. That is what the play is about--- but in the play the merry murderesses wear lingerie.
B0006399FS|4.0|Okay, I am a huge U2 fan. Ever since Unforgettable Fire. I admit I kinda tuned out during the Zooropa/Pop Mart era because I felt the band had turned into rich rock stars than being a rock band. I felt they redeemed themselves on All Things.. <br />But being a huge fan of the early work, and hearing the great mix on the Live in Boston DVD, I had secrectly wondered how the band would sound if they went back to Steve Lillywhite as producer (like when he produced October & Boy). My reasoning was that the band went back to Eno & Lanois for All things and it was the best album since Joshua Tree. Plus Lillywhite gave incredible sound to Dave Matthews and Counting Crows it would only be fitting that he would do the same for U2. <br /> <br />Well, it's hard to say if I should have watched what I wished for. <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong, I think U2 are the greatest.  <br /> <br />I do admit, that with all of the talk of the new release (some compairing it to The Who's - Who's Next and claiming it is their best work ever and Edge has has some of the most powerful work he has ever produced) I got pretty excited. I was a little unsure of the title but then again I thought Achtung Baby was the dumbest title for a CD when I heard it announced. Plus when I heard Vertigo I thought for sure that this CD was going to be something that would be huge. <br /> <br />Well, I have been listening to this CD for three days now and it feels a little bit of a let down..but.than I listen to songs like City of Blinding Light, Miracle Drug, All Because of You, Yahweh and I feel those elemnts of Boy & October that I was looking for. <br /> <br />The only song I don't like is Love and Peace or Else, to me that song is nothing more than a giant cluster F-BOMB. <br /> <br />This CD won't have as many hits as All Things or Joshua Tree, but this album when played in the background while driving or working or hanging out with friends, this CD will wash over you. <br /> <br />I admit, I have beenlisitng to All Things and Boy and Atomic Bomb doesn't quite break out as strongly as these CD's but it does leave it's mark. <br /> <br />
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I just bought the Gilmore Girls on DVD and sat down to watch it for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not to often you find a show with no offense language. I loved every episode! You definitely see a strong bond between Rory and Lorelei. Can't wait for season 2 to be released..
B00003CX95|3.0|Hello how are you I'm fine thanks. Anyway I was born in Canada 1970 to Scottish parents and lived most of the 70s there and moved to Scotland in 1982 where I've been ever since. So I consider myself basically Scottish. I bought Braveheart a few years ago since I was intrigued at Hollywood  producing a  film on Scottish history. Not the romantisised Rob Rob stuff, but a serious film on Scottish history, which to me seemed highly unusual! So William Wallace... the so called national hero of Scotland. Except I'd only heard of his name fleetingly when I browsed thru a book on Scottish history owned by my mother who was a history enthusiast. In fact I was more taken with the fact given in the book that the Scots beat the English at the Battle of Chevy Chase! What, the Saturday Night Live guy?! So the idea that William Wallace is revered by every Scot alive seems a misconception. <br /> <br />Anyay the film itself. In all honesty the first time I saw it I was  a little disappointed. The film sometimes seems to drag. The reason it's long is to make it \\"epic\\" supposdly, but rather than spend lenghty shots on one character I would have preferred the extra time on other things. The film is slightly too slow paced. <br /> <br />The acting is generally well done, and Mel Gibsons accent is 75% correct. Sophie Marceau is easy on the eyes, but for me the high point is Patrick McGoohan as Edward 1. A wild eyed look, and you can never be sure what he's going to do next ( well the first time you see the film anyway!) A chilling performance. I particularly liked the scene where his son is waiting for him after the sack of York nd all you hear is his footsteps climbing the stairs, and the camera slowly zooms in on the door.  <br /> <br />The film can be moving in parts, paticularly in the scenes where Wallace sees the spirit of Murron. The climax of the film where Wallace is about to be beheaded and he sees Murron, and then the camera does a slow motion of the handkechief dropping fromhis hand, while the shot of the sky symobolises the release of his spirit, was moving enough to draw a few tears from me the first time I saw it. <br /> <br />The cinematography of the film is well done, and as Mel Gibson remaraked the setting of the film lends itself well to anamorphic widescren. Not much happening in the vetical but to capture the feel of the landsape you need the widescreen format. As for the scenery itself, I was quite pleased that it seems to have inspired many North Amecians to visit Scotland. Great...except most of the movie was filmed in Ireland! The first third of the film, in the hilly glens was filmed around Inverness (in Scotland), but the battle scenes were filmed in Ireland. Which is beuatiful scenery in it's own right, but I can't help but feel that some are being conned when they think that wide open grass plains are Scotland. \\"Edinburgh Castle\\" in the movie is actually a castle in Ireland I believe. Maybe for some the scenery is a big part of Bravehearts appeal, but when you live everyday in similar surroundings, the wow factor just aint there. But aside from the scenery the costumes are well done, and the building interiors do have a medieval \\"ambience\\" So visually, Braveheart is hard to fault. <br /> <br />Some Engliah people hate this movie because they see it as anti-English. Some Scottish hate it because it seems to further perpetuate the image of Scots as kilt wearing, grubby whisky swillers. Point taken, but......IT'S ONLY A MOVIE! I'm  not concerned with that kind of stuff, Im just concerned with Braveheart as 2.5 hours of cinematic entertainment. <br /> <br />The story is a good uplifting one, it's well made and the acting is good, but for some reason  I can't help but feel that it could have been just a bit better. Since so little is actually known about Wallace, part of the movie is educated guess, and part of it pure fiction for dramatic purposes . ( The most obvious being that Wallace never met the Princess, and neverimpregnated her. So the idea that Wallace \\"bred out\\" the English line was an almost unforgivable artistic liberty in my view) )I think of it as a good movie, rather than a classic movie. It doesn't make me think \\"It makes me feel proud that The Yanks make a film aboot oor national hero!\\", but I do find it a refreshing attmept to portray a liite known area of history, even if the film itslef isn't quite as good as it thinks it is. Still recommended. <br /> <br />By the way some people say that if you really want a film about Scotland see Trainspotting or Sweet Sixteen. They'e more \\"real\\" apparently. Well, real for about 5% of the population. Scotland is not just glens, mountians and kilts. On the other hand it's not just about drugs, gangland and destitution either! In reality it lies soemwhere betwen these two extremes.
B0002TT0NW|3.0|I am a Harry Potter extream fan. I have read all the books over 4 times and sceen all the movies many times. I thought that all the HP movies left some stuff out. I also heard that some people thought that the movie was made a little darker then the first two. This is because the books get darker from now on...POA is where is turns. One MAJOR problem I have with the movie is the clothes. I am pretty sure that there is no \\"Old Navy\\" or \\"Gap kids\\" in Hogsmead so where did they get there clothes from. I want there uniforms back.I don't want Columbus to come back, but I also don't want Cuaron to come back either. I think that Tim Burton should direct at least one of them. Maybe Goblet of fire.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This CD is not new and i still keep it in rotation!!! This is an ALBUM just like back in the day, when every song was a potential single!  Her voice is in the strong middle \\"C\\" like our beloved Whitney!  The lyrics have depth and the music simply compliments it like butter to hot bread!  I have had several encounters where I have met India one on one both before her first the release of this album and after and I must say that I don't particulary care for her as a person.  In each instance she seemed quite rude, self absorbed and egotistical, however, I do have the ability to separate the two and do hope that she works on her humility and grace. I said that to make the point that good music cannot be denied. This CD is worth every dollar and she'll be around for a long time!
B000002NIW|5.0|I'm a very large deftones fan, in my opinion they are one of the best bands ever to grace this earth. I have all four of their albums, from Adrenaline to the Self-Titled. They all have their charms, but this album tops them all. Not that their other releases are anything near bad! Not too many tracks, but the feel of the album and quality of the songs make up for it. Songs: <br /> <br />My Own Summer (shove it) - Great song, first heard this a few years ago on the matrix soundtrack (and hated it...) but listened to it recently, now i love it, but i admit to skipping over it sometimes. Not the best song on the album, but a killer intro track. Steph's (Guitarist) intro piece is absolutely awesome. I heard it was written when the singer put aluminium foil over the windows in his boiling hot hotel room and make-beleived he was in an apocalytic world where the sun was gone - and called it his own summer. <br /> <br />Lhabia - Pretty good too, very catchy chorus, great interlude piece. one of the better songs on the album. (Yes, the name is almost spelt like a part of the female anatomy - don't really see how it relates to the song, but it probably does in some way...) <br /> <br />Mascara - DEFTINITELY one of their best songs ever. It has this weird quiet charm, not something you'd expect from the Deftones, not really nice and sweet like Teenager but with a darker almost gothic feel, a dreary but beautiful song that I love listening to. Beautiful lyrics, sounds almost like he's talking about looking at all the faults of the girl he's with but, but feeling something about her just drives him insane with passion (her long shady eyes?), and can't help but make this night all about her. <br /> <br />Around the Fur - HELL YESSSSS!!!! excellent heavy song. I love the screaming, i used to listen to this song alone over and over again. fabulous. Talks about the underground people (as in prostitutes and stuff), and seems to take a stab at the high society and fasions. <br /> <br/>Rickets - ehhh... I like this (its deftones!!) but it definitely pales next to all the other songs. Still cool though. <br /> <br />Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) - Holy flurking shnit. This song is de bomb. I'm not suprised it's been called the best deftones song ever by many. Wow. Long, but heaven every second. A great soothing song, I could fall asleep to it, and i'm sure i'd have dreams of being driven away into the night at unbeleivable speeds by a gorgeous woman. <br /> <br />Lotion - This is probably my favourite damn song on this whole damn album. damn! Heavy in the verses where chino (vocalist) sounds like he's having an angry outburst of temporary insanity which slides into an amazingly adrenaline-pumping chorus that shows off chino's awesome vocal talents - and abe's drumming sounds awesome in the chorus, the transition between verse/chorus just clicks for me... wow... <br /> <br />Dai the Flu - Cool bass, Chi!!! I heard somewhere that \\"Dai\\" is part of Chi's name too, one of his middle names or something. Groovy song, i like it heaps (my sister loves it too, its her favourite on this album). Sweet-ass. <br /> <br />Rickets - This song is cool, but it took a little getting used to for me. Its rather heavy and seems to show off the classical deftones sort of sound, like in Engine #9 off adrenaline. I admit to skipping over it though, because the tune in deftones is the thing that wins me over, and this song doesn't have that much tuneful stuff... still good. <br /> <br />MX - Veeeeeery good song. Has this weird verse part where chino talks to this chick, it sounds really cool, especially when you listen to what he's saying. This song is kinda scary, the chorus is \\"hahahaha... Come over here, over here, Closer to Lung, hahaha... So I can, So I can, Shove her over railing.\\".... whoah dude.... SWEET AS!  <br /> <br />I love the amazing pictures deftones songs build, and the subject matter of their music. Its harsh real beauty. Besides the fact they make cool-ass music, the lyrics send you on these crazy mind trips... they do to me anyway. When I listen to MX i connect it with the image on the front of the album, that rather attractive woman with her legs in the water, especially since at the start of the song you hear some water-like sounds, and some of the vocals sound all bubbly like they're underwater... Lotion is such a great angry-sounding song, and the chorus sounds sarcastic and almost mocking... \\"Mascara\\" has this weirdly romantic feel to it, but its not fake-sounding or overly sappy... i think chino (and whoever else contributes to the lyrics) understands that words are just words, that there are many ways to express feelings... and that life isn't as black-and-white as its perceived in many other bands and songs (\\"I love you, you're perfect, let's come together and live together forever happily ever after....\\"). The guys in the deftones seem so honest and genuine with their music and thats why they hold about number 1 in my list of favourite bands (tied with 36 Crazyfists & System of a Down). Buy this CD now, its worth it dudes.
0345315227|1.0|I really tried to like this book, but in the end I have to say that it is crap.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Like any other recently sci-fi movies released, I Robot has the advantage of digital technology to make the robot characters believable.  The speed of the story equals to the original novel.  Though almost the same dialogues are used, somehow the movie failed to deliver the same 'feel'.   <br /> <br />If you're expecting to see The Matrix equal, you're in for disappoinment.  However, if you like action movies, this is your good pick.  It's like watching Bad Boys III with futuristic flavor.
B0002Y4T92|2.0|I watched the thing waitng for Jeff Beck (as advertised). There were seconds of a close up of \\"Cause we've ended as lovers\\" and that's it. Piss poor advertising.
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge has made the best CD I've listened to in a long time. The debut album from this band is AWESOME!!! From the first track to the last, each song brings out a different emotion. My personal favorite is \\"One Day Remains\\". Being a guitarist myself, I always listen to the guitars first. Mark Tremonti has been blowing me away ever since \\"My Own Prison\\" with Creed. He has truly evolved with this CD. Do yourself a favor and get this CD. You will listen to it every day in yor car or at work and will be longing for the day when they play a concert near you. And go see them live. I've seen them twice and they are incredible!!! I hope this review helps...go get this CD!!!
B0000DZEE3|2.0|<br />Ok first of all, i'm really not a fan of the rhcp, but i'm definitely a fan of the song \\"under the bridge.\\" That's the only reason why i bought the dvd. I saw the rhcp performed on vh1 at someone's backyard pool party for an hour or so set, and i thought they were just an average garage band that adds funk/rap to rock n roll.  <br /> <br />now with that said, I really didn't think that john is spcecial at all. He can't be more average than that! hence, he's not known among guitar gods (steve vai, hendrix, satriani, malmsteen, etc)!  <br /> <br />lead singer's voice does his job just fine. <br /> <br />flea has some really nice and interesting hook.  <br /> <br />drummer is just fine.  <br /> <br />maybe it's just me, but i really didn't like the rapping! I use to listen to undergroup hip hop mc's and to go from that and listen to anthony rap is a disrespect in a way.  <br /> <br />reminds me of limp bizkit and some other corny ass mtv pop bands that adds rap into rock. eys yes yes, i know that run dmc and aerosmith paved the way for these kids, but come on, you can't say that it works! i hate it. i give them props for being original.  <br /> <br />I think what killed it for me is the fact that 90 percent of the song on this dvd has some sorta rap in it.  <br /> <br />of course the dvd was professionally made, and i appreciate that. freakin' matrix! nice! <br /> <br /> <br />so all in all, i felt like the rhcp does not fit my taste, and i feel that john's guitar playing should not be talked about. cuz it's not even worth it. go buy joe satriani's dvd or steve vai's dvd. those are the real hardcore pros. any guitar beginners can play what john does.
B0006399FS|5.0|Good morning, & thank you for give me the oportunity for review the new U2 album. <br /> <br />I don't believe the reviews for the other people. This album deserving 4 star for minimum. It's very disence studio album, the band returns for the old style but renewing the tunes & the mixing form. The edge gave him, very much freedom, and the bass of adam clayton is very great, larry mullen & his drums are amazing, & the voice of Bono is very desence for the tematic of this album. The are very great songs, & good lyrics but not perfect like other albums (Joshua Tree, acthung baby). <br /> <br />My opinion is: this album is very desence for the band with 26 years of history & the most great songs of the music history. <br /> <br />This album revives the old style, but renewing the form. <br /> <br />& not is a band thing revives the past music of U2.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I love this CD!  I've had it for almost 1 year now, but thought I'd share with those who'll be out buying Christmas CD's.  Make sure this one is in your collection!!  Whitney gives her all on this CD (like she really has too, it's really effortless); she doesn't have to try hard at all.  But I think she put a lot of heart into it.  All the tracks are nice, she even has one with her daughter!  Buy it, you'll be glad you did.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought this CD about a month ago on a whim.  I had heard and liked one of his songs (I Don't Want To Be), and since he has been touring with one of my favorite artists, Michael Tolcher, I decided to buy Chariot.  Although I have only owned it for a short time, it has quickly become one of my favorites.  It has a unique and soulful sound, and is one the few CD's I own that I can listen to from beginning to end without skipping a single song.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone!
B000063DFQ|4.0|I couldn't give this album the full monty, because it really isn't perfect. That's because of Tracks 7 and 8, \\"Quest for Fire\\" and \\"Sun and Steel\\". I enjoy listening to both of those songs every once in awhile, but not all the time. They are both kinda good, but aren't anything spectacular at all. <br /> <br />Hence my rating of 4.5. <br /> <br />The title of this review states \\"The Golden Era Begins\\". I wirte that because(obviously) this is when the Golden Era for Iron Maiden began band member wise. They would carry this lineup through their Seventh album \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\".  <br /> <br />And that lineup looked a little something like this: <br /> <br />Steve Harris-Bass Guitar <br />Dave Murray-Lead Guitars <br />Bruce Dickinson-Lead Vocals <br />Nicko McBrain-Drums <br />Adrian Smith-Lead Guitars <br /> <br />The change they made to the lineup was bringing in Nicko McBrain for Clive Burr. Clive was great and talented but Nicko stuck. Every since \\"Piece of Mind\\" Nicko McBrain has been on every Iron Maiden album up to the most recent album \\"Dance of Death\\"(2003). The song lineup is goes as followed: <br /> <br />1.Where Eageles Dare <br />2.Revelations <br />3.Flight of Icarus <br />4.Die with your Boots On <br />5.The Trooper <br />6.Still Life <br />7.Quest for Fire <br />8.Sun and Steel <br />9.To Tame a Land <br /> <br />Even if you don't own this album I'm sure you have heard both \\"Flight of Icarus\\" and \\"The Trooper\\". They were the 2 biggest singles off \\"Piece of Mind\\" and are both excellent songs. \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" is the perfect way to start off the album as new drummer Nicko shows off his talent right from the start. \\"Revelations\\" is also excellent, as Bruce shows off his song writing talent. \\"Die with your Boots On\\" is a great catchy tune, that will impress the heck out of you. \\"Still Life\\" is one of my favorite songs off the album, and it's basically the title track. It starts slow, and builds too an extremely tremendous chorus. I've alreadygiven my opinion on \\"Quest for Fire\\" and \\"Sun and Steel\\" at the beginning off my review. They are both solid yet unspectacular. The longest track on the album is the closer \\"To Tame a Land\\". Some people say that they were just trying to make another \\"Hallowed be thy Name\\" with this song, but I believe that that is crap. This is absolutley nothing like that classic, and it is great in it's own way. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd reccomend this to any fan of the band, or just anyone looking for good music. <br />
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This album is nothing short of amazing.  Chariot is wonderful, but Stripped only serves as proof of Gavin DeGraw's incomparable talent. Listening to Stripped makes me feel as if I am actually at a live show.  There are no pre-recorded vocal or instrumental tracks, everything is 100% real.  It is truly an awesome album.
B0006399FS|2.0|oh my God what is this ???? I can't believe what I just listen. This is not U2 !!!!. <br /> <br />Where is the social band ? <br />Where is the avant-garde band ? <br /> <br />the ironic thing about all this, is that U2 haters are happy, but fans like me are so sad and deceived by this album. <br />A quick song by song review: <br /> <br />1- Vertigo: Rock song. Below average <br /> <br />2- Miracle Drug: Mid Tempo song. Decent <br /> <br />3- Sometimes You Can't...: Ballad. Horrible and boring. Bono ruins the song. Skip this track. <br /> <br />4- Love And Peace Or Else: Rock. Bono ruins the song. So so. <br /> <br />5- City Of Blinding Lights: Mid Tempo. Great One, the best of the album. <br /> <br />6- All Because Of You: Rock. Bono ruins the song. so so <br /> <br />7- A Man And A Woman: Ballad. Bono ruins the song. Skip this track <br /> <br />8- Crumbs For Your Table: Mid Tempo. Another good one. <br /> <br />9- One Step Closer: Ballad. Filler song. Skip this track <br /> <br />10- Original Of Species: Ballad. Boring and false. Bono ruins the song once again. Just listen those do-do-do. Skip this track <br /> <br />11- Yahweh: Mid Tempo. Bono ruins a great melody. so so <br /> <br /> <br />It's clear the worst thing here is Bono. His voice is awful, really. I know some fans think is great because he can reach higher notes, but those higher notes sound terrible. <br />Overall, below average album, if you can, download it. <br />
B00066VUPM|5.0|Travis, they are really the nicest people in the world, and I hate celebs. This album contains all their singles from their four brilliant albums, from 'Good feeling' to '12 Memories'. It also includes the single only 'Coming Around' which is good, the new uplifting single 'Walking in the Sun' and the 'Distance; which I think is great. Apparently this is the first of the planned four best of albums from Travis, so we will be seeing this Scottish band for a long time to come, which of course is not a bad thing. This is a great introduction to this band which never broke the US. Can't recomend it enough.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I was born in January of 1956. This film was released in 1959.  This is my first recollection of a film.  My cousin, who was 15 years older than I, took me to the film with my sister who was nine.<br /><br />It maybe nostalgia, but this film has a place in my heart.  The DVD has spectacular color and graphic design, Cinderella- Snow White does not compare with quality or the artistic backgrounds, foregrounds that make this a classic.  Is this classic Disney?  How can anyone deny this?  This is the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Jim
B00000IOSU|5.0|This was the C.D that introduced me to Sarah Mclachlan.  It portrays her as what she is, a top notch live performer.  Her voice and guitar/piano playing is cristal clear on each of the live songs.  I like all the songs here, however I do think that some of her earlier works or more songs than just \\"hit singles\\" should have been included in here.  With that aside, I think all the songs here are enjoyable listens that capture the energy of a live performance.  I especially enjoyed the following... <br /> <br />Building a Mystery-this is a really fun song to listen to because of the lyrics. They really make you wonder who she's   singing about. <br />Hold On- emotionally charged and beutifully delivered. <br />I will Remember You- This is the type of song that makes you feel sentimental. (For some reason, though, she didn't sing the first verse!!?)  <br />Adia- another radio-hit classic. <br />Do What You Have to Do- tear jerking piano ballad <br />Th Path of Terms- The only song from solace, one of my favorites. <br />Fear- haunting lyrics and killer vocals. <br />Posession- creepie <br />Sweet Surrender- phenomonal <br />Ice Cream- the lyrics here are kind of silly but fun. <br />Fumbling Towards Ecstacy- what a great song/album title! <br />Angel-eerily beautiful piano ballad.  <br />
B00008J4P5|4.0|There's some rather mixed reviews on this one. My opinion falls into the middle territory, neither is it the greatest album in the past 20 years (or 2 years), nor is it the worst. It's an above-average album by competant musicians.  <br /> <br />There has been some criticism of the White Siblings' musical talent. I would agree with the minimalist view (just listen to \\"In the Cold Cold Night\\" and \\"I Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\" - two of my favorites btw). I don't really see what warrrants the harsh criticism of White's songwriting abilities. While no John Lennon, he can write a catchy song with the best of them (his style reminds me of Paul McCartney - for good or bad).   <br /> <br />If you've ever seen the White Stripes live, you would agree that a live setting is their medium for showing off their skills. But like all good albums, they don't indulge in fancy/meaningless riffs/fills. It's simplicity at it's best and a lot of people used to modern music can't comprehend simplicity. In that regard, Jack White reminds me of Stevie Ray Vaughan - not in guitar virtuosity, but in minimalism. Playing only what is necessary, not what is pop at the time. <br /> <br />Meg White singing on \\"In the Cold Cold Night\\" is fantastic and reminds me of all that Japanese Pop singing. And \\"Girl You Have No Faith in Medicine\\" is a great little blues/punk tune. People seem to take this band too seriously, even the band isn't taking themselves seriously. Overall this is a great album to add to your collection. Not the best album, but a memorable one nevertheless.
B0002TT0NW|1.0|Talk about a disappointment. This movie succeeded at completely ruining my hope that the HP series could effectively be laid out on screen. <br />The books themselves are good, I don't care what anyone says. They have something, something that just makes you enjoy reading and uncovering all you can about the characters. When hearing that they would be made into movies, I kind of raised an eyebrow. Books like this couldn't be recreated on film, I thought. <br />The first movie ended up silencing some of my complaints. It wasn't great or anything, but upon leaving the theater you could feel that the show at least tapped into the so-called magic the book creates. Things were portrayed quite nice, and fell about as in tune to the book as I could expect. <br />Never saw all the second movie but it seemed okay. It was when I popped in the third installment that I hung my head. <br />Its laughable. There is no doubt that directors changed, as the golden glow of Columbus and the childlike joy and wonder he brings out through the actors is gone. Its like when the third Home Alone came out - new director copying old ideas, and the show tanked. Replacing rich colors and magic atmospheres is cold blacks and absolutely worthless scene transitions that I guess are supposed to be \\"artistic\\". Gone is the feeling of aged wisdom in the adults at Hogwarts (perhaps, in part, because the actor who played Dumbledore died - he just couldn't be replaced, as he played it as perfect as anyone could want), and also gone is the feeling of mysterious alure of the castle itself. In this show, key locations and sets were changed, and the little treasures of set design that made the first two shows vanished.  <br />The actors were there but it felt like their passion to play the parts had left. Everything was glossed up, Hollywood style, but even so the viewer can see through to the loss of onscreen magic. <br />I'm sorry to say it, but it looks like the series - of movies, that is - is going nowhere but downhill.  <br /> <br />
B00066N8JS|5.0|In 1994, Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor unleashed the modern day classic that is \\"The Downward Spiral\\".  Ten years later, the album still holds up to being a masterpiece and found the outfit gaining much commercial success.  Now, this new Deluxe Edition of the album is available, which includes the original album in remastered SACD stereo sound, and a bonus disc including 13 b-sides, remixes, and rarities.  At first, I found it almost impossible of even the idea of remixing a dark and gritty album without taking away it's gritty heart, but I've got to give Trent credit, he's done it.  Every track from \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\", to \\"Piggy\\", to \\"March of the Pigs\\", to \\"Closer\\", to the classic closing track \\"Hurt\\" sound better than ever, and if you own a SACD player, you need to pick this up, regardless of if you own the original album.  The bonus disc includes mostly previously released material that NIN most likely already own, such as the cover of \\"Dead Souls\\" from the Crow soundtrack and the cover of \\"Memorabilia\\" from the \\"Closer to God\\" CD single.  That aside, whether you are a new NIN fan or a long time listener, you should pick this up, and if you are all of the above and own a SACD player, then consider this a must own.
B0006399FS|5.0|hey ekow, listening to the 'bomb' <br />and the more i listen, the more <br />i think this album really is <br />up there - beyond-before-equal to <br />with their best: achting, josh, u. <br />fire, and war. no longer do i have <br />to rely on loyalty to love this <br />band. i am genuinely excited, nay, <br />turned ON by u2 again and that's <br />what made me fall in love with them <br />in the first place. they make me love <br />life and boy am i looking forward <br />to one of the best events my life has <br />to offer and guarantee: living and loving <br />with you at camp AAG! <br /> <br />Lay down, lay down your sweet love <br />down on the track, we're gonna break <br />the AAG's back! <br /> <br />roll on our treasure: togetherness <br />causing havoc and obscene respect <br />in the same town. <br /> <br />let's stay alive for a long long time! <br /> <br />i will follow <br /> <br />pablo k <br /> <br />p.s. the 'bomb' is as if achtung  <br />and josh mated and gave birth! <br />

1577311760|5.0|Those that have written that this book is not essenstial teachings of liberation haved missed the essence.  Only the mind could critique The Power of Now, because it has nothing to do with good or bad or good teaching or bad teaching.  It a sign post pointing the way home.  The thing is Tolle, along with Ramana Maharshi, speak without any ego at all.  They are not even there.  It is simply consciousness.  It is the essence of all life that is speaking, so there is nothing to critique.  They have planted the closest signposts to the truth, because they happen to be there, there is nothing there, only pure life.  So how can one critique pure life.  If one is still, one will know that there is nothing to dispute and nothing to argue over.  There is non-duality.  This book happens to be the greatest sign-post ever erected.

B0006399FS|5.0|How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is, without question, U2's best work since Achtung Baby. If you like U2 you must have this album in your collection. The energy and exuberance is, frankly, shocking given that the band members are now in their mid 40's. The quality of this work is something you'd expect from a young, hungry band looking to make a name for itself, not a band that has been around for 25 years and, seemingly, said everything we thought it could have possibly ever said.<br /><br />\\"Vertigo\\" is a pile driver of a rock tune. It hits you in the gut like \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", but with a slick pop hook. Bono proves that, at 44, he can still hit high notes. The vocal performance measures up to just about anything Bono's every recorded.<br /><br />\\"Miracle Drug\\" could have ended up on Joshua Tree or The Unforgettable Fire. It's less anthemic than \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" but has a similar flavor; Edge's guitar work draws on that and other late 80's U2 output.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" also harkens back to Joshua Tree. As always, Bono extends a hand to a friend in need. U2 might be the only band that can get away with such sentimentality.<br /><br />\\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is swampy, bluesy and a bit funky. \\"Love and Peace\\" calls to mind the Doors, the Stooges, the Beatles (think: \\"Come Together\\") while sounding unique, original. It starts slow but ends powerfully.<br /><br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" starts unassumingly like U2's quieter pop tunes found on Achtung Baby and Unforgettable Fire, but picks up steam quickly. \\"City\\" might be too familiar, too borrowed. I wouldn't be surprised if it is the next single.<br /><br />\\"All Because of You\\" - a solid up-tempo song with a pinch of (the Who's ) \\"Substitute\\". The guitar work is all Edge but Bono's lyrics might have been ghost-written by a young Pete Townshend.<br /><br />\\"A Man and a Woman\\", like a few of its sister songs, is held together by the bass. Without the fat bottom, the song would be another mid-tempo pseudo love song. A worthy piece but hardly the best on the album.<br /><br />\\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" is another whose tone and attitude seems lifted from The Unforgettable Fire, though it's more rock than many of that album's songs. Lots of Edge's signature chimey riffs give the song a familiar feel. \\"Crumbs\\" is another that is held together by the bass. It's one of the better songs on the album.<br /><br />\\"One Step Closer\\" is sleepy, introspective and spiritual; probably the least complex song of the eleven.<br /><br />\\"Original of the Species\\" - An obvious play on Darwin's \\"Origin of the Species\\", Bono's take is that the lover he's singing about is \\"the first one of your kind\\" and \\"feel like no one before\\".  \\"Original\\" is another mid-to-up-tempo ballad that could be a single or video.<br /><br />\\"Yahweh\\". The ancient Jewish scribes used to wash their hands before and after each time they wrote God's name in the scrolls. This song is part prayer, part poem. Bono's either calling for God's help or trying to be cute, I'm not sure which.  \\"Yahweh\\" adequately concludes the album but, in my humble opinion, should have been sandwiched in the middle of the disc.<br /><br />When a band builds a body of work as deep and as good as U2's, it is harder and harder to improve on its last or greatest material. Besides, what fuels a man's creative fire when he's middle-aged, fat, married and astoundingly rich?<br /><br />To me, it's nothing short of a miracle that U2 could put together an album this good now. Had How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb been released in 1987, the power of it would be more easily explainable, understood. Usually artists aren't allowed to put out \\"classic\\" material past their primes, but How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb might be viewed, in a decade or so, as one of U2's most important works. If the 20-somethings get it<br /><br />-- by that I mean both buy and understand it - it may be viewed as the best album of the new millenium.as the best album of the new millenium. <br />
0790733226|5.0|I originally viewed this at the theater.  Later purchased the DVD.  And view the movie again from time to time.  No other movie is as good to watch repeatedly as this one to me.  <br /> <br />Jodie Foster does an excellent job in the key character of this movie.  And a fine supporting cast do quite well working to make all the events seem plausibly quite real.    <br /> <br />Of the negative reviews I see here, they seem to fall into three categories.  One is people who knew nothing of Carl Sagan's writings.  And think the movie should be juiced up.  One is people who read the book and don't like the changes made. And finally those who don't like the treatment of religion or the manner in which the science seemed at odds with religion as portrayed here.  <br /> <br />If you aren't familiar with Carl Sagan, then you are possibly looking for the wrong thing from this movie.  It isn't a sci-fi thriller meant to mindlessly entertain for a short while.  <br /> <br />If you don't like the changes from the book, well I think that a matter of taste.  I thought the changes didn't diminish too much the ideas from the book.  And some concessions have to be made when books become movies.   <br /> <br />For those not liking the portrayal of science and the way it is sometimes at odds with religion I can only say it must have seemed that way to Carl Sagan.  And I think it often is at odds.  As we advance in science as a culture it will be more at odds in the future.  Some compromises or changes will have to occur.  This movie left that open ended.  As it must do to be honest.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, 5 stars all the way.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I don't know for sure who this Moore guy thinks he is with this \\"documentry,\\" but is pure crap.  He is trying to play this movie off as one of the best of the year, but I'd rather watch Gili a hundred times.  Michael Moore should have stuck to what he knows and done a documentry on eating fast food for every meal.  He would have probably skrewed that up splicing in the same scene of him eating a salad with a cartoon of himself as a physically fit character.  This guy can not influence a dog to vote democratic if he tied a t-bone around John Kerry's neck.  He is unappealing to look at and his views make absolutly no sense.  Any one who buys this film obviously does not know anything that goes on in the world and cannot look at any thing with an objective view and goes along with whatever people tell them to think.  He walks around all day yet does not lose an once of fat I think he has an I.V. full of lard constantly being pumped into him.  I give this movie a horrible review and would wish that this moron not come back ever again.  For all of you that are tired of the media being painted as leanining toward the left do not support this movie.  If you love truth and honesty do not support this movie.  If you do research on issues and try to look at both sides, do not buy it. It is a movie that is made for the idiot America that is made to follow everything they are told.  The only support that this movie got was from the loyal right who were ignited to vote for Bush.  These type of hollywood supporters do not know about middle America and hurt more than they help and it must come to a stop.  Don't buy this movie.
B0006399FS|5.0|There are alot of U2 fans writing reviews that don't really understand the breadth of history involving U2. I guess that makes sense, considering they span over 30 years and have such a disparate canon! I was 10 when Boy came out. I was the Boy walking home from school, under Shadows & Tall Trees. I felt the pull of adolescent ego in A Day Without Me. I smelled Mrs. Brown washing & it was always the same...I knew we could begin again on New Years Day. And so it was, through War and the  mysterious fields and magical spires of Unforgettable Fire. Only to be awoken at 20 with the brilliance of Achtung, to the dirty subways and the dark alleys of the Post Modern World.  <br />     Where do we go from here? ATYCLB may have brought all the praise the band deserved, but for me, it was a lowering of expectations. It was nice to see U2 getting the credit, but...was U2 through walking me through the Twilight?  <br />   The Bomb took me by complete suprise. WoW! U2 have once again created an impossibly great album. It's in the intangibles. It's between the lines, it's in the shadow where Boy meets Man. It's Lillywhite. It's U2, produced but not over-produced. It's impossibly great, from an impossibly great band. You WILL place the Bomb with the other great U2 albums. The backlash will subside. U2 have proved that it is possible to beat all the odds. The possibilities seem endless, with Reason on our side.
B00006CXSS|5.0|True to the book and true to the men who lived and died to defeat true evil.<br /><br />Talk about \\"Heroes\\" - the most overused, misused term in our language... These guys were the real deal.<br /><br />Spielberg and Hanks put together an absolutely top quality series that is worth watching more than once. INMHO, better than Private Ryan or for that matter - any war movie, period.  There are some difficult and gruesome things to watch - be warned.  But in context - it is appropriate to tell the true story.<br /><br />After seeing it - I had to get the book. Very inspiring.  (Loaned DVD's to my Dad - who loved it as well...)<br /><br />Thanks HBO!
B00002DCXM|1.0|Excellent album, in my opinion. <br />Before i'm going to judge it there is one point to remember:    the band lost a basic member like Kay Hansen, one of the fathers of the entire speed-power metal movement. <br />His replacement, Roland Grapow, was an excellent guitarist, singer and composer but the magic that had Hellowen with Kay was gone. <br />Plus it wasn't the easiest thing to create something better than the giant-Keeper albums. <br />Anyway the album has a superb melodic feel and the sound is clear and better than the past albums (especially the drums). <br />'Pink Bubbles' is an honest melodic metal album with a couple of great songs like 'Someone's Crying' (great Grapow a la Malmsteen on this one), 'Your Turn', 'Number One' and 'Back in the Streets'. <br />There is place for two masterpieces too:    'Mankind' (with a superb guitar work again) and 'The Chance', probably two of the best Helloween's tracks of all times. <br />Michael Kiske shines as always with an excellent performance.  His singing is probably deeper than the past albums and he proves his endless skill once again. <br />The bass lines of Markus are alays powerful and solid as Weiki and Ingo do their honest job (Ingo's best performances are on the albums before this one). <br />I saw the band live in Italy for the tour and they were excellent. <br />Since this album Roland Grapow became much important year by year, showing his true talent. <br />I recommend this album to Helloween's fans and not, that's not on the Keeper standards but the quality is high and 'Mankind' and 'The Chance' are masterpieces,as i said.    Buy it! <br /> <br />
B0000931QR|5.0|La Oreja de Van Gogh is a spanish music wonder. Amaia's voice is so sweet. Every single song in the album is great. I like Geografia a lot.
0312995423|1.0|Forget about the fact that the author knows nothing about computers, programming or cryptography. This is often the case in popular literature. What makes the book really droll is its ineptitude in addressing much more basic issues, such as: <br /> <br />The author believes Spain is a backwards country. The swipes at Spain provide some of the most enterteining bits in the book. Here are just two of the many: \\"Getting an international connection from Spain was like roulette, all a matter of timing and luck\\". And \\"A punctured lung was fatal, maybe not in more medically advanced parts of the world, but in Spain, it was fatal.\\" <br /> <br />The author believes oxygen is released during combustion: \\"She sensed [the fire] rising faster and faster, feeding on the oxygen released by the burning [computer] chips.\\" <br /> <br />Basic confusion about measurments is obvious in the description of a 'vast' underground facility: \\"Susan stared as the dazzling facility. She vaguely remembered that 250 metric tons of earth had been excavated to create it.\\" This would correspond to less than a 5x10x5 meters hole. Was the NSA headquarters located in somebody's basement? <br /> <br />But funnier still is the clumsy writing: <br /> <br />Brown is tone-deaf when it comes to the musicality of the language. A collision is described as a \\"bone-crushing crash\\".  <br /> <br />Hackers breaking into a system elicit one of the many inane similes employed by Brown: \\"Jabba spun toward the [monitor]. Two thin lines had appeared outside the concentric circles. They looked like sperm trying to breach a reluctant egg.\\" <br /> <br />The main character makes a toe-curling reference to a night of passionate love, to her fiancee: \\"Susan smiled coyly. 'Any more interesting than last night and I'll never walk again.'\\" <br /> <br />In the middle of a chase scene Becker runs into the Seville cathedral. A brief description of the cathedral is given, which seems lifted from a local travel brochure, ending in thedelicious \\"To the left and right of the altar, the transept of the cross houses confessionals, sacred tombs, and additional seating.\\" Additional seating!  <br /> <br />My real questions are how can such garbage get published, and who is Nelson DeMille who proclaims, on the cover, Dan Brown to be 'pure genius' and 'the most accomplished writer in the country'. What country? Spain, perhaps?
B0006399FS|2.0|The fact that there are so many mixed reviews of this album says it all.  This is \\"supposed\\" to be the U2 that returns to it's rock roots.  Rather, it's just a another bland over-produced mediocre output that they've become so proficient at making over the last decade plus.  Most of the songs sound as if any average band could put them out.  This is the great U2?? <br />    Sure, there are a few songs that will hold you for a little while.  But, compared to U2 in their hay-day these songs are merely \\"fillers\\".  Clearly, U2 ran out of ideas and energy a long time ago (See their last 3-4 albums for evidence). <br />    It's sad, when you really think about it.  They're living off their past and a HUGE marketing budget.  That's it.   Btw, I really really wanted to like this album.  But, like the last few, it just wasn't feasible to do so if you have a frame of reference for what this band \\"used to\\" be.   Sad....
B00009XITR|5.0|WOW WOW WOW!!! Amanda Bynes is one little cutie!!!!   Ooogie Boooga!!!! AY AY AY AY AY!!!!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I bought seasons 1 & 2 the day they came out.  The packaging and graphics is great, one of the best I've seen.  The box also contains exact details on what is featured on each dvd, which is great.  It's a little strange watching the episodes without all the laugh tracks added, but the high def remake is wonderful.  I would have liked to have seen bloopers & outtakes included for EACH episode, not just a few of them on one of the dvd's.  But overall, it's a great set, and I'm going back tomorrow to buy Season 3!
B000148KK2|5.0|This girl can go back to the other room.  This music is nothing but \\"watered down\\", bubble gum pop muzac.  Krall sounds like a fish out of water doing alternitive style music.  Her voice soudns most appealing when recording retro jazz, and broadway style standards, in a swingin', emotionless, cool dewad serious Julie London cum Shirley Horn style.  This music in so un-timeless, and Krall's pinao abilites are wasted here.  Krall shouldn't do the \\"Norah Jones\\" thing.  Krall should keep on doing the Carmen McRae/Shirley Horn thing.  This is her only disasterous cd, so hopefully she'll stop plugging her hubby's songs and go back to real music.
0345448898|5.0|This series is wonderful. It is set in a world not unlike our world. The theories behind the book's story are based in science. There are some fasinating thoughts on religion in this book if you think hard enough to realize they are there.   <br /> <br />The end of the book is a bit sad. It made me want to cry. I do think it was worth reading. I did enjoy it overall. I recomend it to all of my friends. If you liked Harry Potter but wanted something stronger you must get this book. If you like Lemony Snicket but wanted something older like then this is your book.  <br /> <br />This book is geared more towards the older child. The story is a bit strong. There are scary parts and sad parts. This is one of the things that makes it good. It also makes it something you would not want your seven year old to attempt to read.  <br /> <br />The way the story is written makes the words melt on your mouth. The details in the plot make your mind run. It will give you something to discuss for hours with another who has read it. I would recomend it for a book club that has open minded members willing to discuss it throughly.
B0006399FS|5.0|If you don't want get disappointed, don't expect the wrong thing. Yes, it's a problem because you can't know what the expectation should be. I believe nearly all these bad reviews are a consequence of this. For me, this album sounds like Achtung Baby, not like the Joshua Tree as it might be expected. And it's really a GREAT album. Let you expectations apart and just try to listen to these songs. If you can feel this, you will recognize a masterpiece. These songs are better for the soul than the body.
B0000057C5|5.0|I liked this cd a lot. It combines techno/rock/metal into every song and the vocals are great. If you already have Mutter and expect to hear the same kind of music as you did in Mutter, your not. They use lots more keyboard music in this cd then they did in Mutter. The keyboard actually sounds awesome in almost every song. The guitar is heavy at most points throughout the whole cd. Vocals are just insane. I have never heard anything like it. Beware that every song is sung in German(if your new to the band). I didn't really concentrate on the drumming a lot. It was good but nothing special. <br /> <br />RATINGS: <br />1. Sehnsucht-10/10 <br />2. Engel-10/10 <br />3. Tier-10/10 <br />4. Bestrafe Mich-10/10 <br />5. Du Hast-10/10 <br />6. Buck Dich-10/10 <br />7. Spiel Mit Mir-10/10 <br />8.Klavier-9/10  <br />9.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|Whatever I might want to say has already been well said here by others.  I just wanted to add, given recent and current events, this disc has, very possibly, kept me from throwing myself in front of a bus.  Sweet, in every sense of the word.
B0006399FS|5.0|The more the u2 naysayers bring down this album and the more people don't buy this great CD, the more closer I can get tickets to the stage at the next u2 tour.  They are the greatest live band ever, have the biggest fanbase in the world HANDS DOWN, and this album will sell millions.  That must really kill some of the people posting these bad reviews? Now that's a laugh. <br /> <br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb: My grade for this album is a 'B', although it might go up after more listens.  I've only heard the whole thing twice.  It's quite amazing but not nearly their best work.  I think the fair rating would be 4/5, but I'll give it 5 to balance out these horrible 1-stars the album is getting from people who probably haven't heard all of it.
B00008VGK0|5.0|Madonna's anti-war song, American Life, is a wonderful song and the cd single is a great acommpy to the song.  <br /> <br />1. Missy Elliott's American Dream Mix: The weakest of all the remixes. This remix is okay, but Missy Elliott's beats may work for her songs, but not Madonna's.  <br /> <br />2. Oakenfold Downtempo Remix: The best remix here. This version keeps the orginal version, but adds some electronica sound to it.  <br /> <br />3. Felix Da HouseCat's Devin Dazzle Club Mix: This a good remix of the song, but the song it sped up way too much. <br /> <br />4. Paul Oakenfold American Anthem Part 1: This is another good remix. It is by Paul Oakenfold, so you can't go wrong. It has an electronic feel to it and clocks in at over 10mis. <br /> <br />5. Paul Oakenfold American Anthem Part 2: This version is better than part 1. It always stays hot and never gets boring.  <br /> <br />6. Die Another Day (Richard Humpty Vission Electrofield Mix): I dont' like this remix of Die Another Day, it is too slow and boring. The mixes on the Die Another Day maxi are better.
B0006399FS|1.0|Once upon a time, you could count on U2 to give you 6 or 7 decent tracks on a new cd or record, 3 of which were brilliant, and 1 that amounted to a timeless gem (for example, \\"New Year's Day,\\" \\"Bad,\\" \\"One Tree Hill,\\" or \\"One\\").  On this new cd, you can count zero gems, nothing brilliant, and 2 decent tracks (\\"Vertigo,\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" if you can overlook the Jesus reference).  A pattern has emerged: ATYCLB and HTDAAB demonstrate the lack of (and need for) propulsive bass lines and strong vocals (which Bono seems to have lost forever). Sadly, the Edge's reemergence on HTDAAB (after having gone missing on ATYCLB) isn't enough to merit repeat listening of the new cd.  And so HTDAAB provides little reward for the waiting.
B000687M48|5.0|this dvd is a masterpiece , a fantastic live concert including some of evanescence best songs to date - my immortal, whisper, breath no more, going under and thoughtless (korn cover) - which makes this a perfect setlist. Apart from people saying missing is a old sog (and I konw it) it still sounds great and it's a good compliment to the cd. The dvd also includes their 4 videoclips , which I find all amazing especially \\"everybody's fool\\" one of the most critical and well made videoclips of the actual music industry. The behind the scenes is just awesome ,you can see scenes like amy lee in a prom pink dress , or playing a acoustic song!!! worth buying
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has made an absolutly incredibly album.  She brings together Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, R&B, and Soul all into one phenomial album.  She got some help with it though... she has some great guests on this album.  Dave Navarro; fighter, Lil Kim; Cant Hold Us Down, Dirrty; RedMan, Impossible; Alicia Keys. <br />A wonderfull album, that deservs major props.  Way to go Christina! <br />
B000002JPA|5.0|This is in response to M. C Wright \\"bad boy for life\\"'s review of Images and Words. Do not let his ranting influence your thoughts on this cd because HE WAS LISTENING TO A DIFFERENT CD! MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT CD YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! And once he finds out that he was really listening to \\"Metropolis pt2: Scenes from a memory\\", he should know that his hilarious song is part of a concept album, meaning the song is not meant to stand on it's own persay, but rather is serving a purpose in a much larger entity, assuming he has th attention span to listen to a whole concept album front to back. It should be known that IMAGES AND WORDS, which, contrary to popular belief, is NOT Metropolis pt 2, and as such, regardless of whether the song in question is lame or not, does not have the so-called lame song on it. I think both are world-class cd's, demonstrating true musicianship so lacking in our crap-infused world
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I'm sick of seeing all of these reviews referencing 5 or so other bands/artists...  the girl singer sounds like bjork? what? she's a melodic female singer with a girlish voice.  and she's good...but not bjork.  this truly is a great album but it's not because they sound like other people, they are great because they are original and have created something powerful.  if there are any comparisons to be drawn i would say it is loosely to the Pixies because of the male/female vocal contrasts, the range of emotion, the mystery, and the unique style.  They are the sound of a generation bursting with creative energy and talent.
B0006399FS|3.0|the new album reflect more of the pop-zooropia sound of the late 90 <br /> <br />it is not an album i would listen to more than once accept for vertigo an excellent u2 song. the last u2 album was a 5 this is a 3 at best, music sounds like background elevator music, with bits of edge guitar thrown in, too many lyric not enough catchy music <br /> <br />buy all that you cant leave behind instead, u2 best of the last 10 years or so
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This DVD is by far the most stunning electric guitar show ever. Sure people can find shortcomings and I live in Australia so I wasn't there. But this DVD is a magnificent experience. Eric is back in fine form after his supressed mix in the John Mayall 70th Birthday concert. His \\"Blues In C\\" is his best playing in years, he is inspired as would any guitarist be after this show. I bought two copies because I knew it would be great.<br /><br />Highlights:  All blues songs-especially Hubert Sumlin. Plays as he did with Howlin Wolf-same style.<br /><br />  Buddy Guy is his best in years also. He is 70<br /><br />  B.B. is superb- He is 80<br /><br />  Robert Cray- \\"Time Make Two\\" is perhaps the best perfromance on the DVD.<br /><br />  Eric Johnson-Plays a great pop-style song with a Jimi Hendrix set up.<br /><br />  Booker T and the MGs with David Hildago and Joe Walsh is a highlight. Walsh acts as drugged out as ever, but his blues licks a la Albert King's \\"Drowing On Dry Land\\" are cool.<br /><br />  John McLaughlin is great. His tribute to Jazz drummer Elvin Jones who just died this year is moving and he uses just himself and two drummers; one western and one eastern (tabla) as accompaniment. Fantastic!<br /><br />  Eric Clapton's various collaborations are all superb. He plays well with Doyle Bramhall II, whose father played with Stevie Ray and others is great and Doyle plays Albert King style, left-handed and upside down! And plays a good chord backing, too!<br /><br />  This is well produced, good sound, good photography except all the crowd shots are young women enjoying the event!! And a great selection of tunes. Jeff Beck should have been included as should have Otis Rush, Mick Taylor and maybe Peter Green, but get this, it is great!!!!
B000002HMH|4.0|OK so this isnt exactly Kill Em All but theres some good stuff on here. Aint My Bitch and 2x4 are pretty good. King Nothing is a great track and so is Outlaw Torn.The<br />rest of it is sorta take it or leave it kinda stuff.The problem<br />with this album is Hero of The Day and Untill It Sleeps. This is Metallica at their very worst- bowing to the gods of shlop.<br />And if you're Metallica , the greatest metal band of all time ( in their minds anyway ) you CAN NOT , under any circumstances  do a song called  \\" mama said \\".
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|I had major doubts about this album after reading reviews from other customers, but I went ahead and bought it anyway. Intitially, I wasn't all that impressed with it - I deemed it rather boring and dreary. However, after listening to the songs more, I have grown to like it a lot more and enjoy the songs more so than I did at first. <br /> <br />Most of the songs could be described as 'boring', but they are supposed to be soothing lullabies, which is what they come across as after a few listens. The songs aren't comparable to her old material, 'Miracle' cannot stand up to 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now', but they are very pleasant songs to listen to. <br /> <br />In response to people saying Cline is selling out... who doesn't? There are a lot of entertainers who have lent their voices and faces to products and collabarated with designers and other entertainers to create something special - which is precisely what this album is. It's not going to suit the teenage market, (although I enjoy it and I'm 16), but I'm sure it will please mothers who can relate to the songs more than the average listener could.
B000003TA4|2.0|Actually 2 1/2 stars . Drain is pretty good , so is the song Polly . Lounge act is awesome . Most of this album is a power pop album - not all that much different then the hair band nightmare it vanquished . The differences being Cobain is a brooder , hence the silly lyrics .... the other difference - the musicianship is mediocre ( and that's being kind ) .The best guitar player in the band is behind the drum kit ... go figure . This is at the core of Nirvanas legacy . They made it acceptable ..and fashionable to be mediocre. The music industry finds itself in a bit of a quandry these days . Why ? Because no one knows how to play beyond the beginner level . Why ? Because the critics can't cope with anything too complex . With the level of undesereved hype and praise associated with this album you can expect more of the same and untill things change , the \\" genius \\"  of Kurt Cobain will linger ...like one of his brooding songs .
B000002UA2|3.0|I have owned this album for quite some time, but what makes me write a review on it is having recently obtained the movie for which this music was made for, La Valle - or Obscured by clouds. <br /> <br />By no means is this one of my favorite Floyd records but it is one of the most subtle and beautiful.  It doesn t have the greatness of Piper, or the sheer genius of A Saucerful of secrets.  Nonetheless it makes for an appropriate collection of songs to accompany the 1972 Barbet Schroeder movie. <br /> <br />I highly recommend the movie. <br /> <br />Additionally Floyd created some noteworthy compositions here.  The only awful, and I mean awful moment of the record is Free four.  It is the absolutely worst composition Floyd ever did.  Steer clear of that song. <br /> <br />Purchase the album, then get the movie.  The movie is for very exigent fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000AOUD|5.0|Thick as a Brick is why Jethro Tull is one of the coolest bands in rock and roll. After the success of Aqualung ,Ian Anderson, instead of trying make a duplicate,does a complete 360 and comes up with Thick. This album isn't perfect by any means - its got some filler here and there but its strength is the lyrics, which<br /><br />hold your interest throughout the entire 43:44 minutes of the<br /><br />album.The musicianship is tight. Martin Barre is his usual self and John Evans keys are very prominent thoughout the piece. For some reason I love fact that Tull never really gets any credit for anything they do . I also like the fact that theyre not even considered for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame while bands like the the Clash, the Ramones and Tom Petty ( all of whom I like, particularly the Ramones) are in. None of these bands , in thier wildest dreams could come up with anything close to Thick and the<br /><br />critics cream over them. Thats what makes Jethro Tull, in my opinion , the coolest band in rock  and roll.
B00005JMAH|1.0|I don't usually write reviews, however after my 8 year old daughter and I sat thought three quarters of this un-inspidered insult to the first two movies, I just had to say something. <br /> <br />Director Chris Columbus rose to the challenge and succeeded in creating visually original and entertaining magical fantasy world that had pace and mixed an essential plot balance of mystique, adventure, surpise, horror, drama and comedic relief. The character performances where strong with notable performances by the late great Richard Harris. Appart from the a little too graphically scary element of the first movie, both movies are all-in-all good family entertainment. <br /> <br />Harry Potter III has none of the qualities of the first two movies. The first noticed was this movie was more like Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow', very dark with no sense of fun. Warner Bros have a new Director on III which shows!. The new Director seems to lack basic schooling in movie-making as he shoots lengthy scenes mainly in long-shot, evidently either too lazy or just lacks grounding in how to make a paced movie. This movie as a result is slow bordering boring. There are no endearing qualities. The movie lacks humor, the actors look as though they are not having fun making this one. The screenplay is confusing, I still don't know what the plot is. There are too many horror elements in this movie, Warner Bros should remember this franchise is supposed to entertain elementary school girls too. My 8 year old daughter hid her eyes most of the time and asked me to turn it off after and hour. We certainly won't be filling our Christmas stockings with Potter merchandise this year. <br />  <br />Evidently this movie was thown together quickly to fill a gap and line purses before the next three. Unless Director Chris Columbus or even Joe Johnston came on board for the next movie, I for one won't be bothering.. I would like to have my money back on this poor excuse for filmmaking. <br />
B0000041WV|5.0|I agree with Bob Zeidler that the music is terrific.  I am not a musicologist, so my review is just about what I hear from the heart.  Not knowing Dvorak's first five symphonies, I have nothing to compare them with.  But who cares, they have been a pleasant surprise.  Symphonies #'s 6, 7 & 8 are wonderful.  However, I have a cassette (I used to have the record) of the 9th with Rafael Kubelik and The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in a recording made in the late 1950's or early '60's.  I adore that recording better than anyone else's.  Maybe it's because it's the first recording I heard of the 9th and I can't find any recording that I like better.  However, 8 out of 9 ain't bad, and I do LIKE the 9th by Kertesz. <br /> <br />On that note, I've been replacing my old records with the same exact recordings on CD.  Do I detect a trend here? <br /> <br />I agree with Bob about the sidebreaks where Symphony #2 is split between discs 1 & 2 and Symphony #5 is split between discs 3 & 4, which can be very annoying.  The distribution of the overtures could have been spread out more evenly and perhaps the addition of the \\"Hussite Overture\\" (and others if available) could have been added, but you don't need an extra CD to do that.  If the set ever sells out, perhaps the people who make London CD's could redistribute the 6 CD set (AND IT SHOULD NEVER GO OUT OF PRINT) by making a few small changes.  Symphonies #'s 1 & 2 could be placed on CD's #'s 1 & 2, respectivly with an overture or two coupled with each.  Symphonies #'s 3 & 9, could be on CD #3, Symphonies #'s 4 & 8 on CD # 4 and Symphonies #'s 5 & 7 on CD #5.  That leaves Symphony # 6 with perhaps The Hussite Overture (and another Dvorak piece by Kertesz if time allows).  Still, the same number of CD's would be needed, only their distribution would be more even and, in my opinion, more satisfying.
B00065JTBA|5.0|20 years of great Rock & Roll. Everybody knows the Bon Jovi classics: Livin' On A Prayer, You Give Love A Bad Name, It's My Life, Bed Of Roses and so on. Great tunes, which many can relate to. I'm one of those people and I've been a fan for 7 years now, since I'm only 20 years old. My view is that Bon Jovi are too much known only of those classic tunes and that they are highly underestimated for their other songs, on every album. This BoxSet proves that Bon Jovi is THE best band in the world! The songs on this Boxset should be the leftovers. They didn't make the albums, they didn't make the b-sides, they were previously unreleased. So Bon Jovi fans expected nice songs, but not excellent and beautiful songs. Every fan was blown away by theis BoxSet. Even the critics, who always negatively critisised Bon Jovi for almost everything they did, must be positive about this marvelous collection of great masterpieces by the best band in the world! Even for non-Bon Jovi fans this collection of songs, is a must-have..!
B00012BD0S|5.0|I am blown away by the virtuosity of each individual member of the group, absolutely stunning. This is a must buy, I can sit through the entire CD.
B000002AH1|4.0|Live Evil is a little strange; unlike the other electric Miles releases of the 70s it combines studio and live recordings -- occasionally on the same track!  About 80% of the music (tracks 1 and 4 on the first disc, 2 and 3 on the second disc) comes from a December 1970 engagement at the Cellar Door Club in DC.  The other 20% comes from various studio recordings. <br /> <br />I'm personally of the opinion that, with a few important exceptions, Miles's studio recordings post-BB are pretty unsatisfying.  The short ambient tracks (\\"Little Church\\", \\"Nem Um Talvez\\" and \\"Selim\\") are little more than filler.  \\"Double Image\\" has more to offer, but doesn't offer much aside from some fine, screaming John McLaughlin guitar. <br /> <br />The meat of the album lies in the live material.  The band here is Miles on trumpet, Gary Bartz on saxophones, Keith Jarrett on organ and electric piano, Michael Henderson on electric bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, Airto on percussion, and special-guest-for-this-evening-only John McLaughlin.  Jarrett is on record complaining that McLaughin threw the group off its groove.  I don't hear it.  DeJohnette and Henderson lock into some ridiculously funky backbeats (particularly on \\"What I Say\\" and the first 4 minutes of \\"Sivad\\"), and Jarrett is more than happy to play his characteristic mix of gospelly rollicking and abstract weirdness.  Near the end of the first medley on disc 2, acoustic purist Jarrett plays a beautiful solo improvisation on organ and electric piano.  McLaughlin is as good as you'd expect for this period -- just months before his Mahavishnu Orchestra debuted on record, laying down some crunchy, heavy guitar.  Gary Bartz was one of Miles's best saxophonists post-Wayne Shorter (he plays both alto and soprano here).  And as for the Dark Magus himself: he plays both regular and wah-wah trumpet, but his chops are still at a very high level unlike some later electric recordings. <br /> <br />Like a lot of live recordings, there are moments when the music loses focus.  Nevertheless, the live portions of this disc easily justify the purchase.  It straddles the divide between his earlier, jazzier electric recordings and the guitar-based funk of the mid-70s: a good third stop after you've checked out Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way.
B0002F6BRE|1.0|I've seen some bad ones in my time, but this is stupid! All the movie is is a sheltered, immature elf-raised guy getting himself into trouble, and sometimes not getting out of it! Add in the gross parts (M&M's and syrup on pasta) and you have the total waste of time and money that this is!
0312319517|3.0|Rating System:<br /><br />1 star = abysmal; some books deserve to be forgotten<br /><br />2 star = poor; a total waste of time<br /><br />3 star = good; worth the effort<br /><br />4 star = very good; what writing should be<br /><br />5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others<br /><br />STORY: Mercenary, Cal Dexter, is hired to track down a notorious criminal while dodging the CIA, foreign governments and the bad guys own army<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />CONTENT - Graphic on the violence that left me feeling uneasy for the fact that the portrayals seemed to truly capture Evil. This made for us hating the bad guy more, but it was a bit too much information<br /><br />CHARACTERS - Pages are given to the backgrounds of characters in an attempt to provide depth, but came across as an information dump at times. Good guy is likeable, bad guy is detestable, and those in-between play their necessary roles. It all works and in the end we do want to see more of Cal, which is a good thing<br /><br />SETTING - Modern day, making use of recent historical facts, the setting plays its part. The bad guy's hold-out was a bit unbelievable, but the explanations leave it semi-satisfactorily acceptable<br /><br />PLOT - At first I couldn't figure out where the story was headed and how events and characters were connected. Yet, through a complicated but well described process all parties come together to play their part. Nice ending too boot.<br /><br />OVERALL - Good story, which is a good thing since this is my first experience with Mr. Forsyth's writing. If it wasn't for the overly graphic violence and the character information dumps, I would have rated this higher. Still worth a read/listen
B00007K08H|5.0|It is really hard to give the reader a sense of this magical film because it is almost beyond words.  There have been many films (foreign and non) made about misfits who live their lives outside of the box, but few have been orchestrated with such whimsy, subtlety and warmth as was done with \\"Amelie.\\"<br /><br />Amelie (Audrey Tatou) is a young waitress at a cafe, who lives a solitary existence in Paris, and we get a sense from the very beginning that she has spent her life on the outside looking in.  She has a lively and individualistic imagination.  A chance discovery of a mysterious childhood toy box and her determination to return it to the original owner, inspires her to make bringing joy and redemption to others her life's work.  It isn't until she comes face-to-face with a potential suitor (Nino--played by Mathieu Kassovitz) that the shy waif must look to find her own true bliss.<br /><br />One of the strogest qualities of this film is the magical and intriguing combination of magical realism (talking pictures of animals, the juxtaposition of Amelie's fantasies and how she applies them to reality) and warm sprinkles of exhuberant humor.  This is also a film with a great heart.  It is truly a shining example of an adult fairy tale where destiny can be determined by timing and courage.  Please don't avoid seeing this because of the subtitles, either.  Yes, it is in French, but I guarantee that this film is so entertaining you will forget you are reading them!
B00005YUAC|5.0|This LP was not originally released in the US and was only avaible as an import.  A CD version was released in the US.  Now, there is this remastered version, with 2 extra songs.  The original CD was about 39 minutes long.  This new version is 63 minutes. <br /> <br />This is one of Camel's three best albums.   They play progressive rock, but with the emphasis on rock.  The music is a little rough in places, having a garage band quality.  But, it gives the music a very nice edge.  Every track is energetic and interesting.  There is not a bad track on the album. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are a 3 minute single edit of Never Let Go (which is worthless, in my opinion) and a 19 minute live number called Homage to the God of Light.  This is a piece that Camel used to always play in concert in the early days.  It is a rambling jam.  It reminds of the early jams Deep Purple used to do (Wring That Neck or Mandrake Root).   <br /> <br />From this point on, Camel's music would slowly get softer and softer until they started playing New Age Jazz in the eighties.  In the nineties, some of the spark would return. <br /> <br />After Camel's fourth album, the band slowly broke apart, with one member leaving after each album, until only guitarist Andy Lattimer was left.  He eventually moved the band to California. <br /> <br />Pete Bardens went on a solo career, playing mostly New Age type music.  He did a guest appearance on Camel's live album, Pressure Points.  He formed a band called Mirage, which featured members of Caravan and Camel's old drummer.  They toured playing Camel and Caravan songs.  He then reformed Mirage with 3 studio musicians and but out a lack luster live album.  He died in 2003.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am giving it 5 stars.  Classic 80's U2.  Bono has never sounded better.  The songs are all fantastic(I even like Vertigo)  I have listened to it nonstop since I got it Tuesday.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|Of all the John Hughes films I have seen \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is probably my least favorite but only because I have seen this movie so many times on basic cable on Saturday mornings. Nevertheless the movie isn't bad as I make it out to sound. I grew up in the '80s and on John Hughes' films. I thought his coming of age teenage flicks like \\"Pretty in Pink\\", \\"Sixteen Candles\\", and \\"The Breakfast Club\\" at the time represented the lives of teenagers. That was almost twenty years ago and teenagers today are more angst-ridden and are dealing with a lot more serious problems. There really isn't much of plot in \\"The Breakfast Club\\". It simply revolves around a circle of high school students who end up getting detention and are forced to serve it on a Saturday morning. There is the jock Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), the rebel John Bender (Judd Nelson), popular girl Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the outcast Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), and the geek Brian Ralph Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall). Principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) has his students in the library which forces them to talk to each other. Although it appears that they are different, the five students eventually realize that they really are not all that different despite the fact they come from different backgrounds and hang out with different crews. My favorite moment in the film were the more dramatic scenes when each character are forced to evaluate themselves. I also liked it when everyone tries to escape the library and get out of detention. Paul Gleason as principal Richard Vernon was the ideal antagonist for the five lead characters. He was pretty funny. Although I have seen this movie so many times and am pretty tired of it, I still like \\"The Breakfast Club\\".
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Just about everyone's comments have done justice for Nightwish, however, I feel compelled to write the first things that came to mind after listening to ONCE.  I feel that Tarja had truly discovered the sound that she and the band was looking for when they produced Century Child which is a great work.  The album ONCE, however, simply shows that the band has discovered the formula because they stuck with it.  Marco has a good voice for metal and compliments Tarja's less operatic sound very well this way.  I think Nightwish are definitly dialed in, and have a strong future ahead of them depending more on the choices Tarja makes in her musical career.
B000069HPL|5.0|When \\"Office Space\\" first came out, I have to admit that the movie did not look very good. The trailers didn't do the movie justice. I didn't see the movie until this past year and that was when I started to appreciate this movie. I work for a huge mortgage company which basically I would not recommend taking out a loan with given the way they treat their customers which is horrible, not to mention their employees too. What I see in \\"Office Space\\" is basically a mirror image of the BS I have to suffer at the office on a daily basis. Mike Judge (creator of \\"Beavis and Butthead\\") really captures cubical life in \\"Office Space\\". Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter Gibbons who begins out in the movie stressing out about everything that is going on at his job but after he is hypnotized (which eventually goes awry), Peter stops giving a darn about his job and starts slouching off. Yet that lazy, sloth mentality of Peter's manages to get him far ahead in the company while other people are being screwed over by the company (which I can definitely relate to). Gary Cole is hilarious as the patronizing, condescending jerk of a boss. His line deliveries cracks me up because they come off sounding pleasant yet the message is not so nice, like coming into the office on the weekends. That I can also relate at my job to which scares me. Stephen Root as Milton was even more hysterical. If anything should be learned from Milton is that be careful of who you push around because you never know what could happen. LOL! I love the pieces of flare that Jennifer Aniston has to wear at a TGI-like restaurant. I cracked up when her boss implied that good employees wears lots of pieces of flare (which are basically cheesy buttons). My most personal favorite moment in the film is the Michael Bolton character who immediately snaps at his cubical neighbor and refers to the pop singer of the same name as \\"a no-talent @$$ clown\\". I love \\"Office Space\\". Anyone who works for a corporation should really watch this movie. You will find this movie bearing a strong resemblence to your job. I know it does for me.y watch this movie. You will find this movie bearing a strong resemblence to your job. I know it does for me.
B00005REQR|5.0|Strong statement to start a review I know, but here are the reasons. Both Daevid and George held large groups of disparate and talented musicians together for several years, gave them alternative names, and got them to buy into their own unique vision of the world. Both visions included fictitous characters acting out complex plots using a unique language and imagery. Both created music that broke down barriers between established musical forms and molded the pieces into something new and undefinable. Both are very funny men (in more ways than one you could say). <br /> <br />Flying Teapot is part one of the Radio Gnome trilogy of albums (Angel's Egg and You are the others).This is the album that introduces us to Zero the Hero and the Pothead Pixies and includes stories of inner/outer space travel in flying teapots and encounters with wicked witches. With only a handful of very long tracks you need to sit down and get involved for the first couple of runs through, but after a while Steve Hillage's guitar and Blomdido Bad de Grasse's sax will hook you into the hypnotic mantras of \\"Zero the Hero\\", \\"The Pothead Pixies\\" and \\"Flying Teapot\\". After that all resistance will be futile and you'll find yourself chanting \\"I am, you are, we are crazy\\" along with everyone else. There are only a couple of weaknesses with the whole thing, but of the trilogy, this is the most straight ahead and rock based. Start here and work through Angel's Egg in to You. It could change the way you look at, well, everything really. <br /> <br />
B00005LOUP|2.0|You can't expect a Jim Carrey movie to not have a few crudities in it, and \\"Grinch\\" is no exception.  These could have been borne had the rest of the movie, which is far too long for so wispy a plot, been engaging. <br /> <br />Carrey's Grinch is forced to carry the show, which he attempts through non-stop hypermanic activity and shouting.  His frenetic pace and commentary are initially tolerable and Carrey's range of expression is remarkable considering the goop on his face.  His own malleable face shines through.  But after a while the viewer is left feeling he's locked in a room with a revved up perpetual motion tyke. <br /> <br />Somehow the cartoon Grinch's change of heart works, but the movie's version doesn't.  He's just too nasty (with an embittered memory of scorn from his childhood) and cynical to change that quickly.  The change is even harder to understand given that nearly all the residents of Whoville are greedy, materialistic oafs who also have an inexplicable change of heart on Christmas day.  The Grinch should have been more puzzled than moved by the sudden shift in Whoville's hedonistic bent. <br /> <br />Stick with the original cartoon Grinch.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|\\"Elf\\" is a great holiday flick; along with such goofy classics as \\"A Christmas Story\\" and \\"Christmas Vacation,\\" watching this movie will definitely become a yearly ritual.  Lots of folks going on about how good (or bad) all the actors, writers, etc. were...I really don't care with stuff like this.  Taken as a single event, \\"Elf\\" is probably a waste of celluloid.  On the other hand, I'm not watching to learn anything particularly new about the human condition; I'm watching to be entertained, and to \\"get in the spirit\\" (if you will).   <br /> <br />No, what I really want to know is this:  are there or are there NOT scenes missing from the film that were in the theatrical release?  I've not seen any other review bring this up, which makes me think I'm just making it up...but, both my partner and I are CERTAIN there was an extended scene in which Jovie explains to Buddy her reasons for disliking Christmas, and that in turn makes her decision to start the singing in Central Park all the more \\"touching.\\"  It's NOT just because she \\"won't sing in public.\\"  However, since I can't find what I'm looking for under any of the special features, I'm wondering if I'm REALLY watching a DVD that, for the first time in the media's history, offers LESS than the theatrical release.  Hope someone out there can confirm what I'm talking about.  Happy holidays!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|WWE at it's finest, definitely the best PPV of 2004, Madison Square Garden, the original home of this classic event, 20,000 people in that arena, it kicked off well, John Cena vs The Big Show, great match, a little lacking in some areas but good, some predictable matches like Undertaker and Kane (i'm a little disapointed with the Undertakers outfit), Main event, the Triple Threat Match, there was only one minor problem with this match, if you watch closely when Shawn is fighting Chris Benoit, you can see Shawns holding a razor, small but you can tell he's holding it, and when Benoit catapults him into the post, you see him literally cut his head, but i think he cut a little too much, because he was bleeding terribly, i didn't notice this until i put it in slow motion (i like watching some of the painful moves in slow motion, gives it much more flare), it's nice to see how they do it. Overall great ppv, definite must see for any wrestling fan.
0786915749|3.0|First, the good points.  The book is fast-paced, has lots of action, and tells an interesting story.  So what's to complain about?  In a word: style.  The pace is fast, but with the speed of the action comes a shallowness, a lack of introspective depth that leaves the mature reader dissatisfied in much the same way that The Hardy Boys series might.  What's great when you're eight isn't as fine when you're thirty-nine.<br /><br />Whether conveying consolation or conviviance, the dialog is often platitudinous.  The authors could have spent a little more time creating dialog that proved that the characters were capable of original and ponderous thinking.<br /><br />Certain details are omitted that should have been included to provide set-up for an important later event.  For example, early in the book Tanis discovers that the door to Tika's cottage is open, despite his conviction that it had been closed and bolted.  Why was Tanis sure of this?  The authors don't say.  The reader, flipping back through the pages, trying vainly to find out who had closed and bolted the door, or who SAID he was going to close and bolt the door, or who had been SUPPOSED to close and bolt the door, finds nothing to justify Tanis' mistaken belief.  The reader thus becomes annoyed for having wasted his time.<br /><br />Emotions oscillate from extreme to extreme, from brotherly love to hatred and back again, with no more provocation than a few careless words.  The main characters often have strong feelings, but they are usually not based on anything that might be reasonably expected to evoke them.  When changes of mood do have a plausible basis for evocation, such as when the heroes entered the ruins of Goldmoon's tribe, their effect on the characters has a cardboard quality.  You are told that the characters feel very badly indeed about the desolation around them, but somehow the reader is not fully convinced.  That might be because Tanis and Riverwind have the emotional complexity of Frank and Joe Hardy; i.e., none to speak of.<br /><br />The \\"serious\\" combat scenes are usually implausible and sometimes just plain goofy.  At best, the reader gains the impression that time moves rapidly here, in this paragraph, but much more slowly there, in that paragraph.  At one point, the draconians are skillful and efficient fighters who easily capture the heroes.  A few pages later, these \\"intelligent\\" fiends are deceived by a simple trick and set to running hither and yon, screaming in terror, confused and disorganized, and remaining so for long enough that Sturm and Flint could break apart a fake dragon, carry off its wooden head, extract Tas, and hold a lengthy conversation about what they should do next.  This is slapstick, not serious fantasy.<br /><br />(Correction: The lengthy conversation in that particular episode of combat occurred during Tas' rescue from the burning wicker dragon, and not afterward.  I'd misremembered.  However, in this story there are times when it seems that enemies might show up at one of the heroes' planning discussions, expecting to fight, but being told by Caramon, \\"Go back to freaking out.  We aren't done talking yet.\\"  And the villain does indeed turn around and run away, and apparently none of the other heroes even noticed he was there.)<br /><br />Another conspicuous flaw is the too-rapid shifting of viewpoints, from Tanis, to Flint, to Sturm, back to Tanis, to Raistlin, to Goldmoon, back to Tanis again, to Tasselhof, to Caramon, again to Tanis...  It is possible to have more than one viewpoint character in a book, but the shifts should come less rapidly.  The viewpoint should stay with one character long enough for the reader to fix in his mind how that one character regards each of the others.  Weis & Hickman bounce the viewpoint around as if it were a basketball, with three or four shifts occurring on a single page.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, the story is a good one.  The stylistic awkwardness may be compared with a chair made from good, but unfinished, wood.  Had it been sanded and polished, the chair could have been a work of art; instead it's a merely rugged chair that puts splinters into unwary butts.  In the same way, Dragons of Autumn Twilight could have been a masterpiece, but it was left in a rough state of storytelling with annoying splinters.anded and polished, the chair could have been a work of art; instead it's a merely rugged chair that puts splinters into unwary butts.

B00003CXA2|4.0|Forrest Gump is a great movie, one of the classics in movie history, and one of the biggest box-office greats, it gets 4 stars because of the movie, minus one because of the DVD, from how of a wait it was to wait for this DVD, it could have been way better, it's good if you VHS version is breaking but not good if you just want it because you're expecting the greatest DVD.
B0002O06N0|4.0|I just got this cd 2 weeks ago and I love it, its great, its just  what I was looking for, didnt know them never heard of them but   now I will be getting thier other cds.You have rock and roll and  you have blues and this is a kick [...] cd, there voice's are not  great but niether is joe cocker's, if you want to get loose and   burn some rubber off your shoes than buy this cd. Song for song   its really good,I cant wait to get the next one.
B00005JMAH|5.0|i don't like how some people said that it didn't follow the book exactly how it was, in my view, and this has to do with my taste in movies that come from books, what's the point on going to watch a movie, after you read the book, all you are going to do is point scenes that movie missed or changed, watch the movie because it is a movie, i love how they did this movie. They changed things around to make more suspense, and it works, the dimentors will scare the crap out of young children, hell that hand of the dementor in the beginning still gives me the chills. The dialouge was change, and again i like that, i can't speak for anyone else who has watched it, but i like and that's just how i feel. Alfonso Cuaron, even though not as good as Chris Columbous, gives great effort on his first Harry Potter film, people shouldn't make fun of him, because a guy that has never done a story like this one, the movie could have been way worse. Great 3rd movie and i believe in its own way, is superior to the first 2.
B000002MQ9|5.0|'With In the Realm of a Dying Sun' by dead can dance is one of the few examples of new music harkening back to olden times. In a similar approach as the dramatic art rock bands of the Prog era. If any thing this album goes one step beyond that of even the elite bands like VDGG & King crimson. Xavair stands out. Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard are the best at what they do and they do it with the same intensity as any one before them.<br /><br />  Sit back, close your eyes and enjoy the  pageantry, the romance, and the majesty of this great band.
B0000025ZK|3.0|.......how often you listen to a record/CD, how would you rate it then.<br /><br />I would have to say I listen to this release, once a year and why is that? There are some great moments here. I love Murder and Near the End.....those 2 alone are good compositions. The problem is...I don't think this is a complete album. Just like Roger's solo stuff....there are those contributing misses which make the Pink Floyd solo material fall short. No different with Division Bell and Momentary...lots of hired on help to try to continue the Magic......but it doesn't work.<br /><br />If you rated this 5 *'s, then you must think it stands up well with other Pink Floyd classics...like The Wall and DSOTM. I like this release....but don't insult anyone's intelligence by thinking its a MUST!!
B000002ADT|4.0|Well, Mr. Schenectady, all I wanna say is \\"Listen!\\". This album, if you notice, is called \\"Kind of Blue\\": what were YOU expecting, \\"Jimi Thing\\" featuring Joe Satriani? For all I know, the walking bass lines and lazy swings DO contribute to the MOOD and COLOUR of this album, if I may say so. That doesn't, really, in any sense mean that you HAVE to like it. See, the Beastie Boys are the Beastie Boys, and no goddamn \\"contemporary rap act\\", with the blackest of the guys from the Bronx, can up the ante over those three guys doing their thing. I do listen to Eminem, but as far as the Beasties go, I'd sure opt for their gig than watch Marshall Mathers with some supposed hot-shot producer. It's about keeping it real when you have so many choices.  <br />But it's also about knowing, where, perhaps, songs like \\"Typical Situation\\" come from, thank you very much. I'd love to know your views on \\"Sketches of Spain\\", honest! Btw, have you ever tried The Yellowjackets?
068987474X|1.0|I'm a guy...My advice to women who want some level of commitment and honesty from men: avoid the players! If they press all your buttons and do all the \\"right\\" things then you are most likely letting them emotionally manipulate you. These guys have learned their craft by dating and dropping scores of innocent and naive women who believe that the \\"right\\" guy is a carbon copy of a television soap. This archetype in the real world is more often than not a fake. Men with these personalities are the male equivalent of women who dazzle guys with their feminine 'assets'. <br /> <br />How does this relate to the book? These so-caled rules about how to tell if a man is interested are a double-edged sword. If you follow these rules whole-heartedly like the book suggests you are opening youself to (s)exploitation. Why? Because the rules are incredibly easily to fake! Men might buy this book to learn exactly what to do to trick you. <br /> <br />And please don't cry when men choose prettier women, because women break men's hearts by choosing sleazy guys and smooth players more often than you would think.
B0000TB050|5.0|U2 is crazy beautiful....this live CD sends chills down my spine.  U2 is amazing -- I mean SLANE CASTLE!!

Sit back or jump up and down like me ---but then again anyone who holds the beauty key to life already has this.
B00003CXA2|5.0|our language, this is the one dvd they must take home. I realize that make me very America-centric, but at this time, in history, ours is the leading culture on earth. It's been many years since I first saw this in a movie theater, but I still watch it every so often. Forrest Gump is proto-American. He's dumb, but honest,loyal, brave, stubborn & unsophisticated. I like to think that most Americans have integrity. The incidents in his life are history, spanning the most dynamic years of the American century. Truly, truly an epic American film classic.

B00069FLC2|5.0|WOW ! Shadows' fans everywhere, rejoice ! Here is the fabulous DVD of their final tour that not only meets, but exceeds all expectations. This is a special treat for us fans in Canada and the USA, where in the US at least, this great group has never been on the radar screen.    Before you read on--a confession. Ever since I heard their first hit \\"Apache\\" in 1960, I have been a diehard fan--so this review is very, very biased ! I considered them then--as I do now--to be the greatest pop/rock instrumental band in the world.  The Shads--as their legions of fans call them--had not played together in several years. Fortunately, due to constant fan support all over the globe, they decided to get back together for this final tour. They became stars, first as Cliff Richard's back-up group, then in their own right, about 45 years ago, when they were scarcely more than teenagers--do the math--they aren't kids anymore. However, like a fine wine, the Shads have actually improved with age--they never sounded better or played better than in this marvellous concert, recorded in Cardiff, Wales, earlier this year.    Of course, the Shads are--Hank Marvin, lead guitar--Bruce Welch, rhythm guitar--Brian Bennett, drums. They are accompanied on this tour by two other fine musicians--Mark Griffiths, bass and Cliff Hall, keyboards. You really get your \\"moneys worth\\" with this concert--it clocks in at around three hours and includes 39 numbers from their long career.    There is a lot of variety here--exciting, fast-paced tunes like The Savage\\", \\"Geronimo\\", \\"Shazam\\", \\"Shadoogie\\", \\"Gonzales\\" and \\"FBI\\"--lovely melodic numbers like \\"Atlantis\\", \\"Theme for Young Lovers\\",\\"Theme from the Deer Hunter\\" and the timeless \\"Wonderful Land\\". Hank and Bruce have always been good vocalists too, and two of their big vocal hits are included, \\" Don't Make My Baby Blue\\" and \\"Let Me Be the One\\". They also pay tribute to their old \\"boss\\", Sir Cliff, with several of his hits which the Shads wrote--\\"The Day I MetMarie\\", \\"Gee Whiz It's You\\", \\"Summer Holiday\\" and \\"Bachelor Boy\\".    I was also impressed with their overall performance--they really seemed to be having as much fun as the audience. Brian Bennett gets several chances to show that he can play drums with the best of them--his showcase \\"Little B\\" is a clinic for aspiring drummers everywhere. Bruce Welch shows us, as he has for years, that there is more to rhythm guitar than just strumming--he's no slouch as a \\"picker\\" either--listen to his duet with Hank on the jazzy \\"Nivram\\". As for Hank Marvin--beautiful lead guitar work--the man who gives the Shads their unique sound--the man who \\"launched a thousand guitar players\\" ( probably more ! )--my favourite guitarist, sounding better than ever.    I found the technical quality of the DVD to be excellent--the picture sharp and clear--for sound, all important for this group, I picked the DTS option--really outstanding. I felt like I had a front row seat !    The DVD also includes a very relaxed and informative interview with Hank and Bruce, remembering their childhood in Newcastle   (no wonder Mark Knopfler is a fan !), and then moving to London to find fame and fortune. Brian joins them about half way through the interview, and recalls how he joined the group. There are also scenes of their post-tour party in London, with people like Brian May, Queen's great guitarist, paying tribute to the Shads, and Hank in particular. Also at the party--Sir Cliff himself, sounding quite wistful that he may never get a chance to perform with his old mates again. C'mon, Cliff--they said \\"last tour\\" not last concert--if anyone can talk them into something really special, say for a worthy charity, gee whiz it's you !    I know that five stars is the \\"max\\" under this system, but--as I'm sure you can tell--this disc is worth a lot more to me than that--much more. For Shads fans, this DVD is a wonderful testament to the music and talent of Hank, Bruce and Brian. For people who were never exposed to \\"Shadowmania\\", why not see what you have been missing ? ! My highest recommendation.    A footnote dated 13 July 2010--Shadows' fans should be aware that this marvellous concert has now been released on a Blu-ray disc. Since the original DVD, reviewed above, was pretty special to begin with, I wondered what I could expect from the Blu-ray disc. It is--in a word--spectacular. Of course, the visual quality is enhanced, but the sound is tremendous. Close your eyes and you'll think that Hank is playing in your living room ! Of course, you might need a large living room ! Anyway, you get the drift. In addition to all the great numbers mentioned in my review, there is another that I would like to mention--the beautiful \\"Mountains of the Moon\\" which opens the second half of the concert--quite mesmerizing. So, if you dig the Shads and have invested in a Blu-ray player, \\" Let me be the one\\" to say that you are in for quite a treat !
B00004R99F|1.0|I'm going to break from everyone's reviews here and say that I found this movie to be annoying, cheesy, and just plain dumb.  I guess that's why everyone liked it, but I for one didn't.  My husband thought it was great, my kids think it's great, and I can't wait to return it to the library.<br /><br />If there's one thing I'm sick of, it's fathers being portrayed in the media as bumbling idiots...or insensitive control freaks and all the children in Disney movies it seems disrespect their parents.<br /><br />I cannot think of a single Disney movie with a positive role model for a dad and with children who respect him, with the exception of Ol' Yeller, and in that case, the father is gone for 90% of the film.<br /><br />Goofy is yet another addition to the \\"Stupid Fathers\\" club, and I'm disappointed to say the least, but not surprised.  I only gave this one star because I can't give it zero.
0816158525|5.0|This book Embraced by the Light by Betty Eadie is one of the books to be on any NDE experiencer's bookshelf, even if it is simply for the early historical basis and the \\"warm fuzzy\\" feeling that her eloquent writing invokes in the reader. The Light of love and the Light of God felt and seen at the NDEs is something I myself experienced eight years ago. This book, Dannion Brinkley's book Saved by the Light, and Tiffany Snow's book Psychic Gifts Tools to Connect and any of Raymond Moody's books, are a welcome and necessary part of any curious visitor to the near-death experience, and I would also suggest reading all the information complied by IANDS.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|To the guy who said Queens of the Stone Age suck.... <br /> <br />Keep listening to Britney Spears and Assley Simpson and keep your emotard bashing in the grade school playground where it belongs.  QOTSA is one of the greatest rock bands since the days of Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin.  I would recommend buying anything that has Josh Homme's name attached to it especially Kyuss.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|A must only for true Ray Charles' fans who already own his better records. Unlike the recent \\"farewell recordings\\" of Johnny Cash and Warren Zevon, who, like Ray, knew they were dying while recording, this disc lacks emotional heft. For the most part, the disc sounds like it was dreamed up by some producer and Ray thought he'd cash it in.   <br />When it works, as it does intermittently, it's usually because of the other singers (\\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" with James Taylor,the Willie Nelson duet and a better-voiced Ray with Van Morrison are the standouts). And I agree there is a kind of wacky, interesting appeal to the Elton John recording (\\"Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word.\\") Elton's voice is maturing nicely, and that song has a lot more emotion than it used to. But the record is often dull (Norah Jones and Diana Krall, sorry, you are the two blandest singers in the history of popular song), though with the high production values we have come to associate with fine Ray recording.  All in all, it's a Starbucks kind of recording. Pleasant to drink coffee to, but it won't take up too much attention.
B00003CXIY|3.0|The best thing that makes this movie deserve just 3 stars is some of the music. This movie is barely a gag, and it is OKAY, but some of the songs played is what I like best about it. The song  by the Eels and that \\"I WANNA ROCK\\" song, especially!!
B00027JYLC|5.0|\\"Freaks\\" was directed by Tod Browning, who also directed \\"Dracula,\\" and both of them are included on my Top 50 list. Of all the earlier movies that I have seen, this has to be the oddest, but it is brilliant in it's own way. Had this movie been made at this point in time, the freaks would have been all made with famous actors that have had computer's affecting the way they look, to make it look odd. The beauty of watching this version, which was made in 1932, was that all of the freaks were real. I don't use the term \\"freaks\\" to be mean, but I am trying to refer to the title of the movie. On the outside, these freaks are just people to make fun of, and you could laugh or be disturbed by their appearance, but they are people too, and this movie touches the emotions of them. This movie is not made great, but it is so odd, and so fun to watch that it's hard to hate it. The acting isn't so good, but it's not supposed to be. The sound could be a little shotty at time, but that grows over time. The point is, you should see this movie to experience this odd world. It's a world unlike anything we've ever seen, because this point in life you don't know what's real or not. This is the real thing. Harry Earles plays Tiny Hans, the \\"main character.\\" He doesn't have a large credit list, but was in a few silent films, and his last movie was \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" If you have that, he's one of the lollipop guys, the one in blue. He's not a great actor, as this movie could prove, but he's such a likeable guy, that you have to feel sorry for him as you watch this. <br /> <br />Tiny Hans in one of the circus freaks. Him and Frieda, who is played by his real life sister, are in love, and Hans claims that he will never stop loving her. That is, until a grown women by the name of Cleopatra is sweet to him, but she just has her eyes set on his fortune. She has a man in her life, and he is a normal one, and his name is Hercules. Cleopatra \\"flirts\\" with Hans, and Hans flirts with Cleopatra, until they finally end up getting married. Hans is in love, but Cleopatra is greedy. After getting married, she plans on killing him, but after she and Hercules get drunk at the wedding party, they end up embarressing him. The other freaks learn what she plans to do, so they end up hatching a plan. This plan is so violent, and horrifying, that it's just so amazing to see this. <br /> <br />The most amazing thing about \\"Freaks\\" is the freaks themselves. The movie is kind to the freaks, and they never make fun of them. I like how they show all of these special talents that the freaks have. There is one freaks that doesn't have any arms or legs. When he walks, he has to crawl on his mid-section. There is one scene where he lights a cigarette, and it is amazing to watch. There is a man that has no legs, and he walks on his hands. The great thing is, is that he runs on his hands faster than all of the people that I know that run on their feet. There are two women that are stuck together, and when one of them kisses his boyfriend, the other one can feel it, and she smiles in pleasure. There was a women who ate with her foot, and a half women-half man. We get to see their special talents, and it is a message to the viewer that they are peopel too. The people that try to use their odd looks to hurt them. There is such a difference in all of these characters, that it's hard to understand the cruelness of man. \\"Freaks\\" is a horror movie, that was actually banned in many countries, and still in Sweden, until recently. It's so shocking because it's different. I'm sure at the time people saw this they feared these people. Half of the freaks just had odd shaped faces, and they are extremly different. This is one of my favorite movies, and I recommend you to see it just to see these talents that many people overlook just because they look a little different. <br /> <br />ENJOY! <br /> <br />Rated NR but I would actually rate it PG-13 for Strong Thematical Elements.
B00003CWTI|1.0|If a director is going to make a movie that is 3 hours long, he better have point it to, or else he will waste everyone's time. What was the point of 'Magnolia'? I couldn't help myself asking this question after sitting through this long borefest. Is P.T. Anderson trying to say life is messed up and many people are lost? Does it really take 3 hours to show this point? I guess he is also trying to say that things happen by chance, but it is not really a chance at all. Something greater is at work here connecting people's lives together. Interesting point, but he does not do that in the movie! There are some strong performances, especially by Tom Cruise, but the entire movie is not worth the sum of its parts. It has many characters I didn't care about. It had many stories I didn't care about. Some people really like this movie, but I think they are looking deeper into something that isn't really there. It tries to be deep and profound, but in the end, it comes up empty and really has nothing to say.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|Buddy is a very likable character.  He is the type that every mother would love to cuddle and protect, even though he is a big elf.  I enjoyed this movie in the theater with the kids and I emjoyed it again on DVD.
B000001EYO|4.0|The absence of Creedence is an eastern thing, y'all -- note also that the Eagles' \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", though present in the movie, is not included either.  CCR and the Eagles negate each other, like matter and anti-matter (respectively). <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|Ever since I saw U2 open for J. Geils back in 1979 --a prelude to many great albums following \\"Boy\\" --I have liked them  (I was there to see U2, but did stay for J. Geils!).  Their songs have substance and emotion.  Yeah, they are commercial--but with each album they have somehow reinvented themselves.. sometimes I have liked the change, other times I was not really all that interested.<br /><br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb harkens back to the U2 Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree albums... my favorites from U2.  And, why not?  With the likes of Steve Lillywhite, Daniel Lanois, and Brian Eno in on the production (along with Flood) you could not expect any less. This is the first U2 album I have been enamoured of since Joshua Tree.  It is not that I do not own the others, it is just that they did not remain in my CD player long enough.  On first listen I expect this album to hang out in my player for months.
B00008K7AM|5.0|i love funny movies that can be watched over and over. this is definitely one of them! it's lighthearted and funny. i love rob schneider though, so maybe i'm a little biased. it's a good choice if you just wanna relax, enjoy, and not really think too hard for awhile.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Reviewing Star Wars is a bit difficult: since everybody has seemingly had a taste, what is there to say? I think this trilogy was (and still is) fantastically successful not for any one reason, but because it includes basically all of the elements that audiences typically like in films: a suspenseful good-vs.-evil plot, likeable characters, great action scenes, big special effects and (to top it off) a monumental score by John Williams. Although often referred to as a \\"science fiction\\" series, Star Wars really involves little if any science. It's more of a mythological fantasy that happens to take place in outer space. (In this sense, it is distinguished from Star Trek, which sometimes got bogged down in technical details and trying to make \\"intelligent\\" commentaries on current events. Not that I dislike Star Trek, but it can't quite achieve the level of pure entertainment seen here). <br /> <br />STAR WARS (1977), rechristened after its release A NEW HOPE, was the dream project of George Lucas which everyone else thought would fail completely. (In fact, so did Lucas himself, until opening day when it began its record-breaking run at the top of the box office). It's also the only film in the series that can be understood by itself, without the others, not surprisingly. <br /> <br />THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) is often considered the best of the series, thanks to its darker and more dramatic tone, and its skillful character development. <br /> <br />RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983) has been criticized for leaning towards \\"cutesiness\\" in the form of the furry Ewoks, but it also has moments of great intensity in the final battle between the good guys and the evil Empire. <br /> <br />Of course, it has to be said that these are technically not the same films that came out over twenty years ago. The changes made in the late-90s Special Editions are still here, along with a few more odds and ends altered. The changes do not detract from the overall entertainment value of thefilms, and personally I think you would have to be a true purist not to want to own this set, as it looks and sounds great. <br /> <br />There is also a bonus disc with a two-and-a-half hour documentary that takes you through the making of the trilogy, and some other goodies that any Star Wars fan should naturally see. <br /> <br />Overall, a pretty nice set.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I was listening to this CD yesterday while looking at magazines and I think its wonderful. Im also wondering how she could make a CD this long and keep up with her 3 year old boy. I hope she starts writing more CDs and I hope this is not her last.
B000669GAI|5.0|Im not the biggest Pearl jam fan, but i loved Ten and a few of their singles since...but i must say for the price of one cd to get a double cd greatest hits package is one of the best value for money this year. The packaging and set list are superb and the idea to break it into 2 cd's (one \\"up\\" and one \\"down\\") was a truly fantasic idea. They could have easily charged double the price for this item. The music rocks... Ive found myself with a new appreciation of Pearl Jam. Ive always liked the principles they stood up for , now i like their music just as much. Cheers!
0140277447|1.0|The trial of the vanquished by the victors cannot be impartial no matter how it is hedged about with the forms of justice.   - Senator Robert A. Taft, October 5, 1946    Between two countries at war there was always a danger that one or other of the combatants would seek to turn public opinion in his favour by resort to a propaganda in which incidents, inseparable alas (!) from all hostilities, were magnified and distorted for the express purpose of inflaming prejudice and passion and obscuring the real issues of the conflict.   - Sir Charles Addis at Chatham House, November 10, 1938    World War II and the movement of Resistance were the 'Battle against Fascism'. Therefore, the false assumption was made that Japan was regarded as same as Hitler's Germany and such absurd remark has been spread within Japan and it is indeed unbearable. For that very reason, I, with a firm conviction, wrote this book in order to counter-attack such false assumption.   - Alfred Smoular, Auschwitz 186416 dies in Japan    [...]
B00004VXF2|5.0|I feel silly giving Metal Machine Music any kind of \\"star\\" review. What if Lou had released each of these tracks as separate singles? Would you ever be able to compare them?? No I don't think so... <br /> <br />Merzbow is so much more violent and, er, noisier than this. This is easy listening for the noise set. Could Lou Reed ever have guessed that this could be considered tame and rather calm to some people, three decades in the future? But, honestly, I like both Merzbow and MMM just fine. I listen to them often, whenever I grow tired of anything with any kind of musical structure. The Beatles, David Bowie, Public Image Ltd, Kraftwerk, Radiohead, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Mouse on Mars, Ramones, Suicide, Madonna? They are all equally pop compared to this. Sometimes you just gotta hear pure raw noise. It cleanses your palette. <br /> <br />But it's still just noise. Take it with a grain of salt. Or is all music just a noise (and is all noise equal)? <br /> <br />Merzbow once said that \\"if a noise is an uncomfortable sound, then pop music is noise to me\\". How can you argue with that? Every human being on this planet has a unique perception. I hope. <br /> <br />Lou Reed has never done anything like this since, and this was probably his way of having fun stoned and ending the pressure he felt from his label and fans. Maybe it was just a \\"faq you\\". Whatever the reason for it's birth, it's power and influence cannot be denied. You will either hate every second of it or you will listen to it at the oddest of times. Not that anybody would ever be able to understand why you'd be listening to this unless they were listening with you. <br /> <br />There's a funny little story on the web. It'll interest anybody who has heard this album. Here is the address: [...]
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|Lets be frank. I generally don't care for country music. The idea of 'millionaire rednecks' such as Toby Keith or stunning Faith Hill pretending to live in the very same world as their fan base ( who may or may not reside in a trailer park close to you! ) I find not only ingratiating but patently phony as well. To have some artist who relies upon pretending to empathize with the 'common man' is more then I can stomach so I tend to give a wide berth to country musics finest. Simply put most of todays country stars are appallingly mediocre and tend to rely heavely either on looks i.e. Ms. Hill or controversy such as Toby Keith. Nevertheless...    Why I felt compared to pick up a copy of Shania Twains Gretaest Hits is beyond me. Obviously Ms. Twain is an extremely popular artist who has made the most of her attractiveness married with a marketing skill ( along with hubby/producer 'Mutt' Lange ) that has catapulted her to the top of the country/pop charts. That being the case I had a certain curiosity as to why she was so in demand. Plus, to be perfectly honest I obtained the disc at a discount price from a local retailer so feeling that the stars were aligned in a certain manner I thought...\\" what the heck! \\" Mmmm, I've got to stop doing that!    I must admit the disc starts off well with \\" Forever and Always \\" a sweet mid-tempo ballad that I enjoyed and found extremely pleasant. But things quickly went down hill from there and fast although I do believe I have begun to have a much better understanding of why she is so popular. Not only with guys ( natch! ) but equally with other women as well. Anyway, the next few songs, from tune #2 thru #5, were, for the most part, little more then 'girl power' songs whose demographics were most definitely not mine. Sorry, but the popular single \\" Up! \\" while laden with pop hooks also included some of the most embarrassingly juvenile lyrics ever to come out of my stereo's speakers and I almost laughed at the sheer silliness of it all. But interestingly enough Shania's popularity with women seems gauged simply due to the majority of her songs sung from the viewpoint of not an adults complex issues concerning love, commitment and other complicated issues but her tunes most definitly are angled toward the younger female whose life experiences are, at least at this point in their young lives, extremely limited. Again sorry, but Shania singing about \\" Man I Feel Like a woman \\" or \\" That Don't Impress Me Much! \\" is taylor-made for the younger girls in the audience who are able to empathize with Shania's rather endearing though very inconsequential concerns. Nevertheless, these songs strike a note with her core audiece and apparently are loyal enough to puchase her cd's in volume.     Overall, I did manage to get thru the rest of the disc but found the going very difficult indeed! \\" From This Moment On \\" while earnest enough was an overpowering ballad that I can imagine is being played at weddings the country over. I did enjoy \\" You're Still The One \\" but couldn't slog thru \\" Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under \\" and didn't come close to hearing all of \\" Don't! \\" The whole affair came across as not only incredibly innocuous but, and here I will hand it to Shania and hubby \\"Mutt\\" (?)...they certainly know how to market themselves. If anything her music left a truly bad after-taste in my mouth as though it was little more then a very capable marketing-ploy and one in which young teens and the like were easily susceptible to. Obviously the tag-team of Shania/Mutt been incredibly successful and while I understand the music is designed to catch the interests of the younger set ( who no doubt find Shania's quaint concerns appealing ) its almost somewhat unseemly and uncomfortable as well. But only due to the obvious fact that while Shania certainly can carry off the ''attitude' aspect that her songs require she possess's very little actual singing ability. Then again, no doubt, thats hardly what was the marketing boys at Mercury Nahville, her recording lable, were searching for.    P.S. I must add that for pure irony isn't it amazing ( and extremely telling! ) that at the ripe young age of 70 Loretta Lynn has released a disc, the amazing \\" Van Lear Rose \\" that someone of Shania's somewhat limited talents could only dream about! Even though country music has recently become very generic it's comforting to know that somehow, some way the cream can still rise to the top.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I loved this film so much, I watched it 3 times a day lol. Sounds totally crazy but it's one film I can never tire of. It was a complete breath of fresh air compared to some of the Hollywood rubbish they pump out nowadays. You've probably already got an idea of the story and frankly I don't wanna write much about the storyline cos it sort of ruins it. You'll have to watch it twice at least to fully understand it though.  <br /> <br />Beautiful shots and quirky special effects, its one of the coolest films but in a totally artistic way, none of that expensive, unoriginal stuff that is all too often in the cinema.  <br /> <br />It also has a very beautiful and striking story that stays with you after you leave the cinema which is unusual. I really reccomend it highly. :)
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer is not for the softcore BS \\"metal\\" fan. This is one of the most evil and heavy thrash/speed metal albums ever. Some argue that it's the best of that genre, which is a simple matter of opinion. If Reign in Blood simply sounds like noise to you and you can't at least appreciate the skill that went into making it, then you're very ignorant about music. Slayer is one of the best examples of a truly well-rounded band, where there is no lack of skill at any position. You don't hear this on the radio for a reason, it doesn't fall under all that crap radio rock/metal garbage that you do hear. It's very anti-commercial, which I dig. True metal fans should at least recognize the significance of this album, whether it's their style, or not.
B0000696I0|4.0|I hadn't watched this movie in years, I was a huge Turtle fan back in the day, but then I bought the 3-disc movie set and the first one I popped in was Secret of the Ooze to watch with my friends.  It was 10 times funnier than I remember because there were so many jokes that I never picked up on/got when I was kid that I can now (eg. the Ralph Nader/net joke).   <br /> <br />The movie is much lighter and campier than the first but it works better that way.  I mean, come on, we're dealing with a group of teenage mutant turtles who were trained in the art of the ninja by a giant rat named Splinter in New York City.  You can't take it too seriously and the movie works well to just have fun with Leo, Donnie, Ralph and Mikey.  The one flaw of this movie was no more crazy Casey Jones and the addition of that annoying Asian kid Keno (Surf Ninjas, another classicly bad great movie).  Aside from that, I liked that the turtles had to deal with the fact that there origins were essentially a scientific \\"uh oh\\" and this movies has some of the best lines.  Donnie: You take the ugly one! <br />Ralph: No, you take the ugly one!   <br />Leo: I'll take the ugly one!   <br />Mikey: Which one's the ugly one?! <br /> <br />Oh, it doesn't get any better than that.  Oh wait, Vanilla Ice is in the movie too so I guess it does.
B0002OERI0|5.0|by far, one of the best cds i have ever listened too. i have been a green day fan for about 4 years now, and all i can say is they are getting better and better. every song is great, and i would love to see them try to out do this cd on their next, but with the greatnes of this album, it will be very hard. props to green day for their hard work.
B00013F38K|5.0|A truly beautiful, inspiring series. <br />Read Davids autobiography. Somehow he is Caine and his antithesis at the same time. I'd bet you could get off the roundabout David, but like you said - its fun. Thank you David and all those involved. You made my world a better place.
B000067CPX|4.0|This is a great band that is looking for a new direction, they can't make funk records every album.  Their is a great mix of music here and they still got Flea, the best bassist ever!!! So the foruma works, great CD by RHCP but it's no BSSM.
0140277447|3.0|Why are those Japanese bashers so ignorant and barbaric? They just exclaim the hateful bigotry without any rational thinking, reminding me of religious fundamentalists. And why are those critical of Iris Chang more frequently educated and civil? This should tell something about Iris Chang too. Education should not indoctrinate; it should enlighten, which means open yourself up to self-criticism.    By the way, contrary to the recently common accusation, Japan has made public apologies to China many times for what it did during the war. [...]    What \\"education\\" are we talking about here? I'm not gonna start listing the atrocious instances of China's human right violation.
B0006399FS|5.0|All you fans are fake, what is this that u2's new albulm is not good. I can bet that 90 percent of you out there are a bunch of adults from the 80's u2, bunch of old farts. You people cant expect the same thing over and over again. jUst like they once said..fans want new material..there you have it and you dont even like it!! u2 cant be 80's u2 because that wouldnt make any sense, its like if the beatles would still be out there recording albulms sounding like 70's music. You old farts have to move on. This music is way better than the crap that is being thrown out there today. As for u2 and apple merging, yea know your stuff, u2 doesnt get any money, and at least someone is trying to stop piracy, by writing some good music and inventing new ways of paying for music. U2 will always be the best rock band even if others dont like it. These lyrics on the new albulm all have a meaning, and i guess people dont like it because its just too good!  And yea, if you are a real u2 fan, you should know that each cd takes more than once to enjoy, but if you are a fake one just like thsese people i sense that are writing fake reviews knowing that they enjoy emenimen music, then go back to alisha , cynthia and all of the bunch of \\"fake\\" musicians who dont even write their own music!! Peace
B0001D0FTW|3.0|This double kicking drums destroys the potential of a lot of otherwise marvellous metal songs. Why? Because after some minutes into the album this double kicking madness becomes really annoying, unhearable. German metal bands love to use them. What a boring thing!
B0006399FS|2.0|I, like others who have reviewed this album, am a huge fan of U2.  I've been to many concerts, have all the albums, etc..  With that being said, understand me when I say that this album is a huge disappointment.  When 'Vertigo' was released I, like others, expected this album to be a break-through as the 'Achtung Baby' album was, instead we have a repeat of 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' that is completely watered-down.  'Vertigo' is easily the most definitive song on this album, while the remainder seems to have been strictly written for use in doctor's offices or to listen to while hanging out with your significant other.  With as much time as the band put into this album, you would expect something powerful from start to finish rather than a melancholy reminder of how shattered the world is. <br /> <br />I still love U2's music, I just hope that they try a little harder next time around.  If you love U2 as well, than obviously you must hear it for yourself, but if you are teetering on the fence I suggest that you invest in Maroon 5's 'Song's About Jane' album so that you won't be disappointed.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|Rush is still a great band, and if the crowd noise on the DVD were lower, this live performance would have risen to the top of my list, which is still headed by a couple of Dream Theater performances. I don't know who wanted the crowd this loud in the final mix, but they obviously move in cheap pop-music circles and have absolutely no idea of how to mix virtuoso performances (compare with Dream Theater Live in Tokyo, for example).
B0006399FS|2.0|I am shocked at how many people have reviewed this latest offering so well. I listened to it once and after being throroughly disappointed, listened to it again hoping it would grow on me ... well it didn't and still hasn't. Tracks 8 and 10 live up to the reviews, but the rest of this CD is IMHO completely without soul. \\"Atomic\\" is not even in the same ballpark as the Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. Bummer.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|well this movie is pretty good but no comparison to the book , no way! i loved the actors performances the first time i saw the movie i wasnt too excited about michael gambons performance as dumbledore ( he took over for the late richard harris) but seeing it again changed my mind alittle i just thought that it was untrue to the book i mean dumbledoor is nicer than portrayed here. i also thought that the picture quality wasnt that great for this fullscreen version(its better in widescreen) the beginning almost looked like a cheap british movie it seemed like they polished the picture  at the end to make it look phenominal but they didnt bothr with it at the beginning , slightly choppy in my opinion. and what was with this movies length? i mean its the longest book aout of the 3 but the shortest movie .. ok then(im slightly annoyed too  because goblet of fire due out nov 18 2005 is only scheduled to be 2 hrs! at this rate order of the phoenix will be 1 1/2 hours *roll eyes here )  i watched the deleted scenes on my version and thought that they should have been kept a few were lacking but most were awsome! on a slightly happier note i thought the time scene was brilliant way less confusing then i thought it would be . i kno what your thinking this persons only said the bad why did she give it 4 stars? well ill let you watch the movie yourself =)
B000002I8D|5.0|Regardless of how much criticism Phil Collins has received over the years for his solo career and for \\"what he did to Genesis\\", serious music listeners know better, and Phil's timeless, remarkably eclectic solo debut \\"Face Value\\", which came out in early 1981, is a masterpiece.  It's an album that makes good on the theory that an artist does their best work in times of personal turmoil.  Phil simply began 'fooling around' as a means to comfort himself in the wake of a painful divorce.  Apart from a cover of the Beatles' \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", a retooling of the Genesis song \\"Behind the Lines\\", and a brief uncredited acapella snippet of \\"Over The Rainbow\\" at the very end of the record, Phil wrote everything here himself, and not only is his songwriting consistently terrific, Phil is really all over the map stylistically, and yet, somehow it all holds together beautifully.  That said, this ain't some run-of-the-mill soft rock or adult contemporary album.      Even with all of the brilliant songs Phil has written over the course of his career, the first track here, \\"In the Air Tonight\\", remains a signature song that's perhaps his most enduringly popular, and for good reason.  Although the idea of suddenly switching from a very quiet part to an ear-blastingly loud part was not a new one, the song is staggeringly powerful and was a very innovative production, containing ominous drum machine, creepy synth, atmospheric Fender Rhodes, vocoder, violins, smoky electric guitar (played by long-time Collins and Genesis cohort Daryl Steurmer), heavily echoing vocals, and of course, those ferocious, booming gated drums.  Add to that the haunting lyrics and melody (I won't even get into that whole urban legend about the lyrics), and Phil`s passionate, tormented wailing on the fade, and you get one of the most cathartic songs ever recorded.  Year after year goes by, and \\"In The Air Tonight\\" continues to just sound so damn cool everytime it comes on.  It's a rare song in that I absolutely never get sick of it.      But the genius doesn't stop there.  Side 1 of the album (i.e. the first six tracks in its vinyl release) is often very quiet, such as on the starkly affecting \\"The Roof Is Leaking\\" which seems to be about the hardships of a family living in the US in the mid 1800s, and has Phil's vocals backed by just piano, banjo, & slide guitar.  The wistful \\"This Must Be Love\\" is a wonderful, mellow love song with excellent backing vocals from Stephen Bishop, whom Phil was a great admirer of--he even slips the phrase \\"never letting go\\" into the song, the title of a Bishop song.  He gives a finger-snapping horn-laden treatment to \\"Behind the Lines\\", the Genesis version (also excellent) of which had appeared the previous year on \\"Duke\\".  \\"The Roof Is Leaking\\" segues into the dramatic, fast paced wordless piece \\"Droned\\" which gives way to another instrumental-plus-wordless-chanting track with the feel good \\"Hand In Hand\\" (which features a children's chorus).  Some pretty adventurous stuff indeed, and not exactly busting with \\"radio fodder\\" either--it's easy to see why Phil was surprised at the album's huge commercial success.  It seems that \\"In the Air Tonight\\" simply captivated the public, and carried the rather uncommercial album.      The first song on `side 2' didn't hurt either though.  \\"I Missed Again\\" was also a hit, and it's a hook-heavy song that brilliantly 'updates' the sound of '60s Motown for the '80s, with bright-sounding horns and uncanny, sophisticated chord changes.  Again, this tune just absolutely never gets old for me.  I'm hard-pressed to keep from singing along everytime I happen to hear it come on the radio.      \\"You Know What I Mean\\" is a gorgeously melodic and tender ballad which segues into the defiant, catchy kiss-off song \\"Thunder and Lightning\\".  The following track, the musically and lyrically contemplative \\"I'm Not Moving\\", is another big personal favorite of mine, a little marvel of a song, clocking in at well under3 minutes (although Phil himself seems to think little of this song these days, as it doesn't even get a mention in the DVD that chronicles the making of the album, which I mention later). The extremely sad, but hopeful love song \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy\\" is terrifically soothing --it has atmospheric strings, Fender Rhodes, and high falsetto vocals from Collins--rarely would you hear Collins' voice get this high on record ever again after this album.      He then gets psychedelic for \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", which he does in a slower rendition than the Beatles version.  Phil has explained he wanted to perform this song in a more melodic manner than the Beatles original, and it also has ominous, cathartic looping drums, and punchy Collins vocals.  I don't think it's a stretch to say it's the best cover of a Beatles song ever recorded, and personally I think it beats out the Beatles version.      Phil tacks on a brief reprise of him singing \\"Over the Rainbow\\", which I have heard is intended to be a tribute to John Lennon, who was murdered right around the time \\"Face Value\\" was being completed.  The cover of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" itself though was something Phil had already wanted to do, as Phil has stated that he already had the whole track completed well before Lennon was killed.      The production of this album, by Collins and assisted by Hugh Padgham, is masterful and supremely tasteful, and in the end, this album is truly timeless.  Phil puts himself into the recording, and he ends up with an album that is oozing with deep feeling and is all the better for it--\\"Face Value\\" is a brilliant album from one of the finest artists the so-called 'rock era' (I'd even go as far to say, of all time).  Although this CD version is not an \\"original recording remastered\\" version of the album, the sound quality is still truly excellent, a testament to how well it was originally recorded--I think a lot of the credit should go to engineer Hugh Padgham, who continued to work with Phil and Genesis with glorious results on subsequent '80s releases.  I highly encourage you not just to get this album (if you don't already) since it's absolutely essential, but also the \\"Face Value\\" DVD that's part of the \\"Classic Albums\\" series--it prominently features Phil himself, including performances from him, and it's a terrific look at the making of this incredible work of art.  The 1993 Gold CD version (pretty hard to find at this point and probably quite expensive) is also a wonderful item, with fantastic sound quality, excellent liner notes added, and a faithful reproduction of the original gatefold album that is missing from the 'standard' CD edition.
B0006399FS|4.0|Once again U2 has made another great album.  As Bono once said, \\"We will stop making music when we start making crap albums.\\"  After listening to this album multiple times, I can happily say this is a great album.  Is this album another Achtung Baby?  No, but this album is full a great songs, good lyrics, and Bono hasn't sounded this good in a long time.  The Edge's trademark sound rings clear throughtout the entire album.  Like all great albums, this one requires a few solid listens to get wrapped up in the feel of the music.
1400032717|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best books I've read this year. Told from the perspective of a 15-year-old autistic boy, Christopher Boone, it opens with Christopher finding the body of his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled upon a garden fork. Christopher likes dogs and so, using the legendary Sherlock Holmes as a role model, he decides to \\"do some detecting\\" to find out who killed Wellington. As the story progresses, however, it becomes clear that Wellington's death is only a small part of a much bigger problem, one that reveals some devastating truths about Christopher's own family.<br /><br />What sets this story apart, and makes it more than just a growing-up tale of a teenage boy with a dysfunctional family, is the unique point of view we are given by seeing the world through Christopher's eyes. His autism results in an inability to intuit normal human emotions. He does not automatically read others' facial expressions as a non-autistic person would. He can tell if someone is happy or angry or sad, but only by comparing what he sees to what he has been taught about the meanings of different body language signs. When he hears a joke, he knows from an analytical standpoint why it is funny, but he does not have the gut-level reaction that most people would. To him, it is more like solving a logic problem. He also cannot stand to be touched. Hugs and other physical contact are painful for him, so instead he gently touches fingertips with the other person as an alternate way of showing affection.<br /><br />This book was of particular interest to me because I had never really known much about autism before. The only autistic person I've ever met was also deaf, which adds an additional layer of complication to things and made it hard to tell what behavior traits were due to the autism and which were due to the added difficulty of not being able to hear. Moreover, I was only in elementary school at the time, so my own perspective on people and the world was not yet fully developed. But now, reading Haddon's book, I have been able to gain a much better understanding of autism, and that actually from an autistic point of view.<br /><br />Christopher's mind is truly fascinating. Despite his social ineptitude, he his highly intelligent, especially when it comes to math and logic. But his logic is not quite the same as an ordinary person's logic. He takes everything literally, and does not understand metaphors, labeling them all \\"lies\\" because \\"imagining an apple in someone's eye doesn't have anything to do with liking someone a lot\\" (pg. 15). Christopher is also remarkable in that he is the first and only student at his \\"special needs\\" school to take the A-level mathematics examination. His ability with numbers is amazing. In fact, when he is overwhelmed with something, he does complicated math problems in his head to calm himself down.<br /><br />\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a book I'd recommend to just about anyone. The prose is simple and easy to read, but packed with thought-provoking material. Despite Christopher's own inability to relate to human emotions, Haddon's great writing has enabled us to relate to him, and it is a highly emotional story. The text is also interspersed with numerous drawings, charts, maps, diagrams, and other graphics that Christopher uses to help tell his story. Once I picked up this book, I simply couldn't put it down. Truly a creative and insightful modern masterpiece.d.

B0002OOUP0|3.0|Yet another Stones compilation, this time from their post-British Invasion years. This used to be available only as a UK import. A lot of the songs here are classic rock staples (like \\"Start Me Up\\" and \\"Miss You\\"), and unlike a lot of collections a certain amount of thought seems to have gone into the sequencing of tunes. I'm assuming that anyone who buys this CD wants to get the best of the Stones' post 1970 output without having to drudge through the \\"Undercover\\" and \\"Some Girls\\" albums. For just a few dollars more, you'll get most of the songs here, plus most of the Stones' 1960s hits on the \\"40 Licks\\" double CD. If you're just looking for the hits, this ought to please you. <br /> <br />Why the Stones released this CD in the States so shortly *after* \\"40 Licks\\" is beyond me, as it's almost totally redundant. It's also amazing that with all the good Jagger-Richards material on their post 1970s albums, no one has tried to do a proper compilation of this period, including non-album tracks and rarities. Now that would be worth buying!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|this film underworld takes place  in a urban city setting two species the likeians(werewolves) and the gore thirsty  vampires both clans  possese superhuman abilities and are at a thousand year old battle now in secrecy for modern reasons. this movie has a lot of slow motion spinning gun shootout style of action and is not in anyway borrowing from the scfi trilogy the matrix . another keypoint of the movie is a slain vampire learder victor awoken from his slumber to bring order and advice to the vampire mansion . the movie has an unsupriseing twist and i hope you like english accents cause this movie takes place in england by the way this movie is rated r mostly because of swearing.
B0006399FS|5.0|The guitar solo in ABOY with the following bridge vocals by Bono are one of the greatest moments in u2 history, im my opinion.  Just flat out rock n' roll bringing it back to the old school WHO days.  The absolute highlight of the new album \\"How to Dismantle\\" by U2.  On their 11th studio album, the band puts together some rockers, ballad, epic songs, and traditional u2 mid-tempo songs and mold them together to create a fascinating result.  One thing I'll say for sure though, it does take a lot of listens to dismantle (phew...)
B0002YLC24|3.0|Eh, not bad. One of those semi-pleasant experiences you watch and feel mildly moved by, especially the \\"what are they gonna do\\" ending. I was more interested in the characters than what they were talking about, so I was disappointed when they ranted on about environmentalism and psychology and other boring things. It's sort of like \\"preaching-within-screenwriting,\\" and I know the actors wrote part of the screenplay themselves. I could easily imagine them sitting at their computers typing up their rants as if writing out a sermon. But the movie does improve when they talk about themselves, about their thoughts and feelings, about their lives. The acting is good, the scenery is nice, the movie itself is relaxing and ethereal at times. Not a bad experience, and I liked the characters enough to wonder what they'll do next. So hopefully they'll make another movie in another five to ten years. Hell, I hope they keep these characters around till their old age.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is U2's most spiritual album since The Joshua Tree, maybe even War. Practically every track has veiled or blatant Bible references. Do not listen to the negative reviews here. I've been a fan since 1983 and this cd is worthy to stand with Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. This music is not safe or formulaic in any way. I thought All You Can't Leave Behind was very good but sounded a little forced at times, as if it was time for the band to make a new U2 record. Not this one - Atomic Bomb flows effortlessly with catchy songs and amazing lyrics.
B000069CWE|4.0|Some bash this cd for being too Rap.  Some bash it for being too unique.  And some bash it just because it has Linkin Park on it.  But what these people don't realize is that behind this cd, is a message.  Linkin Park, wanted to try to show you their ideas from a different angle.  (and had help doing it.)  They wanted to show you that music is suppose to be thought of differently by different people.  I like this album, because even though it is an electronic clone...it still has a level of uniqueness.  The different artists ideas of linkin parks lyrics are present here, their images and words are presented.  When people listen to music, every person gets a different idea.  And this album is a fine representation of what other people thought of when hearing Hybrid.  Good album.
B0002VC924|4.0|There have been so many people saying good and bad about this movie. People say Moore bases Bush, and is anti American. Some people call it a documentary others an editorial point of view. There is even a movie made called Michael Moore hates America.<br /><br />I don't believe Mr. Moore actually makes any statements, but rather asks us to ask questions? After seeing this film how could any one not be suspicious of there government. This government murdered Kennedy yet people don't even bother to ask the question. It is totally ilrelevent if the information is not entirely accurate. You cannot ignore all the events that took place are very suspicious and need to be investigated.<br /><br />This is very powerful filmmaking, and Moore even stated that he wants to make movies not political statements.<br /><br />All that put aside I loved this movie. The Halliburton commercial was unbelievable. Its like a dream, but its not this really happened!
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />Behind all this situation of divided fans and the evident displeasure with the new album, is necessary to see the origin of all this problem: ATYCLB. Yes, that's the reason reason for this disagreement with this new LP.  <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the most mysterious chapters of the history of U2 is the complete change, despite the unquestionable commercial and artistic success of Pop ( disc that sold 10 million copies anywhere in the world, and crowned to Pop Mart like the most successful tour of the history of U2, surpassing in tickets to Zoo TV ) after Pop. In spite of all success, and the unanimous acceptance of the critic at its time, U2 took the clumsiest, easiest and inadequate way: to promise a new Joshua Tree, because they knew they knew that promising to that way the new disc it was going to be an instantaneous success of sales, not concerning the disc itself. <br /> <br />And it was, indeed. ATYCLB sold more than 11 millions copies, and became the U2 album with more grammy awards on their history. <br />U2 took as a whole reference, therefore, to ATYCLB for this new disc, due to the great success that album had ( the third better sold album of U2 ). But they forgot that Pop almost equals the same amount of the ATYCLB sales, and there began hell. A real situation that happens is that many Pop lover fans hate ATYCLB, and on the contrary, many fans that love ATYCLB hate Pop. If we took the sales from Pop and ATYCLB, an amount near half correspond to Pop, reason why it is not difficult to  understand why of this cold welcome of HTDAAB, since, because this album is quite similar to ATYCLB, fans of Pop are clearly dissapointed. <br />the attitude of U2 is incomprehensible to Pop, an exquisite and eloquent masterpiece. U2 never have hidden their hating to Pop and their absurd adoration to ATYCLB ( the worst U2 album in my opinion ). Proof of it was \\"New Mixes\\" from \\"Best\\" of 1990-2000, where they destroyed 3 songs from Pop and one from Zooropa, thing that fans didn't forgive. Thus Best Of 1990-2000, for the first time since Rattle & Hum, had clearly unfavorable and forceful critics. Now with this new disc many fans said \\"stop, all this has been too much. We are sick and tired of this comfortable and safe ATYCLB era\\". For that reason this disc receives everything what did not receive ATYCLB at his time, due to the unquestionable commercial success. <br /> <br />I dislike all this ATYCLB era, indeed, and I'm very dissapointed with this \\"bomb\\". I don't listen to effort, I don't listen to passion, I don't listen to force, I don't listen to messages, I don't listen to emotion, I don't listen to dedication nor work in this album. <br /> <br />I don't know well about what U2 were thinking when they decided to make this album, but I'm sure they were not thinking about new music. <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|To start off, 5 Stars for the acutal music, vocals, and lyrics.  U2 at their best. <br /> <br />3 Stars for the awful \\"conformity\\" that the songs have with the awful production.  What happened to the experimental u2 when they just go into a studio and aren't so uptight about how the songs come out? It seems every track was studied for months, they sound so constructed and over-produced.   <br /> <br />If you don't think u2 have it anymore go download \\"Mercy.\\"  It's like 6 minutes and for some reason it didn't make the album.  It's just so good and not so \\"organized\\", the true meaning of bass, drums, and guitars.  <br /> <br />\\"I was drinking some wine, and it turned into blood.   <br />What's the use of religion, if you're any good?\\" <br /> <br />That's the Bono I love, sounds like something off of \\"Achtung Baby.\\"  Instead of yelling the cheerful \\"the songs are in your eyes, I see them when you smile\\" (Miracle Drug), he gets down and depressing about love and yells, \\"Love is come again...I'll be gone again\\" in Mercy.  That's the U2 I want and need. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this is very good album.  But it's basically ATYCLB with more guitars by Edge.  I want to hear something more raw from U2 on their next outing.
B0006399FS|4.0|OK, some might say that this album might be too mellow or that it hardly brings anything original. <br /> <br />True, but it's still an enjoyable album that will eventually grow up on U2 fans. Yet though this might not be material of tha same kind as 'The Joshua Tree' or 'Achtung Baby', at least U2 fans should be glad that U2 is not making the same experimental electronica and junky techno from 'Zooropa' and 'Pop'. <br /> <br />I seriously can't stand the U2 of the 90s when Bono did nothing but dress up like Mechpisto with those silly horns that made him look like a complete fool. Not to mention those awful out of tune falsettos that he used to belt out loud, while he humped cameras on stage.
B000003TA4|5.0|Anyone who thinks Nirvana or this album is crap just because he wasnt a unbelievable guitar player is confused. How many albums can you listen to every track on the album without skipping?I havent found one yet other than this album. Now i bought this album around when it came out, 1991. So now most of these songs have been overplayed on the radio, If you havent heard any of the songs on this album then youve been hiding under a rock for 14 years or your just really young. Nirvana were influential for there time but dont believe that they have influenced average music like we have today. The bad pop punk music today is not because of Nirvana its because of Blink 182, blink 182 was the first pop punk band to become popular. Nirvana never wanted to be a pop band there main influences were led zeppelin and, sex pistols. If you ever heard the sex pistols you would know why kurt liked to scream and use weird singing styles and made them somehow melodic. I dont hear this type of singing on a sum 41 album or a yellowcard album, the crap punk music we have today. The only reason this band became mainstream is because they had to sign with a bigger label in order to live and continue playing,its not easy to be a poor musician.youncanly do it for so long until u have to get a real job. Kurt has said many times he never intended or thought his music would become popular and he really didnt want it to either. There alot of great guitar players that in my opinion have boring drawn out music. The music of the 80s the hairbands all for the most part were great guitar players but there music was boring didnt rock much and the drumming was just awful for the most part and they all had this womanly scream and just werent cool. Nirvana is a band that has one of the better if not the best drummer of the 90s with dave grohl mixed with novelselics pop baselines and kurts simple yet rocking riffs that are simple to play but who cares how simple they are they rocked and theres a reason whythey became so popular, id like to see someone pull it off again and make it work. Its too bad they only made one more album. Im sure that this band would of been like the beatles of the 60s and 70s were they just kept on getting better and better over time. I also dont want to hear how he killed himself and he hated his fans and they were the least talented popular band ever. Ever heard of Jimmy Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Elvis Presley they all killed themselves as well they all rocked and were pretty damn influential. Also Elvis Presley only knew how to play 4 chords. If you havent bought this album and like music that gets to the point and just rocks thentry this album out if you dont like it then thats not what your looking for.
B00008WT5E|5.0|I myself an enormous AC/DC fan did not know about this album until I was searching in the music store for AC/DC albums I didn't have. Of course you always see Back in Black, Highway To Hell, and High Voltage but this album was new to me for some reason. I already knew Riff Raff and Sin City but I bought this album and I was amazed. To think there was another great Bon album I didn't have just shocked me. I enjoyed this album a lot but I wouldn't go far enough to say it was the best AC/DC album because it really isn't but I will say it was worth the money and I'm very happy it's in my collection rather than sitting forgotten on a shelf until another person discovered it. If you want Powerage you might need to order it online because not every store has a copy.
B0006399FS|4.0|I presently have all of the previous U2 albums (including the MDH and Passengers) in my collection and this one is an excellent addition to it.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|My only negative comment about this album is that every time I listen to it I fill with hatred for Axl Rose for breaking up this great band. But there's probably people out there who don't hate him and this is your album. Don't get me wrong I listen to this cd almost every day and hearing those great songs brightens up my day. For most people Welcome to the Jungle or Paradise City is probably your favorite song but I advise you to listen to the seventh track Civil War. It is such a great song but frankly they all are. Guns N Roses was a band that could play good music slow or hard. I just hope that the long awaited new album has all the oringinal members and that it isn't as bad as the Spaghetti Incident. Of course though that probably won't happen but I encourage you to go out and buy this album because I am sure you won't regret it.
0061015725|4.0|I happens to be in the field of AI. This is one of the reasons that this book is particularly interesting to me.  <br /> <br />The starting is pretty interesting. It makes me expect an impressive ending. Unfortunately the novel ends in a rush. Author's basic understanding of AI is correct. However, as story progresses, it becomes far and far from science fiction, more like fair tale.   <br /> <br />Overall, it is an interesting novel. I have not read Jurassic Park. Howeve, if the movie basically follows the novel, this is much better than the Park. The movie is really nothing but special visual effect.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Most people who listen to Metallica probably don't listen to classical music or orchestra type music. Well Metallica combined with The California Symphony is a true masterpiece. I've always loved Metallica live but they are so good in this album. James Hetfield always adds a new touch to their songs when he performs them and I have always wanted him to sound like that in a regular album. For the band this could've been a diaster that would destroy them but they turned it into one of my favorite live albums. I also would advise if you enjoyed this album to purchase the DVD because it is just as great and it's worth every penny.
B0006284JQ|4.0|I am not the biggest fan of Britney Spears but I don't regret buying this album. I bought one of her albums a long time ago but I wasn't interested enough to buy ALL of her albums. But when this album \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" came out I thought it would be good, since it has all her hits. This is what I rate the songs: <br /> <br />1. My Prerogative, 1 of 5 stars <br />2. Toxic, 4 of 5 stars <br />3. I'm a Slave 4 U, 2 of 5 stars <br />4. Oops!... I Did It Again, 4 of 5 stars <br />5. Me Against the Music, 1 of 5 stars <br />6. Stronger, 4 of 5 stars <br />7. Everytime, 5 of 5 stars <br />8. ...Baby One More Time, 3 of 5 stars <br />9. (You Drive Me) Crazy, 4 of 5 stars <br />10. Boys, 1 of 5 stars <br />11. Sometimes, 2 of 5 stars <br />12. Overprotected, 5 of 5 stars <br />13. Lucky 4 of 5 stars <br />14. Outrageous, 1 of 5 stars <br />15. I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman, 2 of 5 stars <br />16. I've Just Begun, 1 of 5 stars <br />17. Do Somethin' <br /> <br />I also like 3 of the tracks on the bonus CD. Some of the songs on here I wouldn't call \\"hits\\" but it's Britney's CD and she can do what she wants with it. She's not one of the best singers in the world, but she's fun to sing to and some of her songs are cool. I'd recommend this CD to any Britney fan. It's not a perfect CD, but it's worth buying if you like her music.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This is such a great album to start your AC/DC collection because it's such a great album. This album is actually a mix of The Australian versions of High Voltage and T.N.T. The songs really tell us what the band is about anf they are all good in their own way. Most people like T.N.T. the best on this album but I like Rock N Roll Singer and She's got balls the best. Bon Scott's voice makes any song good and the lyrics for all of these songs are great. If you don't have any AC/DC albums I would highly recommend this album it's one of their best.
0141439807|4.0|I'm 14 and I've recently read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" after seeing most of the movies (or TV shows, specifically for Pride and Prejudice). I find that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my favorite, it's very entertaining and the story line is amazing. The first thing I had read was \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" but it was slower, it was still good, but \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the best. After reading those I bought \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Persuasion\\". I have recently finished \\"Mansfield Park\\" and I thought it was very good, but it wasn't her best. I would only suggest \\"Mansfield Park\\" to those who have already read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\". Soon I will be starting \\"Persuasion\\" I am hoping to read all of Jane Austen's books, eventually. The beginning of \\"Mansfield Park\\" is very slow, I'd say the first 100 pages were very slow. Since I saw the movie first I kept wondering \\"when will Henry Crawford start to like Fanny?\\" and during about half the book, he wasn't even interested in her. But eventually he does and that's where it really gets interesting. So if you have started to read it but stopped reading it because it is slow, I would suggest you pick it back up and begin reading it. It takes awhile to get into, but it's worth it.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This was probably the best AC/DC album yet and after a chain of almost flawless album's the future only looked better. Highway to Hell really put AC/DC on the charts with songs like Girls Got Rythum and Touched Too Much not to mention Highway Too Hell itself. The album though was the last of it's kind for the beloved singer of AC/DC passed away a few months after. Highway to Hell was Bon's best work and his voice never was better and I can only imagine what it woulda been if he hadn't died. If you don't already have this album I think it's a must have for any rock and roll collection. I find it hard to believe and Rock N Roll fan wouldn't like this great album. If you're just getting into AC/DC take my word for it this album is the right place to start your collection. After all no AC/DC collection is complete without this album and it's dynamite follow-up Back in Black.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Wow, just wow.  Words cannot describe how much I love this CD.  If you like heavy metal even remotely, you need to pick up this CD.  The guitar-work, while not extraodinarily complex, is balls-to-the-wall awesome, along with the drumming.  The vocals...  man, I love the vocals.  I suppose I'm biased when it comes to heavy metal music, as I love bands that scream, but I've let my friends, who are not into heavy metal at all, listen to this CD and they loved it. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  all the songs are awesome.  I've listened to this CD so much that my ears feel like they're going to fall off.  Plus, it's cheap.  I've found this CD at stores (Best Buy, FYE--who's notorious for high prices) for as low as $10.  With as awesome as this CD is, that's a steal!
0671027387|4.0|Thanks to Dan Brown, I am now a fan of thrillers! I have read three out of four of his works, and I'm hooked. Deception POint is one read that's definitely unputdown-able. What can I say? The book kept me guessing about what happens next, and more often than not, I couldnt guess how the events will progress from page to page. Although his writing can be formulaic, I still enjoyed the book and how it kept me glued to it.
B00065JTBA|5.0|This 4 cd and 1 dvd set is a gift from the band to the most loyal and best fans in the world, Bon Jovi fans! I say that because only the believers will appreciate the time and what a labor of love this was for all involved. It has great unheard songs, some you will recognize, pieces of others that have been reworked.. Kind of like a puzzle of unheard hits. The dvd is very personal look inside the production throwning in the patented Bon Jovi humor which will leave you in stitches! I would rate this a 10 if I could..
B0006284JQ|4.0|This is definitally a good collection of all of her singles!  It doesn't have the singles from the bottom of my broken heart, or born to make you happy, but the ones in it are well cordinated!  It might seem boring to some people since there are only 3 new songs, but if you get the special edition, it has 5 hot remixes including a megamix like the one madonna had for her ghv2!  This is a good buy, and it was released at the right time!  There's some rumors of her retiring for 2 years, but hopefully her fifth album will do as well as her first 3!
0553208845|4.0|Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha is a parable about the dream of attaining bliss and discovering the truth about the one path. The story recounts the story of a young man who meanders through life, after departing his father's home, only to flow from a life of abstinence and piety to one of wantonness and lust only then to reach a tree at the foot of a river where pausing for a sojourn he begins to truly undertake the flight of his dreams towards the content inner self.<br />On his way Siddhartha learns life and happiness from many and yet finds that none can teach him what he wants to learn. Perhaps great people can not love, he tells himself.<br />In the short story Hesse, himself at conflict with his parent, life and often mentally at odds with his world, steers the reader away from conventional thinking on love, happiness and the meaning of existence. He casts the quest in a different light than most and indirectly imparts the wisdom that all things described are arrived at through passages which are personal and self-attained. Teaching is good, but learning is better. To hear one has to seek; not trust in the voice of another. To see one must look around himself; not be shown. One has to find his own way in this world and the guiding and soothing words of a wise man are not to be interpreted for others.<br />Siddhartha teaches that the river is not a metaphor for life, but is life itself. It can even teach one to think, to wait and to fast if one listens well enough.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I don't usually buy albums that swear a lot, but some how, the swearing on this album just seems unoffensive. I love every song on this album, and despite messing around Jack is a really good singer and Kyle is a kick-ass guitar player. The skits on this album are hilarious to, as it just sounds like total improvisation. I recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Jack or Kyle or any of their movies, as these two guys are true comic proffesionals!! Can't wait for their next album and movie!!
B0006399FS|3.0|Fan of U2 for 21 years. I've listened to HTDAAB at least 24 times. One theme keeps popping up.  Separation (or divorce), lots of kneeling or \\"on my knees\\" stuff going on (forgiveness, etc.). Which makes me think the CD Title (How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb) perhaps overlays with this. Maybe someone in the band is going through a spousal rough patch.(The Bomb being the failing marriage and how to stop it--again, seperation, a major blow-up, or disagreement and forgiveness repeats over and over as a common theme).  <br /> <br />Also it just really reeks of \\"Abbey Road\\" sentiments. Not that it sounds like the Beatles. Just very \\"closure\\" likeness...Could this be the Winter CD of U2? I hope not!  <br /> <br />Vertigo is the only ripping loud song on the CD. You really need to read the lyrics and dig-in to listening to this one. It's a thinker's CD. Yes, buy it.
B0006399FS|5.0|I can never get tired of edges' guitar sound.  I am a drummer and he inspires me to want to pick up the guitar and create that sonic ear candy.  It's so simple yet tasty.  A true original.  His rhythm solo in vertigo is guitar nirvana.

B0006399FS|1.0|This was hyped as a rockin album...it sounds like Muzak for withdrawing rock addicts. I paid only ten bucks for my copy, and that's too much money for this droning piece of crap. It also reinforces my usual habit of buying ONLY greatest hits albums. The only decent song is Vertigo...the rest is slumber inducing vomit.<br /><br />A horrible disappointment!

6304884419|5.0|If you're used to seeing Robert Deniro as the tough guy gangster then get ready for a change.  In this film Deniro is just a working stiff trying to raise his kid the right way.  His son however, is fascinated by one of the local mob bosses (Chazz Palminteri).  In this story set in the Bronx (circa 1960's) Lorenzo Anello (De Niro) desparately tries to keep his son Calogero on the straight and narrow.  He tries to explain that the guy who gets up and goes to work every morning is the tough guy, not the guy who takes what others have by force. <br /> <br /> <br />Lillo Brancato who plays the 17 year old son is quite the find here.  This was his acting debut and he has gone on to do other films since.  Originally, this was a one man play written by  Palminteri and the story is based on the events of his youth. <br /> <br />Eventually, the mob boss, who can't afford to trust anyone, turns on Calogero even though he loves the boy like a son.  It is then that the teenager understands that his father told him the truth.  Later in the film though, Calogero's life is saved because of the mobster.  When Calogero goes to find his friend and thank him, things take a turn for the worse. <br /> <br />This is Deniro's directorial debut.  Who knows better how to direct a gangster film then someone that's been in some of the best crime dramas of all time.  Yes, he still has much to learn but still and all, it's a fine effort.  Deniro made excellent use of the music of the day.  Especially memorable is the bar scene where the gansters beat up a motorcycle gang and during the fight you can hear \\"The 10 Commandments of Love\\" playing over the visuals. <br /> <br />As with most gangster films, there is a lot of foul language and violence here but no nudity or sex. <br /> <br />This should be part of your collection if you are a fan of the genre.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Yes, yes, I know: Bob Geldof made a huge mistake (and that's an understatement) when he decided not to make a formal recording of the Live Aid concert in July of 1985. Geldof faced legal complications; and because he felt a sense of urgency Geldof made the decision not to record the concert. He also preferred that the entirety of the concert not ever be shown again. (Sigh) This mistake resulted in this four DVD set being incomplete as many people have noted. I cannot disagree.<br /><br />However, this four DVD set is still much, much better than us not having anything at all; and it comes with impressive extras. It also continues to fund the fight against starvation in Africa. By purchasing this DVD set you commit your money to fight starvation at the same time as your get a rather extensive view of the concert at both Wembley Stadium in London and at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia.<br /><br />For rock fans this is a great treat! You get to see, as the audience did then, an incredible and unprecedented array of talented stars all in the same concert. I agree with the reviewer who writes that by far and away Queen with Freddie Mercury is a highlight of the show! Status Quo and countless others performed at their very best, giving the performance everything they had. Their involvement was total and very strong! They mesmerized the audience which resembled an ocean of people when one camera was pulled very far back to show a shot of the entire crowd at each of the two stadiums.<br /><br />The DVD set also comes with a 22 page booklet detailing the recordings and the general overall history of the Live Aid concert. It's well written and there are color photos as well as black and white photos. The booklet that comes with the set states that the sound and picture quality vary. However, I found that the sound was quite good throughout most of the performances. The picture quality, however, did vary! Sometimes, especially in some of the London recordings, there are horizontal lines running across the screen. A big disappointment!<br /><br />Some extras make up for the missed recordings. (I was so disappointed that there's no video of The Who singing \\"Pinball Wizard! The book says the power generator blew and there apparently was no time to get enough power to record this part of The Who's performance.) For example, we see Joan Baez singing \\"Amazing Grace.\\" Good plus! You also get B. B. King performing \\"Why I Sing The Blues,\\" \\"Don't Answer The Door,\\" and \\"Rock Me Baby.\\" There is even an early appearance by Run DMC! Even more, there is newsreel coverage by the BBC at the beginning of DVD one and a documentary about how the funds from Live Aid were used to help the neediest.<br /><br />I especially like one reviewer's suggestion that there be a twentieth anniversary release of this set to add interviews and backstage footage (if any exists)! Great suggestion, Jeff!<br /><br />After all is said and done, this of course is not the perfect DVD of a rock concert. Then again, the overall quality is still very good--you get 10 hours of nonstop, awesome rock bands giving everything they had to entertain and help people in desperate need. Despite its shortcomings, I still recommend this DVD set. It's a lot of fun to watch and it is far, far better than the nothing we had before! GRINrizontal lines running across the screen.

6304711905|5.0|If I could give this more stars I would.  Tombstone was brilliant.  Let me say right off the bat though, the love story part of the film really slowed things down for me.  This film focuses not only on the feud but also on the friendship between these men.   <br /> <br />Kurt Russell (as Wyatt Earp) gave a fine performance.  Val Kilmer who portrays Doc Holliday was robbed of an Oscar.  What he did with the role was nothing short of amazing. He actually stole the show in some scenes.  The costuming was very good as well.   <br /> <br />I don't even like westerns and I don't remember how I came to view Tombstone in the first place.  I'm so glad I did. <br /> <br />Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp is just a waste of time.  You need not  bother with that thing. <br /> <br />Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Robert Burke, Sam Elliot, Stephan Lang, Bill Paxton, Billy Zane, Terry O' Quinn were all very well cast for this film.  There are also  suprise cameo appearances by Charlton Heston and Billy Bob Thorton (a bit heavier then).  Sly Stallone's  brother also has a small role. <br /> <br />Just a note for those that may not understand what happens in the Doc Holliday death scene.  Near the beginning of the film, one of the Wyatts brothers mentions that he read an article that said when some people die they see a bright light leading them to heaven.  Just before his death, Doc asks Wyatt to leave his bedside because he knows the end is near and he doesn't want his friend to see him die.  After Wyatt leaves, Doc looks down at his body and says, \\"This is funny.\\"  In other words, he sees the light of heaven.  It is reported by some historians that Doc did indeed say \\"This is funny\\" just seconds before he died.  Some say that the reason he said it is because he always thought that he would die in the heat of a gun battle, not sick in bed.   <br /> <br />Point of interest:  When Wyatt's brother dies however, he sees no such light. <br /> <br />If you love the western genre, this film should have an honored place in your collection. <br /> <br />Parental Advisory:  I advise a viewing age of at least 13.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|On \\"Me & Mr. Johnson\\", Eric Clapton pays homage to one of his early influences, Robert Johnson.  I think Clapton does an excellent job and I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to this CD. I agree with all of the \\"blues purists\\" (a.k.a. A blues fan with his head stuck up his ass) that try as he might, Clapton is no Robert Johnson. DUH!  If this CD gets 5 people interested in roots music and away from the hip-hop, alternative, hardcore trash that passes for \\"music\\" nowadays, then I think Mr. Clapton should consider it a resounding success.  If you liked \\"From The Cradle\\" and/or \\"Riding With The King\\" then you shouldn't be disappointed with this disc. <br /> <br />NOTE TO ALL \\"BLUES PURISTS\\":  If you are such a \\"purist\\" then why would you bother to buy a CD (You shouldn't even own a CD player if you are a real, authentic, true, dyed in the wool blues purist)of a skinny English WHITE BOY playing covers of the legendary Robert Johnson. You should already own, as I do, a well worn copy of Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings and therefore have absolutely no use for this...CD.

B0006399FS|5.0|I've decided that his album, after listening to it a few times, is just great.  Anyone who hates the title hasn't thought about it yet.  It's perfectly fitting for the content.  It's has awesome songs that rock out, make you dance, make you cry, make you smile, and make you wanna change the world.  I highly recommend it.
B0002SROSQ|4.0|This is a very solid release by Nick Cave, much more so than the rushed 'Nocturama'. That was a particulary sluggish album, both lyrically and musically, and it was not surprising Cave himself dismissed it as a \\"rushed work\\" recently in an interview with the Sunday Times Magazine in Western Australia. <br /> <br />Here though, on The Lyre/Abattoir, it shows he's put a lot of work and pride into the album. I had the privilege of meeting Martin P. Casey, the bassist for the Bad Seeds, at a friend's party recently here in Northbridge in Perth WA, and Mr. Casey said that out of all the albums Nick Cave has released, this is the one that Nick is the most proud of. <br /> <br />It shows up in the music. There's some excellent tracks, each beautifully arranged with the help of a gospel choir, like 'Get Ready for Love', 'There She Goes, My Beautiful World' and 'Messiah Ward'. Each song, as per usual with Nick Cave, takes a few listens to get into. 'Nature Boy', for instance, sounds a bit dull at first, but after repeated listens it works its subtle melody into your head. The wonderful 'Babe, You Turn Me On' plays like a trademark Cave ballad; 'Easy Money' grows and grows on you; and 'Abattoir Blues', with its heavy beat and thumping chords, builds momentum nicely over 3 1/2 minutes. <br /> <br />The only misses on the album, in my opinion, are 'The Fable of the Brown Ape' and 'The Lyre of Orpheus'. These are really only \\"one-listen\\" affairs, because musically they're quite sparse, and lyrically aren't worth revisiting very often. So, half a star off for those two. <br /> <br />The rest of it though is wonderful. If you are a Nick Cave fan it will long be a staple in your playlist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0670033693|5.0|I'm not generally a fan of mysteries, and to call this a mystery is something of an injustice, but this is truly a terrific read. The characters are brought to life in such a beautifully genuine way that you actually CARE about these people, and that gives it relevance. You want to know what's going to happen next not simply because you think you can figure out \\"who done it\\" but because these characters become important to you. Perhaps one of the most striking things about the book is that it provides a view of what life is like in much of the Rocky Mountain region that isn't entirely what is expected. Both majestic and gritty at the same time the imagery is crystal clear and one of the things we learn is that justice is sometimes not the heroic ideal we would hope it to be. This was one of those books that you hate to finish, because you hope you can keep on reading it. Highly recommended!
0375422889|5.0|the persepolis books (I & II) are more than the life of an iranian girl told in comic form; they're also the story of an artist finding her self in a globalized society. marjane satrapi saw the worst of the islamic revolution as a child, and eventually her parents sent her to convent school in vienna to escape. but from the brittle moralisms of the nuns to the ban on nude models in art classes, marjane makes it more than apparent that the west doles out more than its share of senseless, self-serving rules and regulations.<br /><br />satrapi wrings every bit of irony, humor, and pathos out the combination of first person narration and graphics. her characterizations are always clear but never cliched and her break-neck narrative style (growing 2 feet in three small frames) depends on both text and graphic for meaning. most importantly we are watching the artist learn how to become an artist, looking at the development not only of a singular spirit but also of a globalized sensibility. satrapi owes as much to iranian storytelling as she does to western graphic art, and it's no surprise that her books (like most comics) are easily translated and easier to digest in translation.<br /><br />if satrapi's form travels well, her narrative travels even better. frame by frame, page by page, satrapi struggles first to do what she wants and then just to survive. between the crummy boyfriend and the marijuana smoke, the informers and the morality police, a self takes shape. part western teenager, part islamic mystic, satrapi is a true hybrid, something entirely different than her antecedents. her story is not about east or west, north or south, pictures or words, but about integration; the struggle of every young person caught between innnocence and the hate machines we know as political structures. a portrait of the artist without borders, persepolis II is its own war on terror, fought with pen and ink and dedicated to brave hearts and free spirits everywhere.

B00000J2SR|5.0|I was first introduced to Ritchie Blackmore through this CD, and it remains one of my favorites. This shows Ritchie and Joe Lynn Turner's songwriting skills at their height - a height, unfortunately, that Blackmore has sadly not surpassed since.  <br /> <br />This is a dark album - almost all the songs here are written in minor keys, so there's a menacing atmosphere throughout the release. It starts off with the ominous, charging riff of \\"Stranded,\\" in which Joe Lynn Turner's vocals are damn near operatic, a performance he repeats masterfully on the powerful \\"Can't Let You Go.\\" This is a GREAT song - from the classical, horror-film organ intro to the sweeping chorus.  <br /> <br />\\"Fool For the Night\\" is the closest the group treads to the pop-metal prevalent of this era (Loverboy, Def Leppard), but it's still enjoyable, if not a bit dated.  <br /> <br />\\"Fire Dance\\" is a vicious guitar and organ duel that's not quite speed metal, but it is ferociously fast. Not sure what the hell the lyrics are about, but one doesn't buy Rainbow albums for the poetry. That's what U2's for.  <br /> <br />\\"Anybody There\\" is a dark, dark instrumental that eventually gets lighter toard the end. Blackmore does some excellent soloing on the tune, and keeps it short, which is nice, 'cause it's one of the more depressing tracks on the CD. <br /> <br />\\"Desperate Heart\\" is good, melodic 80s pop metal, featuring a frantic, over-the-top guitar solo that ranks as one of Blackmore's best. Dave Rosenthal's keyboard flourishes are interesting, too - the closest the band ever comes to sounding like Prince (!) <br /> <br />\\"Street of Dreams\\" is a masterpiece, a moody song full of melody, great vocals from Turner and a killer chorus. One of the band's classics. If Rainbow could've stayed together and written more tunes like this, it would've ultimately been preferable to the damp squib the Purple reunion ended up being.  <br /> <br />\\"Drinking With the Devil\\" has a nasty riff that sounds like it bubbled out of a New Orleans swamp, and Turner does the album's best screaming on this track. Blackmore's solo is nice and aggressive, and the guitar break at the very end of the song is downright evil. In a nice way, of course. <br /> <br />\\"Snowman\\" is a beautifully eerie instrumental written by Howard Blake for an animated children's cartoon, of all things. With the Rainbow treatment, one is more apt to think of haunted Transylvanian castles than snowmen. Rosenthal's keyboards are truly haunting, and Blackmore's tortured solo is one of the album's best. This might be Blackmore's best instrumental ever. <br /> <br />\\"Make Your Move\\" gets panned by many fans, but it's really the only uptempo song on the album, and one of the fastest. It's the closest the band comes to sounding like AC/DC, and the cassette version, for whatever reason, contains an extended ending that features some searing guitar runs.  <br /> <br />This CD is the closest Rainbow sounds to being contemporary, whereas Blackmore and his Purple pals would release CDs in the 80s and 90s sounding hopelessly dated. History will hold \\"Bent Out of Shape\\" as an example of what could have been had Blackmore not succumbed to the lure of easy $$$ an ultimately futile Purple reunion would bring him.
B00068IOWC|5.0|It is a mix of all their 80s tunes with a flair of today's sound. But it is U2--they are not like all other artists out there. I was one of the young that was brought up on U2 because of my cousins who happened to be much older than me. What I learned from them was to appreciate the type of music that U2 made/makes and what it stands for. I am not at all disappointed by this album. U2 is the greatest band in the world now. Of all time? They are up there, but in my books, they are. I cannot tell you which songs are the best off this album. But I can tell you to listen to all of it and find what you like.
0385484518|5.0|\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is more than a book about living your live and appreciating it before your time is gone.  The book should remind readers of their mentor.  The person who saw that unfinished rock you were and made you into the beautiful gem you are.  The mentor that was Yoda to Luke Skywalker.  Some of us our forunate enough to have a great person lead us in the right direction.  I did too. <br /> <br />Much of the wisdom of this book has been stated in other ways in other books, but reading it from a format that you can identify with makes it more special.  The author, Mitch Albom, lives the hectic life of a man in the 1990's.  Only when he discovers his former professor and mentor is dying does he realize how has sqandered his life.  In Mitch Albom's \\"final thesis\\", he reaccesses his priorities through his discussions with his former professor, Morrie Schwartz.  Although Morrie has ALS, his days are brighten by the love from those around him.  What most people might see as terrible, Morrie sees through optimistic eyes thus teaching his former pupil. <br /> <br />We all have been where Mitch Albom begins in this book, having the wrong priorities.  Sometimes a person has to set us straight.  In one of his final gifts, Morrie Schwartz gave his former pupil another lesson.  This time, it was a beautiful life lesson.  You too can share in the beauty.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|The first time I heard this CD, I fell in love with it. \\"This is the band I've been waiting for!\\", I thought. I usually don't like all the screaming but vocalist M. Shadows has the best scream I have ever heard. I am a musician myself, and being a huge RUSH fan, I look for the diversity and originality in music. No song is the same on this album and if someone were to ask me my favorite song I would have to say all of them. This CD rocks!! The first time I heard the end of track seven, the guitar solo, I fell on the floor and started yellin YES! YES! because it just sounds sooooooooo good!!! <br />PICK IT UP!!!!
0802130208|4.0|populate a novel.<br /><br />One wonders how much O'Toole patterned his desperately comic hero after his own existence, prior to his suicide before the book was ever published.<br /><br />There is a wealthy of literary caricature here, along with the flavor of N'Awlins, complete with its colorful denizens.  Ignatius' run-in with the world of gays and lesbians at a consciousness-raising political rally he holds is a chapter of sheer insanity.<br /><br />Although I much preferred the quietly unique characters such as Officer Mancuso, and the love of Ignatius' life, the ornery Myrna, Ignatius and his mother are truly one of the most odd couples to ever grace the page of an American novel.  Always colorful and entertaining, Toole's novel delights, although, in my opinion, it fell short of what standard I believe should be achieved for a Pulitzer.<br /><br />Hundreds of reviewers can't be wrong - read \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", particularly if you've ever lived in the deep south!

What \\"U. Fire\\" did was foreshadow what U2 was set out to do--make good music that means something.

Like others, I was astonished by Brad Pitt's acting ability, which I had previously dismissed. Some reviewers asserted, however, that Pitt's performance was overdone. The interesting aspect to this accusation is that the film is highly stylized, and all of the other supporting actors are deliberately cartoonish - over-the-top by design. So are the supporting roles. If you single out Pitt for such criticism, you unwittingly reveal that you are close to believing him... even as he is playing a necessarily outrageous character that serves as antidote to an otherwise bleak dystopia.<br /><br />In college, I had a paranoid schizophrenic friend, and visited him a few times when he was institutionalized with others like him. Pitt must have studied these people. Not only does he have the right delusional intonations, he has the right quirky medicated movements too. He isn't just histrionically mad; he's _really_ mad. Overdone? I beg to differ! He's spot on.<br /><br />A number of reviewers have mentioned that the film should be viewed several times. More important in this context is that the film _can_ be viewed repeatedly with great enjoyment. Viewability is a rare quality in American cinema, and it is precisely the quality that makes 12 Monkeys a worthy addition to home video libraries.
B000002JNJ|4.0|There are plenty of people who are self-proclaimed \\"true metalheads\\"on the internet who like to discredit Pantera because they began as a glam metal band in the eighties.  Of course, these \\"true metalheads\\" can hide their hypocrisy sitting behind their computer screens since their tastes haven't been publicly documented over the years like Pantera's has.  Everybody changes their mind over the years.  It's a sign of having intellect.  If you like all the same things you did when you were 10 years old that may be a sign of mental retardation. <br />Pantera were like ex-smokers.  Once they found a better way, they were fully dedicated and passionate about the new direction their lives had taken.  Instead of breaking an addiction to nicotine, they broke their addiction to terrible music.  When they embraced thrash metal like ex-smokers embrace life without cigarettes, they wanted to play it as well as possible.  Pantera accomplished that mission and then some. <br /> <br />\\"Cowboys From Hell\\" sounds like four guys who want to make thrash metal as heavy as possible.  Take Metallica's `80's sound, throw out the progressive elements, ratchet up the heavy parts times ten, and you have this album. <br />Every song is full of galloping drums, sawing guitars, and chaotic energy.  Like on all their other classic albums, Pantera puts their best songs at the front of the album.  The title track is a street level, frenzied attack.  \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\" is the heaviest song on the album that will hammer a hole into anyone's skull.  \\"Psycho Holiday\\" is another menacing slab of doom.  \\"Cemetery Gates\\" is a ballad turned angry piece that uses the soft to loud dynamics perfectly.  \\"Domination\\" is one of the greatest songs in the Pantera catalog because of the often imitated, but never equaled, breakdown in the last half of the song. <br />The only weakness through the album is vocalist Phil Anselmo hits the falsetto high notes a wee bit too often.  However, on Pantera's next album,\\"Vulgar Display of Power,\\" Anselmo would fix that problem and stick with a drill sergeant style hardcore bark that would bring Pantera's sound together perfectly. <br /> <br />Pantera, along with Sepultura, would be one of the only bands to develop heavy metal in the `90's into something besides juvenile death metal and grindcore.  They kept thrash alive for a new generation of metal fans and never compromised despite the trends that surrounded them.  So, say what you want about Pantera, but they did more for heavy metal during the past decade than anyone else did.  <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|i am a huge U2 fan.  their dedication to making intelligent, emotional, pop/rock music that mattered fueled my unwavering support of bono and the boys through the 80s and 90s.  what they accomplished artistically and commercially in the transition from joshua tree/rattle and hum to achtung baby/zooropa was miraculously ambitious and successful.  it worked far better than i think anyone could have expected.  throughout all the style changes, the songs and the heart of the band stayed the same. <br /> <br />U2 screwed up with POP.  they have admitted they rushed the album to try and get it out before their tour.  the albums songs were a little weak, but i was impressed that they were still trying to make music that mattered - something unique and different.  the pop art/commercial trash theme of the album and subsequent tour were a let down from the previous intellectual highs of zoo t.v., but you can't be perfect all the time. <br /> <br />ATYCLB was an obvious attempt to regain popularity at the cost of sacrificing any serious ambitions as \\"artists\\".  It was an album where the first 4 songs were pop singles (albeit, good ones - except for that stupid, but catchy U2 retread Elevation song) and the rest of the song was b-side material.  I mean, give me a break, how can the song Grace not make you want to vomit - it's embarrassing to me as a U2 fan. <br /> <br />With Atomic Bomb, U2 wrote one good song, Vertigo.  I also like the Miracle Drug and Sometimes You Can't Make It, but they sound like something U2 has done before.  The rest of the album is not very good.  The songs show us nothing new.  They are not catchy or hummable.  It just sounds like bad U2 music - stuff that would have just not made the cut for any U2 album made between 1983 and 1998.  <br /> <br />I think that Bono has gotten a little bored with music and is not really concentrating on U2 as a band anymore.  In promoting the album, he talked about jetting in and out of Dublin to work on his humanitarian projects while Edge worked out all the songs mainly on his own.  I guess I don't blame the band for promoting their album and trying to make money, but I'm really sick of hearing the band and other people compare it to past great U2 albums - give me a break.  I pisses me off because I know they can't think that it's true so they must be lying to try and just get us to buy it....    like Bono says: we fans have given him a great life, so Bono: don't abuse the trust and give us crap albums and tell us they're good....  2 crap albums and you're out.  I'd say this album and ATYCLB make 1 and 1/2 crap albums - they're almost done (sadly).
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is a movie I wish I had seen earlier. I honestly don't even remember trailers during its theatrical release. But watching it for the first time I expected a violence-packed movie, nothing special. But this movie packs some deep and at times disturbing philosophy that will make you think about things. At the end of the movie it was instantly my favorite movie of all time. A lot of people share my opinion of Fight Club and some don't, finding it too extreme and disturbing to enjoy(and that opinion is okay too). <br /> <br />Edward Norton's unnamed character is a man living with everything he could want in life. He has the right dining sets that define him as a person, the right furniture that looks clever in his perfect little apartment. He goes to work and does his job well because is expected to. One day this man's lifestyle obsession leads to his ultimate realization that none of these things define him as a person and none bring him satisfaction in life. The 9-5 office job, his near-perfect wardrobe and his clever yin-yang designed coffee table become too much for him to bear. Insomnia takes its toll and to cope Norton begins attending support groups for people who really know what pain is. All is well until he meets Marlene Singer, another person who is faking her way through the support groups to cope with her own miserable life. Norton cannot deal with this so again he spirals back into insomnia. In comes Tyler Durden, a man that is everything Norton's character is not, and an alter-ego created to deal with the things that are unbearable for him. Tyler Durden says \\"All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I f*** like you wanna f***, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.  <br /> <br />I will say this. If you dont know already Norton's character and Tyler Durden are the same person. I know I just gave it away but the awesome twist in the end where that fact is revealed is not the important idea in this movie, rather what is important is how and why it occured. Tyler was there to deal with everything in Norton's life that he could not deal with on his own. His way of doing this was first off starting the fight club. Here, men were not who they were in the outside world. Most were working class men getting by with life in the way advertising tells you life should be spent. Advertising has you working a job you hate to get things you dont need and these things were not essential to man's survival. But in Fight Club you were a man not concerned with the outside world and the image that world labeled you with. Fight Club grew and it became a much larger idea, Project Mayhem. It is here that \\"Unnamed\\" begins to lose his own grip on reality and see things go too far when Tyler has essentailly built an army to terrorize the part of society that tells you to look like this and tells you to act like that.  <br /> <br />Fight Club as I have stated is not everyones favorite movie and that is okay. You may disagree with its message and find its violence repulsive, but in my opinion it is a fascinating look into the human mind. Society really does shape us into people we should be to do things we don't always enjoy doing and people deal with it different ways(by accepting or rejecting the so-called lifestyle obsession). This is how one fictitious character dealt with it all. You can have many opinions on this film, but see it first and make your own opinion. It is a well-directed movie and features great acting performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. If this is one of your favorite movies then I suggest the 2 disc version if you can find it.
0792841344|1.0|A sinister tall man with incredible strength and yellow blood steals cadavers from the cemetery, shrinks them and transports them via a trampoline to a red planet where they become his slaves for reasons not made clear. Add in an annoying, snooping teenager, his handsome but wooden older brother and a plastic fly with glowing eyes and you have possibly, the lamest horror film ever made and definitely one of the most over-rated.<br /><br />After reading all of the positive reviews posted here, I did the unthinkable and purchased this film before  actually viewing it. What a big mistake. I am a BIG horror movie fan and my taste in horror films is not limited. My taste range from the classics- \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Poltergeist\\", \\"Halloween\\" to B-Movie favourites- \\"Zombie\\", \\"House by the Cemetery\\", \\"Ghost Story\\" but I have to be brutally honest, \\"Phantasm\\" has got to be the most boring movie I have ever seen. I have tried watching it on several occasions (my guess, over 15 times) and I cannot sit through it. It is a bore-fest and I cannot recommend it to anyone. I have to agree with Leanard Maltin's *1/2 review, but I think even he was being generous.<br /><br />The film's pace is agonizingly slow, the acting is stiff and uninspired, the story, laughable and the special effects are poor (however considering the film's budget, the effects are at times clever although not always successful). I personally don't have a problem with low budget horror films. As a matter of fact, some of my all time favourites are of the low budget kind but this film does not make any sense. It tries to be creative but the ideas are incoherent at best. The scene when the obnoxious kid is almost transported to the Red Planet via some vortex is so outrageously funny as is the scene with the incredibly unrealistic flying insect with the glowing eyes. I understand the film didn't have much of a budget and I will give some credit to the effects team since some of the effects came out very well (the scene when a man's face is drilled by a flying, silver sphere) but how can we ignore those lame scenes?<br /><br />The film (as evidenced by the reviews posted on this site) has a cult following but for those of you who are not fans, please view with caution as you may end up disliking it as much as I did. I have tried watching this turkey by myself sober, by myself drunk, with friends sober, with friends drunk, with family members sober, with family members drunk to no avail. I was told repeatedly to turn the thing off and put something else on.<br /><br />I know I will probably get about 100 unhelpful votes from the fans but so be it. This movie is bottom of the barrel and only good for a few unintentional laughs.<br /><br />Skip it people cause you have better ways to spend your money. If it's chills your looking for, you're better off watching an episode of \\"Fear Factor\\" cause you're just not going to find any here.e when a man's face is drilled by a flying, silver sphere) but how can we ignore those lame scenes?<br /><br />The film (as evidenced by the reviews posted on this site) has a cult following but for those of you who are not fans, please view with caution as you may end up disliking it as much as I did.

B0002XDODU|2.0|I am very disapointed in Rammstein. The facetious song 'Amerika' pissed me off. I want to shoot them for making it. It breaks my heart to see this excellent, one of a kind band sell out like this by bashing America... It's a shame... They bit the hand that feeds them... Totally un-glorious.
B0006399FS|5.0|After all the hype I was SOOOOO excited to listen to \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\".  I heard comparisons to \\"Achtung Baby\\" with vestiges of \\"Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Unforgettable Fire\\".  I was so hoping for a raw, hard-hitting, guitar-driven, edgy album.  I was SO disappointed when I heard how mellow and easy the songs were.      But to my surprise, I found myself haunted by the songs, especially \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" (which I believe will join the ranks as one of the best U2 songs ever written).  This album is dense.  Everytime I listen to it, I catch another layer of music or another idea occurs to me suggested by a bit of lyric.  This album is quickly becoming one of my favorite U2 albums.    I think the initial reviews created certain expectations by making comparisons with prior U2 works.  But there is no comparison.  U2 have never been at this place and time in their lives.  It would be ridiculous if they were still stuck in the place they were in 10 or 20 years ago.  This is an evolution even from \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", which is my least favorite and is far surpassed by this album.    While I also yearn for that raw edginess that once was U2, this album achieves what all of U2's other albums have done by giving us a snap shot of this time and this place in U2's evolution.  This album is not \\"in-your-face\\" confrontational; it is much more sophisticated than that.  It confronts you on a deep personal level.  And true to U2 form, these songs bring you to the highest high while simultaneously taking you to the lowest low.  In these songs, U2 have created genuine \\"soul music\\" in the way that only U2 can.   The masters are still at it.    (BTW, I remember the same kind of passionate, intense negative reviews when (1) \\"October\\" came out because people compared it to \\"Boy\\" and (2) \\"Achtung Baby\\" came out because it was compared to \\"Joshua Tree\\".  And what are people saying now about these albums?)
B00005JMAH|4.0|True Harry Potter fans will probably complain that this film follows the book too loosely, but that won't stop them from purchasing the DVD.  Like Star Trek fans before them, a movie that is slightly off the mark will not make them break the series.<br /><br />This is not such a bad trait, because \\"slightly off the mark\\" as this film is, it is a great addition to the series.  Harry finally gains a family member that is worth having, the twists and turns are complex, and the end is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  Add all of this together and mix in a group of children who have grown into teens with attitudes and you have a blockbuster film.  Children do grow up and the slight tendencies of youth become more defined in adolescence.  The film plainly and delightfully shows this happening.
B0002Z1EG2|1.0|Shania, Tim M, Faith, and all the other \\"country artists\\" have ruined country music. Each one of them is responsible for commiting murder down on music row. If you want legit female country music, listen to an old Tammy Wynette CD. We need to turn country music back into country music. Shania and all her contemporaries have ruined country music. Too bad that all one needs now a days is good looks to get a recording contract. Where would that have put Waylon if he was to sign today? Would the late great Patsy Cline been good looking enough? If not and she was around today I doubt we would have ever heard of her because she is just average  looking. And no don't tell me that todays country music is different--just listen to it. It realy isn't country music anymore save for a few artist such as George Strait. Please bring back countrt music the way it used to be and get rid of all the fakeness of country.
B00005JLEX|5.0|First off, I am a huge Seinfeld fan, I have over 300 collectible items from the show including a piece of stage from the Marv Griffen set, and the original numbers off of Jerrys apartment, I have over 150 autographs from the cast and crew, so from all of this you can tell that I am a fan. I purchased the entire Series off of ebay some time ago only to be most disappointed with the quality and the commercials which were included!!! <br />Today I picked up the seasons 1,2,3 and am most satisfied with the quality but most of all I absolutely all of the bonus footage, the interviews are absolutely great, and any Seinfeld fan knows that there simply just are not enough of these interviews, however most of all I love the bloopers that are included, they're absolutely HILARIOUS!!! and very rare indeed. Of course you can not go wrong with the episodes that are digitally remastered and sound wonderful. The season 1-2 set included the very rare Pilot episode titled\\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\" which I personally have only had the pleasure to see one other time from the set I purchased from ebay. <br />This is a sure buy for any Seinfeld fan whether large or small. I truly can not say enough about these two sets. I have a very large DVD collection with over 350 DVDs and over 500 recorded DVDs(I have a DVD Burner). I can honestly say that Seinfeld Seasons 1-3 are in my top 5 DVDs, and were worth absolutely every singly penny and more!  <br />Go out and buy these 2 sets, you will thank me later. Get them for Christmas, or Hannakuh or any other way possible, JUST GET THEM however you may. Trust me it is worth all the wait and hype. Best collection to date in my opinion. <br />Thank you Columbia Tri-Star for releasing these You have saved my Seinfeld collection and I can finally resell my ebay purchased Set. I simply do not need it anymore since these are finally being legally released. <br />Buy These 2 Sets, You will cherish every singly moment!
B000002TQV|3.0|I know that this may get some die-hard fans pretty angry, but I find Radiohead's The Bends to be a mediocre and bland album. I just can't understand why there's so much hype over it...it seems overrated. Instrumentally, Radiohead is pretty good (like in Street Spirit) but vocally....yikes. The vocals really tend to get on my nerves throughout the entire album because, quite frankly, they can be really \\"whiny\\" and annoying as someone else has already said. The only two songs that I find to be \\"ok\\" and worth listening to on this album are Street Spirit, and Fake Plastic Trees.  <br /> <br />Another thing I can't understand is how you can compare Radiohead, to a spectacular and phenomenal band like Pink Floyd. Sure, Radiohead has been influenced by the music of Pink Floyd, but you just CAN'T compare the two. Radiohead does not even come close to the breathtaking, artistic and quality music that the guys from Pink Floyd have created.  <br /> <br />My rating: 3/5  <br /> <br />
0679882820|5.0|Very entertaining and short Dr Suess book. My 3 year old loves it. She can't sit still for the longer books.
0743529782|4.0|I really enjoyed this book on tape as read by the author.  This tale of her life before and after a brutal rape was candid and harrowing.  I think that this is an important subject that is too often overlooked and that Sebold did an excellent job narrating her own story.  I would recommend this to any of my female readers.
1401301010|2.0|Anthony details his daily search for drugs, going over a period of about 20 years.  In between the drugs, he has these girlfriend relationships that are similar to the ones we had in 9th grade - pledging our \\"one-ness\\" and having a lot of male-gratifying sex. <br /> <br />They say that drug and alcohol addiction \\"freezes\\" the maturity of the addict to early teen years, and this book is pure proof of it. <br /> <br />I like Anthony - he's not a bad guy - and I hope he will now focus on writing, working and helping others, as well as staying sober, and hopefully, through the process, go from 14 to 40. <br /> <br />I just wish I had half of the money he spent on drugs...ugh, what a waste of success... <br />
1592220053|3.0|Again people giving reviews of this book because they like The Song of Ice and Fire.  I can't imagine that they really found this to be 5 star material.  Would GGRM even give himself 5 stars for this.   <br />The character of Tuf is cleverly written and the situations and his solutions to them are witty and humurous, but not great. <br />
630460288X|5.0|This is a fan-freakin'-tastic sci-fi about a futuristic fascist government ruled by an evil despot \\"Big Brother\\" who recruits a violent gang leader from the 20th century to assassinate the leader of the resistance who lives underground where the despot cannot monitor him. The problem is that the despot cannot control the gangster who wreaks even more havok now than he did in the past. The police decide to recruit a tough 20th century cop to go after the 20th century gangster, but the cop has a hard time fitting in and following the ludicrous laws of the future. The action and the humor get really good from there.
0440242576|5.0|Absolutely hilarious story line.  Is this not the book that the movie \\"Christmas With The Kronks\\" is based on?  I read the book last Christmas and loved it and now the movie is out! The book's humor is something everyone who has ever lived the typical suburbia lifestyle can relate to. It's a book to read and re-read every Christmas season!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie definitely isn't for everyone, but I think it's hilarious. My friend Stacy and I were practically crying laughing when we first watched this. I've seen it several times since then and it always cracks me up.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is a riot in this - as is Owen Wilson. If you usually get a kick out of these two actors, then you'll probably get a major kick out of Zoolander.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Johnny Depp has never been an actor to do \\"mainstream\\" movies, with the exception of Pirates of the Caribbean.  The same holds true for Finding Neverland, which has a feel of an independent movie.   <br /> <br />The story takes place in 1903 and is about author J.M. Barrie (Depp) and how he became inspired to write the play \\"Peter Pan.\\"  Basically he was at the park and met the Davies Family.  Sylvia (Kate Winslet) is the mom/widow of the family whom has four boys that she is responsible for.  James begins the hang out with the family on a regular basis.  He plays cowboys or pirates with the boys.  As he does this, he writes down all of his ideas and images, which eventually turns out to be \\"Peter Pan.\\"   <br /> <br />Johnny Depp gaves an amazing performance.  I really hope that he gets his long over-due Oscar for this performance.  Everytime that he is in a movie, he makes it a better.  He is the perfect person to play the role of a grown man who doesn't want to grow up.  Kate Winslet also gives a good, dramatic performance.  Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman are also featured in this film and due well for having limited roles.   <br /> <br />The movies itself was really good.  It seems like the kind of movie that would get boring, but it actually didn't.  I was very interested in the movie the whole way through.  Marc Forster did an excellent job of directing this movie.  I especially like how he showed what James is thinking in his imagination.  Also the way the recreation of the original \\"Peter Pan\\" play is something to see.  Forster definately did his homework on the original \\"Peter Pan\\" play.   <br /> <br />So my recommendation is the check this movie out.  It is a very entertaining movie, that provides you with a good message.  Imagination is the greatest gift of all and to always try to find and keep alive the inner child in you.  Thats a great message, but just don't take it to Michael Jackson levels.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Yes, Equilibrium is, overall, a terribly derivative movie (1984, Farenheit 451, etc.) but it contains some truly original concepts and moments.   <br /> <br />One of director Wimmer's real masterstrokes is the sequence in which the villain DuPont carefully explains the theory behind the Gun Kata - in terms just plausible enough to allow the audience to accept the stunning action choreography.  It's a seductive idea, beautifully executed by stunt choreographer Jim Vickers in all the action sequences.  <br /> <br />Another particular highlight is the leadup to the final confrontation between Preston and his nemesis, played by Taye Diggs.  Wimmer has carefully established their rivalry to the point where the audience is salivating to see them go head to head ... then he surprises us with a twist ... then stuns us with ANOTHER twist that is, in itself, one of the most original applications of fight choreography I've ever seen. <br /> <br />
B000001IPL|5.0|this, along with 'ignition' is definitely the offsprings best.  its the perfect hard/punk/rock/whatever album.
B000021YQV|4.0|I was down in L.A. going to Azusa race park when I passed a huge crowd of a crap load of people. I stopped by and say that SoaD was having a concert inside a motel called, sunrise or something....i forgot, anyways it was a pretty cool concert. Also the video shoot for \\"chop suey\\" took place their you can see the motel in the background of the video. The motel is actually right in front of a 99cents store. Oh and surrounded with gay homelesses.(j/k!)
B0000634EV|5.0|Down is breathtaking. Phil's vocals are so smooth yet gruff at the same time. He is amazing. The guitars are downtuned and distorted. This is a good stoner album. Many of the songs are trippy (Check out Track 15) Just a solid album, unlike anything else. Picture Sabbath and Pantera and Zeppelin together. Can't Miss!! Killer recording
B000007U6V|5.0|My father used to play this a hell of a lot and of course I had to buy this (via import at the time) about 15 years ago now. I still have it on vinyl as well :-) <br />Truly a great album and I still listen to it even nowdays (2004), to be honest I'm not keen on the other tracks so I only play 22 mins of Autobahn - it always reminds me of the times when I went to Germany ... buy this you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />Sidenote : When I bought my first Home Cinema System to test out the \\"bass\\" - I played Autobahn - it shook the windows - magic ! <br />

B000002I25|5.0|~\\"\\"The End\\". This was one that broke all the chains of morality in music underscored in Satanism, and the Odepus Complex. Not even the Fugs, the Beatles, the MC5, or the Velvet Underground would touch this one. It was rumored that Morrison had all the lights in the recording studio turned off, and lit a bunch of candles, and when they finished recording this song he poured blood all over the console.\\"~  -D.R. Hayes <br /> <br />Well, first of all, if there were such things as 'chains of morality in music', the song \\"The End\\" wouldn't have 'broke them all'.  The End is NOT Satanic.   <br /> <br />The Oedepus complex was rooted in ancient Greek mythology of the gods. There was NO Satan involved in this mythology, nor in the song 'The End'.  Sure there are dark overtones in the way Jim sings the song, the lyrics, and the nature of the music, but Jim was neither Satanic or Pagan (ie \\"Morrison had all the lights in the recording studio turned off, and lit a bunch of candles, and when they finished recording this song he poured blood all over the console\\")   <br /> <br />That was made up by ignoramus' who romanticised over Jim's (non existent) 'Satanism' and cult appeal. Come on now, let's get our facts straight before we write an erroneous review.
6302891272|5.0|Throne of Blood is Kurosawa's variation on Shakespeare's Macbeth. Kurosawa takes the framework of Macbeth, but films it in, medieval Japan, a completely different setting. The major alternation of the setting and language makes it more Japanese legend than Shakespearean. Shakespeare's language is lost; however, it is worthwhile exploring Kurosawa's interpretation of Macbeth.        In Throne of Blood, Macbeth's character is over dramatized. Toshiro Mifune takes the tragic role of Macbeth, the pitiful hero who deliberately abandons loyalty and conscience in order to take the position of a king, who then faces a progressive downfall until he is destroyed at last. The superfluous actions and facial expressions of Mifune seem to substitute the barrenness of the script. In view of the script, language does not take a paramount role as it does in Shakespeare's plays, but is merely the means to maintain the bare plot of Macbeth.       In contrast to the somewhat exaggerated characterization of Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is utterly expressionless. She brings about an air of composure and coolness, a nature quite ironic in a character like Lady Macbeth; she is a ruthless and an ambitious woman who readily sells her peace to the hands of evil in order to have her husband the king. However, Isuzu Yamada, who portrays her, does not express this. Although Kurosawa's characterization of Lady Macbeth contradicts her corrupt nature, it is excusable when taking into consideration the cultural aspects of Japan. Its feudal society devoted to pursue high discipline and courtesy contributed to the reserved and reticent nature of Japanese men and women in particular.        There are major plot differences from the film and play. In the original version of Macbeth, Shakespeare does not show why Macbeth is unable to succeed his thrown to his children. Kurosawa attempts to explain this. In Throne of Blood, the baby between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is born dead. Although this remains as a minor part of the play, it inflicts a greater tragedy.       Kurosawa also rewrites the climax. Macbeth's death is portrayed as being more pitiful than heroic. Shakespeare characterizes Macbeth as a tragic hero. Kurosawa does not. Macbeth does not die heroically fighting against his enemy, but is defeated by his own army that had turned against him. At last, Macbeth, stricken by arrows, drops helplessly in front of the watchful eyes of his men. Thus, Macbeth is depicted as a corrupt king who stands feebly against his fate like the sand before a strong blow of wind.       Kurosawa reiterates the great tragedy of Macbeth. This movie is highly recommended to all movie fans, especially to those devoted to Shakespeare's plays.
B00025ETIW|5.0|my chemical romanc is a vry goo band...i liked their last album a little mor but i still listen the three cheers for sweet revenge all the time....i nver listene to post-punk or goth music but my taste in music has a changd a lot after listening to this band....
B00068IOWC|5.0|After listening this album again and again I love all songs !!    <br />Just put the headphones on and dive in..........you'll love it. <br /> <br />Who from U2 fans say this album failed does not really understand  who U2 are ! <br /> <br />This whole thing is BRILLANT , buy it you won't regret it !!!! <br />
B0002IVN9W|4.0|What can I say?  I love this album.  I generally like music that makes me feel something when I hear it.  I'm not looking for what's new, hot, underground, indie, etc.  I am just a music fan with a great ear for music, and this moves me.  It has that indie rock feel to it, but surpasses the \\"members-only\\" connotation associated with a lot of newer indie bands.  It really connects.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|after reading reviews and after having the opportunity of actually seeing this concert, i am very pleased and i think  <br />everyone will be. there is the one exeption of the bonehead <br />that wants every single artist and song available to the public. <br />i guess he needs the whole show so he can dance with his air <br />guitar pretending that the show is about him. well, the song <br />and artist list is wonderful. i guess some critics seem to forget that while paul macartney was singing \\"let it be\\", the <br />sound from his microphone was not feeding to the tv sets across <br />the world. in closing, buy this, enjoy this, it is something to <br />share with your children, and it is for a wonderful cause.
0395389496|5.0|Any one should enjoy reading the Polar Express to any children. It can be a great gift for any child to start the holiday tradition of packing and unpacking lots of products as early as June, and turn that child into a great spender and consumer as soon as possible. However while reading this book a child can dream about the Christmas decorations, reading non-stop about imaginary Santa arriving on Christmas Eve while lots of his peers have not even a slice of bread on their tables, starving from hunger. It is an exciting book to brainwash your child and turn it into a little selfish monster.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I was so excited when I heard about the live DVD. Evanescence is my favorite band, and I couldn't wait to see one of their live concerts on DVD, and all the extra material.  <br /> <br />This DVD is amazing. The live concert is awesome. There are some weird camera angles and odd effects used, but the overall experience is great. Breathe No More is one of the most beautiful songs that they do live, in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Then there's the behind-the-scenes material. It shows that Amy and the guys are funny, goofy and a bit dorky, and it's just hilarious to watch them. There's also a bloopers section, which is extremely funny as well. To anyone who still thinks that these guys are dark, brooding, and depressed, this will put that thought out of your head. It's great to see how down-to-earth everyone is. <br /> <br />The four music videos are also included, which is awesome. The quality is amazing; each video is very sharp and clear. (it's also nice to see the video without the logo of MTV or FUSE in the corner) <br /> <br />Any die-hard fan will love this DVD. I've watched it multiple times already and I can't get enough of it! I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the band.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This collection appears to have everything, and I mean EVERYTHING a Matrix fan could want.  December 7th just can't come fast enough for me. <br /> <br />And to the person who was asking about the music in the promotional video on thematrix.com, the first track used is a snippet of the track Spirit of the Universe.  You can find it about 90 seconds into that track  A beautiful little requiem by Don Davis.
B000669GAI|5.0|This is the highly anticipated `Greatest Hits' package from the longest surviving and arguably best group of the famed, early 90's `Seattle Grunge Triangle' - completed by Nirvana and Soundgarden. With eight studio albums and a seemingly endless amount of live recordings and bootlegs, cutting it down to a double disc collection must have been the hardest job since Michael Jackson's publicist. Whether or not everything you like appears, they are certainly the most approachable 33 tracks. They're all here; the three massive singles from `Ten', the screeching `Do The Evolution', the gorgeously constructed `Daughter', the haunting yet radio friendly `Better Man' and `Last Kiss', right up to the self assured brilliance of `I Am Mine' off their last album. Does it get much better than this? Well the PJ purists will no doubt argue for whatever they see as the biggest injustices - but it is interesting to note, that from the album `No Code' - commonly regarded as the bands most diverse and satisfying start-to-finish release, only three tracks made the cut. But alas I'm trying to pick-a-part perfection. The only better way to enjoy Pearl Jam is with an 8-CD box set, but this is more than enough for now.

And no, I'm not trying to say that Avril fans are poseurs because I understand that some people just like their own type of music. And that's ok. It's normal. However, this album is dumb. There's one word for this album, DUMB. You don't wanna bring down your IQ to the size of your shoe just to listen Avril Lavigne do you? Well that's your decision to make of course... <br />But I must tell you that Avril does not appreciate her fans. Why? Because she thinks that she's unique, she thinks she's as &#34;punk&#34; as they come remember? She doesn't want her fans dressing like her nor does she want them to dress like Britney Spears, because even though those same fans who she rejected to give her autograph to that most likely shop Abercrombie and Fitch (the place she hates) are probably the ones that helped her get as famous as she is now. According to Avril she gets &#34;more famouser&#34; everyday. &#60;-See what I mean. Don't you want an idol who would actually like you if you met them and not judge you by your clothes. Don't you wanna support someone who at least knows that the word &#34;famouser&#34; isn't a word? Come on you can do better than that!
B0006399FS|3.0|It's hard to argue that U2 aren't the greatest band of the last 20 years. They've filled many an arena, sold well over 100 million albums and have almost as many awards and honours. And you know what, they're still churning out the LP's. 2000's `All That You Can't Leave Behind' was followed by a second greatest hits package, which to most was a sign that they weren't far from checking out. But Bono and the boys have returned with a collection that apparently `is a step back to their old days'. While there is evidence of the earlier sound in the tracks `Miracle Drug' and `City Of Blinding Lights', it seems more like a clich new album quote. That's not to say it isn't a good listen, it's exactly what you would expect from U2. There's no surprises here so depending on how you look at the group will determine what you get out of this full-length. It's solid in every aspect and there are a few tracks that will make `Best Of Volume 3' (`All Because Of You', City Of Blinding Lights', `Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own'), but there is certainly no `Sunday, Bloody Sunday' or `Pride'. There isn't even a standout similar to `Elevation' or `Electrical Storm' from their more recent work, so save your pennies. But don't worry about the Irish lads - there's no doubt half the planet will buy this album just because it's U2.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I'd give it no stars if I could - absolute crap, could have written the script when I was 10.  Maybe worth it for 3 good seconds of actual flying footage.

B00009V7T2|5.0|If an album can be perfect in every sense of the word, this is that album.  The music can not be accurately described as being in any genre.  It is totally original and unique.  This may not be the kind of music the casual listener will enjoy, however.  The songwriting is complex at times, but that's what makes it so interesting.  I can't just put this cd in and play one song.  It's an experience that deserves a \\"start to finish\\" listening every time.  I don't think Omar could write a bad song if he tried.  Cedric's lyrics and vocals are nothing short of amazing.  I've got the de-loused lyric book as well, and it's worth every penny if you can find it.  If you love music and the art of creating it, you can't be without this album. De-loused in the Comatorium is powerful and engaging.  Perfect.
B0006399FS|2.0|First off I'm a big U2 fan. They are easily one of the greatest bands ever. But this new direction they have gone is just plain boring. I thought it was kind of cool that they went back to their roots for ATYCLB. To try it again though is just lame. This was a band that used to reinvent itself with every new release. Now instead of something new and cutting edge we get this. Only two songs are anything close to uptempo. Those two being Vertigo and All Because Of You. Other songs like City of Blinding Lights and One Step Closer sound like generic Joshua Tree B-Sides. The cd as a whole has this weird manufactured feel about it. Like they were so concerned about writing radio friendly pop songs that they completely lost track of the true direction of the band. Maybe they are just really scared to fail. But hey even when they did fail in the past at least you could respect them for trying something different. Possibly the worst part about this album is that The Edge is rarely able to show off his enormous talent. One of the greatest guitar players ever is completely wasted on this album. On a whole it's not bad music compared to the other crap out their today. But to the people who have followed this band for more than 20 plus years it's almost depressing.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I can sum up \\"Once More With Feeling\\", as a rare gem in the history of television.  An Original engaging musical.  The Best songs are \\"Under Your Spell; I'll Never Tell; Something to Sing about.  As for the complaints:  Sarah Michelle Gellar has a wonderful voice.  There aren't any misses as far as I'm concerned.  Joss Weadon's score is imaginitive, and although he got ideas from other sources, I feel it is original enough to be his own.  I find myself whistling these catchy tunes. <br />Well done!
1593081081|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.ust a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

B0000894RZ|5.0|Lisa Stansfield career cannot be sum in just one cd, this woman holds such talent that hurts.  Her 1997 self titled release was and is one of the most classy and soulful ever to be release.  So I'm sad that this collection not feature all the singles released from that album, specially \\"I'm Leavin'\\".  Although for a casual fan and a pop collector this Biography will do good and it is a place to listen to her most mainstream hits and some fans favorites.  Five Stars to Stansfield's voice and contribution to music industry.
B000024D4R|5.0|For some odd reason, this album is one of Pink Floyd's least appreciated and least successful albums. Too bad. Animals is a masterpiece, and one of Pink Floyd's best ever. Like most of Pink Floyd's albums, it is unique and different from anything you have ever heard before.  <br /> <br />Dogs is by far the best piece of the album. Not only are the lyrics brilliant, but the guitar solo may be Gilmour's best. The guitar is raw, real, and at some points it sounds as if Gilmour actually makes it \\"cry\\". Like all masterpieces (e.g. Echoes), it is very long and contains a \\"dead\\" segment in the middle.  <br /> <br />Pigs is also great, culminating in a beautiful segment of guitar and synthetic pig oinks that merge together in perfect harmony. A great work of \\"synthetic\\" music.  <br /> <br />Sheep is O.K., but far from being as good as the other two pieces. <br /> <br />Overall, one of Pink Floyd's best and a true, unique masterpiece.     <br />

C'mon, don't be so fan.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is on my short list of greatest films.  It shows a respect for humanity that is all too rare in our culture.  Any author or artist willing to risk the silences and the slow, patient rhythms of real life should recieve a badge of courage.  To people who have forgotten what it's like to live without the constant presence of quick-cut mass-media, well...just read what they say in the negative reviews of this movie: they just don't get it.  This movie is like a brilliant dream unfolding on the country roads crossing the prairie.  Highest praises to David Lynch.
B0006284JQ|5.0|It seems that most of the negative reviews on this site have more to do with the reviewers personal views of Britney and her personal life than the album itself.  I was just recently converted to a Britney fan with the \\"In the Zone\\" album.  Truly one of the best and under appreciated pop albums of the year.  I, like many others thought it was way too soon for a greatest hits album.  After all most of the songs on her first two albums sounded exactly the same.  I was pleasantly surprised by this collection.  There are some really great pop songs here. Her music may not be deep or win any grammys but it's just fun to listen to these songs. They make me smile and just feel good.  How many artists can say that?
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This is one of the coolest albums I've ever listened to. I listen to it like once a day, and I'm blown away every time. <br />From the creepy noises of 762427000017 (whatever it is) you know you're in for a ride here. (SiC), Eyeless, Wait and bleed, surfacing and Spit it out are all REALLY awesome songs, with a compilation of metal, strange effects and rap. The album starts to slow down after this, but its still great because Me Inside and Liberate are cool also. <br />Since I own the digipack, there's lots of bonus songs like the super-fast Spit it out and a remix of Wait and bleed, and bonus songs like Interloper and Despise which are cool too. The album ends with a live version of Spit it out, which is really cool too. The bonus track which starts at 10:01 on the last track is also worth listening. <br /> <br />You can't lose with this album, even for non-metal fans because this was my first real metal cd.
B000002H97|2.0|I remember way back when.. this album was released. <br /> <br />The decision to go with Bob Rock.  The absence from the studio, the yet to be acceptance of Jason Newstead as the replacement bassist.  Boy things were never going to be the same again. <br /> <br />This was probably the ultimate turning point for this band in changing direction.  It's just that for the vast majority of fans who followed the band didn't expect that change to be so drastic. <br /> <br />The \\"black album\\" as it is called, is a heavily produced and slick sounding recording.  It sounds fantastic but the band dropped longer complicated metal patterns and meaningful lyrics, for shorter songs, simpler catchy riffs, and two obvious ballads. <br /> <br />You either favored this change, or hated it.  In the end I somewhere fell in between in this album mostly leaning to the dissapointing side because it lacks a huge amount of creativity in song writing and musical chops that Metallica was so famous for displaying. <br /> <br />It was definatly one of those albums I have had that sits in my collection and gathers dust.  If any other band had made this album it would have been VERY impressive, but the reality is it was done by the founding fathers of modern metal, who just seemed to be stomping and chucking up all their uniqueness out the window. <br /> <br />In the end other bands came in and filled that void and still do, and I can't remember the last time I pulled out a Metallica album to listen to in a VERY VERY long time.  And when I do pull out a Metallica album to listen to, it sure wont be this one.
0316168815|2.0|I hate to be the party pooper, but I have to say that I found this book extremely tedious and boring. The author seems to be on a quest to impress literary teachers by using words and phrases that no real person would use. (For example in at least two instances she refers to the evening as \\"evensong\\". The book starts in the year 1975 -- when that word would be considered archaic even then.) <br /> <br />If you're looking for a murder mystery, this book isn't for you. The author chooses to end the book in the most silly way -- by having an icicle fall on the perpetrator. It's as if the publisher phoned her and said \\"hurry up, we need your manuscript!\\" <br /> <br />The author's puffed-up writing style gets in the way of telling her story. Although I consider myself to be fairly well-read, I found myself having to re-read sentences several times before I knew what the author was trying to say. Sometimes, I never did figure it out, and just had to move on. <br /> <br />If you really want to read this book, check it out from the library. That way you'll only be out of a little time, and not money.

0385513755|2.0|DISCLAIMER:  I'm not Catholic and have little interest in the proclamations of organized religion.  That said, it greatly saddens me that The Da Vinci Code (TDVC) is the \\"hit\\" it is.  One of the central arguments made by the book is post-modern feminist and runs something along the lines of \\"the Catholic church ruined civilization by denying the female influence of our culture which they found threatening to spreading the gospel by men.\\"<br /><br />This is ludicrous and I'm conflicted that Brown's book has put me in a position to defend the Church!<br /><br />Brown's thesis assumes several things:  the last 2000 years of civilization is primarily a result of Western influences, and these influences started at the time of Jesus.  No mention is made of pre-Christian patriarchal western societies (Hebrew) or Asian patriarchal societies.  It's not like Christianity has been the only influence in the entire world affecting all cultures.  And sorry, no matter what nasty things that the Church has done (and the list is long, very long), I'm not going to blame it for a complete and total attack on women.  The fact is that in many present cultures (such as the Catholic societies of Central and South America) the genders do not clash nearly as much.  That the feminist movement of the 70's in the United States hasn't brought about domestic bliss for either gender is hardly the fault of the Church.  (Now if only the Church would come to grips with things like birth control, the world would be a happier place.)<br /><br />Brown further \\"astounds\\" the reader that secular leaders (such as the Roman Emperors) use religion as a means of cementing earthly powers.  I'm shocked!  Why, imagine if the United States had a President who very late in life becomes \\"born again\\" and then claims to be evangelical to justify a series of controversial decisions, doing \\"God's work\\" as it were.  Or is it cynical of me to bring that up?  The point is that religion has always been mixed up in secular politics and it is unfortunate that readers apparently see this as a new idea.  If people were less ignorant of the history of their religion, then secular leaders would less be able to manipulate religion for political ends (sort of like the situation we presently have in the United States).<br /><br />Lastly, the \\"deep\\" mathematics Brown discusses can all be found (and in a much better form) in a delightful movie \\"Donald Duck in Mathemagic Land\\".  No doubt that followers of TDVC will point out that this is Disney's attempt at spreading the gospel among the young.<br /><br />The structure of the story give false suspense by simply leaving out key bits of information at the author's whim.  The writing, as mentioned by previous reviews, has something to be desired.  The only interesting puzzles are solved tens of pages before the solution is revealed if one has even a passing knowledge of math, art, and Da Vinci.<br /><br />Compare this book to another wild best seller of 30 years ago:  The Godfather.  Despite the operatic feel, that book is one that is worthy of multiple readings (albeit at the beach).  It's hard to imagine one wanted to read The Da Vinci Code a second time.  Unlike, a mystery like, say, The Sting, where once the secrets are revealed, it is still enjoyable, TDVC evaporates when you know the plot line.<br /><br />If you want to use this book to spur your curiosity about a host of subjects (especially Da Vinci) by all means, indulge.  But you would be better off getting the above Disney movie, \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joe Campbell (so you can see how all religions tend to borrow from what is around them), and a decent art book.  The only good message that this book contains is that adults should not go around believing in fairy tales and myths as literal truth.

B0006399FS|5.0|\\"How to dismantle an atomic Bomb\\" is the perfect pop-rock record.  I am more of a fan of the 90's u2 albums like Acthung Baby and Pop but if you are still expecting this kind of stuff from the band you're not grounded in reality.  To be the biggest band in the world, which Bono loves to be, they have to be basically a pop band to get the neccessary airplay.  If you look at this album as a pop rock record, it doesnt get better.   <br /> <br />Of course, it has some great guitar rock songs on it like \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"All Because of You.\\"  Those are the two best songs on the new CD, along with \\"Miracle Drug.\\"  Time will tell if it is going to be a classic or not and will be still great in a couple years but right now its on constant play in my CD player.
B000268QB2|3.0|Keane's debut album \\"Hopes & Fears\\" is a solid debut.  It is good, but it is not great.  The album and songwriting are along the same vain as Travis and Coldplay.  All the songs are piano driven, but they lack the craftsmanship of Ben Folds.  I like the album, but is it as great some of the similar sounding albums of the last five years?  The simple answer is no.<br /><br />The Man Who was released by Travis five years ago. It is difficult to believe it has been that long.  Since that release Coldplay have released two albums, Radiohead tried to forget about rock n roll, and Travis have released two disappointing LPs.  Had Keane been released four years ago my opinion of this record would probably be different.<br /><br />Make no mistake there are some great songs on this album.  There are at least 5 songs that are worthy of great praise, but it is the rest of the album that meanders about aimlessly.  If you are huge fan of Travis and Coldplay and you do not like where music has gone the past two years (the killers, the strokes, interpol, the white stripes, ect.) you will probably like Keane.
6305718954|5.0|This particular movie is one of the more closer modern day films of the church secrets. You don't have to like this movie, but it does approach one of the biggest secret of the church: \\"What an actual church is\\". I personally like this movie, it is an intellectual film at heart. I agree that this shouldn't be compared to The Exorcist. That original movie has I think more rawness to it, this movie is slick, stylistic, and extremely methodical. I thought this to have the most disturbing imagery, next to the original hellrasier.
B0006399FS|2.0|Oh okay , Im U2 fan and a fan of music as well  . Its not easy being a fan of todays music industry! U2 no doubt is a fantastic band , and even on this album Adam, The edge and Larry have displayed their legendary talents with the guitar, drums and Bass. However, I have to say that I feel they're pretty much are stuck in a league of their own, which isnt appealing anymore. Music is part rythm, part lyric , part melody and part harmony (& about chord progressions etc) . It would be nice to see them not play it \\"safe\\" for a change , just like former Savage Gardens Frontman Darren Hayes latest solo Album \\" The Tension & the Spark\\" that speaks volumes about being musically evolved ( think Eurythmics), a far better musical triumph Ive so thoroughly enjoyed although it will not sell truckloads like U2 . Why ? hmm ... I have to say with regret that U2 as a brand have become larger than the music!
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 has done it again with Adam's booming bass, The Edge's unforgettable guitar sound, Larry's fast, slick drumming, and the voice and lyrics that could only come from Bono. It kicks off with the rocker that everyone's heard by now, Vertigo, then it goes somewhat slower through Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, Yahweh, All Because Of You, and other great ballads. This album has borrowed the sound from The Joshua Tree and turned this album into its little brother. Oh, and every song here is great and exceptionally listenable, especially Vertigo, which features some of Edge's best guitar work. This is a great buy for any U2 fan out there, and if you're just getting into U2, this album is a good way to start.
B0006399FS|4.0|After a first listen of the \\"Bomb\\", my thinking was \\"this sounds OK, but the melodies are not very new or interesting and it sounds much like what they've done before.\\" But I've found this album to be the proverbial \\"grower\\" I've played it through about 5 times now, and find that the impact of the songs comes not so much through melody as through provocative lyrics and  powerful and fascinating combinations of rhythm, sound and voice. This music is meant for the arena; it's meant to move hearts, and it does. I especially like \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", an allusion to the Biblical parable of the beggar Lazarus who longed to fill his stomach from the crumbs that fell from a rich man's table.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This review is addressed to all the reviewers who complained about book content that was left out of the film.  There are always things left out of a film.  Why?  For example, if a peripheral character doesn't reinforce the main storyline, the writer, who in this case, Steve Kloves (screenwriter of the first two films) excised from the final script.  So story content decisions likely did not fall into director Alfonso Cuaron's duties, thus it is not fair to blame him for that.<br /><br />With most Potter films running over two hours, most theaters can't show the movie more than 4 times a day on a single screen.  That extra show is very important for a theater's first theatrical weeks when the interest is high.  Ultimately, they probably shot most of the stuff that people are complaining about, and they'll end up on a special edition DVD as deleted scenes.  Most people who are not fanatics of Harry Potter don't have an attention span that could follow the film for more than two and a half hours.  That's already pushing the envelope.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", in my opinion, is the best book thusfar.  Sirius Black is the most intriguing character of the series alongside Professor Lupin, and both are in this film.  David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are two of the finest actors in the world.  Emma Thompson isn't a slouch either.  They elevated the level of performances, including that of the principal three: Harry, Ron and Hermione.  Harry's scenes with Lupin were some of the most genuine, character-developing of the entire series.  This film possessed, in a word, depth, that was sorely lacking in the first two films.  The first film established Harry's backstory.  It was pleasant.  I believe I slept through most of the second film.  It was, coincidentally, the most dull book of the series.  Chris Columbus seemingly directed the film on auto-pilot.  For most non-Potter fans over 10 years of age, \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" has the most to offer as a genuine cinematic film.  I recommend it on that basis to the general public.s a genuine cinematic film.  I recommend it on that basis to the general public.
B0000028RR|5.0|Best album of the 90's, bar none. If you have one shred of political angst in you or you simply enjoying rocking out, there's no reason why this wouldn't be in your collection. Every song is a 10, Tom Morello(and his magic tricks) provide continuous ear candy, along with the deep, timely bass of Timmy C. and the heartfelt pounding of Brad Wilk on the skins. Oh, did I mention the intense, soul-digging vocals of Mr. Zack? The guy is amazing. I could go on, but you get the idea!
B000089RV6|5.0|After the death of Bon Scott, AC/DC found Brian Johnson and released their chart topper \\"Back in Black\\" And they WERE back, and they still are. <br />     Many classics from AC/DC are on this CD. With such songs as \\"Hells Bells\\" \\"Shoot to thrill\\" \\"Back in Black\\" \\"You shook me All Night Long\\" and \\"Rock 'n roll ain't noise Pollution,\\" You just CAN't go wrong! <br />     Ignore the 3 idiots that give this album 2 stars, this is obviously NOT a cheesy CD, and could possibly be one of the GREATEST Rock 'n Roll CDs ever released. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006FDHI|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre 6 times when it came out in 1984 (when I was about 13).  Now, in late 2004 I saw it again for the first time in exactly 20 years.  And I'm still overwhelmed.  Little did I know Hollywood can produce something this classy. <br /> <br />The sound and picture are quite satisfactory in quality.  The extra 20 minutes don't really add much to the story, though the film now requires (I think) an R-rating as a result.   <br /> <br />I don't know if Salieri killed Mozart.  I doubt it though.  Still, from my reading, there is ample evidence to suggest that Salieri really was Mozart's secret enemy, and that he created as many employment hurdles for Mozart in the Viennese court as he could.  If true, then this means the real Salieri did play a role in Mozart's poverty after all.  So why am I not surprised no one cries out loud about character-assassination.  The fellow was a creep whether or not he killed Mozart.  And a lousy composer besides.  No tears for Salieri from me, but many for Mozart. <br /> <br />The irony is not lost on me.  Tom Hulce, who played the title-role with such consummate skills (plus real piano finesse) won no Oscar for being a Supporting Actor.  Murray Abraham, on the other hand, won the Best Actor.  Now, I agree Abraham was superb in this film (though some of it was helped by the fanatastic makeup).  But to me Hulce lost out big time.  I mean, they gave this film Oscars for Sound, Art Direction, Adapted Screenplay and what not - but for Hulce, nothing at all.  Sounds familiar, anyone?  A Mozart tragedy was repeated in real life, by - of all things - the film about Mozart.
0800177177|5.0|Coppola did an amazing job on this film, drama fans will love it, horror fans will like it and advanture fans will love it, a truly visually amazing film.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Cuaron was following in Chris Columbus' footsteps by choosing to do the 3rd movie.  I loved the movie a bunch and can't wait to watch it again.  I would have to say my favorite part of the movie was when Hermione punched Malfoy.  That was, as Ron would say, brilliant.   <br /> <br />I think there could have been a few things changed that would have made the people who saw it in theatres to go buy it imediately when it came out.  If Cuaron had followed the book a little better all the really big Harry Potter fans, like me, would not have been upset that Harry got the firebolt at the end of the year instead of at Christmas.  I also think that if Cuaron had shown a little more quidditch people would have been happier.  The problem with adding in more quidditch, is that it makes the movie longer.  The problem with making a movie longer is that it costs more money.  That is what they are struggling with right now with the filming of Goblet of Fire.   <br /> <br />Goblet of Fire is a 700 page book.  Prisoner of Azkaban was only like 300 pages, yet the movies are goign to be right about the same length.  The new director, Mike Newell, is taking out tons of stuff that was in the Goblet of Fire book.  The movie that probably should be at least 3 hours is only going to be 2 hours and 30 min.  They just don't have the time to put some of the other stuff in.  That is the problem I think they had with Prisoner of Azkaban.  They just ran out of time filming so they went out of order.  You can never be too certain though.  I just wish that the directors of the future Harry Potter movies can find a way to include 90% of the important stuff from the books.
B00005Y228|4.0|Kylie's FEVER has remained as one of my favorite dance albums. The songs are infectuous and have me singing along and dancing. From the first single \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" (which you couldn't if you tried) to the bubbly and energetic title track, there's dance written all over this fine album. My only complaint is near the end there are some songs that aren't as strong, like \\"Dancefloor\\", \\"Your Love\\" and \\"Love Affair\\", but the rest of the tracks are fab! The ballad \\"Fragile\\" is one of her best. \\"Love At First Sight\\" is another classic that has a catchy chorus that stays in your head. Other highlights include \\"Burning Up\\", \\"Give It To Me\\" and \\"In Your Eyes\\". A great album from Kylie!
B0002YLC24|4.0|The movie is about two people who meet again after nine years and talk to catch up with each other. But if you've seen Before Sunrise you know that it isn't that simple. And even if you didn't you still get a sense of history between these two individuals caught in some attachment to the past. They talk about their relationships and career choices. They express ideas that they hold to about love, the environment, and religious experience.  It's like a deep conversation you would have with someone who was your best friend long ago. It's really an enchanting movie. And you find yourself caring about these people and what they think and do (something that is sadly lacking from a lot of other movies). In my honest opinion \\"Before Sunrise\\"(maybe because it carried the energetic youthful spirit of the characters) was better but this movie is still wonderful and definitely more mature. I must add that Julie Delpy was totally realistic and engaging in this. I found myself like Ethan Hawke's character, who just observes how incredible this woman is. Celine is one of the better written female characters of movie history(IMO). I'm hoping that Julie Delpy gets a Best Actress nomination because she gave a very beautiful performance (especially the last scene. I'll never think of Nina Simone the same way again).
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost In Translation, the second feature film from Sofia Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), is an amazing motion picture about life's little chance happenings. <br /> <br />Bob Harris (played to the finest degree by Bill Murray) is a tired, washed-up B-movie actor who is stuck in Japan doing whisky commercials when he could be out reviving his career or taking care of his distant family. He can't sleep, he's jetlagged, and worst of all, he doesn't speak the language. He just wants to get out of Japan as quickly as possible. <br /> <br />Charlotte (the fantastic Scarlett Johannsen) is in Japan because her \\"get-up-and-go\\" photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is on assignment, shooting local bands and the like. He is mostly gone for the whole duration of the movie (I would have like to have seen more of him), so Charlotte has to figure out someway to entertain herself. She just came out of college (with a degree in Philosophy, no less), and she's stuck at the stage in her life where you wonder what to make of it all. She stays at the same hotel that Bob does. <br /> <br />One night at the hotel bar, they meet, and immediatly click. Not a romance type of bonding, more like a really good friend type. They immediatly see much of what they have in common. <br /> <br />Most of the movie just shows what these two characters do to whittle away the days. Over time, their bond grows stronger, and by the end, you'll wish the movie was longer. <br /> <br />Bill Murray is at his best here in this movie. Even better than his surprising turn in Rushmore! You will never look at Bill the same way again. His Oscar nomination was well deserved. <br /> <br />Ms. Johanssen is an actress to look out for. She has stunning good looks, and she perfectly fits into the character she plays.  <br /> <br />The cinematography is very dream-like, and although I enjoy that type of style, I understand some people don't much care for it. Most of the people I've talked to about this movie say it is boring,stupid, and nothing really happens.  <br /> <br />First off, it is not boring. You deeply care about the characters by the time the film ends, and you want to know what happens to them. <br /> <br />Stupid...pfft! No, in fact this is a movie that does not insult your intelligence. It's a very thought provoking piece of cinema. <br /> <br />And on the subject of nothing happening, what, do you expect them to have sex? I mean come on, I am personally glad they didn't do it. It would've been a cheap cop-out to their whole relationship. Their relationship is not exactly romantic, it's more like father-daughter in a way. <br /> <br />Sofia Coppola should be commended for making this film, and she was totally deserving of the Oscar for Best Screenplay (which she won). <br /> <br />Lost In Translation...is great. <br /> <br />If you like this film, why not watch Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind?
B00004Z400|1.0|A pathetic attempt to create a unique album. Chynoe thinks that all of us will buy his music because he acts punk, but if he were really punk he'd have to buy cool clothes, like Tom from Blink182. And we all know that if we want to listen to hardcore underground punk/ska, we have our Good Charlotte. So do yourself a favor, and don't buy this album, unless you enjoy supporting punk posers like Chynoe. From the reggae \\"Bak 2 Skool\\" to the emo/punk \\"Pink Mage-it\\", this album is a sure letdown. If you want a good listen, go buy Aaron Carter's debut.
B0006399FS|1.0|What a dissapointment!!!!!!!! <br />I can't believe U2 have sunk so low. <br /> <br />\\"How to dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" has no real soul or character to its music and no memorable songs. <br /> <br />U2 kept saying: \\"Oh this is the best record we have done\\", well I'd say its by far they're worst. <br /> <br />The last good U2 album that actually rocked was \\"POP\\", the name of the album of course being exactly the opposite of what music is on that record. <br /> <br />That album is appallingly underated and critizised even though musically it is absolutley brilliant, probably the best U2 album to listen to as a whole. <br /> <br />All that you can't leave behind which followed had some alright songs but none that were real rock, and that was a commercial album for the masses as well. <br /> <br />U2 also claimed that \\"How to dismantle an atomic bomb\\" <br />(stupid album name by the way)  <br />would be the old rock n roll U2 updated and would be real rock record, but I don't think it is and I also don't think a great rock song should start off with Bono shouting  <br />\\"Onos Dos Tres...\\"and then \\"turn it up captain.\\"......what the #$%^?! is that all about?\\" <br /> <br />Overall its an apallingly awful album with  a huge commercial hype, which not by a long shot does it justice. <br /> <br />Time they gave it away I think.  <br /> <br />By the way - What a stupid album cover. <br />
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin are great in this cd. They are one of my fav. top 5 groups. Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones have insane guitar skills, Jimmy Page with awesome solos on his two neck guitar throuhgout the whole cd on almost every song. John Bonham's drumming is incredible to listen too. He plays extremely well in this cd, especially on the song Moby Dick which is a 4:00 drum solo. Robert Plant's vocals are also great. I don't know why people don't like his vocals, I think he sings well. ALL combined to make 9 great songs you'll never forget.  <br /> <br />1. Whole Lotta Love- (5:34)-10/10  <br />2. What is and What Should Never Be- (4:44)-10/10  <br />3. The Lemon Song- (6:19)-10/10  <br />4. Thank You- (4:49)- 8/10  <br />5. Heartbraker- (4:14)-10/10  <br />6. Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)- (2:39)-8/10  <br />7. Ramble On- (4:23)-10/10  <br />8. Moby Dick (John Bonham Solo)- (4:21)-10/10  <br />9. Bring it on Home- (4:20)-7/10 <br /> <br />OVERALL-You'll be satisifed with this cd as well as any other Led Zeppelin cd. BUY IT NOW
B00005JMUL|5.0|I've never read the book but was intrigued enough by the promos to take my 5 yr old nephew, who just happens to love Santa and trains. His mother (my sister) and grandfather (my father) came along for the ride. Our venue was a stadium seating theatre with surround sound.<br /><br />The story is unusual in that it is full of symbolism, often times feels like a dream with the wild (acrobat dancers) mixed with the thrilling (train ride) and a touch of the scary (marrionnette car), sadly sweet (little girl and poor boy duet), and mysterious (Hobo).<br /><br />The sound and visual effects are amazing. In a crowded theatre, you could still hear the soft hiss of the radiator while the boy tries to sleep on Christmas Eve. And the sound of the train coming reminds one of the infamous Jurassic Park scene causing ripples on water. The visuals are just mindboggling.<br /><br />Now some caveats: the sound and sights can be very intense for first time young viewers. My nephew did get scared in a few parts, especially during the Marrionnette car and some of the train racing. Yet he couldn't make himself leave the theatre chosing to hide in the entrance aisle and come back for more. Many kids in the audience cheered, with some even singing along to the story.<br /><br />After buying the soundtrack cd (another great addition till the DVD comes out), I only have more appreciation for the film.<br /><br />Polar Express is an adventure for all those kids who aren't quite sure about Santa anymore.<br /><br />And those Grinch's who don't believe just don't get the meaning of the story. Ignore them and take your family, or go treat the child within you this season. It will bring back your love of toy trains, waiting up for Santa, and wishing dreams could really be trusted to come true.
B00003CWL6|5.0|First things first. Yes, this movie is as good as you've heard. It does deserve every award it has received. It does not, however, leave you uplifted and happy.... or does it? Yes, it has a somewhat ambivalent message, and I think revels in the fact that it is somewhat ambivalent. Kevin Spacey's character dies, but dies happy and actually smiling. He gets his wish, in terms of one of his daughter's friend, and then realizes that he can't take the opportunity.  <br />And so on and so on..... <br /> <br />If you haven't seen it, see it. If you saw it a long time ago, see it again.
B00003CXUM|4.0|It is often a shock when we see the art of another culture.  In The Mood for Love is great art.  Film romance in America recalls films like Casablanca or Gone With The Wind.  Bogart and Bergman cannot consummate their great love.  Brett and Scarlet can consummate, but the love part is tricky for Scarlet.  What I think I'm trying to say, everyone with a modest love life has fallen for that special someone that got away.  For the American audience, the resulting hurt is gripping in story or film.  We mourn lost love.  Well, the Chinese director Wong Kat-wai's gives us a Buddhist version of lost love.  It resembles mourning.   <br /> <br />The lovers have cheating spouses in common and a common hallway to their apartments.  Their relationship is maddening.  It is a platonic relationship despite the fact that they are very warm, attractive people. Indeed, Maggie Cheung is sultry hot in silk slit dresses with long legs and 1962 stiletto heels.  They vow not to be like their cheating spouses, but before long they are in desperate need of each other, but their previous declarations takes precedence. <br /> <br />The story is painted.  Think Toulouse-Lautrec meets Gauguin in Hong Kong.  The colors are dazzling and the scene set-ups are all about the artist's eye.  What was that Charles De Gaulle scene in Cambodia at the end of the movie?  What's with the Buddhist Temple as a Notre Dame Cathedral in Cambodia?  I can't be sure.  Perhaps it's Buddhist sophisms.  This film is not for fans of American romance, so be forewarned, but it is an exotic and fine piece of art. <br />
B0006399FS|3.0|Initial reviews are wildly overrating this above-average offering, which harks back to U2's early guitar sound but amps up the intelligence quotient of the lyrics. This is so accessible, however, that its long-term wear prospects may be questionable. \\"Vertigo\\" is a fun first single, but it may be too catchy to last very long before listeners get sick of it. It doesn't hold up as well as its counterpart, \\"It's A Beautiful Day,\\" from U2's previous CD. Some say this CD sounds like \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" but I'm not hearing the comparison. This is more energetic and, therefore, may possibly not have very long legs. The guitar playing of the Edge is very good here, to be sure. And Bono actually sounds younger than he did four years ago. \\"Bomb\\" does flow pretty seamlessly, and it makes for a pleasant listen, just maybe not one you'll still be listening to a year from now.

0385513755|1.0|I bought this book only after hearing all the praise for it.  It will be a long time before I make that mistake again.  Unlike many reviewers I'm not a stranger to cryptography, Paris, the Louvre, or the history of the Templars.  I found this book to be really irritating, a child could detect the flaws in the plot.  I was actually angered by the ending.  I seriously doubt that I will ever again read a book by this author.
B0002VYQ2U|4.0|I bought the original CD Audio of Ms. Jones' first alblum, only to see it later released on SACD (Super Audio CD), which I then bought.  The SACD is much much better sounding than the CD, so I have been waiting for an SACD or DVD-Audio version of Feels Like Home as well.  SACD and DVD-Audio are as big an advance in sound quality over regular CD's as LP's were over 78's.  SACD and DVD-Audio combine the best of CD's with the best features of all analog playback, whether vinyl or reel to reel.  To get back to the point, all music, but particularly music as good as Ms. Jones' music, deserves SACD or DVD-Audio treatment.  CD only release shortchanges the music, like releasing music only as MP-3's would.
B00005JNEI|3.0|After watching the movie it is quite amazing to see how one, even myself, can be sucked into the story and start to believe the viewpoints portrayed.  After knowing that propagandists in Germany (during WWII) and other countries would not allow the masses to see ANY other views, I decided to take the leap and look into other films like Farenhype 911 (show actual entire footage not the false editing of Mr. Moore) and other information.  It is amazing to see how sooo many people fail to make even the slightest effort to look into other views even if they KNOW there are serious problems with the facts of the movie.  It is AMAZING to see how people make decisions based on half truths as long as they are PORTRAYED as if they are facts.  For all of those that looked into other sources, (as any resonable person should do before making an educated decision) my hats off to you, for those who have not done so, I respect your opinion, but unfortunately most of your view is based on half-facts and being manipulated by a skilled movie director.
B0006213H6|4.0|O.k., if you're a Sigur Ros fan, you should know, and I don't know how you couldn't, that this was an earlier release.  If you were expecting this to be their latest release, you're either very forgetful, or just not a true fan of the band.  I might be able to understand, if they had disguised the title, but they didn't do that at all.  Saying that, I think it's great that they have released it in the states.  Now we don't have to spend a hand full of money for an import.  And saying that, I can't wait for their next release, I'm sure it will please everyone.  It's just too bad that this one didn't.
B000000OQF|5.0|I loved AFD, but didn't like Use Your Illusion I or II. Anyway, I've always wanted to do one of these song-by-song analysises. <br /> <br />Welcome to the Jungle: Great opening song, awesome guitarwork by Slash and vocals by Axl. Superb fast-paced metal song. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />It's So Easy: Not a terrible song, but far from a great. The end with \\"It's so easy\\" being repeated over and over gets boring fast. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />Nightrain: Good sort of old-fashioned rock song. Fast and doesn't get boring. Catchey tunes. 4/5 <br /> <br />Out To Get Me: Sort of like \\"It's So Easy\\", gets boring and I usually skip it about half way through. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />Mr. Brownstone: Awesome song. Not your typical power guitar 80's metal song, but still one of the best songs on the album. At first it seems like it'd be easy to figure out the lyrics, but I still can't figure it out. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Paradise City: Wow. Wow. The first GNR song I ever heard and influenced my decision to get AFD. Tough it might be a tad bit long, it never gets old and a must-listen for any rock fan. 5/5 <br /> <br />My Michelle: They could have made this song into a sort of dark, heavy metal song, but instead it takes a turn for the lighter into a love song. I would rather them take the turn into a heavy dark song. But I love that set of super-heavy chords thats played repeatedly. 4/5 <br /> <br />Think About You: Follows up a love song like My Michelle with another love song Think About You. It's nothing special, but nothing to skip either. 3/5 <br /> <br />Sweet Child O' Mine: Great song. Sorta quieter than most GNR songs, but great opening chords and keeps you around for the whole song. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Alright, I'm getting bored now, I'm gonna go listen to this album again and then maybe write a review for Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or something.
0440237688|5.0|This book really made you think. It engrosses you and makes you care deeply about the outcome. You can read it over and over again getting something new out of each time. Highly reccomanded for every age!
B0006399FS|4.0|This album is definitely one of the best albums U2 has produced.  Sure it's not as timeless as Joshua Tree or groundbreaking as Achtung Baby! but it is a solid album and the perfect follow up to All That You Can't Leave Behind.  As an owner of every single album of U2, and having listened to How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb well over ten times, this album improves upon the last album (if that could even be possible).  Bono's voice has never sounded better, Edge continues to write excellent riffs, and Adam and Larry continue to be the heart of the band, infusing the steady rhythm U2 needs to keep on ticking.  \\"Vertigo\\" is one of the most energetic songs U2 has made and a great first single.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" can bring anyone with a heart close to tears.  \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", and \\"All because of You\\" leave you with a smile on your face.  Finally, this album ends with the best closer since \\"40\\" in \\"Yahweh\\".  All in all, U2 has made an album encompassing all the emotions of humanity, one that you can listen to at anytime during your life. <br /> <br />Buy this album and do not make any judgements until you've heard it through at least 3-4 times.  Like all great albums, it takes some listenings and like all great albums, it will become a part of you and the music will sound like it's always been there. <br /> <br />**I would actually rate this album at 4.5 stars but that option is not available.
B00005221M|5.0|Like many people here, I detest the recut DVD version of this film. Seeing the original theatrical version in 1992 was one of the key moviegoing experiences of my life. I don't buy DVDs to see a new spin on a movie I liked, I buy them to be able to rewatch that same movie. Alternate cuts are fine as a bonus feature, but once I saw how Michael Mann had butchered his mainstream masterpiece, giving no option of seeing how it was originally, I sold the DVD and bought a copy of the mercifully untouched widescreen VHS.    Recently, however, I discovered that while this American director's cut DVD is from Fox, Warner Bros holds the rights to Mohicans outside the USA, and they have released the original theatrical version on DVD around the globe. I have a regionless DVD player, which is easy to get in many stores for under fifty dollars, so I bought a copy of the British DVD at amazon.co.uk    Wow. It's as I remembered it, with the Clannad song, without the extra monologue over the closing scene, and with my favorite line back in -- \\"My father warned me about people like you. He said do not try to understand them, and do not try to make them understand you.\\"    If you love this movie like I do, get a regionless DVD player, they're worth it for so many reasons, and then get a copy of the British DVD. You'll be glad you did.    Update - 2014 - I've just purchased the Taiwanese Warner Bros DVD, and I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It's NTSC, so it's at normal speed. The UK disc is great, but it's PAL, which involves a 4% speed-up. If you need more info on PAL speed-up, it's easy to find on Google. The Taiwanese disc is still Region 3, so you'll still need a regionless player. However it's definitely superior to the UK disc.    Please note that I'm talking about the DVD only. All Blu-Rays of this film, everywhere in the world, contain the third 2010 cut of the film, which is a hybrid of the 1992 theatrical cut and the 1999 DVD cut. It undoes most of the changes people objected to most in the 1999 cut (the monologue at the end is gone and the Clannad song is back, though purists should note that the new cut now uses a different verse of the song, not in English), but it's still not exactly the same as the 1992 cut. These Warner Bros DVDs are still the only way to get that original cut
B000062YAZ|1.0|Slayer is the worst band in existance, they are talentless and they suck at drumming.  they are over rated and they werent as influential as the great jon davis or kirk cobain!!!    naplam death is pop punk  limp bizkit is thrash metal  and iron maiden ripped off papa roach    Remember for talent, stick with eminem, ja rule, 50 cent, mariah carey, spice girls, hanson, blink 182, good charlotte, and         unfortunately this is my last review. I would love to continue, but for personal reasons I must quit.  many of you remember me as bernard thomas, henry mcpruter, sunburnt albino... etc well My days are over.  nothing in life lasts forever. happy thanksgiving. and good luck
B000002AOD|5.0|I write only to mention, since no one else has, that this CD features Giovanni Hidalgo on congas. There is every other conga player in the world, and then there's Giovanni. Yes, he's that good.
B0000025KI|5.0|This is one strong album, probably the best and most versatile record Springsteen has ever delivered. A strong case can be made for \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\" as well, and \\"Born In The USA\\", of course, but this is my favorite of the lot.  Some people like to hate it because it's too commercial and some of the lyrics aren't all that \\"deep\\". I suspect they would have been right up there with the hecklers, shouting \\"Judas\\" at Bob Dylan in the mid-60s when he went electric.    Me, I love this album. Great for a long ride in the car...just be careful when you change discs!   It spans the entire emotional spectrum, from the joyously defiant \\"Sherry Darling\\" to the hopelessness of the title track.  And while songs like the lightweight \\"Crush On You\\" and the monotonous \\"I'm A Rocker\\" aren't among Springsteen's most interesting, \\"The River\\" actually boasts some of his finest lyrics and some of his best melodies as well. The driving \\"Sherry Darling\\" and the top-5 single \\"Hungry Heart\\" are two of the greatest rockers he has ever recorded, and Bruce Springsteen cut one of his best and most mature songs at the age of thirty with \\"Independence Day\\".  The thundering \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" is also here, as are \\"Two Hearts\\", \\"Out In The Street\\", the ballad \\"Fade Away\\", and the angry \\"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\\", and almost all of the lesser-known songs are excellent as well. \\"Jackson Cage\\" is a stomping, melodic rocker, \\"The Price You Pay\\", \\"Point Blank\\" and \\"Wreck On The Highway\\" are three very somber slow numbers, and if \\"I Wanna Marry You\\" is slightly too cute, it is also exquisitely melodic and impossible to resist.    There are more up-tempo numbers here than on \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\", and more hooks as well, perhaps, but \\"The River\\" is not yet as straight-ahead pop-radio friendly as \\"Born In The USA\\"; it is grittier and spans more moods. To me, it is Bruce Springsteen's finest hour, one of the finest rock records of the 80s.
B000022TSH|5.0|This film noir about a woman with a terrible secret is great.  I have seen it so many times I've lost count.  Good thing I bought it on DVD.  It was the first video I ever bought, a long, long time ago!  The DVD contains a really great interview with Roman Polanski and Robert Evans.  I highly recommend it.
B00005LK95|5.0|If you love campy 80s fun, you can't go wrong with the two Short Circuit movies. And in my opinion, this sequel is even better than the first! Some people complain that Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg are not in this sequel, but they're missing the point-- the true star of both movies is the robot Johnny 5. Sure, losing Sheedy and Guttenberg takes away from some of its camp value, but in their place you get a SNL alum in Michael McKean, who also starred in some other 80s camp classics (like Clue).  <br /> <br />For this sequel, the film's creators sidestepped the \\"more of the same\\" pitfall that most sequels fall into. This time, Johnny 5 is in the big city, living with his former nemesis, Ben Jahrvi, who has since taken to small-time toy electronics after losing his job in the first film. Initially he is there to help Ben build his toy robots, but a more sinister plot emerges concerning some jewel thieves who want to take advantage of Johnny's naivety.  <br /> <br />All the best parts of the original are here, but are even more fun. Johnny explores the city and learns how humans behave, and along the way he must learn that people do not easily accept what he is (a living robot). There is actually a metaphor here for acceptance, and what it's like to live as a second-class citizen in a society that rejects you. Because of this, it's a deeper and more emotional film than the first, but it never forgets that it's a campy 80s movie that is just fun to watch. <br /> <br />Hats off to the writers who decided to go the unpredictable route with this sequel, and managed to make it fresh and entertaining. I loved this movie as a child, and now I can say it still holds up to the test of time.
B00005JN7O|1.0|I didn't rush to see this movie, and was glad I didn't stand in the queue for its preview!  <br /> <br />This movie is a huge waste of time. The main problem was the plot, I cannot believe the movie ended like that, which was brainless. I remember watching a James Bond movie with a similar plot - crazy scientist who wants to built an ark, fly it into space and incinerate the earth destroying civilization - remember Moonraker anyone? <br /> <br />The acting was disastrously hideous! Gwyneth Paltrow (the Bond Girl equivalent) was her irritating perky self, she seems to act that way in all her movies, how she won an Academy Award is beyond me - really! Jude Law (James Bond equivalent) was just the pretty boy and Giovanni Ribisi was added for comic relief and brains (Q equivalent). Angelina Jolie was added for her eye patch and her...err...lips? <br /> <br />The action was nothing fantastic, imagine Ornithopter equivalent hi-tech planes cannot defeat a WW2 type plane, I find that really hard to believe! <br /> <br />The 1 star I'm giving the movie was because some minute parts of it did look like an old 1960s movie, or a comic strip, but otherwise, nothing else was worth it. <br /> <br />I highly recommend NOT to even bother watching this movie at all, save your money for something better.
B0002XDODU|5.0|This cd is great.  That is all i can say.  All the songs are good.  It is just as good as \\"Mutter\\", and maybe even better.  I suggest that all fans of Rammstein go out and purchase this cd as soon as possible.
B00005JMJG|5.0|i take back everything i ever said about jim carrey being a mugger and an overacting wacko too jacked up on his own petard to see what a muggging overacting wacko he is on screen-- yes i take it all back-maybe the great script the great director here -he took acting lessons he found his inner adult !? i dont know-- but this movie-- literally for me defines a new level of acting not just for jim carrey and everyone else in this wonderful touching charming intelligent funny ever so human  & beautifully realized gem of a movie -- but a new level of screen acting altogether! our favorite new but now old jerry lewis on acid seems to be channeling pure stanislavski !!! the new jim carrey in this movie-- does things that are so real so sensitive so in the moment-- it was a revelation for me to see -- esp from him !!! and the most amazing moment ? when jim is walking down the street and there is a van following him-- close by -- and the loook on his face-- the slight paranoia even humiliation-- anyway it was so quick so sudden-- this fleeting real look on his face-- i do not know how he did it-- how it was captured-- how many takes it took-  but it- that moment and that fleeting look-- so real -- so incredibly real--should be memorialized as the new greatest moment in 20th century film acting----move over marlon -- make room on the couch ! i wax poetic and tend toward hyperbole-- but ahhhhhhhh my friends check out this movie and that scene !  a new defining moment in film acting !!! all you posers out there ! take a look at what being in the moment can yield ! (if yer this new jim carrey i guess ! )  good job jimbo & congrats to u and everyone involved in the best movie ive seen all year-- in years in fact !
B00005JNEI|5.0|The scariest thing of all, that all u.s. citizens that are banning this as propaganda are missing is that all over the world there have been numerous documentaries that practically prove Moore's points, what the so-called 'all-american-patriots' discard as propaganda. If you happened to live outside the states you'd know even MORE. And there are many documentaries that take it even further. <br /> <br />Oh, but i know... it's all a conspiracy, isn't it? The whole Mean World against the poor U.S.! It must be a great burden to have to carry that cross, huh? Of course... <br /> <br />Get a satelite dish, and face the fact that what Moore is saying is only pointing to the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br />I agree that what Moore should do next is focus on international opinion. That should put things in the right context (of course not for those who believe that they already live in the land of the free, unbiased information).  <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is shock therapy for those who are still living in a dream soon to be a nightmare. Wake up. <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|I must say I am a bit baffled by some of these negative reviews.  To those of you angry over this release, what exactly were you expecting?  A Fugazi album?  U2 is (and has always been) a pop band, and this is a beautiful pop album.  If you disagree, fine, but say so and why instead of going into mindless rants about Bono's ego. <br /> <br />I think \\"Atomic Bomb\\" exhibits some of U2's best songwriting, both lyrically and sonically (and yes, I like \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop\\" as much as I do \\"The Joshua Tree\\").  I do think tracks 6 & 7 ('All Because of You' and 'A Man and a Woman,' respectively) are more filler-quality, but overall I'd say this is U2's fourth masterpiece. <br /> <br />It's a driving pop album that has a bit of U2's 80's-era energy coupled with sheer epic beauty.  In my opinion, 'Sometimes You Can't Make It...' is one of their strongest efforts to date; 'Miracle Drug' could be on an updated \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Unforgettable Fire.\\"  'Crumbs from Your Table' is, to me, a very poignant social commentary.  'One Step Closer' and 'Original of the Species' are tremendously well-written, despite what some of the more venomous reviews claim. <br /> <br />Unless you are too cool to admit to liking pop music, this album should be in your collection... one of the best of 2004.
0634060384|5.0|The Real Book should set the minimum standard for all fake books.  <br /> <br /> As a beginner, I was timid about purchasing this book. What a delight to see large clear type, a song for each page or two page songs that face one another.  I even discovered that I could play some songs immediately which was not possible with the same songs in a book such as \\"This is the Ultimate Fake Book with Over 1200 Songs.\\"  In that book the print was so small that I had to squint constantly to try to read the notes. I bought new glasses.  Even then,  I swore that I would never buy another book published by Hal Leonard.  Well, guess what.  This is a book also published by Hal Leonard.  And it's wonderful.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|I love Will Ferrell, so I had to see this movie, even though I had my doubts.  I had suspected that this was going to be very corny and child-like, but was proven wrong.  The plot to this movie is actually quite good and the cast does a great job of making this movie very entertaining.   <br />The plot has Will Ferrell as a baby in an orphanage, who accidentally winds up in Santa's bag one Christmas night.  He is then discovered at the North Pole and is apparently too cute for Santa to return.  So, Bob Newhart(great to see him in ANY film) takes Will Ferrell and raises him as his own in the North Pole, until the day comes that Ferrell realizes he is not an elf and that he is actually a human.  Naturally, he wants to visit his parents and hence our story goes on. <br />I thought that the elf-life brought to New York city was absolutly histerical.  And, it is so nice to see Ferrell doing a movie that can be enjoyed by folks of all ages.  This movie definetly was made for children, but has smart, mature humor as well.   <br />Zooey Daschul(prbably spelled wrong) is excellent as the girl that ferrell falls in love with and James Caan is wonderful as Ferrell's lost father, who is WAY out of the Christmas spirit. <br />I recommend this movie to all families, movie-lovers and any in-between.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Avril Lavigne is back with her brand new album...and it sounds the same as her first.  The only difference between this album and her first is that there is slightly more guitar work in her songs, some songs appear to be talkng about something a little deeper than boyfriends, and Avril makes an attempt to sing different notes.  No points for key change, though.<br />Other than that, its the same old, same old.  We can only hope that she'll get better with age.
B000066NW0|3.0|The first couple of times you listen to this CD, it's not bad.  After a while the novelty wears off and you realise that there are only 2 songs that could be considered as rock, and they rest are pop rubish.  <br />The instrumentation in the songs is poor.  The guitar chords are very repetive throughout the whole album, and Lavigne sings the same notes in the same key for every song. Not to metion all of her songs seem to be based off the same experience. She doesn't appear to have any sort of range at all, and if she does she doesn't use it.<br />So why three stars?  Despite all my slurs, the first couple of songs on the album are good.  Overall?  Spend your money on something else.
0451191153|5.0|While I would not go as far as saying this is a \\"must-read\\" book, I would recommend it. Ayn Rand is a great writer. Yeah, a lot of this book is heavily flawed, but it still a worthwhile read, if for no other reason than its fame.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I doubt if any of us can imagine the hardships during this time at sea. The movie shows the grit and force of will men had to posess to travel half way around the world and still fight a war with nothing but the belief in yourself and the men around you. The movie is evenly balanced and shows the way of war and the human cost involved. Well done!
B00005JNJ7|4.0|Except perhaps for The Passion of the Christ, I can't think of a film I've seen that is more deserving of its \\"R\\" rating than Team America: World Police. There is plenty in this movie to offend everyone and I strongly encourage those who are offended by, well, everything you can imagine that's offensive (and some creatively offensive stuff you haven't imagined yet), to skip it. However, for those who process the world as I do -- a little off-key and out-of-focus, then the absurdity of the film results in one of the most ironic celebrations of uniquely American freedom of expression I've ever witnessed. (I'll get back that in a minute.)<br /><br />Again, before you interpret what I'm saying as encouragement to see the film, let me repeat once more that it is filled with sophomoric goof-ball stupidity (probably only enjoyed by fans of Three Stooges and South Park) and content guaranteed to offend you and anyone else who is straight or gay or of any ethnic background or gender. It wallows in vulgarity, crudeness and violence and sex (involving puppets). You will likely hate it and wonder why I had anything positive to say about it. But I do, and not because it is said to be \\"anti-Michael-Moore.\\" Indeed, it's been said that right-wingers will love the movie because it mocks Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin and the whole pretentious Hollywood leftist cartel. And while the movie does those things (to put it mildly), there is no way the right-wingers I know will love a film skewering American foreign policy as one characterized by a doctrine of blow-up first, ask questions later (nor, for that matter, will they be receptive to a running joke about multiples of 911). This is not a film that will please the anti-Michael-Moore crowd despite the graphicallly pleasant way the marionette version of Moore, a suicide bomber, is blown to smithereens (and this is one of the less-puppet-violent scenes in the film).<br /><br />At its core, the movie is less a political polemic than it is a chomping satire of Hollywood action films -- of boilerplate plot lines, cinematic devices, big-time genre directors, musical scores and, in hilarious fashion -- the use of montages to communicate in a couple of minutes how the central character is transformed from inexperienced into expert. There are so many baseball-bat-to-the-head slams at Hollywood cliches, it is impossible to keep up with them. A wonderful example of the depth of the filmakers' Shermanesque approach to torching Hollywood is a song that compares how much the singer loves someone to how bad the film Pearl Harbor was. And, if you sit through the entire ending credits, you'll be treated to a short ditty called, \\"You're Useless, Alec Baldwin.\\" Members of the Film Actors Guild (FAGs) are portrayed as unwitting puppets (metaphorically and literally) of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il who is one of the funniest characters in the movie.<br /><br />Again, while I encourage you to skip seeing it if you're the least put-off by, say, the longest vomit-scene in movie history, this film is a celebration of a brand of artistic freedom that is uniquely American and, frankly, hard to understand by others. I say this because it is a big-studio, big-time production that is clearly intended to be hugely profitable by pandering to those who like to drink crudeness at a firehose, where profit motivations far outweigh the chances that all involved with the movie will likely have a death-sentence issued on them by some fundamentalist cleric somewhere. As this film is viewed around the world, the international audiences will both laugh \\"at\\" the stereotypically American xenophobe, portrayed as trigger-happy cowboys who will blow up the Louvre in order to kill four terrorists.

B0006399FS|5.0|I find it intersesting that the people giving HTDAAB bad reviews are saying that Vertigo is the only good song, whereas people who enjoy the album are saying that its one of the weaker tracks. I think this shows that most people arent giving this album a chance because it isnt full of 3 minute rock songs like the lead single suggested. This album is a grower, you cant judge it fairly with only one listen, which is what i believe many people are doing. Mark my words, in time this album will get more positive reviews and fewer negative reviews as people realise this is a classic U2 album and see that it is much more than 11 Vertigo's.
B00005JMJG|3.0|In the past, I have never been able to sit on my couch and watch a whole movie from beginning to end, until my doctor put me on Microzide to reduce nighttime urination this past month. But I was feeling bouts of dizziness throughout the tailend of this film. I was a bit confused, are they together? Are they separated? I think thats what the film was trying to do, but the plot was quite confusing.  <br />Then I couldn't tell if it was the medication or if there was some problem with the DVD, because they were certain scenes where I couldn't see certain character's faces. They look like they were fuzzy/smudged. I immediately put my Dvd lens cleaner in to correct the problem. I replayed it again. Guess what? Same thing. I'm trying really hard to figure out who the person with the smudged face is. I'm like, Who the heck is that person? Of all luck,I'd had to rent a DVD with digital distortions. I'm thinking that someone at the video store might have stored the DVD near a magnetic device for too long and it slightly distorted some of the digital aspects of the film. Because I'm telling you, if I could tell who that character was, it probably would have made me understand the film a lot more. Did anyone else have this problem? I'm going to rent this film again (but at a different video rental store) and see what happens. I'm only giving the film three stars because of the confusion and I'm giving the video store zero stars for giving me a faulty DVD.
B0006AZMFM|1.0|I really wanted to like this album but unfortunately it is so bland that it makes an artist such as Clay Aiken look as cutting edge as Green Day. I cannot remember a single song from the album and that's after ten spins. Her last album was OK but this is truly awful. I hear that Sony is repackaging the album for the USA so lets hope they include some hits.

Backing vocals are also in here witch is awsome. Love how Sid doz his crap on here.    Disasterpiece 10/10 I didnt care for this song that much when i fist got the album but after listening to this album way over 500 times the song grew on me and the hole thing about \\"No one is..safe\\" i just love the feeling. And when Corey sayd \\"i wanna slit your throat\\" in  the begining i was just like holy sh*t. awsome dark song as well.    My Plague 10/10 there 2nd Single off of \\"Iowa\\" This song is WAY WAY DIFFERENT than the Single off of the Resident Evil Sound track and the Radio Edit. This song is way better than those to. Very awsome song even has some singing in it to.    Everything Ends - 11/10 One of my fav songs off the CD i love how fast it goz and its just an amazing song. Very hard and heavy    The Heretic Anthem - 10/10 the famouse heretic anthem as some of you might know it has the 666 song of as if your 555 then im 666. Really awsome track what more can i say about it...    Gently 10/10 What can i say about this...well it was orignally off of the MFKR album (Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat.) Good song, it is basicly a Poem.    Left Behind - 10/10 There 1st single off the Album. There is really nothing to say about it cuz we all have heard it. Love the music video.    The Shape 9.8/10 Awsome song nice bass    I Am Hated 11/10 Another one of my fav cuz Sid doz some sh*t in this song. You may have heard this song off the movie \\"Rollerball\\" in the rated R version slipknot is playing this song. Great song fast and just amazing    Skin Ticket 9.8/10 2nd longest track off the album, not has fast as most of the songs. Creapy sound to it i must say.    New Abortion 10/10 I just love this song, because you can hear Chris and Shawn saying some sh*t in the part of the song it happens at  2:30 and end at 2:44 you can hear them both do it better on the Disasterpieces DVD.    Metabolic 12/10 One of my favs off the Album pure [...] madness! Song seems to be about his father i am guessing, cuz of some of the lyrics such as \\"Im in so much pain i have ever [...] right to hate you i cant take it! the hardest part was knwing was that i could never be you and now i sit aroudn and wish i could forget you\\" Really awsome song, pretty heavy.    IOWA 11/10 AWSOME song very long 15:05 long,its like another poem basily real dark.      Overall this is my all time fav SlipKnoT Album it is super heavy and Dark sounding    Be sure to check out SlipKnoTs new DVD comming out in 05 from Roadrunner Records...
B000001FDK|5.0|I love this movie, i have wacthed his movie so many time i don't get own this soundtrack but i plan to in the next couple days. You should really get this soundtrack if you love the movie you are sure to love the sound track. i love it and i am only 16.
B000006TSC|2.0|This is Camel's sixth studio album.  I don't think that the LP was ever released in the US. It is 44 minutes long. <br /> <br />Most of the tracks on this on album are not very good.  They are little bouncy ditties, almost like novelty songs.  But, the album does have a gorgeous sound and there are some nice seconds of music.   <br /> <br />This is the second Caravan album to have Richard Sinclair on bass and vocals.  Richard Sinclair was originally from Caravan and went on to form Hatfield and the North and was in other bands.  Many of the songs on this album sound like the worst of Richard Sinclair. <br /> <br />There is one passable track on this album, Sleeper.  It sounds like son of Lunar Sea.  However, it is not quite as good. <br /> <br />In the seventies, Camel was my favorite progressive band (along with PFM).  I continued to buy their albums long after I should have.  When I first heard this album, I was shocked that it was not very good.  I kept playing it over and over again, trying to see if there was something I was missing.  But, Camel was on a downhill slope, only to slightly rebound with I Can See My House From Here.  They did not fully come back to form until the late 1990'a with Rajaz.
B0006399FS|1.0|Hola amigos.  <br />Primero que todo: s que muchos no hablan espaol aqu, pero de todos modos, por slo ver que mi rating es 1 star voy a obtener un mal promedio como helful review, pero no me importa, eso lo nico que hace es confirmar lo que han dicho varios fans, que la gente de U2 est trabajando aqu, poniendo ridculas e infantiles alabanzas a este producto.  <br /> <br />Este album es la decadencia mxima de U2, no es U2, es nada.  <br />No representa sino el estancamiento, la conformidad, el estilo de vida fcil y la exaltacin mxima del ego Rock Star. Mientras mucha gente de U2 aqu desesperadamente trata de salvar este disco, la situacin real es obvia: los fans se sienten engaados y decepcionados con este \\"best U2 album\\".  <br /> <br />Lamentablemente, como ya alguien seal aqu, los fans son tan necios e inmaduros que con sus absurdas y baratas adoraciones a cualquier producto con el sello \\"U2\\" impreso, la banda puede darse el lujo de salir de fiestas con amigos por dos aos, luego juntarse y hacer una nueva versin de ATYCLB, no importando cuan horrible sea Bono como cantante, y vender un producto desechable y nauseabundo.  <br /> <br />No se dan cuenta que con eso lo nico que hacen es daar an ms a la banda, por que les hacen creer que esta mierda es fantstica y genial. Lejos de ello, muchos otros fans se han dado cuenta del robo y la estafa que es este album, includas todas aquellas ediciones de coleccionistas. <br /> <br />Si buscas a un nuevo U2, no lo vas a encontrar en HTDAAB. Si te gusta el U2 osado, vanguardista, innovador y creativo, escucha Achtung Baby, Zooropa Y Pop. Si te gusta el U2 clsico, escucha Joshua Tree y Unforgettable Fire. Si te gusta la decadencia y un U2 para nios, falso, seguro y cmodo, escucha ATYCLB y HTDAAB. <br /> <br />Si van a sacar estas mierdas de albumes, mejor que se retiren, de verdad. Es muy hiriente para fans de U2 como nosotros ( desde antes de Achtung Baby ) ver en lo que se ha convertido la banda, por ello preferimos que se retiren antes de seguir editando estupideces como sta.
B0002KP5FI|4.0|So you might want to take note.  This is a different cd than \\"Jet Sounds\\" from back in 2000, in that it's not the same sort of catchy, up-beat bossa sound.  If you're looking for the sound of \\"Forma 2000\\" or \\"Arabesque\\" or \\"Bossa Per Due\\", you won't find it on this album.  Having said that, if you're a fan of Schema records and have been following several of the musicians they feature, like Gerardo Frisina, Soulstance, Rosalia De Souza and maybe even S-Tone Inc., this cd shouldn't surprise you that much.  I say that because Schema's been noticeably going in a 'rearword' position (ha!) and the sound's evolved - just check Frisina's \\"Hi Note\\" for example.  They've gone more in the mold of some quality, more jazzed up flavored tracks and feels, utilizing real musicians and exploring a fuller, richer musical sound.<br /><br />This is no exception - although being released in conjunction with Blue Note records should've been the ultimate hint!  \\"Sea and Moon\\" starts the cd well and from then on, you get the vibe.  It's relaxed, mature and has a lazy singing.  \\"Wanin' Moon\\" follows up with some key sax and piano solos along with the wonderful voice of Bebe Segue.  Next up is \\"Nefertiti\\", which you could've previewed on \\"Freedom Jazz Dance\\" (the final clue as to Schema's new direction), which features the sultry whispy voice of Cristina Zavalloni (check her feature album!).  Other friends of the label include Gianluca Patrella with the trombone and there are more.  A few more stand-out tracks... I dig the swing in \\"Kind of Sunshine\\" and that beat... nice stuff.  You pop that song in, the bongos start kickin in and you feel the double bass and trumpet solos - this is a song made for stylin' in the city.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a very very good cd.  It really is a different direction from \\"Jet Sounds\\" but I think it's a rather positive testament to Nicola Conte's overall musical knowledge, background and leadership.  Don't worry - if you still want to hear some of that bossa twinge ala Jet Sounds, there are loads and loads of remixes that Nicola Conte's done that you'll dig - like \\"Tic-Tac\\" by Maxwell implosion, \\"Elevator\\" by Jaffa and who can forget Rosalia De Souza's \\"Garota Moderna\\"?  Likewise, remixes that hinted that this was the direction he was going on - Infracom's \\"Quiet Night\\", \\"Meu Samba\\" by Eli Goulart, \\"I Sing This Song Just for You\\" by Xaver Fischer Trio, and several others.  And... if you do dig this cd, then be sure to check out Rosalia De Souza's \\"Garota Diferente\\" and Gerardo Frisina's \\"Hi Note\\" along with Schema's comp \\"Freedom Jazz Dance\\".hear some of that bossa twinge ala Jet Sounds, there are loads and loads of remixes that Nicola Conte's done that you'll dig - like \\"Tic-Tac\\" by Maxwell implosion, \\"Elevator\\" by Jaffa and who can forget Rosalia De Souza's \\"Garota Moderna\\"?

B000002MG1|4.0|'Automatic' is a good album but not totally deserving of the outstanding reviews it has received.  What brings it down is its inconsistency.  Drive is an absolutely amazing song, easily the best on the album.  Unfortunately that means it's downhill from there, although but there is still lots of good stuff.  New Orleans Instrumental, Sweetness Follows, Monty got a Raw Deal, and Find the River are all good tracks that seem like they should be on the same album (along with Drive).  Try Not to Breathe is also good, although it is more reminiscent of earlier REM.  On the other hand, Sidewinder demonstrates Michael Stipe's ability to be really annoying, and Everybody Hurts is the sappiest piece of garbage ever to sully a CD that I own.  The placement of these two tracks near the beginning of the album is unfortunate.  Ignoreland and Man on the Moon are bearable but again, annoying vocals get in the way. <br />I've probably overstated the bad in this review, Automatic is a good album, just not a 5 star.
6300214044|5.0|\\"The Elephant Man\\", with John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins (along with Hannibal Lecter his best piece of acting) is a powerhouse of a film that makes you feel fortunate and unfortunate at the same time--fortunate that you yourself can walk in the street without provoking screams, and unfortunate that you live in a world where a person's physical appearance will cause screams.<br /><br />Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins), a doctor and a devotee of the deformed and the lost, somehow gets wind of a carnival sideshow with a \\"freak\\" who is actually authentic--\\"the elephant man\\", a hideously deformed young person whose physical appearance is so horrendous that no one seems to mind as he is abused by his sketchy master (something strange and homoerotic is ever present in this drunken brute's relentless determination to \\"own\\" Hurt's character), starved, and kept in a sideshow until Treves comes along and emancipates him.<br /><br />At first we believe that Merrick is mentally handicapped, as all he can do to communicate with Treves is grunt and groan in fright.  It turns out, however, (and this is never explained at any length) that Merrick is extremely intelligent and very religious.  Through all the heavily layered and almost suffocating makeup Hurt brings home a characterization that is as unforgettable as it is haunting.  Merrick is a lonely, abused soul fully cognizant of his place in the world.  A side of him seems to believe he is an animal deserving of abuse, while the other side is an astute literary gentleman who wants, in his own somewhat garbled words, only to \\"be good\\".<br /><br />There are scenes in this movie that will make you absolutely furious and scenes that are worthy of tears.  Others will make you happy as you see Merrick go from having a wretched, worthless life to an actually happy and full existence courtesy of Treves.  The relationship between Treves and Merricks is, beyond doubt, one of the most believable and heart-rending bonds between two men ever filmed.<br /><br />The weaknesses are negligible and we can put most of them down to Lynch's unrelenting need to inject the depressing and  strange where they have no place.  The ending, for example, while touching, is inexcusably vague for a film which has commanded that much power up till that point.  Did Merrick commit suicide?  Are we supposed to be seeing him ascend to heaven?  Whatever, this is still one of the greatest films of the century.ever filmed. <br /> <br />The weaknesses are negligible and we can put most of them down to Lynch's unrelenting need to inject the depressing and  strange where they have no place.

B0006J28BO|5.0|Another delightful gift from the Ghibli studios! This film chronicles the adventures of a girl who does a favor for the son of the King of the Cats, and finds herself desparately trying to escape the King's gratitude (which is expressed first with gifts of mice, and later, a betrothal). To do this, she enlists the aid of another magical cat, the dapper and dashing Baron, a hero to melt any girl's heart. <br /> <br />The art and story are adorable without becoming cloying, and the heroine (as all Ghibli heronines inevitably do) learns her important lesson about life and inner strength with dash and derring-do, and without dragging down the story into sermonistic platitudes.  <br /> <br />It does not have the same scope and bravura as the latest Miyazaki tours-de-force \\"Spirited Away\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke,\\" but it is no less delightful and I recommend it no less highly. <br /> <br />[Caveat: This review is based upon a subtitled release. I cannot speak to the quality of the dub--but be brave, reading the subtitles isn't that hard!]
B00002ZMNV|5.0|well my title tells ya...metallica rox. i saw this show on vh1 called 40 least metal moments, 'n this concert was included as one. i was like,\\"wtf?\\" yeh sure symphony is not metal, but come on, i think this concert is awesome, it's a total different feel, kool as hell. the guyz(lars,james,jason,kirk) did a great job pullin it together. the orchestra was great to see, now i'm not a fan of symphonies, but it's jus a total different experience 'n sound for fanz AND metallica. wat's not to like? i jus got this dvd yesterday, 'n i'm tellin ya, this is one of the best dvds i've ever seen. great for collectors 'n die-hard metallica fanz.  <br /> <br />ps.i am kinda upset that they cut their hair short. but i think they look better wit short hair, more clean cut. btw, LARS 'n JASON r awesome! it's sad that jason left tho...
B00063MBU8|1.0|Wow! The rich pretty boys are back on stage. This time they found more things to conplain about. Such as how hard their life is. Wait a second though. They are rich. What do they not have that they want. When was a celebrity ever thrown into the dirt as mentioned in the song \\"Welcome to my Life.\\" Well here we go again. More crapy   teeny bobby music is on its way.
6305232660|1.0|Whenever a movie takes itself seriously, and acts as though it is going to deal seriously with a scientific subject, then I expect them to have the basic science down. This movie was profoundly dissappointing.  I would give them a F minus for the extreme blunders in the science. <br /> <br />The movie begins with a high school boy with unaided eye in Virgina Beach, VA noticing a strange star that is actually the comet and asking his teacher about it.  What?????  Where are the world's professionals?  There are thousands of people world wide who search the skies with good telescopes for comets, hoping to find one so they can get it named after them.  And a boy at sea-level, looking up through the entire atmosphere, in a light polluted area, is the first to see it? <br /> <br />The astronomer freaks out when his computer shows a projected impact with earth, his ISp is down, so he and races in his vehicle down the mountain so fast that he has an accident?  What's the big rush?  It won't hit for over a year and a half.  He can simply telephone, or wait a bit for the ISP to come back up. <br /> <br />The USA gov't keeps it secret for over a year???  No leaks??  No one else in the world ever looks up??? <br /> <br />A manned spacecraft with only a few nukes to destroy the comet?  Cheaper and better chance of success to send several smaller automated ships with lots of nukes. <br /> <br />There is a scene where an astronaut is on the comet's head and is jumping up and down on a stuck probe to free it.  But he should be in microgravity and will only weight as much as a feather. <br /> <br />And the stupidity continued in scene after scene. <br /> <br />Armeggedon was stupid too, but it didn't pretend to take itself seriously.  I viewed it as a kind of comedy so I don't come down so hard on it.
B0006399FS|2.0|What a letdown! The pre-release reviews and the marketing hype had led me to believe that this release harkened back to when U2 was a rock band and played accordingly. Unfortunately, the now overplayed Vertigo is the only track on this release that lives up to the hype. Much of the release is given over to Bono's sensitive side and his need to embrace humanity (which is a separate subject and worthy of extreme praise). I just wish he would separate his role as rock and roll lead from his other agendas. Maybe Henry Rollins was correct when he said that U2 has become a band old people who forgot how to rock listen to.
B00001OH7X|5.0|A few lps can leave such an impression that the day of it's release can be recalled 25 years later (damn!).  Me and Robin listening to the feature spot on the FSU radio station at 2am.  Went to the nearest record store the next day to get a copy.  There will never be another \\"African Night Flight\\" <br />I read an interview with Tony Visconti that all they could find while recording was white wine.  I also read that the Adrian Belew parts were recorded with Adrian arriving at the studio and being directed to a room to set up his epuipment.  A light came on when he was set up and a voice said \\"Play your guitar, Adrian\\" over a speaker.  Music started and he played.  After the track, the voice said \\"That's not good enough.  Try again.\\"  He never saw anyone throughout the entire session.  Even if it's not true, it's a great story.
B00005JLK1|3.0|After watching this movie I went to the documentary featurette and I was summarily dumbfounded to hear every cast member and producer, even the director, absolutely convinced that they were making a genuinely scary movie.  Well, the information is in...this movie is not scary at all.  The times when there is potential for a good fright the music swells prematurely or the camera movement changes slightly too soon warning the viewer that something is about to startle you.  Therefore, the moments are not startling.  The upsides to this film are that there are some decent visual effects and outstanding makeup effects that are effectively gory.  Many people, and many of the characters, die in interesting ways.  The gore factor in this film is top-notch!  The cast is also surprisingly good given they have yet another ghost story to inhabit; but they all come across as human, not super-human; although there is a Ripley-type lead character that will surely survive.  There is no telling which of the remaining characters will survive.  This movie is simply okay, invoking frequent cringes at all the gore but never ever an instance where the viewer is clutching at somebody else for security, being frightened in any way.  I recommend this film as a rental only, unless gory movies are your thing.
B00001OH7T|5.0|A friend went out of town and lent me her car. It had a cd player in it.  At the time, I had a pickup truck with a broken cassette player.  I got a copy of \\"Young Americans\\" on cd and played it in the car.  I went out and bought a new car.
B0006399FS|5.0|Maybe because I'm 19, I never got into u2 much.  But my cousin is a big fan and I have heard some of their albums.  This is by far the best one, I mean c'mon, its got 11 SOLID tracks.  The thing is it might not have that one blowout song that will take over the world.  But still, a really great CD. <br /> <br />Gems: Vertigo, Sometimes, All Because of You, Man and Woman, Crumbs. <br /> <br />The only two I haven't reached yet is One Step Closer and Yahweh.  Their good but you have to kind of bang your head against some of these tunes to really get into them. <br /> <br />For a band to be in their 40's or older (not sure of their age) and still get so much attention gets respect from me.  But to deserve that attention is even better.  big up _u2!!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|We needed a band like Franz Ferdinand, too pop to be indie, and too indie to be pop. <br /> <br />GREAT album, Michael is the best track, for it shows how much fun the boys are having.
B00005JMAH|1.0|The following views are told by the views of a dissapointed child who had their hopes and imaginations crushed by the terrible ideas in the recent movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; but the DVD features had also contributed to the strenuous amounts of dissapointment to the true, literal fans of Harry Potter and this movie had caused confusion to the non-fans as well, I hope that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will not sink as low as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, These are a few things that caused PoA to be terrible. <br />1. Harry used a lumos spell in his bedroom at the Dursleys house in Privet Drive, you are not supposed to use magic unless it was an emergency in front of muggles (it was not even in the book). <br />2. Aunt Marge floated out the door, when in the books, Aunt Marge was supposed to float towards the ceiling (talk about over acting). <br />3. The Knight Bus contained a shrunken head which was quite annoying, even in the DVD. Dobby was annoying too, but it was needed for the story to continue. Ernie Prang looks like someone's blind grandfatther and Stan Shunpike looked like a hobo or a bum living on the streets, the new hunchback Tom, the innkeeper looks like someone from the Addams' family. <br />4. Harry was supposed to receive The Monsters Book of Monsters from Hagrid at the Dursleys, but instead he got it in The Leaky Cauldron. <br />5. Lupin looks like an old man from the 1940's with a very aggrivating mustache. <br />6. The Sneakeoscope was not even shown in the movie, not even Pigwidgeon, or the owls that came to the Dursleys. <br />7. Dementors are not supposed to fly, they are suppossed to glide and water is not supposed to freeze when they come near. They are not supposed to chase Harry in the air during the Quidditch game. <br />8. The new Dumbledore and Trelawney looks like drugged-up hippies from the 1960's and Flitwick looks like a monk from the Dark Ages, what happened to our dear old Flitwick. Cornelius Fudge's new look reminds me of a character from the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. <br />9. New characters that do not even appear in the book suddenly appear in the movie with a much bigger role. <br />10. Buckbeak looks like a fake chicken and too much time was spent on Buckbeak's Flight, when Harry screamed out with his hands out, it reminded me of Titanic, \\"I'm King of the World.\\". <br />11. Things are pronounced incorrectly, like Expecto Patronum! and Boggart and Sir Cadogan. <br />12. The new Fat Lady was more obnoxious and so out of character, she was not supposed to sing. I miss the old Fat Lady from the 1st film, Sir Cadogan barely even had a role in this movie. <br />13. Students barely wore their robes, the robes made it feel more magical. Instead they wear crappy clothes, this is not a Gap commercial. <br />14. Draco was not supposed to give Harry an origami bird and neither should there be anyone struck by lightning. Students do not paint there face for a Quidditch game. <br />15. In the Marauder's showed rooms that did not even exist in the books and it was not supposed to show footsteps, it was only supposed to reveal a dot, and Peter Pettigrew was not supposed to show up on the map when Harry saw it. <br />16. The Firebolt scene was jumbled-up, looked even more beaten-up than the Nimbus 2000, and did not even show up until the final scene which made me want to vomit. <br />17. Trelawney's prediction was all wrong and looked fake as if she were going through a seizure. <br />18. Many parts of the story did not show up in the movie at all, like the argument about Crookshanks and Scabbers, Scabber's true identity, Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, Hermione purchasing Crookshanks and the books for the courses she was taking through her birthday money that her parents gave her, Sirius Black giving up his position as secret-keeper to Peter Pettigrew, Hermione leaving Muggle Studies class, Lavender Brown losing her baby bunny, Binky to a fox, Hermione's turn with a boggart, Lupin drinking the wolfsbane potion, Sirius Black breaking into the dormitory, Snape's version of Sirius, Lupin, James, and Peter and how he was almost killed by the whomping willow when it was set by sirius during the transformation, but James saved him, the marauders were unregistered animagus, and othere parts of the book that did not make it into the movie. <br />19. Honeydukes looks like a place where people smoke, sell, and buy drugs. Harry was not supposed to take the blood-flavored lollipop from Neville. The Shrieking Shack and other scenes were too rushed in this film. Harry's crying made me want to throw up. Harry was supposed to throw mud at Draco and his gang, but instead he threw snowballs at them. <br />20. Lupin looked like a hairless mexican dog when he transformed into a werewolf. <br />21. The sets (the whomping willow, too much time was spent when the birds kept hitting into the tree), scenery (Hagrid's hut was moved into a steep hill instead of the by the castle like it was supposed to.), locations, actors, and camera techniques changed. <br />22. The acting went from bad to worse, The dialogue went from terrible to horrible. There were too many instances with shrunken heads, mirror (reflections), time (growing up), giant pumpkins (Pumpkins cannot grow in Hagrid's Hut in June, it would have rotted there), and hideous dark crows. This movie tried to be funny, dark, creative, and different from the other Harry Potter films which ended up to be the worst Harry Potter film so far. This movie was too short, not literal, not accurate, and the director did not even read the Harry Potter books. <br />23. Hermione was not supposed to grab Ron's wrists, it is so wrong. There was not supposed to be anything between the 2. I felt as the director had decided to add fanfiction ideas and string up rumors that are not true. There are only 5 deleted scenes. Everything in the 1st 2 films were much longer. <br />24. Alfonso Cuaron should not be able to the direct any more Harry Potter films, Mike Newell is already wrecking Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire from what I have seen and heard of so far. I am hoping the director for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will do much better because so far, Harry Potter has been inking lower with each movie, I am afraid that the next Harry Potter film might bomb. My hope is quickly fading as I hear more about the next Harry Potter movie.I heard that this Harry Potter movie foreshadows events in the last 2 Harry Potter books, if that is true, then the 6th and 7th Harry Potter books will be ruined, Only time can only tell when I know what happens.
B0000C1733|3.0|those 2 are my favorate rhcp songs but i love the others. under the bridge is awesome.
B000003TAR|5.0|Unlike Nevermind, which basically everyone liked, In Utero is really just for Nirvana fans.  Other reviews criticize intentional production sloppiness and the abundance emotion.  That is the definition of pop, and Nirvana was not pop.   <br /> <br />The songs featured on this album, for the most part are great.  But as i said before, only a devout fan will want to listen to the songs multiple times.  Songs like Scentless Apprentice and Radio Friendly Unit Shifter are perfect examples of Nirvana's \\"goal\\": To play songs that weren't aimed at attracting screaming girls and eunterages.  If you liked their music, then you would listen.  If you hated their stuff, then don't listen.  It was that simple.  In this album, Nirvana wasn't trying to put off an image of anti-pop, contrary to popular belief.  They played songs and released them just for the sake of releasing their music.  If you're a fan, buy this album. <br /> <br />GREAT CD BUT ONLY FOR FANS
B000066NW0|5.0|I know in a past review I said that Avril[...] and that it was only a phase but I deleted it to redo the review.I was swayed by a lot of my friends and others saying she was a poser and that she sucked so I started to believe it.But then I remembered the CD.I began to listen to it again and I love it.I have a few friends that secretly like Avril Lavigne and she is a guilty pleasure for them and secretly I like her too.Her songs are so good and she sings just dandy.Before I said she sucks live but she must have been having a bad day because I heard her again on Oprah and she was amazing!2 years ago I got the Let Go CD for Christmas and this year I am going to get her new CD for Christmas as well.With the exception of Mobile and Unwanted all the songs are amazing.
B000003TA4|4.0|I am a huge Nirvana fan.  I have all of the albums.  This album is great.  It has Polly, a genious song.  Then there is Smells Like Teen Spirit, a song that was great.  But it got old, really fast.  It was really well performed, and it sounds great, but it's nowhere near where Nirvana's music genious truly was.  Songs like Polly, Come As You Are, Lithium and On a Plain are really what can be called genious.   <br /> <br />This CD was what Kurt Cobain tried to avoid, commercial pop.  All of the songs are completely pop oriented, and Kurt Cobain realized that.  That's why Incesticide and In Utero were completely different.  Kurt Cobain backed off on the pop in these albums and that is why they were so much better.  If i had to guess, this was Kurt Cobain's least favorite album, if that matters to anyone. <br /> <br />STILL A GREAT CD THOUGH, JUST NOT THE BEST OF NIRVANA
B000286S8S|5.0|I thought that a real Van Halen Greatest Hits CD would never be made. I already own their Best Of Volume 1 CD, and I recently bought this from this very site. I like the new and live songs. The live ones sound good, whether Dave or Sammy are doing the vocals. Sammy's rant in \\"Panama\\" was a little long, but it didn't bother me. The only complaint is that the CD should've had the songs in chronological order. Other than that, it's great.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Nirvana is the greatest band ever.  The Beatles, Hendrix, Allman Bros., none of these people compare.  What made Nirvana the best was not their how talented they were at their instruments.  The songs they played were the best.  <br /> <br />This CD is great for a new listener.  It has the best of all their albums like Nevermind, In Utero and MTV Unplugged.  The songs are all great, especially You Know You're Right, which the day it was released went to 3rd most popular national song for weeks.  Because the best of all the CD's are in this album, it is my favorite.  I love Nirvana's other albums, but this was my first CD.  Ever since i got it, Nirvana is all i listen to. <br /> <br />Those who aren't dedicated fans should get this CD just to get the best of Nirvana without getting the other albums. <br /> <br />Fans, get this CD because it is the only CD with You Know You're Right.   <br /> <br />GREAT CD
B0006399FS|1.0|Finally the truth comes out, isn't it Bono ? <br />Please stop pretending this album is fantastic, because it's clear it isn't. <br />Silly instant soup for silly teenagers.
B00005JNDX|2.0|Something happened between this film and the original that I just cannot put my finger on. Was it the actors feeling like they were too comfortable in their roles? Maybe. Was it the unchallenging story that fell too clearly into a clich&eacute;d moment than a fun film? Maybe. Was it the random exploits of our character that pulled us away from her and into a world that we were unfamiliar with? Maybe. Was it the lackluster music that filled my ears with pain instead of enjoyment? Maybe. It could possibly be one of these options or all of them, but when I walked out of the theater, I didn't feel the same excitement as I did when I walked out of the theater for the first one. Bridget had changed (or maybe it was me, but for the sake of argument I will say Bridget), and it wasn't for the better.<br /><br />Let me explain my four points from above a bit clearer to see if anyone can help me discover what went wrong in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. First, the comfort level of the actors. To begin, did Renee look bigger in this film. In the first film she was plump-cute, in this film she seems just plump-plump. She seemed to just stroll through her lines not giving us half the emotion or excitement as she did in the original. Instead of building upon Bridget Jones, Zellweger just gave us a recycled version of the original Bridget Jones, jokes and all. She was just the same as the original. Nothing new was created, but more was destroyed. Firth was equally as bad (GASP for me to say that), but he just never came out of his shell. In the original I wanted Jones to be with him by the end and in this film I just didn't care. He felt and seemed cold-hearted, even in all of his emotional moments. I wanted his character to be over-the-top instead of under-the-weather. Finally, there was Hugh Grant, so literally just didn't care about this film at all. There was no passion in his eyes or any magic in his words. Together this troupe made an unfunny film where they attempted to pull everything back from the original. The book was not the same as the original, so why should this be?<br /><br />This leads me into my second point regarding the unchallenging story. It seemed and felt as if Zellweger was falling her paces instead of leading her character. The events that surrounded her seemed so surreal that I never really felt as if they were happening to her. Somewhere near the center of this film we go from personal story to fantasy. The fact that the director could only tell us with Darcy did for Jones proved that money and creativity were lacking in this sequel. The director obviously did not have a very good grasp on this film, and it was obvious from the beginning to the end. The entire Rebecca moments were laughable and unemotional. I needed a dramedy instead of a silly-goofy film. Who felt as if the fight between Darcy and Cleaver was two men looking to get paid instead of act. Why was this scene even in this film? I can tell you why, it is because women love Firth and Grant fighting and the studio executives wanted to pull those same women back into the audience. Well, couldn't we be more original and find someone else to fight? Apparently not as we are forced to uncomfortably sit through two hours of repetitive motions that we had already seen from the original. URG!<br /><br />Third and I know this is something that we probably couldn't avoid because it was in the book, but the change of scenery was pointless. I like Jones in her environment, London, it allows her humor to come from inside instead of from her 'wacky' expeditions. The ski trip moment was horrible. I even felt awkward throughout it. It just showed me that there was more money and more ability to travel. Did anyone else seem to notice that the prison seemed awfully glossed over? This is built another level to disappointment that I was already feeling from this film. Why did we have to butcher a great character with sight gags? Bridget Jones is not a sight gag person, it is her uncanny passion that makes her funny, not putting her butt in pig feces.<br /><br />Finally, there was the music. In the original the music complimented the film. In Edge of Reason, it only detracts us from the film. It is the most random chaotic choices encountered in a film. From classic oldies to modern pop, Bridget Jones changed before my own eyes as a wanna-be music video and platform for those that want to get ahead. If it was going to be a repetitive film like the first was, where was 'It's Raining Men'. That would have at least made me chuckle. Instead, there was some American-ized Christina Aguleria/Pink wanna-be blasting her song in this very British film. Chalk this one up to yet another disaster brought about by this director. Did she even see the original? The music failed in this sequel, causing a distressed viewer run back and rewatch the original.<br /><br />Overall, this was a horrible remake. Jen seemed to feel the same, but still found it enjoyable to purchase when it is released. I felt as if there was something missing. Bridget Jones is not one that needs to change for a new generation, and I felt this is what director Beeban Kidron did. She tried to make her perkier, plumper, and hipper. Bridget Jones is a character that is supposed to speak to women in the audience by her awkward behavior and passion for love, but instead what I witnessed (and I think the women will agree) was an actress packing on more weight than needed to gain the sympathy of anyone in the audience. She put no emotion behind her character, nor did anyone else involved. This felt like a painful sequel, and it was obvious that nobody was fully behind it.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****is her uncanny passion that makes her funny, not putting her butt in pig feces. <br /> <br />Finally, there was the music.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|The day I purchased this CD I listened to it eight times in a row and it got better with each listen.  The sheer musical texture of drums, guitar, cello, blended vocals, syths, violin, viola, synth, etc. is stunningly beautiful and nearly overwhelming.  This album is on the level of Radiohead's OK Computer: a musical achievement that will endure as an album to own for years to come.  I've seen The Arcade Fire in concert earlier this month and I just bought tickets to another show in January.  I am as excited, if not more excited, for that show as I am for seeing The Pixies.  This band is something remarkable.
B0006399FS|5.0|The album is very U2ish and Bono bluntly (or at least more than their other albums) displays his spirituality and convictions. Im suprised that some people call the lyrics effusive and all about him. Though Im sure they would take that back if they saw a victem of Aids, which i think \\"Miracle Drug\\" talks about. <br />Overall an amazin album that IS U2
B00004YA66|5.0|I've been a fan of Dennis Quaid through some good movies and some not-so-good movies, but here is a role just perfect for him, as a 1969 NY fire fighter.  Jim Caviezel is great as his cynical, 36-year old son in the parallel 1999 storyline.  The time bridge is well done [willing suspension of disbelief required, but easy here] and the palpable link between father and son -- the son's loss at his father's early death -- is heartbreaking but ultimately life-affirming.  Buy it, rent it, borrow it -- but see it.  You'll be on the edge of your seat, but the payoff at the end is worth it.
B00028HBKC|1.0|You fools so you beleave in god well your being played like a puppet on a string.If you look at the size of our plannet compared to the rest of the known univers it isn't even a grain of sand on the eaths serface.So if  your going to beleive in something as stupid as jesus and god you might as well beleive in something slightly more relistic like aliens.This movie is a prime e.g of how stupid the masses realy are and how thay can be conned into almost anything.If your going to rent or buy a religious movie i suggest Monty Pithons Life Of Brien it makes a hell of a lot more sense.
B00005JMAH|3.0|First the good:  Alfonso Cuaron did a great job directing this film.  He really taps into the growing talent of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint pushing them to even more emotional and dramatic acting.  Now the bad:  this was a very poor adpatation of Rowling's book.  One does not expect a word for word re-creation of the novel, but a better job than this choppy version would have been nice.  Azkaban was not one of the larger books so one has to wonder what they'll do with the door-stop size novels that follow.  Of course, the effects are great, especially Buckbeak. I also thought Michael Gambon did an excellent job stepping into the shoes of Richard Harris.  Gambon's Dumbledore is different, but keeps much of the loveable wickedness from the novels.  The same cannot be said of Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and David Thewlis as Remus Lupin.  Their performances were weak and lacked much of the passion from the novels.  Of course, if you're a Harry Potter fan, this may make no difference.  Either way, it is a good film on its own merits.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Notice all reviews on the first page are 4 or 5 stars.  Any that you see are full of crap and need exactly what chris says about before gary goes into the bar.  \\"if you mess this up ill rip off your Ba**s and shove them up your A** so the next time you take a Sh** you'll Sh** all over your Ba**s\\". I say the movie twice.  My friend went to see it with his parents.  They thought it was hilarious and they are the strictest parents i know.  Kim jung ll steals the show with his speech impediment.  The movie take hards shots at many celebratys such as george clooney, liv tyler, helen hunt, samuel l. jackson, and susan sarandon.  They are all part of the film actors guild or F.A.G. <br />Vry hilarious with loads of terriorists and micheal moore and puppets.  Go see the movie.  Even if your only going to see the puppet sex.
B00009RDGA|5.0|Everything comes together--direction, writing, casting, cinematography, performances, music...right down to the last prop-- for this triumphant picture by Peter Bogdanovich and Company.<br /><br />The Director's Commentary track is fantastic and will probably entice you to put Bogdanovich on your list of \\"Most Sought After Dinner Party Guest.\\"  His stories are as entertaining as they are enlightening.<br /><br />The O'Neals and the late Madeline Kahn...all perfection in this timeless classic.
B0002HYC8C|5.0|We saw this out of the box at our local specialty toy shop, my son is eleven, but wants the newly updated big pirate ship, but this boat is HUGE! It would make a great toy for the pool as it floats as well, the animals are great, but we already have most of the playmobil animals, as we have ordered them as \\"add ons\\" from the company! This boat is so cool!  Playmobil is so terrific, and our three boys have played with it for years, the castles, western forts and pirates. My son takes the ships and boats outside in the summer and floats them in the pool with playmobil guys and his GI joes too. I have been buying Playmobil for the boys for years, and I guarantee that it is the one toy that your kids will stick with well past Christmas, yes, we buy hotwheels, action figures, but legos and playmobil are what they stay with, in the long run.
B000002J09|4.0|Zeppelins 4th album , unlike its three predicessors actually is for the most part written by none other than... Led Zeppelin... with a few exeptions of course . First the good news : Battle of Evermore and Going Too California are great acoustic pieces, the former featuring Sandy Denny from Fairport Convention and the Strawbs. Four Sticks is sort of this hypnotic thing - its great, and Misty Mountain Hop is pretty good too. Now for the bad news:<br />Black Dog is a great song - its modeled after Fleetwood Macs<br /> \\"Oh Well \\" - if you listen to a live version of Macs  its basically the same song . Is it plagurism ? Absoluley not. Is it an original idea for a song ? Absolutley not. Let me point out that this is hardly in the same class as their earlier plagurisms but they still seem to have this odd penchant for borrowing OTHER PEOPLES MUSIC.<br />Rock and Roll is great too - like the drum intro ? its classic.<br />It also happens to be the intro to Little Richards \\" Keep a<br />Knockin\\" - no big deal its just the intro.<br />When the Levee Breaks is an old blues song by Memphis Minnie -<br />but they do include her on the liner credits - no problem - its just not their song.<br />And last but not least Stairway to Heaven . For anyone who'se<br />ever picked up a guitar , the first thing you wanna do is try to<br />pick out the notes to the intro to Pages Stairway ... uh...<br />unfortunatley the intro happens to be a song by Spirit ( a band<br />the group toured with ) , called Taurus. If you can try to get a hold of this - its pretty amazing to hear the original. By the<br />way the title isnt quite original either , its taken from the<br />Neil Sedaka hit from 1960 called.... Stairway To Heaven .<br />All in all Zepp IV is a good album - its just that they have this weird penchant for stealing  OTHER PEOPLES MUSIC .
B00020HEG6|5.0|Williams has still got it!!! I have the Chamber of Secrets, but I wasn't impressed. This album is fantastic! It is everything that I wanted, great music! One of the reasons that I think this one is so good is that it useds many odd (but beautiful) instruments. It is worth the money! (\\"Double Trouble\\" is Great!!!)
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 has once again blessed music with another masterpiece. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb ranks up with U2's greats. Here is a simple breakdown of the songs. <br /> <br />Vertigo (9.5) - the best U2 opener since Where the Streets Have No Name from the Joshua Tree. Fast, powerful, and energetic. It is the absolute perfect way to start off an album <br /> <br />Miracle Drug (9.5) - upon first listen this one doesnt sound good after Vertigo but after a while you begin to realize that it is an all around beautiful song. The Edge's guitar work has never been better and the somber melody hits you in a way in which you appreciate it after it is over <br /> <br />Sometimes You Cant Make It On Your Own (10) - the best song on the album and one of the best of U2's career. Bono has never, in my opinion, sung with more passion and the lyrics match One as the most well written U2 song.  <br /> <br />Love and Peace Or Else (9.5) - this is really the only politcal statement on the album. its a very different type of U2 song but using larry's thumping beats, the edge's hardcore guitar work, and the total production of Lillywhite, U2 once again manages to enter new ground to create a political masterpiece. <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights (9.5) - i must admit that upon first listen this one did not strike me as all that great. but it grows on you and now i would rank it in the top 5 on the album. once again The Edge's guitar steals the musical aspect of the song but Bono's voice carries the number and makes it as exciting and fast paced a song as any U2 song ever  <br /> <br />All Because of You (9) - after Vertigo you find yourself waiting for another fast paced hard rocker. when you reach track 6 it hits you like a ton of bricks. the hard driving rhythm guitar (supplied by Bono) is the foundation and its backed by a bass line thats to kill for.  <br /> <br />A Man and a Woman (9) - once again U2 enters new ground. the boys go a little bit more acoustic and Larry provides a nice R&B beat. Bono's voice carries over into parrallel dimensions here and this is the song where you start to realize that these guys can basically tackle anything that comes their way. <br /> <br />Crumbs From your Table (8.5) - this song is an all around good song. its one you can just really rock out too. it wont be a hit single from the boys but it will give you just what your looking for in a U2 song. Edge's guitar work sounds awfully similar to that in Walk On. <br /> <br />One Step Closer (8) - the weakest song on the album and it wont hold the attention of some of you for long but I personally enjoyed it. it sounds a little bit unfinished and you can hear some parts that could have been better but the lyrics are incredible and the intro alone is worth the listen. <br /> <br />Original of the Species (9.5) - many people dont like this song however i find it to be one of the more rewarding tracks here. the chorus is simply masterful and the Beatle-esque melody is slightly humorous. Larry's drumming has never sounded better or more crisp. <br /> <br />Yahweh (9.5) - incredible upgrade for closing track from their previous closer Grace. this song gives us the religous aspect of U2 that we're all used to but in a much faster and guitar driven way. strip this song of Edge's guitar work and its nothing, although Bono's voice (especially in the chorus) is exceptionally powerful. <br /> <br />U2 has never sounded better. I feel that this album needs to be listened to more to be appreciated and in a few years it will be regarded as one of their best. You people giving it a bad name will be proven wrong in a few years. As with all of U2's great albums this one needs time to grow and to be realized as a truly great masterpiece. Thats what U2 wants. You haters need to look at that a little more closely.  <br /> <br /> <br />
1857026691|3.0|A good historical account on a topic in Maths Number Theory. Fermats last theorem showing even those good at maths can also struggle with the subject albeit on a different level <br /> <br />Fermat presented his famous and what looked to be a simple equation, and asked mathematicians of his time to prove it, like he said he could. He never showed anyone how to and it is doubtful that he could, probably only proving it for n=3 &/or n=4. <br /> <br />The book then charts through history those mathematicians that made contributions to the proving of the equation <br /> <br />A good historical account but not exactly riveting, compounded by the fact that the average reader would'nt have a hope in hell of ever understanding the maths involved in proving the theory (thankfully not shown in the book), combined with the knowledge that 'maths hardest problem' is so abstract it doesn't have many practical uses <br /> <br />At least in Singhs next book, 'The Code Book' one can relate to and use many of the discoveries within the book
B0006399FS|4.0|A previous reviewer called out us \\"old farts\\" to get with the program when evaluating the new U2 album. This old fart, like many others, has mixed feelings about \\"Bomb\\". <br /> <br />After several listenings, although none straight through Vertigo through Yahweh, I have concluded that this is one of U2's better albums. Is it Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby? Nope. The album \\"Bomb\\" most reminds me of is \\"Unforgettable Fire\\", which I still have trouble listening to uninterrupted. <br /> <br />Like \\"Fire\\", \\"Bomb\\" has only one track that jumps right out at you (Vertigo and Pride). But U2 is and always has been a live band, and what you hear on record is NOT what you get in concert. I remember listening to ATYCLB many, many times and concluding that it was a weak album, only to see them on the Elevation tour and have many of the same songs (especially Walk On) completely blow me away in concert. I can sense the same potential with \\"Bomb\\", but even more so as Edge's guitar has a much more prominent role than in ATYCLB. <br /> <br />In some ways, this album almost harkens back to Joshua Tree. Each time I listen the album as a whole grows on me. Many of my favorites on Joshua were never released as singles (Red Hill Mining Town, Trip Through Your Wires, In God's Country), and I can see the same potential here. This album, though it appears slick and well-produced, will grow on you. Don't miss it when performed live.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Like its predecessors \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Stargate,\\" Roland Emmerich's \\"The Day After Tomorrow features state-of-the-art special effects, detailing the devastation, both human and architectural, from the onslaught of major climactic changes.  However, the sfx take a back seat to the human drama unfolding among the characters.<br /><br />Sure, it's hokey and commonplace, at times, but sometimes such structured and familiar situations are a necessity for movie audiences.  Who can't help but cheer climatologist/father Dennis Quaid as he seeks to rescue his son, trapped in the library during a major ice \\"hurricane\\"?  Who can't be moved by the courage of Sela Ward as she remains behind with a bedridden cancer-stricken child as everyone else in her hospital abandons them for the safety of southern locales?  Who can't be amused by Glenn Plummer, cast as a homeless citizen, that spouts some of the film's funniest and poignant lines?  Who cannot be sympathetic for Ian Holm and company as they sit in their weather monitoring station, awaiting impending doom and thinking of the loved ones that they will leave behind?<br /><br />Even Jake Gyllenhaal's \\"Sam\\" is heroic as he attempts to save himself and the rest of the library's inhabitants from the dropping temperatures and a pack of marauding wolves that had escaped from a city animal compound.<br /><br />When the movie was first released, I opted not to see it, thinking that the imagined destruction of New York following the real-life collapse of The Twin Towers was a little unsympathetic to those that experienced the tragedy.  However, after allowing the passage of time, I can now view the film a bit more open-mindedly for what the producers/director intended: mostly entertainment with a bit of science thrown in, coupled with the best of humanity as it seeks to survive overwhelming odds.<br /><br />And, I suppose, that's all that one can expect from a true popcorn flick.
B0006FO9J2|5.0|I have seen this \\"History of Iron Maiden - The Early Days\\" DVD already for sale at several music retailers (for one third the price Amazon has it listed for, there must be an error of some sort) <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the early Paul DiAnno/Bruce Dickinson era of Maiden, then this DVD is a MUST!!! I had the 1981 \\"Live at the Rainbow\\" concert on VHS, as with most old VHS tapes, my copy had deteriorated, glad to now have it on DVD, not to mention the other DiAnno era shows I had never even seen before, the 90 minute in-depth documentary is also great, several interviews with early band members including DiAnno, Dennis Stratton, Clive Burr, and many many more.  <br /> <br />I can't wait to see the next installment. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 knows how to do music. I think I can understand how some people don't like this album, but not really. The lyrics are very poetic some of the time and hard to understand, but if you look past them and just listen, its an amazing ride. Bono is staying strong at his age, and I'm so happy that U2 is still putting out stuff this good. Look at how many reviews this album has already, around 350 when i wrote this, and how long has the album been out? a couple of weeks maybe. Very worth adding to your collection of U2. that is if you don't already own it.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This weekend I watched all three Harry Potter films back-to-back.  Each was excellent in its own right, but the third film is noticably different and better.  While \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" greatly improved on the first, the new direction of The Prisoner of Azkaban made it much more whole. <br />While I greatly missed the Quidditch matches (they were supposed to win the Quidditch cup this year) and the absence of Oliver Wood, the film was excellent.  The actors have grown into their roles and their abilities shine on the screen.  Gambdon's replacing Richard Harris as Dumbledore was brilliant casting.   <br />Unlike the first two films, which seemed to drag at points, this one glides through the story, never missing a beat.  There's great humor in the dialogue, and the relationships between the characters really comes through.  Cuaron focused more on the students rather than the faculty this time around, letting them take center stage.   <br />The CGI is brilliant---gone are the too-fast moving CGI characters and the monsters that are supposed to look real but are too polished.  Buckbeak is animated beautifully and was a character all its own.  The Quidditch sequence, while short, was well-produced as well.  Not using it as much and shooting on location shoots worked great because it didn't look like they were standing in front of a green screen.   <br />Overall, it's the best Harry Potter yet, and I can't wait for the next installment.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'm giving my review from a christian's point of view. I think that this movie is pretty realistic in showing the last hours of Jesus' life. It's very sad to see your savior ( although yes it is just a movie ) being tortured. I'm not going to say how anyone who thinks this is rubbish is a bad person or make any judgement on them, you believe what you want, we are givin that choice to do so. I choose to believe this so don't judge me for doing so... but I thank God for dying for my sins, and this is an accurate viewing of what may have gone down at that time.
B0006399FS|2.0|U2 is bigger than life, and they have grown to such proportions that they are not human people, but black shadows dancing on colored backgrounds on TV. They are an icon and a juggernaut that  can sell music, fight aids, fund amnesty int. and other charitable organizations. Many listeners even sought their music for comfort after the Sept 11 incident. Their good will and philanthropy can't be disputed, but their music can be. <br /> <br />Better luck next time, U2. I wanted to like this album. The song Vertigo is great, but a little too polished. It gets better with each listen, while the rest of the album gets worse with each listen. It's full of crooning, semi-ballads that are oozing with pompous bombast ideal for audiences in baseball stadium sized concerts. On a VH1 commercial, they said that when they play in concerts, this is where they live, the band being a band. And this is true. The album is grandiose like a stadium concert should be. And that's ok to do, since U2 is known for their concerts, but in this case, it falls flat because it lacks real passion and they try too hard to appeal to the listener, which is themselves. It is too radio ready, and very clean and over produced to really sound interesting from 500 other bands out there doing the same thing. Buy something from an independent label and go to a real show in a small place where you can see the band, not a stadium sized massive thing that costs over $100. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: Borrow it or download it before you buy it used.
B000066BYE|5.0|great album but why do you think it's a b-sides... it's all the songs that didn't really fit into the other albums.. so the cd doesn't flow together as well as the other 2or3 muse albums.. yet, the live version is brilliant and there are some really good songs on the b sides cd. definately worth buying especially if ur a muse fan.
B000669GAI|5.0|The difference between 'Greatest Hits' and 'The Best Of' is considerable. Greatest hits implies the most successful songs, whereas Best Of gives the artist more freedom to choose their best, in their opinion. I see many reviews complaining that PJ have always tried to defy the mainstream, and this is exactly the opposite. Well, the most successful songs would be mainstream, therefore rightly earning their place on this cd.<br /><br />If this was a Best Of cd I would expect to see PJ release many songs that casual fans wouldn't know, going against the mainstream, and probably dissapointing more than this cd. Even though the 4.5 star average shows that dissapoitment is in the minority.<br /><br />Simply this album contains PJ's most popular songs, mostly from their earlier hits such as Ten and Vs. To complain that PJ should have released an album with different unreleased songs is absurd, this is The Greatest Hits, not The Anti-Mainstream Hits that obviously many wanted.
B00068IOWM|5.0|I found myself falling in love with this album each and everytime Ive played it. Just when I thought Miracle Drug was the best piece, City of Blinding Lights takes over. I then suddenly get caught up with Original of the Species and find it to be the best. Hours of enjoyable listening later Sometimes You Cant Make it on Your Own takes over me. Then once again Crumbs from your Table pops up and I cant help but put it on top. I finallly then come to the realization that this is the first album in any genre for quite some time that has almost every song on it totally lisentable and great. Dont leave this one behind!
B000000993|5.0|Apart from the raging EP Opiate, Undertow has to be Tools most raw work. Which, incidentally is not a bad thing. Listening to the old Tool in comparison to their latest Lateralus, only one thing sounds similar, MJK's voice. Undertow has a very `grungy' feel to it, muddy guitars encapsulate the harsh environment, tipped off by MJK's familiar roar.<br /><br />Undertow starts with a bang, Intolerance is a superb, and vastly underrated song. It spirals in between crunching guitar riffs and the ever-haunting vocals. It puts you straight into the depths of Undertow, MJK seduces you with his soft, peaceful voice, only to get ripped to shreds in a matter of seconds. Haunting is the general theme here, and Prison Sex catches it perfectly with it's harrowing lyrics about child abuse, and Tool's main asset, the creation of a very dark, sinister environment. Sober is easily the best song on Undertow, and amongst Tool's finest work. The guitar playing is outstanding; Adam Jones has one of his finest moments in Tool discography. Other noteworthy songs are the impeccable Bottom, and the almost up-beat Undertow.<br /><br />Do not expect to get into this album after one listen. Like every Tool cd, it takes time. Undertow less though compared to Tool's latter, and in my opinion better, albums. Nonetheless, this is a fine rock album, worthy of a place in your collection.
0784011176|3.0|The costuming was lovely, the style, tone, message and imagery were certainly striking... and all of these things cause me to give this highly acclaimed movie three stars. On the other hand, the actual story and acting in this movie would have earned it two or two and a half points, at best. The story is a little disjointed in places, trying to break itself into segments dotted with scenes with characters I never really understood or got involved in (the tribe, the sisters and eccentric uncle figure).  <br /> <br />My true grievance lies with the main characters themselves, and the awkward dialogue and behavior they have been written to convey. Our main character doesn't exactly inspire any compassion, care or interest, as she behaves like a spoiled and arrogant looney at times, who has little to no concern for her daughter when things aren't going the way she wants them to. It's difficult to place the point when she decides she's feeling love or attraction, as almost all of her voiceless expressions are inundated with contempt or disdain. The young daughter is probably the most authentic and well-acted of all of the characters.  <br /> <br />The scenes meant to horrify and stun the viewer are almost more bizarre than anything else. And the ending of the movie was anti-climatic and stunted. To be completely honest, I find it hard to be impressed by the artistic and symbolic nature of a film when the acting is so flat, and the story so emotionally unreal. I would not purchase or watch this movie again, and I do not agree with the 3.5 out of 4.0 stars that my cable company rated it. I deeply respect what the creators of this story were attempting to convey. I only wish they would have done it in a more feeling, believable way...
B00008S2VG|5.0|This anti-war album was not very successful in the USA. If you aren't a huge Madonna fan, you'll probably only know of two or three songs from this album. I like every song in this album - and it's a shame that it was not a success.  <br />1. American Life 5/5 <br />The first single off the album. I love this song and the ORIGINAl music video makes it 100x better - unfortuneatly Madonna pulled the video from airplay in the USA. I just really like this song, it may have been a bad choice to start off the album during \\"hard times\\" in America.  <br />2. Hollywood 5/5 <br />The second single off the album. I first heard this song televised on MTV's 2oo3 VMA's. The version Madonna song, was much better than the LP version in my opinion. (The remix- Jacques lu Conts Thin White Duck Mix can be found on the Hollywood CD-Single.)  <br />3. I'm So Stupid 5/5 <br />The beat is amazing in this song. The only part that annoys me is when it sounds like it's skipping at the beginning when she first says \\"I'm so stupid.\\" <br />4. Love Profusion 5/5 <br />The fourth single. I don't like the video, but this upbeat pop song is just great.  <br />5. Nobody Knows Me 5/5 <br />This club song is really catchy. The ending bridge is so catchy... \\"I don't watch TV...\\" Love it. <br />6. Nothing Fails 5/5 <br />This was the third single, but it had no video. It's a ballad with a gospel vibe, kind of like the much more upbeat \\"Like A Prayer\\" hit. I love this song, as do many other fans. <br />7. Intervention 5/5 <br />8. X-Static Process 5/5 <br />The 2 latter songs I confuse a lot. But I love them both. They sound kind of alike. They are not club songs - they are slow ballads. Love them. <br />9. Mother and Father 5/5 <br />This was rumored to be the final single off of the album. It's another club song dedicated to who else, but Madonna's parents.  <br />10. Die Another Day 5/5 <br />The theme song to the James Bond movie. It's really catchy and one of my favorite songs off of the album. <br/>11. Easy Ride 5/5 <br />At first I always skipped this track, but a few weeks ago I gave it a try and I loved it! It's a slow ballad and it's so fun to sing. <br /> <br />As you may have noticed I gave every song a 5/5. It was well deserved to be a success in the US, but unfortuneatly none of the singles did very well due to the controversy. I advise u to buy this album.
B0006399FS|4.0|While it would be sheer hypocrisy to brazenly proclaim that HTDAAB is another Joshua Tree, it does, however, bear a faint resemblance to the incomparably masterful album.  Those, suffice it to say, looking for something poppy akin to Zooropa will be sorely disappointed.  Conversely, those looking for the more soulful and introspective U2 lyricism that has been sorely lacking of late will, without a doubt, find this new offering highly refreshing and enjoyable.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This \\"documentary\\" is nothing but propaganda devoid of any real facts.  Michael Moore once again made money off the stupidity of the American people.  People who are stupid enough to believe this crap.  If you liked this, and by some miracle, believed it, watch FahrenHYPE 9/11 which shows exactly how Moore twisted the \\"facts\\" in this movie.
0446310786|4.0|Like many of the reviewers i had to read this book at school,and was not looking forward to it. But to my suprise ,i found it really refreshing and after a slow start ,i really got into it. It is a truthful and  definetly a book for those who are openminded and understanding. Although it gives a rough description of the south,it doesn't make the south seem unpleasant but just illustrates the racism ,predudice and class system that exists to this very day. I will keep this book with me for times to come,a definete classic for all ages.
0060987464|4.0|instead I stayed glued to the TV set as Manson poured over \\"the beautiful people\\" and I ate crunchies on my couch. I watched, disgusted and bewildered. I wondered who would buy this man/chick, whatevers stuff. Then this book landed in my lap. Like the song that night, I opened the book looking to find something that I don't like. I found myself. Addicted, I turned the pages and read the book, amazed at the intelligence this man must possess. His look into the childhood and his evolvment as well as his side of the story made me realize that he is not unlike myself in many ways. I am a better person for having read his story. Great job!
B0001NBMEE|5.0|The splendid saga of the young Scandinavian prince is told with efficency and directorial maestry  . He enters the court of King Arthur and returns his family to their throne , restoring his birthright.<br /><br />Henry Hataway in one his best works with ravishing photography and admirable and easy going script.<br /><br />A family entertainment and a superb cast .
B00068IOWC|5.0|Terrific!!! 11 absolutely different tracks, each of them with its special zest. And it feels like every song on the album can be a single. There's everything on this record -  stunning guitar riffs on the 'elevation'-like 'Vertigo' and a rock'n'roll 'Love and Peace or Else', sensitive and touching lyrics like in 'Miracle Drug' and 'Some Times You Can't Make it on your Own', Bono's heart-rending vocal and falsettos in 'Original of the Species' and 'One Step Closer'... and there is something that makes you want to listen to the songs again and again and find something new about every song each time you listen to it. It is a very U2 record and yet it's different from what we've heard before.  <br />DVD also contains some interesting stuff on how the record was made. It reminds me of a Rattle and Hum video with bits of interviews and studio performings.  <br />For the next couple of months it's going to be the only album for me to listen and enjoy and laugh and cry and dream.....
0800177177|5.0|This is a smart retelling of the Dracula legend but with a great difference . Coppola focuses his attention in the origin of the story back to the XV century in Rumania according to the directing spirit of Bram Stoker.<br /><br />Coppola not only turns an interesting device in the sequence when the doctor makes the blood analysis and it is shown to the viewer the clear reference to HIV . The directorial refinement of Coppola once more  makes it feel in his personal homage to Jean Cocteau 's Beauty and the beast and Polanski's Repulsion in the high tension of Dracula behind Ryder in the house , when invisible arms try to catch her .<br /><br />His sight to the Victorian London is simply exquisite. The dialogues are impregnated with sexual references and the frustration and the double moral are suggested with delicacy and fineness with that European taste and the obvious influence of an Italian film maker who has always been the special guide , not only for Coppola , but also to Scorsese : Luchino Visconti<br /><br />In the other hand the artistic direction is visually stunning . Gary Oldman made the most convincing acting in his brilliant career . Wynona Ryder was fantastic too .<br /><br /> Fortunately to us Coppola made his most powerful film in the nineties throwing his hat in the ring with this picture and reminding us he is one of the top masters of the directorial office .
B00005JKN9|5.0|I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did.  I realize that Scorsese takes some historical liberties with the plotline but everything about Tammany Hall was interesting to me.  I know that the director had been thinking about making Gangs for a couple of decades and his long-term planning certainly paid off.  I've seen it twice but both times I rewound to see the first fifteen minutes again as the introduction is absolutely priceless.  There are few better fight scenes that can be found than the one in the beginning of \\"Gangs of New York\\" where Lewis and his Natives square off with Neeson and his Dead Rabbits.  It's visually stunning.<br /><br />Personally, I now view Daniel Day-Lewis as being the world's greatest living actor.  For a refined, artistocratic Englishman to put forth such a magnificent, and buyable, performance as a maniacal killer was truly amazing.  Even his accent was perfect.  I can't say enough about his skills and presence.<br /><br />In juxtaposition, while Lewis is outstanding, Leonardo DiCaprio manages not to impress.  He is average in this role and really, when considering the talent around him, is actually a disappointment.  To me, the love story between DiCaprio and Diaz was the low point, in an otherwise stupendous, film.
B000099T2L|4.0|This is a very good solo debut album. Thats what I thought until I came to \\"Hip Hop Star\\". That one partictular song just ruins the album. It sounds like shes moaning, and the first thing I think of when I hear moaning is sex and Im pretty sure thats also what most guys think of too. Im a girl and I dont want to be thinking of sex just because of the way a song s being sung.
B00008RH3L|5.0|I always tell people that this is my favorite Coen Brothers movie and they usually think I'm nuts, but their 1990 release far surpasses everything they did before or since in the quality of its plot structure and dialogue.  I just saw it for the sixth or seventh time and still am amazed by some of the lines that were said.  Gabriel Byrne is absolutely incredible and his relationship with Myrna is believable and thoroughly entertaining.  The plot turns and twists reminded me of \\"House of Games.\\" As far as film noir is concerned, this film deserves to be right up there with \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"The Big Sleep.\\"
B000068R1X|4.0|this like ultimate sin is more hard rock than metal but ozzy makes hard rock actually cool this was his first album with jake e lee one of my favorite guitarist alltime instead of silly little tricks and lame tapping that appeals to 15 year olds like randy rhodes did jake e lee has well thought out cool solos and never does more than the song needs my 2 favorite songs on here are waiting for darkness and bark at the moon this album isnt as good as the next one ultimate sin but its still good and shouldnt be overlooked
B000002542|5.0|I was seventeen when I went to my first concert.  Pablo Cruise, Journey, and Robin Trower at Winterland in San Francisco.  I went for Trower, but the next day was at the Record Factory buying this Journey album.  In the liner notes it has instructions to play the album at the highest possible volume to fully appreciate the sound of Journey.  I did then and I still do now.  In the Bay Area, I was lucky enough to see this version of the band nine times before Steve Perry and twice with him.  Bless Perry for making everybody rich (which is great), but the original Journey, for my money was the greatest thing I have ever seen in Rock music.  I've been to hundreds of concerts through the years and the best shows I've seen were the one's where they toured for the first three albums.  Of a Lifetime remains my alltime favorite rock song.  Neal Schon plays on this album with a brilliance and controlled fury unlike anything I've heard him or anybody else do since.  And it isn't just Neal that makes this album so special, it's the toal interaction of the band on all instruments and vocals.  I wore out three vinyls, an 8-track, and a cassette of this album with multiple listenings.  Thank goodness for CD's.  In my opinion, this is the best rock album of all time.  Just my opinion, don't get excited everybody.
B000002B7O|5.0|first off let me say i love randy rhodes he was very very good but hes not the greatest guitarist alltime he wasnt even the greatest of his era HE WAS BECOMING GREAT then died shortly after this album was released this album has alot of killer songs like believer over the mountain and the long and depressing diary of a madman i actually like this better than the overplayed blizzard of oz and if u havent heard this in awhile or at all buy this cd and hear randy rhodes last work before death and some of ozzys most underated songs
B00005JMUA|5.0|when i saw it in theators i thought i was going to see a sloppy part two but i was wrong. this part of the movie is so much better then vol 1, i mean it shows more dialague, smart humor, and a good handfull of action. this is really tarintinos holywood worthy oscar winning film that will give him a well deserved credit. the first was a japaneas type movie but this is like a weastern type of film. i saw its a smart swicth. after being gunned down at her wedding, killing evry one in it. the bride wakes up and goes after the poeple who killed her. already crossing of two people on her death list, the bride heads west for her final victoms. bills younger brother budd and her one eyed counter part elle and of course bill. the other reason that this film is so good is that it answers some questions from the first film that brings the entire story together. it shows how the bride becomes so deadly (under the teachings of pei mai) who is one funny old dude. why the bride quit. how elle lost her one eye. why bill shot her down at her wedding. it also shows use the cliffhanger left on vol 1. to make it say it the best it is just one great oscar winning, popcorn munching, instant classic, sewing back together movie that just gives you the main slice of the turkey. just see what is one truly great movie
B000002H6C|5.0|this is the last great metallica cd afterwards producer bob rock wanted to make thier next album black more radio friendly and thus began metallicas sellout for dollars campaign this cd is still the standard for heavy metal in my opinion songs like eye of the beholder and harvester of sorrow simply rock and i dont see how they say the production values wernt good maybe as a guitarist i have a diffrent view of good but to me its the best sounding distortion on any metallica album very heavy yet smooth kirk hammet was using mesa boogies with ada preamps back then these days he trys doing every old song with 1 marshall amp and though it sounds similar its really muddy and lacks projection the guitar solos the lyrics everything about this cd is a masterpiece and makes you sad to realize how great metallica once was stained korn any of todays metal bands dont come close to the complexity and creativity of metallicas old stuff buy this cd today====update apon lookin at my review i noticed how lame i sound saying very heavy yet smooth please forgive my dorkness
B00005JMEW|5.0|i have to say and i mean say this is ONE HELL OF A MOVIE. this tarintino flick really captured a dead aim action show with so many stars and explosive action, its like candy and you just want more. it all starts with a women with no name exept goes by the bride because of how she is dressed who worked for a exclusive organization and she worked for this man bill. then one day she quits, leaves, vamios, and scaddadled. to settle down and start a new life but that dosent happen. gunned down at her wedding and shot in the head she looks dead... but isent. she ends up in a coma and sleeps for four years and when she wakes up she has one thing on her mine...COLD HARD REVEANGE. so she makes a hit list and goes after the people who tried to kill her and kill her friends and husband to be.<br /><br />1. o-ren ishiie<br /><br />2. vernita green<br /><br />3. budd<br /><br />4. elle driver<br /><br />5. BILL<br /><br />now its a kill or be killed mission and the bride will not stand for it. see, this story is so hooking that its like a disease. it has splendid action shots and unique style of filming. all ad all it is another tarintino flick but a whole lot better. see it you wont be dissaponted
B000066NW0|1.0|avril has the worst voice ive ever heard it sounds like britney spears with hiccups and her songs like sk8er boy are just too queer for anybody cool to dig maybe chiks like this but if youre a dude stay far away from this pile of crap  avril is cute and id do her but that doesnt mean she has talent as a musician if this is talent i guess the song balls to the wall is a deep and complex recording
B00068IOWM|5.0|This is one of the best U2 CD's ever.  It has the sound and feel of the classic U2 I know and love.  Having been a fan of U2 since the early 80's who lived through the experimental phase of the band (the dreadful Pop phase), I was in heaven when I first listened to this CD.  It combines the awesome 80's sound with the more recent ATYCLB sound.  I can't help but smile when I hear this music.  I won't go in depth as some people have.  If you are truly a fan of U2, and haven't already done so, BUY THIS CD.  You will not be disappointed!
B000002H33|5.0|this was cliff burtons last album before dying and most agree metallicas best work songs like master of puppets and battery are lightyears beyond the lame 3 bar chords whiney crap called metal today with complex lyrics great guitar work killer drum beats and cliff burtons amazing bass metallica was on top of the world then cliff died and even though they made 1 last great cd justice 4 all it just wasnt the same without cliff any of u young cats who havent bought this cd are missing out on probably the greatest metal album alltime
0385507755|5.0|As a counselor of drug abusing juvenile offenders and other at risk youth, I sometimes use excepts from books as a springboard to stimulate group discussions.  I will certainly be using this book (with some censoring...afterall, profanity is against the rules in our facilities!). Many people can gain insight to the pain of addiction by reading this book.  Thank you, Mr. Frey for sharing. On another note, I have witnessed and believe that twelve step programs can help addicts in their recovery. I also believe that other programs and strategies can work as well.  Mr Frey is a living example. Bottomline: do whatever works and hold on. I will never forget this book.
B0006399FS|1.0|November 23rd, 2004 is a day I'll never forget. My girlfriend was flying into town, we're both big U2 fans, and later on in the evening after a Maggianos dinner, we'd hit the Best Buy and pick up the new cd. I wanted to get it earlier in the day but I promised her I wouldn't. It was a cold and rainy evening in Chicago and finally at around 8:30ish, my girl and I were heading out of the Best Buy parking lot. I was feeling a little bit queezy, with a bottle of Alcohol in me, along with that rich cheezy Lasagna, topped with that pent-up anxiety of being with my girlfriend again after 4 months without her. She was in the drivers seat as I struggled to tear open that darn plastic from the cd cover.  Finally popped it in. And that's exactly where I learned how to dismantle an italian dinner. The cheesy lyrics, the lazy songwriting, and the horribly offensive sound was too much...BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...all over the dashboard and all over my girlfriends new jeans.  She pulled over onto the shoulder and there she too let it go..BLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAA... <br />To make the long story..and fight..short, she's no longer in my life, but more importantly neither is that God-awful cd. I think it's still on the shoulder of the Eisenhower, I just hope no one picked it up and gave it a listen!
B0002TT0NM|3.0|the reason why they made the movies was because the books were so popular. the thing about the books is when you read them you remember everything. that is what I love about the books. this movie, while it was good, you could clearly tell that it was made by a different director. they left out a lot of the things that I loved about this book. the relationship of harry and sirius was cut short in the movie. in the book it was more believable. in the movie he asks him if he would like to come live with him but this is shortly after harry thought the guy killed his parents. it made it a little unbelievable to me. the second film was better than the first and exceeded my expectations so i expected big things from this and in the end was let down. no offense to the director, he makes good films, but he shouldn't have been given this film to direct, he almost ruined a franchise. hopefully chris columbus will come back and do the fourth. he left to spend more time with his family and that is understandable but I like his vision and would like him to see it through.
B00068IOWC|5.0|Because I love reading everything I can get my hands on about the lads from Ireland as well as listening to their music 24/7 I splurged on the SPECIAL LIMITED EDITION: CD ALBUM, DVD & BOOK. 3 days later I'm still not sorry I'm still loving every minute of this album discovering new things in every song with each spin. Adam has never shined so brightly making his presence felt especially in Love and Peace or Else and All Because of You and Vertigo. Sometimes... is still my favorite right now but I'm sure that will change after a few more go 'rounds! There is a lot to digest on this album. A long wait but it was well worth it! My only complaint so far is not including the lyrics with this package! <br />So on to the DVD which was a lot of fun to watch especially how the band came up with Crumbs and the Incredible Edge sharing the story of Vertigo. I hope Bono and Edge sing the Sometimes... (Acoustic Couch Mix) on the tour but they can leave out Vertigo (Temple Bar Mix) which sounds like Bono reading bad poetry in a coffee shop :). <br />If you're not really into reading don't get this edition that comes with the hardback book because Bono's handwriting is kinda hard to make out. The snapshots of the band on the beach and the objects in the studio are cool as are Edge's downloads of how to build a bomb shelter and all the graphics of a real atomic bomb.  <br />Buy this album and enjoy the ride!!!
B0006399FS|5.0|This is un-arguably without a doubt the best material U2 has created since Achtung Baby. While I felt that ATYCLB was a huge sellout for them, they have truly recovered to create their most powerful and complex album in well over a decade. Songs like Vertigo borrow heavily from their 80's sounds of The Unforgettable Fire, and songs like All Because of You that sound straight from Achtung Baby. During a time when album stores are mostly lined with repetetive overplayed pop or rap music, it still comforts me to see U2 still producing albums that show people how music is really done, from the heart, not from the wallet...
B0006399FS|2.0|Near the end of last year Bono had stated that their next cd was nearly completed but delayed the release a year because something was \\"missing\\"  Well, it still holds true.  if you're looking for another Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby you will have to wait another 4 years,  because HTDAAB has more in common with Rattle and Hum and Pop. the songs on HTDAAB remind me of ATYCLB re-treads. Bono's lyrics seem somewhat contrived and his vocals lost in the mix. HTDAATB is a compilation of sounds from previous u2 material. nothing new here; what a shame- have been waiting for another classic from these guys since Achtung Baby.  Still haven't found what i am looking for......
B000002UA2|5.0|Barbet Schroeder has made many films like \\"Murder By Numbers\\", \\"Barfly\\", \\"Kiss of Death\\" and \\"Our Lady of the Assassins\\". This is someone who has been making films for a while.. However there are 2 movies that have been on video in the US that are either very hard to find or out of print, \\"Le Vallee\\" and \\"More\\". Fortunately for Floyd fans as well as fans of late 60s-early 70s movies, \\"La Valle\\" has been out on DVD for the past year. Unfortunately, \\"More\\" hasn't.  <br /> <br />The film itself is good but not great, a slightly dated \\"hippie\\" theme with a violent pig killing scene, a movie about a socialite and some others in search for spiritual fulfillment (or \\"groovy\\" sex depending on how you see the film) but I'm sure the Floyd fans will want to get it as it's under 20 dollars.  It's pretty good, but you can tell it was for the art house crowd.  <br /> <br />I don't think you need to see the movie before you buy the CD, however it doesn't hurt, either. But what I get out of listening to \\"Obscured\\" is that it's definitely an album that Pink Floyd was in a transition during. This was also a time when they were starting to put together \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" at the same time, which they had been doing on the road. Also, they had been filming the \\"Pink Floyd at Pompeii\\" film around this time and had just finished \\"Meddle\\". I also think that they had been involved in an opera. So their hands were very full at this period in their career. And it's a big reason why this album in particular gets lost, yet has a lot of great moments of where they were coming from, and where they were going. I also think that you get more of their playing out of this one than others.   <br /> <br />1.Obscured By Clouds- Gilmour's lead guitar with some electronic sounding drums.  <br />2.When You're In - More guitar with some more keyboards, kind of a continuation of the first song. Kind of reminds me of some of the stuff they did for \\"Zabriskie Point\\".  <br />3.Burning Bridges -David Gilmour and Rick Wright singing on this one. Kind of sounds like \\"Breathe\\" a little, the slow style PF is famous for.   <br />4. The Gold It's In The... Acid-rock sounding. Not the typical Floyd song, more typical of rock music in the era though. Sounds like they were having fun.   <br />5. Wots...Uh The Deal - Another one that indicates the transition of the time, sounds like something that would've been on \\"Meddle\\", one of the highlights of the album.  <br />6. Mudmen -instrumental of \\"Burning Bridges\\".  <br />7. Childhood's End - Definitely one that shows what was to be. They did this one in concert a few times in the early 70s, and is also another highlight of the album. My opinion is this should've been on \\"Echoes\\". Classic Gilmour.  <br />8. Free Four - Roger Waters sings here. As this was a period that Roger had yet to be the leader/songwriter of Pink Floyd, your hear him starting to get his footing in this song. But the lyrics are definitely a taste of what would come with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" right to \\"The Final Cut\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Life is a short, warm moment <br />And death is a long cold rest\\" <br />\\"You are the angel of death <br />And I am the dead man's son. <br />And he died like a mole in a fox hole. <br />And everyone is still in the run.\\" <br />\\"You suffle in gloom in the sickroom <br />And talk to yourself till you die.\\" <br />  <br />9. Stay - Would've been perfect on \\"Meddle\\". Rick Wright and David Gilmour sing on this one, but also has some \\"Dark Side\\" elements on it. Another favorite.    <br /> <br />10. Absolutely Curtains - This one sounds more like a \\"Saucerful\\" era song.  <br /> <br />This album is an essential because A: more than \\"Meddle\\", \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" is an album where you can hear the band going through changes where you can hear the direction they are going in. B: You hear what makes each member of Pink Floyd an essential member and that there was a time when Rick Wright was definitely as important as Roger and Dave as a singer and songwriter (no offense to Nick but he didn't sing much), and a time when Roger was not considered THE force behind Pink Floyd as he would be considered as later, however you do hear him getting his voice with this album. C: The songs themselves are really good and not \\"throwaways\\".   <br /> <br />
B000069CWE|2.0|You may disagree with Linkin Park ever doing rap music but they just released a new album with Jay-Z so it's possible. Reanimation was too hard to follow and the music was really weird. I was really confused when I first listened to it but when I understood it I found I still didn't like it. They also really messed up the lyrics it was a complete mess. I know some people realy enjoyed this album and I can see how people would like it but it just didn't do it for me. I like Linkin Park when they're playing good rock music instead of techno or rap and if you want this album download the songs or borrow a copy of it because you really either like it or you don't.
B0000009SY|5.0|If you've stumbled across this review and haven't listened to Frank's music, the best place to start is the \\"Strictly Commercial\\" and \\"Have I Offended Somebody\\" compilations as well as picking up \\"The Real Frank Zappa\\" book to get an idea of who this brilliant musician and satirist is for starters.   <br /> <br />His music doesn't make for \\"easy listening\\" and can be really confusing. When you see the film \\"200 Motels\\" you find it really difficult to believe that he WASN'T involved with drugs. The Zappa estate has continued to put CDs out of unreleased performances, the vaults of which must be staggering. \\"Joe's Garage\\" is probably one of his more \\"accessible\\" albums, although I think \\"Overnight Sensation\\", \\"Sheik Yerboudi\\" and \\"Apostrophe\\" are by far the most  \\"commercial\\". \\"Joe's\\" is much more challenging. I would recommend this one for the \\"intermediate\\" fan and would also recommend picking up \\"Lather\\"(\\"A Little Green Rosetta\\" is also on there) before hearing this one.   <br /> <br />Zappa put the \\"concept album\\" concept to good use, and to put it simply, \\"Joe's Garage\\" reflected Frank's disdain of the music industry at that time and the growing censorship that he saw looming on the horizon. Obviously with titles like \\"Crew Slut\\" and \\"Why Does it Hurt When I Pee\\" (and some of the songs like \\"Catholic Girls\\") if you have kids you might want to listen to this one when they're not around.  <br /> <br />I do think that this one is a tougher listen than his mid-70s era songs, but it maintains Zappa's twisted humor, satire, and  <br />the times he shuts up n' plays his guitar.  <br /> <br />With the FCC fines and the monopolization of radio stations in recent years, as well as difficult times for good musicians who don't play by the rules (Zappa always tried to do things without compromise, the time he did resulted in the Warner Brothers albums he did before \\"Joe's\\"), this is a far more realistic vision than I'm sure even Zappa would have thought it would be.  <br /> <br />My opinion is that it's one of his best albums, but it's also one of the ones that's more challenging to the listener. You might want to go with \\"Sheik Yerbouti\\" if this one winds up being too much for you... Like in the \\"Matrix\\", you can take that one pill that keeps you complacent (and just listen to the current crop of music) or you can take that other one and see what happens. Because once you go into Zappa's world, you'll never be the same.  <br /> <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|The only reason this isn't my favorite Metallica album is because Master of Puppets is just a little bit better. I think the song quality on Ride the Lighting really proves how powerful good metal can be. For Whom The Bell Tolls is one of my favorite songs of all time and is one of the best on this album. I really enjoyed Ride the Lighting the song itself my favorite part of it is the begining and I thought that Fade to Black was very underrated considering what a good song it is. Metallica has shown the world how great they can be and how bad they can be but with Ride the Lighting they show why they are considered one of the greatest bands of all time. If you don't have this album I would highly recommend you go out and buy it because you won't regret it.
B00006G8G1|5.0|I can't believe some of these reviews about the editing.  Oh poor little baby the camera changes to much, god how old are you people.  I didn't even notice the editing until i read these reviews.  Anyways about the dvd everything is awsome.  As always Maiden is in top form playing every one of their songs to perfection, just amazing. Get it, now.
B00002E23E|5.0|Though the 2003 Led Zeppelin DVD set might even be a bit better than TSRTS musically, this is still the Zeppelin DVD with the best picture quality. All performances were filmed on 35mm film, not on video tapes or 16mm film. That's why TSRTS DVD has the most stunning footage of Led Zeppelin that you can get. The weird \\"fantasy\\"! sequences are excusable IMO, since the musical performances are all very good. I would rate the performances on this DVD as follows: <br /> <br />Rock & Roll 9/10 <br />Black Dog (sadly cut) 9/10 <br />Since I've been loving you (10/10) <br />No Quarter (10/10) <br />The song remains the same (10/10) <br />The rain song (10/10) <br />Dazed and Confused (9/10) <br />Moby Dick (8/10) <br />Stairway to Heaven (10/10) <br />Heartbreaker (only snippets, too short to rate) <br />Whole Lotta Love (10/10) <br /> <br />Robert Plant's singing is very good (in particular in TSRTS, Rain Song and Stairway to Heaven), Jimmy Page is in top form and Jones/Bonham are flawless as usual. <br /> <br />Killer versions of The Song Remains The Same and Stairway to Heaven!!! Maybe the best Stairway guitar solo ever! <br /> <br />All in all: highly recommended!
B00005JMAH|5.0|Shrunken Talking head. <br />This film is great, fun to watch, and totally atmospheric. <br />The most stupid extra on the DVD is the Interviews done with some moron and the Shrunken head; special case in point is when Gary Oldman is in the same interview as the new guy playing Dumbledore, and the questions can only be classified as inane. <br />Anyways, the film by itself is great, but I think the extras should be rethought so that the end product is at least thoughtful, and somewhat more worth an indepth look than the trash like the shrunken mind, err  head, interview. <br />Nice to notice that Lenny Henry and Dawn French are in the same movie.
B000003T9B|5.0|The album that started it all. Overkill launched themselves in the mid 1980's with this thrash metal classic. Not only does this album shred in every way possible but, at the time it was refreshing as hell. OVERKILL seemed to have their own, identifyable sound. During the time when bands like SLAYER, METALLICA and ANTHRAX were launching themselves as well. OVERKILL were just as good as any of those bands, if not better. They appeared influenced by no one. You could here the sincerity in their sound, pure thrash with a singer that had some serious range. The instruments all complimented each other and created a sound that became all their own. The CD is among their best and serves as the launching pad for a band that would continue on for 20 years. Get this CD, it is pure melodic thrash!
B0000VD04M|5.0|Now that independent film has taken over, and studios are more willing to back them, I think Ed Wood was around at the wrong time. Or was he? Who cares? His simplicity is so endearing, as projected by Johnny Depp (one of our more unappreciated actors). I find that I put on \\"Plan 9\\" or \\"Bride of the Monster\\" for sheer entertainment more than most others. Tim Burton's very loving tribute to the misunderstood Ed becomes a loving dislay of hope, courage and confidence. Anyone who wants a dream may find it; maybe Tim's film is a guideline. This came out the same year as \\"Forrest Gump\\", which seemed to take over the Oscars, but this film has the distinction of winning 100% of it's nominations: only 2, the wonderful make-up, and Martin Landau's exceptional performance as Bela Lugosi. Depp is so much fun; Sarah Jessica Parker belies her later success (\\"Sex & the City\\") as the prudish wife.Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones are customarily hammy, which is appropriate for the characters. Especially great is a small cameo from Vincent d'Onofrio as Orson Welles, Ed's all-time idol. This film is nothing but fun, and the black and white photography is totally appropriate. Lovers of Ed will appreciate this for what it is; Ed's been given a bad rap. Tim Burton's wonderful film will dispell that myth.
B0002858YS|3.0|This was a great album just to play at parties or hanging out with a large group of drinking buddies - but I tried to listen to it on my own a few times and it felt too spectacular to just enjoy. I wish I could have connected with it on a personal level, but it's quite shallow. I think it was intended to be a party record, obviously, but I was left wishing it was more than just a brief hot fuss. <br /> <br />But it's brilliant if you like to have fun and just play something loud at a party.
B000002U82|5.0|This album is an absolute must-have for any Pink Floyd fan, any rock fan, any music fan in general. The CD contains some of the greatest rock songs in history, and I'll never grow tired of it.<br /><br />Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix... what do these three have in common? They're all icons.<br /><br />But Pink Floyd stands out.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|The above title was taken from a revire I read somewhere in the Web, and I think it says it all. This movie is boring. It begins with a good premise, then everything goes down. And it's not funny at all. I don't know how it was advertised as a comedy. It's almost a total drama, with romantic obvious ending.<br /><br />The performances by everyone involved are great, and I was sorry that Paul Michael Glaser and Francis McDormand had so few time on screen. Keanu Reeves proved that there's life after his disastrous performances in both sequences of MATRIX (script's fault, not his, and Amanda Peet in very likeable as Keaton's daughter.
0609610570|3.0|Execution is basically two books: The Building Blocks of Execution and The Processes of Execution. <br /> <br />The Building Blocks were intriguing. Stimulated a lot of discussion. One hundred forty-or-so pages worth reading. 4 stars. <br /> <br />The Processes filled the usual 265 page contract. Painful. 2 stars. <br /> <br />Business readers will save time and (possibly) buy more books when publishers stop paying by the pound.
B000002UYZ|5.0|This is one of the biggest albums ever made. I am not a huge Beatles fan, I prefer Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons. But I must admit these guys were geniuses and their music put the base of what most people listen to nowadays. Simple and plain. That kid who recommended getting the Backstreet Boys instead, oh my God!!! I'll give him/her a recommendation back, go get Barney's music and videos instead of Backstreet Boys stuff. At least Barney looks less gay.
B00005JNS5|5.0|this movie was way ahead of its time, to cultures meeting, understanding each others ways and behaviors.  how one's view honor and obligations in two different worlds. then add romance and you still dont get a clear picture of this magnetude. when you watch this film you just appreciate's its honesty, loyalties, and respect and mixed with action. to put simply a great film, which they don't make ANY MORE!!!!!!!!!
B00007AJF8|1.0|Sometimes a movie comes along which everyone cracks up as a masterpiece, nominates for Oscars and all that, when actually it's terrible. \\"Being There\\" was one of those. This is another. It's pointless and silly without being funny. Actually, it's rather painful. You sit watching it wondering what idiocy is coming next. It's slow, and really rather boring. There is absolutely, totally, utterly no point in having half the film set in an office with a shoulder-high ceiling. I was willing to laugh, or even smile, but after about ten minutes I couldn't. Contrast this mess with \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\", a genuinely witty, touching and ingenious film, although founded on a similarly wacky premise. Oh dear Oh dear Oh dear. What might Woody Allen have made of this basic material?
B00005JL3A|5.0|All the action in this movie is insane. It's awesome when The Militiant Group is kicking the zombies' asses. Milla Jovovich is one tough cookie against the zombies and knows all their weaknesses and Michelle Rodriguez did a great job playing her part even though the role was not as big as it should have been. This movie is a great way to be entertained for a couple of hours!
B000092Q4U|4.0|Many words have been used to describe this album, with \\"devastating\\" being the most appropriate I've heard so far.  The music attacks the listener from the start, dragging you through track after track of adrenalizing power and intensity.  The overall tone is incredible, with some of the most striking moments occurring in the hard-stop pauses where you are treated to a fraction of a second of silence before the music kicks in again.  It's hard to give examples of other bands similar to this one, as they combine many different elements to form a style all their own.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this album to anybody who likes thrash or death metal, and can handle aggressive, death-style vocals.  If you're looking for tuneful, melodic singing, look somewhere else.  A note to those giving one-star reviews while trashing the vocals: this music isn't meant to be immediately accessible to everybody out there.  Most fans would probably admit that death vocals were an acquired taste, and it was the insane drums and rhythm guitar work that initially kept them coming back for more until they came to appreciate the vocals as well.  The album deserves to be viewed as a whole rather than dismissed because the vocal style is objectionable to some.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Johnny Depp doesn't get as much credit as he should. He is one of the most versatile actors and shows it here again as George Jung, the drug dealer who becomes a cocaine kingpin in The 1970s. Jordi Molla was great as Diego Delgado, Penelope Cruz was great as Mirtha, and Ray Liotta was great as George's father. A captivating movie about the life of George Jung. Very, very well done!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|What are some of you other reviewers talking about as for the reviewer who said this 2 disc extended cut is the same as the original cut,what are you thinking!You obviosly dont.Or you have never seen the original cut and just thought it would be cool to write a review.Im sorry i cant stand people who review like that,there are people out there trying to get a good feel about the movie before they drop $25 dollars on it,but some moron is going to tell you something completely untrue,oh! and he gives it like one star so it totally messes up the star rating,which is the first thing people usally look at,for some it may be the only thing.In fact there is 12 minutes of entirely new footage and like 15 min. of footage that has been redone this makes the movie from 4 to five stars it feels in all the gaps and plot which may have left some people guessing about certain things in the movie after watching the original release,this is a whole new movie and it is great.You could describe the action somewhat like the first Blade movie,but Underworld is for sure more serious about its content,its darker,and it really tries to show the grit of vampire and werewolves as where Blade is more comic book stile(dont get me wrong i love blade they are just two diffrent movies in the same genre and genrally about the same content)Underworld is just more well,freaky is a word i'll use.No need for me to tell you the plot theres plenty of reviews here for that,but one thing is for sure if you have a home theatre system this movie thumps hard,from the gunfire to the growling its great.And so is the picture quality it really works great with the dark lighting and feel to the movie.My one complaint is i see they have now put this movie on superbit well sort of they put the original release on superbit and did nothing for the extented release whats up with that if you buy this movie you have to but the extended version,come on columbia dont leave us hanging.Anyway if you enjoyed any of the following movies you MUST see this as it IS better than somme listed here... <br />Blade 1&2,Matrix(its better than the two sequels),Van Hellsing, <br />x-men,and similar movies you get the picture you dont have to be just an action fan to enjoy this there is some horror elenents to this one,Without a doubt watch this movie!
B00005JKED|5.0|This is a powerful movie. Denzel does it again. This time as Officer Alonzo Harris. He deserved that Oscar and it shows a gangster movie can get Oscar love too. This movie should have won two Oscars because Ethan Hawke did an equally impressive job playing Alonzo's partner 'Jake Hoight'. When will Jack Valente ever learn? As for the other performances, Scott Glenn did a great job as 'Roger', Snoop did a great job as a former drug dealer, Dr. Dre did a great job as 'Paul', one of the cops that works for Alonzo, and despite the small role, Eva Mendes did a great job as Alonzo's wife, Sara. Alonzo is an aggressive cop with a corrupt side to him and the only one man enough to bring him down is Jake. There are twists and turns in this movie and that coupled with Denzel Washington starring in this movie make this movie worth to watch!
B0000013G9|5.0|Hi,this album upon which I purchased when it first came out.  I Just Love This CD.  In fact I treasure all their music.  It was so ahead of it time.  We were introduce to the Young Ladies  and saw how they develop not only through their personal lives their music was so controversial but so poignant.  The producers, writer and TLC had a clear vision when they put their music together it was their stories or the stories they were telling.  Allot of conviction went into they music.  This is a Classic Albm another Exceptional not dated Release of music.   I love the songs for one reason or another.  My personal favorites that I can play, play and play again are the folloing: <br /> 2. Creep <br /> 3. CrazySexyCool - Interlude  Listen      <br />7. Red Light Special  Listen      <br />8. Waterfalls  Listen      <br />9. Intermission-lude        <br />10. Let's Do It Again        <br />11. If I Was Your Girlfriend        <br />12. Sexy - Interlude        <br />13. Take Our Time        <br />14. Can I Get A Witness-Interlude        <br />15. Switch        <br />16. Sumthin' Wicked This Way <br /> <br />These ladies had a message through out their album and touched so many people Teen, 20 somethings, 30 something, 40 and up.  Sure where their songs that are probably geared to someone very you in teen age or 20's but clearly you could feel and touch their lyrics and 3 ladies work as a team.  We're their challenges and growing pains within the group. Yes. they were never afraid to be real with themselves and their fans.  No Destiny Child can touch this legacy.  These Girls ARe Simply One of the Best Female Groups. <br />I look forward to their return on their terms of course.  Losing Left Eye is major Void.  Such a Spirtual, Talented, Thought-provoking person.  She is truly irreplaceable.  God Bless TLC. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|This is U2's defining moment. This album is like a great antique. With HTDAAB, they have simply redefined sound. U2 is in new territory. This album is an experience. It feels like you're there. The music and the lyrics weave in and out of your soul. This album is definitely a grand accomplishment. People saying that it's too safe should check the nature of their argument. Can't be too safe with all these irrational 1-star reviews. All the mixed reviews are evidence that they did do something truly special. Sometimes it takes a little time to appreciate it. This recording will emotionally take you to another level. It has a real texture to it. People keep talking about all of their Grammys. Come 2006, don't be surprised when this gets nominated for Album of the Year. And God help all of the haters if it wins.  Tell me who's going to release a better album between now and September 30, 2005? No one!!! With this album, they have all but secured legendary status. I'm 30 years old, and this is brilliant. I have a lot of the stuff that's currently being played on MTV, but I know genius when I hear it. \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is genius.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Hello guys and customers! <br /> <br />I'm a German girl, 35 years old and I was so glad that the Gilmore Girls started to show in April over here in Germany. They broadcasted the first three seasons and I just thought \\"WOW\\". This show is so much fun, wit, charm and love - you have to watch it! Because I am a fan of the English language and like more the original voices than the synchronized dialogues, I bought the first season on DVD and I was so happy to be able to watch and understand it that I pre-ordered the second season as soon as it was possible.  <br />I love how the actors play their roles. They seem to be so deep in their roles that you sometimes don't know if they are playing or if they really ARE the persons. It is so real, so wonderfully played, and I love Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson and the young Alexis Bledel, because they do their job with heart and soul. Of course every other actor on this show is great as well. <br />Go and watch this show - it is terrific!!!
B0000039PW|5.0|The Source only gave this classic album 4.5/5 mics. which many might say \\"It was a debut\\", but nas had his debut \\"Illmatic\\" get 5 mics. What were the Source smokin' when they were reviewing \\"Ready To Die\\". <br /> <br />\\"Ready To Die\\" is way better than \\"Illmatic\\" the lyrics are on the same level as each other but the beats in \\"Ready To Die\\" are light years ahead than in \\"Illmatic\\". <br /> <br />Back to the review:  <br /> <br />1. Intro : 4/5 <br />2. Things Done Changed : 5/5 <br />3. Gimme The Loot : 5(should get more than 5 though)/5 <br />4. Machine Gun Funk : 4/5 <br />5. Warning : 5/5 <br />6.

B000059TPI|5.0|To me, HARVEY is the greatest of the so-called \\"screwball comedies\\". Like other examples of the genre, HARVEY revolves around a harmless bumbler whom society considers a lunatic (Elwood P. Dowd); at movie's end, we are left with the impression that all mankind are mad and those in the sanitarium are no more lunatic than those outside. But unlike other screwball farces, HARVEY has as much heart and thoughtfulness as hilarity. If ARSENIC AND OLD LACE sends you into hysterics every time you see it, HARVEY will unfailingly induce a warm smile. Jimmy Stewart seemed at first an odd choice for the role of an amiable drunk (the role was turned down by Jack Benny and Bing Crosby before Stewart got it); but he plays the part superbly, winning our hearts as well as giving a subtle, naturalistic performance. His monologue in the alley behind the bar (when he explains his way of life and how he met Harvey) is a classic of Stewart's career and a scene I never tire of watching. So do yourself a favor and welcome HARVEY into your home.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I recieved this for christmas from a Brother who had been telling me about this series for the past months. Within minutes of starting the First disc i was hooked onto it and was growing attached to the charectors. The fact that it had Views from the actual soilders before each episode excited me even more and i still watch each episode with joy to this very day! <br />Also the Bonus's are great and the action of each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat!

0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice is a beautifully written love story, full of humor and life-like imagery. The characters Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are both carved out nicely, with Austen's acute sense about how both men and women think and perceive beauty, love, society. The novel is a compelling read, and for diehard romantics like me, it is irresistable to the end. While Sense and Sensibility moves more slowly, and likewise also dwells on stories of two sisters, there the love stories are presented with maze of other matter. Here the hero must overcome his pride, the heroine must fight a battle with her prejudices, and both then discover not only love in each other but their real selves. Additional stories and people appear perfectly developed in their own roles of lovers, parents, friends, envious relations, grumpy grandmothers, lively teenagers, etc. The drama of a great movie or a soap opera is all here, with Austen's simple and elegant story telling.<br /><br />Many sequences and sentences are purely delightful or extermely hilarious, making the novel one of those reads where you are caught laughing aloud or smiling with twinkle your eyes alone, as you are relishing the new turn of events. While the story is set in Victorian era, the characters, emotions and humor is timeless. The novel is an easy read, fit for travel reading as well as for fun, and trust me, the romantic in you will be raving about it for a long time! In fact, two movies compelled me to reread the novel recently: Gurinder Chadda's Bride and Prejudice that reinvents the classic in a Bollywood flavor and Tom Hanks- Meg Ryan Starrer You've got mail. In You've Got Mail there are repeated references to the novel, and to the extent the opposites attract, and essential elements of novel are concerned, the movie is like a reincarnated version of the novel.<br /><br />Citation from You've Got Mail<br /><br />  Confession: I have read Pride and Prejudice about 200 times. I get lost in the language-words like thither, mischance, felicity. I'm always in agony over whether Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are really going to get together. Read it - I know you'll love it.<br /><br />Meg Ryan's character, to her anonymous email friend, Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail.<br /><br />(the reference to the movie is for those who have seen and like the movie, else the novel is intrinsically enjoyable, and even for those who have seen this movie or the movie based on the novel, worth spending a fun-filled reading time with.)like thither, mischance, felicity.

B00005JKCH|3.0|Although I was impressed by the film in terms of story and the way it evolved, I got very annoyed at how he whined about his obligation to his new power.....his uncle's reminder about his responsibility........He mooned about MJ before he was bitten and loved her since they were how old? and now she confesses her love for him and he says \\"no thanks, just a friend is all I will ever be\\".........apparently he has no trust in her...I mean to share his big responsibility....his obligation to mankind.....I hope the second one is a bit more believable in terms of his relationship with other people....And by the way, when he finally finishes off the Dafoe character, I would have left him the way he fell than do him the favor of protecting his son from finding out what a jerk his father was.
0743243307|4.0|<br />I got through maybe half of the book and put it down for a week. I thought it might not apply to me, that maybe I was too different or too far from that culture for it to feel relevant. <br /> <br />In that week, I realized that she was struggling with almost exactly the same questions I was. She was coming to the same unacceptable, or desireable, answers. And she was getting there by a completely different route. <br /> <br />I started reading it again. <br /> <br />I keep thinking about it even though I finished it a month ago. Perhaps it's a slow-acting book. At least it's working that way on me. Every now and then I get a glimmer of the wisdom that's there. <br /> <br />It's a good book. It's well written. I suppose I'm disappointed because what I'm seeing in it isn't magical, cure-all wisdom. It's the wisdom that people gain and use, almost only when it's not easy.
B0002XDODU|4.0|This album is a little different from the rest. I first saw the Mein Teil video on german MTV and it made me think this album was going to be quite good, I was right. I only had a few things to differ with. I won't say much about lyrics considering there's many Rammstein listers don't speak german. Well, here's my track ratings 1-10. <br /> <br />Reise, Reise: (9.5) - This is a nice song with the use of a harmonica. Very pleasant. <br /> <br />Mein Teil: (10) - Now, this song is a masterpiece. The video is pretty wicked too. Out of all the songs this is probably the best single material. <br /> <br />Dalai Lama: (10) - Another brilliant song. I'm just in love with the melody, it's truly musical ingenious. <br /> <br />Keine Lust: (8.8) - A well put together song that plays out swell. <br /> <br />Los: (9) - A different song in a great way. Including the harmonica once again, nice. <br /> <br />Amerika: (10) - Here's where things may go sour for some people. It's pretty obvious this is \\"not a love song\\". I'm not exactly sure what to say about it though. Rammstein has a pretty large fan-base in America and this might detour people. Other than all that it's musically one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />Moskau: (?) - I might be alone here but I just never really got into this song. It's a little different from the others. I didn't rate it because it wouldn't be proper. <br /> <br />Morgenstern: (8.5) - Prominent in drums/keyboarding. It's a pretty upbeat song. <br /> <br />Stein um Stein: (8.8) - This song mixes great with all the instruments used. It has a pleasing background melody that's used nicely. <br /> <br />Ohne Dich: (8) - This one's a slower based song that'll probably depend on the listener. I like it though. <br /> <br />Amour (8.8) - This is a nifty closer that's well composed. <br /> <br />Well that about raps up my review. It's pretty hard to rate some of these over others but I tried. I hope this helps a few people.
0790729393|3.0|I'm not going to go into the details of this movie much. From reading the reviews on this site, you either like it, or you don't. Frankly, I very seldom like any movie made in the last 20 years or so...but this one really grabbed me and kept my attention. All of the actors came across as very believable characters...something sorely lacking in most movies. The boys, especially, played their parts wonderfully. <br /> <br />The transfer of the film was great...clear, with little grain or other problems. About my only complaint in this area would be the inconsistent sound level. Some sound effects, such as the screaming subway train, would be speaker-rattling with the volume at the proper level for the dialogue. <br /> <br />The worst problem with this DVD, however, is the fact that it is a \\"flipper\\". For a movie of only 2-1/2 hours, this is inexcusable. Not only that, the transitions for the end of one side and the beginning of the other are extremely abrupt. Though I can't remember from seeing the movie in the theatre, it certainly appears something was truncated. <br /> <br />4 stars for the movie, 4 for the transfer, 1 for the DVD.
B00000JCY0|4.0|I first owned this album on 8-track when I was a kid. Now I have all the songs here on different releases, although I still have the 8-track I can't play it because I don't have an 8-track player! Made up of many songs from the killer \\"Desolation BLVD.\\" the album cooks differently with a few nice additions. \\"Rebel Rouser\\" is a re-working of \\"Hellraiser\\" and still kicks major [...]. \\"Heartbreak Today\\" and \\"restless\\" are more pure Sweet tracks that is made up of their signature sound of blusey riffs and staggeringly high harmonies. The killer blusey tag at the end of \\"Heartbreak..\\" is soo cool. \\"Peppermint Twist\\" is seemingly an ode to the band's pop past but delivered with a punch in the face instead of a slap on the [...] and is still cool in my book. And my book is a foot thick and printed on solid gold pages, mister. My 8-track did not include the bonus tracks of \\"Burn on the flame\\" and \\"Own up..\\" but \\"Burn on...\\" is one of the band's best, \\"Own up...\\" sounds a bit like some kind of high school educational film preachy song. Overall the album is more than a worthy addition to any collectors 70s rock collection. I know it's in mine.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" allows the audience to experience the mental hell that is schizophrenia.  This is accomplished by the sure-handed direction of Ron Howard, the clever screenplay of Akiva Goldsman, and as mathemitician John Nash, the on-target performance of Russell Crowe.  Mental illness is difficult to portray on film.  Rarely is it done properly and usually it results in either over-the-top portrayals or in highly mannered performances.  Crowe manages to portay it with the minimum of mannerisms.  To Crowe's credit, Nash is not an entirely sympathetic character here.  There are also clever devises employed by Howard and Goldsman to portray schizophrenia that I will not reveal here that are quite effective.  \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" also has an excellent ensemble cast.  Jennifer Connelly is compelling as Nash's sympathetic wife, Alicia.  Paul Bettany and Ed Harris do good work as a pair of Nash's friends.  Solid support is also supplied by Josh Lucas and Adam Goldberg as Nash's colleagues as does Christopher Plummer as Nash's psychiatrist.
B0006399FS|4.0|For u2 this is a good but not great album.  They are one of the greatest bands ever to exist.  So for U2 standards, it gets 3 Stars. <br /> <br />Compared to mostly everything else out there, this is a classic album.  So for music standards, it gets 5 stars.
B00005U122|5.0|Very intelligent track order as well as selection (you get all the jewels with one exception of Us and Them). Very intelligent, relaxed filming that allows you to feel like you are there rather than watching another fast-cuts nonsense. Very intelligent stage decor.Your perfect gig. Roger Waters.
B0006399FS|5.0|Long time fan.  This album is their best since Achtung and may even be as good as Joshua Tree with enough listens.  Buy, buy, buy!
B000002IM7|4.0|In 1988 Kings X release one of the finest debut albums in rock and roll's brief history. OUt of the Silent Planet went where no 80's metal band dared to tread. Drawing upon the coolest styles rock had to offer (Hendrix, the Beatles, the Beach Boys) Kings X offered up a plethora of diverse tracks that made it hard to pigeon-hole the band into one type of genre. From the opening track \\"In the New Age\\" with its spaced out arrangements and soulful vocals to the next track \\"Goldilox\\" with its beautiful melody and tasteful guitar work the band plows through 8 more songs , each one unusual and totally original, even with its obvious roots. The album carries a totally positive vibe with lyrics easily digestable and plenty on bone crushing guitar work by Ty Tabor. A trio, Kings X still give wonderful harmonies Brian Wilson would be proud of and melodies that even Lennon/McCartney would be proud of as well. It's a wonder that this band didn't explode on the scene, but in retrospect it's a good thing because it allowed the band to produce several more enchanting efforts without the pressures of big-time stardom. Check this out, please.
078322804X|5.0|Your first reaction to this film is to recoil at the destruction.  You think, how much more damage can be done?  Then director John Landis tops himself in the succeeding scenes.  Unlike the film \\"1941\\" where the destruction was just pointless, there is a certain poetry to the chaos on display here.  Not lost among the ruins are crackerjack production numbers by immortal r'n'b performers (Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway).  Landis does not just give lip service to these performers he gives them an elaborate stage to show their stuff.  I was a teenager when I first saw this film and it spurred my interest in this music.  Even the Sam and Dave cassette tape that the brothers play in their car piqued my interest.  John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd are deliciously low-key as the brothers.  Alot of good cameos in this film.  Just tighten your seatbelts and enjoy the fun.
B00006AW2J|5.0|\\"Beggar's Banquet\\".  Ahh, this is the roots.  Growing up, my dad owned a copy of Beggar's Banquet on vinyl.  A really old copy, all white cover, one of the first released.  We still have it and I play it often.  I think this album is one of the most classic examples of the Stones' ability as a band.  Its slick bluesy rhythms and steel guitar bleed through the stereo system  and Mick Jagger's down-south wail reminds you why he's known as the greatest performer on Earth.  This album is packed with some of the Stones' most memorable croons, such as Sypathy for the Devil, No Expectations, Street Fighting Man, and Parachute Woman, (my personal favorite).       No band has ever captured the transition of rock and blues and blended them so well together as the Stones do in their recordings.  \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" is one of the most memorable records of my childhood and I highly recommend it. However, \\"Exile on Main St.\\" really kicks it too, and it's a double record.
068987474X|3.0|Out of the thousand Christian books I buy a month,this secular book struck my attention. Yeah, this book does tell the truth in some scenarios. But alot of the advice isn't a path I would walk.<br /><br />I like the sarcasism within both the authors. I couldn't stop laughing.
B0006399FS|5.0|I've listened three or four times through.  The word is: ENERGY.  Described any other way is fine, but these gentlemen still rock the house, and they still do it with emotion and greatness. <br /> <br />Bono may rule this house they've built, but Edge is the architect.  And Larry and Adam are the curators, making sure the two Kings don't make mistakes, and sometimes correcting them. <br /> <br />This record, like any great u2 offering, is personal, grande, intimate, and worldly.  No apologies; and why should there  be?  This is honesty.  This is U2. <br /> <br />As for the doubters and complainers?   Screw. <br />The rest of us, well you know, ITS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

B00003CXPD|5.0|This film is a real winner.  Set against the backdrop of the coalminer's strike of the late 1980's in Northern England, the film is about an adolescent boy(Jamie Bell) who wants to pursue ballet instead of more manly pursuits such as boxing despite the social and economic pressures that are against such a dream.  Jamie Bell is just luminous as Billy.  You can feel the fire that burns inside him as he pursues this dream.  My favorite scene in the film is one where he dances his frustrations out of anger with the Jam's \\"A Town Called Malice\\" playing on the soundtrack.  Good support is offered here by Gary Lewis as Billy's father, a widower who has the burden of raising his family and also towing the union line in the miner's strike.  Julie Walters is equally fine as Billy's sympathetic ballet teacher.  What I did like about the film is that it effectively portrayed it's sympathies for the striking miners without going over-the-top.  There was a film called \\"Brassed Off\\" that was released a few years earlier that I thought was too heavy-handed in it's politics to be effective.  On a final note, I love the use of T-Rex music on the soundtrack.
0790729369|5.0|For nine years I have heard this:\\"It wasn't as good as the book!\\"I am so sorry that for those nine years I allowed other people's opinion to keep me from seeing this marvelous movie.I was captivated from the instant the film started and I leaned forward hanging onto every last smoldering word and action from Streep and Eastwood(an actor heretofore I have never enjoyed).This is a powerful, bittersweet story that touched my very innermost soul,especially since I have experienced,fortunately, a most satisfying and intense love that I chose,considering all of the ramifications,to be necessary for my life.I have been both Francesca and Richard and totally understood the dilemma of both characters.Streep and Eastwood did it for me!They delivered what the screenplay dictated and then some!So much was said by their long silent stares and the stillness of each aching moment.Whatever the book may have added,I certainly didn't miss it!This movie said enough to me for a lifetime.
B000002C2E|3.0|Is it just me, or does Dylan sound precisely as if he is singing with a frog in his throat? Maybe it is supposed to sound that way, but when I popped in the CD and heard the first song I was adequately frightened. The simple but ominous blues riff that comprises the melody was enough to tell me that Bob has changed. But I guess those cigarettes are catching up with him. Oh well, I am not even sure when this album was released. Anyway, the music is most unusual, but if you have only heard \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", etc., you are going to be in for a surprise!
B00005JMXX|3.0|the special affects and all that computerized crap was honestly GOOD...although the main drawback from this film is how OVERDONE it trully is. sure i liked it in all for the \\"suspense\\" it gave u AT TIMES however really this couldve been made from a more realistic point of view and not some OUT OF THIS WORLD director point of view..even actual climatologists were offended by the film..well you can't blame them...
1576751988|5.0|It is a great book instead of a less than palatable title, but it totally agrees with the basic premise of the book, which is that Eating a frog is a metaphor that means doing the most important thing that matters most first thing in the morning. This is the task you are most likely to put off, it being most likely UNPLEASANT, but also probably the one that will have the greatest possible impact on your life. <br /> <br />The book makes the premise ( which I wholeheartedly agree) that there is never time to do everything on your to do list, and there will never be.   Thus, instead of reading so many books on how to organize your life, and try to do the yeoman's job of chasing the completion of all tasks, you have to accept the fact that if you cannot get everything done, you might as well focus on the most important task first.  <br /> <br />This goes back to the 80:20 rule, which is that the most important top 20 percent of all your task will most likely determine 80 percent of your success, and instead of ticking it off one by one ( most people do their task list in list order, or worst, do the easiest always first), there is a good basis to believe you can be more success just focusing on these top 20 percent. <br /> <br />Brian Tracy focuses on three vital rules of effective personal time management: decision, discipline and determination.   The book presents 21 ways to do this.  It is a short, practical book of only 144 pages, but nevertheless presents much more substance than many books thicker in size. <br /> <br />Wilson Ng <br />visit my weblog at [...] <br />
B00005JMEW|1.0|Honestly after seeing this movie I wanted to kill Bill and the rest of the cast, basically everyone involved in creating this movie. I felt like I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this. The martial arts sequences are unrealistic. As much as I like Uma Thurman and David Carradine they could not bring the movie to a decent watchable standard. As much as I, being a woman, like the idea of women warriors, at least have the woman doing actual martial arts, and getting it right. Since when does Chinese Wushu involve a khatana or Samarai sword? I guessI thought somehow this would have some sort of redeeming quality. It may be a good movie if you enjoy severed limbs and fake blood, but to cloak it under any sort of martial arts is degrading to the art itself. The second movie was a little better plot wise, but still not worth the money it costs to rent or watch it at the theater. Go watch a Jet Li or Jackie Chan if you like martial arts, don't waste your time on this.If you are a fan of Tarantino this is the movie for you, it follows in the same vein as his other movies.IE Pulp Fiction, Resevoir dogs, ect. It may be watchable for the cimematic quality, or the dry spagetthi western humor. But if you are a martial arts purist, don't see this it will only disappoint.
B000059TPI|5.0|This is a perfect film adaptation of Mary Chase's delightful, beautifully constructed farce about good-natured Elwood P. Dowd, who chooses to live life as a fantasy with his best friend, an imaginary (or not-so-imaginary!) human-sized rabbit called Harvey.  Jimmy Stewart, in the prime of his career, is completely in character as Elwood, while Josephine Hull gives the performance of a lifetime as his sister, Veta Louise, who in trying to commit Elwood to a sanitarium, temporarily commits herself instead!  The scene set in the back alley of a bar, in which Elwood explains his way of life to the sanitarium's doctor and nurse, is a classic. <br /> <br /> <br />

B0001UL7RY|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this album. I love avril, but she could have done better than this. <br /> <br />1.Take Me Away- nothing great, kinda boring 6/10 <br />2.Together- I like it, but she isnt really singing 8/10 <br />3.Don't Tell Me- I like this 1 a lot. Great lyrics, great message. 10/10 <br />4.He Wasnt- catchy; a good sunday song, something like sk8er boi 9/10 <br />5.How Does It Feel- should never even been on the album 3/10 <br />6.My Happy Ending- great song; catchy but 1 line bothers me so much: lets talk this over its not like we're DEAD, was it something i did, was it something u said, dont leave me hanging in a city so DEAD. u cant rhyme dead with dead! Besides that and being over pleayed on the radio, it isnt painful. 9/10 <br />7.Nobody's Home- Best song on the album. Most avril fans agree with me here. The lyrics are awesome and i totally relate. The music video sucks tho, but she herself agrees with me on that! 10/10 <br />8.Forgotten- you feel like your walking down stairs with this melody. not that bad, could have been better. 9/10 <br />9. Who Knows- somewhat retarded with the lyrics. I still like it tho 7.5/10 <br />10. Fall to Pieces- love the lyrics, every1 has been thro this. But the music blends too much and gets boring like 2mins into it 8/10 <br />11.Freak Out- I love this song, its so catchy! but if u look at the lyrics you wonder what she's trying to say 'just freak out let it go' Huh? Whatever, still good becuz of the music. 9.5/10 <br />12.Slipped Away-descent, kinda sad. 8/10 <br /> <br />Good Luck next CD Av!
B0001I55OC|1.0|This film could have been great. The incredible battle sequences at the castle and the detail on the medieval customs and architecture were wasted on the poorest adaptation of a book I have ever seen. This should have been split into two movies (ala Lord of the Rings) or at the very least run a half hour longer. <br /> <br />Too much of the exisitng footage was wasted on implausible escapes and mindless chases, and not enough set-up was engineered to make the audience believe in time travel or what the connection was between the archeological dig and the medieval war. The concept of the little time-transport amulets idiotic and I found myself neither caring which side won (Emglish vs. French) nor understanding why they were fighting.  <br /> <br />There was nothing in this film to capture my imagination. Just a whirlwind of disjointed action sequences splendidly filmed and passably acted.
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 has done things that most musicians only dream of.  They have written gut-wrenching anthems fueled with political strife.  They have reached into the deepest recesses of the human soul and have produced some of the most beautifully depressing personal affirmations in history.  Songs like \\"Kite\\" from ATYCLB, \\"With or Without You\\" from Joshua Tree, \\"One\\" from Achtung Baby, \\"Drowning Man\\" from War.  All of these songs stand as some of the greatest odes to the human condition and conjure tears from listeners willing to hear what they have to say.  These points are important, for I mentioned songs dating from 1983-2000 and the fact that their greatness is spread over such a long period of time is the point of this review. <br /> <br />How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is a very good effort from a band that is unmatched in this day and age.  The new record starts off with a fun and forceful \\"Vertigo\\" very much calling back to the fact that they are indeed a band that was established in 1979.  \\"Miracle Drug\\" is a beautiful ballad that permeates the chaotic feeling of today's world very well, but more than that it directs the direction of the rest of the album.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is really where U2 shines here, for this is a song that comes close to the songs I mentioned in the previous list, but it may fall short of being as close to immortal as possible.  Tracks 4 and 5 are pretty standard offerings from the band and \\"All Because Of You\\" very much calls back to 1988 with Rattle and Hum.  The rest of the album finishes out in the tradition of U2. <br /> <br />The fact here is that this is a good album, but it falls short of the title of classic.  War, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby are far and away works of genius, for they seized a moment in time and recorded it on three disks, expressing the purest forms of angst, anger, fear, solitude, depression, desolation...  They did it all on these three albums.  HTDAAB is a great offering, but no one song on this record has the timeless qualities of a classic album.  The songs are strong and the production is top notch even if a bit overbearing at times.  This album fits well in the U2 canon and I would argue that it sits quite well with ATYCLB and The Unforgettable fire as albums with strong songs but not epic sustainability.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" and \\"A Man and a Woman\\" are fantastic offerings that serve this album the way that \\"Kite\\" served ATYCLB.  \\"Kite\\" was the best song written since \\"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\\" in 1998 and they came close on this album to writing songs with as much passion and meaning as were in those.  In the end, they fell short of immortality with this offering. <br /> <br />Seeing as War was preceded with October and Boy, Joshua Tree was surrounded with the learning palates of Unforgettable Fire and Rattle and Hum, Achtung Baby was followed with Zooropa and Pop, I have no doubt that U2 could very well have an ace up their sleeve.  With ATYCLB and HTDAAB behind them, they may have very well set the stage for the next stroke of genius in their careers.  They didn't do it this time, but hell, there is nothing wrong with having a few great albums preparing the way for genius. <br />
B000021YQV|4.0|Ok, first off, I saw a reference to Evanescence. No. We don't do that here. If you want to be taken serously, don't talk about crappy pop bands in a SoaD page. Secondly, Nine Inch Nails sucks. They always did, and they still do. Thirdly, RAtM is a pretty good band, and there is no sence in trashing them, just because you don't like the way Zac De La Roca raps in some songs. Next, SoaD is a good band, too. Don't come in here throwing around your third grade insults and useless curses just cause you don't like them, or don't agree with someone else's oppinion, no matter how wrong they may be. Next, no one will ever be right about getting an abortion, and you are a sick person for suggestion that the world would be a better place if someone hadn't been in it. This is what everyone fears about Rock music. You guys have no oppinions of your own. You believe only what Zac or Serj tell you to believe. I like both of those bands, but I can honestly say I think their views are completely wrong. I'm a Christian and I listen to Incubus, SoaD, RAtM, and plenty of other music that isn't necessiarly Christian, but I don't let any of it warp my mind. Meagalomaniac(Incubus) didn't make me want to vote Kerry. Born As Ghosts(RAtM) didn't make me want to send money to any third-world countries. A.D.D.(SoaD) didn't make me curse the American government. You guys need to quit taking things so seriously and just let this stuff go. <br /> <br />By the way, Toxicity is a great album. Serj Tankien cranks it up to ten on some songs, and down low on others. \\"X\\" is just amazing drumming at it's best. \\"Bounce\\" will be stuck in your head for days. On the flip side, \\"Jet Pilot\\" is alot of noise the first several times you hear it. Once you get used to this album, you will enjoy it, though...
B00025ETIW|4.0|MCR sparked my interest after I saw the newest music video for \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\". I listened to a few other songs and ended up buying Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. I was surprised and happy to find that the other songs weren't as poppy and mainstream as I'm Not Okay (I Promise). So a message to those who first hear about MCR from this song (since it's been played so much): If you can't stand the poppyness, don't give up on MCR; give the rest of the CD a try. If you are absolutely in love with the poppyness, listen to the other songs on the album before buying it. The other songs are quite a bit darker and not exactly your typical MTV lineup sort of thing.  <br /> <br />That being said, the other songs are still catchy but they do have a bit more depth to them. I hope that MCR doesn't fall victim too much to the rabid MTV crowd. I'll still listen, but it would be a sad fate.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I don't even know where to start. I was not a big fan of Evanescence or even Amy Lee until about 6 months ago. I use to turn my radio off everytime I had to here \\"Bring me to life\\" on the radio. It drove me nuts because they played it so much. Then one day I bought a used copy of \\"Fallen\\" because I loved the song \\"Going Under\\" and I actually sat down and listened to the lyrics. I was hooked. Now I love EVERY single song on \\"Fallen\\" including \\"Bring me to life\\" and I regret that I never took the time to listen to Evanescence and Amy Lee properly before until 6 months ago. The lyrics to this band are amazing. I don't understand why people compare Evanescence to Lacuna Coil. Both Band's are so different and personally I think Amy Lyrics are more beautiful and mature then Lacuna Coils anyway. I bought \\"Anywhere But Home\\" the very day it was released. I went home, sat down and saw the DVD first. I LOVED it. I wasn't very fond of the camera angles for the live concert. I think the moving angles back and forth are a bit annoying. I perfer the camera being on Amy Lee and The Band then so much to the audience and to let it be in one place and angle then going back and forth and ect, but other then that the live concert is amazing. Amy Lee is amazing and so is the band. The music videos are great to have too. My favorite part of the DVD has to be the extras. I love the way Amy's personality shines threw when you see her backstage. You see her roller skating, doing back flips, dancing around like a chicken, getting dressed, putting on her makeup and just clowning around like any other 22 year old girl. It was refreshing to see that because seeing how dark and personal her lyrics are, anyone would think Amy was some kind of dark moody person. But seeing her in action and laughing and clowning around like that was cool. There is a scary part in the DVD where some crazy guy jumped on stage and tried to get Amy and security had to get him down. Anyway, the behind the scenes part in the DVD is awesome. The Live CD is incredible. I have been listening to it since I bought it tuesday. I love the song \\"Thoughtless\\" and had no idea who wrote the song. I looked it up on the internet and found out it was Korn who wrote that song. I have to say it's a beautiful song and I will have to hear Korn's version someday.<br /><br />Anyway that's my review.

B000001DTM|5.0|'Achtung Baby\\" is U2's greatest creation.  From the depths of human despair and solitude comes this album which truly was a reinvention.  With the coming of the grunge era, U2 anticipated perfectly the fact that they were going to have to push the envelope, for following an act such as \\"Joshua Tree\\" would simply be impossible.  Once the Mona Lisa is painted, you can't paint it again.  U2 realized this back then and made the perfect move.    From the very beginning listeners are launched into sonic reinvention that is staggering.  \\"Zoo Station\\" is a masterful welcome to a completely new era of U2 and provides the perfect introduction to the new project.  \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\" provides a brilliant stepping stone down form the porch into the main hallway where we are then taken to the grand ballroom of music itself.  \\"One\\" could very well be the finest ballad ever recorded, for it captures just about every mode of human expression and packs it into the product of four men trying to find their place within the world.  I am just thankful that they invited the rest of us to join them for the ride.    Next stop \\"Until the End of the World\\" where we deal with the most fundamental feelings fueled by fear and betrayal.  The imagery created in this Judas vs. Jesus paradigm is brilliant and brings to life the classic themes of human existence.  The next two tunes are brilliant bridges to the latter part of the album, providing very intimate portraits of doubt after change and laments with regard to the cruelty and desolation that only something as profound as love can create.    \\"The Fly\\" is a perfect satire of the world even 13 years after the album's release.  From its sonic pioneering to its poignant and brutally honest lyrics, it serves as a mid-album re-introduction, just incase people started wandering around in the halls of the record, which is easy to do with a band covering just about every nuance of the human condition.    The album has the strongest ending of any I have ever encountered.  With \\"Acrobat\\" and \\"Love is Blindness\\" is a back to back knock out, highlighting the fact that the fight is not over and that we must never let the [...] get us down, even when there is \\"no call and no warning,\\" leading to a \\"dangerous idea that almost makes sense...\\"      Quite simply, this album is the greatest album ever written and this review has done it absolutely no justice.  As a matter of fact I almost erased this review completely, feeling that I am not worthy to deconstruct the perfection that it is.  I will leave it there, for honestly after listening to this record hundreds of times, I am still at a loss for words which is where the genius of the album lies.  The album speaks volumes and interprets love, loss, betrayal and solitude in ways that few artists can.  I don't know where I would be had I not had this album to keep me company on so many dark nights.
B00066N8JS|5.0|To hear this already masterpiece of an album digitally remastered and remixed for 5.1 surround audio, it's enough to make a grown man weep.  The bass is heavier and the sound is much sharper.  I must give credit where credit is due: Trent Reznor outdid himself once again by making an already perfect album even better.  The second disc is an incredibly good mix CD of some of NIN's best remixes, movie soundtrack songs, and a couple of previously unreleased goodies to top it off.  I was a bit disappointed that \\"The Perfect Drug\\" didn't make it on there, but it still includes the songs created outside of TDS including \\"Burn\\" (Natural Born Killers), \\"Closer (precursor)\\" (Se7en), and \\"Dead Souls\\" (The Crow).  In other words, if you're a NIN fan, even if you already own the original as I do, I highly recommend this album for the sheer quality you get from it.  Enjoy
0312263120|4.0|I am not much of a book reader but this was one book I had a hard time putting down and was able to reader quick. The way the book is written is classic Dan Brown style and makes it easy to pick up and read for 10 min or sit for an hour and read. Story was good but did fall a little short of a 5 star story line for me.
0385510438|4.0|It's been a while since I had read my last Grisham novel so I rather enjoyed this one.  I was a little surprised that this novel was not so much a courtroom thriller than it was about a 23-year old newspaperman, Willie Traynor, who covers a horrific murder trail involving of the town's more unsavory citizens.   Therein, most of the storyline takes place outside of the courthouse.      While I didn't find \\"The Last Juror\\" to be as tautly written (suspense-wise or action-wise) as some of Grisham's earlier works  I did find that it still had much of elements that made me a follower of his works.  His intriguing storyline, his wry humor and his endearing treatment of his characters were still evident.   Grisham fans should not be disappointed by \\"The Last Juror.\\"  It will provide a quick, enjoyable read.
B0006399FS|4.0|Did someone say they prefer Ashlee Simpson... Too bad she <br />lip syncs in public... U2 is the last great rock and roll <br />band - that is still recording great music. Atomic Bomb <br />is a great album. Only time will determine how great it will become. Just Say no to Boy Bands, and lip syncing in <br />public.
B0006399FS|4.0|This is the album I've been waiting for since Boy and October - a refreshing departure from Zoo TV.  It's like going back to church.  Weakness: some dead spots and some odd lyrics.
0694003611|5.0|Both my 2 year old and I love this book.  It's a cute book and keeps him occupied with the many familiar things he can pick out and identify, such as the moon, stars, balloon, bunny, etc...  We've had it a while and he still gets a lot out of it!  :)
B0006399FS|4.0|All that you can't leave behind was half an album, interesting 4 or 5 first songs, the rest a total bomb. Let's also say that Vertigo is a much better song than Beautiful Day.  <br />\\"Bomb\\" is intersting from start to finish, nothing sounds new, nothing experimental, but enjoyable songs and music.  <br />The Cd is worth buying for the song City of Lights alone. I think it's a wonderful song, should be the next single.  <br />All because of you is catchy, but, City of lights is the hightlight here, they should release that song next... <br />
140003180X|4.0|\\"The Kalahari Typing School for Men\\" belongs to the category of feel-good, heartwarming, inspirational and life-affirming fiction. Reading it reminds me of books of similar genre such as \\"The Alchemist\\". But what sets it apart from the rest are its simple yet powerful writing, unique suburban setting in Botswana Africa and captivating detective storyline charted forward by Precious Ramotswe. The characterization of Precious Romatswe is so effectively done that the reader genuinely feels for her, thinks like her and connects with her. Plot aside, what I find so refreshing in this book is the nostalgic feel for the old simple way of life in Botswana when foreign influences were kept to a minimal and people upheld morals and traditional values.<br /><br />The novel sends an upliftingly positive message to the readers and incorporates various insights on life, that are universally true and equally relevant, be it in Africa, the West, Japan, China or Southeast Asia. One such insight that remains etched in my mind is, \\"... it is possible to change the world, if one is determined enough, and if one sees with sufficient clarity just what it is that has to be changed\\". In a nutshell, this book successfully integrates humour with solemnness. You will undoubtedly crave for more in this series of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Though not a big fan of Ben Affleck (just the whole J-LO thing annoyed the heck out of me), I must say he did a great job at portaying Matt Murdock.  I think he played a blind man well.  He really did justice to  the MURDOCK/DAREDEVIL character.  And he really looked like daredevil in the outfit like in the comic books.  His on-screen chemistry with Electra was great.  I'm  skepical when they change genders or races of characters but the african american actor who played KINGPIN really gave a cool twist to the character and made him more interesting.  in the comic, KINGPIN just seems to be this rich, blobby fat white guy who is just plain greedy and without scruples.  BULLSEYE was an awesome villian and Colin Farrell played him great!!  the movie is fast moving and cut to the chase with the origin.(unlike the HULK, where you sat there watching saying to yourself \\"when's something interesting gonna happen?\\" in the 1st 35 minutes of the film!)  The star and all supporting characters/actors fit very well in the story.  effects on how Daredevil's \\"radar\\" worked was really kool.  I actally think the movie is action packed and is a positive story about a poor kid who even got a harder blow in life by becoming blind, yet, learns to adapt to the world blindly with his new \\"radar\\", has to suffer the brutal loss of his father yet, stills works to get out of \\"hell's kitchen\\", becomes a lawyer PLUS gets to become a super hero and finally everything comes full circle when he goes head to head with his father's killer the kingpin and finally brings him to justice.  It's a really good movie portaying a man who reached his goals dispite the obsticles life had handed him..I think it's great a longer R Rated version is being released---a whole half hour more of movie  is  BONUS MATERIAL there! (some poeple complain it being just 1 disc, but when they add to the movie another 30 minutes to tell more of the story, show move action sequences, who cares? how many times do you really watch those extras anyways?).  Hopefully another Daredevil movie will be made...this was one of the best ones released yet.        '
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie really captured Jane Austin's book quite well it made the book come alive for me and was very compelling . It kept you interested and in suspence the entire movie . For anyone who enjoys a indepth and truly romantic movie this is the one for you . I rate it 5 stars !
B0006284JQ|4.0|If you're a fan of Britney Spears, you would already own most of the songs. If you're a casual listener, this cd includes most of her singles, and \\"Boys\\", \\"Overprotected\\" and \\"Crazy\\" appear in their video version.  Of the three new songs, I find \\"Having fun\\" excellent.  The great addition is that it comes with a bonus cd, of which I find that the only good remixes are the ones for \\"everytime\\" and \\"outrageous\\".  If you like Britney Spears or some of her songs, I definitely recomend buying this cd. <br /> <br />PS.  She has a lot of b-sides, released in other countries.  It would be a great idea to have them all available in a cd.  Maybe the record company should consider this, now that she's retiring for a while.
B0002SROT0|4.0|Like every Elliott album, From a Basement grows on you more and more with each listen. After hearing a handful of live recordings of this material before the album was released, my expectations were very different since the versions I had heard were very stripped down, raw, and beautiful like most of Elliott's live performances. While very different in their arrangement and texture, the studio recordings of these songs certainly don't disappoint. The album feels like the most cohesive effort of Elliott's since Either/Or. He has not only solidified himself as one of the greatest songwriters of his time, but also as a true master of the studio as a multi-instrumentalist with the ability to add so much color and harmony to his music.
B00005JMAH|5.0|In his attempt to bring Harry Potter to the screen with his first two installments, Columbus was so laborious in carbon-copying the book to screen, that he forgot the more essential elements of adaptation, and of screen time. <br /> <br />While I'm sure soccer moms and younger kids will probably be more attached to the saccharine visions perpetuated by the first two films, it seemed that those films were just trying too hard.  All the kodak imagery, the lack of character depth, the awkward pacing---Columbus's hands were wet with effort, and it stained the films more or less. <br /> <br />The 2nd film was a vast improvement, don't get me wrong.  But the films still lacked something more visceral. <br /> <br />Harry Potter TPOA, is a film that finally brings Harry's world to the screen in a way that the previous attempts could not acheive.  I'm so over joyed at the direction that Cuaron has taken with this film. <br /> <br />He frees himself of CGI locations (more or less), and shoots on locations.  Yes, Hogwarts looks different in this film, but when you have a different artist doing the tranlation, there are going to be some visual differences.  And this time, it FEELS REAL. <br /> <br />Ask any comic book collector what the Bat-cave looks like, and he/she'll tell you that it depends what artist is drawing it. <br /> <br />I actually found it to be an improvement. <br /> <br />Cuaron really focuses on the young actors' growth as actors.  No longer do we see them in quick cut close ups, as to not notice their greeness in the acting world.  Now they are compelled to act in longer camera shots, with more complex character psychology, and just a more compelling script. <br /> <br />But what's more important is that this film feels magical.  MAGIC FEELS REAL.  The scares are real, not those cinematic 'everybody's going to be okay, we can see the troll is really a poorly drawn cartoon and is acting all dumb and silly' scare--but a real, deep in our guts 'are these characters going to make it?' scare.  And it's this type of visceral experience that young kids really need.  If a kid, growing up, is going to learn how to face fears, he/she must be able to handle something like this film.  To laugh it off later as a film. If we shield the child from films such as this, they're going to face a losing battle when they enter the 'real world.' <br /> <br />The performances from all the characters are dazzling, but one of note is Dumbledore.  Yes, it's a different actor, Michael Gambon (the original Singing Detective, and featured in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow), who dons the robe and hat vacated by the late and brilliant Richard Harris.   <br /> <br />Rather than trying to shun his acting responsibilities with a poor impersonation of Harris, he creates his own character--and one that seems far closer to the source material.  A strange hippie of sorts.  He seems a bit crazy from the outset, but then we see how he can spin his own magic, and by the end of the film, I was cheering for him.  \\"Good night\\" indeed.   <br /> <br />Finally a word on adaptation:  This was the longest of the 3 books adapted so far. Material is going to be cut out for narrative considerations.  It's translating one medium to another.  It can't be a literal translation, or you'll bore the audience with plot elements that, although interesting in the book, just wouldn't work in the film.  But that's the process of adaptation.  If you want the book, then read the book.  This is an entirely different medium with its own rules.  Cuaron understands that.  Columbus, for the most part, did not.   <br /> <br />I found the streamlined narrative to be exhilarating, liberating, and just a great time--the kids I was with all enjoyed the film immensly as well.  A real family film.  Perfect for the kid at just about any age.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is incredible.  It's vintage U2, sounding very similar to their earlier albums.  Keep in mind that this is an album that has to grow on you.  You may not appreciate it at first listen.  But, with each listen, it becomes better and better.  U2 continue to deal with common themes throughout their music--love, faith, etc.  In my opinion, this ranks up there with the best of U2 (for example, Joshua Tree) and without a doubt, it is one of the best albums that I've heard in a while (and I make it a point to hear ALOT of new music).  Buy this now!
B0000035E7|4.0|Some people may not know this, but grunge was originally one-half metal.  Everyone says that metal was wiped out in the early nineties by grunge, but in reality glam metal was just pushed to the side by a less excessive form of metal.  Grunge was metal that focused less on instrumental skill and more on experimentation and innovation.  Nirvana's \\"Bleach\\" is a prime example of the metal influence on grunge. <br />Kurt Cobain often cited AC/DC and Black Sabbath as influences.  Much like their hometown counterparts, the Melvins, Nirvana took the sludgy sound of Black Sabbath and threw out the guitar solos and cheesy mystical lyrics.  He added some feedback and wild vocals to give their sound a bit of a punk edge. <br />Sludge punk metal is the formula used through much of the record, but there were a couple experimental pieces that marked the direction they would take on their next albums.  \\"About a Girl\\" and \\"Love Buzz\\" were demented pop songs that usually get this album the most praise from the critics, but they're hardly the strongest tracks.  \\"Negative Creep\\" and \\"School\\" are driven by killer metal riffs and manic punk rock energy, which are the best songs on the album. <br />Other songs like \\"Paper Cuts\\" and \\"Sifting\\" are oppressively heavy and could be easily mistaken for a Melvins song. <br />Fans of Nirvana's later pop hook oriented material may not like this album, but fans of sludge metal may be quite pleased with it.  Most metal fans may hate Nirvana and all other grunge just because it helped propel weaker, softer alternative rock (think Oasis, Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins) into the mainstream, but if they look past the associations and deeper into grunge they may find some very respectable forms of metal.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This cd is basically a disgrace to ALL Britney fans. As a far-away liker of Britney Spears from the beginning, I was appalled! This pop/techno cd is unlike any other Britney album. \\"In The Zone\\" has some good songs like \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everyime\\", but the rest aren't really worth your 13 dollars. The songs on \\"In The Zone\\" are very selfish and over-sexy( It's super hard to be OVER-SEXY, but she pulled it off!)Most of the songs on the album sound like they're a computer or a back-up singer.If you need a dance song or etc., look here. But if you want a true Britney album, I suggest her Greatest Hits: My Perogative or Oops, I Did It Again!, some true hits.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|after the rather downplayed ragpicker's dream and the scratchy sailing to philadelphia, mark knopfler displays the kind of songwriting genius that has won him fans and critics around the world. shangri la is a wonderfully mellow and fleetingly sublime album that capture the essence of a good melody while driving emotions right through the heart. from the opening subtle drama of \\"5.15\\" to the delightful \\"boom, like that\\" and the mellow \\"shangri la\\" and the funny \\"whoop de doo\\" knpfler shows stunning touch and musical form in this collection of high quality delights that are consistently listenable. <br /> <br />a must for all knopfler fans, this is also a wonderful place to begin if you have heard of but never heard this great singer-songwriter.
B000687M48|5.0|This is a great cd and DVD- Amy Lee roller skating, inside jokes, pranks, not to mention that Missing is now one of my favorite Evanescence songs ever... well worth the money.  Farther Away is a great song, and I've always loved Breathe No More but that version was kickin! Stop listening to me and buy it!
0812550706|5.0|I hate science fiction and I absolutely loved this book. It was great. I ended up reading the book in two nights because it was too hard for me to wait and see what happens. If you love science fiction you will love this book, and if you hate science fiction like me, you'll still love this book.
B0002KVUKW|2.0|The multi talented Hugh Jackman in an obvious money grab plays the title role in the predominantly awful flick \\"Van Helsing\\".  A monster vanquisher commisssioned by the Vatican, he is assigned to rid the Romanian countryside of Count Dracula and his 3 brides in 1888.  He is also endeavoring to save the surviving members of the Valerious family, sworn enemies of the vampirish count.<br /><br />Jackman, laughingly garbed in contemporary clothing is accompanied by sidekick Carl played by David Wenham.  Carl is to Van Helsing what Q is to James Bond, supplying him with an array of high tech weaponry.  Dracula played by Aussie Richard Roxburgh, better known as the Duke in Moulin Rouge, has every monster ever created at his disposal with the exception of the Invisible Man.<br /><br />While the special effects are pretty good, the movie is unfortunately a juvenile piece of garbage.  The highlight of the film is the alluring Kate Beckinsale, playing Anna Valerious, whose raven haired beauty lights up the screen and even managed to sustain her Transylvanian accent.
0446607274|5.0|ANGEL'S FLIGHT is the sixth book in Connelly's ongoing Harry Bosch series. It's also the sixth one I've read and I have yet to be disappointed. Not only does Connelly give the reader an engaging plot with plenty of surprises, but the development of Harry Bosch throughout the series makes each installment something like meeting up with an old friend. In ANGEL'S FLIGHT, Harry is put in charge of the investigation into the murder of a prominent black lawyer involved in a suit against the LAPD. Set against the backdrop of a riot-torn city, the situation is both complex and very tense. At the same time, Harry is forced to deal with domestic troubles of his own.<br /><br />Connelly is an acknowledged master of the hard-boiled police procedural and, while this isn't my favorite genre, he's never let me down. If you're new to Harry Bosch, however, don't start here. Start with THE BLACK ECHO and take them in order. They can all stand on their own, but Harry's life is a work in progress and is never far from the surface. I highly recommend Connelly's work, in general. ANGEL'S FLIGHT is certainly no exception.
B00006NSGX|2.0|I've always been a fan of Eric Clapton's music, especielly the bluesy stuff, and I've usually enjoyed his live recordings, but this one was an utter disappointment. Amazon suggests that you buy it along with Clapton's recent \\"Me And Mr Johnson\\", and those two are indeed something of a pair.    Disc one is the worst, consisting of a mixture of older songs (such as a reasonably good, acoustic and quite Bill Broonzy-esque rendition of \\"Key To The Highway\\"), and long, tedious versions of newer material like \\"My Father's Eyes\\", \\"River Of Tears\\" and the awful, preachy, weepy, Michael Jackson-like \\"Change The World\\".  But even the blues material doesn't sound bluesy anymore, and I actually didn't recognize Jimmy Oden's classic \\"Goin' Down Slow\\" at first. In what must easily be the worst recording of this tune ever, Clapton turns it into a happy, bouncing little pop song with just a hint of jazz and no blues feel whatsoever.    Disc two fares a little bit better, at least when it comes to the choice of songs. But both \\"Badge\\", \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\" and \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" sound bland and uninspired, partly because Clapton's band don't know how to play the blues. Or perhaps they've been told not to, and that's why everything sounds the same.    One thing is for sure: there's nothing here which isn't already out there in much, much better recordings - many of them by Eric Clapton himself. If you want live, go for \\"Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert\\" or \\"Timepieces vol. II\\", and if you want to hear the great blues player that Mr Clapton undoubtedly is, listen to \\"From The Cradle\\", or spring for the wonderful box set retrospective \\"Crossroads\\". Or both!  This album certainly shows how the great Eric Clapton has evolved through the years - from a bluesman to a mushy balladeer. And when you've heard him do \\"Mean Old World\\" with Duane Allman, listening to these slick and often overblown Vegas-renditions of his classic songs makes you wonder if he'll turn up in a white jumpsuit on his next tour.    \\"One More Car\\" is definitely not for those who enjoy Eric Clapton the bluesman or even Eric Clapton the rock singer, but perhaps those who prefer Eric Clapton the balladeer might find something here worth their while.  I didn't, though, and hearing Eric Clapton, the man who was nicknamed \\"God\\" 39 years ago, when he was only 20, turning into a lounge lizard and doing \\"Over The Rainbow\\" for a closing number actually made me consider throwing the CD away.  But in the end I didn't. I just sold it on eBay.
0375507256|5.0|There is litte I can write that hasn't already been written by others of your reviewers about this sublime novel...but I can't resist.  Cloud Atlas is the best new book I have read in years.  I was literally thrilled while reading it and called and emailed numerous friends to urge them to go buy it and read it immediately. <br /> <br />I knew by the third page of this book that it was going to be challenging, which I like.  What I didn't realize (until about page 25) was how extremely enjoyable it would be.  It's funny, poignant, unique, revolutionary, touching, scary, and a bit of a kick in the pants. <br /> <br />I marvel at the talent of David Mitchell and thank heaven that writers of his caliber are still out there striving to achieve something new, fresh, and exciting.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'll preface these thoughts by stating that I am a long-time Radiohead fan who thinks that no band in existence has done as much as Thom Yorke and the boys to broaden the spectrum of rock music.  With that said, Muse, while sounding much like Radiohead, goes places that Radiohead could never dream of going.  While Radiohead has exhibited nearly endless musical genius and ability to reinvent themselves, they simply lack the technical expertise that Muse displays on their albums.  Muse integrates intricate classical piano lines, hard-hitting, technically-perfect guitar playing, and incredible, never-off-key vocals.  Their lyrics are probably more accessible than Radiohead's as well.  Absolution, as an album, is the best of Muse's work to date.  The songs here show depth in their lyrics and production.  If you like hard-hitting, melodic rock music, this is definitely something you should check out.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The Phantom Menace <br />Attack Of The Clones <br />Revenge Of The Sith <br />A New Hope <br />The Empire Strikes Back <br />Return of The Jedi <br /> <br />Such wonderful films, Revenge Of The Sith isn't out yet, but is getting ready to show how well the prequal trilogy and original trilogy come together to become the definative STAR WARS SAGA. These films have gone through some changes, but one thing to remember is is that George Lucas has given us fans an outlet for us to understand each other on some kind of level. If you're an all around Star Wars fan, a fan of the prequal and original trilogy, then you understand what I'm talking about. For the ones that just like the originals, you'll understand once you see all of the movies as one piece. I've said it before and I'll say it again \\"This is so exciting on so many levels!\\"
B000001K2V|5.0|Walter Klien is a superb interpreter of Mozart's piano music. His is a style that exemplifies the best of the Viennese school pianism: no extremes in dynamics, fluid phrasing, every note polished to a beautiful sheen. Klien is not the only exponent of this school, of course; Ingrid Haebler, Lili Kraus and Christoph Eschenbach are also notable holders of this tradition. But Klien's set is probably the most competitively priced of them all, and is a fine introduction for anyone wishing to become acquainted with this music.  <br /> <br />This volume also contains some of Mozart's most famous piano music: the incredible outpouring of creativity in the 3 Sonatas from K 331 to K 333 (i.e. the well-known Turkish March of K. 331, and the extended virtuosic Rondos in both K. 332 and K. 333); the weighty Fantasia and Sonata in C Minor; the fine contrapuntal writings in the late masterpiece K. 576; and the ubiquitous C Major \\"Easy\\" Sonata, K. 545. You won't go wrong with this set.
B00003CX5P|5.0|George Lucas really has been able to do what every Star Wars fan wanted, he has started to complete the definitive circle of his lifes work on the number one story in the world, STAR WARS. <br />The Phantom Menace has shown how great the story of everyone's demise of where they ended up in A New Hope. This movie contains a line that everybody has wanted to hear for a long time \\"Obi-Wan Kenobi, met Anakin Skywalker\\". This is truely exciting on so many levels.
0553213105|1.0|I tried to read it, but I couldn't. I put it down at about page 100. From a fan of IMMANUEL KANT, this was too boring. Honestly, after I put it down, I had to study the Diamond Sutra and the Book of Job to get the vapid feeling out of my head. Someone on here wrote something to the effect of \\"as Blake saw the world in a grain of sand, so did Austen see the world in a drawing room\\". To this, I'd say that there is a vast difference in seeing the world in a drawing room, and thinking that the world IS a drawing room.<br /><br />Basically, it felt way too narrow for me. I will admit that I dislike British culture, as a whole, and have yet to make it through a third Dickens novel (have tried four). Still, I am a huge fan of Fielding, Defoe, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and like a few other English authors.
B00009TB5G|5.0|A wonderful sequal, if that's what you wanna call it. I call it a second act to a wonderful book. I can't complain on these movies in general. They are just so well made and told. Peter Jackson has my respect on the way movies are made today, just as much as George Lucas. Let's face it if George Lucas had never came along, these movie would've never been this great. Kudos to Peter Jackson and even more so to George Lucas.
B00018D44U|4.0|When I first purchased this cd, I was waiting to be blown away like I was with come away with me. I wasn't. In fact I took the cd off after song #4 Carnivial Town. I just wasn't feeling it. I forgot that I bought the cd about 4 months ago and I came across it again. I put it back in and this time I let the entire cd play. I have to say I enjoyed it alot better the second time around. It had to grow on me. It is still a nice cd to listen to any time of the day. I'm suprised that some people who write reviews about Norah Jones don't like her. I am not a baby boomer (I'm 28) and I happen to enjoy her music very much. No she is not jummping up and down with her [...] hanging out of clothing that a two year could wear. No she is not using vulgar language and wearing pink, yellow, green or shocking blue hair. She is not onstage shaking her body like she having a convulsion. No that is not her. If that is what you are looking for then go elsewhere. This is not your type of music. Her music has depth and it's from the heart. It's pure and natural. Just refreshing. I would not call her a musical genuis, that is reserved for Marvin Gaye, Issac Hayes, and Curtis Mayfield and the like. However, Norah Jones comes in a package of her own that is not being done today. That's why she is so popular. Her music has been heard in several romantic films such as Alex and Emma and two weeks notice. She is doing something right! I enjoyed her music. We must become a society that learns to respect people for their difference in arts, religion, music and entertainment. Norah Jones may not be your ideal of a good musician, yet she is that for somebody and that makes her crediable! All Norah Jones fans give a shout out loud.
B00005JLEX|1.0|Don't give any more money to this movie, Seinfeld is already rich enough, too much for his own good. I like the series but it would be wasted money to buy this, spend your money on \\"The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition Collector's Gift Set)\\" if you already have the extended editions of Fellowship and Two Towers, if you don't buy \\"The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended DVD Edition)\\".
B00042YL4A|5.0|When I found out the Deluxe Edition series was adding The Lexicon Of Love to their catalog, I was very excited.  Since there was already a remaster, I was more interested in the bonus tracks.  Well, both discs are brilliant.  This time, The Lexicon Of Love was truly remastered - it sounds better than the first round - you can tell immediately on Show Me. It was a much better job from the master. <br /> <br />The bonus stuff is worth it's weight in gold.  The demos are my favorite as the songs are stripped down an a little undeveloped.  It's cool to hear the genesis of song without the added production   <br /> <br />I have a live show from Germany (same tour) which is excellent.  This one is from the Hammersmith 1982.  If you have not heard the full live set from this tour - you are in for complete treat.  Very classy.   <br /> <br />OH - pretty important if you want to save some cash.  I bought mine from Amazon UK.  For everything, the price was under $30.00.  For some reason, our Amazon could not get the price lower.  So, go there and save $10.00     <br /> <br />
B000002L9J|5.0|What's great about this album is it is very strange, but it is so darn good. As usual the lyrics are marred with strangeness, and so are the lyrics. But the offbeat lyrics make the Smiths who they are. Catchy melodies fill the album, and feelings of smiling because it is so good overcome you. And it sounds like it comes so naturally too. Despite the failings of one hit wonders in the 80's who tried to keep making great stuff, but faded into 80's only listening, these guys managed to keep their heads above water, and make albums full of great stuff.
B0002Y69NG|1.0|Oh boy, a ten disk set. But does one fairly entertaining movie really merit 9 bonus disks? Sure, the first Matrix movie was entertaining, enough so for me to have bought it on DVD. The two newer \\"movies,\\" however, are what I like to think of as miscarriages by the Watchawski Bros. <br />And hideous they are. All the greasy and filthy people in the twenty minuet rave scene at the beginning of Reloaded are enough to make you queasy. But when the acting kicks in is when you really get sick. Yes, the movies still star Keanu Reeves. No, he still can't act. The highway scene was also plain stupid. I know that when I'm driving and see people in the cars in front of me shooting at each other, I don't slow down, and in fact never consider even breaking even as I run into the ramp that the car in front of me is dragging behind it for some reason. <br />And did anyone notice the entire first third of Revolutions? Where Keanu Reeves is stuck in the subway? How it had noting to do with the story and could have been omitted entirely? Call Guinness- I think we have a new world record for the largest padding of any film. And then the fight at the end of Revolutions- lets just say if I want to watch Dragon Ball Z, I'll watch Dragon Ball Z. Oh yes, and Carrie-Anne Moss dying at the end was plain comical. She fights hundreds of malefactors, dodging bullets and flying around in slow motion- and she dies by falling in to some rebar. And wasn't it because they decided going really fast and crashing would be beneficial? That's about as smart as speeding up the subway train because the tracks aren't finished. When will you learn, Keanu? <br />And the notion that the series contains deep philosophy in it is about as ridiculous as Daisy Fuentes starting her own clothing line. OK, the idea of living in a faade created by machines is about as far as the \\"philosophy\\" of these movies goes. Everything else is utterly lame, lame, lame. Especially the ideas of having different programs representedby people, and the fact that characters can die in the matrix. I think the movie uses the excuse that your mind makes it real. No... no, that actually makes no sense and is completely inconsistent with the other ridiculous rules in the movie. Just face it, the last two movies had about as much philosophy in them as Baby Geniuses 2. And critic and philosopher commentaries? In other words the Wachompski Bros got some of their friends together to record a commentary track. <br />But I can let all this slide, because I'm assuming the fan base of this film consists mostly of depressed teens who think techno is actual music. In one of the reviews I read, someone actually called these movies \\"smart.\\" Good lord, I hope for the sake of humanity that was an eleven year old who has never seen any other movie. Kiddo, Hitchcock is smart. Martin Scorseses and Akira Kurosawa are smart. The Wachawsky Bros are a couple of nerds that made one good movie at one point in their long, oily lives (the first Matrix.) <br />But don't let me discourage you from buying this. The more this sells, the more I am reminded that I can made garbage like this later in my career and there will always be thirteen-year-olds around to buy it up. <br />(And go ahead, thirteen-year-old, click the `No' button, I DARE you.)
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf, also known as Buddy, who is raised by elves, just discovered that he is not a elf, but a human. Now, it is up to him to go back to his 'own' world, New York. So he went into the adventure of finding his dad, which, doesn't know he exist. Throughout his first visit to New York city, he showed a lot of his 'weirdo-ness' he got hit by a car once! This movie goes on with hilarious lines and many fun actions, and ended in Buddy saving Christmas. This is a very \\"Chrismas-ty\\" comedy movie, and is so funny too! Better watch it on the holidays!
B000001EAQ|5.0|Bono and U2 now refer to Pop as the album they never finished.  After heading a massive two year tour and putting out Zooropa (while on tour) U2 disappeared to think it all up again and the rumors flew around that they were making a 'techno' record.  The album appeared right around the time 'electronica' (a nice, press-friendly, meaningless term) was supposed to be the 'next big thing'.  U2 'experimented'.<br /><br />Nonsense.  Zooropa is way more techno and experimental than Pop, which no one said at the time.  Pop didn't do the same business Achtung Baby did, the shows didn't sell like Zoo TV, and so now U2 regards this album as the one they rushed.  It's likely they'll drop this album from their upcoming tour playlists.<br /><br />Don't listen to them.  The album is excellent.  Forget the hype, it's been a while now.  There is no techno here, save for some squelching guitars, and a couple of electronic beats, or electronic-enhanced drumming from Larry.  Sure, Bono's voice is distorted some more (thankfully, they would stop this with the next album) and the cover art and disc look like 'techno'.  The album starts off hot with Discotheque, then keeps going with Do You Feel Loved and Mofo (the most techno-sounding thing here, but nothing outrageous) before settling down and getting heavier.  Thankfully, Miami and Playboy Mansion lighten the mood up and make perfect chill out tracks.  The ballads are serviceable, though they won't be replacing One.  The closer becomes a tiny bit embarassing, as Bono speaks to Jesus, but hey, we can let it slide.<br /><br />Highly recommended, like all U2 albums.  U2 didn't blow the world up with this album like they did Achtung Baby and then All That You Can't Leave Behind years later, but they created another solid record.  They just felt like walking out of a giant, spinning Lemon on tour every night at that stage in their careers.
B0006399FS|3.0|There are four GREAT U2 albums: War, Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby. Each of these is a distinct creation: recognizeably U2 but sonicly unique.  <br /> <br />Despite all the glowing reviews in the mainstream media, I don't think their latest release stands with these earlier recordings. It's a good album, with with Bono's trademark passion and the janglely guitar of the Edge, but ultimately it comes off like a lesser imitaion of their earlier work. While there are a couple inspired songs (Yahweh, Love and Peace or Else) there's nothing here of the stature of, say, any of the songs on Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby. How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sounds like it was created more by formula than real inspiration. (I still love you, U2, and you're still the best!)
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Ok, I don't really understand why someone would bother reviewing something they don't either :  A. LOVE  or  B. HATE. <br /> <br />Why review something you feel lukewarm about? (See Shawn Watson's review) <br /> <br />That said, YES, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" IS as kicka$$ a movie as you've heard!!   <br /> <br />I have seen it 3 times so far (at REGULAR price: $7.75) and I've never done that before (Not even for any of the Star Wars movies.) <br /> <br />And I have no idea where S. Watson(I'm not bashing you dude, just a difference of opinion) gets the idea that \\"Shaun...\\" is not a comedy.  ???   Have you ever heard of Dark comedy? Yes, there are touching, sad and/or gory moments but, most of all, I laughed my a$$ off! <br /> <br />I loved the movie so much, I ordered an \\"I Got Wood\\" shirt like the one Ed wears in the movie. (Hell,If I put a gap in my hair and started smoking, I'd BE Ed. LOL) <br /> <br />Anyway, I love this film! :)  I'm sure I'll see it at least a few more times in the theater and countless times on DVD.
B00003CXXP|5.0|The movie takes place several years into the future, where a multi billion dollar corporation is now investing in creating an artificial child for select parents whom are in need of one. The corporation decides to ask a young couple that has just suffered a tragedy of having their son in a coma, and they ask them to test out the prototype for them. The story follows a young android, David, throughout his many experiences with his new family, but his experience is suddenly abrupted by the return of the family's real child. When jealousy and sibling rivalry start to cause friction between the two siblings, the family decides to take David to the factory for dismantling. Along the way however, the mother is unable to go through with it and sets David loose. She tells him to run away and to never come back. Now, David is all alone and confused in post futuristic society where machines are persecuted by human beings. The story for this film is one the deepest and warmest stories ever, and Haley Joel Osment is brilliant in his performance as well. I do admit that the film's theme isn't consistent because it feels as though there are two directors doing this film. One moment you'll get a dark film (similar to Stanley Kubrick's style) when they do scenes like the robot killing festival, yet you'll recieve some light hearted touchy moments (Spielberg's style) with scenes like the uplifting ending. Overall, this film may seem a bit weird for some, but I highly recommend this one.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are great, but this is one of the funniest movies I've seen Will Ferrell in.  Zoolander is a hilarious movie <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Mmm, the circus is in town!\\"--Mugatu
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is two discs chocked full of absolute bliss. Rather than being a group project, this album is like the fab four starting a solo career of their own, and contributing all of their work into one album. The White Album has everything. Pop, Rock, Metal, Bluegrass, Country, Blues, and even Soft Rock. You can't be alive and not own this album. My favorite Beatles song \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" exists on this goldmine. It has a killer guitar solo given to the song by Eric Clapton. Oh, how awesome it is! This album is genuine! Even if you aren't a Beatles fan, or a fan of rock music, just give this a chance!
B00005M91K|5.0|I bought this when it first came out on video.  Some may marvel at the \\"technical\\" angle of the visual format, while others try to put the choreography in some sort of order.  I truly believe it is simply an \\"experience\\".  And it is different for everyone who watches it.  For me, it is a reflection of how we, as humans, live day-to-day--from around the globe.  It visually shows our splurges and excesses to desolation and disease.  It shows common human expressions from a global perspective.  I always walk away feeling humbled.  The way the music is blended in is incredible.  I actually bought this for my sister and father...to share the experience with them as well--they loved it.
B0002YLC24|5.0|It is not often that a sequel surpasses the original, especially when the original is as magnificent as Before Sunrise.  Before Sunset is one such sequel.  It expounds and improves upon the first movie in every way.  As its title subtley suggests, Before Sunset is more seasoned than its predecessor; as it should be.  Everyone involved is nine years older and wiser.  It shows in the writing, directing, and performances, particularly that of Julie Delpy who is just fantastic in this picture.   <br /> <br />I don't want to give a synopsis because I feel that even the smallest bit of information could spoil the fun.  Suffice it to say, our characters meet nine years later in Paris.  The ending is letter and picture perfect.   <br /> <br />Richard Linklater!  Make more movies!
B000007T1M|5.0|ok, kmez, dont bother insulting me here, thats reserved for toxicity. so shut up and go watch your DBZ while i review this.    Suite-Pea: 9/10 Tight intro, it kind of bashes Christianity though, but i dont care, cause im Jewish :P i think they were just screwing around with this one.    Know: 7/10 i really like the drums, but that's the only thing that stands out. unintelligable lyrics.    Sugar: 10/10 THE KOMBUCHA MUSHROOM PEOPLE! lol, as many other people has said, this song is totally unpredictable on the first listen, and it kinda grabs you into it in an inconspicuous kind of way. i really love this track.    Suggestions: 8/10 its ok. the high voice serj makes at the end cracks me and my buds up. something about ships attacking the coast O_o    Spiders: 9/10 Ah yes, the big, single-type song. i think that this is serj's most melodic vocal performance, with long note holdings and a beautiful solo in the middle.    Ddevil: 8/10 Too short to be a ten, very catchy though. Strong refrigerators?    Soil: 20/10 A heartfelt song about a friend who fell victim to suicide, with amazing lyrics and my favorite guitar solo fo all time. i'd give this album 5 stars just for this song.  My favorite on the album.    War?: 9/10 About the crusades, and how pointless war over religion is. I agree.    Mind: 15/10 My second favorite. It has an addictive stop-start layout, and its six minutes long. this is pretty sweet...mutually mentally molested. lol.    Peephole: 8/10 This is a heavy, circus-oriented song about how some people have a major dependance on drugs, and how bad it is for them.    CUBErt: 10/10 This is the only short song that i like on this album, about video games?    Darts: 9/10 Strange, strange, strange. The change of pitch makes for a funny song.    P.L.U.C.K.: 10/10 About the Armenian genocide by the Turks. the guitars are catchy, the drums are pimpin, and serj is...well, serj. thats the only way i can describe how his vocals are in this song.    125/130 overall....is an A! i'd say this is the best SOAD album, nice, raw, and downright amazing. thank you for reading!
B00004XONN|2.0|Rock music can be judged on two bases--style and songwriting(i.e substance).  \\"Kid A\\" features some of the worst songwriting in recent rock.  One star for \\"Idioteque,\\" the one good song in the entire album.  (Fortunately, the band crafted better tunes for \\"Hail to the Thief.\\") <br /> <br />Record label markets the band as leading the revolution in wedding electronica to rock music.  I beg different.  Stylistically, Radiohead is neither leading, nor the best in the sub-genre of techno rock.  To put is bluntly, they are not the first band mixing rock with techno...and they do not even do it well.  One more star for trying too hard, yet failing to impress.  <br /> <br />For techno rock done right, check out U2's 90s Euro-trilogy, or anything by NIN, or Massive Attack's \\"Mezzanine.\\"   <br /> <br />One more thing:  please do not compare Radiohead to Pink Floyd.  PF has this larger-than-life sound, that makes Radiohead seem like a sonic midget.
B00063MBU8|1.0|*sigh* here we go again, simple plan returns. i hate this band SO much. they combine a terrible, off-key singer with lousy riffs and 'oh my god, we split up' lyrics. i hate punk-pop in general, and this is a perfect reason why. this is the most terrible band on earth, theyre just a bunch of canucks looking for fame. well to you guys, *flicks them off* well, looks like we finally agree on something, karlmarxemilliozapata. good for you.
B000002MTU|5.0|I love blues. And there is nothin'. I mean nothin', better than \\"From the Cradle\\". Even B.B. King live.
B0000089GM|5.0|I got this disk from  friend of mine and at first I was sceptical about it,but after a few listenings i was hooked it,s a really good disk.I highly recommed it.
6304711891|5.0|This isn't really my kind of film, but I love San Francisco and lived there while the film was made. This film shows some great parts of the City. The penthouse at the Fairmount, the Palace of Fine Arts, great street scenes in North Beach. Almost as good as Heart Beat...
B0006399FS|5.0|I can hardly believe my ears.  Apparently hell froze over - but that is what Dante hinted at didn't he? <br />The secret and open core of this album is Achtung Baby.  One could say that U2 is using the work of the Nineties to restore the work of the Eighties.  Many have remarked on the return of sounds from the Joshua Tree and the Unforgettable Fire but I also hear Achtung Baby - in fact How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb would be utterly impossible without Achtung Baby - sonically and thematically. The song \\"A Man And A Woman\\" is the perfection of a kind of song the lads have been working on for over a decade - sweet pop, simple and sophisticated all at once. <br />I don't think it is a co-incidence that Bono's father died before the making of this album.  It took Bono all of the Eighties to grieve the loss of his mother and in those early albums I claim to hear the stages of grief.  We've returned to grief and what a disturbing but inspirational process it is. <br />U2 remains not only the greatest rock band in current times but also a contender for the top spot against bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.  I nominate U2 over the Beatles.  The Beatles were ever so slightly soul-less and the lads from Dublin have covered far more emotional territory than the lads from Liverpool.  Bono, as a lyricist, annihilates Lennon and McCartney.  But then, most lyricists do. <br />The great front men in rock remain Jim Morrison, Mick Jagger, Freddy Mercury, and yer man Bono.  He is an inspired blend of King David and Francis of Assisi whose charisma and authority grow over time and do not wane. <br />U2 is not, unfortunately, the most innovative band in the world but their sound and spirit remain utterly idiosyncratic and almost impossible to describe.  They are one of the few popular bands today who care about beauty - intense, haunting, divine. <br />When All That You Can't Leave Behind came out Rolling Stone magazine claimed falsely that that album was U2's third master piece alongside of the Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.  How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is the third masterpiece and so now we know that the end of the world is nigh.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|I enjoy the original and want to see what the difference in westerner's eyes is. John Clark (Richard Gere) happens to meet a goddess Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) in the middle of an almost perfect but boring marriage. And he joins a dancing course in order to see her.  <br /> <br />During the course he meets his bald-headed colleague Link Peterson (Stanley Tucci) and Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter). Link tries to hide his zeal in dance at his daytime job and wears a wig. Both Link and Bobbie were passionate in dance, but they don't see each other eye to eye. <br /> <br />John's stay out late draws the attention of his wife Beverly's (Susan Sarandon), and she employed detective to probe. Meanwhile Paulina asks John to quit dance if he just want to date her. John decides not to quit just to show that he likes the dance.  <br /> <br />Then there is a dance competition which Bobbie must partner with John and Link in order to win. This gives the chance for Bobbie and Link to fall in love. Although the detective can't find evidence of an affair of John, he asks Beverly to watch the competition... <br /> <br />This story gives a situation of torn between two lovers, a choice between a practical love and an ideal. The story can be different if the relation between John and Paulina had spiritual love, and more could be done by Beverly to win back her husband's heart. The romance between Bobbie and Link could also be contrast with John and Beverly. But I doesn't find these in this better casting film, and that could be a waste of talent. The speeches of the detective are also overdone. Indeed these are full of philosophies, but too much of them are rather distractive, even to those who have watched the original before. If the director has something to say, it's better done by the actors, and even conclude with speeches. On the other hand, there is something good for this film. For instance, the scene that John invites Beverly to dance is so lovely. <br /> <br />If your are looking for afilm with spectacular ballroom dance, or a film that is entertaining, this one is the right choice. I would give five stars for the original and this one I would give four stars.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Danielle is only a child when her father dies and leaves her with her new stepmother and two stepsisters.  Curious, intelligent, and sympathetic towards all people (peasants and princes alike), her \\"evil\\" stepmother forces her to act as their servant, sleeping in hay and doing chores.  Yet Danielle never grows bitter or angry.   <br /> <br />Her life is changed on the day a horse thief (Prince Henry) steals her father's horse.  Through a series of, it seems, coincidental meetings, Henry becomes intrigued and eventually falls in love with this strange young lady, who can swordfight, quote Thomas More, and throw with a good arm.   <br /> <br />Drew Barrymore is an excellent choice for playing Danielle and she truly portrays Danielle's innocence with believability.
B0002858YS|5.0|After looking at the current reviews of this CD, I thought I just had to chime in with my thoughts.   I listen to a range of music from Radiohead to Rush and lets face it, they shouldnt be mentioned in the same sentence as the formentioned just because this is only their debut album.  But I will say this, GET THIS CD!!!  It is amazing.  Its got great melodies, hooks and beats (even though some are a little cheesy) they just SOUND GOOD....Isnt that what music is all about???  The first single \\"Somebody told me\\" is just that....THE FIRST SINGLE.  There will be more of them to come.....\\"smile like you mean it\\", \\"midnight show\\", \\"jenny was a friend...\\" just to name a few.   <br /> <br />These guys from Vegas probably have some of sin city rubbing off on them on tracks like \\"Mr Brightside\\" and \\"On top\\" which are fast, hard hitting and energetic.....songs that make you want to drive up and down the \\"strip\\" with the top down and the radio crankin'.  Lead singer (Flowers) has an Oasis sounding voice as I almost thought they were from England after first listen and then further investigating I saw he was heavily influenced by Oasis.....lets just hope his band gets along better than the Gallagher brothers.  <br /> <br />Great CD to have in the collection....Believe me...its worth it!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is the fourth Megadeth album, and in my opinion the best, with their best lineup of Mustaine/Ellefson/Menza/Friedman.  Released in 1990, it is exemplary thrash/speed metal release with killer guitar riffs and songwriting by Dave Mustaine.   <br /> <br />\\"Holy wars...The Punishment Due\\":  10/10 <br />One of Megadeths most popular songs, and includes a great solo from Marty Friedman.  A great album opener as well. <br /> <br />\\"Hangar 18\\":  9/10 <br />Cheesy lyrics here, but this song presents some great lead tradeoffs and manic tempo changes.  This one would have worked out great as an instrumental. <br /> <br />\\"Take no Prisoners\\":  9/10 <br />This is one of the 3 songs from this reissue that features new vocals from Dave, most likely because he lost the original takes.  Still a killer song. <br /> <br />\\"Five Magics\\":  10/10 <br />New vocals are also featured here.  Again, great bass playing from David Ellefson and an awesome intro as well. <br /> <br />\\"Poison was the Cure\\":  10/10 <br />Starts off with a slower, melodic intro, then the song kicks into high gear with one of the fastest songs they've ever written.   <br /> <br />\\"Lucretia\\":  10/10 <br />Again new vocals are added with the remastered version (although I like these vocals a bit more).  Great riffs and a great melody.  One of my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Tornado of Souls\\":  10/10 <br />This one is a live favorite.  More great lead work my Marty Friedman and a very catchy chorus. <br /> <br />\\"Dawn Patrol\\":  9/10 <br />This track is merely filler material; a cool bass riff with spoken lyrics in a fake accent by Dave.  Still worth listening to at times, though. <br /> <br />\\"Rust in Peace...Polaris\\":  10/10 <br />A fast paced drum intro kicks off this faced paced rocker.  The unique riffage and strong vocals make this one of Megadeths most underrated songs. <br /> <br />87/90= ***** <br /> <br />***BONUS TRACKS*** <br />The bonus tracks on this reissue are quite good- 3 demos of the songs with Chris Poland (who played guitar on the first two albums) on guitar, and an unreleased track co-written by Nick Menza.  These are great additions to the album. <br /> <br />Overall, if you are a new fan, I highly suggest getting the original over this, even though it may be hard to find considering that it is out of print.  The sound is much better, but the new vocals take away from this already great album.  This reissue still deserves 5 stars in my opinion, because it is a classic metal album and the best megadeth album.
B0006399FS|4.0|After a few listens of this CD, you remember what made you first fall in love with U2 back in the early 80's.  They continue to evolve as great artist do.  From the early days of \\"Boy\\" to the haunting political sounds of \\"unforgettable fire\\" to the brash bombast of \\"ZOOROPA\\" & \\"POP\\" they continue to grow as musicians.  Lets face it these guys are older, wiser, more mature.  They are making tunes that they would enjoy listening to rather than try to capture a demographic suited for only Top 40 radio.  Yes there are some obvious \\"hits\\" on here namely \\"vertigo\\", \\"a man and a woman\\" and \\"crumbs from your table\\" yet there are some well crafted gems that a true fan of music would appreciate.  This is a High-End, upscale CD for a more discerning audience.....sorry for those of you that thought you would get another \\"Achtung Baby\\".  It just shows us the vast diversity of U2. And it makes us appreciate \\"Achtung\\" for what it was.....a snapshot of the band back in 1991.....they have grown as most bands should 13 years later.
B0002XVSRE|5.0|Any U2 fan worth his or her salt MUST get this version for the inclusion of \\"Fast Cars,\\" which is simply the greatest U2 song ever, ever better then \\"One,\\" \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" or \\"I Threw a Brick Through a Window.\\" It is also the perfect ending to the magical experience that is listening to How to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. This song puts Bono and co. in the ranks of messers Bach, Mozart, and L/M (that's Lennon/McCartney!) So what if you have to pay a little bit extra! The hours of enjoyment you'll get from playing Fast Cars over and over will pay for itself after the first week Listen to me...GET THIS IMPORT DO NOT GET THE AMERICAN VERSION!!! THAT MEANS YOU FOOL!!!
B0002IU988|5.0|2004, in my opinion, it has been a sour year in terms of new rock music. I always appreciate the older rock, but new rock is something I definitely prefer. This year I've fallen for the likes of Velvet Revolver, Collective Soul, Lo Pro, and Jimmy Eat World, but I must say \\"One Day Reamins\\" rises above them all. There is very little Creed influence, as Alter Bridge is a completely different animal. My personal favorites are tracks 1,2,4,8,9,10. If you're looking for a solid rock CD, make Alter Bridge your choice this holiday season. You won't regret it. I personally can't wait till another one of their CDs comes out.
B00005U11Z|5.0|that review was terrible, becuase its the same from so many biased perry fans, first off this is schon's band he formed it in 1973, perry came aboard in 1977, yes he is one of my all time favorite singers, but his ego ruined the band in 1985 firing original bassist ross valory, and the monstorous fusion drummer steve smith what was he thinking as if a band revolves all around the singer i'm here to stick up for the musicians plus cain and shon co wrote all most all of the major big 80's hits with perry, as good as perry was in the band in 1987, he put journey on a hiatus, that lasted until 1996, then his hip is injured, then he tries to play controller again, gets booted out of the band, and something better chemistry wise happens schon hires steve augeri, an excellent vocalist in his own right with a beautiful voice that is very like steve perry's schon knew about augeri since his days in bad english( a very good band also)and said he would hire him if perry did not want to get back with journey, then the other newer man neals good buddy dean castonovo, who played in bad english, and hardline with him on drums, an excellent drummer, who's hero was the man he replaced after smith said unless it was with perry he wouldn't be in the band, so chemistry is important and journey is truly back to the great times, so reminiscent of early journey, as well as 80's journey because they will be only doing 2-3 balleds per record now, on there ep red 13 there is only one balled its called walking away from the edge, its fantastic, much like open arms, and faithfully, the new journey is full of energy I have seen them three times in detroit recently, this dvd is great for fans new, and old, journeys new studio album will be out in early 2005 I belive, buy this dvd, be unbiased see the chemistry no band needs egotistical singers or musicians ruining the band, I'm glad the journey is back, and I am going to ride this one forever. i wish perrys voice would heal, and he would do somesolo stuff but that probably is wishful thinking, I enjoy his music solo, but his ego and attitude hurt journey, and its better for the band without him, lousy radio wouldn't play journey with perry, american music is a sexual image, its focused on the young, and its politics are why its hurting caring more about looks, than talent, and great musicianship, keyboard programming, and drum programming is lousy, and will never replace live musicians, because the underground scene will always be a jackpot for the open minded, and musically diverse
B00000JMQE|4.0|This movie was one of the first i ever saw that really opened my eyes right off the bat and it never stopped. I guess i led a sheltered life, never being allowed to watch \\"scary\\" things, and i guess my parents figured a sequel to wizard of oz would be good for us, but it scared the dickens out of me, but in a really good way. The electro shock, the storm, the wheelers, the headless witch, and the incredibly imaginative, lunch pail trees, the waddling tock, the green room, this is a gem of a movie. seeing this movie will re awaken your childhood imagination.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I too was at the Sunday show in Dallas. I agree with others that Jeff Beck was brilliant. His one song set was flawless and wowed the crowd - he got a huge ovation. It is a terrible shame that he did not make the disc. But, I would encourage perople to buy the set - there is a lot there to love. Thanks to Eric! -  BTW, Eric was a gracious host to the other players as always. He is always willing to help others sound at their best and not get in the way.
B00068IOWM|4.0|For those interested in buying any of the editions of HTDAAB, I would ask you give the album some time and don't just listen to it once.  It's definitely a grower.  Every time I listen to it, there are more nuances and parts of songs that I like more.   <br /> <br />I think that there are a good number of songs on this album that are strong for various reasons.  Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own is one of the best songs on this album...not as good as One from Achtung Baby, but it is packed with true emotion that just gets your attention.  Love and Peace or Else is a very funky song, with almost a gospel bent to it at times.  Vertigo and Fast Cars are both fun songs that you can listen to over and over and still rock out to...I like the flamenco-guitar song that Edge has done in Fast Cars esp.   <br /> <br />A Man and A Woman is probably my least favorite song, just because of the structure of the song...in some ways it seems a bit trite, but the lyrics are still very good. <br />Overall, there are some places where Bono seems a bit out of tune, but in the whole context of the particular song, it's not blatant, and if you know the history of many of these songs, like One Step Closer, this merely adds to the whole effect. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album, and for those who are still wary, get the standard edition and hope that a friend has a copy of Fast Cars. =) <br /> <br />
B000002KET|5.0|This one is my favorite, by far. Volume 4 has Wheels of Confusion, which is great. BUT. This album has National Acrobat, and my absolute favorite Sabbath Song, Spiral Architect. In my opinion, this is the best song they ever wrote, but Im sure there will be rabid disagreement! LOL Ilike the songs that never really became 'hits'. If I ever heard National Acrobat, Spiral Architect or Wheels of Confusion on the radio monkeys might fly out of my [...]. And if you saw Bruce Almighty, you know what Im talking about![...]
B00013PHGS|5.0|Great CD. Great band. Gotta have it. We never get tired of this music that will draw you in.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is an extraordinary piece of metal history from Metallica. Each song on this CD is quality music. <br />1. Blackened - 9/10. Fast tempo. Great lyrics. <br />2. And Justice For All - 10/10. Great intro. Excellent guitaring by Hammett and Hetfield. <br />3. Eye of the Beholder - 9/10. Nice song. Drumming is great. <br />4. One - 10/10. One of the best on the CD. A classic Metallica masterpiece. <br />5. The Shortest Straw - 10/10. Amazing lyrics. Fast tempo. Hetfield is the best lyric writer in history. <br />6. Harvester of Sorrow - 9/10. Heavy song. Slower than most songs, but still a great song. <br />7. The Frayed Ends of Sanity - 10/10. Great riffs. Great lyrics. <br />8. To Live is to Die - 10/10. My favorite Metallica song. Beautiful intro. Amazing riffs. It is an overall masterpiece from Metallica.  <br />9. Dyers Eve - 10/10. Fastest song on the CD. Amazing drumming by Ulrich. Nice riffs.
B0002OERI0|2.0|This is definitley Green Days worst album, they sound rather polished and maufactures on thi labum as well. <br />Green Day started going down hill with Warning. <br /> <br />This is'nt the Punk Rock sound of \\"dookie\\" or \\"Insomniac\\".
0743424425|5.0|The book was slow at first, but it gets better. And it went pretty smoothly for me for a little while. Then I hit a reading rut and I put the book down for a little while. Ok, I gotta get this out. Kubrick's version of the novel was really good. But it wasn't scary. I like his ending and interpretation better, but it wasn't scary. The mini series one WAS scary. It made me jump a couple times and it ACTUALLY had me on the edge of my seat. And that doesn't happen much.  So, I suggest reading the book first, then the Kubrick, then the mini series. Thats the way I did it and it all worked out good. Save the best for last, even though Kubrick had the better ending. But don't listen to the people who say that the book was scary, because it wasn't. It didn't really have suspense, besides the lawn animals. That's pretty much it. But the read was good with the odd boring part throughout the book. Creative story.
B00018D44U|3.0|Nora Jones, in here debut album just about knocked my sox off. Her rendidtions of old standards and a lot of the new material in the first effort were innovative and pleasing. The \\"generically country\\" Lone Star is a musically sweet and lyrically poetic number that no one else around today has paralelled. In the Feels Like Home album she has departed from all of the characteristics that made the first album so interesting and exhillarating. It would have been better for Nora's following if she had done at least a couple of albums based on the standards she set with the first production before exerting her independence in new areas, which seems to be what she has done with Feels Like Home. Diana Krall has become her own principal song writer in her latest Girl In The Other Room, but at least she gave us a half dozen albums of what brought her to our attention in the first place.

B0002XVQNU|4.0|A marked improvement over the previous version of the film, \\"Daredevil\\" (Director's Cut) allows director and co-writer Mark Steven Johnson to adjust his film to the darker aspects he originally wanted to portray on screen. I won't be reviewing the previous edition in this review at all (since amazon.com inadvertently combines all editions into one pool this may end up under the previous theatrical DVD release), but will focus on what makes the \\"Director's Cut\\" unique and worth picking up for fans of the movie and the comic book.<br /><br />Sometimes \\"Director's Cuts\\" are a mere attempt by the studio to make more money or the director to create something successful out of a disaster. That isn't the case with \\"Daredevil\\"(Director's Cut). Director Johnson originally intended to focus as much on Daredevil as he did on Matt Murdock and his career as a crusading lawyer fighting for the underdogs. The 30 minutes of additional footage adds an important subplot about the murder of a hooker which is pinned on street thug (Coolio). The fight sequence at the end between Kingpin and Daredevil is longer and more involved. Many of the fight sequences are cut with an \\"R\\" rating movie in mind (and that's what this DVD version received as its rating). Some of the love story between Elektra and Daredevil gets shortened here as well in favor of developing Murdock's character and for some truly interesting (and occasionally funny) courtroom scenes.<br /><br />Johnson was required by his contract to provide a PG-13 movie and, as a result, he had to reshuffle the movie a bit cutting out much of the subplot as well as trimming down the more intense fight sequences of the film. There's also a number scenes related to character development that got lost along the way most notably the reporter that follows the Daredevil and Murdock himself. Restoring these sequences improve the film and add strength to a narrative that had a number of holes in it and was too simply resolved. Additionally, it gives more substance to Matt Murdock's character creating a much more complex person. We also see much more about Kingpin and scenes that demonstrate how dangerous he can be.<br /><br />The transfer here actually looks a bit sharper and with slightly better clarity the the original DVD. Like the previous edition, this one has been transferred in the anamorphic widescreen format which translates to better image quality than a standard widescreen transfer. The sound is also top notch with nice use of the surround sound format.<br /><br />This \\"Director's Cut\\" doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the previous edition (in fact it is a single disc release). The only extras are Johnson and producer Avi Arad's commentary track for this edition (which was in preparation for DVD before the movie was even released to theaters) and a 15 minute featurette on the director's intension in creating this edition. While it lacks the extras on the previous edition, it more than makes up for them with a stronger film. My only complaint is that this should have been released at the same time as the original DVD and/or in place of it with a second disc of extras. Unfortunately, Fox has participated in the old double dip.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Daredevil\\" is much improved with this special edition. It's a pity it came out so long after the original (much like the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies). Johnson points out in the featurette that he considers \\"Daredevil\\" to still be flawed movie and while he may be right, restoring the first R rated version certainly makes this film stronger. The \\"Director's Cut\\" is far closer to Frank Miller's comic book vision of \\"Daredevil\\" than the previous edition. Fans of the movie will definitely want to pick this up.stance to Matt Murdock's character creating a much more complex person.

B0006284JQ|4.0|There's no denying the cultural phenom that Britney was for a period of 5 years, from early 1999 through 2003. With her future in doubt (no touring in 2004, disastrous quickie Las Vegas wedding-cum-annulation, followed by the eyebrow-raising wedding to one of her dancers), this collection comes in the nick of time.<br /><br />\\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" (2CDs, 85 min.) starts with the greatest hits on CD1 (17 tracks, 60 min.). While there is little to argue about the songs themselves, there are 2 things that bother me. First, the collection would be a much better listen had the songs been arranged chronologically. For example, going from \\"Everytime\\" to \\"...Baby One More Time\\" is simply disorrienting. Second, some of the songs come in a remixed version. For example, the original \\"Overprotected\\" is a terrific song but it shows up here in a different version altogether. CD2 (5 tracks, 25 min.) brings more of those remixes, and they present well-known songs in an almost unrecognizable version. It's not really my cup of tea, although \\"Breathe On Me\\" is admittedly pretty good, imagine a Donna Summer-like sound of \\"I Feel Love\\". The 3 new songs are not bad, although the \\"My Prerogative\\" Bobby Brown cover doesn't come close to the original.<br /><br />I personally have serious doubts about Britney's future as a power in the music business whenever she decides to end her current hiatus. Meanwhile, this \\"Greatest Hits\\" set is adequate. It could've been better, but there are a lot of great songs here, there's no denying that.
B0006284JQ|4.0|britney's new album is okay. i absolutely love her songs \\"Outrageous\\" and previously unreleased \\"(I've Just Begun) Having My Fun\\". The album cover could be better. The picture is from 2003! BAD BRITNEY! but overall the c.d. is okay I give it 3.5 stars rounding off to 4 stars.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2's best effort since Achtung Baby. For context, I'm a fan for 20 years, favorite albums being <br />1) Joshua Tree <br />2) Achtung Baby <br />3) Unforgettable Fire <br />4) October <br />I thought All You Can't Leave Behind sounded forced, soul-less and overproduced.  <br /> <br />At first listen to the latest effort, I shrugged & said \\"U2's gone so soft & commercial, no memorable songs whatsoever. Now after about 30 listens, I think it's right there with the best. <br /> <br />It's a definite grower that takes a few listens. Edge's guitar has flat-out never been better. The short solo in All Because Of You is the hardest I've ever heard him rock, almost AC/DC-ish. His guitar is brilliant, haunting in just about every track. <br /> <br />Just about every song on this album is strong. Anyone who says they're playing it conservative hasn't given it enough listens. Vertigo is by far the weakest song on the album. This is the most soulful U2 have sounded since The Joshua Tree. I would say it's most like a cross between The Unforgettable Fire and Achtung Baby, with a lot of The Joshua Tree mixed in too. It's truly harkens back to the U2 of the mid-80's, with a sound that's a bit more evolved. <br /> <br />It's probably sacrilege to say, but this album is stronger overall than The Joshua Tree. I don't think it's nearly as brilliant, but consistently stronger overall. It has, at most, 2 filler songs, whereas I thought The Joshua Tree had a couple more. <br /> <br />Give this a few listens, see if it doesn't get exponentially stronger with each listen.
B0006284JQ|5.0|If you don't you want this because you own ALL of her recent CDs. you're wrong, because it has 2 songs that were never realeased (well..actually 3, including: \\"my prerogative\\"). I would really recommend this CD and it comes with a bonus CD!!!! I thought that the order will be different, but that is alright. I really enjoy this and i can listen to it all day, and I do... Buy the CD and enjoy the \\"outrageous\\"-ly good fun, because like she said, \\"I've just begun (having my fun)\\".
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|People who say this movie stunk shouldn't be allowed into a movie theater. This movie really delivers the main points in the Illiad. Of course it may lack a few things here and there, but almost all movies based on books do. And for those of you who dont think Brad Pitt did a good job as the war hero, i would like to see you find someone better. Pitt did an excellant job as Achillies. Overall this movie was great... <br />
B00005A46U|5.0|Since its first appearance in 1970 this album was acclaimed by critics (Melody Maker, Sept. 1970) as one of most singular albums of the year. At that time the rock scene was changing faster and faster. New bands grow up like mushrooms, but in spite oh that, very few of them produced a really original sound. <br />Surely Caravan were one of them and this album represents a very good example, their best I think, of their unique style that has survived with great honour to the severe judgements of time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|4.0|I am not going to touch much on the merits of the movie in this review.  You either like the \\"new\\" look of Hogwarts, or you don't.  You either are unhappy at Harry not being quite the central character he is in the first two movies, or you see this as a much more ensemble piece.  You either accept the new Dumbledore, or you don't.<br /><br />I personally had to warm up to the changes. The first time I saw the movie in theaters, I left unhappy at the myriad changes.  I've softened to those changes, and I realize change is good.  Stasis, keeping things rigid, is a sin.<br /><br />Anyway, the problem with this DVD is not in the movie, but in the DVD itself.  My Apex DVD player refuses to play the second disc,where the special features are located.  I returned my copy for a second copy, only for it to fail as well.<br /><br />My copy, however, works perfectly in a friend's DVD player (and they have a completely different brand of DVD player).  Thus, there is something in the encoding that my DVD player dislikes intensely.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor--buyer beware.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie takes the Harry Potter series to new heights with a fresh interpretation. The Prisoner of Azkaban Hits the mark entirely. <br /> <br />Alfonso Cuaron has helped the Harry Potter series mature just as J.K. Rowling's characters have in the book series. He also made Prisoner slightly different from the book. It was mildly disappointing to see that the first two films followed the books in every detail. It is unfortunate that Curaon will not return for Goblet of Fire. Perhaps they can lure him back for Order of the Phoenix, which would benefit from his darker, more gothic interpretation of Hogwarts.
B00001QEE7|5.0|I was just a kid when this movie first came to video, and I have fond memories of watching it every day with one of my cousins for about a month. Because of the good memories, I bought the DVD recently. I was not disappointed. The music is well-written and enhances the action while adding a Carribbean flavor. The animation is classic Disney hand-drawn, before the days of computers, but still very well-done and very realistic.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I really love Kill Bill, <br />A groundbreaking and kinda unique movie! <br /> <br />And Those music/songs play in Movie is Bright too! <br />Plus The Music is worked by RZA[A rapper/produce from a Rap Group called Wu Tang Clan] <br />This Guy is one of my favorite Rap Music Producer! <br />So, there's have no reason for me to not purchase it! <br /> <br />I Still remember I have bought A.I.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child and being absolutely terrified of some of the characters.  This film incoporates some features of Baum's Oz that were lost in the original version, such as the Deadly Desert (which still gives me nightmares), and the fact that ALL Ozian animals can talk (except Toto, and no one knows why).  Although Ozma comes into the world of Oz VERY differently in the book series, this film introduces the lovable TikTok and Gump, as well as a Scarecrow who is FAR more loyal to Baum's depiction and the illustrations in his books. <br /> <br />I've watched this on tape so many times that it broke, and if there's any way to wear out a DVD (besides scratching it), I'll probably do that, too!  Absolutely fabulous, and a must for all fans of the original Wizard.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Bush sure does provide a lot of material.  Both hysterical and insane.  Seeing this film is an eyeopener.  It did a lot for many Americans who wanted answers.   But, bush \\"won\\" \\"again\\", basically due to the fact the republican party had no other choice.  Bush is not and never was my President.  If they ever prove that he is, I will bite the bullet and call him as such.   <br /> <br />Go Mr. Moore!  You rock!
B00005B4GU|4.0|As Radiohead albums are ranked, Amnesiac more often than not ends up at the bottom. It is also made out to be some sort of 'Kid B'. Both of these statements are, in my opinion, undeserved and false.    Amnesiac has on the whole a very different feel than Kid A. For starters,it is pervaded by a different atmosphere. Most people might not know what I'm talking about by this statement so I'll clarify. Guitars are largely absent on this album, but that doesn't necessarily mean that 'Amnesiac' falls into the same category as 'Kid A'. In fact, the electronics have been mostly replaced by classical instrumentation. There are a few guitar tunes such as 'I Might Be Wrong' and 'Knives Out'.  The whole record has a very surreal atmosphere. All the songs seem to take place in a world very like ours, but different and darker. Neither 'Kid A' nor 'Amnesiac' are nearly as despondent as 'The Bends' or 'OK Computer'. But whereas 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer' seemed to be set in our world, this time Thom and the gang don't seem to be out to tell a story. All the tracks are less cohesive, and seem to be seperate little entities of their own, set in another, more eerie universe.    And yet despite this, 'Amnesiac' is more abstract than Kid A. Listening to this album is similar to appreciating a Cubist work: it needs to be heard again and again to appreciate its beauty and its little subtleties. While 'Kid A's heavy reliance on electronics is the main reason for its opacity, on 'Amnesiac' even basic song structures are shattered and glued back together again in an unusual manner. Often the songs don't seem to have any particular direction, or take unexpected turns. If you are like me and do not pay much attention to structures, it won't bother you much. But I can understand that for other people this album may be hard to grasp on the first listen.    Now for a track-by-track review of the album.    Packt Like Sardines In a Crushed Tin Box - An electronic  number. The lyrics are sparse,with Thom repeating \\"I'm a reasonable man, get off my case\\" again and again. The sound seems to consist of clanging metal boxes. It is enjoyable, but not one of the best.    Pyramid Song - Words cannot describe how gorgeous this song is. There are no guitars. It is really Thom singing accompanied by lush strings, piano and drums. The chord progressions might not appeal to everyone. They are certainly unpredictable, and sound as though a pitch tuner on a keyboard was used. The beat is very irregular. Check the video, it is a perfect match. A magnificent and etheareal song. This is one of Radiohead's best and most underrated songs.    Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors - Another one influenced by IDM, although here it merely sounds amateurish. A bad attempt, I should say. Not a traditional song, but just a noise similar to the revolving of doors(how surprising...) and an alien voice mumbling nonsense about different kinds of doors. It sounds mostly like an attempt to sound deep and inaccessible, but comes off sounding pretentious instead. All  in all amusing for a couple of listens, but the song irritates soon. I always skip it.    You And Whose Army? - The subject of this song is reportedly Tony Blair. The first half of the song sounds like it was broadcast from an old '40s radio. In fact, the whole song feels as though it was written 60 years ago. The beginning is just Thom singing, accompanied by an Ondes Martenot. Then the orchestra is introduced for a grand finale.    I Might Be Wrong - A more 'traditional' song by Radiohead. It is quite similar to 'This Mess We're In', Thom's duet with PJ Harvey. The only Radiohead number, I should say, which has a somewhat sexy feel to it.    Knives Out - Another traditional one. The lyrics are surprisingly violent for Radiohead. There's not much else to say about this one...it is just a good song.    Morning Bell/Amnesiac - This is a reworking of 'Morning Bell' from 'Kid A'. A lot of people have complained that it is merely filler, which in my opinion is rather unfounded. It is not merely the notes and the lyrics that create a song but also the arrangement. This version literally has more bells and it seems less trip-hoppy than the version on Kid A. Definitely a different song.    Dollars & Cents - Aside from a barely-there lead guitar 'Dollars & Cents' is awash in strings, and with Thom's voice almost blending with the violins, this is certainly one of the more interesting experiments on this album. Unlike on 'Pyramid Song', though, the strings are not warm and enveloping but icy, and Thom sings in an especially high range as he rants about capitalism. The echoing cymbals only add to the gloom. The music doesn't seem to go into any particular direction, and there are no clear cut choruses and verses.    Hunting Bears - Unlike 'Treefingers' on Kid A, the music is completely incongruent with the title. It is essentially the sound of guitars cut and pasted together again. What results has a vaguely oriental feel, and sounds a bit like a sitar, but I've never paid long enough attention to describe it further.    Like Spinning Plates - My  favorite. The background consists of strings or an organ, I can't decide which, recorded backwards. Thom has sung his lyrics backwards, and the tape was reversed forwards, so now he is singing the right lyrics. Can you follow? The effect is that Thom's singing is now very slurred. This song is in a similar vein as 'You And Whose Army?'.    Life In a Glass House - A slice of New Orleans jazz. Don't listen to those who claim that it is pretentious. The musical knowledge of these people doesn't extend beyond the Sixties. The lyrics highlight the more unpleasant side of fame.    Be warned, the lyrics on 'Amnesiac' are sparse and simple. There are no complex metaphors such as on 'OK Computer'. The lyrics sound even more garbled than usual, and better understanding of the album is not aided by the fact that the booklet contains no lyrics.    All in all, I'm not sure whether 'Amnesiac' is really less accessible than for instance 'OK Computer'. I guess for someone exposed to music beyond the usual rock it will not seem as difficult to approach than for someone who is not. But really, 'Amnesiac' isn't as bad as it is made out to be. In fact, it is better than Kid A, which is actually less accessible. And I've also grown to appreciate this album because it has helped me through some difficult times.  So judge for yourself.
1594200106|1.0|Believe it or not but I am shooting for an objective review here :-)<br /><br />But the subjective part first: I wasted money on this book because of the many<br /><br />positive reviews it has earned, the cool cover, and the utterly misleading<br /><br />comparisons to Borges, Eco, etc. Just because the book copies a labyrinthine<br /><br />library concept from Borges doesn't make the book worthy of the least talented<br /><br />disciple of Borges'. Early into the book I found myself struggling with the<br /><br />author and losing the battle: he has been successfully undermining my best<br /><br />intentions in finding another literary adventure in this volume.

B00062J00S|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, watch it and put yourself in George Bailey's situation. This movie is a great way to look at your own life and judge what have YOU contributed to society.  I have watched this movie dozens of times over the years and a video copy was given to me as a present from a very good friend of mine.  Anytime I start to feel sorry for myself or think I got a bad turn, think of what the world may be without you, all the people you may have given directions to, helped someone cross a street, gave to a charity (if you never did this things than there is no sense to the movie).  Each movie does not have to be a Cecil B DeMille do be worth something, hopefully by watching this movie you will look at your life in a different way.  There are several worthwhile messages in the movie and it is a good way to spend an evening with your family/children. Everyone can't be monetarily rich but when you have many friends for many years you are truly richest man in town.
B00005JN7O|3.0|The only original point about 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' is that: A) the entire film was made with CGIs, the cast being shot against the blue screen; so Empire State Building you see is just a trick of modern technology. <br /> <br />And B) the film is virtually nothing but a homage to countless old films -- 'Metropolis,' 'The Third Man,' and many many others.  You may be absolutely enthralled, seeing the old-fashioned visuals refined and remodeled to the modern taste, or just unimpressed.  Sorry, but I belong to the latter category. <br /> <br />The plot is silm (the film is basically an extention of 6 minute film the director made privately on his PC) -- so silm that in the second half it makes little sense.  It's about Sky Captain, intrepid pilot of fighter plane between the two world wars, and a newsreporter Polly Perkins, who seeks for the juicy story holding a camera.  They are involved with an international plot by one German scientist, and they come to know it soon after the city is under attack by many robots (ala 'The War of the World').   <br /> <br />Captain is played by Jude Law, Polly by Gwyneth Paltrow.  They look great on screen, like the stars of the 30s Hollywood, but don't expect any emotions, or chemstry, between them.  The film suggests they were formerly in love with each other, and will be again, but the lack of romantic feeling between the thin characters cannot be disguised.  And as supports, Giovanni Ribisi, Michael Gambon, Bai Ling (totally unrecognizable), and Angelina Jolie appear, but Ms. Jolie's role is just an extended cameo, just in case. <br /> <br />In spite of interesting visuals, good costumes (by Stella McCartney, Paul's daughter), and rousing music, 'Sky Captain' remains the well-made sample of the director's flair for visuals.  The visuals themselves are good, I assure you, but the novelty soon wears off, and Kerry Conran still has many things to learn especially when it comes to inducing the actors to give theirbest shot.  In some scenes, the actors (Ms. Paltrow in particular) stares at somewhere in the air blankly, as if looking at nothing (of course, they are watching nothing in reality).   <br /> <br />Can he handle the humans as well as visuals?  Next time he will be tested, and until then, 'Sky Captain' remains a very good demo tape by a very promising director.
B000000OSG|5.0|This is GNR's most powerful CD...no its not the hardest...It's the most emotional and most complete... In exception with the 3 fillers (Shotgun Blues, Get in the Rin, My World) all the songs are crafted with detailed perfection. This CD clearly shows some great songwriting packed with powerful and beautiful guitar solos.  Listen to songs like \\"Estranged\\" \\"Civil War\\" and you would know what I mean.  It's another side of Guns n' Roses that you thought you would never see.  These songs will get to you and make you listen to them over and over again.  It's one of those CDs that gets better with every listen.  If you want to buy the hard-rockers buy \\"Appetite of Destruction\\" but if you want to hear something where you can really appreciate the music than buy this CD.  It is GNR's most beautiful work.
B00002ND77|5.0|Malcolm Little, a.k.a. Red, was not a man I would have wanted to be seen hanging around with. I wouldn't even have wanted to cross paths with him. But what happened to him later on in his life and the change that he underwent is one of the most influential and inspiring true stories that have ever touched my heart. When Malcolm accepted Islam, even though he entered this great religion from a wrong and very misleading angle, it was the beginning of a legendary figure's emergence into the American conscience and a beacon for all that stood up to the oppression and injustice that America was doing to its own people. This legendary person's name was Malcolm X, or Hajj Malek Shabbaz, may God bless him. <br /> <br />Spike Lee, the director of Do The Right Thing, brings Malcolm X to the big screen with Denzel Washington portraying the late Black leader. The movie takes you through Malcolm's turbulent childhood, his upbringing into a young con man, drug abuser, and gang leader. It was his 6 or so years spent in jail where Malcolm was introduced to the rising Nation of Islam lead by Elijah Muhammed from one of his inmates. Malcolm educated himself in jail and turned out to be what many never expected; an outspoken, strong and very intelligent spokesperson for the Nation and the struggles of the black community across America. The movie successfully reveals the inner conflicts between Malcolm and the Nation, and the result of Malcolm breaking away to become an independant activist. The film also does Malcolm's story justice by showing his pilgrimage to Mecca - pilgrimage is known as Hajj in Arabic and is considered the fifth and final pillar of Islam. It was this special visit to Mecca where Malcolm was exposed to mainstream Islam - the true picture of Islam unlike the misleading teachings of Elijah Muhammed and the Nation of Islam. The movie ends with the disturbing assassination of Malcolm and a piece narrated by Ossie Davis featuring pictures of the real Malcolm X and a scene with Nelson Mandela giving his thoughts on Malcolm. <br /> <br />The movie is based on the bestselling book 'Autobiography of Malcolm X' by Malcolm X himself as told to Alex Haley.  <br /> <br />I do recommend reading this book to get a wider picture of Malcolm's life and realization of mainstream Islam. <br /> <br />One of the best movies I have seen.  <br /> <br />A

B0006399FS|3.0|At this point U2 is above my criticisms, even as a die-hard fanatic and contributor to their much-deserved success and \\"legendary\\" status. However, I found their latest album to be their weakest since before they found their trademark sound in 1984 with \\"The Unforgettable Fire.\\" I was not a huge fan of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" either, I should add, and it's quite simply more of the same. The passion and drive of \\"Joshua Tree\\" are missing here, and so too is the experimental grace of \\"Achtung, Baby!\\" Tough acts to follow, granted, but the \\"new\\" U2 contents itself with being good instead of great. Many of the tracks here are interchangable, complete with less potent lyrics and few hooks that grab, with few exceptions. Also, Bono's once subtle prose has been replaced by a blatant preachy style that screams \\"Love and Peace or Else.\\" Nothing wrong with the message, and the song is semi-catchy, but the elegance is gone. On the whole, the band that once mocked itself so gleefully in the 90s has again turned to more serious fare, but in that process misplaced its overriding passion. If this is the fourth phase of U2, I can only hope that in the fifth they return to what makes them legends. Still, even at their lowest ebb they can produce a few great songs along with a few boring yawns, but it's hard to praise them for that when they're one of the greatest rock 'n roll bands of all time, and you know they are capable of more.
B0006399FS|5.0|From the raw energy of \\"Vertigo\\" to the plaintive spiritual cries of \\"Yahweh,\\" U2 makes it clear that they have no plans of relinquishing the rock and roll throne.  This time, though, there fight seems less self-conscious than it has in a while.<br /><br />Ironically, and appropriately, titled \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,\\" this disc seems to make a case for the value of the heart and relationships over politics and diatribe.  While never selling out to shallow pop slogans, these songs are full of emotion.  Bono sings of his deceased father, of his concern for those dying of AIDS, of his desire for connection with his maker.<br /><br />In another band's hands, these themes might sound trite (as they have once or twice in U2's hands), but this time around they get it all right.  The production is stellar, yet it has an edge to it, a live quality.  The lyrics are deep, but imminently singable.  And the melodies are as haunting as they are unforgettable.  With only one or two mediocre songs, this is an album by which U2 once again sets the standard for themselves.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Buy this DVD now!  You will not be disappointed!  This is an absolutely supreme collection of Zeppelin at their finest!  I grew up in the era of Zeppelin and to this day consider them along with the Beatles..one of the greatest rock bands to rule the earth!  Their music is timeless and new generations are discovering how great of a band they were..Page is a true musician..his many years of honing his craft as a studio musician paid off when he formed this band..was he truly lucky when Plant and Bonzo joined the band..and adding John Paul Jones..a well known musician in his own right and you had the makings of a legendary band!  My favorites on this DVD set are the acoustic numbers..Bron-Y-Aur, That's the Way..etc. and the electric bluesy numbers..the incredible I Can't Quit You Babe..Page and the classic Les Paul standard..a match made in heaven!  I can see where Slash got his inspiration..he even emulated Pages's hair over the face posturing...Page was the original guitar god!! Great stuff!
0679731725|5.0|Having been disappointed by Ishiguro's \\"When We Were Orphans\\", I was hesitant to pick up \\"Remains...\\", but I loved the movie, and was curious how the book had inspired such a great film. I was more than surprised at how quickly I was immersed in the writing, which is incredibly measured and truly lovely. Where the movie focused more on the unrequited love between Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton, the book explores the definition of living a life of \\"dignity\\", and what defines that type of life. Stevens is a much more sympathetic character here, because of his flaws and misconceptions of how he thinks dignity is attained, and ultimately he lives a quietly tragic life. It is this contrast between perception and reality that makes this story so rich and readable.
079073804X|3.0|This movie isnt scary at all. not even a little . whats the point the devil goes inside a girl so. This move has no jumps not terror. I mean this isnt really a horror movie its more like drama. but i have to say is was a good movie . But not scary at all
B0002858YS|5.0|Despite many people writing The Killers off as a one hit wonder because of their popular song Somebody Told Me, they are, I believe, a musical force to be reckoned with. Though Somebody Told Me is as catchy a pop tune as the next, the rest of this album delves deeper and brings to mind Interpol and The Rapture. If you've got the money to spend and are in for a good CD all the way through, The Killers Hot Fuss is right up your alley, baby. &#60;3
B00006EXDM|5.0|I love the rolling stones, one of the best bands ever..I bought this and it should be arriving soon. I have heard complaints though about it not playing on computers, which doesn't bother me too much..But can anyone please tell me if it plays in a car CD player? And also what SACD compatable players are anyway? Thanks to whoever answers my questions! <br /> <br />GO STONES!
B000000OQF|5.0|Everyone who says this is the best hard rock album of the 80's is absolutely right.  Rock needed an album like this in 1987 and got one and they need another one like it here in 2004.  This destroys everything done by Motley Crue, Poison, Whitesnake, etc. Slash is the man, what can I say?  His solo in Sweet Child O Mine is insane.
B0000029J5|5.0|Or any other day for that matter...Keb Mo has an incredibly appealing voice and his tunes have an instant familiarity that makes his music accessible and enjoyable. His country-blues acoustic guitar picking is traditional while somehow fresh sounding and the backup musicians are wonderful. This is a great CD from beginning to end.
B000002C2E|5.0|In this recording Dylan's dark lyrics are perfectly complemented by the raw grittiness of the sound production in a way that truly marries the words and music to create a unique blues feel.<br />Bob Dylan has written so many \\"masterpieces\\" over the years but to me there are two tunes on this CD that rank among his very best. Not Dark Yet and Trying to Get To Heaven capture the mature sensibility -seen it all-done it all, wrote it all down...attitude that seems so appropriate to a man who has produced a body of work that chronicles the last half century.<br />In addition to the bluesy haunting quality of the sound , there is something uniquely American in Dylan's writing that comes out of the both the backroads and the urban experiences and combines them. Several of the songs begin with  either the line \\"I'm walkin'\\" or some other reference to mobility and movement that is for me the essence of Dylan's work. This is great road music.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I couldn't help but laugh when I read Jeff Shannon's review & saw him compare Underworld to ... Independence Day???!!!  GIVE ME A BREAK!!!  If anything is (and I'm quoting) \\"all surface, no substance, filled with derivative, grand-scale action,\\" then it's definately the latter, not the former.  Underworld is a RARE gem!!  It's an action thriller that combines kick ass action sequences with great writing, stupendous acting and MIND-BLOWING special effects.  And the cinematography?  It just BLEW ME AWAY!! After seeing this movie, I felt like I got my money's worth, and I think you'll feel the same way.

B000000P17|1.0|Anyone that says that this is a good Guns n Roses cd is either in a state of denial or are smoking some pretty good weed.If you want some good GNR music buy Appetite For Destruction and then downlowd a few songs off of their Illusions cd's and make a greatest hits cd.Save your money and stay clear from this mess.
B00005MIZ5|5.0|Monk on Blue Note with superb supporting musicians playing many of his best known compositions. Can't go wrong here. My favorite tracks are on the first half of the CD featuring Milt Jackson. Check out Willlow Weep For Me and you will be instantly hooked. Monk's music has a vibrancy that is really captured in these recordings and for either the uninitiated or hard core Monkophiles this is a must own CD. Of all the guys who came out of the Bebop scene Monk's music stands out as the music that remains as fresh and challenging as anything being done today. Do yourself a favor and check this out.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is pure genuis. Right when I saw that paper bag with the leaves I knew it was going to be a hit.This movie is a piece of art, something just speaks to me when I watch it. Its such a masterpiece couldn't have put it better myself. its better than life. I can't stop watching it, all of the actors are so good and real. Kevin Spacey is the best actor and it shows. And the \\"beautiful freak\\" is my secret love. That movie is meanigful and I absolutely love it, go ahead and buy it trust you won't be sorry. Its my favorite movie without a doubt.
B0002I831S|5.0|Being a Colombian living in Colombia, every few opportunities I had to travel to the US I used to buy tapes of Star Trek the original series. I began in 1985 and though of lately had become a little lazy I got almost there, all the 79 episodes, but never was able to do it.<br /><br />...and then there are internet and Amazon and so on and this fabulous collection is beamed down to me.<br /><br />What I think? It is all I had dreamed about...well almost. Regarding the bottom line (having the episodes with great video&sound quality) it is mission acomplished but:<br /><br />-though the clamshell package is terrific the album style plastic cases the DVD's are actually stored in are not. I ended breaking up one of the small plastic legs in each one of them in order to make an easier job of using and storing the discs.<br /><br />-I would have liked much more bonus material, much more.<br /><br />-Though I consider myself pretty fluent in English many in my family and/or group of friends are not. In these times it is not understandable why such a worldwide liked production like Star Trek was not made with subtitles in several languages.<br /><br />-last but not least the set is very expensive. It has ever increased in price after I bought my sample. Second and third seasons are becoming even more expensive. Sigh... I suppose is a matter of offer and demand.<br /><br />To end the subject, I LOVE this set, every second of it.
B00005NB8K|5.0|The thing about most rock movies like this one is that in reviewing them, people are often caught up in the accuracy of the presentation. Is this EXACTLY how Jim was? Is that REALLY what Patricia and Jim did together? And what about that Ed Sullivan thing, did that really happen?  <br /> <br />Please, people. If that's what you're looking for, watch an actual Doors concert. Watch Jim Morrison interviews. Read a decent biography. This is a MOVIE, coming straight out of Hollywood. As Oliver Stone says in the bonus features, it's his interpretation of a figure that has fascinated generations for decades, even after his untimely death in the early 1970s. <br /> <br />Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. It's certainly legitimate to be annoyed at minor factual inconsistencies, and the like. Also, this movie was bound to make at least SOME of Jim's closest relations angry. Patricia Kennealy hates poor Mr. Stone with a passion (but then she hates most everyone these days, so that's probably not saying much). Ray Manzerek, keyboardist for the Doors, called the movie \\"atrocious\\". Perhaps this isn't what Jim was like -- in my opinion, it was slightly unfair, the way Stone handled Jim's drug and alcohol issues.  <br /> <br />However, despite all this, I love the movie. It wasn't supposed to answer any questions, it was supposed to represent one man's image of the Lizard King (\\"whatever that means\\"), and this image is surprisingly universal. He recreates the hazy world of 60s L.A. with magnificent usage of color, music, and set, so that this movie is a visual feast. The Doors songs scattered throughout are also quite accurately placed -- the misty effects of 'Riders on the Storm' are especially poignant in the beginning of the film, and a recurring theme in 'The End' is an interesting film technique. All in all, it builds a very interesting view of the late 60s, Jim Morrison, the Doors, and their world. <br /> <br />Oh, yes, and the acting. The acting in this movie is tremendous. Meg Ryan does a wonderful job as Pamela Courson (Jim's common law wife, and longtime love), with a great performance in a violent Thanksgiving scene. Though I forget her name, the actress playing the witchwife Patricia Kennealy is also quite impressive, though based on the real-life Kennealy's recent endeavours, I'm not sure how realistic her interpretation was. And, of course, the impeccable Val Kilmer. Some may say he didn't display all the facets of Jim to the extent that he could, I say don't blame him for that, blame the script. His performances onstage conduct the same energy Morrison himself provoked in a crowd, his MysteriousDrunkenPoet interpretation was perfect for the mood Stone set, and I challenge any nonbelievers to watch Kilmer sing 'Light My Fire', and then put the actual song on. To the average listener - perhaps even the above-average listener - there is NO DIFFERENCE. The voice, the word-breaks, the tone... it's all perfectly on the mark. It's scary, actually.  <br /> <br />So, in conclusion, I challenge any negative critics of Stone's movie to include all of its features in their consideration. Oliver Stone did not catch Jim Morrison on film. He encapsulated the mystery, the enigma that was Jim Morrison. He opens more questions than answers them, and rightly so. The only person that can REALLY claim to know what Jim was like is Jim himself, and of course he's not exactly around to do so. This movie is a triumph as a film, with amazing visuals, brilliant acting, and a true passion for the subject. It's extremely enjoyable, and comes highly recommended.
0156027321|5.0|Piscene Molitor Patel is a 16 year old Indian boy on a trip to Canada, when his ship sinks, leaving him to survive on a lifeboat with a 450 lb bengal tiger.  Sounds preposterous, doesn't it?  As you read Pi's adventure, you often wonder what is real and what is hallucination due to lack of food and drinking water.  Undoubtedly, others found his tale too hard to believe as well, so he told a second story.  But which is harder to believe, and which story do you want to believe?  Those are the questions the author wants you to ponder as you rejoice in Pi's struggle to survive so he can worship God another day.   <br /> <br />Many reviews criticized the front portion of the book, dealing with Pi's years of growing up in Pondicherry, India, his experience in the zoo and his multiple religious faiths.  Indeed, his multiple faiths could be argued to be conflicting.  But I found this to be interesting, in shaping the character of the boy who could overcome tremendous odds to survive. <br /> <br />Count this book as one that will be considered classic literature some day.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|ok at first when i saw the commercial of this movie when it was going to apear in theaters i thought \\"why the hell is will ferrel doing this, i mean this isn't like all the other projects he's been doing in the past\\" then i finally saw it at a friends when it came out on dvd and it actaully didn't turn out bad at all.  Sure it isn't your typicall Feral movie but its cute and heart warming so everyone will be amused.  Feral did a great job at this movie and youll probable agree w/ me 2 once you rent/ buy it.   <br /> <br />Only thing that seemed fake to me was when the one blonde babe ends up falling in love w/ him.  That to me just was unexpected and kinda weird but the rest of the movie was perfect so all in all i give this movie a 4/5
6304698682|4.0|After many years of box office failures, the Western was deemed dead by Hollywood.  No one would touch a western feeling that the genre had run its course and the public had mossied along.  They were all wrong.  Leave it to Clint Eastwood to revive a dead horse.  This is different from most westerns.  It's smart, warm, and very grown up.  No killins for glory, no damsels in distress.  Real life situations, and common folk.  Sort of like a country song from Kenny Rogers, enjoyable and simple.  Clint also directed this movie and it shows his flair for cinema.  If it weren't for this, there wouldn't have been a \\"Tombstone\\" or an \\"Unforgiven.\\"  This is a gem well worth owning.  It's one of Clint's best works, on and off screen.
0767903862|5.0|I'm headed to Australia in a couple of months and generally don't care to add to my heavy university reading any labor-intensive books, but Bryson's In a Sunburnt Country both gave me the vocabulary to talk about and further explore Australian literature and entertained me.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone but xenophobics and illiterates.  It's a comfortable adventure through a decidedly uncomfortable land.  My only ciriticism is that, as someone who plans to backpack into the outback, it lacks in description of the excitement of the more athletic endeavors that Australia has to offer.  But that is a small concern in light of the depth of factual and whimsical information conveyed without alerting the reader that he or she is consuming a lot.
B0002BO0US|5.0|The Zombies 'Odessey & Oracle' (with bonus tracks) may well be the best CD I've ever heard. I can't honestly say I've ever enjoyed a CD more. My son (age 17) picked it up on a whim, (he liked Time of the Season), last August, and I've been playing it ever since. I'm addicted to 'Odessey & Oracle'. I've listened to it countless times since then, like once or twice a day, nearly every day. It's the singing, the vocals. Euphoric! They are just so happy, just so glad to be there! This is a CD in which the band just loves to sing - joyous, baroque, harmonious Beach Boys Beatles Barclay James Harvest Steeleye Span-like, they just love to sing! The lead vocals, the harmony vocals, the second harmony vocals, the background sounds, the oohs and ahhs and Beatlely little accents and touches permeate the disc - this band just loves to sing. Euphoric, that's it. Every cut is a musical journey, every cut has something special to offer, including the bonus tracks, (on which they also love to sing). I have no idea how I missed this when it was new, but I did. It's magnificent. I'm forever indebted to my son for finding it for me. (good thing I had him!) If you don't have it, GET IT!!!  NOW!
B0006JC4UO|1.0|This isn't a review of the movie so much as a review of the DVD itself. First of all I purchased this exact same copy from Target for 1.00. Yes you read right, 1.00. I now know why it was so cheap. This movie as well as another one purchased look like they were done by someone videotaping a TV screen with a cheap camcorder. The sound and pitcture are horrible. The screen is jumpy and will have you seasick by the time the opening credits are done. To put it simply, Great Movie but a Bad DVD. Wait for the Official version that I have read is coming out in the near future.
0061020710|5.0|Note: since I HATE them myself, not one spoiler is included below... <br /> <br />I have been an evangelizing fan of both Kurt Vonnegut (best American  dark humorist) and Douglas Adams (best sci-fi humorist) since I was in high school.  I have read most of their works twice.  After having taken a couple of years off, I was about to swoop in for a third reading of their classics -- starting with KW's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" and \\"Deadeye Dick\\", then moving on to DA's \\"Dirk Gentley's Holistic Detective Agency\\" -- when Terry Pratchett's name popped up on a list of recommendations from Amazon. <br /> <br />After reading Pratchett's \\"The Color of Magic\\" (the first in the long Discworld series), I am absolutely bewildered by the fact that I have never even heard of this guy.  For me, it was like being a twenty years long fan of Hemingway, only to wake up one day to discover that there's this other guy named Fitzgerald writing about the disaffected youth of the Lost Generation as well. <br /> <br />I am afraid that Pratchett has flown under the RADAR screen of others, so I'm here, trying to get the word out.  He's got funny, funny, stuff packed in relatively short but highly inventive packages -- ready made for those like me who spend several hours a week on public transportation. <br /> <br />Net/net: if your sense of humor is a little twisted (think Monty Python or Dr. Who) and your sense of literary adventure strays towards the Hitchhiker series, or any of Vonnegut's novels, or even Mark Twain, then I guarantee you'll enjoy Pratchett's escapist, whirling, g-rated, and frolicing Discworld series.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I am sorry to say I was disapointed with this release. The characters are true, the original writing as powerful and imaginative as ever, yes the \\"darker\\" style shows through to great effect and huge advantage.

B00005NGZX|5.0|This album is amazing.  i love it to death.  it really doesn't matter what mood im in.  once i hear concubine, its all over.  i love the ride gained from listening to the whole album.  concubine jettisons you into a raging \\"fit of chaotic randomness\\" state.  with fault and fracture, you get a little back-up for that chaos feel.  distance and meaning brings your adrenaline down slowly in preperation for hell to pay which is one of the best songs on the cd.  brilliant song and probably the most original pieces of artwork to grace and album.  from there you are tossed back from your asention to the heavens to the pit at the feverish pitch of homewrecker.  you can't help but feel like going nuts to this song.  this song seems to take more from punk and the chaos the rest of the album is taken from.  and from there you go to broken vow which gives us rich cathartic vocals and just seems to build up to Bitter and then some which propells you into fits of kicking and screaming in an attempt to keep up with the music.  you are then lead to a slow song called pheonix in flight that would make any kid raise his or her lighter in reverence.  when that is over, your given to a seemlingly random bit of music (Pheonix in Flames)that introduces arguably the best song on the cd.  thaw is a mastery of sound.  not much more can be said of that.  afterwards, as a small token of gratitude, they leave you with a 12 minute monstrosity of a song to cool your nerves down.  this song, is the next to best song on the cd.  the cd overall is simply awe inspiring.  i only regret that i listened to it so quickly after getting into hardcore and metal because i have found no other that equals it.  it also seems like the kind of music emo kids would make if they turned to chaos.  just my point of view.  get the cd now.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP is much more than a revolutionary hip-hop album. The astounding virtuosity of Eminem on this album makes me smile. I hold this album very close to my heart. This album has helped me through some of the darkest, most depressing times of my life. Eminem's hate (whether emulated, simulated, or completely real) is something millions can relate to. Before Eminem, where were hip-hop lovers supposed to turn when burned with hate? Three Six Mafia??? Are they really the only other hate-venting rap group I can think of???<br /><br />The world needs Eminem. The Marshall Mathers LP is a guilty pleasure of the highest intelligence and caliber. Critics slamming Eminem only amuse me. Maybe they don't know what it's like to be really really angry with no chance of retaliation. What is a suicidal teenager to do? When you're rejected from the hottest females, bullied by the dumbest jocks, and singled out by teachers and parents, what can you do? Listen to Eminem! Don't you people understand? We listen to Eminem because we enjoy life. We enjoy life enough not to resort to horrible acts of violence and hate. Just listening to Eminem allows me to vent the hate I have inside.<br /><br />This album is timeless. From the public service announcement to the roof burning finale \\"Criminal,\\" the energy level stays constant. Lyrically, the album is insane, startling, hilarious, and relieving. \\"Kim\\" is the one to play when you're extremely angry. It is nothing short of a modern hate masterpiece. Then there's the fun single, \\"The Real Slim Shady,\\" which bounces along happily thanks once again to Dr. Dre's production. \\"Who Knew\\" addresses Eminem's social criticism perfectly. \\"Stan\\" is probably the most important track on the album, reminding fans never to resort to mindless idolization. Then there's \\"The Way I am,\\" a heartfelt complaint of the frustrating fame that comes along with success.<br /><br />The Marshall Mathers LP will be remembered for decades. It marks Eminem's victorious claim for the hip-hop throne, as well as his liberation of teenagers dealing with the frustrating reality of... life. Eminem is the man and this album is his best stuff to date. Cheers to Dr. Dre and Eminem!nem's victorious claim for the hip-hop throne, as well as his liberation of teenagers dealing with the frustrating reality of... life. Eminem is the man and this album is his best stuff to date. Cheers to Dr. Dre and Eminem!
