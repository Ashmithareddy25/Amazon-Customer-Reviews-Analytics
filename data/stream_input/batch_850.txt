B001EOQWF8|5.0|This movie was excellent.  It looked great on blu-ray.  Nice special features as well, totally worth watching.
B000WTBMBK|4.0|Despite the London based dubstep artist's efforts to keep his music underground (hence the name), Burial's mysterious new album Untrue surfaced in C-Bus a few weeks ago when a friend of mine showed me track two, \\"Archangel\\".  The hypnotic, mechanized vocal samples on the erie, lo-fi tune haunted me while I impatiently waited for my ordered copy to arrive from Amazon.com.  I even found myself listening to the thirty second clip of \\"Archangel\\" from the online order page, over and over on repeat, until the day the record showed up.  What's so captivating about Burial you ask?  Well, it's  hard to pin down, but allow me to embellish the sound of Untrue for a sec.  The signature jittery high hat shimmers and rim shot patterns, create a consistent, mellow breakbeat rhythm that gently but hastily pulls the synthetic strings and  pitch altered vocals toward what feels like is going to be a build up, but turns out to be just more anticipation.  Meanwhile, a dark cloud of exaggerated vinyl hiss, and a swarm of random, crispy blips loom over the mix, while an unimaginable amount of reverb sucks the whole thing into an ambient abyss.  There are really no obvious climaxes at all, rather a constant payoff in the gradual acknowledgment that the anticipation is fraudulent.  Over filtered, melodic vocal samples come and go like specters searching for a living soul to connect with. Hopelessly mumbling love songs, they rarely succeed in doing more than emphasize the somber, emotional void before being smeared into the hazy obscurity.  As the cover art indicates, this record is meant to be listened to on headphones, preferably with the jacket hood up, during an engaged people watching session.  You won't likely find this album on shelves around the city, so pick it up on online or at the very least purchase the \\"Archangel\\" mp3 from Amazon.com for ninety nine cents.  Just think how impressed your friends will be with your taste in dissonant dance music from the current London underground. - Tyler Starkey<br /><br />[...]nd. - Tyler Starkey    [...]
B001M5UDGS|1.0|Storyline very typical. Mad Doctor Taking over the world, and singing about it. Never been done, right? wrong. Dr. Steel, MST3K, And the Rocky Horror Picture Show, all feature singing mad doctors. I suggest if you want to be entertained that way, go to the other three for your jollies.  I miss firefly...
B0018RBN8C|5.0|From the first to the last song Rockferry has me walking on air and I dont want to come back down. I some what heard of Duffy but really didnt pay attention to her music but when I saw her video Warwick Ave I fell in love with that song.So I downloaded the album to see what this girl is all about and Im Glad I did.
1416562591|2.0|It was OK for an airport read, but what with the dozens of rave reviews on both covers, the Booker Prize sticker etc., I was really hoping this would be a book I'd find myself thinking about after I'd finished it. (Actually, I guess I did think about it...I thought, \\"Wonder how much the used bookstore would give me for this.\\")    My problem with it is, I've read this before. Maybe not set in India, but I've read it. You probably have, too: The crushing poverty. The ugliness. The small trap of a world and the attempt to escape it. Yadda yadda yadda.    Here's my quick review of The White Tiger: Take one of Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiassen's villains (skewed viewpoint? quirky language? murder? all here? good), put him in the narrator's slot, and sprinkle him liberally with garam masala.    If you have $14.95, a few hours, and a hankerin' for some sordid, black humor, then this might be for you. But it ain't no \\"Life Of Pi\\".
B000E5N62U|4.0|First of all - this has got to be the best sounding cd of recent times, I mean as an engineering effort - it sounds amazingly crisp and warm at the same time. An example: the track \\"What I Do\\".    Pretty much every track is a winner, although I do prefer the more straightforward Rhythm&Blues-esque tracks like \\"H Gang\\" or \\"What I Do\\" to the twisting and turning, and quite complicated tunes like \\"Great Pagoda Of Funn\\".     Of course the Steely Dan aspect is in there, perhaps he lets his soloists stretch out a bit more than on a SD album.    The Dan man didn't fail this Fagen fan.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I had already bought a set and decided to get another one for my spare controller so that I never have to take them off. They are that good. Why didn't Sony make those triggers concave up like these is mind-boggling. They are perfect if you like to play shooter and driving games.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|This is great cd/dvd. The music is wonderful to listen to, to exercise to, or to run to...   I wish I had bought 2, one for the home and 1 for the car!     The dvd shows just how drop-dead gorgeous they are...
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|This is a film adaptation of the classic The Iliad by Homer and it's loosely based on this work. They decided to give it a more historical setting and took out most of the references to the Gods exception in just a few references. I read they wanted to keep it out of the realm of fantasy and this was the reason for the removal of the Gods, but I felt that they were very important to the story and this would have been different if they would have included them.<br /><br />But that aside the movie is well done. They don't vary from the plot enough to change the story significantly. The actors in this film are all very good and Orlando Bloom played Paris to a \\"T\\". He played the version of  Paris as a weak, facillating character very well that I sometimes forget he can be otherwise. Eric Bana did a good job as Hector and I feel that so far this is his best. Pitt, I'll admit, is lacking a bit for me as Achilles, but he does his best.<br /><br />The action scenes are good, the dialogue isn't too bad and the pace of the story is done just right. This is a fun movie to watch, but the book is better.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|This is a beautifully packaged, and brilliantly remastered issue of the Bee Gees' Odessa.  The slight variations between the stereo and mono versions are a highlight for the dedicated fan, and the demos and out-takes an absolute gift to any listener.  It is profoundly moving to remember that Barry Gibb was all of 22 years old, and his brothers Robin and Maurice only 19 when they wrote and recorded this work.  It is so rare to see such absolute genius in artists of that age, and as we all know, that genius was to make its mark in four more decades to come.  A must have for the fan, and a should have for any lover of music.  Great work on the parts of the Brothers Gibb!
B0007KTAU4|5.0|THIS IN ONE OF THE BEST, IF NOT THE BEST CD, I HAD EVER HEARD.  THE LYRICS ARE MAGNIFICENT,  THE MUSIC IS GREAT AND CARLA BRUNI VOICE, ANGELICAL
B001GQSY5K|5.0|Well, after watching the series on Cartoon Network, I decided to buy this movie to see how it all started. I really liked the series, so I figured that the movie should be at least as good as the series, and it is. This movie and the series really adds to the star wars universe in a way that you couldn't do in live action. With the success of the movie and series, I really think that Lucas could add to star wars by making Episode VII, VIII, IX in this 3D cartoon format. I read a script from someone online that was written for those episodes, and I think this would be the perfect way to bring back Luke, Han, and Laya. He wrote it himself, and the story was great. Anyway, this movie and the series are great additions to the Star Wars Universe. Another note for those of you waiting for the full series set to be released, Lucas is doing so sometime later this year. He is releasing the 4 episode sets per fan request, but will release the entire series with a lot of extras later this year. you can read about this at: [...]
0525951113|5.0|If I could, I'd give it 10 stars!<br /><br />I read an article about this book in USA TODAY and thought I would give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did.  This book grabs you from the first page and does not let go!  The twists and turns in this book are fascinating.  You do not need to be computer literate to enjoy this book.  The only downside to this book is that you have to wait until next year for the sequel.  I'll be reading that for sure.  If you want to start the year off with a terrific book, this is the one to read!  I highly recommend it.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I watched it about 8 times before I had to take a break. It was just so cute, so fun and so different that I couldn't stop watching it. It's not your typical Disney movie. There is very little dialogue compared to a normal Disney film and in this robots are the main characters and not humans.<br /><br />I loved that it was a love story above whatever poltical reasons people were trying to assign to this movie. Sure it showed what rampant pollution can do to this planet and what a little care can do also, but that wasn't the main point. No, it was about love and how perseverence can win out over all.<br /><br />This is a family friendly movie. I took it to work and the children there loved this movie. So much a few cried because they couldn't finish it and some parents ended up staying just to watch it themselves.<br /><br />I wish I could give this movie even more stars than just 5.
B0015XHP3Q|2.0|The Picture was an upgrade from DVD, but the sound was terrible on all but the latest Rambo.  I wanted to upgrade all of the series, but I had to turn the sound up alot to even get a decent quality.  I have great equipment, all of the new sound upgrades, with large tower 3-way speakers and 100 watt subs in all 4 of the towers.       If I had the option again, I would pass.
B00005R24K|5.0|Now this is a great horror movie, I have watched this many times since it first came out and the shocks, gore, and suspense is still there no matter how much I watch this movie.<br />Bruce Campbell as Ash - he and his friends are going to a cabin where they read passages to the Necronomicon and out come the dead. His friends become zombie creature. This was inspired by Equinox (aka the Beast) nearly 20 yrs. earlier. Lots of zombies, squirting & splashing green, red,and black,blood. This is very fast paced. This is a must for any gore,horror or zombie fan. Directed by Spiderman director Sam Raimi - see where his roots come from. Bruce Campbell is at his very best here, this and Evil Dead 2 gave him cult status & a household name.
B00000JR29|5.0|As a long fan of TFF and probably my favorite group of the 80's, sorry U2, I felt that \\"Songs of the Big Chair\\" was their best release. It was a tough choice considering the synthesizer based \\"The Hurting\\" and the jazzy \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\" were also spectacular. If it wasn't for their sometimes negative and morbid theme of \\"The Hurting\\" I would have picked that one.  \\"Songs of the Big Chair\\" was an all around spectacular recording mixing different sounds and beats along with Roland's singing making it a very likeable release.  Some Highlights:    Shout- Very Popular tune that helped to define Roland.  Working Hour-  My favorite TFF Tune of all time.  Well done!!  Mother's Talk - Great beat and sound.  I Believe- Nice slow ballad.   Broken- Excellent guitar laden fast pace tune.   Head over Heels- Another popular tune.  Listen- An excellent synthesizer based instrumental.    TFF was the group that was responsible in changing my taste from art rock to alternative rock at that time. I credit \\"The Hurting\\" release for accomplishing that.  They have a such a creative sound and \\"Songs of the Big Chair\\" exemplified their best.
0385337388|5.0|The House of God should be mandatory reading for anyone in the medical field.  I ordered 5 copies to give to friends.  It may be old but still a keeper.  Amazon delivery was flawless & on time as promised.  I wish it was hard cover.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie is just as much fun to watch on DVD as it was to watch in theaters. I loved everything about this movie.<br /><br />Sure, it's not historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's the style of the movie that gets you. Sure the Spartans wouldn't have gone into battle with what amounts to leather undies, but the point shown was that they were prime fighting machines who were so good at what they did they \\"could\\" have gone in in what amount to leather undies. And face it, it was eye candy for the ladies to watch men run around half naked for a change.<br /><br />The battle scenes were fun, fun, fun. Even if they did OD on the monsters a bit, as my boyfriend said. The colouring of this movie served to enhance it just that much more. The special effects were good and so was the ending, even if you knew what was going to happen. (I think some people were shocked by it.)<br /><br />This is just way too much fun and will probably be a classic for this genre in the years to come.
B00003CXPD|4.0|Are all male dancers gay (poofs)? No, but his father thought they were.<br />The coal miner's strike and the Roman legion of police that responded<br />kinds of tells you that the liberals are out of power in Britain?<br />So a liberal film like this is probably a good thing?<br />The struggle with misunderstanding and prejudice in his own family<br />gives Billy Elliot angst.<br />I liked the movie and the dance teacher's daughter making a pass at Billy...
B00000JR2A|5.0|\\"The Seeds of Love\\" is TFF's \\"Sargent Pepper\\" It's an excellent jazzy sounding recording where TFF brings in Oleta Adams out of a night club. Oleta was quite appreciative with the duo as she later won a Grammy for her solo release. She brought a soulful and bluesy sound to \\"The Seeds of Love\\". Highlights:    Woman in Chains- Feminist's tune on their struggles. Excellent!!  Badman Song- Oleta at her jazzy best.  Swords and Knives- Typical TFF tune.  Year the Knife- A little edgy tune.     The recordings of \\"The Seeds of Love\\" are smooth and crisp as more real instruments were brought in versus a using an electronic synthesizer as a base for their recordings. I thought this was their 3rd best release to end a phenomenal decade.
B000NVADJY|5.0|I have recommended this book to everyone I know.  I think it is an essential book to have and read to better understand your life and death.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I loved this movie. It was so much fun and so silly at points you couldn't help but to laugh. While watching it I felt this would have been a perfect date movie for my boyfriend and I because it had enough action in it to satisfy both of us.<br /><br />I wouldn't have thought of James McAvoy as an action hero, but he works in some odd way in this. He does a fairly good American accent and is goofy without being too stupid. Angelina does a good turn in this film without being overly sexy. I was totally surprised by the ending and I felt Morgan Freeman did a very good job as Sloane.<br /><br />This movie has a fun plot, good plot twists and the special effects are fun and exciting, even if you've seen them before. A movie to watch this really is.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I have a set of twins, they both LOVE this mobile.  They'll lay there and coo and giggle while it plays.  I highly recommend this item.
1576754227|4.0|I listened to the audiobook as read by the author and I found it to be useful.  In fact, I'm listening to it again because I wanted to review some of Mr. Tracy's tips that I missed the first time.<br /><br />One unusual thing I noticed while listening again was in the My Own Story section where Mr. Tracy tells you a short version of his life story.  There appears to be a discrepancy in his version of events.  He claims that he dropped out of school before graduating.  Then for several years he was a laborer.  Let's assume this is at least three years or else he wouldn't have used the word \\"several.\\"  Then, he says he got a job on a tramp freighter and saw the world for eight years.  That makes eleven total years.  Afterwards, when he couldn't find laboring jobs any longer, he went into sales.  Add another year to make twelve years.<br /><br />According to his timeline, within one year of starting in sales he was a top salesman and a year after was made a Vice President in charge of 95 people.  Adding two more years brings us to a (minimum) grand total of fourteen years.<br /><br />None of this seems unusual until Mr. Tracy triumphantly adds that at this point he was only 25 years old!<br /><br />Does he really expect us to believe that he dropped out of school at the tender age of 11?  Could this be an example of Mr. Tracy trying to make his early life sound a little tougher than it actually was?  In the same way that a rap star claims to have grown up in the projects to give him more \\"street cred\\" when he really grew up in a middle class suburb?<br /><br />While Mr. Tracy's life story is strange, it doesn't take anything away from the advice in his book, which I found to be quite useful.  It has definitely reduced my level of procrastinating.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Whole family was up and we had a great time playing The Settlers of Catan.  Blessings to all
B001DSNEJM|4.0|I didn't know what to think after I finished watching this movie. I didn't love it, nor did I hate it. I just sort of liked it. The plot twists were nice, but not something totally out of the park. The acting was ok, but nothing stellar. The setting of the movie and the timing was very good though. I felt having the movie set in Oregon added to the suspense of the film.<br /><br />It's something to watch and something to make you think. But it's not something I could watch over and over again.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Some people have suggested that this new lower-priced Settlers of Catan is perhaps a lower quality than previous versions. Here are some comparisons..    1) This is the SAME 4th edition of the game that is available in retail stores for $42. There was only ONE difference from my \\"store-bought\\" version... the thief is now gray instead of black.    2) The cardboard hexagon tiles are a bit thinner than in the previous 3rd edition of the game. Some people have found it a bit of a challenge to get the map to lie flat. This is normal if you're used to a previous version of the game where there was no frame to keep all the hexes together (there was no sea frame, just sea hexes). So yes, it takes a bit of effort to push everything down but it will lay flat with just a bit of effort.    For new players: Please DO play your first game using the recommended map layout and starting positions in the rules. It can be tempting to jump right into a random map game where the map and setup is different every time you play - the trouble is, until you are familiar with the game, you won't pick the best starting positions. And a bad starting position will put you behind for the rest of the game and you won't have enough fun to motivate you to want to play the game again.    The same advice holds true for experienced players wanting to introduce new players to the game. Start with the basic map setup if you want to convert them into regular opponents.

0061537934|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a story about life, written from a dog's perspective.  It is about the hard times and the good, it made me both cry and laugh.  I am not a racing fan, but this book makes me rethink that.  Maybe I'll put on the speed channel on Sunday.  I enjoyed hearing Enzo's insights about what it takes to be a champion, which he applies to racing and life.  You won't be able to put it down, which means it will go by too quickly.  You'll want to read it again.

B001AN26VM|1.0|I have been waiting for an opportunity to purchase this product for almost a year.  An opportunity was made available finally through Amazon but what a nightmare.  I ordered it before Christmas, and it was shipped out to me on december 26.  However, as of January 23, I still do not know what has happened to my product that was brought and paid for.  When I contact the seller, he keeps telling me the same thing that it was already shipped and should arrive shortly.  Well, that has yet to happen.  This is the first time I have ordered a product from Amazon and was forced to wait longer than a month to receive it.  I am not pleased in the least.

B001GM28HO|3.0|Lady Gaga may not be the best musician around, and chances are this is the kind of album that the world will collectively forget in about a year or so, but still, \\"The Fame\\" does have its moments. Made for fans of absolutely meaningless dance-pop music, this is the kind of album that is meant to win over fans of Kylie Minogue and Rachel Stevens.<br /><br />Granted this isn't exactly my bag, but the album sounds good halfway through, and then quickly loses steam. Lead single \\"Just Dance\\" is no competition for Track 2 \\"Lovebug\\", but thats a minor quibble in an album that so frantically wants to proclaim its addictiveness. For the record, I found the production a little too techno and screechy, and had to listen to it in about three sittings before I could finish the whole thing.<br /><br />So is the hype justified? No, not really. This isn't really comparable to even the more average Dannii Minogue records, and its a pity that Lady Gaga saves her best stuff for other peoples' albums (check out her \\"Big Girl Now\\" on New Kids on the Blocks' new CD). But since shes having her 15 minutes, we may as well cut her some slack and let her enjoy it.<br /><br />Three Stars. Pretty much just average.
0446581348|5.0|It's a cool book. I got it as a present for my little sister who is learning how to use makeup.

1401219268|5.0|Watchmen will probably take a couple reads for you to be able to grasp the entire essence of what it is.  It is a political work of art riddled with original stories and characters.  The thing that works for Watchmen, is that even though there is so much information passing through the pages, all of it is very valuable as it combines into a piece as a whole.  The story reads like an actual screenplay and it definitely feels like it comes off the pages.<br /><br />Our characters instantly make themselves favorites in the comic book world.  Alan Moore couldn't have imagined better ideas.  He kind of makes fun of the superhero idea and slams our brains with the reality of it.  This realistic approach to superheroes totally gives comic readers a new perspective and that makes this novel extremely valuable.<br /><br />I won't get too much into the politics because I wasn't alive at the time.  I believe, however, that it gives the book a much bigger importance by tangling itself into the real world.  This stuff is very interesting for most readers.<br /><br />To conclude, I would say that this novel is a benchmark in graphic novels.  It is a cornerstone to the comic world.  I am very scared about the attempt to adapt this to film.  Zack Snyder is an excellent director, but as he stated \\"The movie is unfilmable.\\" I have high hopes, but with such an original novel I don't know if they will be able to hollywoodize it.  Alan Moore is one of the greatest writers of his time.  And this novel is his masterpiece.
6305754969|1.0|While I'm not a huge Duke fan, he is nevertheless the kind of actor who I assumed never made \\"B\\" movies.<br />This is a \\"D-.\\"<br />I've seen worse, but not much. No plot to speak of, but a disconnected scattering of undeveloped and uninteresting sub-plots, dialogue aimed at 12-year-olds, and to call the performances here \\"acting\\" is being far too generous. Wayne simply struts, talks, gestures like Wayne, Mitchum is his usually bland self, and Caan plays a tossed-in character that doesn't contribute enough (outside of wearing a much-remarked-on hat)to require any acting.<br />Not only will this movie not stay with me, I didn't really know what it was about while I was watching it.<br />Simply awful.
1400082773|5.0|This book is beautifully written, without a doubt one of my favorite books I have ever read. In every page you feel compelled by his remarkable honesty in the way he saw the world as a child, as a teenager and the way he sees it as an adult. You feel identified in many of his stories, emotional and inspired. This is also a remarkable book of self discovery and identity. I love the book and I am glad that book is in my shelf to one day be read by my kids and grand kids, and of course to be reread by me.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|In my opinion this is the best show i have ever seen. The creator and writers are brilliant for coming up with something that will make their viewers wonder what will happen next and what's going on. My 9 year old son loves LOST, we have all seasons 1-4 and we just started watching season 5 last night.<br /><br />It kills me having to wait a week for the next episode though, i'm not sure how i'll get through it. I usually wait until it's out on dvd but we couldn't help ourselves. I love the cast, when the ship exploded and Jin died i was in tears, when Sawyer jumped off the helicopter i almost died ... lol (i thought he had died).<br /><br />How can Kate choose from Jack and Sawyer, their both awesome guy's. It appears as if Juliet and Sawyer will be hooking up, hope not. I love Jack also, my husband thinks Kate is HOT ... duhhh. She has great hair, how the heck does her hair continue to look so good on that island though lol.<br /><br />This isn't a show for someone who's into watching constant action.<br /><br />But we love it and give it way more than 5 Stars.<br /><br />Keep up the good work writers.
B000001Y2U|4.0|This is my 7th Marilyn Manson CD! It was okay, but I still like the Eat Me, Drink Me, and Lest We Forget CDs better! If I had to pick one favorite song on this, it'd be Mister Superstar. If you are goth and love Marilyn Manson, you'll love ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay, this video IS HARD. Its divided into three segments. Level 1 for beginners, Level 2 for intermediate and Level 3 advanced. In my opinion, they are all HARD workouts. But as you move on to Level 2 and Level 3, they DO get more intense. I'm on Level 2 and it BURNED my muscles. It was an incredible workout but I have energy like you wouldn't believe. I highly rec this workout only because you can acheive the same amount of burned calories in 20 minutes that you do in 1 hour of running on the treadmill or doing dance aerobics which I hate. You only need dumbells and a mat for crunches and stretching. My only complaint is that I wish Jillian spoke less during the routines and concentrate on the whole group as opposed to her walking over to the other two trainers and showing the different options to the exercise. Its good that she does that but I don't think this is something she should do DURING the workout, its VERY distracting. This should be done at the beginning before starting the workout. Otherwise, I like it a lot.
0307455874|5.0|When I bought the book I was very skeptical about it, and I truly wanted to read it in a neutral way. Turns out this book became one of my favorite books. I was humbled by his style of writing and to see that it was like reading  my own thoughts and ideals. It gave me hope, it brought back a sea of emotions and dreams that I had once lost. I love the book! He is a marvelous writer, love it!
0312383320|4.0|This was the first full-length Between-the-Numbers book, and I think it was by far the best.  Unlike the usual Plum novels, here you have the addition of Diesel and his strange abilities, which makes for a different sort of adventure for Stephanie.  However, along the way are all your favorites -- Morelli, Ranger (though it could have used more Ranger), Lula, Grandma, stubborn bail jumpers, and wrecked vehicles.  Oh, and Elmer the fire farter. I'll say no more about him.  And let's not forget about Carl the monkey, who was a much more pleasant addition than I expected. The scientific plot here is a little more confusing than the usual Plum mystery, but I really enjoyed this listen.

1416955070|5.0|The City of Bones is by far my favorite book right now. If you enjoy Twilight, Harry Potter and Star Wars you will love this book. I absolutely loved the interaction and dialogue between the characters. The dialogue is whitty and hilarious. (Twilight reference) Imagine Edward with a sense of humor and Bella with a personality that is what you will have with Jace and Clary. The fantasy and sci-fi plot is very intriguing and will immerse you in the world Cassandra Clare has created. I originally read this book through my local library. After reading the first book I rushed to the book store and bought my own copies of the City of Bones and the City of Ashes.  I like many others have read the negative reviews for the City of Bones and I have faith that Cassandra Clare will address the issues in the third book and makes everything right. I can't wait for City of Glass...
031606792X|5.0|I am not a \\"reader\\" at all...but after picking up the first book of the saga, \\"Twilight\\", I became quickly engrossed in the world of 'Forks'.  The final book \\"Breaking Dawn\\" was my absolute favorite - finished it in only a couple days (all 760 pages worth) because I simply couldn't set it down.  I applaud Stephenie Meyer for creating a world that I love to 'get lost' in and the strong story of forbidden love that she tells.  \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is a must read - but only after you have read the first 3 books in the saga and have come to appreciate, understand, and love the characters.  You will not be left disappointed in this final book.  Even at the age of 27 and a mom of a 2 yr old, these books have inspired me with a renewed grasp of what \\"LOVE\\" really is.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I thought the first 15-20 minutes were kind of slow,but then it takes off and just awed me. I really loved how he caught his captors by surprise with that incredible armored suit.The things the suit is capable of is a blast to watch,in fact Fun,Fun,Fun is the most accurate way to describe this film,IMHO.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a fun movie watching time.
1416562605|5.0|Despite a few flaws (like cartoonish secondary characters), I strongly recommend \\"The White Tiger\\" for three reasons: (1) Aravind Adiga skillfully constructs an intriguing, humorous narrative that moves like the wind; (2) he brings us into a foreign world to which most Americans are oblivious; (3) it presents a moral ambiguity that you'll want to discuss long after you're through reading the book.
0446402389|5.0|In spite of the darkness of life in the end of the Stalin era, I would still recommend this book, because as the main character wakes up to his past complicity in a corrupt system and as the setting moves from the city to the countryside, you begin to see how people take tremendous risks in order to do the right thing. Sometimes they need time to think it over, and other times they act immediately, but they still have the courage to help one another, to seek out the truth, and to survive when they can do so with their values intact.     The mystery part of the novel provides the excuse for telling the story of the characters' struggle to survive, although it is nevertheless a well-told mystery. This was the first novel for the author, but it resembles a first novel in one way only--it has none of the trappings of the pulp fiction you find on the bestseller racks. The characters are deeply drawn and the writing is beautiful.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Fleet Foxes are the front runners in the indie/pastoral folk scene. Along with Midlake, the Foxes create shimmering folk/pop classics that remind one of the introspective seventies (csn&y)and the harmonizing sixties (Pet Sounds, beach boys). There is a subtle hint of traditional English hymn/folk that seperates Fleet Foxes from the other bearded troubadours.<br /><br />The album starts off stunningly with the beautiful Sun It Rises. The layered and popular White Winter Hymnal is next. The album meanders with pitch perfect harmonizing, creative musical passages and sterling production. The listener feels as though they've entered a time machine and have gone back to a rural past where simpler pleasures abound. By the time the understated Oliver James concludes the disc, this listener feels compelled to hit repeat.<br /><br />Since this album is unique, it is important for new listeners to be patient. This album is a grower. Each listen reveals something new. The melodies sneak up on you. Before you know it, you've got half a dozen Fleet Foxes songs vying for airtime in your brain (that's a good thing). Singer/writer Robin Pecknold is a rare talent. If you've ever marveled at the arrangements in a Buffalo Springfield song, you should make Fleet Foxes your next purchase.
B001ET0826|5.0|Prince was in the development stage of a project based on Homer's Odyssey - Glam Slam Ulysses - that morphed into a plan to simultaneously release a commercially-orientated album (that became The Gold Experience) and one more musically experimental, which is this album.<br /><br />Warner Bros. balked at Prince's vision and released the album in August 1994, with the 10 tracks clocking in at 48:43. Recorded between 1991-1994, the album reached #15 on the Billboard album chart with minimal promotion from Prince, who was engaged in a very public dispute with the record label. The single, Letitgo - which charted on four Billboard lists, the best being #10 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs - has lyrics concerning the professional turmoil. Another single, Space, had minimal success, peaking at #71 on the same Billboard chart.<br /><br />This is not Prince simply pushing back at Warner Bros.; it is a collection of material from an artist whose aim was to take his fans in a revolutionary new direction. It is a vastly underrated album from a period of incredible output for this iconic figure in pop music.
B00079ZACM|5.0|Definetly the best film version of this story.  Knowing there are no CG warriors or crowds of people or cities gives one a sense of awe when watching. Filmed on location and brings you back to the hayday of film making.  Great dramatic actors.  Ranks up there with Gunga Din, Lives of a Bengal Lancer and Zulu.  A classic not to be lost. The Korda brothers deliver.
B001E75QH0|2.0|First off, the first three of the set are superb films anyday. I had to and still do kind of struggle through the newest film... Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and do not particularly fancy it.     Indiana Jones was a household name as I was growing up and that was the primary reason I bought this set. But considering the poor audio quality, I would really advice any one to buy the single film editions, especially if you have the first three already. The music background is fine, but supercedes the voice clarity causing you to struggle to follow the film.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love this series. I have bought it for my grandparents, my parents, and a friend. It's incredibly phenomenal in every aspect, I only regret that they didn't put out more in the series. My grandparents don't watch TV or movies, but they love nature. This was perfect for them. It's one that can be loved across the board in all ages because who doesn't like nature. The cinematography is amazing, and the detail put into this is breath-taking. The only thing I would suggest is you buy the version with Richard Attenborough commentating, for some reason the Sigourney Weaver version isn't as great. But I guess that's a matter of opinion.

0439806119|4.0|Have you ever tried to find a wholesome, positive message in the YA section of the library lately?  It's like finding a needle in a haystack!  The cover of the book didn't look promising to me, but the title was intriguing and the reviews encouraged me to take a deeper look.<br /><br />Westerfeld has presented an awesome, balanced book that will appeal to a huge body of readers.  It is sci-fi fantasy with realistic proportions; it is suspenseful; it is about ethics and loyalty; it is about integrity; it has a romance that has boundaries; it presents the possibility of a healthy parental relationship; it promotes an environmental message without extremism. Most importantly, it helps young people redefine the qualities of beauty.<br /><br />The book begins in a futuristic society where Tally awaits her 16th birthday - a milestone when she will be ready to have the operation to make her a Pretty.  As a Pretty, she will enter the world of the Pretties - full of fun and happiness.  She meets another Ugly who tells her about a world outside the Utopian system and who tries to entice her to escape.  She wonders why anyone would want to avoid a world of happiness and the opportunity to be beautiful?  Their friendship results in a terrible choice for Tally. Which will bring more sorrowful consequences - to betray her friend or remain loyal and lose her personal hopes and dreams?  This young girl's choice unravels a dark secret and changes society as she knows it.<br /><br />Uglies is very well-written with characters that are gradually and skillfully developed.  The plot unveils at a consistent pace so that there is never a dull moment.<br /><br />One caveat - like Lays Potato Chips, you cannot have just one.  While sufficiently resolving the first novel, the author has built-in a device where you will be compelled to read the sequel.  So, I'm getting ready for another weekend on the couch to read Pretties next.
B000NIVJEU|5.0|The movie fails to translate the wonderful story of Eragon to the screen very well, but overall its not so bad.  The special effects, however, are wonderful.  The scenery is beautiful and the dragon look very real.  Its a great movie to watch to appreciate your large screen HDTV.
0307276902|4.0|Does it matter if the author of a book about addiction actually went through the grueling tale of detox and rehab he vividly describes?<br />Does it matter if he claimed publicly to have been more addicted and tougher and it turns out he's not?<br /><br />James Frey's novel, A Million Little Pieces, has been the subject of a whole huge polemic. Amid the wrath of Oprah and accusations that the author is a fraud, the book is actually really quite good. I've never been addicted, nor do I have friends close to me who've been through rehab or detox, but Frey's description is both uplifting and bone-chilling.<br /><br />Does it ressemble a true account of a treatment center?<br />Not even with wild exaggeration, say some critics.<br />But again, does this affect the quality of the book? Of the writing? Of the story?<br />The author's integrity, maybe. But the ability to move and explore and transport that is the quality of good fiction--no. Controversy doesn't affect this part.<br /><br />I especially liked the more spiritual side of the book, complete with citations from the Tao de Ching. I don't know much about AA, but the book certainly doesn't make me want to join. Perhaps this is a drawback of Frey's supposed fabulations?<br /><br />My one criticism would have to be about the love story : without spoiling the plot, the denouement of the relationship with the central female character could have been played out a little more. A note in the epilogue seems a bit short shrift for tying up something so key to the story.<br /><br />Regardless, I would recommend this book. It's well-written, entertaining and gives a memorable description of addiction any reader won't soon forget!
B001H5X7I4|1.0|I thought this movie would be funny with Stiller, Black and Downey in it. I was very upset with paying $20 for this movie and being disgusted with it. Every other word out of anyone's mouth is a F-bomb, I guess they thought if they could cuss alot it would make the movie better. There were a VERY few moments where you may laugh, but the rest was not worth it. I dont know about most people, but watching Tom Cruise with a fake gut and bald head screaming and yelling at everyone on the screen and then trying to save his screen time by dancing at the end of the movie was HORRIBLE.    You need to rent this movie before purchasing it unless you are into crude humor.

067940581X|5.0|I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.    Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.     I found this novel incredibly amusing!  Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.     When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not thesame Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.     If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature. Five stars!!

B000K7VHQE|4.0|During the 2006 Awards Season there was no film that made an impact quite like `Little Miss Sunshine'.  You can argue and say that `The Departed' made such an impact, beings that it did walk away with top honors, but seriously, no one was talking about `The Departed' like they were talking about `Little Miss Sunshine'.  It became a phenomenon.  The following year `Juno' waltzed up to an Oscar nomination thanks to the success this little yellow bus and even this years `Slumdog Millionaire' is being called the `Little Film that Could'.  `Little Miss Sunshine' represents that little independent film that garners cult status quickly and finds a place in the hearts of award bodies everywhere.<br /><br />Now I liked this movie, but personally it isn't deserving of the unabashed praise it received.  It's actually quite common and not very imaginative when you think about it.  It's sweet and charming but nothing new, and while it has it's moments of wit it also has awkward moments that you know are supposed to be funny, but just aren't.<br /><br />It's a mixed bag for me.<br /><br />The film follows the Hoover family (as dysfunctional as they come) as they embark on a cross country trip to get young Olive to a beauty pageant.  Richard, the father, is a self obsessed man who aspires to get famous off his step program to a better you.  His wife Sheryl is merely trying to hold together her family while remaining remotely sane.  Their oldest son Dwayne has taken a vow of silence while he waits to join the Air Force.  Richard's father Edwin is a foul mouthed gruff drug addict with a heart of gold and Sheryl's brother Frank is a suicidal teacher who is crumbling emotionally after a sour relationship with a male student.  Stuck in the middle is young impressionable Olive who just wants to be pretty.<br /><br />Everything that can go wrong does go wrong, but tagged onto the end of this comedy is a message of togetherness and family; a spark of sweet saccharine goodness that makes you feel a little better about yourself and your loved ones.  I understand why people like this film; even I liked it, but I find it hard to consider it the best of anything.<br /><br />Breslin is a natural talent; very genuine and believable.  One friend of mine said that he never caught her acting, which is very true.  I have always liked Kinnear and I found his turn here probably best in show.  He was superbly entertaining and understandable as the controlling father obsessed with winning.  Toni Collette continues shining her beacon of light on everything she touches; and I adore her for that.  There was a lot said about the supporting actor race that year and the three `Sunshine' men; Alan Arkin, Steve Carell and Paul Dano.  Honestly I fell that AMPA's got this one right, and I know that not many agree with me there.  I thought that Arkin was very genuine and heartwarming here, even at his crudest.  No, he should not have won, but that's beside the point.  Carell was also very warm here and understood his character (what a stretch for him) and Dano was interesting yet a little vapid.  I found his emotional breakdown rather hard to believe, but he does try really hard so I'll give him props for that.  He stepped up his game in a HUGE way the following year with a stellar performance in `There Will Be Blood'.<br /><br />Truth be told, the funniest parts in this movie involve running, and just the sight of any of the cast barreling down a street or a parking lot gives me the giggles.  It is also a true statement that some parts of this film fall flat.  Like I said; a mixed bag.  It's fun, but not great.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|I pre-ordered this CD last Oct before hearing it because I had great expectations - I was not disappointed.  Like the two albums preceeding it, it is sheer perfection.  A little different to the other two but at least equally as good.  I love every track - in fact I love every track on all three of their albums - Keane is the only band that achieves this for me.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Seriously, this thing rocks.<br /><br />Support the artists, buy the product. there are two commentaries (ok, one is a joke one, where they are all singing, but still hilarious), videos from \\"join the evil league of evil\\" contest... and probably other extras, but i'm at work.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like it, buy it. If you're not sure if you're going to like the video, check it out on Hulu.com first. You'll want to buy it.
B001KL3GWM|4.0|My signed copy (!) of Already Free arrived from the US this morning, in the same post as my tickets for the April 22 DTB gig at Shepherds Bush Empire - an exciting day! I've listened to it a couple of times, and I think it's going to take a while to grow on me. There are some excellent, immediately accessible tracks, and the band is extended to include other musicians, notably Doyle Bramhall II, with whom DT played with Eric Clapton on tour last year, and who co-produces some of the tracks here. My first impression is that this album has a narrower musical spectrum than the superb Songlines, which is on almost permanent play in my car. However, each of the previous DTB albums have been rather different from one another, so I suppose fans should have expected this! This album is the first produced by DT himself, and recorded at his new studio at his home in Florida. I think that DT's innate humility has resulted in less prominence for his own playing and more emphasis on a group performance. It has a more bluesy feel than Songlines, with the world/roots influences definitely muted by comparison. However, my immediate feeling is that if I'd never heard Songlines, Already Free would be brilliant and worth 5 stars. So, I guess it's going to take a while to soak in, but I'm sure it will become a favourite in time - I find that albums with immediate payback pale after a while, but those you have to work at a bit are ultimately more rewarding. Definitely worth buying - and perhaps a more gentle way in to DTB than some previous albums.

1589944607|5.0|This is a serious board game that is one of the best uses of theme I've ever seen. The gameplay is deep and fun socially (as you may be trying to hide your allegiance) and gives the players a great sense of urgency and purpose. You see, most of the time the players are cooperating to accomplish a very challenging survival goal. Very impressive, overall.    There are two downsides that you should know about.     1. It's one of those \\"major commitment\\" games. Everyone needs to commit to 3-4 hours of play. Especially when there is someone playing for the first time.     2. Being the secret Cylon is not always as fun as being on the other side, especially when you are working together SO HARD to survive and then you suddenly switch to the other side.    In short  If you are a fan of the show and have a group of people that like playing intense, epic, and long board games, this is a perfect game.
1401309666|5.0|[...]    However, the short version is this: The book is easy to read, and it has a ton of practical application for every business from snack food to shoe sales.     Even more important, it's fun, written like an article in a magazine and something you could knock out on a plane flight. Highly recommended.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|There's huge hype that preceeds this one, particularly due to the unfortunate death of Heath Ledger. It's lead to critics of Ledger's performance claiming it is oscar-worthy, which would be unheard of for a comic book movie. Unlike the feel good plot of [[ASIN:B001C08RHA Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)]], I've noticed young kids actually get a tad freaked out at the scariness of the Joker.     Dark Knight is dark and gritty. Dark Knight is a big departure from the Tim Burton's gothic Gotham. This is not comic book. Rather it's grounded in a seemingly genuine US city which makes it that much more creepy. The well paced acting and dry satirical script make this flick somewhat a masterpiece.

World Without End was just as amazing.  Like Pillars, I could not put it down and I did not want it to end.  I want more!!!  Highly recommended.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Fantastic casting of Downey as the billionaire industrialist cynical hero, and his mentor mentor Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), as the evil corporate titan profiteering from other people's suffering. (I know it's horribly cliche, but he pulls it off well).     Brilliant plot and more crucially the writing, which offers interest for both the children and the adults, despite being a a comic book hero. Special effects carry the plot along nicely. Recommended to keep around when there's a house full of kids and bored parents sipping hidden scotch.
B000053GTK|5.0|'In A Glass House' ranks right up there with 'Free Hand' and 'The Power and The Glory' as far as I'm concerned.   Brilliant album all the way through.  The album starts off with the breaking glass rhythm flowing very nicely into 'The Runaway', which I'd only heard so far on the live GG album 'Playing the Fool'.  The studio version is fantastic.  'An Inmates Lullaby' is good, more subdued, where Derek Schulman sings in a strange falsetto. 'Way of Life' returns to an upbeat rocking tempo altho there will be tempo changes throughout the song, with some great keyboard work from Kerry Minear and great guitar from Gary Green. Very progressive sounding, I really loved this track.  'Experience' is another great track that, before this cd, I had only heard live. Kerry Minear handles the lead vocals with Derek handling the 'Master inner voices, making the choices' part.  It's *classic* Gentle Giant.  Next comes another Minear track 'A Reunion', a delightful medieval piece featuring some nice violin from Ray Schulman.  Minear's vocals in the studio are fantastic, but as I understand it, too weak for live performance where Derek usually takes that task.  However, Minear is the natural choice for all GG medieval style music.  The studio tracks conclude with the title piece 'In A Glass House'. Once again we hear some really nice violin to start and then Minear's progressive keyboard work.  There's even some saxophone in here from Derek.  This track could be considered a showcase of GG's multi-instrument viruousity.  The track fades out and ends with an audio collage of bits of the album.  Very nice.    With the Alucard release, you'll get two live bonus tracks; 'The Runaway/Experience' and 'In a Glass House'.  Both are worth the price of this album alone, but coupled with the brilliant studio tracks, make this an essential GG album.  5 stars.
0439023483|5.0|is that this book came out in fall of 2008 and I read it in January of 2009. Now I have to wait for what I'm sure will seem like AGES for the sequel to come out.    Needless to say I loved this book. It's nice to see a girl/woman take charge and be truly resourceful. There are no princes waiting in the wings to save her. She is her own champion. Katniss lives in a world so desperate that love is stretched to the limit. What will you do for your sister? Will you starve for her, commit illegal crimes punishable by death for her, and even die for her? What will you do when a stranger saves your life with a simple gesture? Owe them forever? Save them in return at the cost of your own life?    With the livelihoods of her sister and mother resting on her shoulders Katniss's situation seems to harsh for her to keep any bearing on humanity. What is the point of morality when you are watching your loved ones starve? Yet, even in the middle of the brutal Hunger Games in which her life and death struggle is merely an amusement for the wealthy she has a respect for human life surpassed by no one else. Unlike those with lots of food and comfort she does not have the luxury of caring about anyone but herself and yet she helps, saves, and grieves over the lives of everyone she meets. She's not sickly sweet, innocent, or annoying. But she does everything she can to be honorable and kind just as she does everything she can to survive a senseless bloodbath in which she's expected to kill anyone who crosses her path.    And I can't wait to see how the Big Brother \\"Panem\\" is to be dealt with in the next two books. Katniss is not one to back down from a fight and it it's obvious from the beginning that the eventual confrontation with \\"Panem\\" will be the biggest fight of her life.    Also I'd like to see just how the Peeta-Katniss-Gale love triangle turns out. Peeta (a kind, gentle, and even sweetly vulnerable baker's son) and Gale (a resourceful, cautious, capable, strong coal miner's son) seem to represent different sides of Katniss. Perhaps Katniss's choice between the two is more relevant to the world of Suzanne Collin's little post-apocalyptic book than what at first seems apparent.    I don't think this book is to bloody for most kids. I think that one of the important points to take away from this book is that life is harsh, tough, desperate but that doesn't mean we should give up or hide. Actually, I think a book like this might even be empowering for most kids. As a kid, I would have loved Katniss and would have wanted to be strong like her. Heck, I do now as a twenty something.    Please Mrs Collins! Write your sequel fast!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Harrison Ford might be old, but he keeps charming the audience. I can't imagine someone else impersonating Indy! Even if this film doesn't match the previous ones, it stands by itself making us enjoy what is suppose to be the last adventure for the old professor.[[ASIN:B001DTPZNY Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single Disc)]]
0439023483|5.0|I LOVED this book. This was truly a fascinating story.  I expected this book to be a basic adventure with the main charactor dealy with trials and tribulations, but I was deeply satisfied when the story line took on a romantic love angle.  There Katniss is in the wild trying to stay alive while at the same time dealing with her first real love experience which turns out to be a love triangle.  I truly can't wait for the sequal.  Suzanne Collins is a fantastic writer with a great and thought out imagination.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Its obvious message that promotes environmentalism might not go too well down throats of those who want it served implicit and subtle. Nonetheless, \\"Wall-E\\" is yet another instant Pixar classic. Combining affecting love story, grand adventure via space odyssey (without losing any clever references to that certain Stanley Kubrick masterpiece), and genuinely funny Charlie Chaplin-esque comedic antics by virtue of smooth and natural storytelling, \\"Wall-E\\" achieves a lot on many levels, and yet it is seemingly easy to dismiss it as a mere \\"cartoon\\". Funny, because we can take human cues from the robots themselves.

B001HN6972|5.0|Disturbing, thought-provoking and unabashedly erotic, \\"The Reader\\" is polarizing cinema: some might regard the film's distant, intellectualized treatment of the book as shameless Oscar bait; some, and that includes me, will regard its brave and no-holds-barred goal to represent a complex tale of moral ethics, personal guilt and shame and complicated love without any sprinkles of sentimentalization and emotional biases, as an achievement. Kate Winslet is meticulous: there is ongoing sadness and sense of being lost and broken under the exterior of her purposeful and mechanical persona. Simply great uncompromising drama.
0756404746|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has exploded on the scene as Fantasy's new king with his debut novel, and rightly so.  The Name of the Wind is a powerful read and Rothfuss is that rare gem of an author who has not only genuinely mastered the art of story-craft, he has utterly redefined the bar of excellence of an entire genre all within his first published novel.<br /><br />'Wind' chronicles the early adventures of our young protagonist, Kvothe.  In a few words or less, our hero encounters life's ups and downs as he pursues his goal to attend the University to become an archanist; a surprisingly simple and in hindsight, almost clique plotline for a 662 page hardcover book.  But herein lies the unparalleled talent of the author-- his brilliant storytelling.  Most remarkable is the haunting and beautiful description of music.  Rothfuss claims not to be a musician and I can hardly believe it.  I am a molded musician, and how a non-musician can capture that intimate and indescribable love with mere ink and paper is beyond me.  Wind's beautifully crafted prose and pacing sweeps like Beethoven or Rachmaninoff; we laugh out loud and sigh, sometimes cry inside, all the while reminding ourselves to breathe as the pages turn.<br /><br />Rothfuss has done a fine piece of work and there are but a few holes to poke at.  First is the above mentioned plot.  The plot was the &quot;weakest&quot; link in the entirety of `Wind' but herein lies the difficulty of confining arcing plot and broad character motives into a cut section of a story.  The Name of the Wind is the first portion of a continuous story never meant to be broken into a trilogy.  Most of this first book is character building and we get to know Kvothe in a way like you would a new friend over an autumn Sunday brunch.  To his credit, Rothfuss does a fine job of sectioning the story off in book one.  Near the end, we get a feeling of winding down, content with some victories and still hungry with some wants.<br /><br />Secondly, the numerous try-fail cycles regarding Kvothe and his love interest Denna became redundant, especially since each hopeful meeting ends pretty much the same way each time.  Denna is mysterious for no good reason and Kvothe's infatuation with her is not well motivated, though perhaps understandably so when it comes to the nature of attraction.  Near the end of the book, I'm rooting for Kvothe to rid himself of his obsession already and get along in finding his first real love who names him 'Dulator'.  Also superfluous is the large section regarding the draccus encounter near the end of the book.  Much time is dedicated to this rabbit trail of a side story which results in little more information gained of the antagonistic Chandrian, no souvenir of the rare draccus to take back to the University as show and tell, and another chance and convenient bump-in with the stunning Denna which ends in yet another dead end where the girl disappears and the boy must temper his raging hormones in disappointment.<br /><br />All in all, a most inspirational debut.  'Wind' is not just a one night stand.  With subsequent reads, slow down and appreciate the unique elegance of description, the lyricism and rhythm of the writing.  Each sentence is loved and carefully crafted, not a word is wasted or wanted, and our deepest emotions are touched with simplicity of words both said and unsaid.  Bravo for an arresting prologue bristling with questions and the reminiscently similar yet conclusive epilogue.  Hints and juicy bits of future plot are revealed in good proportion within Wind, not so much to leave too many unanswered questions, but making us near wild as we wait and clamor for the second book.  Readers be warned that Rothfuss is just warming up.  The back of the book blurb of Wise Man's Fear was recently released and it promises a sweeping scope of a story.  Combined with the expected quality of writing, readers are in for a treat.<br /><br />Name of the Wind is my highest recommended book of the year.  Considering this is only the debut novel, one can only imagine what will be rolling off the press in years to come as Rothfuss heads the pack of young, revolutionary authors that are pushing and redefining the limits of the Fantasy genre.  5 big shiny stars.f the year.

B001J9AQA0|5.0|the script have made a near-perfect album here.  if you like maroon 5, justin timberlake or david archuleta, this is better than the best of all of them combined.  great lyrics, great vocals, great arrangements and great songwriting.  i can't wait to hear more from these guys.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I was dragged to the movies over the holidays a feat I never normally enjoy, the usual run of the mill drama, action and romance, blah, blah, blah without the bang.  However when I saw this film I was amazed...     This is a powerful tale, however conceived. With a rock solid story line of love and romance but intermingled is the story of grit, determination and true human reality, Some either missed the facts, The presence of racism and discrimination and the power of the mind, body and soul or they just overlooked it enblock may be the reason it did not get its just ratings in the media.    A movie of Hope, A movie that says you can get it if you really want, Brandon Walters \\"Nullah\\" in his \\"young\\" role brings across masterfully these goals for life brilliantly.... Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman usual skills aside; David Gulpilil \\"King George\\" was sleek in his role. He made clear the section of life we most often forget... in people who have been here before us they have a lot to teach us if only we want to learn.     Australia, this movie, this story could be told basically anywhere in the world, any country within the reach of colonization and imperialism and the destruction of indigenous people and their way of life.    Romance Reality Drama Action and yes Comedy included. This was one of the best I have seen in quite a while,,,,, 3 Three Times over. And I will be watching for years to come. A must for any collector.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I first did Jillian's Levels 1 and 2 On Demand and my butt was so kicked I had to get the DVD. I've been in pretty good shape since losing the \\"bulk\\" of my weight over a year ago, and these workouts (even Level 1!) still kill me. But that's how you know it's working - you become very uncomfortable!    Up the ante by increasing your weights, and I warm up before with Bob's CardioMax for a really great workout. I've used this combo occasionally for months and I'm still good and sore the next day.    Jillian trains winners because she doesn't let them stay comfortable in their workouts. If you're doing OK, push harder!
B000002KAG|1.0|I have had a bad string of defective disks from Rhino. Read my reviews of Nuggets I and II. What a nightmare that was. This co. has a quality control problem these days. Don't put up with a disk that skips, even if it's just a little. Don't bother your dealer either. It's Rhinos fault. They have replacement disks for the boxes and returns on the singles (although it's gonna cost you some more time and money to send that back.) These days you buy Rhino at your own risk. Hold this co.'s feet to fire over this.
0312383320|1.0|This is a dismal book and I wonder why it was published. The author is using old one liners and silly concepts and truly awful characters.  Most disappointing. Ms Evanovich should give up if this is all she is now able to produce. Shame on her for thinking so little of her readers.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I bought this DVD the day it came out. Celine Dion is phenomenal. I have been a fan for many, many years and this show was incredible. Never a dull moment. So filled with color and great songs. If you are a Celine fan YOU MUST get this DVD.

0670020745|4.0|I purchased a number of these books for people related to stroke victims;  The writing is clear and the story compelling.  The author forewarns readers that Chap. 2 & 3 can be dense (indeed) but she feeds anatomical and physiological information as she describes her individual experience of stroke ( her recovery extended over years, --and she had a \\"good\\" one.!!) I moved on to another book stimulated by her references to the role of the left brain, and the role of the right brain and the communication between the two. She describes the ramifications of an injured brain and what symptoms could be manifested.  Sometimes her \\"right brain\\" and \\"being at one with the Universe\\" was too \\"touchy-feely\\" for me; my next book, however, was a Buddhist's understanding of Western neurology.  Go figure! She had given me a shove...
159102594X|4.0|\\"The Blade Itself\\" is a good book, a solid 4 start book.  The only reason it is not a 5 star book, for me it was a long long slow road to build up the story.  The story line held me just enough to turn the page, a few times I did think about putting it down for good, but I keep turning.  And in the end...........what an end, great, excellent, beautiful, bloody, a rip roaring fun read.<br /><br />So you are thinking should I buy this book and read it, right?<br /><br />The first 300 to 400 pages are a bit slow, but you do get to know the main characters.  So just think of it as good character build.  The ending is really that good, trust me.  I was unsure if I was going to buy the next book, now I am looking forward to reading it.  So go ahead push the purchase button, it's a good book, and the second book is receiving good reviews.<br /><br />Lastly its always nice to find a new author.
B00127RAJY|5.0|wow, this is a great workout. I started out with level one and for me whose out of shape, this was a killer. But, in such a good way. I felt like I did more than just 20min of working out. I can definatly see losing weight with this if it's done everyday. So now just to keep this up.

B000J103OI|5.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a staple in my personal movie library. Rarely has a lioness been more enticing or vicious in corporate America as Meryl Streep's \\"Miranda Priestley.\\"  Priestley is equal to task to Michael Douglas' \\"Gordon Gekko\\" in the movie \\"Wall Street.\\" But, why do we love these characters that would do anything to achieve and maintain professional success?  I believe \\"...Prada\\" is a microcosm of the world.  Most people are afraid to wholeheartedly go after the \\"Brass Ring.\\"  When we see the likes of a Miranda Priestley (Streep) entering onto the world stage, we love and loathe her simultaneously for her viciousness as well as her victories.  While she may exhibit somewhat psychopathic tendencies, she is not the shrinking violet many would have her be.  In fact, her subordinates become victims of the \\"Stockholm Syndrome.\\" While the fashion industry isn't a philanthropic endeavor, the characters become sucked into her vortex, enamored by the passion and sheer excellence Miranda puts into her vocation.  Meryl Streep was edged out by Helen Mirren's \\"The Queen\\" for the Oscar, but it's Streep's riveting performance that keeps me repeating the experience.      Watch \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" to be entertained and educated about the ways of the world. The most salient one liner in the movie was Streep's divulging a truism of contemporary society and its pursuit of acclaim, fame and fortune, \\"Everyone wants to be us.\\"    Edward Brown  Core Edge Image & Charisma Institute  [...]

B0012E6R3W|5.0|Maybe it's the smooth-growl of the vocals.   Perhaps it's that the instrumentals, despite their technical clarity, contain equal doses of heaviness and thrash.    But whatever it is, there's a certain anger ... or rage ... that comes through on many of the songs on this CD.  And let's not confuse this anger with angst: this is refined thrash-metal down to a distilled venom.
B00122Z5RI|5.0|No need to use this album as an excuse to pontificate on the sociological implications of punk rock. This is just a damn fine rock album. Whatever you want to call it - and i was 'there' in the early CBGB's days - this is a solid, in-your-face collection of good to outstanding songs played and recorded with power and punch. A 'must have' album.
1595141979|4.0|I just finished the entire series over an hour ago. Honestly, I thought the first book was okay. The second one was kind of boring for me. I was mostly annoyed throughout Frostbite because Rose was always on edge. Shadow Kiss is, by far, the best out of the three. I really enjoyed this one. Mead did a good job of making me feel what Rose feels. My eyes were watering by the end, but I admit, I kind of anticipated what happened to Dimka. I am extremely excited for the next book. The end was kind of a cliffie. I have a feeling the next book will surely surpass the current books.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I have a nurlogical disorder and after buying this movie I have to say for once in my life I can actually deal with they fact that I am different.  Ashton gave people like me the message that when times get rough to just hang on that it's ok.  I think it was so very sweet of him to make this movie and I sincerely believe he made this movie tring to change the lives of others.  He is really a cool guy!  I rate this movie the highest I possibly can, and highly recammend it....it was a big life changer for me...I love him to death he is the reason I am able to finally for one in my life deal with the fact that I am different.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I can never say I love a war movie, but watching Band of Brothers shows the intensity of war and gives you the instant respect for those whom have served. At the beginning of each episode when they interview real heros and hearing in their own words about their war experience, makes you feel their pain, the shake of every bomb blast, and the sound and movement of every bullet piercing or passing bye. These men and women at this time has no choice to serve, but the dedication and passion are in demand of respect throughout history.
1878424505|5.0|I bought this with some hesitation, not sure why. But was pleasently surprised. The four agreements, those we make with ourselves, if taken seriously would and do make you look in the mirror. The Author takes you through how we become who we are and then makes you look it in the eye. If you're serious about changing yourself for the better this book will help you along the way. I'm not mentioning the four agreements because you should buy the book. There is nothing new on earth but the Author puts this in an understandable and challenging way.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|Wonderful, realistic series. Character Sophie was the best as a teenage gymnist in therapy! It's just so real and how often does anyone get the chance to view therapy in action? If anyone is on the fence about therapy, this may be the means to convince you to get some help. Even if you don't, this series makes you think about your emotional life, the feelings and issues we have in common. Can't wait to buy it!
0307346617|3.0|This was a good read, but not exciting or compelling.  The author takes great pains to flesh out the world and experiences of survivors from different cultures and parts of the globe.  And in this, he does a wonderful job.<br /><br />This was not what I was hoping for, however.  The accounts of the zombie attacks are mostly dull recounts.  The main exception was an individual in a building when the zombie apocalypse strikes.<br /><br />It is interesting, and the characterization so lacking in many books is very well executed, but overall not the escapist fun I was seeking.<br /><br />If anyone has the same interest or reaction, you might prefer Stephen King's \\"Cell.\\"

B001H5X7I4|3.0|Tropic Thunder is a reasonably funny parody of several Viet Nam war movies including \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"Platoon\\". The cast includes Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Nick Nolte, and Tom Cruise. They all bring their particular talents to this movie, without which this would be a pile of bat guano. I was surpised no Private Gomer Pyle and Sergeant Carter showed up. When a group of actors is dropped into a real war zone somewhere around Cambodia after their director can't get them to cooperate, things get dangerous and interesting. A new side of the actors is seen, and not necessarily a better side on all cases. Jack Black's character wants to jump into the Heroine in the camp where they must rescue their technical advisor, FX man, and a fellow actor. Good quality DVD with a few extras. Lots of cursing, so not recommended for anyone offended by it. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Scary Movie\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
B0001US62I|5.0|A powerful and brilliant script, incredible acting, indelible images, all make this movie a collectors item. Mickey Rourke has always been a great actor - that is why his role in The Wrestler is even more poignant...a great talent returns.
0783230079|4.0|I lucked on this one by reading a comment about Robert Downey Jr. on a \\"Tropic Thunder\\" review. I went ahead and bought it as I like him as an actor and the reviews here seemed favorable. I'm truly glad I picked up this little gem. Great story, acting, and music make it well worth owning. I believe a TV series may have been based on this movie, but I don't know the details. Suffice it to say it is a warm story of friendship and love and not passing on a chance to try to make things right. Whether it is returning stolen stamps, singing in front of an B. B. King audience, checking what became of your kids, or making sure a couple doesn't pass up the chance to share each others lifes. A young man is followed by three spirits all his life since they died at his birth. At first they tried to help him but realize when he becomes a child they may cause problems with how others percieve his interaction with them. They later return when he becomes an adult since they finally find out they must use him to do the one thing they would have done before they died. This is a family friendly movie and I highly recommend it. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Forever Young\\".<br /><br />CA Luster

B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Never mind that the director used stock footage to fill-in the arena footage in the fight scenes; never mind that the boxing scenes between Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers)lacked the pugilistic realism and precision of it's superior descendant Raging Bull--Rocky is still the quintessential sports film about the ultimate underdog overcoming all odds.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this film's been out 32 years. Rocky is still as palpable as it ever was because it's one of those rare films that speaks directly to the heart--everyone pulls for the underdog. Almost all successful men and women were chosen from birth to be successful. These people are born to the right people and have the right pedigree. These people are born tall, or strong, or beautiful. These people may be born rich, or these people may be born into a stable middle class home. Even if they are born to a single parent, these individuals are born to a single parent who wants the best for them, a parent who'll sacrifice everything to send them to the right schools, a parent who'll scrub floors to send that kid to college. Some people are born and raised by both their parents and their grandparents. Look at Obama. Could he have overcome his racial heritage and his economic disadvantages without the love, guidance, determination, and support of his mother?--I don't think so.<br /><br />Then, there are those of us who aren't so lucky. We're born dirt poor. No one loves us. We aren't tall, strong, smart, or beautiful. We're doomed in the womb. We watch as others leave the neighborhood for colleges. We watch our neighborhoods change around us. A building's torn down; a new building goes up. We carry our dreams in our pockets with the few pennies we are able to earn with our High School diplomas; worse still, we're dropouts and can't find anything at all. We fade like afterthoughts. We become neighborhood faces,like that old busted chair or knicked-up table that never moves no matter what. You could paint the room, change the pictures, change the carpet, or change the sofa, but that old busted chair or knicked up table remains a constant fixture. You say to yourself, \\"if only someone, somewhere, gave me a break,\\" but all you get is scorn, rejection, and ridicule. There's no excuse for any grown man or woman to fail, they say. Go to work, they say. Why aren't you like such and such, they say. You should be doing this, they say. You should be doing that, they say. You look in the mirror and you see the deepening lines in your face; you look sad--you look away from your reflection. You crawl inside of yourself. You drink,you smoke--you don't care anymore. You're no good to a woman; you're no good to yourself. You're not a man anymore. You resign yourself to your fate: you're a loser. You'll live, you'll die, and that'll be that. So, you go and throw your last pennies and your dreams into a fountain and you make a wish. Then, out of the blue, opportunity takes you by surprise. At first it seems too good to be true. You're afraid that, at any moment, you'll wake up from a cruel shimmering dream. Then, you realize that you are not dreaming, that chance is smiling in your direction.You cry. You thought she'd forgotten you, but she didn't. Chance comes early for some and late for others and when she leaves she's gone forever. So you take your chance, and you make the most of it--you turn your life around and the people cheer you on. You're born again.<br /><br />To me, this is the essence of Rocky, and no actor could have pulled it off like Sylvester Stallone. If you've ever been down or counted out, his realistic and raw portrayal of a down-and-out loan-shark collector will resonate with you. Bill Conti composed the soundtrack to this film. When Rocky's sprinting across the wharf to \\"Gonna fly Now\\" you want to stand up and cheer him on. My favorite point in the movie is when Rocky goes down in the fourteenth round. Everbody--his trainer(BurgessMeredith)and his cornermen--are screaming and telling him to stay down and take the count-out. But Rocky's been down forever and this time he's fighting for the only chance he's ever had in his whole miserable life. Then, Adrian (Talia Shire) is standing in the back of the arena watching Rock; she's crying. She closes her eyes and says a prayer. Bill Conti's \\"Going the Distance\\" is soaring as Rocky makes it to his feet. He's bloody and swollen--he can barely see out of his right eye--but he shakes his head and tells the ref that he's ok. Then, with the champ bearing down on him, Rocky sees his opportunity. The champ's hands are high, his bruised right ribs are exposed. Rocky surges up with everything he has and smashes a left uppercut into the champ's ribs. The bell rings, and Rocky survives the round. I don't know if the film would have been as effective without Bill Conti's soundtrack; the soundtrack gave a voice to every scene in the film. Scorceses's Taxi Driver came out the same year as Rocky and many critics and fans feel that Taxi Driver should have won the Oscar instead of Rocky. If you go on the technical merits of both films, Taxi Driver is a superior film to Rocky; however, Taxi Driver does not stir the collective imagination as powerfully as Rocky does. Rocky is both universal and primal: almost everyone's been down at some point in their lives, and almost everyone has a heart--in these respects, Rocky is superior to Taxi Driver. I've seen thousands of great films, from Hitchcock to Bergman, Kurosawa to fellini, Lang to Lean, Kazan to Copolla; Rocky remains my all-time favorite film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001PKUVW6 Bondage and Discipline, Sadism and Masochism: Zack's Odyssey Part 1]]men--are screaming and telling him to stay down and take the count-out.

Bill Conti's \\"Going the Distance\\" is soaring as Rocky makes it to his feet. He's bloody and swollen--he can barely see out of his right eye--but he shakes his head and tells the ref that he's ok. Then, with the champ bearing down on him, Rocky sees his opportunity. The champ's hands are high, his bruised right ribs are exposed. Rocky surges up with everything he has and smashes a left uppercut into the champ's ribs. The bell rings, and Rocky survives the round. I don't know if the film would have been as effective without Bill Conti's soundtrack; the soundtrack gave a voice to every scene in the film. Scorceses's Taxi Driver came out the same year as Rocky and many critics and fans feel that Taxi Driver should have won the Oscar instead of Rocky. If you go on the technical merits of both films, Taxi Driver is a superior film to Rocky; however, Taxi Driver does not stir the collective imagination as powerfully as Rocky does. Rocky is both universal and primal: almost everyone's been down at some point in their lives, and almost everyone has a heart--in these respects, Rocky is superior to Taxi Driver. I've seen thousands of great films, from Hitchcock to Bergman, Kurosawa to fellini, Lang to Lean, Kazan to Copolla; Rocky remains my all-time favorite film.

0312360266|3.0|I would rate this more of 3.5 stars.<br /><br />I would not rate this book as highly as Vampire Academy or Twilight but it was still a good read.  It's hard not to like Zoey and her good girl yet not going to let anyone push her around attitude.  Aphrodite (and who can like someone who picks that as her own name) needed some serious butt kicking and I'm glad she got what was owed her.  Erik seems like a nice guy but you do kind of have to wonder about a guy who would date Aphrodite.<br /><br />Being a fan of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse/Southern Vampire series it was interesting to come across another series where vampyres are known to the rest of the world and are pretty much allowed to live in harmony, at least from what I could tell in book 1.<br /><br />I'm interested to see what happens in book 2 since Aphrodite had that one vision in which Neferet seemed to scare the heck out of her.  So it seems like she might not be such a good guy after all.  Especially with these ghosts of supposedly dead students wandering around.
0141182865|5.0|I read this as a local book club choice - it is fabulous!  What a shame he's not around to write more -it is SO funny!
B00005KHJR|4.0|This movie is quite possibly one of the best and most underrated movies. Don't even watch the Wicker Man remake, it hardly even comes close to the caliber of the original. Christopher Lee is amazing as Lord Summerisle, and his charm and wit are quite disarming to an unsuspecting Sgt. Howie. The entire cast does a phenomenal job and the special edition comes with the American release (don't bother, watch the extended edition) and the unedited British version (watch this one instead, it explains alot more and is far more engrossing) The only real problem is that on the extended one there are scenes which aren't the same quality as the rest of the movie (you can tell which is the older footage not originally in the film vs the better looking parts) It would have been nicer if they'd completely remastered both movies including the added footage in the extended movie. That's the only reason it's getting 4 stars. Well worth the money, I highly recommend this movie!
B001M4YZ90|1.0|This film had great potential (in terms of casting) but was *seriously overstretched* (in terms of plot).<br /><br />1. The movie was really convoluted. (I can't go into the reasons for this here, since it would take too much space to synopsize the plot.)<br /><br />2. The number of coincidences that went into making this plot were just waaaaayyy too many to be believed. It is nice when a *few* incidents come together to make a storyline, but this was just over the top.<br /><br />3. Guy Ritchie did do good work with \\"Snatch.\\" What the hell happened here? Ego? Sloppiness? Time constraints?<br /><br />4. The acting was good, as was the casting. There were even a few witty lines.  It's just that even those were not enough to save the greviously stretched plot.<br /><br />5. Save your money. This is not even worth a single matinee movie ticket-- or even an overnight rental fee. When this movie comes out in the USA, it will probably be on public television in, say, a week.
0380713802|5.0|I shouldn't like this book. I should hate this book. I should complain,deride and denounce this book because every time I read it, I wet my pants laughing. It should be illegal to make someone laugh so hard she wets her pants. It's embarrassing. This book is so addictive that I tend to pick it up wherever I see it. Since I am an avid reader, I pick it up in book stores and libraries. It's humiliating to be standing in a bookstore with your legs crossed and a warm stream of pee tickling down your thighs because you can't stop laughing. I should also be mad because Bill Bryson clearly stole all my experiences of travelling to Europe for the first time. I'm the one who couldn't understand the English language the way the English speak it, who thought they were angry when they said they were \\"pissed\\" and didn't know it meant \\"drunk.\\" I'm the one who spent the night trying to figure out what I was supposed to do with the window because the innkeeper told me, \\"Fold the pane.\\" Bryson stole all my material. The only reason I'm not mad is because he writes it all so beautifully, weaving the jokes into the story into the irony into the drama into the comedy, and does it so beautifully that this book disappears in hours when by rights it should take  days to read because it is so full of experiences. I denounce Bill Bryson. Off with his head. Send him back to Europe, but please let him pack his pencil and his sense of humour before he goes. He is a national treasure.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|BRIEF REVIEW<br /><br />Based on the earlier releases I was not surprised that this album is as great as it is. David Cook worked hard on all of this beautiful work and richly deserves every bit of praise he is getting - and will get - as more and more people become aware of each and every one of these brilliant collaborations. I knew Permanent was an ode to AC, but I didn't anticipate weeping immediately upon hearing the brief preview of this song. Anyone who has had a loved one ill with cancer can relate to the beautiful words and music. Every song on this album is outstanding. And just as David broke records previously on the billboard charts - I suspect this outstanding album will likewise soar to the top up the charts. Outstanding work.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL COMMENTS<br /><br />The more I listen to this CD - the more incredible it is. Call me crazy - but I could wait for the physical CD to be delivered so I ordered from iTunes - and commented accordingly based on the above brief previous review. Needless to say the music is outstanding - I have incredible taste - and that includes my love for David Cook's music. There was no doubt in my mind this album was going to rise to the top and deliver. And - of course - it goes far beyond our expectations - even for those of use who knew it would be great!<br /><br />PERMANENT<br /><br /> I can't STOP listening to this song. It is one of the best songs I have listened to in my lifetime. It has a haunting melody - and beautiful - yet gut-wrenching lyrics that make me want to listen to it over and over and over again. It is just as relative to someone going through a divorce - or any illness or difficult experience. I find it mesmerizing. It would be easy to hear any number of professional artists covering this song - from Bette Midler to Bruce Springsteen. Also - I really expect to hear it one day in a movie -- unless it is too personal for David to lend permission.<br /><br />DAVID COOK<br /><br />David Cook is a true artist and rock professional. There is no doubt - with his magnificently blessed voice and enormously charismatic persona that he will be a talent to be reckoned with more years and years and years to come. His voice is mind-blowing. His music is outstanding. His personal presence and charisma is incredibly vulnerable and sweet yet he exudes sexy beyond my comprehension. He is the real thing - something that those of use who love rock and roll have been longing for.

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is an awesome book that I would recommend to everyone. It has a lot of symbolism and a kind of mystical feeling woven throughout it, which really kept me interested. There are also quite a few bits of wisdom and mini-proverb-like sayings that the author incorporates into the story. What's really nice about it is that the reading level isn't too difficult. In fact, this was a rather easy read, which is really fitting for this book because one of the main themes of the book is the simplicity of how the world works.     I also enjoyed how the author incorporated beliefs from different religions into the \\"truths\\" that Santiago (the protagonist) learns about throughout his journey. Granted, I do not believe in alchemy or watching for omens or anything of the sort, but I am a nature-lover, and there are many times that I have enjoyed just sitting and observing nature, which Santiago does quite a bit in the book, and which I think everyone should take at least some time to go and do at least once in their life. My point is, no matter what beliefs someone holds or religion they follow, there will most likely be some part of this book that they can relate to.     This is truly a wonderful book, and is not meant to be picked apart and micro-analyzed by the reader. Just sit back, leave your mind open, and enjoy the journey.
B0002DB50E|2.0|Very weird film with a dark message about TV watching, I guess. I wasn't entirely sure where this was going, and I wasn't terribly impressed with the swamp monster special effects. This has gotten all sorts of cult worship over the years, but I really can't see why. Debbie Harry gives an interesting performance, and James Woods does the same hyper-schtick he went on to give throughout his career. I did like the ominous, spooky organ soundtrack, like something out of \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" For Cronenberg fanatics only.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|It was quite amazing and significant that Joss Whedon produced Dr. Horribles Sing Along Blog during the writers strike.  Not only was it incredidly done, offered free over the internet, and turned into a dvd, but Joss once again outdoes himself by including a \\"MUSICAL COMMENTARY\\", thats right a \\"MUSICAL COMMENTARY\\" on the dvd.  He also includes a regular commentary as well.    Dr. Horribles Sing Along Blog begins with Dr. Horrible discussing his application to the League of Evil, and through the process, inadvertently introduces his nemesis Captain Hammer to the girl of his dreams, Penny.  It was well done.  Hats off you you Joss!    I always said that I would continue to support these types of media.  When this came out on DVD I was going to buy it regardless, but was pleasantly surprised with the extras included with it.      You won't be dissapointed!

B0014WSWTY|5.0|When I received this set of Beethoven symphonies, I listened first to the disk containing symphonies 6 and 8. I was immediately swept away by the brisk tempos of the Pastoral symphony. No leisurely stroll through the meadows, rather a quick walk through the countryside. Nevertheless, I was captivated by the interpretation. Next, I noticed the glorious sound of the Anima Eterna Symphony orchestra, captured vividly by the recording. Gruff horns, searing strings, and elegant woodwinds intertwined to make a wonderful blend. Instruments would enjoy their moment in the limelight and then combine to frolic together with the other players. The storm was magnificent, given extra emphasis by some frightening percussion playing. I was so captivated that I spent the rest of the week listening to nothing else but this symphony cycle. Not only were each of the symphonies given first-rate performances, the overtures were dramatically characterized as well. The Coriolan Overture was particularly well done. The performances generally offered brisk tempos and dramatic phrasing, with most of the repeats taken.  I confess that I am a sucker for Beethoven symphony cycles, but I would rate this as right up there with my other HIP favorites by Bruggen and Hogwood and other favorite recent cycles by Harnoncourt (not HIP but containing some original instruments and employing some historical playing techniques) and Mackerras.
B000002OX7|5.0|This single CD edition has songs Not found on the Deluxe, Water and I dont even know myself are two examples.<br /><br />This CD from track 1 to the last track is pure rock at its best.<br /><br />One gripe on the remastering.  I have the 1984 CD and it actually has a fuller sound to it, the remastering on songs like \\"Baba O-Riley\\" and \\"Wont Get Fooled Again\\" you can notice that air or static has been removed from the source tapes, but it also flatens the sound, nothing major, but it is noticeable.<br /><br />Buy this CD and digital download the other studio songs from the deluxe edition and you'll have a very excellent compliation of the 1970-71 Who.

B000QCUB8I|3.0|When I'm judging an album, if I'm not initally impressed, I figure on 10 total plays to make a decision.  After 10 plays, \\"Cross\\" still didn't have me feeling one way or another.  After 15 more plays, this album still shows the same - good then bad.     Once things start sounding good, as in the opening track \\"Genesis\\", they quickly turn to bad, in \\"Let There Be Light\\" (This track gives me a headache).  \\"D.A.N.C.E\\" and \\"Newjack\\" are cute and the album kind of wanders through \\"TTHHEE PPAARRTTYY\\" and \\"DVNO\\" with nothing overly impressive.  \\"Waters of Nazareth\\" is a nice track that should have been more towards the beginning of the album and then the album kind of just goes away, wanting me to play it again, and I don't know why.     Overall, not terrible, but not something I'm going to be playing months from now.
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|This movie is a classic! There is great picture transition quality on this dvd and also nice sound. Having read the book, I would say the book is MUCH better and I felt the movie was an edited version of the book. That aside the movie is still a great stand-alone and you should enjoy it even if you haven't read the book. Also to get the special features, flip the disc over and insert it in your dvd player- they're there. All in all I am very pleased. I actually recieved the movie 3 days before I was supposed to...WELL DONE AMAZON.<br />The only reason I give the movie four stars is because the book held so much more for me in the way of character development and sympathy for them although Mother Joad, Granpa, and Casy were terrific in the movie. Muley is wonderful in both the book and the movie (that ol' graveyard ghost - you got to love him), but I'd have to say Henry Fonda didn't do it for me as Tom Joad. It could have been because Hollywood is Hollywood even way back when but, as an example, when Tom (Henry) first sees Mother Joad after getting home from McAllister and the camera gets a pretty-boy close up of his face and it just seems to beam of joyous rapture I felt a slight need to chuckle. I suppose that was how Hollywood sold its stars back then. The last critique about the movie I have was that the ending was totally watered down and was not the much anticipated ending I thought would be offered since I felt it very symbolic to the whole moral of the story anyway. Other than that, I think the movie is worth it.<br /><br />...and you shouldn't worry about hidden socialist or communist messages in the movie. I had read a professional review about the movie from another web source and the reviewer had mentioned that the movie made more of a political statement than the book. What? The only resemblance to any socialistic or communistic ideas I encountered were in the book and that (socialist) was how the authorities treated/policed the migrants and (communist) how Tom tells someone \\"Damn right, I'm Bolshevisky!\\" referring to Bolshevik and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and how the migrants were left with no other choice but to form their own communities if you will. So, for me, I just ignored those pretenses and enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I hope you will too.lls someone \\"Damn right, I'm Bolshevisky!\\" referring to Bolshevik and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and how the migrants were left with no other choice but to form their own communities if you will.

I also like it because I'm not very coordinated so I don't have do any dancey type moves.

B000R8YC18|5.0|[[VIDEOID:30994621]]\\"I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention, I believe that one should become a person like other people.\\" -Travis Bickle<br /><br />The existential musings of an alienated man juxtaposed with that same man's contempt for the filth and corruption he sees all around him make up the heart and soul of \\"Taxi Driver\\".  There are more memorable lines of dialogue in this film that speak of the truths of life than in some entire years' worth of Oscar fare.  \\"You do a thing and that's what you are\\".  Simple. Concise. Easy to understand. Irrefutably true. We are each nothing more than the sum of the things we have said and done.  This is the meaning of life and it's in one throwaway line from a film filled with nearly two hours of genius.  The setting of New York is so quintessentially American that this film would not have worked anywhere else.  There is just something so instantly recognizable and identifiable about that city that every man, woman, and child in America feels like they've lived there even if (like me) they have never even been there.  There simply is no other possible place for Travis Bickle to dwell and it is used to full effect in this film.  Also of note is i9n the movie Cybill Shepherd's hotness.  Her character's overreaction to porn speaks of serious issues, but I suppose when you're that gorgeous you can afford to be prudish.<br /><br />What most people remember from \\"Taxi Driver\\" is the legendary bit where DeNiro stands in front of a mirror and practices taunting an imaginary foe with the iconic line and mannerism that will never die, \\"You talkin' to me?\\".  Influences of the film that I didn't mention in the video include numerous other musical references and homages in film and television.  In an episode of the second season of the cult television series [[ASIN:B0019BI11O Code Monkeys]] (only first season on DVD so far) there was an episode called \\"My Pal Jodie\\" which mocked the controversy surrounding violent video game slike [[ASIN:B000FRU1UM Grand Theft Auto]] by featuring a video game where you play as a man trying to kill a world leader known as \\"Ray-Gun\\" to win Jodie Foster's love.

If that is not a deep work of art, nothing is.<br /><br />This is a movie that will speak to anybody who's found society to be nearly irredeemable, but is still compelled to seek a connection to the people within it.  Go get yourself \\"organizized\\", understand all that is you, and take it to the world at large in the way you see fit.  This character's plan of action is contrary to my very nature and downright psychotic, but as a fictional person in a work of art, his rampage is inspiring in it's purity.  Bickle's missions of choice are very different, but the same in that he seemed to seek to free the two women in his life from the thrall of two very different but in their own way powerful men. Travis may not have accomplished all of his goals in the movie or even consciously known what they were, but in his violent unfocused catharsis he does save the soul of young prostitute even as he abandons his own.  And even doing so in brutal fashion, he at least gains the respect of a woman he loves but will never understand.  Leave it to the media to turn a bloodbath into an act of heroism.<br /><br />The special features on this DVD include two commentaries, some great featurettes with Scorsese talking about his personal experiences, point of view, and goals when he made the film, and plenty more to delve into.

0545128285|3.0|The book was fine.  Don't expect anything too exciting.  The sectins with Dumbledore's commentary are very boring.  You can read the whole thing in a short sitting.  There are only two tales that are even mildly entertaining. The first is the one about the brothers that was in book 7 and the other is the one with the three ladies and the knight and the fountain.  It was an ok read, but really not a very entertaining one.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles's Davis \\"Kind of Blue\\" changed the musical landscape for Bepopper's.  Miles stripped the music down to its bare essentials.  By selecting the best musicians, Coltrane, Evans, Adderly, Chambers, he was able to pulled it off.  If you want to know what jazz is all about Kind of Blue is the album to listen too.  Quite simply it's a classic of the 20th century music.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Woody Allen can never make Manhattan or Annie Hall again. Simply put, the world isn't smart enough for that brand of movie being made. people don't get that way of communicating, studios don't get why anyone would make a movie for the art and so on. Woody himself isn't that person anymore. he is a man in his 70s, and he can't keep stooping these young women. That being said, it could be nice to see him as an old man, married to a woman his own age, in some sort of adventure, not unlike Manhattan Murder Mysteries again, but, what with the US studios not fronting him the cash, I guess he won't make movies where he ties up parts of Manahattan again?<br /><br />All that being said, Woody Allen is timeless, yet he keeps fresh, and keeps up with current actors and so on. His language may at times seem a bit archaic, but I don't think we suffer from hearing people talk properly. The actors he works with adore him and the freedom he offers them. He is an actors director, trusting that they know their craft. That shows, also in this movie.<br /><br />Should you preffer humour and cringe at drama with people behaving in a... sexually embarrassing way,w ell then this is probably not the movie for you.<br /><br />If you love watching movies where the relationship between human beings, with all their beauty, all their faults, desires, cruelty, egotism and horny behaviour out there for all to see, well, then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Sure, Woody doesn't have a real grasp of Europe anno 2008, or for that matter, New York, but I love him for it. The fact that he ignores what people think he should do, and ignores the bland movie making going on these days, and just does his thing. He is my hero, and I am not ashamed to say so.<br /><br />I loved this movie, it was a real shot in the arm for his body of work (I couldn't stand Cassandra's Dream), and I reccomend it warmly.<br /><br />However, my top 3 Woody Allen movies of all time, are still Manhattan, Stardust Memories and Broadway Danny Rose.
B00000JCB2|4.0|. . . but now this album isn't as great as I thought they were back in the days. \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'all\\" was heavy, probably the heaviest album Limp Bizkit has ever released. And it had depressing moments found in songs like \\"Stalemate\\" and \\"Nobody Loves Me\\". Here, the depression is smaller, and the crazy liveliness found in \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" is becoming more constant. I now have mixed feelings about this album. Songs like \\"I'm Broke\\" and \\"Don't Go Off Wandering\\" have that familiar Three Dollar Bill heaviness, which I admire very much. \\"Just Like This\\", \\"N 2 Gether Now\\" and \\"Nookie\\" just don't add up. And \\"No Sex\\" is just downright crappy.<br /><br />In short, this just isn't as good as Limp Bizkit's first album. But it doesn't go downhill from here; it does in \\"Chocolate Starfish.\\"<br /><br />Grade: B-
B0002F6AH0|1.0|How can anyone produce a documentary about the allied campaigns to liberate North Africa, Italy, and France without once mentioning General George S. Patton?  And when the subject turns to the Battle of the Bulge, this documentary presents a Wehrmacht turned back thanks to the heroic efforts of the British led by the ever fearless military genius General Bernard Montgomery.  Patton didn't even merit a footnote, and that's enough for this documentary to get a single star.

0312383320|2.0|This is a MacGyver book.    You know, take several apparently unrelated items, manipulate them just so, and surprise! you get a working solution to a problem.    Trouble is, Janet Evanovich has taken truly ridiculous items, placed them in a bag, shaken them up, and poured them into her word processor; and the result is, well, not very successful.  It's silly bordering on burlesque.    Stephanie Plum is a fine and funny character, and while her regular series is getting a tad long in the tooth, it's still pretty good.  It's usually heavy on the humor and romance, with some occasional violence for good measure.    This book, though, just misfires all over the place.

The plot is epic, enthralling, and will keep you glued to your seat for hours. And its themes are though provoking and challenging.    That said, I cannot recommend this series for everyone. Some will find its take on the secular-religious struggle unsettling or outrageous (read any one-star review from your neighborhood conservative Christian). And I do find the subtle thematic progression to be a distasteful choice: the fantastic plot in the first book lures young readers not yet able to analyze the the series' themes in terms of symbols, metaphor, or abstaction as they become more overt later on in the series.    While it has been called the antithesis to C.S. Lewis' Narnia series (which, by the way, also ought not be read by children until they reach an age where they're ready to interpret the symbolism and hold a few abstract discussions on religion), Pullman comes off not so much as atheist as humanist, condemning organized religion not spiritually, but on a utilitarian scale that weighs heavily against its potential for corruption, social ill, and ability to inflict guilt disproportionate to the fault, and lightly on its potential to work moral good.    If you can handle a mature discussion of the aforementioned topics, I highly recommend this series, and might even suggest a comparative reading of Pullman against Lewis.  Worth a read for the narrative alone if you don't find the themes distasteful, and definitely a strong pick to read for discussion.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|Ok, first of all this entire cd is dedicated to her working out her pain, sorrow, anger and fear of her ending marriage.  So with that in mind, I did find it a bit hard to listen to the whole cd without taking a break.  Now if you find yourself mad or in crappy traffic, then heck this is just the cd to listen to and propel you angrily through traffic.  Its fun at times and a bit much at times but overall a good mix of musical styles and a good time once you get going.  If you enjoyed her last cd, then I dont think youll be disappointed here.  If you didnt know she was getting divorced before you listen, you sure will after!
1592332803|2.0|I should have spent more time looking at the ingredients in recipes instead of allowing myself to be swept away by the awesome pictures.  I was expecting more creative thinking than just replacing milk with soy milk, eggs with an egg replacement powder and real butter with soy margarine.  Any one can take the baking recipes they already own and make these substitutions.  You don't need this book to do it for you.  I was hoping for recipes that made ample use of natural sweeteners like agave nectar or dates - that had more wholesome substitutions for white flour or even whole wheat flour.  I suppose this book is good for someone who is just beginning to think about becoming a Vegan but needs to stay close to what he or she knows in order to be comfortable trying a change.    We tried the chocolate chip cookie recipe.  You can't eat these warm out of the oven.  They're grease pits and gross.  Yet, the next day they were delicious.  For me, that was just too weird.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Incredible workout.  I am on day 3 and feel the burn and  the OUCH factor.  I feel sore in places on my muscles I haven't felt in years when I use to put in hours at the gym.    I do LEVEL I and II consecutively.    Level 1  kicked my butt so hard the first day, I had to take the next day off.  I could barely walk up and down my stairs in my house.    I am a busy mother of two and use to think that cardio ( I run)  was all I needed, but you need strength training and abs too.   The workouts are perfect 20 plus minutes (about 25) and have a perfect combination of cardio, strength, abs and cooldown.  She provides an advance exercise move  and beginner exercise move on all her levels with her two partners in the video. If a move is too much for you, you can use the modified version until you master it.      I am truly a fan of Jillian and I appreciate a no nonsense DVD, no hype, just hardcore exercise.       I highly recommend this.  I expect by the time the 30 days is up, I will see a big change.  I will continue to use this DVD in my exercise regime.        ALL you need for the workout is some hand weights and a mat (if you have a hard surface) Thats it!

B0009XNUK0|4.0|As far as \\"essential\\" compilations go, you'd be hard pressed to find a more stellar collection of hits than this. However, like most greatest hits CDs, there always seem to be one or two omissions that really should have been included. The five most glaring cuts: \\"Dancing Machine,\\" \\"Working Day and Night,\\" \\"State of Shock,\\" \\"Scream\\" and \\"Break of Dawn.\\"     All that aside, you're still left with the goods from Mr. Jackson's most celebrated albums, \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad.\\" Sure, it would've been nice had \\"This Place Hotel\\" been thrown in to the mix, but with the stuff from both the Jackson 5 and The Jacksons included, this is a pretty sweet deal for the price.    I was fortunate enough to come across the limited edition 3.0, which includes a third disc featuring the songs:  Can't Get Out of the Rain  Say, Say, Say (with Paul McCartney)  Jam  They Don't Care About Us  Blood On the Dance Floor  Stranger In Moscow   and Butterflies

006112429X|5.0|This book amazed me. I started it and it wasn't long until I found myself hating all the characters and the whole book very depressing. However, Shriver's incredible writing, I mean how many people can hold attention just through a series of letters?  Through her writing I couldn't let go of the book.  I found the ending very strong and I was very moved.  It made me think a lot about my own relationship with my son.  This was a truly great book!

0070511136|5.0|EVERYONE who sells or studies sales knows about SPIN questioning.<br /><br />There can be a problem when an idea or term is ubiquitous: it becomes almost generic or commonplace. Everyone who has had a sales class -- at least mine -- can list the words that comprise the acronym. But it is valuable to return to the original source for insights.<br /><br />It was a pleasure to recently re-read SPIN Selling. Rackman does a fine job of summarizing the results of a massive sales research effort. Anyone who has been a salesperson or has taught professional selling must be amused by his anecdote on p. 25 about a salesperson who diligently followed the closing procedure that he had been taught: (see if you can identify each type of close attempted!)<br /><br />.....<br /><br />Salesperson: So, Mr. Robinson, you can see that our product is clearly best for you -- if you just sign here.<br /><br />Mr. R: Just a minute -- I don't see...  I haven't decided.<br /><br />Salesperson: But Mr. Robinson, I've shown you how we can improve the efficiency of your office and save you trouble and also money -- so if you can decide when you'd like delivery...<br /><br />Mr. R: I'll do no such thing.  I'm not making a decision this week.<br /><br />Salesperson: But as I've explained, this model is in great demand. I can let you have one now, but if you wait for next week, there could be a several month delay.<br /><br />Mr. R: That's risk that I will have to take...<br /><br />Salesperson: Would you prefer a month's trial installation, or would be better for your budget to buy outright?<br /><br />Mr. R: I'm going to throw you out of my office.  Tell me, would you and your friends in the corner prefer to go of your own accord, or would you like me to call security.<br /><br />.....<br /><br />There are good stories and insights on every page. It is fascinating to understand how SPIN questions evolved.<br /><br />This book should be on the shelf of every student of sales.
B000002I6X|5.0|dont know why i didnt have this part of Stephen Stills work. it sums up my feelings about this era of music. if it werent for the Beatles, stephen, David Crosby, Graham Nash, and Neal Young, would have been the kings of that era. it of course was a different approach to music all together and apart from the Beatles. just listen to \\" The Last Time Around\\" by of course Buffalospringfield, and compare it with any Beatle album of that time, and you will get the picture. this is not a put down of any Beatles music of the time or any time, their work is still stricking!!! but just for a moment whisper to yourself,\\" What if they weren`t there????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\\"
B001ED7C58|5.0|well, unlike most people here, I never read the books. I saw the movie by accident as I was trying to see Australia for the 3rd time but tickets had sold out. Even if that weren't true, when I know a movie is based upon a book I always watch the movie first. For the simple reason that EVERYONE ALWAYS says the book was better. If you see the movie first, you never get disapointed, believe me, I've been at it for countless years.    So, the soundtrack didn't disapoint me in any way and it's fitted in a super smart way through the movie so that it doesn's take any of the lighness and poetry out of it, even though on it's own it's sounds heavy. I think the way they put it just gave the right amount of seriousness that otherwise would completely be gone from a movie. The actors do a great job, but without a narrator (wich sounds preety annoying) there's no way to set the mood as well as in a book without music.    Perfect score and Bella's lullaby is gorgeous! I dunno how it's depicted on the book but if this wasn't to the author's liking she would've said so. She was really happy with the result so i'd say they didn't deviate from her ideas.    PS: the song and the shooting effects they used on the baseball scene actually made me enjoy baseball for the first time in my life! lol!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Anyone who thinks that Donna Summer has had her day should think again. The third single release from this album - Fame (The Game)which is easily the best track on the album - has just hit the top of the American Dance Charts. That meeans all three singles from this album have topped the American Dance Chart. Bearing in mind how many tracks are released PURELY for this chart makes Donna's accomplishment all the more remarkable.<br /><br />There is not a duff track on this album. As another reviewer pointed out, this album could easily be mistaken for her Greatest Hits album. Whilst a lot of artists who have been around as long as she has are churning out mediocre material, Donna Summer has once again done her legions of fans around the world proud. The fact that she has dedicated this album to her fans makes her all the more wonderful.<br /><br />With this album, I have managed to convert many of my friends, who were only casual fans, into super fans. I bought my partner a copy of this and it spent six months in their car stereo.<br /><br />It's a well known fact that in England we don't get much of a summer.....well I live in England and my SUMMER (just like the title of one of her earlier greatest hits packages) remains ENDLESS!!!!!
0596522347|2.0|I rarely review books, but this one was such a waste that I'd feel guilty if I didn't at least TRY to persuade you not to buy. The main problem with the book, as other reviewers have alluded to, is that it sort of tries to BE a design masterpiece rather than teach you. The design is interesting, but it is to the point that the content is subordinated to the design. There are maybe 5 pages worth of useful content.    Another irritant to me is that this is by far the most commercial book I've ever seen (more ads than a magazine). It seemed that every few pages I was being told to buy this book, or buy all of some other guys books. There is a two page section that is taken from Guy Kawasaki's blog. The whole thing is incredibly derivative (but shallow).    Finally, and this I can take responsibility for, it didn't meet my needs because I am not Al Gore, nor am I the CEO of a company. If I gave a presentation in the style of this book I'd be laughed out of the office. I'm an analyst, and the warm and fuzzy slides would not be good. Duarte's advice on data intensive slides? \\"Both [of Stephen Few's] books should be on your shelf along with everything Edward Tufte has written.\\"  I have two Tufte books and they are virtually identical, I don't see myself buying his others (and they suffer from the same lack of relevance to corporate analysts). Disappointing.

B001H5X7JS|1.0|I expected this to be campy, but it was just way over the top.  Jack Black plays Jack Black.  Ben Stiller plays the Zoolander (again).  Robert Downey Jr. plays a black man and is convincing and interesting, except I couldn't understand half of what he said.  Tom Cruise is surprisingly funny and Matthew McConaughey is good.<br /><br />But the movie is just stupid.  The premise is funny, and I knew the premise going in - prima-donna actors doing a film on Viet Nam go off-set and think they are still filming a movie when they get caught up in a drug lord operation and are under real attack.<br /><br />But it is poorly executed and just over the top camp.<br /><br />I'm clearly in the minority here, so as a guide to others let me say that if you like Zoolander then this movie is for you.  But if you prefer your humor to be a little more intelligent then this will let you down.
B001DF68MA|3.0|Obviosuly the concept is great. But for us it did not work out that well. First probelm is that our 1 1/2 year old was to big/tall. When we first unpacked the seat we were astonished how small the seat is, at least to us the seat is tiny, in reality that is all that is needed and the design maybe on purpose inorder for the person to bicylce comfortable without it being too much in the way. But even still we found it uncomfortable to go for any longer trips than say a quick ride.    We have instead purchased the COPILOT LIMO rear child seat. And it has worked out very well, and out child has room to grow so the product will have a longer life span as well as able to go for longer rides more comfortably. We had the same reservations that anyone would have about the rear child seat, but this particular model COPILOT seems very stable and since we bicylce together our child can see the other parent as we ride together.
0316017922|1.0|I picked up this book because it's not that thick and it has so many good reviews.  However, the book taught me a lesson that the thickness of the book has nothing to do with the ease and the speed of reading, and that \\"popularity\\" has nothing to do with \\"good content\\"....  The book was so boring and was so tedious in all those \\"outliner\\" stories that it made me fall asleep constantly. I knew it was going to be a lousy book after I read the introduction, cause it was so boring and tedious and the introduction sounded pretty irrelevant to \\"success\\" which is the topic of the book....The author was forcing a link of relevancy by saying at the end of the introduction.... \\"The value of the world you inhabit and the people you surround yourself with make you the person you are....\\" something like that.... So all of a sudden, I got this after I read all the boring mumbles about the health issue in a small town up in Pennsylvania, and then the book began its first chapter about \\"success\\", only it didn't get any better, cause I found myself reading another boring mumbling chapter about some Canadian Hocky Team and its  scoring history and the long tedious tables of birthdays and names and hit/miss (whatever the game calls it) records of the teammates....Again, what was the point of this book? Teaching me how to appreciate Hocky?  Chapter after chapter, there are more boring long stories that the author forcibly made them connect to  the book's topic on \\"how people become successful\\". I totally felt like a loser just by buying this book and even felt  more like a loser by reading it. I should have tossed it away and not cared so much about the money I paid for it.  \\"Money can't buy time\\".  My dad told me over and over when I was a kid, and obviously, I hadn't learnt.  So forget about the book, some of the things we need to become successful are, \\"not to follow the crowd\\", \\"value our time\\" , \\"be able to cut our losses before more loss or damage is incurred\\" , \\"always learn our lessons and remember them\\".  Guess this book did teach me something afterall....<br /><br />Feel like this book is a ripped off... It can be summarized into the following:  Combinations of factors that contribute to success are complicated and diversed... can be luck, can be your family, can be your school, can be just your birth place or your birthdays... etc etc.... (so does that mean the author himself doesn't quite know what the exact formula to becoming successful is? So he wrote a book just to explain why he doesn't know and nobody can possibly know the exact factors that make people successful??? Cause they can be uncontrollable, or predetermined... or whatever...), but according to the author, you can still make it thru hardwork and perseverance.... Doesn't this sound familiar?  So all the tedious mumble jumble outliner stories that torture me many evenings all boiled down to this.  Now if you want to be successful, don't be like me, stay away from this book, go watch a movie, try out a new restaurant, arrange a date with your spouse or someone you like.... go to a concert... but never stay home and read this book like I did.lessons and remember them\\".

B000KIRT6A|1.0|I bought this pedal for my guitarist friend... wait let's start from the beginning.  Shortly before Christmas I purchased the Behringer Bass Graphic Equalizer, for myself.  It worked once, and then would only emit a terrible high pitched buzzing.  I ordered my guitarist friend this pedal before I had received mine.  He received his, and I returned mine, and received a refund.    He attends school on the opposite side of the state from me, and when he returned home he tried the pedal.  As in my case, it worked for him the first time, and then would only emit said high pitched buzzing.  We both own Behringer Vintage Delay pedals, and they seem fine.    However, I would stay FAR away from their equalizers.

Very heavy duty and fits right up against the wall. We are very pleased.
B001IUG3CU|4.0|Much better than the last album. I've been an AC/DC fan for a long time, and this is much better than \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\". They finally went back closer to their roots, and worked with Johnson's vocals better.
B000003CMB|3.0|I bought this CD because it's the only one of their CD's that I know of that has \\"Stormy Monday\\" on it. Unfortunately, several of the other tracks sound to me like so much stoned out, mindless meandering on lead guitar; kind of boring and amateurish. \\"Stormy Monday\\" lives up to the Allman Brothers name, though.
B001IU8RWY|5.0|A great album! Much better than their last effort. The title track is by far the best track on the album. I just wish they would give it more airtime. But do not take away from the rest of the tracks: They are great also. The band seems to have finally gotten back to their earlier blues-influenced sound.
0312360266|4.0|Admittedly deeper than my last read (Glass Houses by Rachel Caine), it's still in the same basic genre that I felt like reading at this time. Even though Zoey is a bit of a Mary-Sue character (practically perfect in every way), I still liked her, and it probably helped it was written in first person so that I could read her insecurities and such. I loved the basic plot and the side characters, Damien and Stevie Rae (oh, and Nala!) were great. On the other hand, I could probably do without the 'Twins,' but beggars can't be choosers. :P If I had read this as a teenager, I know I would have loved it even more than I do. The book reminded me of Laurie Faria Stolarz's books; it had the same basic feel to it as those do, even if it's totally different in concept.<br /><br />The book could have done another editing sweep. I had to reread many sentences so they would make sense to me. Now, I don't know if it's because I'm not that up on teenage slang. Now, I'm not that old, but old enough to not know every slang word or phrase. For example, there is a sentence that reads: \\"Just please with the taking so long.\\" Now what is that supposed to mean? To me it sounds like it's two unfinished sentences stuck together. Hopefully, there won't be too much pop culture thrown into the series, because more often than not, it dates the book and doesn't really add anything. Nitpicking aside, I honestly can't wait to explore more of this world.
B0019CB5T8|5.0|You have two camps of people with this film.  Some knock it totally saying it is in no way a horror movie.  Others see it for what it is.  It has never been called a horror film .  It has a presence of horror in a different way and is a true story that is more a courtroom drama that explores how the legal system deals with the case of a girl who died after an exorcism and while under the direct care of a priest.  Was she epileptic and psychotic?  Or was she possessed.  Medical facts verses spiritual facts.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST was a story that had the exorcism and gore galore in the forefront with the story of its characters in the background.  THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is about an exorcism with the strong story in the forefront.  This is a 5 star film.  We have three of the best actors of this decade - Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson and Scott Campbell.  These are hardcore actors and each tackles their role with strong intensity.<br /><br />Now before I continue I want to comment on how the film appears in blu ray.  It is absolutely astounding.  The 1080p high def picture is crystal clear and the truehd audio will blow you away.  This must be viewed with a 5.1 theater system.  I have seen this film many times and the clarity in blu ray makes the courtroom scenes seem as if I am watching a play and the actors are in my room.  The film does manage to expertly show the progression of Emily Rose's deterioration and if you view it with blu ray and a theater system the sound will have you on the edge of your seat and jumping out of your skin.  (Important note, if you watch DEXTER, it is great fun to see Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose.  She is superb.)<br /><br />Blu ray allows the viewer to see the emotions of the actos much more clearly.  Laura Linney is the attorney defending the priest accused of Emily's death and she is at first a self professed agnostic.  But the film is largely about how the whole affair affects her.  At the end she is very troubled and doesn't know what she is.  But her life is totally changed.  Even with all the great acting the film in my opinion belongs to Laura Linney and Jennifer Carpenter.<br /><br />If you want a standard B horror film with blood and gore this film is not for you.  This film is an insightful, intelligent courtroom drama about a very unique case and it is scary, suspenseful, troubling and dramatic but for different reasons.  Excellent film and even if you own the dvd you MUST purchase it on blu ray.  It is a demonstration of blu ray at its best.r life is totally changed.

1932100660|5.0|I couldn't believe what a page turner I found this to be, but Campbell's writing style was very readable, and the sheer weight of the data and its implications made it amazing to me that this information isn't more widely known. I had heard info from Dr. Ornish and McDougall in programs and articles, and I knew Oprah had been sued for saying she was cutting out beef, but that was about it. Even if correct, I thought The China Study might seem like someone selectively choosing data to suit an agenda. In fact, I think Campbell ended up finding the opposite of what he started out expecting.<br /><br />Reading the book and checking the 35 pages of small print of reputable sources, I was amazed at how much research over so many years has shown that changing diet can slow and even reverse disease. That even if you are exposed to carcinogens or have a genetic predisposition, you can still affect your outcome with diet. It makes sense to me - seeing that Americans have such a high incidence of diseases that we almost consider inevitable, and yet some other parts of the world have much lower statistics for the same problems. And also knowing that migrants end up taking on the risks of the diets found in the countries to which they move.<br /><br />It's a good thing that diet can help reverse disease, because I'm guessing most people won't think seriously about their eating habits  until they get some bad news. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, suddenly we became avid readers of information about every kind of treatment and about diet. And diet is one of the easiest things for us to take control of at a time when things feel completely out of control. I hope this book helps more people slow the progress, and even prevent the onset, of diseases like cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. I also hope school lunches will someday at least include more whole plant foods like brown rice and leafy vegetables to help the next generation.<br /><br />If there was one thing I'd change it would be the title of the book. Many, many studies are mentioned here, and the China Study, though huge, is only one.the title of the book. Many, many studies are mentioned here, and the China Study, though huge, is only one.

B000XYNFD2|5.0|I bought this watch even though I had the Japan movement version already and have had it for two years. This watch is visually very similar to the Rolex Submariner, in fact other than the name on the dial it looks practically identical, without trying to be a replica.     Anyway when I opened the box and compared it to the 100.00 Japanese version the differences were astonishing. I have read a review somewhere on this watch, (maybe on Amazon)where the reviewer states that it is more polished, well made, and substantial than the Rolex. Having seen the Rolex and now this watch, I would not disagree. It is simply beautifully made. I have seven or eight watches and usually switch off every day but since I got this watch I have worn it constantly.     It feels like a piece of jewelry and the finish is flawless. Also it keeps very accurate time, and does indeed have a Swiss movement as far as I can see. Very nice box also.

B001DJ7PNW|2.0|A total work of fiction and a sham. 'JFK' is the lie perpetrated on the American people. It has contributed to the nonsense that there was a conspiracy - it is convincing when it presents the 'facts' but this film is full of errors. Also, as an artistic film, the strength of the story / emotional drama etc... is carried by the gravity of the evidence / material but one you realize this is all a fake and a Hollywood bastardization of the truth it falls apart factually and artistically.    This film has more holes than a wicker canoe. True, some of the evidence was 'gospel' when the film was made but many errors and half truths made it into the film as absolute fact. Some examples:  -Oswald was a lousy shot: in truth he was an expert shot and a sharpshooter - they even have his shooting tests from the military  -3 shots in 6 seconds - it wasn't. It was 8.3 seconds, and it's easy (time-wise)  -the head back and to the left - the wound evidence that Cyril Wecht has made a career out of criticizing is conclusive that he was shot from the rear. Conservation of momentum shows that if a huge heavy chunk of head moves away at high speed that the body will move in the opposite direction - in fact ANY direction is possible depending on the entry and where the fragments blow out  -the magic spinning bullet - anyone with 2 eyes who has really looked at the Zapruder film can see that when that shot was fired that Connelly was sitting lower than JFK, towards the middle of the car, and sharply turned - not sitting square and facing forward as shown in the film - when you connect the lines it make a perfect straight line  -the pristine bullet - it was not pristine, the groove pattern matched the rifle, PROVING it was fired by the rifle found in the book depository and there are missing fragments that were found in Connolly.  -I don't remember if it was in the film, but the microphone evidence has all been disproved    Also, Garrison's testimony in the real case relied ona  witness who admitted he never saw Clay Shaw, Ferry and Oswald together - when asked under a polygraph yes or no, he said 'well if you ask me yes or no, it would have to be a no'    Garrison suborned perjury in this case - that seems clearer and clearer over time. We don't want to accept that this dysfunctional insignificant human being who even the soviets got bored of (and realized he was useless as a piece of propaganda and sent him back) could possibly have cut down such a great historical figure. We don't WANT to believe that, but it is true. Garrison makes him out to be a hero double agent! For God's sake, this guy was a personality disorder whose only double agent work was trying to act tough and be a commie wanna-be who would annoy anti-Castro Cubans then later appear on TV to advocate Marxism. He was an attention hound ! The 60s weren;t today - not everybody got on TV looking for 15 minutes of fame like today - you had to try hard... He would constantly mix himself up with these people to stir the pot like all dysfunctional personality disorders who live off the reaction they create in others. That's why everyone think he's tied up in some conspiracy - because of the company he kept, his changing positions etc...but in reality he was playing people for reactions. It's pathetic, really.    So save your money and watch any of the excellent documentaries that tear this apart entirely. And don't (like me) waste any money on 'The Men WHo Killed Kennedy' documentary from the UK either - more pseudo-science with a deep british narrator's voice which is also full of errors and omissions and even wilder theories than in 'JFK'    People like pathologist Wecht have done a huge disservice further stirring this pot. Sure the gov't has screwed up aspects of the investigation and autopsy etc.. Show me anything they get right!    It's time to stop this nonsense once and for all - don't waste your money on the upteenth reissue of this dog of a film and make Stone ever richer than healready is. Look for a book or documentary that tells you the real story.     So, yawn, this is all phony Hollywood melodrama. Shame on you Oliver Stone - I used to believe this because the film was convincing, but now that we know it's all fake you should issue an apology to the nation. Fool me once shame on you, twice? shame on me - time to set it straight...
B0018QCXH8|5.0|The first time I saw this film, I liked it.  The second time, I loved it.  The third and fourth time I loved it more and more, and it has easily earned a spot on my top 3 movies of all time - arguably #1.    As much as I liked No Country For Old Men, I feel this movie was better.  A lot of people argue that it's \\"slow\\", and that \\"nobody talks for the first half hour\\" (which isn't true, it's only about 15 minutes).  These people went in expecting a popcorn film, and that's not what it is at all.  It's a character study, and a damn fine one at that.      Everything about the film in superb.  The acting, the direction, and the overall pace.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is probably 12 years old or would rather watch fighting robots on screen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Committed to other shows when originally airing on FOX..I passed this one over. I adore Nathan Fillion and found myself taking the chance purchasing the entire series recently.  I can not begin to express the genius of Joss Whedon. Now for some..this set might not be to their like'n. To those open-minded individuals..this set is not to be missed. I found myself compelled to watch the entire series within a few days..desiring more. The characters all had their own unique charm which pulled together a precision ensemble cast. The episode content was well executed. The music just added a sense of purity to the series. The feature film \\"Serenity\\" satisfied a minute satisfaction of closure. The show needs a new revival.  Watching the special features proves that there was a fan base.  Someone step up and take hold of this phenomenon..so that it may take flight once again.  Kudos..Joss Whedon..Kudos.

1400079276|5.0|Having never heard of Murakami prior to the publication of Kafka on the Shore, I resisted purchasing it time and again. After all, it does not follow that simply because one employs a particularly beloved signifier in a title, that the object signified by said title accrues some metaphysical value, which is not credited to texts bereft of such clever strategies. Indeed, one must be quite bold to actually invoke \\"Kafka\\" before many who will examine and possibly read it has any other experience of one's work. As it turns out, Murakami is absolutely justified in his appropriation of Kafka's name in title of this wondrous work of imaginative brilliance.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the very real and significant contributions Freud made to our understanding to the workings of the mind, I maintain that his true claim to fame is as the greatest mythologist of the 20th century, especially in his later writings, and most especially in his books dealing with the socio-political foundations of society--The Future of an Illusion & Totem and Taboo come to mind--and commentary on such relations, which are found throughout his work. In order to walk away from these amazing books having gained anything of value, one has to be willing to give Freud a certain amount of artistic license and suspend disbelief. Having done so, the payoff is immense. For example, I found  that The Future of an Illusion is a perfect way to off-set Aristotle, J. S. Mill, and old Manny Kant, in that it offers a such a radically different account of the foundations of and motivation to morality that students must rethink all of the theories from beginning to end. (I don't use Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morals for reasons of temporal economy.)<br /><br />A similar act of faith is the very condition of the possibility of reading much more than 15 pages of this work of shockingly expansive imagination. As something of a fetishist for magical realism, I am more than prepared to have characters give birth to cats, dance with the devil, and defy the never questioned convention that holds that nature is ruled by certain unbreakable laws, such as gravity, when, in fact, the strongest claim that we can make as to the continuation gravity's felicitous effects is that they have not failed to obtain to this point in human history, as far as we know. I must say, however, that neither de Bernieres (I am thinking not of Corelli's Mandolin, but of his early trilogy, which elaborates the history of the fantastic village of Cochadebajo, which is in the same metaphysical neighborhood as the village to which Kafka Tamura, the title character as you will have guessed, travels in seeking to achieve what Nietzsche calls the most difficult task: becoming what one is.)nor Borges, Bulgakov (The Master and Margarita) nor Allende, not even Garcia Marquez,the Master himself, prepared me in the least for what lay ahead in Kafka on the Shore.<br /><br />Frankly, Murakami is in a league all his own. He requires not simply that we suspend disbelief, but that, in addition, we suspend all belief as well. In order to fully enjoy such an adventure as he has created in Kafka on the Shore, it is necessary that we do everything we can to approach the text with a tabula rosa. The less we know--or, shall I say ironic as this combination of words may appear, the less we believe ourselves to know, the more receptive we will be to the actuality of the work of art that is in front of us.<br /><br />There are plenty of talented, even brilliant writers. There are even quite a few whose talents reach far beyond a technical competence for putting a story together in a coherent and compelling fashion, but I have never encountered a writer with the temerity of Murakami. Kafka on the Shore would be just as easily at home in a class introducing metaphysics, specifically regarding time and identity, as in a survey of postmodern or contemporary fiction. Indeed, I would have hesitated not to give it a double classification Literature/Philosophy were I a publisher more interested in veracity than in the philosophy of money.<br /><br />One could easily write a book on Murakami's theory of time, the profound elaborations of which I have not seen the likes of since Faulkner's Oh, Jerusalem I Forget Thee, or Wild Palms. Likewise, there is an entire physics of identity, which lay at the heart of the book. One, moreover, which is rather Freudian, to say the least. For as it turns out, Kafka seeks nothing more than to avoid his father's curse that he will be murdered by Kafka, who will then sleep with this mother and his sister: Aeschylus by the Shore just does not have the right ring to it.<br /><br />Starting off from this premise--of which the reader remains ignorant well into the text--Kafka, who is 15, runs away from home and by virtue of a force no more under the power of his will than pure contingency, he ends up in Takamatsu. As serendipity would have it, this is the very same town to which Mr. Nakata, who has murdered Kafka's father--ignoring the fact that he somehow deposits bloody evidence some distance away from the scene of the crime, where Kafka happens to have blacked out--also eventually travels. Mr. Nakata is  one of the more interesting characters in literary history. He is not very smart, not being able to read or write, but he has the singular ability to converse with cats. That is, until he encounters Johnny Walker; whether Mr. Walker is red, black, or blue we have no indication. Suffice it to say that Colonel Sanders is dealing in something more than 12 original herbs and spices these days; though the women for whom he serves as pimp are spicier than anything one may find on one's fried hen, if the example we are introduced to is any indication. Yet, he remains a friend to the community and not simply a trafficker in sex, for without him neither Kafka, Mr. Nakata, nor any number of secondary characters would be able to fulfill their destinies.<br /><br />So, are you following me? No? Good, then you have some idea, however penurious and nebulous, of what it  is like to take a trip to the shore in the mind of Haruki Marakami. Hell, Kafka reads like Kant when placed beside this fantastic phantasmagoric writer the internal logic of whose book is unimpeachable. And this is perhaps the most stunning feat of all the various and sundry Enquirer like activiities that occur in the novel; this most impossible narrative turns out to have been obeying the laws of (dia)logical formations from the very beginning. Though it takes far longer to comprehend this than it does in your average everyday ontologically unstable narrative, the events of the story have unfolded according to a certain necessity, which was laid out from the very first pages: absolutely stunning!<br /><br />In short, I recommend this intellectual adventure to everyone who thinks it exciting to think differently than one did the day before, and is willing to continue to have one's thinking evolve to the point of devolution. Fortunately, and perhaps this is the true gift that Murakami possesses, the author takes us time and time to the edge of reason and sense, only to pull us back just when we have been convinced that it may be  best, if we were to go ahead and plunge body and mind into the abyss. Indeed, for those whose intellectual promiscuity is somewhat more reckless than the average homo sapien, it would be difficult not to feel let down at having been teased with the possibility of a beautifully transgressive literary experience, were it not for the fact that the next available opportunity for trying on a novel identity is found on the very next page or sooner. I do, however, have one rather serious warning; Kafka on the Shore is not for herd animals or for anyone who believes that syllogistic logic is the be all and end all of human intellectual achievemenet, which really amount to the same thing, when one thinks about it. Long live narrative and ontological uncertainty! Long live Haruki Murakami!ver penurious and nebulous, of what it  is like to take a trip to the shore in the mind of Haruki Marakami.

B001HIJYR4|5.0|Wow, Angelina Jolie as an assassin.  What a creative idea.  This a truly great action movie for 2008.  I was more entertained by this movie than any other I've seen this year.  The plot was so devious and cunning, I didn't see suprise coming.  The movie was great, with the special effects and action sequenses.  All I can say is \\"WOW, what a movie\\".  Although Ms. Jolie looked anorexic, it's the movie that draws and keeps your attention.  I hope we see more of this style of movie in the future.
B001CTA1S4|5.0|Doubt is another adaptation from a play of the same title. And it is as breathtaking as the play.<br /><br />The premise circles around doubts the three main character had among each other and the doubt on what is faith, love and care. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is an old school nun who believes in old values and old ways of life. New inventions, including ball point pens are making people losing their disciplines in life by finding an easy way out. In come Sister James (Amy Adams) who displays a committing passion for teaching the new generation. She is young and has strong compassion for her students. On the other side is the unconventional priests loved by the congregation who uses ball point pens (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and believes that the church must move on with the congregation to retain their faith in the church.<br /><br />No doubt these characters clashed with each other - all out of good intend - but then became a tug-of-war that brought the peaceful parish into intellectual intrigues. Who knew the Bible better could no longer be proved to be a sure winner and everyone needed to pull out all the tricks they have under their sleeves.<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman proved that their Oscars in the past are well deserved. The subtleties, the mind games and their confrontations are so gripping that you just couldn't take your eyes off the screen. It has been quite some time that a confrontation done only through dialogues and out-witting without any physical actions have been so breath taking and rings in your head even after you left the theatre. This is great theatre brought on to the silver screen. And these two Oscar winners just did the transition perfectly. Amy Adams tried very hard but she is up again two legends, so she is on very disadvantageous grounds. But she managed to pull out a fair game to show that she is more than a happy chanting princess in \\"Enchanted\\". Another memorable scene is the confrontation between the student's mother (played by Viola Davis) and Sister Aloysius. The dynamics of trusting and doubting and the revelation of new information that tips the balance of power to and fro was just spectacular. Viola Davis put on one hack of a performance against Meryl Streep as she starts to doubt her own motives and trust in people.<br /><br />The movie is not very colourful and the colour scheme made you feel that the sky is always overcast and clouds are always above you. The movie also uses a lot of metaphors with storms and wind to demonstrate the unrest inside a supposedly devoted single faith community. That atmosphere was great throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />If you are looking for a movie that tells a good story with great actors. Without a doubt, Doubt will keep you very satisfied. There aren't a lot of physical actions as everything is played through the dialogue. However, this is what made this move / play great.Viola Davis) and Sister Aloysius.

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|This is a delightfully nutjob film for lovers of Matrix-like CGI effects, based on an equally out-there comic book series by Mark Millar. Wesley Gibson, a put-upon accountant, is such a nonentity he gets zero hits on Google. Then he's recruited by the Fraternity, a millennium-old organization of assassins that takes its jobs from the tapestry of Fate, to succeed his father, a true super-assassin. Wesley learns his lessons the hard, bloody way, eventually reaching nearly unstoppable status, before being assigned to take out Cross, who has betrayed the Fraternity. But (naturally) all is not what it seems, the Good Guys are really the Bad Guys, and Wesley is suddenly on his own. And he wants vengeance. James McAvoy is pretty good as Wesley and Morgan Freeman is pretty good as the boss assassin, and Angeline Jolie (why do people think she's so gorgeous, anyway?) is the semi-love interest. Don't expect it to all make sense. Just sit back with your beer and popcorn and enjoy the mayhem. I mean, . . .  exploding rats? Groovy!
B000001FQQ|4.0|While this is far from Kiss' best studio album; Destroyer and Creatures hold those titles, Hot In the Shade is by far the best of the Non-Makeup years.  Going for a more vintage sound without totally diving into a carbon copy of their self-titled debut.      During the 80's Kiss basically bounced back and forth.  There was The Elder; good album, but disliked by most fans. Creatures; Amazing album that was their heaviest to date.  Lick It Up; Good, but a disappointing follow-up to Creatures.  Animalize; Ok, Gene's songs totally stunk.  Asylum; again ok, and again Gene drops the ball.  Crazy Nights; Dreadful, over produced and their weakest song writing.    So when they returned with Hot In The Shade, I was not only pleased to see a much longer album (15 songs compared to the usual 9), but the album is pretty much listenable from start to finish.  Stand out tracks are Hide Your Heart (Paul rocks this, where as mangled it), Forever, You Me to Hate You, and Betrayed.  The production was much more raw sounding compared to the 3 over polished albums that proceeded it.  If only they could have continued on this streak for Revenge; an album that as much as I want to like it, I just can't get into save for a couple songs.

A SINGER-ACTRESS, like Barbara Streisand, or Madonna, either one of who can act as well as sing... whatever happened to Antonio Banderas, why wasn't he in this movie?     And Merryl Streep is NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR, for this silly movie... and Kate Blanchett is NOT nominated for an Oscar... that's Hollywood justice for you.    I give it two stars... I can't give it less, because I love the ABBA songs, anyways... even with BAD SINGERS the songs come through.  But it really is a toss-up between 1 and 2 stars, and I was lenient.

Set all your camera flash settings as usual for your flash situation attach the unit to your camera and use it to eliminate shades when shutting at day time. Since the unit is slightly higher that the camera built in unit, you will not create lens shade on your subject. I believe this is a better deal than the Sunpak RD-2000.

0810970686|5.0|If your fourth grader reads this book, he'll be ready for the worst to come in Middle School . . . and be able to laugh at it all when it arrives.<br /><br />It's very awkward to be in Middle School. Bigger kids are either tripping you (or worse) or you are afraid you'll be embarrassed by something (almost anything!). Jeff Kinney gets it right.<br /><br />One of the major story lines is that Greg wants Holly Hills to notice he's alive. But like most boys that age, it's hard for him to do anything other than wish to be with her. Everyone who was ever a boy that age will remember going through what Greg is.<br /><br />Another major story line involves Greg being expected to do his own laundry (which means NOT doing any laundry . . . and wearing dirty clothes). Reading that section brought back memories of the aroma of my unwashed gym clothes in eighth grade.<br /><br />There's a seemingly innocent story line about neighbors who want to shoot a funny video that turns out to have more potential than I would have expected.<br /><br />Greg's dad also wants to toughen him up . . . to make a man out of him. And Greg will do anything to avoid that! All boys who prefer video games to hiking will relate to these stories.<br /><br />Greg has his usual complaints about Rodrick and Manny, but they are so expected that you'll feel like you could have written those parts.<br /><br />I liked the part, too, where Greg decides to write a book. There is also a funny section about writing a four-page paper that may inspire youthful imitation.<br /><br />As with the earlier books, the illustrations are great. The printing also makes it seem a little more like a diary (except that such a boy's diary would never be this neat).<br /><br />I had fun, recalled lots of my youthful moments, remembered similar circumstances my boys went through, and laughed aloud quite a lot. What more can a book do? It's a winner!

B00122Z5RI|4.0|I saw the Sex Pistols on their Filthy Lucre Reunion tour and spent my teenage years obsessed with them.    The truth of the matter, once you get past the sheer audacity of their music (and maybe that is its most important contribution), is probably the same thing your parents told you before yelling to turn down that noise - they can barely play their instruments, johnny can't sing, the songs all sound the same, and the lyrics are obvious in their intent to offend parents. The Sex Pistols, when it comes down to it, are ultimately more famous for their antics and their unique fashion sense, than their music. They're the classic triumph of style over substance.    Still, it's a fun album. It's also a pretty good one on the whole with 3 great songs (Anarchy, Bodies, and God Save the Queen). It earned a place in rock history (even if its place in history owes more to events surrounding the album than the album itself). Granted the Ramones were doing this a whole lot better on the other side of the pond, and the Clash had musicians that could actually write songs and play instruments back in the UK.

Art of Drowing...But you need to understand that bands change were not in the 90's anymore. I Love older AFI but i dont want to here the same album remade more then once. The music has to change thats what makes this band so great! Growth and development is what music is all about.         Anyways about DECEMBERUNDERGROUND it is a really good well writin album that has a cold feel to it. The guitar riffs and solos are writin better then ever, Daveys vocals have gottin better i just cant see why fans are complaining AFI always changes. I think if your looking to get into AFI start off with Black sails and shut your mouth then go from there...But i do thinkyou should get this Album because AFI is very different from any other band out there and every Album is a different story...

At 30 pages till the end I had to close it, I felt I wasted 3 days of my life reading this nonsense.  What kind of book is this? Fantasy? Love story? It is ridiculous, I strongly recommend DON'T BUY IT!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|John Barrowman who plays Captain Jack is magnetic.  Talk about charisma.  No wonder the others follow him even though they know very little about him.  For me Torchwood first and second seasons have been about knowing more about Captain Jack.  Dr. Who has never interested me that much.  Sometimes I watch some of the new Dr. Who on PBS.  I can take Dr. Who or leave it though the new Dr. Who is fascinating to me as a character.  I am mesmerized by Captain Jack though.  He is the man all men want to be with -- straight or gay.  His sexuality (actually it seems that for him, a non-human, human categories of sexual preference are silly and irrelevant) never seems to be an issue.  He can seduce anyone.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien Quadrilogy is absolutely the best science fiction quadrilogy of all time. The combined set covers every aspect of a superb sci fi that one would expect--science fiction based on existing and projected sci fi realities about space travel, space ship design, space travel, future technology, the intrigue and mystery of unknown planets and other life forms, some horror, excellent drama, and a well edited film, with superior directing and superior acting. The set includes not four, but nine DVD's, four of which cover two versions of the movies--original and director's cut; and the other five covering the making of the movies, including interviews with the actors--sometimes a few humorous and enlightening moments during the filming. This quadrilogy is a classic, and can serve as a science fiction course on the college level.
B001INZ79W|5.0|I always wondered why Coldplay was so popular with the 30 somethings, then I saw Coldplay on Saturday Night Live and was blown away.  What a great performance of three of their songs from this CD!  I listen to this CD nearly constantly -- it never fails to lift my spirits while also mellowing me out.     \\"Lost\\" is great except \\"Lost+ with JZ\\" -- a beautiful song almost ruined by some ignorant rapper talking about \\"axing\\" -- give me a break!    Life in Technocolor ii really adds to an already nearly perfect instrumental with great lyrics.  I am definitely now a solid Coldplay fan!
B001DCQIAU|3.0|This is great value for the Karajan fan, my caveat being that, like most (all?) Karajan, this is often more Karajan than composer. The recordings cover a wide period of Karajan's symphonic conducting, and often reveals Karajan's \\"vision\\" of the most important parts of the orchestral sound. And for me this is the problem.    Almost throughout, the orchestra is 'acoustically edited' via microphone placement and (re)mixing to emphasize what Karajan views as the important parts of the sound, while diminishing all the other \\"stuff\\". A simple case in point (as there are 38 CDs!), is the last movement of the Chaikovsky Third Symphony where the strings are almost not present -- at all. The first time listener would miss 40% (or so) of this movement; it's simply all brass (and quite close mic'ed as well).    Bruckner Seven and Nine as two more examples reflect the same \\"my vision\\" attitude. Forty years (or so) later, I have become accustomed to basic excellent performance; the playing on many of the \\"lesser\\" works (eg lower number Bruckner, and Chaikovsky) is often 'radio orchestra' quality.    The Beethoven cycle, excellent in many ways is for me caught up in the personality of Karajan. I think of how Furtwangler brings out the epic and drama without always saying \\"look at me\\". The Haydn symphonies are a Karajan showcase -- look what I can make from these pieces.      Will I go back to listen to (m)any of these CDs again? It's unlikely. i know just about all of these pieces reasonably well and found some surface features interesting, and some large-scale structures reflect Karajan's strength in long-term shaping, but there are many other more precise (classical view) recordings, and many other more personally forceful (romantic view) recordings, and these are the ones I will return to, to listen to the music.
067101756X|3.0|Not a very well written book. The only facts the author brings out are inventions already realized by mankind. Eg: Fiber-optics, IC chip. It would have been more believable if he wrote this book prior to these inventions. This book confirms why UFO photos are always in poor condition...They don't exsist.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I am baffled at how many people did not get this movie.  There are many drug induced sequences that take you through the characters journey and how they eventually \\"come together\\".  Anyone who has ever dabbled in psychedelics would understand where it is all coming from.  The scene with Bono is a depiction of where the journey moves from reality to perception.  Broaden your mind and open up to the world.  Life does not have to be taken so literally.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I rarely watch a movie or video more than once, but I've been watching this anniversary edition dozens of time since I bought it.  Great vocals and sincere performances, especially Michael Ball's \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\".
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I must say that, based on my experience with this order, I will never again use Amazon.com. When the order did not arrive within the specified amount of time, I tried to contact the seller, Kingdvdseller, according to Amazon's protocol for complaints. I got no response. I then notified Amazon and submitted their on-line form for my complaint ... still no response.    At this time, I am simply out over $200 and have nothing to show for it. Buyers, beware.
B00110K62U|5.0|I caught a glimpse of a small part of the concert on youtube so thought I would order the DVD set and watch it.  I don't regret it at all.  Roughly 8 yeras ago, I was in London watching the production, but didn't get the entire story.  Re-hearing the musical really helps!  The music is fine with me although it is not as high quality as the CD soundtracks, which I bought at the same time.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|This movie is so fun to watch. My oldest daughter was asking about this movie the other day.  I have it on vhs, but would prefer it on dvd.  Some of the lines can be corny at times, but that's okay.  The movie is terrific.  The color in the film is vibrant. Some of the characters costumes, and the props are beautiful.  I wouldn't say that this is a movie for little ones because of the violence or adult themes though.
1400082773|5.0|I received this as a gift in December 2008. February 2007, I had nothing else handy for a trip to Boston (from Albuquerque). At that time, Obama was a faint second-tier Presidential candidate, barely even acknowledged in the early (very early, as in almost two years before the main event) 2008 campaign news.<br /><br />This book reads very easily, with poetic phrasings throughout, a fascinating life story and a brilliant musings. As a political junkie who was wowed (like the rest of the free world) by Obama's 2004 Dem Convention keynote speech, and as a life-long anti-authoritarian in my own right, Obama's presentation of himself was easy to like.<br /><br />Fast-forward to 2009. Obama faces some of the greatest challenges of the last 70 years, with the world depending on him to usher much-needed changes into our world. It will be interesting to see how the details of his inner self, as presented in the book, come into play on this world stage on which he has chosen to perform (and I mean \\"perform\\" only in the purest, most respectful sense).<br /><br />I will not deny that I have fallen victim to Obama's charisma. Even before he was famous at all, I think I would have enjoyed being personally acquainted with him (actually, I would not so much, now that he bears the burden of our 2009 world with its constant challenges). Still, one would have to be incredibly mean-spirited not to admire this book's protagonist in his journey through pre-Presidential life, along with his excellent writing skill.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie touched my soul! It is one of the most heartwarming movies that you could ever see! It is the real deal, about real, regular people.<br /><br /> Alvin was a very wise man, I admire people like Alvin Straight! My favorite scenes was watching Alvin's friend with his ROLLED UP BREECHES LEGS, walking to Alvin's house to check on Alvin!, And the way Alvin's friend drove Alvin and Rose to the doctor's office, THAT WAS A TRUE CLASSIC MOMENT! And I loved the way Alvin touched people's hearts, that he met on his long journey.<br /><br /> This movie brought tears to my eyes several times, it is so heartfelt, and so touching! This movie is about a old man, who can no longer drive, so instead, he likes to drive his lawnmower. When Alvin finds out that his brother has had a stroke, Alvin feels compelled to visit him, and Alvin decides to drive his lawnmower on the long journey to see his brother.<br /><br /> If you are a soldier, or a veteran soldier who came home from the war, a certain part of this movie will touch your soul! My tears just started falling, as usual!<br /><br />  I loved the kindness that was shown to Alvin from other people who where perfect strangers, and I loved the kindness that Alvin returned to them! And I loved learning about Alvin, and finding out what kind of man he was, and he was not one for talking about himself, either.<br /><br /> The scene at the end of the movie touched my heart, the acting was awesome! Infact, every actor in this movie was outstanding, absolutely everyone in this movie did a outstanding job of acting! Awesome, and wonderful! I highly recommend this movie, and I will watch this movie again!
B000A2IPP0|4.0|I first saw this movie about two years ago in 2007.     I just watched it again and like it just as much, if not more.    What a very wonderful and very nice movie!    Steven Spielberg, a master at this, delivers a heartfelt and joyfully suspenseful film about a boy and an extra terrestrial.  The movie works beautifully for all age levels.      Everything comes together.  The VFX, the music, photography, actors and a sincere and lovely script by Melissa Mathison.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|My sister recommended the first movie, Tremors, to me years ago and loaned me her VHS copy although I privately thought the plot sounded corny, and was only humoring her. I thought it was a hoot, bought my own copy, and watched the rest of the series on TV. I was tickled to see all four movies in a DVD pack and we've been enjoying them all over again, this time with the \\"special features.\\"   I'm a big fan of this series.
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|As far as \\"superhero\\" movies go its probably the best I have seen so far. The joker made this movie great. Although I do not think the movie itself deserved an oscar I do think Heath Ledger did. He redefined the concept of \\"arch-criminal\\".
B000EE8W84|5.0|I ran across this book by accident following Wikipedia links, since I've never seen the TV series. It's a lush delight, with a slice-of-frozen-time writing style reminiscent of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, except this book gives a 1923-1944 look into the life of a Catholic English aristocratic family to whom the protagonist attaches himself. Evelyn Waugh wrote the book during six months spent living on soybeans after a parachute accident, so said he had a \\"kind of gluttony..for the splendours of the recent past.\\"   Since Waugh was a convert to Catholicism, he attempts to subtly proselytize his readers, which is slightly annoying since the characters end up renouncing their illicit romances to pursue lives of celibacy. Still, excellent look into a luxurious lifestyle only now afforded by the most ultra-rich.
0545128285|1.0|Stories lacked imagination and story development. The characters lacked personality and were poorly developed.

B000026FOA|4.0|Nick Drake-Five Leaves Left ****<br /><br />Of all three of Nick Drake's albums only one of those ever struck me as fantastic, made me absolutely fall in love with it, and only one of those three ever felt like it truly lived up to the hype. That album is Pink Moon. That damn thing haunts me and I think about it at random times and feel an urge to listen to it immediately. A Love Supreme is the only other album that does that to me.<br /><br />Five Leaves Left however would come next. For me it doesn't live up to the hype and I don't particularly love it. There isn't a single bad or weak track here, they are all great in fact. Drakes lyrics are easily the most personal and best written here as against the other two albums. His guitar playing is a virtuosic as always, but something about this album just doesn't feel right. Maybe because Pink Moon was my introduction into Drake's music it will always be the standard for me to which I compare the rest of his work. It may sound quite jaded but it isn't anything I can help.<br /><br />Only three songs on Five Leaves Left really hit me as classics and as brilliant. 'River Man' being the first. The somber tone in Drakes voice accompanied by the slightly out of place string arrangement is the sort of thing John Lennon and Paul McCartney tried to do with 'A Day In The Life' but didn't quite pull of. The second being 'Three Hours.' This to me might be the greatest song Drake ever wrote next to 'Pink Moon.' In at a staggering six minutes in length, which is like the equivalent of 'Mountain Jam' for the Allman Bros. it is truly a mini-epic. Lyrically it is unparalleled by anything else. The mood is dark as usually but I can't help but feel hope in the songs melody. The chugging bass line accompanied by almost renaissance guitar give an uplifting feel. The song is pure genius. The third being the lyrical genius of 'Fruit Tree' in which on his debut album Drake confesses that he knows his music won't reach the acclaim and recognition it should until his life has ended. Poetic bliss.<br /><br />As for the rest of Five Leaves Left nothing stands out, nothing strikes me as blaam! Though nothing else is bad. It just simply plays, and plays well. For a debut album, Five Leaves Left is incredible, but it still showed that Drake had more ground left to cover.s life has ended. Poetic bliss.    As for the rest of Five Leaves Left nothing stands out, nothing strikes me as blaam! Though nothing else is bad. It just simply plays, and plays well. For a debut album, Five Leaves Left is incredible, but it still showed that Drake had more ground left to cover.

B000025H0Q|3.0|Nick Drake-Bryter Layter ***<br /><br />It goes without saying that Bryter Layter is one of the most difficult albums in my collection. Coming along in a time of music when damn near every album was difficult this manages to be even more so. Adding to the fact is that no other album by Drake is this busy. But more so than that, I don't know if I actually like this record. I have listened to it over and over again but I don't think I even like it in the slightest bit. Much in the same way that I think Sleep Dirt by Frank Zappa is a fantastic record but cannot stand to listen to the damn thing. Bryter Layter suffers equally. I think this is a nice, or at best decent record despite the fact that I often find it impossible to listen to it.<br /><br />For me many of the songs here are forgettable and stand out very little in my mind if at all. 'Hazy Jane II' stands out the most in my mind but mostly because I hate the song. I truthfully find the whole whoa-is-me folky-jazz number incredibly pretentious and trite. Though I can respect and fully understand why so many consider it a full blown classic and the star of Bethlehem on this record. 'Introduction' stands out to me because it is the part of the album I love the most. Drake's fantastic finger picking of acoustic guitar has been one of the things I love about him most. His knowledge of alternate tunings and wide range and reach make for one underrated player. 'At The Chime Of A City Clock' is the only other standout for me. The subtle drumming mixed with the bright strings remind me of Central Park in the winter. The song is beautiful.<br /><br />As for the rest of the album I couldn't even begin to describe another song with out hearing it because they all seem so blaa to me. What doesn't help this album for me is that the fantastic guitar playing of Thompson is really out of place on a Drake record, and Drake's own guitar playing is ofter lost in the production which also on this album is some of the worst I have ever heard.<br /><br />But what really bothers me about this record is that it is without a doubt Drake's most depressing album lyrically, and musically it is as bright is a sunny may afternoon. I always thought if I heard an album like this it would be genius, much like Lou Reed's Berlin, but I must say Bryter Layter totally put all this to rest. It is just down right annoying and for those people out there who don't listen to the lyrics, (they know all the worlds but not what they mean which blows me away) this would seem like a happy album, which it totally is not.<br /><br />So no I can't truly give this a better rating than a three because it simply isn't that good. With all hype and tragedy aside, Drake was a genius but genius doesn't always work out for the better as attested to here.really bothers me about this record is that it is without a doubt Drake's most depressing album lyrically, and musically it is as bright is a sunny may afternoon.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|[[ASIN:B0013FSL3E Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)]]<br /><br />Being a big kid at heart, I decided to buy 'Wall E' based on the success of the previous productions from Pixar.<br /><br />I had been warned of the slow, 'silent' first scene, which turned out to be a unique experience. A nice way to introduce this endearing robot of the future. Just had to love Wall E's little mate, the cockroach! it wasn't hard to have immediate empathy with Wall E, as I found him to be a cute mechanical 'ugly duckling' who exuded love and craved companionship.<br /><br />Naturally the underlying theme of waste dumping, conservation and human lack of exercise and commitment, add to the simple 'Romeo & Juliet' love story between two robots who have humanoid feelings. I enjoyed the tale and had a few good laughs, in spite of the darker undertones of the tale referring to the possible 'end of civilization' because of lazy humanity.<br /><br />A nice flight of fantasy, and sci-fi, mixed together with a nice romance. A good evening's entertainment.<br /><br />A delightful film, and great value, with the fun add-ons included in the DVD. if you have a universal DVD player, then you can play this on your DVD in Australia (as we did)or in the UK etc.<br /><br />Love you Wall E!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys scifi. Also, you don't have to but watching the TV series is a good idea.

1400031567|4.0|This was the third Wallander novel translated into English but the fifth that he wrote.  For those reading his stories in order, it's important to read 'Dogs of Riga' and 'The Man Who Smiled' which have since been translated.  It's especially important in making sense out of what is written in this novel about what is going on in Wallander's personal life.     This is a well crafted novel, in the way that you would go about putting together a model.  Each piece has to be put into place and held there or the who edifice will fall apart.  Slowly in the commission of four murders (where all of the victims are killed by the blow of an axe to the head) we are made privy to what is driving the murderer.  By the third murder we know who he is, and should be able to fathom what is driving him, but not until the last murder do we understand his reasons.    Unlike some of the earlier books, this one is filled with comments about the weaknesses and the deterioration (according to Mankell) of traditional Swedish society and mores.  He laments the breakdown of the nuclear family while making the point that post-WWII society has done much to raise the standard of living for the average Swede.  He does a lot to remove the 'curtain' and expose 'the man behind the curtain' as the true power in Sweden who is corrupted by the freedom of a 'mind your own business' society.    Wonderfully written and translated.    Zeb Kantrowitz

B001EYGOEM|3.0|I guess my title says it all. she is a real good singer behind close doors but live she does need some work. yes she has only been singing for 6 years.since she was 12. this cd i think should have been put with her first one. maybe she just need to get threw all the old songs she wrote when she was young. i seen her interview and she does say some of the songs she has writen a long time ago and some people just forget she only been out for a couple of years. dont put her in the same sentence as britney spears. she was on disney since she was 11. as for sugarland and jennifer nettles. she has been singer alot longer and had grown up the hard way with music. dont get me wrong i love sugarland and im google for nettles but its not fair to put 3 singers that had grown up 3 differnt ways into one group as i been reading on here. give the girl a break and sit back and watch her grow. just remember she is young (18) and up and coming. she does need work but atleast she does write her own music. not like most of these other new singers have other people write them. atleast you can try and feel her passion in her words. give her a chance and watch her grow or just sink to the bottom which i dont think will happin. atleast she is not a one song wonder right. just give her a chance is what im saying.
B0018CNNTY|2.0|Some people are able to see symbolism and metaphor more easily than others.  If you view this movie without the symbolism then the actions by the lead character towards the child are undoubtedly cruel.  While watching I had to remind myself to look beyond the obvious and see the symbolism because the storyline at its face was pretty bizarre.  This distracted me from what the movie was trying to say.    It is clear that one needs to pay attention to the symbolism and metaphor when watching this movie.  With that in mind, think about the heroes in the story told by the main character:  1) A black slave  2) An Indian who appears as if from India but is referred to in terms of an American Indian (his \\"squaw\\")  3) A mystic who comes from the Earth  4) An explosives expert who when surrounded by the enemy detonates himself with a jacket filled with explosives  5) Charles Darwin  6) A charming handsome bandit who turns out to be French    Why would these characters be chosen?    I agree that the visuals were outstanding but the story just didn't do it for me.  You could say that I just didn't get it and you'd be right.  I would choose another movie.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|I think the reason why a lot of listeners of Dido are disappointed in this album is because it's not full of the \\"radio friendly\\" pop songs they're use to.  However, in my opinion, that doesn't make this album less brilliant than her previous two.  It's a solid release and I think it just takes a couple of thorough listening sessions to let it sink in.<br /><br />For one, the lyrics on this album are by far her most expressive ever.  If you take the time to actually listen to them, they tell a story that you can picture in your head.  That's brilliant song writing. Sure, a lot of it is sad, and it might not be your cup of tea, but she wrote it from the heart without the intention of making perfect \\"pop\\" songs.<br /><br />Also, the musicianship and production is the best I've heard from Dido.  I'm surprised at the 1 star reviews due to this aspect alone.  Some of the drumming is amazing, and the use of different types of instruments is a nice change from other typical pop albums.  The arrangements are also very unusual, but fresh.  However, that may be another reason the songs don't sound so \\"radio friendly\\" as some prefer.  It is not too busy sounding and cluttered as you sometimes hear in over-produced albums.  You can clearly here ALL parts being played as well as the intricate sounds in the background that Dido sometimes likes to throw in.<br /><br />My only (slight) disappointed might be Dido's use of her own voice.  Her voice is definitely in top form and pleasant as usual.  However, she doesn't sing with the authority she's capable of.  Anyone who has seen her perform live knows she's capable of singing more strongly to give more impact to the songs.  However, since most of the songs on this album are mellow, her soft airy voice works well to convey the emotion.<br /><br />Anyway, please give this album a couple of tries before dismissing it. If you can't get past Dido's typical style and be open to her new sound, then in my opinion, you don't really accept the strength or growth of her as a songwriter. It certainly doesn't mean you have to *like* it, of course.  Perhaps, you prefer the more catchy melodies of the past.  To be honest, I miss them too.  But, I'll say it again, this album is no less brilliant than her previous efforts, it's just different than what we are used to hearing from her.  At the very least, it deserves credit where it is due which is in Dido's songwriting and the excellent production.  These 1 star reviews are ridiculous and have no merit.of her as a songwriter.

B000A3XYZA|5.0|This one is a total success. The update to the 1930's and a slightly fascist regime works so well it's a wonder it wasn't done this way in Handel's time. The women are regally and gorgeously costumed. Beautifully and imaginitively directed. Everyone acts almost as well as they sing, but the singing requires much more of them and they all acquit themselves admirably. It's one difficult aria after another for all concerned and Handel characterizes each character within the music so very well. Delightedly recommended.
B000I0XBNK|2.0|I am not a movie lover but sometimes I enjoy watching something that is pure escapism.  From the reviews I read, I was under the impression that this movie would provide such an experience.  I was very disappointed.  I don't understand psychological, philosophical, literary references.  I am just to dumb. And, I am much to dumb to understand this movie.  If you like a good story, its not for you.  If you like movie's where things happen, its not for you.  I was confused from the beginning to the end.  There was not a single moment of coherency in the entire effort.  But then again, I'm sure its because I'm just too dumb.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|[[ASIN:B000W7JWUA The Settlers of Catan]]    This is a great game, but a word of caution. It is addictive. The fun is that it sets up differently for each game, so players have to adjust their strategy accordingly.    Players start with 2 settlements and 2 road sections. Rolling the dice gives resource cards, Brick, Wood, Rock, Wheat, and Sheep. By using and trading resources players build roads, settlements, and cities with point values. Intellegent play is rewarded, but the random throw of the dice sometimes stifles the best strategy.    I would recommend as a family or party game anytime.
0783225725|5.0|High Plains Drifter is not your typical western. It is a multi-level Clint Eastwood masterpiece that combines gritty western with dark humor and psychological mindplay. Drifter is almost Alfred Hitchcock-like in its delivery of serious imagery and characterizations. Excellent performances by the entire cast with Eastwood leading the way through the miserable lives of the pathetic citizens of Lagos. The people get a good mental spanking by the man with no name, and, in the end, he leaves you with a thing or two to think about.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|We just saw this movie last night at the Detroit Film Theater and it was amazing.        I would agree with another reviewer that it was better than The Dark Night.  Personally I think this should have been best picture of the year.        There are some twists on the vampire lore but they are to the betterment of the genre.        This is a dark movie about a sad lonely boy who is coming of age, dealing with bullies and suddenly meets a young girl who he befriends.        The gore is kept so short sudden bursts and each has meaning in driving home the story.  I never felt that it was simply a slasher flick because each act leads to consequences.        I have heard that the book differs at several interesting points with this movie but there are hints at the two major points I can think of.        I kind of wish they had spent a minute or two fleshing out his mother, given the movies ending, as well as gave a bit more info on his father. The father story left me wondering wether alcoholism led to his situation but then again there could even be a creepier element there.        There is a sadness in this movie and there are quesitons as to how Oskar will end up and whether or not there was a purpose in the not a girl characters actions.         Granted, the age of the characters/actors and the supposed age of one of the character lead to some to suggest this borders on inapppropriate or but my wife and I felt that every shot was key to the film.        Here is hoping that the skillful hand of this director soon helms many more films.        I dread the US version of this in 2010 because they will either over play the two elements left out from the book or underplay several vital elements in the movie that made the character development so moving.
B001ED7C58|3.0|When I first read the review's... I didn't expect much.  I was really happy when I heard the first track.  I loved the funky beat and thought it did reflect the characters in the books.  Not necessarly Edward's and Bella romance but the general chaos that happens along the way.  L.Park is always rocks but I was hoping for a little more in Bella's lullaby.  I would expect much more piano.  Other then that, it's nice background music for the most part.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|The movie had great action scenes, but it was way too long - they could have cut out about 45 minutes.  The movie was too dark, too evil, too twisted (Joker). I just didn't go away feeling Wow! That was a great movie! KL was almost unrecognizable, even creepy in light of his real life demise.  No thanks.  mdv
1416594884|1.0|Paraphrasing A. Alvarez's autobio title, Le Carre fans must continue in the wilderness wondering how a \\"favorite\\" author once more disappoints.  Mr. Cromwell continues to finger contemporary international areas of conflict ahead of most genre writers.  But his development seems to be \\"type writing volume\\" to fill space before a final resolve.<br /><br />His inkblot analysis of each character has become more than one wants to know.  None of characters is sympathetic.  Their interactions are unbelievable.  Their love fantasies are laughable.  Their dialog is tedious.<br /><br />Le Carre is indeed one of the great writers of the last 50 years.  Future works I am sure will continue to be published and sell.  But I have given up, finally, of expecting his early genius to be met again.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|Growing up in the 80s, Mickey Rourke was James Dean to me. His part was too small for me to notice him in BODY HEAT. The critics had caught a glimpse of him and his potential in that film. I knew that I was on to something watching him as the fast talking womanizing Baltimore con-artist Boogie, in Levinson's DINER. His honesty as an actor pierced my emotions, even though he was playing a character that was lying throughout the entire film. When I witnessed his serene and suicidally introspective portrayal of The Motorcycle Boy in Coppola's urban dreamscape of S.E. Hinton's teenage angst novel RUMBLE FISH, I knew that I had just witnessed The Rebirth of James Dean. When I saw his cool slowburning streetwise Italian dreamer, Charlie in THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLIAGE, I knew I had found a film actor I could idolize. I wore my hair like him. I tried to dress like him. I wanted to be him. Man, this was the COOLEST actor taking the coolest parts in Hollywood! Mickey was IT!<br /><br />But, like Dean, it seemed that Mickey would metaphorically and almost literally crash and leave us with only three truly GREAT films. After a few briefly compelling performances in the 80s as the hardboiled Kowalski in Cimino's YEAR OF THE DRAGON, the lascivious John in 9 1/2 WEEKS, Harry Angel in ANGEL HEART, and the hilarious Henry Chinaski in BARFLY, Mickey's career dwindled into lesser leads, bit parts, and cameo roles. Mickey became \\"difficult\\" to work with. Mickey wanted to give up the studio politics and the collaborative involvement with a craft that he was, quite literally, born to do. And become what? A boxer? The owner of a hair salon? A biker? A thug? Then, Mickey lost himself for 14 years. In a reply to a ten year hiatus question backstage at The Golden Globes, Rourke said, \\"Let's get it right. Ten years sounds easy.\\" Ultimately, he was alone. Mickey Rourke was forced to do some soul searching.<br /><br />Into the 21st Century, no one noticed Mickey's hilarious turn as The Cook in SPUN. A wild and sardonically dark comedy about methamphetamine users. (The Cook watches and adores wrestling on TV while cooking up his dope. One wonders if this gave Aronofsky the idea to cast Rourke in THE WRESTLER?) His sad and tender moment at the end of that film was a revelation of things to come. The final monologue is a wonderful precursor to his character in THE WRESTLER. It broke my heart. Then, a new generation of fans and critics were talking about him again, after grabbing everyone's attention as disfigured Marv in Robert Rodriguez' comic book pastiche, SIN CITY. Sort of a throwback to Rourke's JOHNNY HANDSOME. The best thing about SIN CITY was Rourke's performance. It stood out like a sore thumb. Even over the special look of that film.<br /><br />Now, things have changed for Mr. Rourke. With the critical acclaim (for once they got it right) for this film, he is all over the talk show circuit recalling his loneliness, his mistakes, and episodes from his former life. Like a 12 stepper, Mickey now seems humble and apologetic. Thanking everyone for giving him the chance to once again become the serious actor he once was. (We should all thank them too.) He is no longer taking anything for granted. Everyone loves a humble winner. And God Bless him, Mickey Rourke is BACK! And his performance in THE WRESTLER is a WINNER!<br /><br />The generous Mr. Darren Aronofsky has given Mickey Rourke the role of a lifetime with this film. Knowing Rourke's reputation for being next to impossible to work with, Aronofsky could not get the financing for this film when he first attached Mickey's name to the project, but promised Mickey an Oscar nomination if he would only listen to his direction and do everything he was told to do. Mickey kept his promise, and it appears that the masterly and prescient Aronofsky has kept his. THE WRESTLER was not written for Mickey Rourke, but was later tailored to fit him personally. The themes are semi-autobiographical.<br /><br />The story is not complicated. Although, changed and improvised due to Rourke's involvement, the script, written by Robert Siegel, is reminiscent of a 20's or 30's bloody pulp fiction boxing story that could have been penned by the creator of Conan The Barbarian, the late Robert E. Howard. It is a simple pulp character study about a lonely beaten man who has been to the top of the mountain only to be brought back down again by the repercussions of his actions, and a savage career choice that has taken a brutal toll on his body from staged battles, steroid juice abuse, and a lot of 80's Hair Metal. (The biggest laugh in the film, comes from Rourke's line about Kurt Cobain and what he did to 80's Metal.) Filmed in a grainy Indy style with long loose tracking shots and circular handheld camera movements, it is a sad, gritty, brutal, and COMIC semi-documentary narrative told mostly from Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson's POV. Not every movie goer will appreciate the raw look of this film, the patchwork sequences, or the triumphantly open ending. True film lovers will.<br /><br />The performances here are very brave indeed. Marisa Tomei is essential as Cassidy. She bares it all as a sweet, conflicted, past her prime stripper mom, unwilling to succumb to The Ram and his half desperate attention for her affections. Most 40 something actresses wished they looked this good, but might never agree to pole dance almost completely nude in a film about an aging wrestler. You will fall in love with her all over again in this film. Her Nomination for a Golden Boy is well deserved.<br /><br />Unlike De Niro who donned 40 lbs of fat for his role as Jake LaMotta, Rourke bulked up approximately 40 lbs of muscle on top of his already commanding girth. Rourke is scarred, pimpled, pumped, and battered. His body and visage are roadmaps of world weariness and pain. One grim shot shows Rourke shooting steroids into his veiny, mottled, and scarred rearend. A selfless dedication and adherence to character. A fearless commitment by a great actor to shamelessly open himself up to his audience. Baring his wounded nakedness, as well as the internal wounds to his lonely psyche. And isn't this what we love about our greatest actors? This film IS Mickey Rourke. Body and Soul. This is an extremely giving performance. It is symbolic, commanding, sad, demanding, honest, demure, comic, tender, uplifting, and most of all, heartbreaking.<br /><br />A broken man searches for acceptance, dignity, and redemption, but finds himself instead.<br /><br />The same can be said about The Second Coming of Mickey Rourke. THIS IS A GREAT FILM! Just give this man his Oscar. I can only hope Mick gets his Harley back!<br /><br />This is The Best Film of 2008.hanged and improvised due to Rourke's involvement, the script, written by Robert Siegel, is reminiscent of a 20's or 30's bloody pulp fiction boxing story that could have been penned by the creator of Conan The Barbarian, the late Robert E.

B000H6SXMY|3.0|I was very excited b/c I love Friends but many of the discs are damaged or missing information. They skip around, there are some you are not able to turn of the subtitles, and some just freeze up. The quality control seems to have been missing for this box set.
0440241413|3.0|this is my first \\"sophie\\" book. i found it hard to get into the  book until the halfway through it. Rebecca can be very irritating. her dishonesty was frustrating as well as her immaturity but her desire to shop is what bonded us! overall it was entertaining and i guess thats what its supposed to be about.
B001GQACGO|4.0|Irs always refreshing to me when a black artist looks outside of the box to create an album.  If you notice the most successful artists have though outside of the box: Prince, Outkast, Black Eyed Peas, Missy Elliott, etc.  I honestly believe in a few years Solange Knowles will be added to that list, simply because her style is very out of the box.  I love Beyonce as a PERFORMER.  I think she is the ABSOLUTE BEST of our generation.  I have been and will continue to attend her concerts.  However, some of her past music I felt was over the top. The I am disc was the perfect medium to offer relaxing music to those of us who don't want to hear yelling all the time.  I was actually shocked and amazed at the material; this is not indicative of Beyonce's work at all.  She dabble and experimented with quite a bit.  I don't know though she will stick with that level of production.  She may go back to the hollering and yelling.  The Sasha Fierce disc was just okay.  I gave it 3 stars because it was all over the place.  I couldn't pin it down to one genre.  I applaud thinking outside of the box, but I just couldn't find the cohesiveness.  With that said, my fav tracks would be RADIO, and Scared of Being Lonely
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Not many of us give thought to what it must be like to be in combat, particularly in someplace like Iraq.  This series tells the story (based on the non-fiction book by Evan Wright) about a group that was on of the first on the scene in Iraq at the beginning.  Certainly a complex topic, but with many facets to it.  Not only does it show the war side of it, it shows the human side that those serving are faced with.  It's complex and rather gritty at times.  The series doesn't glorify war and there's no political slant to it.  It focuses on the marines and what goes with it.    I actually started reading the book that this series was based on by Evan Wright before I started the series. The characters that were described so well in the book are brought to life on screen with a fabulous cast that is led by Alexander Skarsgard as Brad Colbert, Team Leader.  This series cetainly shows his range as an actor.  He's the \\"iceman\\" - calm, tough and calculating, but also shows humor, compassion and downright sadness at times.  We get many glimpses of him behind a large gun and what he conveys with his eyes nothing short of amazing.   Also James Rascone as Ray Person, Brad's Humvee driver and a great source of comic relief.  Sleep deprived and on \\"RipFuel\\", he's usually telling stories, making jokes or singing songs, but you see him a bit down a few times and he does that equally as well.  Stark Sands is excellent as Lt. Nathaniel Fick. His performance is a little more difficult to describe, but I can't imagine someone else cast in the same part.  His interactions with the entire cast are fantastic.    The rest of the casting is great as well, but the 3 mentioned above were the most noteworthy.  I don't own any \\"series\\" DVD box sets, and this is my first.  Well worth the time.  If you like the series, check out the book that is was based upon.    While the series follows the dialog almost verbatim most of the time, there are things in the book that are not in the series, as wellas insights and more information about the marines in the series.  The book gives the information, while the series gives a visual and puts a face on the marines described.
0141439475|4.0|Maybe the most surprising thing about reading Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is in discovering just how different--and how much more complex--the original is than the story as it has passed into popular culture. Here is one of the great myths of modern man and the Age of Science and Reason; it's a myth that in some respects is even more relevant today with the prospect of widespread genetic engineering. The dream of unlocking the secret of life--and the parallel fear that it might turn into a nightmare remains with us long after Shelley gave it form in this short novel.<br /><br />On the downside, Shelley's prose bears all the faults of the age in which it was composed. *Frankenstein* is almost unbearably overwritten, its characters melodramatically overwrought, and the whole production bathed in the over-the-top hysteria that often typifies Romantic literature. It's comical to hear long eloquent orations delivered by characters in the middle of scenes in which they're literally fighting for their lives--and, indeed, even more ridiculous to hear the monster himself speaking like a Shakespearean actor. To be sure, Shelley's monster is a great deal different than the green-skinned blockhead of the movies, no bolts in his neck, jagged forehead scar, or monosyllabic groans here. This is a pensive, autodidactic monster. Still, the way Shelley envisions him, he's actually far more horrific than Boris Karloff or Herman Munster. Here we have a stitched together assemblage of corpse-parts that the flesh doesn't always entirely cover, leaving the workings of tendons and the like grotesquely exposed to view. He's a wild, ragged, hideous-looking zombie, but not a shambling, sleepwalking, unfeeling drone; instead, he's super-strong, super-agile, super-fast--and he's as eloquent as Cicero.<br /><br />Certainly, Shelley felt it necessary to give the monster a brain and the silver-tongue to express its complex cogitations because *Frankenstein* is, in the end, more a philosophical novel than a tale of horror. What does it mean to be human? Do we overstep our bounds by encroaching on the miracles of life and try to play \\"god\\"? Is there a god? Do we not feel pity for the \\"monster,\\" which, by its appearance alone, seems to be the embodiment of all we loathe and fear...and yet, in fact, only wants for compassion and companionship to make it \\"human\\"? These are the kinds of questions that Shelley asks in *Frankenstein* and to do so she allows her monster to defend himself in the court of ideas like F. Lee Bailey.<br /><br />For that matter, it's somewhat hard to wrap one's mind around the fact that Shelley's Victor Frankenstein begins his work at reanimating corpses while still at college and--instead of the more appropriate middle-aged scientist familiar from innumerable remakes--Dr. Frankenstein in this novel is no older than his mid-20s throughout. Apparently, Shelley herself wasn't yet twenty when originally composing the tale, so that perhaps explains Frankenstein's age here, but it doesn't seem quite right to have him be so young.<br /><br />Still, if you can get past the various absurdities, the purple prose, the frequent repetition, and the more tedious travelogue descriptions of the countrysides of Switzerland, Scotland, the frozen north, etc. there are some genuinely frightening scenes and, more importantly, still-compelling ideas that make Shelley's *Frankenstein* not only the original, but the best elucidation of the myth of the mad man of science and the responsibility of the creator towards ((and for)) that which he creates. If for only the sheer importance and enduring influence of this work in literature and popular culture, Shelley's *Frankenstein* is worth reading, and giving four stars.ovel than a tale of horror.

0380715430|2.0|I love the writing of Bill Bryson and so it pains me to pan him but this book, while absolutely delightful, does play fast and loose with the facts.  It feels like dear Bill put more of his energies into being clever and amusing rather than knuckling down to some hard research. An example? Bryson states that \\"Estimates of the number of languages in the world usually fix on a figure of about 2,700...\\" Ethnologue currently lists 6912 living languages in the world.  I doubt that 4200+ languages were discovered between 1990 (when this was originally published) and today.<br /><br />I picked this up because I've really enjoyed Bryson's other works, especially his first-person travelogues.  I think I'd better stick with those.  I wish I hadn't invested in this.
1400049628|5.0|Yes, i'm a guy, i'm using my mom's amazon account for this review.    Now to buisness.  This guide spells out what you should do and not do in the inevitable rise of the undead.  My friend introduced this book to me and i have become a believer in the threat of a zombie apocolypse.  From weapon choice (i prefer the 20ga shotgun and multiple blades) to hideouts (you can convert your home to an anti-zombie house in a few hours) to zombie history).  When this does happen, grab some friends, appropriate survival gear, food and of course multiple weapons and choose your plan of action.  Wether it be to fortify where you are, or go an a gureilla rampage, or to escape to a remote area and set up camp, this guide will help you every step of the way.  This guide will save your life!!  Now for my personal choices for weapons: 20ga shotgun, 150 rounds; my katana; many, many knives; a 22cal rifle and handgun; a machette, and some pipe bombs that i could get form a kid i know's friend.  Happy zombie killing!
B000IFS0HM|5.0|I resisted reading Angela's Ashes for a long time , simply thinking the book was over hyped.I saw Frank McCourt  on PBS hosting a tour of Dublin pubs and his affability inspired me to pick this up.  Now that I've given in my sense is that McCourt's genius in this was to write in the voice of his childhood self. The almost unbearable scenes of poverty and endless suffering he describes become  through the eyes of a child something tangible and since it is a first hand account a testament of endurance and survival that ultimately lifts the spirit.<br /><br />There are enough reviews below that summarize the outline of the story so I'll just say that occasionally a book or film live up to it's hype. Angela's Ashes is one of those books.
0877180121|5.0|I use this book with my youngest beginners. I also like Chester's Easiest Piano Course but I that doesn't seem as popular in the US. I learned with this method myself and find the students really enjoy the book. It is possible, as noted in a few of the other reviews, for kids to just pick this up and use it and that goes a long way to explaining its endurance and popularity. The 'middle C method' with its simple introduction to notes and rhythm creates happy young musicians and that should be the main focus where children and music are concerned.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Wall-E is a remarkable film about a lovable robot left alone to tend the Earth, which was abandoned by the human race.  The story is compelling and the visuals stunning - truly a great piece of movie making.  Much has been made of the fact about the fact that much of the movie has no dialog.  That actually lends to the charm of the movie and if you approach that aspect with an open mind you will likely find your self just as sucked in as I was.
1400082773|5.0|[[ASIN:0967602858 Raw: An Erotic Street Tale]]<br /><br />I only 21-years-old, but I actually read this book a few years ago, my mother gave it to me as a gift after she heard Obama deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. My mother and I don't often have the same tastes...she likes Miles Davis, I like Lil Wayne . . . she still dances the Bop, I do the Harlem Shake . . . she reads Maya Angelou, I read Teri Woods.<br /><br />We both loved this book.<br /><br />When (now President!) Obama wrote this memoir, I'm sure he had no idea where his political career would utlimtely take him. This is not a book written by a wannabe presidential candidate, but of a man who went on a journey to discover himself, and come to grips with his heritage. He lays it all bare in this book. His determination, his focus, his honesty, and desire to be true to himself . . . laying out warts as well as dimples, makes this book that I think should be required reading for all Americans.<br />I'm so glad I read it long before Obama announced his candidacy, because in doing so I felt I was kinda ahead of the game. I felt I knew who the man was, and not just the candidate, and this was a man I wanted as my leader, because I knew he was compassionate, intelligent, and had leadership qualities. This was a man I could follow. This was a man I could trust.<br />Yeah, I understand the slogans my friends shouted when Obama was elected...My President is Black! But my slogan? My President is a man I can trust. My President is man who cares. My President is Barak Hussein Obama. A man who knows what it's like to be in need, and will take care of those in need.<br />God Bless America.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0967602858 Raw: An Erotic Street Tale]]
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|I'll admit that I went into Quantum of Solace more or less dreading a repeat of the Licence To Kill debacle. All the danger signs were there - a rushed script because of a writers' strike, threats of Bond going rogue again plus the problem that great Bond films are usually followed by naff ones. The short running time wasn't encouraging, nor the bigger budget and promise of more action.     Well, this isn't one of the great Bond films, and Casino Royale set the bar far too high for it to compete. But it's certainly not a disappointment if you go in aware of that, and more gratifyingly, the similarities to Licence To Kill are superficial. Where Casino Royale was like making love all night long, this is more of a gratifyingly frenzied *beep* of a film. The running time isn't a problem because, like From Russia With Love, this is a pared down machine with no fat to trim away, throwing out all the overused touchstones to get down to business. From a plot point of view there's maybe a little too much one corpse leading to the next plot point in the first third, but the film wisely ditches that approach early.     Dan Bradley's action scenes are thankfully not as ineptly over-edited and incoherent as in Paul Greengrass' films, but aren't as impressive as Gary Powell's work on Casino Royale. There are moments of familiarity - a motorbike sequence borrows from the unimpressively shot harbour scene in Jackie Chan's The Protector, but without the lethargic pacing, while an aeriel dogfight owes a lot to a famously rejected stunt originally intended for the opening of GoldenEye - and the opening car chase through heavy traffic could have benefited from not trying quite so hard. But within them there are moments of stylisation that few other Bonds have attempted and failed at but which are far more successful here, most notably an impressive opera sequence that could have done with a few more shots to clarify the odd mechanical detail (something other parts of the film could benefit from). It's also surprisingly vicious - for perhaps the first time in a Bond film, innocent bystanders are deliberately killed. That said, the rationale for the explosions at the end is more than a little dubious.     The film isn't as humorless as some have complained: there's a lot of dry humor where appropriate and a delightfully playful game of cat-and-mouse with Bond and M in a hotel, but none of the outright slapstick comedy that dragged the series down before. Nor is Forster's direction or the editing as awkward as some found it: there's a pleasingly epic scale to the film allied with a non-nonsense straight-down-to-business attitude that works well for this particular story.     The most curious complaint is that it's just action with no character development, when nothing could be further from the truth. While there is more action, the characterisation is integrated into both plot and action. Bond is once again on an emotional journey - forgiveness, believe it or not, is ultimately the quantum of solace of the title - though this time the heart and soul of the film is Giancarlo Giannini's Rene Mathis, the kind of man Bond might be capable of becoming and one he learns something about himself from. One of their scenes is easily one of the very finest moments in the entire history of the series.     Craig still owns the role impressively and Jeffrey Wright starts to come in to his own as Felix Leiter this time round. Mathieu Amalric is one of the better villains of the past twenty years. He won't be among the greats, but he convinces and the scheme is genuinely ingenious in its simplicity. Olga Kurylenko manages to shake off the ineptness of her former performances to be a more than adequate but not especially memorable female lead, though Gemma Arterton lets the side down badly in a part that has unwelcome elements of Serena Gordon in GoldenEye and Rowan Atkinson in Never Say Never Again. Thankfully it's a small role so her weak and stilted straight-out-of-stage-school acting can't do too much damage.     Intriguingly, the film exists in a more convincing world of global politics than we've seen before in a Bond film: SPECTRE would have loved to be around in an era when governments eagerly step into bed with crime syndicates if it suits their ends and where corporations are able to play governments and intelligence agencies against each other. Here Bond works for a British government that tortures suspects on foreign soil and blindly goes along with foreign interests and crime syndicates alike in its desperation to snatch the scraps from the superpowers' tables. Initially, Bond is just as ruthless and morally flawed as his masters, the bullish arrogance gradually being smoothed away by emotional experience as he learns the importance of forgiveness to find the quantum of solace of the title that he needs to go on.     Yes, there are weaknesses - M's office is overdesigned, a few scenes could have played better, the song is crap and the gunbarrel sequence is a big and unnecessary mistake - but it's not the crushing disappointment some are claiming. It may not be a great Bond movie, but it most definitely is a Bond movie, and a damn good night out at the pictures. And one that left me seriously thinking that even if the series never recaptures the high of Casino Royale,we may just be entering a genuine second golden age of Bond movies.     Although a decent but  unspectacular array of extras have been announced for the two-disc DVD, don't be too surprised if there's a double-dip 3-disc set in a year or so's time as with the recent Casino Royale collector's edition.

B000WC3AKI|3.0|The film that kicked off the 90s disaster movie revival, Twister is a spectacle, pure and very simple, with just enough plot to propel you to the next big set piece of destruction as ex-stormchaser Bill Paxton finds himself swept up in the thrill of the chase as he tries to get Helen Hunt to sign their divorce papers. Don't look for anything profound - Cary Elwes' villainous better-funded rivals even drive black vans while, after the film goes to enormous lengths to stress how all-powerful the twisters are by throwing oil tankers and even houses at them, the heroes survive by, er, tying themselves to some pipes and holding on very tight. Yet the special effects are suitably apocalyptic while the film has a real sense of speed and motion thanks to some great helicopter and driving work, and even the presence of two of the most irritatingly mannered supporting actors in the business, Philip Seymour Hoffman (in the Jack Black role) and Jeremy Davies, doesn't dampen the dumb fun. And no doubt about it, the cow is definitely the star of the show.     After  a previous underwhelming  release, the 2-disc  set  finally gives  the film a  decent  selection  of  extras even if the transfer  doesn't  appear to be an imprpvement on the previous  issue.
B001GKJ2FW|1.0|I'm 58 years old. I am speaking truthfully when I say that this movie absolutely ranks as the worst picture that I have ever seen.    The movie was both insulting and condescending. Insulting in its misogyny towards men, disrespect for the role of the father, wreaking of immorality and crudeness, lack of a plot or storyline, poor vocals, and (time permitting) probably everything else. Condescending in that I came away from the movie feelings as if the participants colluded and conspired to try an experiment to see if they could put out a stupid movie to see if people would actually buy it, and to fleece people when they did. $$$$$$$$$$$$. It's always about the money. Produced by Tom Hanks? Give me a break. One of Steven Spielberg's best buds. For real?    First, I bought this screen \\"gem.\\" Then I laughed watching it last night because it was so utterly ridiculous. Then, I sold it today, happily losing only $6 on it. $6 too much though. I assume that the person who bought it made an intelligent purchase, but I've lost enough money on lousy movies already like the Dark Knight (more stellar reviews) for instance. I would not allow myself to lose the entire amount I paid for it.    What is it about people today? Have they lost their minds? Have they gone totally ka blue e? It's popular delusions and the madness of crowds isn't it? And the fascination with Meryl Streep and her jumping up and down on a bed. All totally unreal. Too much kool-aid I fear. Next, someone will simply have to do a \\"movie\\" on all out human depravity.    This movie stinks. I would say that what it stands for stinks too, but it doesn't stand for anything. A psychological snapshot of what turns us on these days. Sad. Very sad indeed.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Overshadowed by  the success of Airplane! and The Naked  Gun films, Top  Secret! is in many ways  the funniest and certainly  the most  inventive of the Zucker-Abrahms comedies.  Unlike its more  famous stablemates  it doesn't have  a  single  clearly  defined  genre  to  spoof,  instead offering an inspired hybrid  of World War Two movies, spy thrillers and Elvis  and beach  party movies (with potshots at The Blue  Lagoon  and Raiders of the Lost  Ark en route) set  in communist East Germany that provides a slew of targets, most  of  which it hits dead center. The jokes veer from   crude and obvious to flights  of  amazing surrealism -  the railway  station scene has to be  seen to  be  disbelieved while it  even throws in  an underwater barroom brawl in  a  Western  saloon and  a bookshop sequence played  entirely in reverse - with plenty of remarkably clever visual gags  along the  way. There are perhaps fewer familiar faces this  time  round (Omar  Sharif as an ill-fated spy, Peter  Cushing as  a bookseller, Jeremy Kemp as another German officer) but a lot of laughs,  often in  the worst possible taste, amounting  to one of the most genuinely inspired movie spoofs  ever made, and one  well worth rediscovering.    The DVD  isn't  as impressive  as  Paramount's 'Don't  Call  Me  Shirley' edition of Airplane! but has a decent  selection of extras: audio commentary by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, Jon Davidson, Hunt Lowry and Fred Rubin, 4 alternate scenes, 3 storyboard sequences, and the theatrical trailer.

0783226063|1.0|The movie form of Dune is terrible. It has very few similarities to the wonderful book except for the same (very) basic plot line. The acting was terrible and unconvincing. The special effects were very poor, even for the 80s. If someone has not read the book, I can understand how confusing this movie could be. If someone has read the book, then this movie is just terrible.    Stilgar, an important and powerful character in the book, is just a small shadow of his book form in the movie. Duncan Idaho was not nearly as major a character in the movie as he was in the book. And I am pretty sure that the Harkonens did not have heart-plugs in the book. The final knife fight between Paul and Feyd was intense and exciting in the book, in the movie however, the knife fight was not intense and very short lived.    If you have read the book, do not pass up a free chance to watch this movie, however, do not bother buying it. It is interesting to see some of the characters and events in movie form, but once again, it is not worth paying for. If you have not read the wonderful book, read it. Do not waste your time with this awful movie.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|After 12 long years of waiting Yentl is FINALLY on DVD in the USA. Sigh. I am beside myself with happiness and joy!!! I first fell in love with Barbra after I saw the concert series on HBO in the late 90s. I was in high school and was inspired by her amazing voice, being a singer myself at the time. I just remember thinking I had never heard a voice so magical. The power of that voice is clearly captured in Yentl. After my mom informed me that she was also an actor I started renting as many of her films as I could find. Yentl was one of my favorites and I was so sad to learn I couldn't buy it on DVD when I started my Barbra collection. When I awoke this morning to my \\"Yentl 2 DVD Director's Cut\\" e-mail from Amazon.com my eyeballs nearly popped out of my head! I am SO happy and excited! This is SUCH a wonderful film and I feel blessed that we can all have access to it whenever we want to watch. Thank you Barbra!

B001GM28HO|3.0|Lady Gaga's gimmick -- aside from being a Female impersonator (hey, folks: s/he's \\"bluffin' with her muffin,\\" to quote her own damn lyric, a lyric to which she adds that she's, \\"stunnin' with her love-glue gunnin....\\" I'll probably be flamed here for pointing out that Gaga is male -- but hey, by all means, feel free to do the math for yourself) -- is harmonic contrast, taken to the absolute extreme: Gaga presents a female voice with backing vocals that are exclusively male, for example; uses alternations of vocoder with vocal, and even drops her male backing vocals (Poker Face) so deeply down into the mix -- to levels of bare audibility (and seemingly keyshifted and placed into mono) -- while keeping her own lines recorded almost into the red -- all of which is fine, by the way, perfectly fine. It's a hit-record by the numbers, but this is really, REALLY well done.<br /><br />\\"Just Dance\\" is such an obvious monster at radio that I imagine record company execs were literally drooling over the future numbers -- any song THIS well done can move a million units in re-mixes ALONE. \\"Poker Face\\" is double-bridged (using a bridge into chorus and another bridge out of it), \\"Just Dance\\" uses a rap in the place of a guitar solo (her own, in one mix, a male voice for the current radio edit) -- again, this is all about harmonic contrast. Some of the songwriting here is remarkably sophisticated, the crux of it is that the sophistication here is used to communicate the simplest of possible messages -- another contrast -- call it poetic contrast, if you like.<br /><br />\\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Poker Face\\" are obvious singles, although \\"Poker Face\\" is not your typical single selection due to the incredible degree of songwriting sophistication -- the fidelic qualities aside, here. I do wish Gaga would fade-out the obvious singles instead of hard-stopping everything; some at radio seemed to have re-mixed a fade-out into Gaga's titles themselves, and feels correct for mass market airplay -- and Gaga, if you're reading this, let me say that this feels utterly correct for club-play, as well; it's not exactly a secret that giving the DJ a nice long fade-out to work with makes things a lot easier for the guy spinning the wax at any club, and improves your own spin-count.<br /><br />I notice (welllll... at least I think I notice) that Gaga is sharp enough to keep the bass line slightly leading the drums during choruses, while the bass line seemingly trails the drums during verses -- the choruses thereby seem WONDERFULLY set-off and are some TRUE earworms. Gaga has a voice that seems to be in F, is naturally sharp, and with a natural trill as well as power -- Gaga CAN sing, keys are held and pitches are true, even live (well, from what I've seen at YouTube so far) -- and is set off, once again, by backing vocals that are male, generally in E or C, generally buried in the mix, used to set-off her own vocals via contrast -- Gaga is clearly the star of this show.<br /><br />The amount of thinking that went into the production here is obvious; this is an absolute monster of a record made by people who clearly know what they are doing. Gaga's look, presence, manner, and sound are the result of an awful lot of thought -- she has everything she needs to be the next generation's Cher, and I mean that in a good way.<br /><br />You know... one more thought: we have had so many years of pop music pretending to be anti-pop; think of the entire grunge movement, for example... that Gaga's timing into the marketplace couldn't have been more perfect: Gaga's quote that pop art, \\"will never be low-brow,\\" allows her to actually position herself as a musical anti-hero by firmly embracing the confines of pop AS AN ACT OF REBELLION. (!)<br /><br />Yeah, I'm telling you: if Nirvana and Peal Jam had never happened, Gaga would never have had the opportunity to explode like this.<br /><br />You KNOW I'm right.<br /><br />Looking out across the musical horizon of the moment, Gaga is probably the sharpest knife in the drawer.<br /><br />The potential career here for this person, whoever they are, is a FRANCHISE.r here for this person, whoever they are, is a FRANCHISE.

B001B6K2TG|5.0|In a world where popular music is more about image than substance, this breath of fresh air blows from a happy place far away from the musical world that lives on the radio.  A really enjoyable listen, this is a blues album that makes you feel like you're up on the stage clapping and shuffling right along with these guys.  If you're trying to expose your kids to something great that isn't recorded 30 years ago, this is it.  I would recommend this album to anyone, blues fan or not.  This will make you want to find a sunny spot on the porch with a tall glass of lemonade and smile like the good ole days are here and kicking.
B001Q4Z5UY|2.0|I liked the idea of the film because of the 'car wars' reference. The movie apparently is a remake of a book or movie called 'car wars 2000' though i was interested in the concept because of a game called 'car wars' by a dice game company.     The movie has a very simplistic character development and you don't feel the characters so you don't really get into the film. A lot of the film is quickly moved on. Again no development.     The Plot is written to move quick and like the characters pretty blah. so you can predict its every move.    As for the action, it is alright though if you want to actually see the action it is a bit like 'daredevil' in that the camera bounces around so fast you can't really see what is going on or get an idea. I personally don't like that as much.     The way it is shot, the taste of the grit look is nice and gives a nice appeal.    i give it a C- really. not a memorable one, nor really just fun, but just is. A let down for me.
B001GM0GNC|4.0|I completely agree with O. Javier \\"Javier\\"... except...    I haven't \\"listened\\" to the DVD yet, but the dual CDs sound awful.  They're fine if you need a little musical/audio entertainment while you're waxin' the Honda, but don't expect these discs to sound even decent on a good audio system.  Whatever the problem - Over-Compression or just awful Mixing, EQ and Mastering - this sounds terrible.  Virtually no dynamic range at all... no highs... muffled thudding lows... very sad.    Maybe this is purposeful, in that they'll get to \\"ReMaster\\" it soon, and get you to buy it again.    I do disagree with some of the other reports on the performance.  I think the group \\"sounds\\" really inspired.  Some nice new arrangements that still capture the feel and energy of the original recordings sufficiently so the crazies won't feel ripped-off if the guys are actually inspired enough to rearrange and redux these very old arrangements.    However... I haven't watched the Video yet, so maybe there's physical evidence to support the idea that the Police weren't as inspired as I think I hear...  maybe Sting or Stewart or Andy look asleep at the wheel... that might make a difference in someone's enjoyment.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is art in motion. From the warm, descending buzz that starts \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" to the regal organs and shimmering notes that end \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\", to listen to Radiohead's masterpiece is to experience total submersion in a world that is not entirely your own.    The album is consistently bewildering in the way it shrugs off expectations. Not only was it a drastic departure from OK Computer, Radiohead's other seminal work and Kid A's immediate predecessor, but each of its ten songs subvert the listener's expectation of what might follow. The gentle beauty of the titular track and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" are in stark contrast to the alt-rock grit of \\"Optimistic\\", the unnerving tension of \\"Idioteque\\" or the transcendental sway of \\"How to Disappear Completely\\". Miraculously, then, Kid A is perhaps the most cohesive album I've ever heard, brimming with forceful, brilliantly rendered soundscapes that offer new pleasures with every listen.    Take \\"Idioteque\\", the album's most propulsive offering. Unfamiliar chirps are choked by a menacing, insistent beat. The atmosphere is urgent in its paranoia but the beat invites you to move with it. Suddenly, Yorke's fevered vocal starts and any inclination you might have had to dance is immediately gone. Instead, you want to listen. What world is this, with women and children in bunkers and an ice age in sight? Whose children are deaf and lost?    By conceiving a post-apocalyptic sound that prized dense and cerebral tension over traditional song structure and musicality, Radiohead effectively changed what commercially viable music could sound like. They blew open the door for artists who have experimented with icy electronics while recalling the paranoid frenzy of some of rock and roll's greats; here, then, is the missing link between Unknown Pleasures and Silent Shout. Kid A is Radiohead's magnum opus, a testament to the unending possibilities of the creative mind and perhaps the most influential release of the decade.
B0013D8LOK|2.0|I think it's the Germans who have the saying, \\"Revenge is black pudding.\\"  Revenge movies and stories are popular because they are so simple and viscerally powerful: who couldn't identify with a long-suffering protagonist who's been wrongfully victimized and is out for some payback?  There are few human reflexes as powerful and universal as \\"an eye for an eye\\" or, in this post-9/11 age, \\"a dozen eyes for an eye.\\"<br /><br />And yet, this movie manages to do it.  Sure, the visuals are flawless being a Tim Burton film, and the two leads (Johnny Depp and the always-fabulous Helena Bonham Carter) are flawless as well---but this movie just drags along, inevitably I suppose since it's a musical which is a lousy format for an action-based revenge flick, and the climax is downright anti-climactical, while the ending is abrupt and equally unsatisfying.  The violence and blood are somehow stripped of any FUN---it happens way too fast too often, without much buildup, no primal glee or flourish, but is rather clinical and cursory instead.  Generally, the plot relies far too much on improbable coincidences and fortuitous and unfortuitous events---nobody really DOES anything except the villain, and even he is luck-driven half the time.<br /><br />Tarantino's first film, \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" was criticized by some for being an exercise in pointless violence because all the principal characters perished at the end, but it managed to grab the viewer by the throat from the beginning and never let go until the final credits.  Instead, \\"Sweeny Todd\\" is the kind of movie that makes you want to continually get up and go to the bathroom or the refrigerator because it's so damn slow and the musical format is hideously inefficient at developing characters or present plot twists, while musically being too mediocre to make you NOT care about its slowness.<br /><br />I suppose this film MIGHT be somewhat forgiven if you could convince me that Tim Burton deliberately set out to create an anti-revenge revenge movie that is INTENDED to be unsatisfying, as a moral point or commentary of some sort.  Maybe there is some sort of \\"cumbiyah\\" hidden in the subtext, the usual pious pronouncements that \\"an eye for an eye makes the world go blind\\" or \\"hate destroys both the hated and and the hater,\\" or (remember your elementary school teacher?) \\"two wrongs don't make a right.\\"  In that case we could congratulate him on his noble intentions, at the very least...because as a viewing experience, this film is an unmitigated disaster.that is INTENDED to be unsatisfying, as a moral point or commentary of some sort.

B001G1ACVY|5.0|This set comes with three disks: the CD of studio recordings; the CD of live recordings from selected performances; and the DVD of a concert.  It is worth the extra cabbage for sure, the concert is fantastic.      If you're a fan, you must have your own copy of this set--splurge for the three-disk set.  If you're a new listener, this is the studio album to buy.    Normally, I listen to Mraz's live recordings because they are unique, creative, and alive with the participation of fans.  With these songs however, the lyrics are nearly outdone by the instrumentals.  The studio versions are perfect blends: making incredibly dance-able tracks.  You won't be able to sit still through Butterfly, Make it Mine, or especially The Dynamo of Volition.  Even while driving, your shoulders will cascade through these clever beats.    Highly recommended.
159448385X|5.0|I was prepared for a let down after reading Hosseini's The Kite Runner - the proverbial sophomore jinx - but was bowled over by this book. It surpasses his first effort, and I have not been so moved by a piece of fiction since Ian McEwan's Atonement. It also added to my developing interest in Central Asia, and Islamic culture, and galvanized my belief that the United States absolutely must continue to assist Afghanistan in its efforts to rebuild - that country has seen too much war, and the work by Hosseini helps - though it is a fictional story - to reach everyday people and tell the story of that country and its long-suffering citizens. The book can be emotionally harsh - especially if you have small children - but that is why it is so engaging and why the reader comes to care for characters and their destinies.

0061139378|4.0|What a creepy little story; written for children it's a fantasy tale adults will enjoy it too.<br /><br />Coraline has moved with her parents into an old house that has been divided up into several flats.  She is happy to spend her days exploring outside and meeting her new neighbors.  On a rainy day with nothing to do Coraline explores her flat, and discovers a door that opens upon a brick wall. Her mother explains that it was closed up when the house was divided. Fascinated by this door Coraline decides to explore it one day when her dad is too busy working and her mom has gone shopping. Only this time when she opens the door it opens on a flat that is the mirror image of her own. Things seem a lot more fun on this side of the door, everyone is nicer to her, her room is prettier, everyone says her name correctly and even the food is tastier. Except for one problem, Coraline's other mother and other father don't seem to want to let her go back home to her real parents. They want to keep her forever and make her their own little girl.  Worst of all they don't have real eyes, just shiny black button eyes.<br /><br />Lots of creepy little things that go bump in the night populate this book. But the best part of the book is Coraline herself. She is brave, even when she is most afraid; and above all she is clever. She is going to need all of that bravery and all of her brains to get herself back home because her real parents have disappeared and Coraline is the only one who can save them.<br /><br />I can see my children really loving this book when they were younger. It's full of lots of creepy rats, spooky mirrors and mysterious basements, trap doors and a mean `witch'. It's also got a lot of humor in it. It reminded me a lot of Roald Dahl's darker children's books and my girls adored them. It might be a bit scary for really young children but most kids and adults will love it.
B0019FUFM8|1.0|This is the third movie I've rented based on a trailer that has nothing to do with the movie. Of course, I didn't know that until after I had rented the movie.

B000001E21|4.0|I'm not really going to say anything that hasn't been said in any other review already. But something happened to DL from 1983 to 1987. No, I don't think it has anything to do with Rick's Arm. No I don't think it has anything to do with Phil being added to the mix.<br /><br />The tranisition from Hysteria to Pyromania was a wierd one. With Pyro you have a band that basically rocked the whole way through. Loud guitars, loud vocals. Singable songs. Then Hysteria comes along and even though it sounds like Def Leppard, it's actually kind of lame. I know I know... without it the band wouldn't be known today.<br /><br />But when you listen to it now, it's really kind of cheesy. Pour some sugar on me? Armageddon it? It's like middle age rock. haha Something I\\"d picture my dad listening to. What happened to the tranistion between Pyro and Hysteria? Retro active.<br /><br />With this CD you get the rock-ness of Pyro with the sound of Hysteria. I think this album should have been Hysteria. Of course, they never would have been as big because the songs aren't as radio friendly but some of them are really good. If you would have put Animal, Hysteria, Gods of War, and Pour some sugar (just for radio popularity) on a CD with Ring of Fire, Desert Song, Fractured Love and Ride into the sun you've have a really good album. The other songs are pretty forgetable but it's worth it for those four.<br /><br />DL definitely has a distinct sound. You hear them you know who's playing and yeah their sound, sounds dated today. But this album is vintage DL and plus the cover is probably their coolest since Pyromania. ha.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This movie was great on dvd but the Blu-ray is even better and looks awesome.   Our boys can't get enough of it even 3 weeks after Christmas.
B0000041Z6|3.0|Sir Georg Solti's 'in your face' approach is here most evident, one he employed in many recordings of operatic and orchestral works.  Sometimes it works, when Mahler is at his most bombastic, but it fails when Mahler becomes more introspective.      I bought this set many years ago for the playing of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of the best in the world when these recordings were made, in 1970-71 and 1980-83.  And I was not disappointed.  The sound is excellent; and the price for this set was fairly competitive.        The most irritating feature of this set is how the symphonies are cut up, butchered, so that most of them are spread over two discs.  Only Nos 1, 4, 5, and 6, are contained on a single disc.  Strange, since even the longer symphonies, such as No 2 (Resurrection) and No 8 (Of a Thousand) have been released individually on a single CD.      Solti does provide us with some superb interpretations, however.  Symphony No 8 stands out, for example, one of the most difficult concert works to pull together successfully.  But, better to purchase individual recordings of the symphonies, featuring your favourite interpreters.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|[[ASIN:B001GZ6QDS The Dark Knight]] is a very impressive follow up to [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins]].  This is one of those rare movies that can be enjoyed by fans of the original comic book series and those completely oblivious to the various sub-plots of Batman's legacy.  The acting is largely very well done and most of the story elements are very well put together.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />This installment in the series re-introduces Heath Ledger as \\"The Joker\\" in a role that will be often discussed and deservedly so.  But the story is more complex than the Joker alone, and plays on the various psychological games that he plays on Gotham's various groups, including the public, the police, organized crime and Batman himself.  In that sense, there is a great deal of depth to the story that makes it easy to suspend disbelief considering not everybody is quick to believe comic-book plot-lines.<br /><br />But there are also several unanswered questions about the story and the fates of some of its characters.  Long time Batman fans will be more aware of some of the minor departures from the original stories, but it's impossible to discuss them without spoiling the plot.  By and large, the areas where the story is altered are well done.  Just be prepared for some nagging questions at the end that are certain to be answered by one or more sequels.<br /><br />THE CAST<br /><br />The casting is top notch.  Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman turn in great performances in their roles, mostly static carry-overs from \\"Batman Begins.\\"  And Aaron Eckhart is wonderful in his role as Harvey Dent, so much so that he could have certainly been nominated for several awards as well. But perhaps the one role that I was not entirely happy with was that of Rachel, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  While she is certainly a capable actress, I found most of her scenes showed little range or emotion.  I have to wonder if the part was written that way or if she simply underplayed the role.  In any case, these are very small details considering that her role is still serviceable and doesn't detract from the story.<br /><br />THE CAMERA WORK AND SOUND<br /><br />The other element that should be considered with this movie is the extremely dark colors and shadows used throughout the film, perhaps to symbolic effect.  \\"Batman Begins\\" was very dark, but this takes that morbid darkness to another level.  The camera work and lighting are excellent.  But the quality of your home screen will greatly influence your ability to appreciate the visuals of this movie.  Be prepared to watch this movie in absolute darkness.  Also be ready for a sound mix that alternates somewhat between low dialogue and the loud sounds of gunfire and explosions.<br /><br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />The Two-Disc Special Edition includes some extras and a \\"Digital Copy,\\" a convenient way to get a DRM accepted version of the film for your mobile devices.  You still have to enter in a special code, which is included, in order to obtain and access the copy.<br /><br />There are also six individual scenes from the IMAX wide-screen, though you have to play them one by one.  Standard galleries are included with production stills and poster art. We also have the \\"Gotham Tonight\\" news features with surprise appearances by none other than Anthony Michael Hall.  Those features are actually great to watch with those less familiar with the Batman story before watching the movie.<br /><br />The \\"Gotham Uncovered\\" extra includes two parts: \\"The Evolution of the Knight\\" covers some of the details on the new suit and Bat-pod, and \\"The Sound of Anarchy\\" includes a nice discussion on the score as created by Hans Zimmer, which is very good. The thing that I noticed most about \\"The Sound of Anarchy\\" is Hans Zimmer's impressive editing and mixing workstation.<br /><br />But the extras of disk two may still fall short of the impressive extras that were included with the [[ASIN:B0017HPHBM Batman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set)]].  So while this is still a very good release, many will want to buy the widescreen edition for now and save their money for the next special edition that is likely to come or the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This film is an achievement.  I only wish that I could have seen it in the IMAX release. This may be a movie worth upgrading to high-definition Blu-Ray for. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Enjoy.good release, many will want to buy the widescreen edition for now and save their money for the next special edition that is likely to come or the Blu-Ray release.

B000FZETKC|5.0|Im tellin ya. you could go to amazon.com type in john hughes and pick random john hughes movies without even looking at the plot and always come out with a great movie.  hes just that talented.    again he reaches in and hits the nail on the head basically making a window in to what its like to be a teenager.  nowadays movies are so \\"slap in the face\\".  really no enjoyment in alot of them.  john hughes knows how to be both subtle and magical all at the same time.  some kind of wonderful is my top favorite john hughes 80s flick.   it has more soul to it in my opinion.  he works around the music so well that the soundtrack becomes unforgetful.    keith and watts are best friends.  they have been forever.  them hormones are a kickin and their kicking fast.  keith has a thing for the most beautiful (and most popular) girl at school amanda jones.  hes financially pretty much lower middle class.  (lets just say him and watts arent standing on the side of the road with will work for food signs and arent poor but they havent had life handed to them.) amanda is about the same but she \\"runs with the rich and the beautiful..-watts\\" .  amandas boyfriend hardy is a creep and runs around on her.  keith pops in and gets a date with her which she takes because shes mad with hardy.  watts is and has always been in love with keith which keith doesnt seem to see tho its totally obvious to the viewer. mary stuart is magical as watts and the chemistry between her and eric stoltz as keith shines right through the tv.  this is a truly beautiful movie so quit reading and buy it already.
B00002N9ER|3.0|This product is exactly what the description states.  The clips are not extremely strong, but will get the job done under normal use.  Probably the best option for mounting a maglite to a surface.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|This wonderful series is marred by the fact that it is in a format that is now outmoded...and most consummers do not have the equipment to show it...HD DVD I had to return mine for the same reason.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Get it. That's all I have to say and I rarely say anyting in this joint.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies to come out in the last 4 decades.  The quality of the product was outstanding.

B000FZETIO|5.0|pretty in pink is my next in line favorite john hughes film second best to some kind of wonderful.  his movies fall together so well.  a killer soundtrack.  great acting and every film has its own kind of magic.   pretty in pink being the story of a girl andie whos had the same best friend \\"forever\\" duckie who of course is totally in love with her.  she doesnt feel the same way but would never in a million years want to hurt him.  her other \\"best bud\\" is played by a very young annie potts (designing women) who is as eccentric as they come and (tho they never really get into the subject) runs the record shop where a decent portion of the movie takes place.  where takes place my top favorite scene where duckie does a hilarious and yet adorable reinactment of otis reddings \\"try a little tenderness\\".  a scene that pays for the price of the movie on its own.  but if the movie went that way forever it wouldnt go anywhere but some good laughs and unreturned crushes. tho rich in love they dont have any money and the rich brats at school bully them.  particularly when rich boy blaine falls hard for andie and andie doesnt exactly dislike him either.  jealousy ensues and it makes for a really great movie and a certain movie to cherish if youve ever fallen in love with your best friend or someone who your friends hate and be honest \\"who hasnt?\\"
1401307450|5.0|What better to be said about a book then i couldn't put it down. I kept reading parts outloud to my girlfriend, and all she could say was oh-my-god.  And if you're kind of a fan before reading it you'll be a huge fan after. And if you grew up in L.A. it's a kick to read about the places AK lived, bought drugs, played music,  from Topanga Cyn. to Hollywood.   So, stop reading reviews and buy this book. I would also recommend Eric Clapton's new book \\"Clapton.\\"  Eric's and Anthony's struggles with band members and drugs are eerily similiar. I hereby predict that one day they will get together. One small little correction, on page 380, it's Jan and Dean, not the Beach Boys, Anthony.
0671646788|5.0|I read tons of LOA books and this one is on my top 10 list, maybe even top 5. A lot of examples, very easy to read and understand. Like one simple thing I got from it - do what you can do NOW(don't think it is too small of the thing, it won't work out, just do it and then universe will allign to help you.)Sitting and dreaming alone won't change things. Dreaming and doing what feels good now(inspired action) - will.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I ordered this on a Wednesday, and got it on a Friday! I love Friends so much, and I can't pick a favorite Friend! I love them all. I wish they were still on TV!!! I can't wait to have a Friends marathon, and watch all the DVD's!! :0)
0316017922|3.0|This book was interesting.  Showed a new way of looking at previously unknown factors impacting \\"success\\" in life.  Did it cause me to do something different?  No.  Was it worth my time to read?  It's OK for cocktail party chit chat, but once you get past the major point, its redundent.
B000P1QMZ6|5.0|I loved it! I read the book first and loved the book as well. I liked every single bit in the movie. It's good because it was exciting, interesting. I like the characters, especially Harry Potter. The acting is great. I almost never watch movies more than once but this one I want to watch again as soon as it is finished. If my parents didn't control my tv/computer time to a half an hour a day on weekdays and an hour on weekends, I would be watching it all the time if I wasn't playing hockey.  My parents just got it for an early birthday present because I had to return the library copy.  Read the book first and if you like it, definitely watch the movie. You won't be disappointed!
1423101464|5.0|My 11 year old son is an \\"anti-reader\\".  He thinks reading is boring and stupid.  Then he found the Percy Jackson series.  He has devoured these books in the last month or so.  He is nearly finished the Battle of the Labyrinth, and I hope we can find another series that he will enjoy as much.  It has been truly amazing to see him READING instead of watching TV in the evenings.  We are looking forward to the 5th book coming out.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great controller.  Actually there aren't many choices out there.  I got scared away from the reviews of the other non-Sony controllers.  Since this is on sale from Amazon, it was only a bit more expensive than the others, so the decision to buy this was easy.
B001HN697C|3.0|If you enjoyed the other two films in the Underworld series you will probably find more to like than hate with this prequel. Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen are back and elevate even the most lackluster dialogue, while Rhona Mitra makes a good replacement for Kate Beckinsale. The CGI and pratical effects are blended nicely, but this movie is just so dark and edited with so many quick cuts it's hard to see what's going on during most of the fight scenes. We also know who is going to live and die, so there is little suspense or wonder at all when swords clash between main characters who we know are around in the other movies.<br /><br />While Underworld: Rise of the Lycans doesn't break any new ground, it was nice to see the back story played out. If you are a huge fan of the series, it might be worth a trip to the theater, otherwise I recommend you wait for the DVD.
0545128285|4.0|J. K. Rowling's fertile imagination cannot be contained in the mere seven volumes of the  Harry Potter series.  Here it overflows into the wizarding world's equivalent of Aesop's Fables-five tales of knights and ladies, evil villains and wise conquerors,  foolish risks and daring rescues.  The last tale will be familiar to readers of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" but the rest are unrelated, although they feature spells and \\"magical creatures\\" that fans will recognize.  Of course, like all fables, these tales have morals, which are explained in \\"commentaries\\" attributed to Albus Dumbledore.   For those unfamiliar with Rowling's work, this isn't the place to begin; for her existing legion of readers, however, it's like a bon bon after a banquet.
B000BTC5LW|2.0|\\"Pink Floyd\\" without Roger Waters is not Pink Floyd, and this concert demonstrates exactly why.  The performances are slick and soulless; the remaining three band members go through the motions without much emotion or chemistry, as most of the emotional power and angst that characterized classic Pink Floyd came from the genius of Waters.    The over-the-top light show is ridiculous but serves effectively to distract the viewer from the mediocre musical performance.    This is a flashy, carefully-produced presentation of Pink Floyd music by three talented guys, but it feels like a stale nostalgia act when stripped of the gravitas, poetry and feeling that Waters brought to the band.  These are great songs, no doubt, and it's nice to watch Gilmour lay it down on lead guitar.  However at the end of the day it just feels like more spectacle than substance.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I've always wanted to get this set but didn't want to pay the price.  A friend recommended that I buy it used through amazon.com.  I did for a fraction of the original price.  I was so surprised that when I received the set it looked brand new.  I'm almost afraid to watch them because I don't want to ruin the beautiful book it comes in.  I loved this entire series and I am so excited to watch marathons of the ORIGINALS with my friends.
0553381687|5.0|I first came across A Game of Thrones ten years ago when I was still in high school. At that time I was still not entirely comfortable with the English language, and I was going through the library picking up easy books to read, which usually tend to be in the fantasy section. The kind of books where a young boy is helped by a wizard and some other mythological creatures to become all he can be... a king or hero of some sort.  So, it was by pure chance that I picked up GRRM's masterpiece. My only regret is that I did not play the lottery that day.  That summer day, I embarked on one of the most rewarding reading experiences of my life.<br /><br />There is not much I can say about this book that hasn't been said already.  Its epic scope is unparalleled; its characterization is far superior to any in fantasy, and in par with the best fiction of any genre; and Martin's style of writing creates the perfect balance between grand storytelling and individual examination. There is such a vivid description of everything from the terrain, the castles and cities, and the people...so so many people; I have to look back at War and Peace to come up with comparative dramatis personae.  The very thought that such an intricate world could really be encompassed by a fantasy writer is audacious. However, Martin did not just whip the Seven Kingdoms out of thin air. In fact, there are many real-life historical correlations to the world where the story is set, starting with the very map (which you can try and figure out with a mirror or a bit of imagination).  But do not be fooled, this is not historical fiction, nor would I say this is fantasy.  What GRRM has done, is create his own genre, fantasy so real that it transcends the genre, and puts swords and sorcery, albeit a large dose of the first and minimal sprinklings of the second, to the forefront of contemporary fiction.<br /><br />Believe the hype, for it really is as good as it sounds.  I purposefully will not give away any plot related information, because I think this book should be read with as little foreknowledge as possible, for that way, with every turn of the page you will be amazed. It is probably best if I provide a personal example.  I have a very long list of books that I intend to read, on top of that I have an exhaustive curriculum in grad school, and yet I found the time to re-read Game of Thrones ten years later, not simply to refresh my memory, but because when a tapestry is as rich as the one that Martin weaves, one can't help but admire its beauty time and time again.ion, because I think this book should be read with as little foreknowledge as possible, for that way, with every turn of the page you will be amazed.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is absolutely a masterpiece. This is not just a kid's movie that an adult can also enjoy, it's more of the reverse. A sign that the people at Pixar are not just great animators but deep thinkers as well. This movie almost reminds me of A.I., not sure if A.I. indeed provided some inspiration for this movie.
0312383320|5.0|I own everyone of Evanovich's Plum books and this is the best one in a long time.  It seems that since number 10 on the books have not been up to the normal par.  This gives me great hope for number 15 coming out this June.
B000069KGM|5.0|I remember when my family bought this album along with several others from a record club in 1969. Even my parents liked it, since it sounded somewhat like Big Band music, with a rock beat.<br /><br />This first Chicago album has a couple of hits on it, along with other, little-known pieces, rounding out this collection of 1960's music.<br /><br />This is Chicago's best album, next to Chicago II. Their other albums are crummy, in my opinion.
B001CU1RRM|4.0|Great CD. All of MJ's great hits.  The whole family is singing and dancing along (12 year old to 54 year old). My copy skips at a couple points.  I'll have to check and see if it's the CD or my player.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I guess I really should have looked deeper into Pink's music cause I would have discovered A LONG TIME AGO that this girl can rock. She's brutally honest and open, has a tremendous voice, and this album hasn't left my cd player since I got it.. She's a new personal fave artist for me. I can't wait to get the rest of her albums. And if you wanna see this gal rock, get her Wembley Stadium concert dvd. This is where I saw what kind of talent she had and I was immediately won over. I'd only ever heard Get The Party Started, and tho that's a great tune, truthfully there isn't ONE BAD SONG on this album. She's sexy, she rocks and I can't say enough about how much fun this album is. But don't take my word for it.. check it out yourself!
B001D08SK0|1.0|The disks in this box set contain fantastic material.  Unfortunately, both the original and the replacement set I received from Amazon contained scratched DVDs & CDs, both contained warped vinyl lps, and on one side of one of the LPs, the stamper had operated off center.  Amazon sold this set about $30.00 cheaper than anywhere else.    My impression is that these were B-stock offers.
006112429X|4.0|I really liked this book for several reasons. Lionel Shriver doesn't try to *trick* or talk down to the reader. She has created a character (Eva) who is not only brutally honest, but makes no apologies. Eva is not a sympathetic character and I really appreciated that. A book about 'blah blah blah - violence in schools - blah blah blah - why why why?' could so easily have been cliche but Shriver takes a completely different approach to an already overplayed topic. What if your child is truly a bad seed? What if his sociopathic tendencies have been so cleverly executed that your family thinks you are the crazy one and not your son? Eva talks at length, honestly and openly, about how from the minute her son was born she never felt an attachment to him. She never directly questions why her son did what he did. In many ways, she is as emotionally cold and detached as Kevin. Even her relationship with her daughter is without extreme emotion. What makes this book so creepy is that Eva never truly makes the connection just how alike she and her son are. Also, I liked that Kevin did not fall into the stereotype of 'school shooter'. Even better, he didn't use a gun. He's a very interesting character study -- not your typical 'oh poor me, the world is out to get me, i wear trench coats and black coats to stand out and I have access to a gun' character. Shriver has created a sociopath who deserves his own follow up novel.<br />I never thought that Eva's journey was cathartic nor did I think that Shriver was disguising the fact that the letters Eva writes were to her deceased husband. I think Eva wanted to put her journey in writing in hopes of having a better understanding. There is no answer to why kids act the way they do. And Kevin is an entirely different breed of interesting and terrifying kid. Eva has nothing left to lose, so through her letters she can express the utmost honesty. I believe that she did love her husband, but Shriver never makes this relationship overdramtic, in keeping with Eva's nature.ic, in keeping with Eva's nature.
1401219268|5.0|I am very excited for the movie as from the previews it appears to hold VERY true to the original Gibbons graphic novel.  Even if you are not a graphic novel fan, Watchmen is an entertaining book with many mini stories within that all come together in the end for a very shocking ending.  With all the hype I was afraid I would be disappointed but to the contrary.
0316113077|3.0|A nice book with beautiful pictures(though many of the big cakes probably made on styrofoam dummies for the perfect look, which is a little different from reality).  The big thing missing is information on gumpaste. There are many kinds of, and each one has it's own advantages(modeling paste, flower paste, mexican paste). No recipe has been given(while some are very easy to make).  On the other hand, there is a recipe for rolled fondant in the book. That is far more difficult to make(you need a heavy duty mixer and complete control of temperature) and if something goes wrong, you end up with a large quantity of a messy product.
0061122416|3.0|After hearing so much about this book I finally sat down and gave it a read on a flight recently. The fable is pretty basic and presented in a nice way but I'm sorry, it's not the great work of literature that most say it is. Sure, it is an interesting read but nothing life changing.    It's not a waste of your time to read but only a far left liberal would give it so much credit as to rate it 5 stars. I gave 3 but would of gone with 3.5 if that was an option.
0307341550|4.0|What a fantistic debut novel! Creepy mother, dead sister, eery 13 year old half sister who alternates from sing-song childishness to drugs and promiscuity. A murder mysetery in a small town. A protagonist who carves words on her body. I am the complete target audience for this book. What's not to love?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We couldn't find this for Christmas, but went on line Christmas day onto your site and found it. It is a great piece of photography.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|Avril went from being a person with personality to your average new age pop star. Her songs used to be meaningful, but on this CD she just wrote random stuff. The songs are catchy, but I miss the old sound,you know when the words where emotional and purposeful. When I first heard this CD I was like who is this? I hated that she sounded like a pop singer want to be, instead of an idividual pop star. She had no meaning in most of the songs. This CD was nothing speacial, not compaired to her other CD's.
B001G0LBZ6|4.0|This is a fun CD, if you like these sort of tunes. If you like Rammstein or even Sonic Youth, probably best to stay away. I put this CD on in my car and sing along, it's a great CD, with beautifully written tracks. Obviously if you loved Juno the movie, you'll love the soundtrack which in my opinion delivered another layer to the screenplay.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I purchased this as a gift to my cousin for Christmas and he is very pleased. Come on, who wouldn't be, it's The Godfather!
031606792X|5.0|I loved this series of books. I am 45 but couldn't put them down. I am not sure what it was about these books that kept me hooked, but I loved them.
141690977X|5.0|I am not cynical. I consider myself a happy-go-lucky person that looks for the best in others. Before reading this book, I thrived on making excuses for men who at the end of the day, just weren't as interested in me as I was in them. Is it true that every man that didn't contact me after I met them wasn't interested? Probably not, but that's not the point; why should I waste time thinking about someone who is kinda-sorta interested, when I can ignore them and focus on the calls from the genuinely interested? The authors of \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" are 100% correct about one thing: obeying the rules of this book is liberating. I will never again care about a man that doesn't call, or doesn't call back. Their loss, not mine.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|I had rented all four series through Netflix and really enjoyed this one the most purely because of the hilarious and brilliant acting of Catherine Tate. If you buy only one of the box sets as I did, this is the one to get. I especially love the back and forth banter between the Doctor and Donna ragging on each other and praising in turns as true friends do without all the romantic entanglements of the previous series.
031606792X|1.0|I was so enchanted by the first 3 books in this series. I stayed up for two weeks straight because I couldn't put them down.  I found myself laying in bed every night being taunted by the book on the night-stand, until I became overwhelmed and turned the light back on to finish chapter after chapter.  I thought Meyer had a remarkable talent for drawing the audience into the story and keeping the reader's heart pounding with every page turned.      Now that I am reading Breaking Dawn, I can hardly finish it. The first 100 pages had my attention, but as soon as Bella & Edward come back from their \\"vacation\\" the entire storyline takes a bad turn. Pages 145-327 are thoroughly unnecessary and could have been summed up in 5 pages or less...I think Meyers was just trying to fill some space and couldn't figure out how to pull this thing off. Not to mention, the editor of this novel should have been fired for allowing so much useless chatter to be included in this book.  What a waste of ink and my time...I had the same feeling as if I was stuck in the car with somebody on a long road-trip to nowhere and I couldn't get out!      Now I am on page 510 and I am having a terrible time finishing this novel.  I just want to get it over with so that I can see how it ends (even though it has become completely predictable so far and I am already sure how it ends).  Meyer claims that this book was supposed to \\"tie\\" everything together.  Unfortunately,she lost character credibility every step of the way. I know a vampire and wherewolf story doesn't seem believable, but in the first 3 books it felt magically real. Now in Breaking Dawn it makes me roll my eyes every time a character speaks. There is nothing believable about this book...it doesnt' even let me pretend. I almost feel like a different writer (other than Meyer) actually wrote this book and that he/she didn't really know or understand the characters as the rest of us did.  What a sad disappointment!  If I were you, wait to buythis one on the used list. Don't pay top dollar.
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|I had to buy this to add it to my DVD collection. I would have kicked myself in the you know what if I hadn't. I have watched it, but my husband hasn't yet. I honesty looked at the film as a depiction of de Sade's sick mind, and well, it worked. It's still screwed up, but if you decided to watch the film, you knew that before you started watching it, and if you didn't, I'm not sorry.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Well worth the price. Outstanding history lesson of the John Adams period. Anyone interested in American History will enjoy it.
B000003TA4|5.0|What more can be said about this album, of which so much has already been written?  Here's one interesting tidbit.    I have an early pressing of the CD, before \\"Endless, Nameless\\" was added at the end as a bonus track.  The credits state: \\"All song lyrics by Kurt Cobain / Music by Nirvana.\\"  This was still in the early Geffen days when they decided to split compositional credit equally.    Once it became obvious to Kurt just how big Nirvana was going to be, he forced a contract change which required the majority of all compositional credit to be given exclusively to him, both going forward and retroactively.  The implication is that he felt he did most of the creative work anyway, and he would quit the band if the other members did not agree.  Newer pressings, probably including the one offered new on Amazon, will give full musical credit to Kurt for everything except \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", where he graciously allowed the other guys to retain their share.    Maybe Kurt was the driving force behind these songs.  Maybe Krist and Dave did little more but help arrange the bass and drum parts for the tunes that Kurt wrote.  It's just amazing that such a development would occur after an album has been released, which is when most people would think that these issues have already been decided for perpetuity.  After all, he couldn't gather up all of the old pressings and exchange them.  And so, the legend remains.

031606792X|5.0|By far the best of Meyers saga. It was a little rushed but..very good.. some was a little far out there but its supposed to be..hello its fantasy anything goes. With her fans its a bout half and half..half were extremly dissapointed with the book and the other half absolutly loved the book. I personally loved it. and honestly if you didnt..im sorry thats your problem..and another thing i keep seeing these reviews about how bad her writing is and seriously these people must be english professors or something because i saw absolutly nothing wrong with her sentences and the way she wrote. i personally think she described everything great and wrote a great story. I love this book and would recommend it too anyone.

0375826726|2.0|I loved the first two books and waited anxiously for this book.  At this point, I am forcing myself to finish this book.  This was to be his last book of the series and should have been.  The story wanders.  It gets bogged down in details that add nothing.  I'll finish it and will certainly buy the next book but as with many successful series it appears as if the author is \\"milking\\" the story so that he can write another book.  Very tedious and extremely disappointing.

159448385X|3.0|This book was:    -Slow to start  -Very depressing.......  -Very tragic    It did pick up about half way through the book but it really was a sad and depressing read unlike the Kite Runner.  I definitely enjoyed the Kite Runner better.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|A friend of mine turned me on to the DTB band a couple of years ago by introducing me to the \\"Songlines\\" CD.   I really enjoyed that one and was delighted when I heard that they had a new CD out.    I have played this constantly since I got it and it is helping me get through the waiting period for the next Springsteen CD next week.    As one reviewer noted, this is more \\"mainstream\\" than other DTB CD's.  However, that is not a bad thing IMHO.  When scanning the other reviews I also noted like another reviewer did that several reviews said Derek did not play very much(???).   I have to agree with his statement to these folks .. What CD were you listening to?     Derek's playing is superb througout and he steps up on almost all the tracks.   I think that because his sound melds so well with the band and does not dominate the sound, some may feel he is not tearing it up.  Oh well, different strokes...    It is hard to single out any one track for me as I enjoyed each one.  If you put a gun to my head and say I could pick a few, I guess I'd say \\"Down in the Flood\\", \\"Sweet Inspiration\\", and \\"Get What You Deserve\\".  The two songs that Doyle Bramhall sang on were fine, but it would have interesting to hear Mike Mattison sing lead.    As I am writing this I have the DTB playing a mini set live on NPR.   Great Stuff!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|If you liked Supernatural Season 1, this is a must see. While season one was about mainly things you've heard of and never thought were true, this season is more aimed toward demons and learning about Sam's ability.  Definitely a great season.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|The best way I can describe Star Trek V:The Final Frontier is, the movie was RUSHED! At that time, Paramount Pictures was looking for a movie that could compete with Warner Brothers' release of the new Batman movie, starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Paramount was hoping, this latest edition of the Star Trek movies, would do the job. Their plans backfired! Batman was well received and did exetremely well at the Box Office. If Star Trek V had been given more time during production and released at a later date, I believe the movie would have been better received. The weakiness in the movie, was the script and with the sub-par special effects. Star Trek's appeal to its fan base, has always been, its special effects. If Industrial Light & Magic had done the special effects for this installment of Star Trek, the movie would have been better received. The storyline involving the Klingons, could have been better defined. The strengths of the movie, focused on the main characters, especially Kirk, Spock & McCoy. The other strength, was Lawrence Luckinbill's portrayal of Sybok. His portrayal of Spock's full blooded Vulcan brother, was excellent. With Sybok's telepathic powers, Kirk,Spock and McCoy, had to deal with the demons of their past,including Spock's inner conflict regarding his mixed heritage. The end of the movie, should have been on the lines of classic Star Trek. The Enterprise's return to Spacedock complete its refit would have more appropriate than a camp fire scene at Yosemite National Park.   Star Trek V:The Final Frontier was rushed into production in order for the movie to compete with Batman. If Star Trek V had been given more time regarding script development, production, post production, the use of Industrial Light & Magic to provide the special effects and the movie was released at a later date, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier would have been a better movie and did well at the Box Office. To rate this movie higher than 3 stars, would be a stretch!
0790749858|4.0|This happened to be on TV one day, and nearly over, when my 5yr old grandaughter walked in, became mezmorized, and asked for it for her B-day.  Well... it's an old movie, and not easy to find.  I looked for it at all the mainstream video stores, found it here on Amazon, gave it to her for her B-day over a year ago, and she loved it.  Now her little brother is hooked on it.  The great combination of sports, famous athletes, and animation, is a perfect blend for the little ones.
B000MV8ABS|3.0|What better to do on a freezing cold January evening then watch a tripped out 70's horror? After finding out the legendary Joe Bob Briggs had done a couple films in the series on Monstervision way back when we figured it was a no brainer. Now 70's horror is really hit or miss but luckily this one was pretty creepy.<br /><br />The film is based around 2 brothers Mike and Jody. Mike is the younger pain in the a** brother that follows big bro Jody around all the time. While being the little peep freak he is he spies on Jody as he attends a friends funeral only to see something odd. Once everyone has left he notices some really tall man, known as the Tall Man, taking the 500lb casket and launching it into the back of his hearst with ease. Now Mike and Jody go on a hunt of the mortician tall man and get themselves and their friends into a real mess. See the tall man doesn't play that game and sends his back of zombie elves, no relation to Sid, and a sweet flying orb that drills through skulls after the dynamic duo. The films really is all over the place and backs plenty of odd imagery. There were many times we looked at each other and wondered what the hell is going on? It may have been our current state of mind but we're pretty sure this one is tweaked to the max. Just right for the occasion.<br /><br />Overall the film was a fun watch. There were certainly some scares and moments of sheer confusion which adds up to what we're looking for in a b horror. It also had the Tall Man which promises to freak anybody out. The guy is like 8 ft tall and has all sorts of crazy powers. Someone you do not want to mess with. This is a guy that Santa would see coming and destroy a pair of FTL's only to swing them in a clear garbage bag overhead. We have to say this one is worth checking out. Now in honor of Joe Bob we're going to leave you with the Drive In Totals:<br /><br />18 zombie elves<br /><br />1 Clint Howard double<br /><br />1 Tall Man leaking yellow blood<br /><br />7.5 Mullets<br /><br />4 Breasts<br /><br />2 sweet explosions<br /><br />and one tripped out experience.ne tripped out experience.
B0002JP4L4|4.0|I cannot believe it has been 25 years ago that we watched this movie in the theatres!  Wow!   It caused an uproar then with our friends but today seems somewhat calm and shows that kids really need a little freedom of expression to do what comes naturally.  Of course, all within reason and respect.   Still a great movie to watch with your grandkids and talk about what things were like \\"back in the old days!\\"
B000G73UEU|3.0|Jennifer Warnes and Judy Collins should have been here to add a modicum of class to this project, but instead we are asked to endure C list musicians who cant carry a tune and are way out of their depth with Cohen's material. Left to their own devices they have recorded over an hours worth of criminal battery on Leonard Cohen songs... \\"in beautys disguise.\\" as it were.    Antony, U2, Perla Batalla and Teddy Thompson are the only artists that have coherent and vibrant contributions here.      Beth Orton needs to be put out of her misery. Martha Wainwright needs to be let in on the secret that \\"phrasing\\" is used to convey emotion... Is she the one that encouraged Rufus to participate here?? He is amoung the rest that offer slices of fresh hell to this misguided attempt at a tribute.     I missed the movie..I hope it came across better than this trainwreck of a record.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Kids will love this, as will parents and grandparents!  It is basically fun and a great adaptation of Dr. Suess' book.  Pixtar/Disney and Jim Carrey do a great job in bringing it to us for all to enjoy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD had me fooled! When I got it, I put it in my DVD player and watched it with the sound off while talking on the phone with a friend. I remember saying to him \\"Dang it! This DVD looks too easy, I have wasted my money\\". I also remember sending him a text message about half an hour later. The text message said (more or less) \\"this Jillian Michaels lady tried to kill me!\\". She had me from the pushups on the first workout! This DVD will certainly humble you if you think you are \\"in shape\\" (like I think I am. LOL!).   I've been doing the tape 2-3 times a week for about 2 weeks and I can tell I am getting accustomed to it. I did Workout 1 for 2 weeks and I did Workout 2 twice so far. I then went back to Workout 1 and was not sore at all, so you do get used to the workout. Good thing there are 3 workouts so that you can mix it up.   There are modifications for those of us that can't quite kick that high. I notice that some exercises I can do without modifications and some I have to modify. I guess we all have our strengths and weaknesses.   If you need a jump start to your workout or are in a slump, try this one!
B000CNFC76|4.0|This goes well with a matching movie - Bobby Jones, Stroke of Genius - the true story of a golf contest.   Even if you don't love golf, you'll enjoy it.  The story is based on a screenplay but Disney takes it one step further so you can enjoy it more.  Great photography, good acting, the drama is excellent.   Make this a family night with popcorn for the kids or grandkids!  It's fun!

B0002F6AZC|4.0|I think Creepshow is one of the best and most fun horror films of all time, so naturally Creepshow 2 was gonna have a hard time living up to it.  It doesn't help matters that the powerhouse writing/directing team of Stephen King and George Romero isn't here.  Well, sort of.  Romero takes writing duties(based on Stephen King stories) and the directing is left to Romero's DP, Michael Gornick.  It only has 3 stories instead of 5 and seems to be missing that tongue in cheek touch of the first film.<br />But I still love the movie!  The first story is about a cigar store wooden Indian that comes to life for some Charles Bronson-esque revenge when some hoodlums rob the general store and kill the owner, played by George Kennedy(\\"Be sure...Breath Assure!\\") and his wife.  The second story comes from King's short story collection, Skeleton Crew.  It's about two couples that drive out to a lake in October to swim out to a wooden raft in the middle of the lake.  Why?  I've never been quite sure.  You practically get cold watching them.  Once on the raft they are attacked by a round, black water creature that looks like a garbage bag half submerged in the water.  Like The Blob, it's hungry and eats anyone it can grab, or whoever gets too close to it.  The third story has a snooty, rich Lois Chiles hitting a hitchhiker on the highway.  She flees the scene, but the dead dude simply isn't gonna leave her alone, and she engages in a war/chase with the zombie-like hitchhiker.<br />Like the first film, these three stories are supposed to be from a comic book, but they are linked together by animated sequences involving Billy(the boy with the Creepshow comic in the first film) being harassed by bullies and getting his revenge.  Also in the animated sequences is \\"The Creep\\", a kind of Cryptkeeper character who introduces the stories.  This animation is the cause of some of the criticism of this movie.  I don't mind it terribly, but it is kinda unnecessary and seems there only to pad out running time.  If you ask me, the three stories are all rather solid.  A lot of folks don't particularly care for the first story, but in the immortal words of Meatloaf, \\"Two out of three ain't bad\\".  I actually like that first story very much.  \\"The Raft\\" is a great little tale that could have even made it into the first film.  Though it changes King's story a bit, it keeps the spirit of the story for sure(the Blob/garbage bag monster in the story had swirling colors in it's body that had a hypnotic, druglike effect on those who looked at it.  There was some sex and a different ending as well.  But the ending was anticlimactic for a film.  The movie's ending was great.).  The Hitchhiker segment is also quite strong and had the quirkiness of some of the stories in the first film like Father's Day and Something To Tide You Over.<br />Creepshow is one tough act to top, but Creepshow 2 ends up being a very entertaining film regardless.ng time.

B000007XUQ|5.0|I love the music of the Carpenters and had to have this for my Christmas music collection.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|There aren't too many films out there like Flash Gordon.  You've got a film with a big budget, a relatively unknown actor in the lead, and a soundtrack by Queen.  These are interesting, but it's not what I find the most fascinating.  What's fascinating is the style the film makers used.  The film is hilarious, one of the funniest films I've ever seen.  It's campy on purpose, but in a different way you're used to seeing.  It's not a spoof or a comedy, and the actors are not winking at the audience to let them in on the joke.  The actors are doing this straight faced, almost as if they are oblivious to the utterly ridiculous things they are saying.<br />Since the film is not blatantly stating to the audience that this is all tongue in cheek, it's easy for the casual viewer to see this movie as an attempt at a serious Sci-Fi film that ended up being corny and hokey through bad acting, directing and writing.  But you have to take a step back to see the big picture.  In reality the film is INTENDED to look like an attempt at a serious Sci-Fi film that ended up being corny and hokey through bad acting, directing and writing.  Genius if you ask me(but why the hell would you ask me?).  This can be credited in part to writer Lorenzo Semple Jr.  It becomes all the more clear when you find out that Semple wrote Batman The Movie and numerous episodes of the Batman television series.<br />For the uninitiated, Flash Gordon is a football star who finds himself and his new girlfriend \\"volunteering\\" for a mission to save the Earth, which has come under attack from the evil Emperor Ming.  Flash, Dale and Dr. Zarkov take a rocket to Mongo, where Ming rules with an iron fist(actually with a glowing ring that makes a cool noise every time he uses it).  Naturally everybody in this galaxy a zillion light years away speaks English(some of them even have British accents, making it all the more universal).  After escaping Ming's clutches, Flash forms an army made up of the feuding Kingdoms of Mongo.  Brian Blessed is Vultan, ruler of the flying hawk people, and Timothy Dalton is Prince Barin, who's planet is a big forest and inhabited by guys who wear green Robin Hood type outfits.  With the army assembled, Flash leads them to battle.<br />Like I said, the film is entertaining and fun as hell.  I loved this movie when I was a kid, and I probably love it even more now(which is a cool thing considering films loved as a child tend to be viewed in a different light when you're an adult).  Fortunately the film is again available on DVD(it went OOP a few years back).  Unfortunately the \\"special\\" edition isn't so special.  There's an interview with writer Semple, but little else.  At least we have the film back though.<br />See it soon!Brian Blessed is Vultan, ruler of the flying hawk people, and Timothy Dalton is Prince Barin, who's planet is a big forest and inhabited by guys who wear green Robin Hood type outfits.

1847242537|3.0|A fun read and an exciting page turner. Some of the resolutions to the plot were poorly handled and contrived, but Larsson is a very effective storyteller. As mentioned by other reviewers, the novel is a poor translation. The publisher should have paid a measly $100 to some 13 year old to proof read. Consistent usage of 'gaol' for 'jail' is just sloppy editing.
B0002WZTOI|3.0|Top Gun starring Tom Cruise was a huge hit when it was released in 1986. I like this movie for all the action and romance but I wouldn't say it is the best film of the decade. Too bad Kelly McGillis didn't have a lasting career, she is so confident and her performance is relaxed and subtle. I also enjoy Anthony Edwards in this, he's just a cool guy. Top Gun is fun for what it is but this blockbluster does have its flaws.

It makes many economical recommendations to help you wade through the myriad choices that exist in the dslr world.<br /><br />The book is laid out as if you are asking scott questions and he is answering them. It is not a book for someone who wants the nitty gritty technical detail of photography, more the type of book for someone who just wants to take good pictures.<br /><br />Scott is a good writer, and he is pretty funny, which helps keep your interest. It is very readable. I also recommend the sequel to this book.

0743270754|5.0|This was the first history book that I ever read straight through without breaking to read something else.  It really brings Abraham Lincoln to life and shows what it was about him that made him so great.  What was of the most value to me was showing how Lincoln handled his personal relationships.  Besides Lincoln, it's also a biography of the other men who were closest to him-- Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and especially William H. Seward, whom I really liked.  It's interesting to see how Lincoln tried to balance out his cabinet with people of different points of view, which Pres. Obama seems to be trying also, and I think an idea he got from this book.  Doris Kearns Goodwin said that writing this book made her a better person.  I think reading it made me a better person.<br />gaylealstrom.com
1568987846|3.0|I love the idea of this project, the beauty and simplicity of the pictures, how they synchronize sometimes and sometimes not.  I wish that the quality of the pictures was higher and the size of some of the pictures were bigger.  Perhaps it would have been to expensive to print glossy, high definition pictures but something was lost in the lower quality of reproductions.
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zep's last really great record is a lurching beast sprawled over 82 minutes, yet Page, Plant & Co. never seem to fall into excess.  Side two (\\"Houses of the Holy,\\" \\"Trampled Under Foot,\\" and the classic \\"Kashmir\\") is the most pointed and therefore the best, but they all have something going for them.  For those that dug their previous efforts, it's nirvana, covering all of their usual bases: bluesy laments (\\"Night Flight,\\" \\"Sick Again,\\" etc.), metal rockings (\\"Kashmir,\\" \\"The Wanton Song\\"), Tolkien-ish folk (\\"Bron-Yr-Aur,\\" \\"Down by the Seaside\\").  Better yet, the band's at the top of their game, especially Jimmy Page, who really lets 'er rip on this one.  I give it five stars, but I do so half-heartedly: it's a masterwork of hard rock, and it's one of the better rock records ever released, but it's all humanity and no human connection.  Even so, I bet the masses would be happy to hear Plant drown out my complaint with his wailing.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|This is an amazing film considering the year in which it was made.  The special effects are far ahead of its time.  Although the restoration isn't 100 percent it is amazing they saved what they did.  Every science fiction fan will recognize at least one plot device that started here and has been \\"borrowed from\\" time and time again.  It is thoughtful, the acting compelling in spite of it being a \\"silent\\" film, a little bawdy and deeply intriguing .  A must for film buffs.
B000002L7R|3.0|On the upside, it sounds a little different from \\"[[ASIN:B000002KY8 1999]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000002L68 Purple Rain]]\\"--most of the time.  The downside is that it sounds like a fatally-flawed remake of Prince's earlier efforts.  Where once he was wild, unpredictable, a visionary, here he sounds like a kid at the end of his rope who can still make some darn good tunes, since most of the songs on the record were better than anything else that was being released at the time, but who doesn't really know much about anything, except for his lover's tambourine (maybe).  I mean, it sounds nice, but even the sound can't transcend hollow psychedelia.  \\"Pop Life\\" has a nice groove, but it sounds more original than it is.  The same could be said for the album.
B000V6Q7MI|5.0|When \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" first hit the shelves, critics were falling over themselves with superlatives. Even Columbia's \\"Artist...Masterpiece?\\" ad campaign was begging the question. Was this the album that would crack the new wave stereotype that had been hung around Elvis Costello's neck since \\"My Aim Is True?\\"<br />The answer was yes...and no.<br /><br />Granted, hiring Geoff Emerick to put his Beatle-esque touches made for a handsome, rich sound, more than any other album in EC's discography. The expansiveness paid off right from the album's opener, \\"Beyond Belief.\\" Toying with his own range and the overlapping vocal parts, Elvis' willingness to experiment rocked the foundations of all the early \\"punks\\" of the period. (Think of how closely Joe Jackson's \\"Night And Day\\" and The Police's \\"Synchronicity\\" followed.) The experiments were also inherent to the arrangements. The high pitched strings that slip out of the album's fade to \\"Town Cryer\\" were four cellos overdubbed to sound like an entire string section, as I recall.<br /><br />Working from the pretext that they could experiment like the Beatles did, each song was tinkered and toyed with till (as you can hear in the comparisons to the bonus disc's demo versions) they barely resembled their original ideas. It made the original album's side one a song suite of near \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" proportions, with the standout of \\"Man Out Of Time\\" marking the perfect bridge between the Elvis of old and the Elvis of new. His anguished howl that breaks the song open and then ushers it into the heartbreak of \\"Almost Blue\\" reset the boundaries of compositions in 1982.<br /><br />Comparisons to Gershwin and Porter were also being tossed around when \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" first came out, one suspects they had more to do with overzealous critics trying to make associations with \\"serious music\\" than to the obvious merits of Elvis' songwriting prowess. The debt to Tin Pan Alley (\\"The Long Honeymoon\\") is truly there. But the lyrical jabs and jibes are still pure Costello, and a line like \\"In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman's shoes\\" would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross. I'd be hard pressed to imagine Cole Porter working up the anger behind \\"Shabby Doll.\\"<br /><br />In short, the dark and introspective \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" was a turning point for Elvis, final proof that he was at the crest of the still expanding wave of British writers that had begun emerging in the early 80's. It was likely the best album of 1982 as well.llo, and a line like \\"In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman's shoes\\" would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  It is definitely a \\"token romantic comedy,\\" but all four of the guys that I watched this with enjoyed it just as much as the girls did.  It has the \\"Love Actually\\" spirit of twists and sub-plots which eventually result in everything slipping into place perfectly.  Because of the clever (and actually wholesome) plot, it's quite impossible to be unhappy after watching it -- it gives hope to even the most love-lost souls.  Enjoy!
B000FPFCJ4|5.0|As someone who purchased this album when it came out years ago, the songs are still fresh.  I put this album up against any R&B artist, neo soul artist, hip hop artist, anyone.  This album is the bomb with a capital B.
B0024SQW2Q|4.0|&#34;Underworld: Rise of the Lycans&#34; was a pretty good movie. Despite lacking in plot, it had excellent direction and amazing scenes. It was an action packed movie from beginning to end and this is what made the movie so good.<br /><br />This is a prequel to the Underworld movies and tells the story of the enslavement and revolution of the Lycans, led Lucian, and his love affair with Sonja, Viktor's daughter. The movie did not really add much to the Underworld story, only visualize the story of Lucian.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the scenes were amazingly shot; the dark hue of the movie is what makes it so alluring and raw. The camera work is excellent and the direction was precise. The performances were pretty good as well. The movie was very entertaining and left me wanting for another.
B000E97HIA|5.0|In the iconic entertainment career of Prince, this album produced a first for him; never before had a release debuted at #1, which is where this March 2006 quickly found itself on the Billboard 200 chart.<br /><br />Distributed through Universal Records, the 12 tracks clock in at 53:42, but there was drama surrounding the album; the title may be referring to a dispute between Prince and the landlord of his rented mansion in Los Angeles, NBA player Carlos Boozer, as the tenant would incorrectly identify the location by that \\"address.\\"<br /><br />Two singles were released before the album - Te Amo Corazon, December, 13, 2005; Black Sweat, February 2 - but the standout cut is Fury, a Jimi Hendrix-inspired throwback to the psychedelic rock scene of the 1960s, which was released as a single in the UK.<br /><br />The sound leans heavily into the style of R&B/funk/rock that Prince revolutionized some 20 years back, but  the material is fresh and dynamic. The artist is letting the music do all the talking.

B00006LPER|1.0|I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money.  If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend \\"The Piano\\".<br /><br />This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless.  There was no real good story behind the movie.  Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away.  I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.  You'll save time and money.  Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars.

Even though some may call it a chick flick, I know plenty of guys who will admit to really liking it too.

Yes it is but but with hauntingly catchy melodies and some great dark lyrics this album breaks new ground.  Definitely not a typical Nighwish or TOT clone.

0440244870|1.0|I read Remember Me? (Kinsella's latest novel) a while back when it first came out.  This is the book that introduced me to the genre of chick lit, and I greatly enjoyed it.  Perhaps Lexi Smart wasn't the deepest of characters, but the majority of the book was an unfolding of her discovering what it is she really wants out of life, mixed in with some very original humor to keep the pace going.    Confessions of a Shopaholic is NOTHING like that.  I admit I never finished the novel because after reading a particularly despicable act on the main character's part, I got off the train at Penn station and threw it in the trash.  I have never not finished a book out of sheer disgust ... and interestingly enough, I fell into a deep relaxation afterwards knowing that I would never have to deal with Rebecca Bloomwood's retarded problems ever again.    The whole book reads like one car crash after another.  The main character is obviously mentally unstable and a pathological liar, which I found neither funny nor endearing as the author seemed to have intended.  The typical situation in the book plays out like this:  Rebecca sees store, Rebecca goes in and buys too much, Rebecca berates herself, Rebecca goes into deep played-out delusion about how she'll hit the lottery jackpot, win at the casino, marry rich, etc etc etc ... , Rebecca's bubble bursts by some way too obvious event, Rebecca goes into an internal panic attack of massive proportions, Rebecca conjures up new way to lie to her friends, family, coworkers, and so on, to make herself feel better.  For about a hundred pages in the middle of the book this whole cycle goes from start to end every two paragraphs.  I'm not kidding. I lost count of how many mini-meltdowns our \\"heroine\\" had.  Not to mention that after the first few chapters there's nothing that comes out of this girl's mouth that isn't a lie.  It was the epitome of exhausting and disturbing at the same time ... I got a little more than 2/3rds in before I realized life is too short.    I suppose the first couple of chapters were mildly amusing ... seeing a glimpse of what someone who's in financial trouble goes through.  But the humor stopped after realizing the main character's a pretty horrible person in general.  I reckon I read in other reviews that the story wraps up with her getting her dreams come true, getting a hot rich boyfriend, all for not reason, blah blah blah, no repercussions, blah blah boring!  I won't even go into how laughably bland and alike every single character in this story is.   I just hope that the movie is only loosely based on the novel because the message doesn't need to be going out to the masses that it is cute and socially acceptable for young women to be idiots about their finances and unbearably selfish with their loved ones.      The author can do much better than this, so go read Remember Me?; an immensely more well-written story with a better plot line to boot than this garbage.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|No, this is not \\"Heat Part 2\\", but it's not bad. Deniro and Pacino are really good actors and work together well, once again. There's a decent amount of action and intrigue but not enough for five stars. Because it was kept to a respectable time, given the material, I'm tempted to give it five stars -- there are too many three star movies that would drag on another 20 to 30 minutes just to meet a two hour \\"standard\\". It's good for an evening viewing, especially with busy schedules.
0307269752|4.0|I am not much of a mystery reader but this book was great. The plot was definitely 5 stars, but it got off to a rocky start I thought and could have had less of the details and jumped right into the story line so overall I am giving it 4 stars. I am looking forward to the next book
B000OVLBHG|5.0|100 Snazzes on the 100 point Snazz-o-Scale!    Starship Troopers is a superb movie. The special effects are absolutely stunning and it's almost complete action from start to end.     There's a little social commentary, for the government in charge of earth is tolitarianism I think, with severe limits on freedom. One woman explains she joined the military because she wants a baby, and it's easier to get a license if you're a citizen. A bureaucrat compliments Our Hero for joining the infantry, saying it was the infantry that made him the man he is today - he has no legs.    But the main reason to watch the movie though is its huge fantastic battles, lots of wonderful blood and gore, strange alien bugs, a little bit more blood and gore, phenomenal special effects, some more blood and gore, a body count in the thousands if not the millions, and even more blood and gore. Did I mention the blood and gore? Starship Troopers has been compared favorably to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" in its Hack-Factor, that is it's mind-numbing violence. The humans have machine guns, nukes, and plasma cannons. The bugs too have plasma cannons, a flame thrower that shoots out their noses, but mostly they have sharp pincers. While a human must blow multiple parts off a bug to kill it, splattering everything with orange or green guts and goo, the bug will stab humans through the chest, lop off heads, bite off legs and rip bodies in two. Wowee, what fun!    Huge starships explode, crash into each other, or are torn in two by great plasma bolts, sending corpses tumbling into deep space. A guy gets his brains sucked out. A woman gets her arm burned off, two soldiers are reduced to flames, a soldier gets his brains blown out. Unparalleled violence and mayhem and all good clean fun.    Watch it!

B001HN697C|3.0|Rise of the Lycans is the prehistory of the Underworld series, where the genesis of the vampire/werewolf feud is revealed. This fraught mythology is classic fare with no surprises. Still the gloomy tale provides cheap thrills and lots of action from special-effects-expert-turned-director Tatopolous. The ornate blue and black gleam of the murky Underworld universe is beautifully portrayed.<br /><br />Die-hard Underworld fans beware--the only prominent character from the first two movies of the trilogy is Victor, the patriarch of the vampire clan, played with intensity and stamina by Bill Nighy.<br /><br />Critics are complimenting the performance of Michael Sheen who plays Lucian, the rebel leader of the werewolves and secret lover of Sonja, the unruly vampire princess,played by Rhona Mitra. Sheen's rasputin-esque good looks contrast nicely with Mitra's austere alabaster beauty. These unkempt lovers are the vortex around which this thriller revolves and their chemistry carries the story. Fans of Beckinsale may miss her leather-encased pulchritude but I found Mitra's fiery energy a welcome change that provided a more textured and muscular characterization of a female vampire psyche.<br /><br />In a movie season devoid of good fantasy movies and in particular vampire/werewolf tales, Rise of the Lycans provides a welcome diversion!
0805082662|5.0|Bill Martin's classic remains one of the best books for small children. The rhythm is contagious and the text pattern irresistible. Eric Carle's vivid, bold illustration is the perfect complement to Martin's magical text. The book offers opportunity for teaching color names as well as animal names.<br />While there are several charming sequels, none matches the delight of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? If you could only own ten books, this should be one of them.
B000063UR1|4.0|I first saw \\"Silent Running\\" a little while after watching \\"Soylent Green\\".  I think they are, both, very good movies.      Before writing this review, I quickly went through the other reviews.  Apparintly, if you get the message in the film, then this is a good film.  If you don't get it, the film can be very boring.  I am not an environmentalist, but have seen how folks develop the best farm land into housing tracts and shopping centers and commercial spaces.      If you have the brains to see that our future could be nicer, if we take better care of how we treat our environment, then there is a fair chance that you will like this movie.  However, there is entertainment and there is propaganda.  Sorry, the reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that there is a lot of propaganda in this film.       I enjoyed this film.  I did get the message.  But, see if you can check this one out of a library and watch it before deciding to purchase it.    It may help this film to see \\"Soylent Green\\" first.    Do NOT be in an analytical mood on the day you watch this film!

B001J1O848|5.0|Don't let the trailers for Taken fool you, this is an awesome action flick.  The trailers might lead you to believe this might be just another corny action movie, but Qui-Gon Jinn kicks so much posterior in this movie that you'll be wishing for a sequel.  Liam Neeson is nearly 60 years old, but he looks at least 20 years younger in this film.  There are at least 5-6 big action scenes, with a lot of hand-to-hand fighting.  And there's none of the shaky-cam footage from Bourne Identity here- it's raw, and it's brutal.     Don't come in here expecting the English Patient.  There is little plot to be developed, few characters to delve into.  In fact, most of the bad guys don't even have names- the lucky ones might have a first name.  They're the most one-dimensional bad guys ever, but it doesn't matter, because they exist to be beaten up by Mr. Neeson.    The US theater release has been cut to a PG-13, whereas the original UK cinema version has been released as the Extended Harder Cut.  Action fan?  The extended harder cut is a much more visceral, and dare I say, more enjoyable, film.
B00133KDM8|5.0|i enjoyed this CD emmensely! although i am not sure which version of \\"poison\\" i enjoy more, the quality Tarja's voice brings to it certain gives it a new spin!
B00006AVRK|5.0|It's entertaining to see Hugh Laurie (House) in his early years as a comic.  The series is full of fun and silly characters. Jeeves is marvelous at rescuing all of them.
B001GSV3EC|4.0|Enjoyable disk however it's very similar to \\"Official Bootleg USA 2006\\". Jeff is stunning (as usual), Tal is awesome and of course Vinnie and Jason are incredible - so it's worth the price. I hope future live recordings are forth coming, perhaps with more variation in the song list... I don't ask for too much huh?
B00008NG5V|4.0|I already own In Between Dreams and love it.  Before buying this album, I read all the reviews and now that I've listened to it, I have to agree with the critical reviews - most of the songs sound very similar to one another as well as to his other works.  But that's what I wanted.  I don't buy Jack Johnson to be wowed by the variety and breadth of his musicianship, I buy it because it's mellow, chill music, perfect for a rainy Sunday morning or an evening stroll.  So if you're looking for that, you'll enjoy this album (though beware, it's running time is pretty short as the songs themselves are oddly short).  If you're looking to be musically challenged and amazed, look elsewhere.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Okay so it's just their songs, but a great story is based on this collection. Sung the way you might sing along. BUY IT!!!
0375826726|3.0|Negatives: Where Roran's role in Eldest was only passably good, his part in Brisingr is laughably unrealistic, lifeless and ill-plotted. Also, the POV feels slightly off balance, with Nasuada and Saphira's POV chapters placed, seemingly, where they would save the most plotting work, rather than where they would be the most meaningful. Most of the side characters in this book also fall short of the previous books' standard(though not all of them), and the new villains are even worse. Nearly everything feels dry and overworked, contrasting the freshness(if not utter originality) in the previous books. The lack of new places and serious new characters is part of this. Also, the explanation for Murtagh and Thorn's enhanced power really comes up lame; it may work in the next book, but it's melodramatic and anticlimactic for now.   In all Brisingr just doesn't have the level of heart and character of the previous two. The good moments in this book do live up to the previous books - there just aren't enough of them.    Pluses: Even though so much of the book feels stale, Eragon still feels like the same person, as do Saphira(except during her POV passages) and Arya. The parts highlighting these characters are the highlights of the book. Brisingr also has a good string of smaller conflicts going on, especially with Eragon trying to get a new sword and the ever-widening number of promises he makes. Overall its very recognizable as part of the same story, while still managing to bring in a few good new things.  Hopefully it's brought in enough mediocre and enough story-setup for the next book to kick a little higher.
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|With a thin story line, a musical has to have lots of great songs.  The musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Lowe, etc. had one great song after another.  That is hardly the case here.  I heard one great song and that is it.  Another problem: the horrible singing of Pierce Brosnan.  The man has no business singing in a musical.  He cannot sing, simple as that.  Meryl Streep can sing but in a very difficult ballad as she is walking to the wedding, she sounds absolutely horrible.  Maybe she lost her voice but whatever, the producers should have done that one over.  The production qualities of the movie were excellent but I would not buy this movie.  Rent it, watch it and forget it.
0723257639|5.0|It may be a cliche to give five stars to a collected edition of the Beatrix Potter tales, but I think this boxed set of the complete Peter Rabbit books is really deserving of every star it gets and more. The Beatrix Potter tales are really a lasting contribution to literature for children, and appeal to children and adults alike. The stories don't really need much praise here (except that I confess to finding Little Pig Robinson a rather dull, waffling book that was written during Potter's later years), but still this boxed set is well worth its price. I know it's a hundred dollars and more expensive than the omnibus edition of the tales, but you can really savour the original format of the books. The stores unfold gracefully and the format is more pleasing to the eye, as it's perhaps more organised than the cumbersome omnibus edition. Of course, the illustrations are so very picture-perfect, and the reproductions make them look more vivid than ever. A minor quibble is about the six extra illustrations in Peter Rabbit, as they have made the story drag a little as compared to the final published version we know now. That said, I enjoy this new set tremendously, as it's well-produced on the whole, with nice paper and a new font that is more pleasing to the eye. And the box is really a nice touch too. So what more needs to be said than invest in a copy of this superb Beatrix Potter presentation box.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I have had this one since it first came out, what a classic. This is the Neil Young I like the best, every song is excellent. All the songs he chose for this show are to me his best at that time, his guitar skills are at there peak on the acoustic. His voice is also strong and clear, I can't get enough of this set. I hope he has more stuff like this to release for us, This is a must have anyway you look at it. If you are a Neil Young fan don't miss this one, plus the sound quality is top notch for the time period.
B00004YA0T|2.0|What a disappointment! The brass section was in these recordings in very bad condition. In that period Jochum recorded Beethoven with the London Symphony and Brahms with the London Philharmonic.I know many readers will blame me but I really think that it would have been much better to record Bruckner with one of these orchestras. This set has many fans between those who have no basis of comparison and praise this cheap but poor issue as a milestone of the discography.  I have to say that to my ears is unbearable to hear Bruckner, who needs an organ-like brass section, played with such a strained brass sound and with so  many grotesque flops (in a studio recording!)  I like Jochum's fervour too, but his intentions where impossible to realize for evident technical limitations. The sound of the trumpets is very strained since the first bars of every symphony. Take the climax of the first movement of the 8th,where the trumpets sound terribly strained and out of tune. The first movement of the 6th where the trumpets are exposed is disastrous,the final bars of the 8th are full of  enthusiasm but the brass are forced to die. The climax of the adagio of the 7th is reached with effort and the sublime following bars close to the coda ,dedicated do Wagner,are again spoiled by clumsy trumpets. Sadly the list of examples would be overlong, everywhere there are trumpets flaws. With adequate trumpets the 5th could have been a magnificent recording,thanks to Jochum's grand and poetical vision(how beautiful are the introduction to the first movement,the development,and the entire second movement! The strings are dreamy).  According to my opinion, the Staatskapelle Dresden gloriously sounding in almost all the romantic repertoire,with  superb strings, sadly had not a brass section in condition to play Bruckner safely at the time of these recordings.  Jochum is very intense,even more than in his first cycle, but the technical problems of the brass  destroy many of the beautiful moments he tried to create, and his demanding crescendos and stringendos are realized with embarassing efforts. The recorded sound is also quite unattractive.  Between the sets of Bruckner symphonies,let alone the legendary 3-9 Celibidache/Emi,I find excellent the 3 cycles recorded by Asahina,an impressive recent issue is with Paternostro(Antes)- despite a few serious orchestral mistakes(but these are live recordings)it is a successful cycle,in opulent sound,with a wonderful 8th- . Chailly's set is also fine, very well played and recorded.The set of the young Haitink for Philips is after around 50 years still highly raccomandable.  But if you are also interested in separate Bruckner cds,there are many successful recordings with Giulini,Wand,Haitink. It is interesting for me to make a comparison with the magnificent recordings of Sinopoli and the same orchestra of Jochum-Emi 20 years later in a much better form and particularly with  Haitink's  majestic 8th Hass ed.- issued in 2009 by Profil- a 2002 live recording,with splendid Dresden brass, sounding as glorious as the strings! The actual condition of Dresden is superb, incomparable with that of the time of Jochum's recording.  Regarding Jochum, run to buy his marvellous live recordings in Japan(Altus): a fantastic long breathed 7th with the Concertgebow and a dramatic 8th with Bamberg,and don't forget the two live 5ths with the Concertgebow!(Philips and Thara)
B00129H7VS|5.0|Own on DVD as well- Bluray version is incredible!  Picture & sound is so clear- such a great series & so well done.

B000VDDWDS|4.0|As an example of the \\"action film\\" genre, this is superb.  However, it does not go very much past that.  The two naval battle scenes between the tall ships in the time of Napoleon and the Regency are certainly realistic, frighteningly so.  If this has ever been done better on film, I'm unaware of it.    The sailing ships look right, complicated and untidy.  The stunts are perfect, dangerous.  The acting is okay so far as the script allows.  But somehow I wanted to know more about the motivation, especially of the English captain, played by Russell Crowe.  He is dogged in his pursuit of the French enemy, exceeding his orders by pursuing the foe vessel around Cape Horn and far up the west coast of South America.  The action starts in medias res, so we did not get to see the beginning of the voyage--or know how long the crew had been together--or what their motives were.  In short, I think the filmaker needed to move a bit closer inside the men.    This is worth seeing for the action and special effects, the same reason the last Titanic film was worth a look.  I suppose the mayhem is enough for many.  I sometimes wish it were for me.
0066620996|5.0|I work for Alltel (soon to be VZW) and this is a book that our executives recommend during leadership training for all of the new managers. One fascinating finding was that the best performing companies had modest CEO's that were not these charismatic leaders in the spotlight, most of them gave a lot of credit to all that helped the company achieve great success. Another interesting finding was that a lot of the top performing companies in this study were not the big names you would expect. This is a must read.
B0017V7GLC|5.0|Ladytron's \\"Witching Hour\\", their previous record, practically shot to the top 5 of my favorite albums ever and I can look back at it now and honestly say there's barely any filler on it. Even co-vocalist Mira Aroyo's 2 tracks have a likable qualit to them and the album had great pop and dance-y tunes one right after the other. Looking at it, I'm also surprised at how immediate it was which is different compared to their latest. \\"Velocifero\\", their fourth, is not as instant but it's also a rewarding record and though it isn't as near flawless as the last one was, this one is definately worth a listen for fans.    Black Cat: Mira wasn't as prominently featured last time so she takes the reins on this one and it's basically her singing almost flatly while co-vocalist Helen Marnie chimes in with a great melody now and then. With bouncy production and a catchy synth line, this isn't as hard rocking as \\"High Rise\\" but still works great. 9/10    Ghosts: Similar to \\"Sugar\\", this first single is meant to hook you in by having a chorus sung fairly often and the \\"there's a ghost in me/who wants to say I'm sorry/doesn't mean I'm sorry\\" line will easily get stuck in your head.  Though not as repetitive as Sugar...at least until the end chorus anyway, the driving bass line and Helen's vocals make this a keeper. 9/10    I'm Not Scared:  One word to describe this track would probably be \\"energetic\\".  The drums and instruments create almost an ideal track for barreling down the highway at top speeds and of course Helen's vocals are always awesome. That guitar solo is pretty ace too, though slightly buried in the mix. 8.5/10    Runaway: Another single and like \\"Ghosts\\" the line is just simply \\"my little runaway\\" however it's used a bit too extensively. While it's ideal for the dance floor where you're not noticing it, the line is repeated a bit too often.  But there is a great beat the percussion adds and despite the gripe, the chorus is catchy indeed. 8/10    Seasons of Illusions:A Mira track and I actually grew to like it after awhile. A strange synth sound kind of dominates the whole thing and Helen adds some lovely background vocals. Only thing about the song is like most Mira songs, the songs don't, shall we say, explode or do something that takes the song from great to flat-out awesome. 7.5/10    Burning Up: Helen's vocals sound strangely echo-y but the track as a whole is like a lot of tracks on the album: very \\"full\\" sounding with big percussion but it's such a lively and catchy track that it becomes a highlight. Kind of lurches at the end though. 7/10    Kletva: A Mira track and it's another oddity, one of those tracks where it's hard to latch onto though musically it's nicely varied with so much going on at once, \\"wall of sound\\" doesn't quite cut it. Only thing that knocks it is that there's no real vocal melody or really anything to hook into. 6/10    They Gave You a Heart, They Gave You a Name: Very punchy and lively track and the interplay between Mira and Helen works quite well whereas in most songs they either sing solo or just do the occasional background vocal like Black Cat. The \\"lay down beside me\\" is a good hook to get stuck in your head. 8/10    Predict the Day: I don't really know what to think of this one. It starts with very loud percussion and a whistling tune almost straight out of a Sergio Leone film. It's a nice change of pace from the hyper energy tracks but it's maybe a bit...too strange for some. At least this one adds a new whistle for you when you're out walking. 6.5/10    The Lovers:  Propulsive is the word here as it's almost relentless and Helen's vocals are quite good though at times she's a bit buried and makes her hard to understand but then again, most of the tracks have that. Only thing about the track is that it's fairly short so it's hard to say whether it ends too early or it's the perfect length. 7/10    Deep Blue: Mira returns with her usual flat singing which of course works very well. I actuallyquite enjoyed the track and while the \\"deep blue I want to give it all to you, deep blue I know it scares you\\" hook is repeated a fair bit, the track is pretty sweet but then it hits a whole other stratosphere when Helen's vocals come in. Stellar moment when done live. My complaint? She comes in at the last literal minute. Bah. 9/10    Tomorrow: Helen's vocals have a nice dreamy quality during the chorus which almost makes me think of \\"Whitelightgenerator\\" from last record though the track's a bit more energetic and has a nice dream-pop quality to it. Hm, that song was also 2nd-to-last track too and this one is as well. Anyway it's a track well worth a checking out. 8.5/10    Versus: Instead of the quiet subdued \\"All the Way\\", we have a near-epic. It's a bit long (few hairs short of 6 minutes) but the sound of it just gives it a very rich and full experience and makes for a big fat finale. Only strange thing is there's a male background singer with her which is a nice idea but I don't like how their voices sound together. The vocalist of Stars for example (Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan) sound perfect together. Helen and Daniel Hunt don't all that well. Still nice closer though. 8/10    Only thing that knocks Velocifero down from Witching Hour is diversity in that tracks on this one are either high energy or just odd and something like a Beauty #2 or a fun ditty like The Last One Standing would've given this a nice mixture but as it is, this is a great release and well worth the time.

B001IQ5MNK|3.0|This book is written from the perspective of a barely educated man who has grown up in the poor section of India which he calls The Darkness. He was forced out of school and sent to work in the city aka The Light where he manages to convince a rich family of hiring him as a servant. The story begins with him telling his tale after he has risen to heights he never thought imaginable and is now a business owner.<br />The book tells the tale of his struggle and gives insights and philosophical observations about Indian politics and the corruption surrounding it, as seen through a poor man's eyes. All in all a good story that boasts a simplistic writing style and witty comments. Not the best i have read but definitely a good, light read.
B001GQSY64|4.0|This is a good movie, although not a great one. the Fact that it is geared to kids instead of adults makes some things a bit awkward for the serious SW fan.

The Animation is Top Notch and the Audio too.
B001AV411W|5.0|PRIDE AND PREJUDICE was the first book I downloaded onto my Kindle.  How is it possible that this adorable, timeless love story is now almost 200 years old?  I read this book while in high school and could not admit to anyone how much I loved it.  There weren't a lot of Jane Austen book clubs for high school boys back then and white-bread suburbia did not lend itself to those types of disclosures.  However, reading it and EMMA and JANE EYRE and Dickens spoiled me forever for good storytelling.  To this day, I am drawn to novels of eternal themes: love, sex, family and friends.  I don't mean to trivialize Jane Austen with my pithy Candace Bushnell nod, but Pride and Prejudice has all of the intrigue and sex and love of Sex and the City--we just can't see it.  And, let's face it--Big is Darcy. . .200 years later. . .\\"abso--f'in--lutely.\\"

As soon as I knew that the DVD was available I got a copy rushed over to the UK and it was well worth it.  The feature is fabulous, so amusing but also emotional and dramatic.  The DVD extras are great and once you watch them you want to go back and play the feature again.  The sing-along commentary is inspired.  Amazingly perfect casting and a dedicated crew all come together make this a treasure.
1596434252|4.0|My friends joked with me that \\"What, don't you know your alphabet?\\" Of course I do. But you don't get this book to learn your ABCs. You get this book to appreciate your ABCs. Each letter is well designed and carefully constructed. I love seeing the letters literally jump up from the pages and I find it witty how the designers played with the relationship between neighboring letters like \\"i\\" and \\"j\\" and \\"O\\", \\"P\\", \\"Q\\" and \\"R\\". Additionally, the mix of capitals with lowercase is both whimsical and endearing.    As a designer I find this book to be a welcome addition to the many other design and art related books on my shelf. I've enjoyed grabbing the book now and then since I received it and just flipping through the pages. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in nicely designed and well crafted things.
B00009RGBS|5.0|This movie is really great! Renee Zellwegger and Catherine Zeta Jones are superb. It has become one of my favorites. Buying movies through Amazon is easy too. Get what I need and have it delivered quickly...no hassles at the department stores.
B000P12LWY|1.0|The final episode which is detailed in a synopsis within the disk cover is not included on the disks I received. Very disappointed.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|The Caught In The Act CD/DVD was even better than I anticipated! Excellent! The DVD is a live show experience. Well produced, great sound...you won't be disappointed.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This latest edition of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is MUCH better than the older one released several years ago. I did an A & B comparrison & the difference is very obvious. Bright beautiful colors & superb sound make this \\"Platinum Edition\\" well worth getting - Although the Disney organization keeps coming out with \\"improved\\" versions of releases that seem to me to be \\"milking\\" every penny out of every release every few years.
0312383320|4.0|Finally Stephanie Plum is back with the humor, quirkiness and fun we expected  to find in the numbers book. I enjoyed this book, spooky is not a good description of this book - story is far from being spooky or eerie, It is quirky,funny and enjoyable. It brought back Stephanie Plum bumbling through her job and juggling her three men. Evanovich should have brought back more of Grandma and her antics but overall the book was good. Hopefully, Ms. Evanovich will continue with this Stephanie Plum in the numbers books. A great improvement from number fourteen.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|Hitchcock and Grant in one of the great suspense movies of all time.  Has 2 of the most famous scenes in movie history and is a must-see for any movie buff.  Ideally, this movie is seen on the big screen, but not really practical for most of us.  Absolutely recommended....
0671027344|5.0|I found this book very interesting. It made me think a lot about myself, how I view others, and how I view my past high school experience. It taught me to not always think about other people and think about yourself sometimes. Only when you are happy with yourself in life and have some direction can you help others to become happy and guide them in life. I found the main character of Charlie very fascinating and I wish I could feel \\"infinite\\" more often.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Highly recommend, very well made documentary and great educational tool for everyone in the family.
0312427573|4.0|It's obvious that this book takes place in the 80's. What with the 80's wall street narcissism, the abundance of shoulder pads, the European opulence in decorating styles of the elite, the computer screens with \\"green\\" writing, the use of pay phones, the idea that brown lipstick could ever be remotely sexy. Yet despite all this, the book still feels incredibly relevant in today's times. Actually even more relevant as America wakes up to a crisis of confidence in Wall Street.     Almost all characters in this book are contemptible, save for maybe the Lamb kid (although even his wholesome personae is overblown), the little daughter, and the defense lawyer. Yet none of these people are the stars of the book. The real players: Sherman, Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow are incredibly smarmy in their respective fields. You can't root for any of them. Did you want Sherman to win his case or not? Wolfe clearly had a real disdain for these characters and so too did I. But I kind of liked this. I couldn't root for anyone and it kept me on my literary toes.     The only observation that kept running through my head while reading this book was that Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow all had to metaphorically or actually tear down alpha male Sherman in order to feel better about themselves. To that end, I think this book is just as much about American male egotism as it is about anything else.     All in all, a great, worthwhile read (and BTW, the first Wolfe I have ever read; I might have to venture further into his collection).
B000U1ZV8K|1.0|This film set as far as content is phenomenal, But this is NOT the way to purchase films. The 2 disc double side sets, in my experience, tend to have defective viewing. I have bot purchased and sold(I work in retail) sets like this in the past and would say 4/5 have either been trashed/replaced or returned for defects.. Trust me, purchase the box-set or research and buy individually, they are generally $5 to $7 each, come with extras and are a better all-around value even though the price is slightly higher. I just replaced this with the box set myself, and paid roughly five buck more.  Man, I wish movie companies would stop producing sets this way, it's just a lot of agreviation.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Frantic and pitiless, profane yet eloquent, flush with the ability to create laughter out of unspeakable situations, Slumdog Millionaire takes its simple message--what doesn't kill you yields the most lasting education--and weaves a riveting masterpiece about the life of a boy who makes it in a world of delicious contradictions.<br /><br />This is trademark Danny Boyle stuff (of \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"The Beach\\" fame). His stunners have left no doubt that he can poke into a subculture and emerge with a fresh new look at it. But Slumdog goes one better. It is pitch-perfect in its take, but also perhaps his most accessible endeavor thus far.<br /><br />The narrative couches a crisp homage to Bollywood. Funky A.R.Rehman music. A largely Indian crew. Crisp acting, even from kids, in fact especially from kids. And then the gloriously larger-than-life thematic flourishes: poor folks at the behest of a cruel world, friend pitted against friend, brother against brother--and the most tried and tested one of all-- a rags to riches cavalcade of an underprivileged hero who makes it amid impossible odds. It's hero-giri alright.<br /><br />But where it departs from Bollywood is Simon Beaufoy's screenplay. It's dazzling. Professional Indian reviewers have been overly delicate in their reference to Vikas Swarup's novel that inspired the film, \\"Q & A\\". The book was an enjoyable read, but the film merely borrows the central premise and that's basically it. There is a scene towards the end with our two protagonists at a train station where a trick of reverse cutting will tell a discerning viewer just how innovative the thinking behind the screenplay truly is--that is such a sweet, affectionate shot that it moistened my eyes.<br /><br />It's a bummer that such fuss and to-do has been made about how this film projects an unfair image of the country. Guess the confusion arises when established reviewers such as Roger Ebert decide to call it a testament to \\"the real India\\". I wouldn't be so pedantic. To me, the film carries no such delusions of grand purpose. It's a gleeful entertainer. A breakneck story of one individual from *one* aspect of an astonishingly multifaceted country. To that extent, it covers its subject with addicting vigor and focus. It's witty, gritty, and--for suitable values thereof--sh*tty.<br /><br />To address some petty cavils:<br /><br />(1) The use of English by the characters. It's a British production, what did you expect. There's a world outside a specific country. We call it \\"International Cinema\\". Bet there will be local dubbed versions for those who truly desire it that way (now that the film's multitude of nominations have drawn it far away from a SlumUnderdog status).<br /><br />(2) The disrespectful use of the word \\"dog\\" in the title. This smacks of nothing but ignorance of colloquialisms. \\"Word up, dawg\\", for instance? People forget that an insult becomes an insult only when we choose to let it become one.<br /><br />(3) Finally, the unfairness of how it depicts India in a manner that might give people the WrongIdea. To these Einsteins may I point out that the baffling kaleidoscope we call India makes it pretty hard to ever get the RightIdea to begin with?<br /><br />What level of dimness would make a viewer go seeking a wholesome view of a country in *one* film? Just because \\"The Godfather\\" showed with such pizzazz one specific aspect of the American underworld, should we infer that every American is a gun-slinging gangster? \\"Crouching Tiger..\\" may have sketched a mellifluous perspective of China, but I don't recall anyone thinking that our Chinese colleagues fly from tree to tree on their way to work. And so on.<br /><br />It's a movie, not a national treatise. Sure, it depicts poverty. So? Those who have expanded their horizons beyond Spiderman Part 38 will know that countless movies have been made in the last decade alone that depict hard times in *every* country. At any rate, reality is nothing but a collectively accepted notion. I'd say Slumdog is as equidistant from reality as, say, Bollywood's gigantic palaces (yeah, we live that way) or the scantily-clad \\"item girls\\" gyrating on snow-capped mountains.<br /><br />To people who have yet to see this upbeat thriller: ignore all the Pavlovian drivel. It's a delectable film, brimming with fun and suspense, and it has its moral spine exactly where it belongs. With one sweeping flourish it will break your heart, then heal it, then send you packing with music. Literally.<br /><br />Don't miss it.y accepted notion.

B001GCUNVW|5.0|This movie really hit home.<br />Rourke, Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood were perfect!<br />as if the roles were written for them.<br /><br />The Highs and Lows of wrestlers' lives shot documentary style.<br />It really feels, looks and sounds like the real thing.<br />even that is not telling you what the movie is like.<br />Every second is beautiful and powerful.<br />Just all around top notch.<br /><br />Most of the movie was shot here in NJ and I knew most of the locations.<br />and I grew up watching Hogan & Iron Sheik and well,<br />you walk out of the theater with a new respect for all wrestlers<br />and for life.<br /><br />THIS IS A FIRST DAY BLURAY BUY FOR ME FROM AMAZON.COM
B001GCUNVW|4.0|Mickey Rourke stars as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a wrestler who hit his prime 20 years ago and now appears in fights held in school gymnasiums (whenever he has time off from working behind the deli counter at a grocery store). A heart attack forces Randy to retire from wrestling, and he realizes that he has nothing else of value in his life. He attempts to reconnect with his grown daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), who wants nothing to do with him, and also tries to establish some sort of relationship with Pam (Marisa Tomei), his favorite stripper/confidant. When nothing seems to go his way, Randy decides to ignore his doctor's warnings and return to the ring, which is the only place he's ever really belonged.<br /><br />\\"The Wrestler\\" is very well-done and boasts outstanding performances from Rourke and Tomei. However, I cannot honestly say that I enjoyed the film, because it is seriously one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. It revolves around a man's complete waste of his life. Very, very sad. Still, it's a good film, and Rourke is worthy of his Oscar nomination.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|Being male and straight, I was surprised that I actually liked the movie.  Not many special effects and no action scenes (well, OK, lots of action, just not the shoot 'em up kind).  It was kind of fun to watch, and the women looked great on Blu-Ray.  Although, I think Mr. Big should have high-tailed it out of there...
B000UJ48VI|4.0|The Bottom Line:    As long as you don't go into Lolita expecting to see Nabakov's novel put literally on screen, you'll probably be impressed by this fine (if a tad long) adaptation; the acting is top-notch, the B/W cinematography very effective and the conclusion surprisingly poignant
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Unfortunately, when you try to relive the past you find its is just that. THE PAST. Metallica  has had their time in the sun and the desire to suceed that motivated them in their youth is not there. So this CD is a reflection of that.
B000ZM1MG4|3.0|The Bottom Line:    At 116 minutes Tootsie is simply too long to support its one gag; while the movie offers its share of amusing moments, it eventually wears out its welcome and emerges as a fairly forgettable (albeit Best Picture nominated) film.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|It stuck real close to the novel. Acting was wonderful, and it's a western! I can't relate to the bad reviews it has gotten here. It's like I watched a differant film. Being a history buff I really enjoyed the Classic Duelers stance that Hitch went into at one point in the movie during a showdown. Just like something from a Remington or Russell painting. A pretty cool movie that any fan of horse operas would enjoy.  Great costumes and movie sets. If it was sepia toned you would think you were watching something from circa 1900.  Good stuff.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Little Miss Sunshine suprised me as much as anyone by charming its way to an undeserved Best Picture nomination, but it's still a funny and fast-moving road comedy with its share of affecting moments and quotable lines.

6305972591|1.0|The Bottom Line:    While most terrible horror films are \\"distinguished\\" by their bad acting, terrible effects, and low production values, Children of the Corn manages to be all three of those things AND really slow and boring--please look elsewhere instead of wasting 90 minutes or so of your life.
0066620996|1.0|looking at circuit city, fannie mae and most of his case studies makes this by far the worst best seller in the world today.<br /><br />case studies aside, there's too much generalization and awful statistical representation. for example, einstein was called a hedgehog thinker. haha<br /><br />it's a poor book, little substance, good title and great marketing buzz.
B00004XPPE|5.0|The Bottom Line:    Forgotten in the light of Dr. Strangelove but almost as good a movie, Fail-Safe not only convinces utterly in its depiction of accidental nuclear war, but leaves some unforgettable scenes and images in its wake; a great film regardless of how it's remembered today, Fail-Safe will be with me for a long time.

0792846443|4.0|The Bottom Line:    One of the better Steven King adaptations, Misery would probably have been better served by cutting out the snooping-cop subplot and focusing on the claustrophobia of Annie Wilkes' house, but it's still a compelling horror film the way it is.
0439023483|5.0|This is the Twilight series for the post apocalyptic world!  I loved this as much as I did the Twilight series.    A young girl is living her life the best way she knows how.   She has figured out how to put food on the table use the resources of  her community which is called District Twelve It's all she has ever known. She does what she has to do to survive. The story is all from her point of view and perspective of this world. She describes the community and culture in such a believable way that you can imagine being there. She creates stories and strategizes on what it might be like for the others in her community and later uses that skill to help her to compete in the Hunger Games.     Her world is filled with the normal young adult concerns and struggles and then her life is suddenly changed when she becomes a competitor for District Twelve to the Hunger games. The competitors are called Tributes. One boy and one girl tribute from each of the twelve districts is selected to play this yearly game. It's fascinating to see this world that sort of resembles today and how it has changed and morphed into something else. People and their behavior are transcendent regardless of their environment. The Hunger Game does a great job of playing out human behavior using various characters and their reaction to staged and non-staged scenarios. I strongly recommend this novel.
B0006GAO5Y|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A movie whose luster has been unfairly tarnished by its ever-swelling franchise and star, Rocky manages to transcend its somewhat formulaic plot and turn into a truly inspirational (read: not Disney-fied) movie about a man who **SPOILER** loses the big fight but wins a life for himself.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|I bought Homework back in the 90's when Daft Punk released Da Funk and thought it was OK.  Two or three great songs, the rest was background music.  I bought Discovery as well and it didn't do a lot for me.  I let the next album go through to the keeper.      But a friend lent me this album two days ago and I think I'm on my fifth listen already.  Fantastic live album, as the other reviewers mention, they really do capture the energy of a concert.  The \\"it\\" moment for me on this album is about 3:40 into Touch it / technologic when the beat kicks in.      If you've ever found yourself bopping along to \\"Da Funk\\" or \\"One More Time\\", you'll love this album.
B00000JRTX|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Four Weddings and a Funeral is marred slightly by the presence of Andie McDowell, who may give viewers the impression that Hugh Grant ends up with the wrong woman; aside from that blip, however, the film is a completely successful merger of romance, comedy, and pathos.
B001NK4JJ4|5.0|I really liked this book.  Usually don't read a book cover to cover in a matter of days, but this was laid out really nicely for that - story went along coherently - the implications of the story and the depth of meaning of the whole experience these two people had with each other and their lives separately from each other really left me wondering about things.  The book did not answer all the questions and I was glad of that - I'm still thinking about it and looking forward to seeing the movie.
1582701709|1.0|Well I began to read it.  I applied all the ideas around the Law of Attraction with no success.  Although I have not had any luck what so and I am back to old miseries.    -I had a terrible review last week.  -I had a returned check yesterday because my direct deposit at work had an error.  -I just found out that I will need to quit my job do to a ride issue.  I have a mountain of debt.    I have written down a list of the possibilities surrounding these negatives.  Perhaps it will help.  But for now I'm just so depressed and I dont know what to do.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|I just saw this movie for the first time on one of the movie channels and the best word to describe it is ... delightful.  I would have no problem whatever in allowing young children to watch the movie.  How very refreshing to see a movie with no voilence, profanity or sex!  I will purchase the DVD to add to my collection.  I encourage all to see it!
B000670DQI|4.0|Reality being Bowie's 2003 release was very well received both by critics and fans alike. On this release we songs that deal we Bowie reflecting on the fact that he is now an old person in songs like \\"The loneliest guy\\", \\"Days\\" and \\"Never get old\\". The booklet is a strange little story we the cover being a anime picture of Bowie. The font is atrocious and makes it very hard to read the information. We get a nice list of whom and what they played on the album. The lyrics are very difficult to read. 4/5.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|In my opion Trowers best alblum. Speaks of life on many levels, musically and lyrically. If only classic rock radio shared my opion. Thanks for the web site.
B000I0QL82|4.0|[[ASIN:B000I0QL82 Holiday Inn (Special Edition)]]It's a wonderful movie with a lot of great songs.  But, if it was remastered, I couldn't tell. It was a little fuzzy.

B0010V4TZU|5.0|I got Vampire Weekend as a Christmas present from my wife, per the recommendation of my 14-year-old son, and I absolutely love it.  The lyrics are witty, and the rhythms are catchy.  I especially like the reggae/ska/African elements that are scattered throughout the disc and are especially prominent on the songs Oxford Comma (my personal favorite), A-Punk, and Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa.  On top of that, the band is able to masterfully weave the use of classical instruments like harpsichord, cello, violin, and viola into these very modern pop songs, which gives them a very fresh and unique sound.  Even so, as other reviewers have noted, there obviously are a number of musical influences at work here, including Paul Simon's Graceland CD, the English Beat, and the Talking Heads.  More than anyone else, however, I frequently found myself being reminded of the Police--which is not a bad thing.  Very highly recommended
0321543726|5.0|I'm an \\"advanced beginner\\" (and a self-learner and English is not my first language).     By \\"advanced beginner\\" I mean I've read 4 beginner's books, so I'm at last almost comfortable with elementary things such as function, class, object, loop, nested loops, pointer, recursion, libraries, etc. (By almost comfortable I mean I'm not afraid any more)     I would not recommend this book to a total beginner, at least not to the below average beginner I was, because he probably would have been left mystified or bewildered by this book. But I would definitely recommend it to an \\"advanced beginner\\" or a gifted beginner or a beginner who have access to some kind of teacher or mentor.    I like books that are clear, concise, accurate, technical, and especially who aren't afraid to introduce what may seems to be complex subject (because if it is done step by step and clearly the complexity fades away). This book meets all these requirements. I mean one of the first program is a parser, a PARSER! what a wonderful thing to learn at the beginning of your programming career. You learn about grammar and parsing and stream before page 200 (I'm actually at the beginning of chapter 7, that is page 219)    Wonderful book, thank you Professor Stroustrup.
B001N26GFC|5.0|The main character of this Brit movie is a 30 y old teacher, who is infected by overwhelming good humor and cheerfulness. She bubbles away with jokes and giggles in the tryingest situations. Say, she comes out of Camden Market and finds her bicycle stolen. Most people would burst out into the darkest curses. Not Poppy. She shrugs, regrets that she couldn't even say goodbye to the thing, walks home, and decides to learn driving a car. Which leads to some dark encounters with a manic driving instructor. These are the tuffest moments in a mostly sunny story. Maybe I should also mention her otherworldly dialogue with the deranged homeless man.<br /><br />Apart from her jolly good humor, which can be hard to swallow for some (including some reviewers), she is a genius in empathy. Nobody could be better suited for a teaching job.<br />I had to make up my mind whether I love her or loath her. My daughter instructed me to love her. Ok, I loved her.<br />The nice little movie even has a hint of an happy end, when she finally meets a nice guy and it seems to start well. Good for her. (I am not categorically saying that finding a man is what 30 y old single female teachers need most in life. I am just reporting her own feeling about it. 'Where have all the good men gone?', she had previously said to her flatmate.)

0316017922|5.0|In the blogging circles I follow, it's been nearly impossible to miss the frequent mentions of the book Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell.  I requested a review copy of the book, as I'm not sure I'd get through our library hold list for the next six months given the popularity of the book.  I'm glad I made the effort to get a copy, as Outliers does an excellent job in destroying the common myths of what it takes to be successful.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Introduction - The Roseto Mystery<br />Part 1 - Opportunity: The Matthew Effect; The 10000-Hour Rule; The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 1; The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 2; The Three Lessons of Joe Flom<br />Part 2 - Legacy: Harlan, Kentucky; The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes; Rice Paddies and Math Tests; Marita's Bargain; A Jamaican Story<br />Notes; Acknowledgments; Index<br /><br />The first example of \\"success\\" involves a sport I know and love...  junior hockey.  It's generally thought that at the Junior A level (just short of professional), the stars are ones that have worked harder and have more skills than others who haven't made it to this level.  But after looking at player statistics, Gladwell noticed something interesting.  Nearly all the players have birthdays in the January/February range.  Coincidence?  Not really...  It turns out that January is the age cutoff for players.  Players born in January are the oldest of their class year.  They are bigger than other kids in the same year.  At the age of five, those five to eight months of difference creates a significant edge.  The January players get noticed, and get more attention than others.  This attention leads to more opportunities, which makes them better, which gives them more opportunities, etc.  The kids born towards the end of the class year don't end up with the same advantages as they're smaller.  The net result is that these Junior A stars may think that they've achieved this level through pure skill, but the real answer is that they've achieved quite a lot simply by being born in January...<br /><br />Gladwell uses this insight to dig into other success stories and general assumptions (such as all Asians being good at math).  In all the cases, he found solid evidence to point to other external factors that gave these people and groups an edge beyond \\"hard work\\".  The Asian/math phenomenon can be tied back to language that enables young children to understand math concepts much more easily than does English.  Korea Air plane crashes were not due to Koreans being bad pilots.  It was tied to a culture of deference that kept crew members from openly questioning the captain, thereby forcing communication to follow a ritualized pattern to avoid offense.  Once you're made aware that the \\"lone wolf\\" pattern is rarely a complete story, Gladwell's findings cause a lot of things to fall into place when it comes to achievement.  Basically, you are who you are because of those who came before you.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  I've often thought there had to be more behind the \\"self-made man\\" stories, and Gladwell confirms it.  That's not to say that someone can't overcome the odds, that they can't be born in December and become a hockey all-star.  But it forces you to look behind the obvious feel-good stories to find other answers.  Even if you don't agree with the conclusions that Gladwell reaches, you'll be forced to think.

B0006U4UAU|4.0|LCD Soundsystem is a very good CD that incorporates a nice mixture of guitars and synth beats along with some cool vocals.  I'm not sure how to label the music, but I've noticed several reviewers describe it as \\"Discopunk,\\" which works for me.  A couple of the songs probably would have benefitted from having been edited a little, but that is not a big problem.  I think that I prefer the second disc, which apparently contains the \\"older\\" songs that initially developed a following for LCD Soundsystem, but I've changed my mind about that several times already, which means that I think that they both are good.   As other reviewers have noted, LCD Soundsystem also a great bargain, with two discs for the price of one.  Highly recommended.

0312427646|5.0|I received this book as a surprise gift from a good friend who loves reading as much as I do. I had never heard of this novella and only peripherally knew of Alan Bennett from enjoying the filmed version of his play _The Madness of King George III_. I didn't know what to expect, as this book is quite different from the others I've been reading lately, though my friend spoke highly of it. Now I understand why and agree entirely. This novella, though only 120 pages long, sweeps you into a fascinating and humorous journey through the halls of Buckingham Palace and beyond as you follow the Queen of England in her discovery of the pleasures and perils of reading.<br /><br />In the course of the novella, the Queen follows her dogs, of all creatures, into a nearby library and down the rabbit-hole into a pursuit that remakes her life with unusual and unexpected consequences. The more the Queen reads, the more her perspective on the world around her changes, and the more her staff tries to undermine these changes they believe reading has wrought upon their monarch. Alan Bennett perfectly captures the aristocratic voice of the Queen and her coterie while maintaining a wickedly amusing tone throughout, as well as delivering a surprise ending that is both completely unexpected and perfect. The characters are neatly portrayed; you'll find the heroes sympathetic and the villains scandalous, in a very upper-class British way. A wonderful diversion for a quiet afternoon, best accompanied with a steaming pot of tea.
B00005MCX2|4.0|Have you ever wondered what inspired Japan's Boredoms to shift abruptly from the frustrating, one-and-a-half-minute blasts of noise that characterized their early work, to the 10-minute-long psychedelic excursions that started around the time of the \\"Super Are\\" album?     I have. And I think I found the answer -- Space Ritual.     If you have any appreciation for that, you should get this record.

B00006JU7T|5.0|I'm of the mind to think that the 70s in American cinema is its golden age. Serpico is an indispensable product of that period, and if you haven't seen this yet, you won't get a chance to find out why Al Pacino is one of our most interesting actors. When the movie makes you want to read the book immediately after viewing, you know you've come across something special.

0307388921|2.0|I just did not get the point of this book?  I could not tell if it was just a weird tale about a guy with all kinds of problems and hang ups, or whether there was some point to it all.  It was entertaining--especially the parts about his escapades--I will give it that, but it  left me wondering what the hell was that I just read. I thought it would come to some sort of conclusion,  but it did not.  If his other books are like this, I don't believe I am going to read them.

0060764899|4.0|The four Pevensie orphans Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are evacuated to the enormous country house of Professor Kirke. When Lucy, during a game of hide and seek, finds a big wardrobe in an empty room, she decides to use it as her hiding place. To her big surprise she notices behind the fur coats at the back of the closet a spot of white snow. The world behind the wardrobe turns out to be the wonderfully strange world of Narnia. At first her friends do not believe what she has discovered, but it won't take long before the others are face to face with the faun, Mr. Tumnus, the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch.<br /><br />The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a real treat for anyone who likes simple, but not less exciting fantasy. The power behind this book is that it brings the story without too much need to moralize. There is certainly some moral lesson behind what is happening, certainly when considering the actions of Edmund, but it never reaches the level of the Victorian Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz. Of course this book dates from the 50's and is written in an era that differs much from Victorian times, still it strongly reverbs the explorative nature of those times. The colorful characters are brought to life in a dreamlike setting that is bursting of opportunities for the six sequels that will follow this book. The humor is omnipresent, but certainly is at its best when the narrator intervenes with his commentary. Again a wink to Victorian novels. If you want to be engulfed in a wonderful and not too complex world, then The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a good start.
B000001FLI|5.0|Handyman been thinking about RB, and that worn LP of \\"Roy Buchanon\\" sitting up in the attic.  I will brag and say I was the first kid on my proverbial block with this album in the stacks.  Caught a mid 70's concert in Boston and wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew it wouldn't be smoke machines, makeup,  spandex.   RB perhaps  the hands-down oddest \\"guitar hero\\" in the annals of blues, rock, country music history.  More of a Guitar Ghost than a Guitar God but little does it matter.  Stick  the same Telecaster, same amp,  in ten  great player's hands and hear ten different approaches, ten different tones. Blindfolded I could pick RB out of the litter,a few bars in.  Roy's approach and tone that of a man possessed.  There's just no way to squeeze much more out of guitar than RB did.  This album is a fine \\"sampler\\" of all that RB could do.

B001HZK8FY|4.0|First off, I'm a 24-year-young male, and I absolutely adore this movie for more reasons than I care to expound on right now. When I heard they were releasing this limited edition set 2 days after my birthday, I knew it was pretty simple to find out what I was gonna get myself this year as a present :). I had this on pre-order for almost 60 days I was so excited to get it! I can probably say I was AS excited, if not more excited, to get this DVD set than when the original came out in 2005. And I'll be honest, I'm almost tempted to go out and buy a Blu-Ray player right now just so I can have it in upscaled 1080i and TRUE 1080p! I know, ridiculous, but like I said, this movie is fantastic, and I'm a true fan through and through.     But this leads me to the biggest reason I'm only giving it 4 stars and not 5 (I could easily give it 5 stars based on being bias, but I'm gonna be truthful). I was really hoping for the two infamous, remaining deleted scenes on this L.E. DVD set (bathtub scene, and kitchen table scene), but they were not on there. In fact, the DVD that comes with this set is an exact replication of the stand-alone DVD that came out 4 years ago. I'm so disappointed that they did not provide ANY additional extras for this movie than what all us fans have already seen. Additional \\"Making Of\\" featurettes would have been nice, maybe some bloopers/gag reels, maybe even an extended version of the filming locations and stuff.    The stuff that did come in it (the spiral-bound picture book, bookmarks, stickers, notecards and envelopes, etc.) are all great, but it would have been great to spruce up the DVD features as well if there's all this focus on \\"Limited Edition.\\" Not disappointed overall, cuz I would be owning it either way it came, I just think it left me surprised they didn't give us die-hard fans anything extra on the actual DVD to watch that we hadn't seen before.    Still a good buy though if you love the movie.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|wall-e the movie it self was amazing but video quality alone is enough reason to buy this movie
B001F7MSFM|5.0|Wow! This movie is truly exceptional. The characters pull directly from the first movie and move nicely along into the second, seamlessly.<br />All is exceptionally well done. The special effects, costumes, sound, music, plot... everything.<br />This would certainly be best in a theater, however I rented and boy was I sorry I didn't go to see it while it was playing.<br />Definitely for adults, language and violence are strong themed here. But if you're an adult who likes strong action/fantasy movies then this is the one for you. Without a doubt, one of my more recent favorites.<br />Rent it.... you won't be sorry.

1932073221|5.0|Sanaya Roman is a great author who channels the wisdom that she is given into easy to understand methods. She speaks to ordinary people in such a way that they can relate these lessons to their everyday life.    She touches upon your belief system,emotions-feelings so you can actually start to see results in your life. I think this book is much more easier to relate to than the \\"The Secret\\" and more substance and less hype. Tells people that you do have to participate in your life. If you sit back and just wait for things to change. It won't happen. Gets rid of the victim mentality. People need to wakeup. You are not a victim. You need to take action to make positive changes in your life.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|There are sounds in there that were always there but that you haven't heard before. The 5.1 mixes open up the sound spectrum so wide you think you are listening to instruments that must have been added for the remastering. Your mind knows you are listening to the same recordings, but the way they sound makes you wonder if they are indeed the original ones. There is more emotion in Peter Gabriel's singing; more bite in Steve Hackett's guitar; more clarity in the acoustic pieces; more presence of the keyboards of Tony Banks; you can finally hear Mike Rutherford's excellent bass guitar and Phil's signature drumming. The extras are great and like a good book, they leave you wishing they wouldn't end and wishing there was more. The only disappointment is that there is no footage to speak of from a \\"Lamb\\" concert. Ah, but you get to finally see what it was like to be at a live concert form the mythical era of Genesis. No more relying on pictures or stories from old; here it is: new, once again, just like the first time, only better.
B001HZK8FO|5.0|I've heard THE NOTEBOOK called many things - a chick flick, over the top tearjerker etc.  Is this the case?  Not to me.  This film is a love story - a story where the love is believable and tugs at your heart realistically.  The basic plot is formulaic - rich girl falls for boy from the wrong sides of the tracks and of course their relationship can't work.  Beyond that premise nothing is formulaic.  In the world today where there is so much strife, death and trouble it becomes magical to view a rare film such as this where love, which is most important in this world, is the main theme and pulsates with a life of its own.<br /><br />I don't want to give away a lot of the plot but it must be said that the film works to the level it does due to the amazing acting and chemistry between Ryan Gosling/Rachel McAdams and Gena Rowlands/James Garner.  They are all superb and put their heart and soul into their roles making the characters totally real.  I have seen this film five times now and each time it tugs at that special place in my heart.  This last viewing was with this item, the blu ray disc and I continue to be amazed at all that blu ray is caable of.  The 1080p high def picture is crystal clear and all emotions expressed become that much more sincere.  The colors are vibrant and some scenes will have you holding your breath in awe.  You can see each piece of hair and lines on the face.  Bottom line, it is like viewing the film for the first time.  The audio is in spectacular dolby truehd 5.1 and the music is glorious with dialogue set to perfection.<br /><br />What you get for the price here is simply amazing.  The blu ray comes in a beautiful keepsake box which contains a lovely 46 page photo album that is half info on the actors in the film and half album for you to put pictures from your own story.  You get decorative stickers and photo corners, 2 themed book marks and a set of 16 lovely notecards and envelopes.  This film is for anyone who believes in love and is not afraid to admit it.  It is not only a chick flic but a film for anyone with a true emotional bone in their body.  It is a timeless film that tells a timeless tale.  I can't say enough about the beauty of this film from its story to the way it is filmed.  And you deserve the glorious experience of viewing it on blu ray.<br /><br />Lastly, I always wonder when I purchase a blu ray film will I want to watch it only once?  Should I have rented it?  This one is definitely a keeper and a must have addition to your collection.  I wanted to view it a second time right after finishing the first viewing.  Valentine's Day is coming up and this is a perfect gift for the love in your life or for anyone who is a romantic and believes in the power and strength of love.  But this film is also a definite year round treasure.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  A beautiful film presented in a beautiful package.admit it.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien series is a series of classic films from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Truly a standard setting series of science-fiction horror films.     The first film was directed by Ridly Scott as a slow-paced, horror suspense film. Even the 1979 theatrical version has plenty of amazing special effects that look good by today's standards. The suspense is fantastic, and the jumps are unforgetable. The Director's Cut has one or two extended scenes, but it's still an insignificant change.     The second film (Aliens) is another great film, but shoots more for an action/adventure type of flick. While I perfer the first one for pure suspense, the second film has amazing characters and amazing action sequences. Definatly a must see.    The third film is a bit underated in my eyes. Hated by critics for the sad opening and ending, the movie is still quite good. I thought that Sigorny Weaver performed her character better than any of the other Alien films. The special effects may lack and the other characters may not be likeable, but the movie was still satisfying. The Theatrical Cut is the one I perfer, since it is shorter. The Special Edition has about 30 minutes of added side-plots.    Alien Ressurection the least of all four films. I didn't like it in the first 15 minutes and didn't like the rest of the movie at all. Very terrible movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                               The special features for every film are excellent. Not only are they very well done, but they are made up of interviews, behind the scenes footage, and screen test; but they are quite compelling and good.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|It's a slinky,seductive album. I love her husky voice,it just draws your attention. Her lyrics are so raw and in your face. She also has a playful side to show that she dosen't take herself too seriously. If your looking for a deep, soulful record with a sense of humor,this is the album for you.
B00005REQR|5.0|Alright, that does it.  Gong is officially the most drugged out band I've ever heard from the 70's.  I have NEVER heard a band who sounds like they are more high and crazy in the head than these guys.  So the question is, can someone like me (who's never done drugs) understand and appreciate music like THIS?      Well I hope so, because these guys are probably my favorite of the progressive rock bands.  You know what?  FORGET about the fact they are a prog band.  These guys are nothing like Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull or anyone else.  This is not even anything like the space rock bands like Pink Floyd, Hawkwind or Rush.      This is just INSANELY musically creative... not rock music necessarily, more like atmospheric circus rock.  There, I think that's the best way to describe this album (and the other three Gong albums I've heard, including the trilogy).      The great thing about Gong is that, it's not COMPLETELY atmosphere.  In other words, every moment of their songs seem to build to something interesting and progress through different themes.  You just need to prepare yourself for some of the most twisted, unpredictable and atmospheric music you've ever heard.
B000000OUE|5.0|This is an awesome record. It's their best record ever, with their horror movie vibe and weird, campy lyrics;you can't help but be enthralled by the genius of Rob Zombie. There's alot of thrash metal and dancey beats. He basically made heavy metal danceable. The sound bites are too funny and just add to the insanity of their evil sounding music. Yes I say evil because being good is just too boring.
B0002O39A2|5.0|I highly recommend this album to all Camel and Caravan fans.    What most impresses me about this Khan album is the way the album sounds.  Just listening to the way it sounds, it's very clean and polished, and it even sounds commercial.  So why wasn't it a commercial success?  I have no idea why.    The instrumental jams closely remind me of what Camel would be doing a few years later such as on the Mirage album, and most of them are quite good and soothing.  Maybe they could stand to be a little more melodic, but that's not much of a complaint really.  The vocal melodies are adventurous in an atmospheric way, similar to Alan Parsons Project or Pink Floyd.  The album is simply a joy to listen to.      If you love 70's music, especially creative bands who keep the atmosphere and melody flowing at the same time (so the music contains an interesting flow the entire time without ever becoming boring) this album is for you.
B000002HJR|5.0|It's a side project of Phil Anselmo. It big deviation from Pantera. It's just a really good Heavy rock album. Lots of crunchy guitar and Phil's screaming vocals but also you get interesting instruments they use;like bongos and cowbell. The songs tends to be moodier, more drawn out. Nice harmonizing and bluesy guitar gives you a real laidback feel on some songs. It's quite a fine album to enjoy over and over again.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|I absolutley love this movie. Tom Hanks is fantastic,his facial expresions and body language change with the moment and situation and just pull you into his character. * You know you would start talking to the ball too !!The way he physically changes is crazy. The wide screen feature of this dvd is what its all about, you are able to capture the entire panoramic view as he (the camera) is panning around the island, it makes it more breath taking and believable of being stranded on this mennacing and beautiful island.  I just love this flick!!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Manson' best album ever! Lots intense, dark lyrics and chainsaw guitars. Manson's haunting vocals on the \\"Man That You Fear\\" will give you chills. It's must have for your music collection.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Terminated II Extreme Edition is an excellent buy.   Despite the fact that I awarded the film 5 stars, the high definition film version can only be seen with  Interactua software - which is NOT compatible with Windows Vista! However, the film in `normal' THX, Dolby Digital 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1 (you get the point) is absolutely mesmerizing itself- just turn up the volume!    The extra feature, `frame-by-frame' behind the scenes explanation subtitles is so thorough that you literarily have to pause the film every 2 seconds, due to the amount of text.  Perhaps it is because I'm not fast reader, but it does become rather tedious to have to pause and rewind so often.     I reckon if the two features (behind-the-scenes subtitles and feature video clips) had been viewable as separate options one would only need concentrate on one feature and enjoy the other on another occasion. Yes, you would have to see the film again - but the film is so good it is worth seeing over and over again.       Other than these minor issues, EXCELLENT!
B001HN6972|4.0|Alright. There were a lot of good movies this year (Dark Knight, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Burn After Reading, Synecdoche New York, Milk, Frost/Nixon, Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Slumdog Millionaire, Revolutionary Road, and, of course, The Reader). But even the cream of the crop films are not perfect and I would venture to say that as good as the crop was this year there really wasn't a five star film among them.<br /><br />Unanswerable Question:<br />The Reader asks a difficult question,\\"when an entire nation seems to have turned a blind eye to the holocaust while it was occurring is it really fair or just to find only a select few individuals responsible and hold only them accountable?\\"<br /><br />Of course The Reader only asks this question, it does not answer this question. And the real interest here is not whether this question can be answered or has an answer, but the way the question is embedded within a love story.<br /><br />The Love Story & Uses of Literature:<br />Both of the main characters enjoy literature but for different reasons. The young student Michael (David Kross) enjoys literature because life is mysterious to him and literature is an avenue toward knowledge and understanding, but Hanna (Kate Winslet) enjoys literature because it offers her an escape from the bleak realities of her past and her present. The summer long love affair that unfolds between the 15 year old Michael and the 36 year old Hanna is therefore doomed from the start: Michael wants to know things but Hanna wants to forget them. Since Hanna is not communicative but secretive, literature is this couple's substitute for conversation. Literature brings them together for that single summer and then later in life, under remarkably different circumstances, it brings them together again. But later in life literature has come to mean something entirely different to each. For the older Hanna literature is a way to live and to feel when all other avenues have been closed to her; and for the older Michael literature has become a way to keep life (namely his conflicted and unresolved feelings for Hanna) at a distance and to live without having to risk or feel anything.<br />The love story is the most moving thing about this film and the most interesting thing is the way the characters are defined by the complex and evolving way each uses literature.<br /><br />Separate Narrative Trajectorys:<br />In the first half of the film the tragic irony is that young Michael is moving toward life while Hanna is moving away from it; and in the second half of the film the tragic irony is that just as the elderly Hanna has finally found a way to move toward life she finds that the person from whom she seeks solace and perhaps a measure of understanding if not forgiveness has long since moved away from life and her.<br /><br />Holocaust:<br />But of course this is not just a love story, but a love story and a Holocaust film. And each narrative complicates the other. In the broadest terms the dysfunctional love story between Hanna and Michael is an effective way of showing how events from the past have ongoing consequences. The most obvious victims of the Holocaust were of course the millions of Jewish men and women and children who perished (as well as those who survived) and no amount of war trials or reparations can diminish or alleviate the suffering that the Holocaust caused and continues to cause. That is a given, however, this film attempts to shed light on the fact that although no other groups suffering can be compared with what the Jewish people suffered, many non-Jewish lives were also ruined as a result of an inability of certain people at certain times and places to think and act for themselves. The film allows us to see that guilt and suffering can take many forms and take many years to work through, and that even many years might not ever be enough. This is not an upbeat love story, in this narrative love does not conquer all.<br /><br />Kate Winslet:<br />Has an actress ever had a better year than Kate Winslet in 2008?  Jessica Lange had a very good 1982 (Frances, Tootsie), thats the only actress I can think of who has had a comparable year.<br /><br />I am not going to choose between her performance in Revolutionary Road and her performance in The Reader because I think they are equally tremendous. What both of these roles have in common is suffering. I don't think any actress has ever brought so much subtlety and nuance and so much heart and soul to that emotion, that state of being. In both roles Winslet plays someone who cannot live with things as they are (or things she has done) and yet feels powerless to do anything to improve her situation. In Revolutionary Road her character, April, is handicapped by being a woman in 1950's America where women's options are severely limited; and in The Reader her character, Hanna, is handicapped by her inability to come to terms with her past, and her inability to read.<br /><br />Illiteracy:<br />As I said at the beginning of this review, even the good films this year are not perfect and I think what mars this otherwise powerful film is the illiteracy issue. The film would be stronger without it. I think the fact that Hanna is illiterate can be read as a cheesy way to make her character seem more like helpless victim than responsible subject. The illiteracy issue does not ruin the film, but it complicates an already complicated film. At times in The Reader I felt that Hanna was more embarrased by the fact that she couldn't read than she was by the war crimes (that she may or may not have committed). I think the illiteracy issue blurs the real issue. The real issue is accountability and the decision to make Hanna illiterate seems to be the kind of writerly decision that only a writer interested in courting Hollywood favor would make. It mars the film because it makes it seem like Hanna is less knowing than the other prison gaurds and less aware of what she may have been guilty of and therefore less culpable than the others who knowingly committed heinous acts. Deciding to make Hanna illiterate seems like a calculated move to win the character and the film attention from a Hollywood voting community that often favors films about people with handicaps. (Yes, the film was based upon a novel written by a German author but even German authors are not immune from marketplace realities.)<br /><br />Everything else about this film is deserving of the praise that it is receiving.<br /><br />One further note: I felt that Lena Olin (an under-employed actress of great talent) did a tremendous job playing a survivor who publishes the Holocaust narrative that is used against Hanna (another use of literature) but can never forget the Holocaust nor forgive those responsible for it. Her character is hard and bitter and understandably so. One wishes there had been more time to explore this character's psychology. But this character's appearance at the end of the story is a smart move. It puts Hanna and Michael's story in perspective and it also shows that this Jewish author accepts that Hanna's story is part of her own. Granted, the Jewish author does not gesture toward reconciliation but simply recognizes that their stories are linked and part of the same narrative, and that is a very magnanimous gesture indeed. And one that Michael must make as well.<br /><br />This was a brilliant move that (somewhat) saves the film from its calculated and transparent and manipulative use of illiteracy.in 2008?  Jessica Lange had a very good 1982 (Frances, Tootsie), thats the only actress I can think of who has had a comparable year.     I am not going to choose between her performance in Revolutionary Road and her performance in The Reader because I think they are equally tremendous. What both of these roles have in common is suffering. I don't think any actress has ever brought so much subtlety and nuance and so much heart and soul to that emotion, that state of being. In both roles Winslet plays someone who cannot live with things as they are (or things she has done) and yet feels powerless to do anything to improve her situation. In Revolutionary Road her character, April, is handicapped by being a woman in 1950's America where women's options are severely limited; and in The Reader her character, Hanna, is handicapped by her inability to come to terms with her past, and her inability to read.     Illiteracy:  As I said at the beginning of this review, even the good films this year are not perfect and I think what mars this otherwise powerful film is the illiteracy issue. The film would be stronger without it. I think the fact that Hanna is illiterate can be read as a cheesy way to make her character seem more like helpless victim than responsible subject. The illiteracy issue does not ruin the film, but it complicates an already complicated film. At times in The Reader I felt that Hanna was more embarrased by the fact that she couldn't read than she was by the war crimes (that she may or may not have committed). I think the illiteracy issue blurs the real issue. The real issue is accountability and the decision to make Hanna illiterate seems to be the kind of writerly decision that only a writer interested in courting Hollywood favor would make. It mars the film because it makes it seem like Hanna is less knowing than the other prison gaurds and less aware of what she may have been guilty of and therefore less culpable than the others who knowingly committedheinous acts. Deciding to make Hanna illiterate seems like a calculated move to win the character and the film attention from a Hollywood voting community that often favors films about people with handicaps. (Yes, the film was based upon a novel written by a German author but even German authors are not immune from marketplace realities.)      Everything else about this film is deserving of the praise that it is receiving.     One further note: I felt that Lena Olin (an under-employed actress of great talent) did a tremendous job playing a survivor who publishes the Holocaust narrative that is used against Hanna (another use of literature) but can never forget the Holocaust nor forgive those responsible for it. Her character is hard and bitter and understandably so. One wishes there had been more time to explore this character's psychology. But this character's appearance at the end of the story is a smart move. It puts Hanna and Michael's story in perspective and it also shows that this Jewish author accepts that Hanna's story is part of her own. Granted, the Jewish author does not gesture toward reconciliation but simply recognizes that their stories are linked and part of the same narrative, and that is a very magnanimous gesture indeed. And one that Michael must make as well.    This was a brilliant move that (somewhat) saves the film from its calculated and transparent and manipulative use of illiteracy.
B0000WN0ZK|2.0|I saw this film when it was released in theaters and its power has stuck with me for over 40 years.  I was thrilled when it found out it had been released on DVD.  Unfortunately, the soundtrack is so awful that it ruines an otherwise brilliant piece of film making.  It is center speaker only and is of very low quality. Perhaps someday it will be re-released with the original soundtrack - in the meantime, save your money.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I heard the hype this summer. I heard the claims that it's not \\"politically correct,\\" whatever that means. So, I decided to get the DVD and watch it. I found portions of it to be the funniest stuff I have ever seen anywhere. The acting was intense. Particulary strong was Robert Downey, Jr. His \\"I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude\\" should be carved in stone somewhere.     Tropic Thunder takes comedy to new and exciting heights (depths?). It's The Three Stooges gone digital, twenty-first century, and into the jungles of Southeast Asia with a multi-million dollar special effects budget. It seems to me that this film is an example of creative/comedic genius gone wild.
B000OLDIM2|3.0|This is one of the most unusual reading experiences I've ever had. I don't really love this book, but I did read every word.    There are eight five-star reviews at the hardcover edition (and no dissent). Each is very short and says how sublime it is. I agree wholeheartedly that the guy can put a sentence together. Every page has something remarkable, purely in the sense of imagery or creative description. The aphorisms the narrator Lin attributes to his friends are almost always impressive, too. All of this (plus a close friend's strong recommendation) got me through the first four hundred pages. At that point the love interest sharpens (albeit only briefly), the narrator joins the Mumbai mafia, and things move along pretty well through the end.    His writing borders on the ornate or corny, I think--but I would say he keeps from stepping over that line. Barely! If you pick a page at random that is not loaded with conversation, you will surely find a sentence such as this one from page 358: \\"The eyes were unusually wide-set and large, giving him a slightly reptilian stare, and the marvelous lips were so full and sumptuously shaped that they seemed to be designed for a much larger head.\\" This is brilliant, to be sure, but there's an awful lot of this kind of thing. (\\"Questions writhed in my shivering mind\\"--page 648.) So much of the phrasing cries out, \\"Look at me!\\" I think of a pair of movies from the seventies--Fellini Satyricon and Barry Lyndon. Superficially very different, each of these was a feast for the eyes in which what was actually going on was secondary. If you liked them (as I did), you let the visuals wash over you, and the rest of it didn't matter too much. I prefer more story-driven films these days. Anyway, Shantaram is like those movies, if that isn't too wacky an analogy. It's a sensory experience first, and a literary one second.    So much for the style--and it is overwhelming, make no mistake. Give it five stars. Maybe you don't think you carefor the trombone, but this is the best trombone playing you're ever going to hear.    My greater quibble is with the story and the characterization. I find them both a little thin. An Australian escaped convict comes to Mumbai, detours to a rural village for a time, then returns to live in a slum and run a free health clinic. After a brutal term in jail, he moves from the slum, takes up with local gangsters, and winds up in more knife fights and gunfights than you can count, including a trip to Afghanistan to fight the Russians. (This is set in the mid-eighties.) He has a very spotty relationship with a woman, too. It's got a lot of potential as a framework, but the cast of characters is too long for us to start to care about any of them. In the second half of the book, as we start to understand the intricate and often violence-ridden web of intrigue, we've forgotten who is who, or don't know enough about them to deeply care about all the dirt they've done to each other. And they're all freaking hoodlums! You'll read a passage about the phosphorescent moonlight or some damned thing, and suddenly you're bleeding half to death in the middle of an ambush. It's Slumdog Millionaire without the happy ending.    And without the compelling main character! Lin takes us through a lot of scrapes, in full Technicolor, but even he is a cipher. My favorite line from the whole book comes in one of his infrequent periods of self-analysis: \\"Love's a one-way street. Love, like respect, isn't something you get; it's something you give.\\" That's good! I may remember it to my dying day. But it's abstract. In this world of cardboard figures, none of the relationships get to an emotional level. Nobody in this book is vulnerable or quite touchable (except Prabu). Nobody is really an individual! No wonder they all distrust one another, and go around hacking each other to bits.    Faulkner once said of Hemingway that he would never use a word that sent a reader to the dictionary. Hemingway responded, \\"Poor Faulkner, does he really think big emotions come from big words?\\" Shantaram isn't filled with big words, but it has a very big style, and its craftsmanship is precise--yet the emotion isn't there. I'm a huge cryer, and I didn't come close to shedding a tear for any of these people.
B00013VHI0|5.0|This album is soooo depressing, good Lord. If your feeling sad and want to stay that way then listen to this album because I cant see how it would cheer someone up.<br />That being said. Its a great album. Every song (except the second one) is great. The song Inner Silece is my song for my lost love Merideth S.<br />Alt. 4 is what got me started on Anathema. And after that I've been hooked ever since. While this is not my favorite Anathema albume (A Fine Day to Exit is) it stands as a must for any fan and for anyone who needs a release instead of blowing out ones brains.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Excellent album.  Brings back the 80's and a good original idea  (think Wham with Andrew Ridgely) with very good songs.  Hard to find outside of CD versions.<br /><br />Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, and Haley Bennett do a good job on the songs.  Well written lyrics that go well with the movie.  It's fun to listen to everyone once in a while compared to watching the movie again.
0684865130|1.0|The emperor has no clothes, and Joseph Heller has no writing ability<br /><br />I read this novel, all 42 chapters of it, for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Upon searching for the greatest novels of the 20th century Catch-22 was always either number 1 or number two.  I guess it IS number two because this novel (If you can even call it that) was S**T!  I rename it, Catch Number 2<br /><br />2. Once I start a novel, I finish it.<br /><br />3.  Because it's a \\"classic\\" I knew the pretentious fake fans would cry foul if I said I hated it yet never read past the 5th chapter, when i realized I was reading toxic waste.<br /><br />If you're truly honest with yourself you CAN NOT say this was a good book.  It was not a novel as I already mentioned, but rather a patchwork of asinine conversations, adolescent meaningless humor and plain old pointless babble.  Several hundred people gave his drivel 5 stars, while another 30 some-odd honest reviewers, both honest with themselves and with others, gave this one star.  I wish I could have given -773 stars.<br /><br />At first I thought the novel, as many others are, was a slow starter.  I thought the silly language would break and become...what's the word I'm looking for?  GOOD!<br /><br />I have read the reviews of the 1 star voters and found myself nodding my head yes, and strangely, the reviews were better reading than the 430 something pages of garbage.<br /><br />I can agree with the reviewer who said the book was an insult to those who have fought in VERY meaningful wars, as my father did in WWII, the war the book is based on.  I agree with the one who said this was a CHORE to read.  I'm no Kim Peek when reading, but I'm no slowpoke either.  This book took my 2 MONTHS to read.  I read ONE chapter a day then would discard it for 2 or 3 days and pick it up again, I hated the sight of it and left it in the toilet where I usually read it, I thought it would be happiest in its natural habitat.

B00006FDCD|5.0|Scary, scary, scary.  No doubt, the best King adaptation next to The Stand, and in this case, I thought the miniseries was better than the book.  A group of \\"loser\\" kids band together against a monster in clown form (oh, the delicious irony of clowns...)  Years later, their efforts are needed again.  You'll be hooked and filled with dread from the opening scenes of this miniseries. There are many familiar faces from television among both the adult and children \\"losers\\" including, the gone too soon, John Ritter. The second part is slower than the first part of the miniseries but that's just because Tim Curry was THAT GOOD!  Even so, the entire piece comes together for a satisfying conclusion.

0446677450|5.0|I have just completed the book and found it to be a great eye opener.  I suggest this book to everyone who wants to become financially independent. The practices taught in this book are applicable at any stage, but you have to be dedicated to achievement. It is easy to write off the practices as being for the wealthy but they are for anyone who is serious about wealth.  I recommend reading the book and then reading it again, then periodically reading as a renewal of commitment to one's self to get out of the rat race.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Since the brilliant and too-little noticed \\"Memento\\" many of us held our breath for the next construct of Christian Nolan's creative direction - and the wait was rewarded with brilliance. Nolan selected a great story, \\"The Prestige\\" which is impossible to transfer to a silver screen (or more and more, a digital one) and transformed it into a screenplay that communicates brilliantly from the screen, providing a riveting study of human interaction and truly obsessive/compulsive behavior. As we watch Christian Bale's and Hugh Jackman's characters continually escalate the violence of their contest for The Prestige of magicians' lore, we observe not just two deeply disturbed late-nineteenth century characters, but two brilliant performances (despite Bale's inability to maintain a non-American accent for more than a few lines) under cool Nolan guidance. You won't like the characters portrayed by Bale or Jackman - but you aren't supposed to. Instead, observe the actors' ability to inhabit the skins of their characters, and marvel. The twists and turns of plot are thrilling and the use of a technological miracle à la H.G. Wells is almost credible. Those who are unable to suspend irrelevant beliefs when they enter a movie-maker's world may be blinded to the real caliber of the performances by Nolan, Michael Caine as the calm provider of continuity and sanity, Jackman and Bale, even Sting. But if you are a buff of mystery, of period drama, of directorial excellence and consummate acting, this is a movie you will not just enjoy, but pull every once in a while from your library to enjoy yet again, even knowing the outcome.

B000063JDE|5.0|*Blue Velvet* is an American underground classic, which was made in 1986 by a surrealist director David Lynch. One can admire it or denounce as a perverse *theater of cruelty*. The film is all about juxtaposed opposites. For starters, it features a music score based on the music of the Russian classical composer Dmitri Shostakovich, juxtaposed against American rock-and-roller Roy Orbison, which is a unique combination.<br /><br />The main character of the movie - Jeffrey Beaumont - moves between two incompatible worlds: on the one side, the adolescent world of small town USA in the 50s with its high school and drugstore culture; and a violent, sex-crazed world of drugs, dementia and sexual perversion on the other.<br /><br />Incidentally, David Lynch is very much admired in Europe. In fact, most of his movies have been financed by the French.  I think the French admire Lynch because of his usage of double-layers of meaning in his cinematic language and use of Freudian themes. For example, in the movie the *yellow man* - one of the characters is identified through the yellow suite he wears - a yellow-jacket is a type of wasp, which is on WASP -white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. There is a Freudian theme, of course - the triangle between Dorothy Vallens (played by Ingrid Bergman's daughter Isabella Rossellini), Jeffrey Beaumont and Frank (played by Dennis Hopper) is an *Oedipal* (mother-father-son) triangle.<br /><br />In one of the central scenes the hero -Jeffrey - watches through a fissure in the closet door the sadomasochistic sexual play between Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper, games in which Hopper relates to Rossellini alternatively as his mother and his daughter. As Slavoj Zizek has pointed out in one of his books, this is the pure *original fantasy* or the fantasy of origins. He notes that the game is the *subject* of the topic, the content of the fantasy, whereas its object is the hero himself reduced to the presence of a pure gaze. The basic paradox of the fantasy consist in this (nonsensical) temporal short circuit where the subject (as pure gaze) precedes itself and whiteness its own origin. I highly recommend this film for everybody interested in psychoanalyses and non-traditional Hollywood cinema.e fantasy consist in this (nonsensical) temporal short circuit where the subject (as pure gaze) precedes itself and whiteness its own origin.

Overall, Love Letters of Great Men is an interesting book.

0525951113|4.0|I just discovered Daemon and author Daniel Suarez and I am hooked, hooked, hooked.<br /><br />From the look of the cover that promises us a high tech thriller to the very last sentence, author Suarez delivers a hard punch - no holds barred, wonderful technothriller that I could not put down once I started (which is quite a feat since this book is a little over 400 pages of thrill ride).<br /><br />IT is everywhere today and the concept of computers taking over the world is not new (think Terminator) however, Suarez writes about this in an innovative way that gave me the creeps (but in a good way).  We find two of our characters Jon Ross and Peter Sebeck entangled the Internet world -one trying to solve a murder and the other trying to figure out how to solve a major virus issue at his company.  This will all be linked to the legacy of a IT gamer who will trigger an IT world event.<br /><br />I am trying not to give too many details as it is alot more fun to read the story than to read my synopsis of it.  Suarez manages to take a subject that could be extremely dry and boring and weaves a story that is completely believeable and quite scary.  I kept thinking that Sarah Connor was going to walk into the storyline at any second.<br /><br />This book has everything a \\"real\\" thriller needs and on top of all of that, the story is entirely plausible, in my opinion.<br /><br />I suggest you give yourself lots of free time when you first start this book, as it will be very difficult to put down once you get into it.

031606792X|5.0|The plot takes the most fascinating turns in its final installment, and it was very difficult to put it down. I am really quite shocked to read some of these negative reviews, and I think there would have been an even bigger uproar if things had ended differently.    I don't really understand any of the negative reviews. I really loved this book, and thought it brought together the characters endings in a lovely way. The beginning scenes of the wedding and honeymoon were wonderful, and  I also hesitated at the first sign of the `little nudger', I thought the storyline was handled well. It kept me very interested, even if it was a little gruesome - hey, aren't we talking vampires here?   And the final part was great - with Bella so triumphant as a vampire, finally unburdened by her clumsiness, and we feel Edward's love for her so much more because he loved her when she was so imperfect and so breakable. I loved it, loved the ending, think it was a great book. I even love the fairytale cottage. I also didn't need a romance-novel love scene with specifics. This one was perfect. And Bella found that she had powers as a shield, she was able to shield her family, her friends, and the wolves.  In the very end when all was well and the ending of the book was near she also found that she could allow Edward to see how she had felt about him all along by letting her shield down and it was powerful.  This last book in the series really brought everything together into a great story.  I found throughout this series my self smiling, tearing up and pushing back the tears to complete parts, and then found myself laughing out loud.  This series is awesome and a must read for tweens and mothers alike.  ENJOY!!!!

B0010X745K|4.0|Frank Darabont's and Stephen King's third collaboration is a return to expected territory for Stephen King, and an unexpected turn to tightly wound horror for Darabont.  However, if the movie title evokes memories of John Carpenter's `The Fog' and its risible recent remake, don't be fooled.  Firstly, the horror when it happens is more intense, and secondly the movie sets out to be much more than just another creature feature.  So what happens?  It's a standard small Stephen King-style American town, following a storm.  A cross section of the town's society are in the supermarket when a mysterious fog rolls in - then a man runs out of the mist with blood on his face saying `there are things in the mist - they took my friends'.  So, the townsfolk hole up in the supermarket, and then follows the fascinating part of the movie. The creatures make their presence known, and an explanation of sorts for their appearance presents itself, but that is hardly the point.  It is the interaction of the townsfolk as they polarize, latent resentments surface and they feel the need to unite under a cause or leader, that the movie focuses on.  If the unhinged bible-basher is somewhat over the top (if not downright offensive) it is more than made up by a great cast, acting their hearts out - even a remarkably good Thomas Jane.  The controversial ending I think is perfectly in tone with this theme of exploring what people will do, and transcends the film from a mere creature feature or straight to DVD King movie, to a genuinely interesting piece of work that will spark thoughts and conversation long after the movie is over.  All in all, a thumbs up to this one, with gore in places and a moderate air of tension, but stirred to great effect with an interesting exploration of human nature.

Combine the spectacular footage, the perfect HD/Blu-Ray picture, and the master of nature narration, David Attenborough, and you have one of the best nature series ever created.  Some of the scenes in this series beg to be watched over and over!  Even if you're not a nature buff, you should watch this because if nothing else it is a great way to view the awesomeness of high-def videography.  If you ARE a nature buff, then there is one negative comment that you might want to be aware of : a lot of the coverage of the individual creatures is very brief since it covers the entire planet.  This can leave you wanting to know more about each of the creatures.  That being said, this is a must-own!!
B000YIGNKE|3.0|i loved the book. in the book Ann had such good judgment, understanding, and silent pride. in the 1995 version, or even the old 1970's? one, she had all these things. in this one she seems desperate, lonely, and weepy. she spends so much time crying and regretting things in the past that she can be embarrassing to watch. as for the male lead, he seemed to constantly be withholding things from her, his kindness, his regard, even the kiss at the end, and trying to punish her for the past that all i could say about him is [...]<br />there are too many characters crammed into this version it can be confusing at times. also, it is on youtube if you want to see it before you buy it.
B000X8AZTA|5.0|Bookbag is well made and will obviously last a long time.  Price was very reasonable as well.
0199536724|4.0|it was well written. there was quite a cast of characters but they were put in so gradually that it was easy to keep track of them. the story, being trapped somewhere between superstition and reality was also rather engaging. i would say that the beginning was strong and the end really lost it. with the clues given to the reader there is no way for them to guess the thief other than by luck. i am going to have to agree with Dickens on this one and say \\"when i got to the end i couldn't help but feel that my time had been wasted\\"
0061119725|5.0|My 4 year-old and my 16 month-old LOVE this book. I have had it since my firstborn was 20 months and it is still going strong. My daughter, the youngest, has loved this book for 3 months now, requesting it every night with her customary grunts. She is not verbal but is VERY active--a plus when reading this book as she tends to rush through all the other books we read or snatch them away to turn the pages by herself. She never does that with this book and when we are finished she turns right back to page one. This book is also a great gift for birthdays.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|it was very cute! the main characters are adorable around each other though i don't think that this Isabella is as good at the Isabella from the 80's version. and i don't think that mrs....mrs....the godmother gets much of a chance to show how silly about fashion she is. if you want to see the full length british version you can go to youtube.com.
B001NSLIW2|5.0|This is the best album ever by the greatest rock and roll group ever.  Each song is a symphony in it itself.  From the opening strains of Mike Pinder's \\"Lost In A Lost World\\" through the closing crescendo of John Lodge's anthemic \\"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock and Roll Band)\\" and all points in between, the Seventh Sojourn journey is a joyous voyage through clasic rock seas.  Justin Hayward's \\"New Horizons\\" and Ray Thomas' \\"For My Lady\\" are two of the most beautiful, melodic and uplifitng love songs ever recorded, and they are followed by Lodge's \\"Isn't Life Strange,\\" a transcendent triumph of classic rock power balladeering. The repeating guitar riffs of \\"You and Me\\" and the magical presence of \\"The Land of Make Believe\\" are worth the price of the album themselves. Pinder's \\"When You're A Free Man\\" is a moody masterpiece of every man's aspiration for inner peace and freedom. On the live tour which supported the album back in 1972, the Moodies peformed \\"Land Of Make Believe\\" and \\"When You're A Free Man.\\" Later and still today \\"I'm Just A Singer\\" and \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" would become their favorite songs to perform from this chart topping album.  Every track on Seventh Sojourn is meticulously and exquisitely crafted by a masterful group that was at the top of its game and the peak of its prowess at the time.  A triumph!
1593081251|4.0|i didnt like this one as much as i have like some of austens other works. there just seems to be some element of fun missing from it.
0553062182|5.0|A must for all of us HSP's out there.  I have a renewed self confidence after reading this book.  I also recommend the companion workbook to this series. It has lots of helpfultips for \\"shielding\\". Thank you to the author for helping me to understand I am not flawed.
B0007OY2P8|3.0|this was the first t.v. version of northanger abbey i ever saw. i like the General as well as Isobella, and i think that Cathrine and Henry are kind of cute but, the bad 80's music and the fact sometimes Henry seems to be talking just to sound smart was rather irritating
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|America, I mean the United States of America are changing sides, from Hollywood to Bollywood. They have to answer that unfair competition from the deprived Indians and go directly on their turf, since we can't really speak of a lawn, and bring the biblical truth to those pagans. That's what I found most fascinating at first: the image of the USA seen through the filter of Mumbai. First, make some simple questions fuzzy and difficult to capture. Moslems and Hindus are sure there but we don't know who is who. They speak the same language. No more difference really between Urdu and Hindi. Only the names of the main characters sound Moslem, that's all and the anti-Moslem pogrom or riot is just an unclear detail, especially since the dregs of this society are them, the Moslems. First serious blurred issue. The second is of course the problem of the Untouchables, the Dalits. They cannot be Moslems since they are a Hindu caste. And sure enough our characters who are living in the \\"slums\\" or shantytown, on the pile of garbage, are not Hindus, hence are not Untouchables. Then we are surprised because taking care of toilets is one of the tasks of these untouchables, or doing the washing for the fortunate who can afford that kind of service. So where are they? Invisible of course, but not in a city like Mumbai where there must be several millions of them. The episode of the little kid jumping into the toilet hole is just unthinkable for a Moslem child. If we go on with that fuzziness, we find out that the orphanage must be on the side of evil, since exploiting the Moslem orphans, hence Hindu. And the gangster who recuperates one of the boys when they are running away from the orphanage people after saving the girl and killing the main organizer of that begging and whoring ring, since he defines himself as the friend of the enemy of his enemies, must be Moslem. All that is unclear and that is done on purpose and it keeps some ambiguity about the Moslems in India without giving the slightest real knowledge about the real situation in India. But then of course we can speak of India itself and of its emergence from the mud-pit of the world. The picture that is given there is this time a reflection of and on what the West was fifty years ago, and some will say still are. Anything is good for these super poor people to do something to improve their lot, essentially by using any kind of opportunity that comes along that is half honest and half dishonest, like borrowing something that has been left somewhere like shoes at the entrance of a temple, but with the firm intention of not bringing them back and of making them circulate further for a little profit. This great poverty is not at all nurturing resignation but all the opposite, determination and the will to gamble everything to get up at least one step if not two. The film is entirely centered on a TV game, Questions and Answers that can lead the winner to 20 million Rupees. A game of punctual knowledge for a lot of money and nothing else. And yet out of that game popular fame is produced, the conviction that you can never keep people down longer than they will decide, that the survival instinct is nothing because it leads to killing, but the instinct to improve one's lot is a lot more stronger because it is supposed to lead to improving your lot in society itself. Then the story is of course a comedy because of the love affair that is intertwined and entangled in that story and the rewriting of Stephen King's \\"Running Man\\" (with Schwarzenegger) has become pleasant and even funny and not the gruesome drama of the model. The final scene is a typical Bollywood scene with hundreds of actors and actresses dancing in Mumbai's Victoria Station and it is some kind of cherry to top off the ice cream. This film will entertain you deeply if you try to use your brain to see the social discourse that is hiding behind the flashy and colorful surface.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en YvelinesUniversity Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B0015AARJI|3.0|Like I said in my title,Sony did a pathetic job when it came to hand comfort, the controller is too small, and also for a revolutionary product like the PS3, the remote is exactly same in design as the one for older PS2.    Very  disappointed that Sony cut corners, after giving a taste of the boomerang type controller first, and then tricked us by launching these dated looking controllers. Don't get me wrong the build and quality are good.     One other complaint, I had to buy trigger grips because my fingers kept slipping off the R2 and L2 buttons.
1439102813|5.0|Without warning, Lisa Genova's new novel ripped me away from my safe world of cognitive capability and threw me into the broken consciousness of patients I have seen during my four years in medical school. In describing early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), Dr. Genova - who earned a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Harvard University - presents a world previously unknown to all but EOAD sufferers and the specialists treating them. The author combines gentle humanity with a full-frontal assault on the way we traditionally have approached neurodegenerative disease in medicine, and she leaves us with a beautifully painted picture of a haunting pathology. This book should be required reading for all medical professionals.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|Released in 1976, The Song Remains The Same is footage taken on three nights in Led Zeppelin's 1973 concert at New York's Madison Square Gardens.  The band performs \\"Rock and Roll,\\" \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" \\"No Quarter,\\" \\"The Song Remains The Same,\\" \\"The Rain Song,\\" \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" \\"Moby Dick,\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"  The film is structured such that it starts off with a fantasy sequences and then shots of the band at home with their families before the tour starts, then there's documentary footage of the band arriving in New York and driving into Manhattan, before the concert begins. The onstage shots are largely of Robert Plant, with some of Jimmy Page, less of John Bonham, and really only one or two of John Paul Jones (who literally wears a heart on his sleeve).  Robert Plant is dressed in jeans, shirtless under a dainty vest, John Paul Jones is also pretty in some sort of Victorian garb, Jimmy Page is an alien in a star suit, and John Bonham a lad in white pants and a t-shirt.  The onstage footage is okay, but there's probably too much camera attention given to Robert Plant, rock 'n' roll's great Adonis, not nearly enough to Jimmy Page, rock 'n' roll's great Anubis.  For some of Page's solos the camera is elsewhere (such as on John Paul Jones during the amazing \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" solo, or on all the other members of the band when the crunchy riff of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" kicks in at the beginning of the song), or even when the camera is on Page during a solo the focus is too high and you can't see what he's doing with his hands, very frustrating.  During other solos the director cuts to a fantasy sequence or shows documentary footage.  Sometimes this works well, such as during the wanky 20-minute \\"Dazed and Confused\\" solo, but I'd liked to have watched the \\"No Quarter\\" solo.<br /><br />The fantasy sequence that start the movie is probably the best one, showing John Bonham, manager Peter Grant and tour manager Richard Cole dressed up as gangster hitmen driving an old-timer from one country estate to another, which they proceed to shoot up with machine guns.  Whoever their enemies are (one of them, apparently, is Roy Harper) is never explained, the episode is quite surreal.  Then it goes to the present day, Peter Grant is on a phone, a message is dispatched, a messenger delivers a letter to Robert Plant on his farm in Bron-Yr-Aur where he's watching his kids playing, the five-year-old Carmen Jane and the two-year-old Karac (who would, tragically, die of a viral infection four years after), John Bonham is plowing the fields with a tractor, John Paul Jones is reading \\"Jack and the Beanstock\\" to his daughters Jacinda, Tamara and Kierra, Peter Grant is driving an old-timer with a woman, Richard Cole is driving another old-timer to a pub, and Jimmy Page is playing a hurdy gurdy by the lake (he turns around, his shades glow orange and the world goes psychedelic).  John Paul Jones gets the only lines of any of the intro or fantasy sequences, when he reads the letter: \\"Tour dates!\\" (goofy grin).  \\"This is Tomorrow!\\" (look of dismay).  Cue Led Zeppelin's jet The Starship landed in New York, limousines, police escort, the pastoral \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" plays as the limos approach Madison Square Gardens.  Doves fly through the air.  We are in a dark, crowded space, the band seems to be onstage, we hear the massive drum intro to \\"Rock 'n' Roll,\\" then the lights come on and it's Led Zeppelin!!!!<br /><br />But you do see some Jimmy Page, there is even a nice shot that highlights drops of sweat that have fallen on his Les Paul. In many of the shots of Robert Plant, his crotch is in clear view and the shape of his genitals is quite clearly outlined through his tight jeans.  Great crowd shots, including scenes of girls in rapt attention, plenty of stoners, even black guys dressed like pimps. Cool theremin bits, including one blast in \\"No Quarter,\\" and plenty more in \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"  Too many non-band members in view in some of the shots, so it's not very intimate.  Bonzo working the drum, grimacing and gnashing his teeth, flicking his tongue.  Snatches of \\"San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair)\\" sung during \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" also the violin bow, and a slight bit of \\"Black Sabbath\\" at one moment.  There's a cool guitar jam at the end of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" that could probably even be considered a song of its own.  The camera work, while it was generally quite weak throughout, does some interesting things at times, such as going around 360 degrees as some points, and at one point in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" there is a cool split-screen mirror doubling thing, like Prince did in \\"When Doves Cry,\\" highlighting Jimmy Page playing guitar (and another of Robert Plant quadrupled.  Of course, in other parts you get the sense that shots from other parts of the night have been stitched edited together, and there is occasionally the feeling that what we're watching is authentic - apparently some gaps in footage were filled by having the band re-shoot on a recreated stage in 1974, aping their movements of that night in New York.  But the band is tight, and it is amazing how, after a 20 minute digression in the solo of \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" the band gets right back into the song without stumbling in the slightest.<br /><br />There are also subtly amusing bits, like when Robert Plant flashes the two-finger salute with one hand and the V for Victory with the other during the \\"you know sometimes words have two meanings\\" lyric.  Of course, there's also the famous \\"Moby Dick\\" drum solo where everyone goes off, that show Bonzo throwing away the sticks and using his hands to drum, splicing elegantly at one point to a clip of Jason Bonham on the drums - he must have been five years old in the shot.  Interesting in \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" you actually see Jimmy Page for the first time stepping up to the mic to perform some sort of backup vocals in the chorus, although you don't really hear him.  Why that song and no other?  Nice shot of Jimmy playing the theremin in \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" then Robert in Jimmy's underarm.  Cool shot of Orange amp head at 1:58:23.  Robert ad-libs a lyric \\"some are lined with gold - Acapulco Gold.\\"  They finish the set and Bonzo attacks a gong with a flaming mallet, and the gong frame lights up.  The band walks offstage, the house lights come on, and the band gets into their limo and moves on.  The band are seen at the airport getting into the Starship, and that's all there is.<br /><br />Besides the opening fantasy scene, four others appear throughout the movie; the first one spliced into the concert is John Paul Jones', which comes during a long organ and guitar interval in \\"No Quarter,\\" it shows him playing a huge church organ, then riding around in a mask with three other masked horsemen, before he returns home to a Victorian household and his beautiful wife and daughter (played by Jimmy Page's girlfriend at the time and their daughter).  Robert's fantasy scene is during \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" and \\"The Rain Song,\\" it shows him on a beach with a sword, riding around on a horse, galloping, eating a big red toadstool he found in the forest, the sword burning on the beach at night, a castle where he uses his falcon to attack people in the castle, then he goes up and has a sword fight, rescuing a damsel in distress.  Great long shot of him riding in the mountains, the camera pulls back to show the gigantic valley he's entering.  Jimmy's fantasy scene is in \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and shows a mountain at night, a full moon, Jimmy climbing up the mountain (the way renowned occultist and mountaineer Alistair Crowley, his idol, did on so many treacherous passes), kind of an odd thought for such an un-athletic person. He reaches a ledge where a man is standing, it is The Hermit from the Tarot deck (and also seen on the band's fourth album).  The Hermit lifts his head and regresses inage until you realise it's Jimmy Page, then a baby Jimmy, then a foetus in the womb, then a flash of lightning, then he ages again into The Hermit (later in Dazed and Confused\\" there's also a cool section where a shot of Jimmy freezes and the camera zooms up into his eye and cuts to a documentary scene). John Bonham's \\"fantasy\\" sequence in \\"Moby Dick\\" is more like shots of him hanging out with his family.  He's got shorter hair than he did onstage in 1973, and is shown with some sort of a mullet, playing pool, hugging his wife.<br /><br />Documentary clips that are interspersed show Robert and Peter talking, Peter Grant arguing about how they caught people selling bootleg material inside the venue - posters - and arguing with the venue manager about it, security cops and fans hanging around outside, a cop on horseback saying \\"no comment,\\" guys getting let in without tickets, a guy getting chased and nabbed and taken into a toilet by security cops, another guy getting ejected, there is also some footage concerning the lost $200,000, for which there was a press conference at the time and some of the people involved were taken in for questioning.<br /><br />The extras on the second disc are not bad, although there's nothing really remarkable there either.  There's a news report from a Tampa TV, showing lots of long-hairs and parking lots full of 1970s gas guzzlers, channel that is probably the crappiest bit of news reporting that I've ever heard, talking about the biggest crowd ever assembled in \\"the history of the world!!\\"  Yes, 50,000 people were there, and scraggly mustachioed John Jones reported on it.  \\"I'm pleased to say that one of the group's four members has my same name, that's John Paul Jones,\\" he cleverly points out.  He repeats himself, \\"Now, I said this was the largest single performance crowd ever to attend any concert in the history of the world, and I meant it!\\"  The host then jumps in and repeats John Jones' intro of the band: \\"Their names are Robert Plant, John Benham, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones.  Robert, Jimmy, John and John; doesn't quite have the appeal of John, Paul, George and Ringo, but they certainly have the drawing power of the Beatles.\\"  Hey - who's \\"John Benham?\\"  Sheesh.  There's also some more footage of the robbery of $200,000, a small part of which was put in the film, as ell as the original film trailer.  Then there's an 8-minute long interview with Robert Plant and manager Peter Green on a boat going down the Thames, not of much interest except when Robert hints at how they \\"rented the sharks,\\" referring to the infamous shark incident with the groupie.  There are four other tracks that weren't cut into the movie: \\"Over The Hills And Far Away,\\" \\"Celebration Day,\\" \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" and \\"The Ocean.\\"  All of the performances are straight, meaning no cutting into documentary footage or fantasy sequences.ugh you don't really hear him.  Why that song and no other?  Nice shot of Jimmy playing the theremin in \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" then Robert in Jimmy's underarm.  Cool shot of Orange amp head at 1:58:23.

B000000WGL|4.0|I've been reading a number of older blogs lately in which guitarists weighed in against the \\"100 Greatest Guitarist\\" list published by Rolling Stone magazine.  One of the biggest knocks on the list (and there are too many criticisms to even name-many of them perfectly valid) was the inclusion of Keith Richards (at #10, I believe).      There were a number of glaring omissions to the list (such as Alex Lifeson of Rush), and some inclusions that seemed to have little to do with ANY kind of technical prowess (example: Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Lou Reed-all great artists that never wrote ONE memorable riff that I could actually recall).  But the one thing that REALLY bothered me about the overall tenure of the comments was the way guys were teeing off on Richards.    Keith Richards is one of the most prolific riff creators in rock history.  \\"Start Me Up\\", \\"Midnight Rambler\\", \\"Satisfaction\\", \\"Beast of Burden\\", \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Honky Tonk Women\\", \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\", \\"Paint It Black\\"...the list goes on and on.  Every one of these classic Rolling Stones songs is built on Keith's initial guitar riff.  How many guitarists have a resume' like that??      The brilliance of Keith Richards is his ability to serve the song, and the band, with his playing.  He isn't a brilliant soloist.  He is an expert collaborator with: 1) unique tone, 2) a great sense of rhythm, 3) an uncanny ability to \\"turn the beat around\\", 4) the ability to move around inside the structure of a song with soulful riffs.    If you have ever wondered what his contribution to the Rolling Stones' success truly was, this album is a good indicator because much of his playing style/attitude is more conspicuous here without the presence of Mick Jagger, whose larger-than-life personality can sometimes over-shadow other aspects of the music.  Keith is the heart and soul of one of rock's all-time greatest bands. If you want to hear what the Rolling Stones might sound like WITHOUT Richards, try Mick Jagger's \\"Primitive Cool\\" album-a disgrace!  \\"Wandering Spirit\\" was a fabulous solo record from Jagger, but only because producer Rick Rubin went out and found a Keith Richards clone to fill the void...     As a guitar player myself, I can honestly say that some of the most technically gifted musician's I have ever met were the worst people to have around.  The reason is because many of them were so self-indulgent and over-bearing that they viewed songs as a mere pretense to showcase their playing.  Many soloists can't seem to get out of their own way (or any one else's) long enough to allow a song to evolve into something enjoyable.  Many soloists can't understand that ensemble playing is infinitely more interesting than watching some guy wanking!      Furthermore, most two-guitar bands evolution can be traced right back to Keith Richards and his ability to interlace his playing with the 2nd guitar of the group (be it Brian Jones, Mick Taylor or Ron Wood).  Listen to vintage Aerosmith, Guns 'n' Roses or even AC/DC.  The seeds that Richards planted with the Rolling Stones are there.    At any rate, buy this disc and enjoy it!  It should fit nicely in your cd case between the Rolling Stones \\"Tattoo You\\" and \\"Voodoo Lounge\\".
1401216676|5.0|This book shows not only the origins of the Joker but also sheds some light on the unusual relationship between the Joker and Batman that they are similar in some facets but different in how they view the world. This book is well written and well drawn and does a better job at depicting the sinister tendencies of the Joker than both movie and any TV incarnation of him ever did in overall a five star ratting highly recommended for fans of Batman or anyone who enjoys reading stories with a character who is truly off the wall.

0316017922|5.0|I picked up this book after achieving a professional milestone and feel the need to relax and take my mind off computers for a while. By the end of this book I am so motivated that I am ready to tackle other big projects again. Why? This book reaffirms the idea that as long as you are 'smart enough' you can achieve great things in life with hard work, persistence, and the right circumstances. The first two are absolutely necessary in order to take advantage when the opportunity knocks on the door. There is a systematic approach and pattern to the 'outliers' of the society.     This book also makes me realize that whatever I have achieved in life, I did not do it alone. The high school teacher who encouraged me to participate in AP classes, the college professor who gave me the intern opportunity, the manager who hired me without any relevant experience, even my Asian cultural background may have played a part. As an individual, we are in debt to so many people who have helped us. This is an interesting and inspiring book, high recommended.
B00004Y6Q5|1.0|For anyone who has heard the \\"primary\\" piece (Lux Aetera) by Masell via Youtube or some other source on the internet, be aware that the full song is *NOT* on this DVD - and most of the DVD is terrible, synthesized trash that doesn't flow or sound good at all.    If anyone knows where to get the full song that I'm hearing used in movie trailers, on Youtube, and elsewhere, please post and let me know ;-) as I love the full song.
B00006IUL7|5.0|I bought this movie from this website, and I have to say that it was a good, tense thriller. Al Pacino's performance as the detective was good, but it's worth watching to see Robin Williams' performance as the killer. His performance was top notch. This is the dark side of Robin Williams unleashed. A great thriller for fans of the thriller genre.

B001N26GFC|3.0|i feel like the character of Poppy and the performance by Sally Hawkins are to good for the film they reside in. the plot is pretty much non-existent and the great charecters deserve more. the film picks up a bit at the end, and the film concludes on a somewhat thought provoking note, but overall, its the weak story that makes the film unengaging. thank god that Sally Hawkins is magnetic on screen or the film would have been a complete bust.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|its fantastic to see that Woody Allen, who has made over 40 films and is in his 70s, is still taking chances as an artistic filmmaker. This is a departure for him and his body of work. The narrative and characters are guided along by a narrator which is an inspired touch (and a first for allen, i believe). The script was more dramatic and nuanced rather than outright funny and the characters were much deeper than I anticipated. The visual style is fantastic as always and the movie is seriously, dizzyingly, beautiful. The acting here is fantastic, everyone turned in terrific performances and Cruz stole the show with her every scene. This is a thought provoking and extremely complex piece of art which fits perfectly into the fantasy world Allen has created for himself.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This is a great Batman movie - the story (e.g. why he is who he is, why he dresses up like a bat, why he has a cape) actually makes sense and is not corny like some Batman movies....It's a different take on some of the characters (e.g. scarecrow) and I think it works much better - no Mr.Freeze!! Very entertaining movie and I highly recommend if you like superhero movies.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|the 'high school musical' series seems like it was meant to be on the big screen. this final installment is less cheesy, more fun and actually touching. it brings back memories of 'grease', the good old fashioned musical movie. director kenny ortega and his gifted and grateful (testament to the 'curtain credits') cast has instilled the love of musical theater into an entire generation and for that, this film is a success.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|This is the kind of thing I've wanted to hear from McCartney for a long time. I guess it's the influence of Youth. To have McCartney's tendency to the sweet (verging on saccharine) tempered by a harder edge leaves us with a very palatable and substantial confection. It's downright nourishing.<br />Remember that the man who sang such tunes as My Love and the retch-worthy Ebony and Ivory also composed stuff like Why Don't We Do It in the Road.<br />Aside from his first solo album this will be the McCartney music in heaviest rotation for me.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|i rather liked this curious little 007 film. it essentially 'casino royale: part 2' and on that merit it works well. at times its deeper than the first but also much more shallow. the cinematography is breathtaking and the action scenes are impeccably made. daniel craig is officially my favorite james bond.
B0018CMJSU|2.0|Since I bought this boxed set primarily for the Supplements, I will focus on those featurettes to hopefully help others decide whether or not to buy this edition for themselves.<br /><br />Firstly, there are two discs of Supplements.  (The back of the slipcase's listing for the contents of Disc Four and Disc Five are reversed so that what is listed for Four is actually on Five and vice versa.  Somebody screwed-up.)<br /><br />The supplements are as follows, along with my comments.<br /><br />1) Making of the Godfather (a.k.a. \\"Behind the Scenes\\"):  This is a bit confusing as there is \\"The Making of the Godfather\\" listed on the slipcase, but on the Disc this section is entitled \\"Behind the Scenes\\" and includes some of the items I single out below to discuss. \\"A Look Inside\\" is the first and longest section and covers alot of ground.  It is amazing to watch the screen tests of Al Pacino and, when the studio was still unsold on Pacino, we see James Caan being tested for the role of Michael!  And DeNiro being screen tested for the part of Sonny!  And Martin Sheen even is shown briefly reading for the part of Michael!  This is wonderful stuff to see.  Unfortunately, Brando's screen test is absent (it is minimally shown in a later extra, but I have seen much fuller footage of this historic screen-test elsewhere, and it SHOULD have been included in somewhere amongst these extras in a more extensive form.  It also seems that with \\"Behind the Scenes\\", way too much effort is expended in trying to push and promote the dubiously meritorious third installment of the Corleone saga.  We also learn practically nothing about Mario Puzo -  where he came from and where he came up with his ideas and what research was involved. Did a horse-head type incident ever happen in reality?  Was  the Johnny Fontane character truly based on Frank Sinatra and his bid for \\"From Here to Eternity\\"? Things like that. There is also nothing of the Italian-American Civil Rights League's initial opposition to the production of the film. No discussion of the actual history of the Mafia is offered, even briefly. It would have been most interesting to say the least. And no mention is made of the great John Cazale's (Fredo)enormous contribution to Godfather parts I and II. On a scale of 1-10, this feature rates a 6, primarly because of the screen tests that are shown.<br /><br />2)  Additional scenes:  I found these to be very interesting, some of course much more than others.  But on the whole, these deleted scenes from the three films are quite illuminating.  It is nice to know that Michael eventually avenges his Sicilian wife's death.  It is great to see Tom Hagen's wife, too!<br /><br />3)  Filming Locations:  Interesting, but way too short.  The only location actually discussed is the use of a real street in the East Side of lower Manhattan.  Mention is made of a contemporaneous film student documenting the making of Godfather II on this street - and some of that documentary is shown.  It would have been nice to have seen the entire documentary, though.  But, given the world-wide backdrop of the Corleone saga, one would think that this featurette would have been more encompassing.<br /><br />4)  The Corleone Family Tree:  this is simply a graphic.  Pure padding.<br /><br />5)  The Music of the Godfather:  Simply a tape recording that Coppola made of Nino Rota playing various tracks on piano and a bit about Carmine Coppola that amounts to an exercise in nepotism.  I still haven't learned what Carmine did to deserve sharing the Oscar with Nino Rota.  This feature could and should have had so much more.  Commentaries by other film composers would have been wonderful.  This feature is short and lame.<br /><br />6)  The Godfather Historical Timeline, Filmaker Profiles, Photo Galleries and Storyboards:  More padding.  Mainly text and stills.<br /><br />7)  Coppola's Notebook:  This is a sub-section  of the \\"Making of..\\" While interesting to see how the director annotatedthe novel and broke it down into sections and kept all his notes in a big binder that - if it had been lost - was to be returned to Paramount for reward money...how much more interesting it would have been to learn more about Puzo's creation of the characters and the research involved.<br /><br />On Disc 5, which is actually Disc 4, we find the following:<br /><br />1)  Godfather World:  A quick overview of the cultural impact of the films.  Mildly interesting - but it mainly focuses on spoofs, cartoons and \\"The Sopranos.\\"  The deeper, darker aspects of its impact are not explored.  This is mainly fluff - whereas it could have been a truly heady discussion with alot of talking heads involved.  I would loved to have heard what the actual crime family members made of the trilogy. Did John Gotti dig it? I would like to have heard from folks who hated the movies, also.  The Godfather making its way into Homer Simpson's world is amusingly interesting, but there are deeper ways in which the films have impacted and even changed American and world culture.  Few films have such an impact.  In not analysing this impact on a more serious level, this featurette falters.<br /><br />2)  The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't:  This details Coppola's studio struggles - which are most interesting - but, again, there is nothing about the initial Italian-American boycott of the making of the film.  It was a stiff opposition and a tale that should have been told herein.  Studio opposition to Brando is mentioned, and all of two seconds of Brando's impromptu screen test are shown - but this featurette (as well as \\"Behind the Scenes\\") really doesn't examine Brando's contribution in any profound detail.  It would have been wonderful to see how his performance shaped the film and how the film resurrected him.  Somewhere in these two discs of extras, more should have been said about Brando.  Very little is.<br /><br />3)  When the Shooting Stopped:  A brief look into some editing aspects.  Interesting, but not what I thought the title implied, and that was a  deeper look at immediate reactions and potential repurcussions to the crime families at the time.<br /><br />4)  Emulsion Recuse:  Technical tour of the restorations.  Interesting if you like tech-talk.<br /><br />5)  The Goddather on the Red Carpet:  Total garbage!  I thought this would have included coverage of the Oscar nights for all three installments of the Godfather saga, including the controvery surrounding Brando's win - and instead we get lame reactions about the impact the movie made on, of all people, the stars and makers of 'Cloverfield' while they stroll the red carpet.  Total padding, total nonsense.<br /><br />6)  Four Short Films: These are nothing more than more pointless padding.  One is a short discussion on the relative merits of GF I versus II; one is a stupid \\"riffing\\" on Godfather issues with two comedians that is mercifully short. Blink and you'll miss it.  The last two deal with cannolis and Clemenza and are just as pointless.<br /><br />On a whole, on the 1-10 scale, I would give the extras a 6.  They were good - but could have been much, much better.<br /><br />One last note on \\"Godfather III\\" which I had never seen until I bought this set:  at about the point of the helicopter attack on the assembled mafiosos, I half-expected to see James Bond enter the picture!  Also...some of the dialog in the film is hardly better than that in a soap opera - and some of it is unintentionally downright laughable. I also haven't seen such a dragged out ending (the opera house sequence) in years.  And it is all so confusing, this installment, and the death of Michael's daughter is so utterly contrived that I couldn't believe this film had been made by the same man responsible for I and II.  Anyway -  I saw the boxed gift set in a store and, what can I say, it was an offer I couldn't refuse.ig binder that - if it had been lost - was to be returned to Paramount for reward money...how much more interesting it would have been to learn more about Puzo's creation of the characters and the research involved.

B0018RWD1S|4.0|I had the first release of Frank but someone else has it. So bought this one since it was a little more than $3 more but had 2 disc instead of one. So you will know on the track Amy Amy Amy there are 2 additional songs. They are Brother and Mr. Magic. To me disc one is good except for Moody's Mood For Love. Your milage may vary as we all have differing taste. The reason this is a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the 2nd disc. Just for the most part differant versions of the same songs on the 1st disc. However the demo versions Amy has a better voice. Not sure what is going on with that. The song Round Midnight does sound real good so not a total waste. If you can get a copy of the Regular Frank cd do so instead of this one.
0385340990|3.0|Epistolary novels can be such fun to read, and this one is certainly no exception. The technique of using the exchange of letters to tell the story allows the author to use each character's voice in an authentic way that traditional story-telling doesn't usually allow. In tone, I found this book similar to the delightful 84, Charing Cross Road. Juliet, the main character, or main letter-writer as the case may be, has a guileless voice that was a pleasure to read.<br /><br />The one false note I found in this story was the ease with which the Guernsey Islanders allowed Juliet to adopt Kit (both literally and figuratively). That Kit herself should take to Juliet as well as she does I did not find surprising, as one can clearly tell from her letters that she is the kind of person children like (and, yes, that is high praise). But for a group as insular as the Islanders declare themselves to be, and as protective of and attached to Kit as the Literary Society was, to give Kit over to Juliet after only a few months acquaintance, did not ring as true as the rest of the story did.<br /><br />Other than that, I loved this book. Each character has a distinct voice, and I wanted to be able to exchange letters with them all myself.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|A beautiful album like all Enya works.  It is mostly a Christmas album but definitely non traditional.  I personally do not like it as well as Amarantine.

0307387178|4.0|From first glance, Into the Wild appears to be a suspenseful tale of Chris McCandless's adventures. However, the book is actually in a different format than one would think, and there is little suspense, as his fate is known before you begin reading. That aside, I enjoyed reading this book very much. Krakauer skillfully retraces Chris's steps, and tries to connect Chris with himself and other legendary adventurers, in an attempt to figure out why he did this. Krakauer also uses interviews with Chris's family and friends to show the reader his character and show connections from his childhood to his desire to go and live in Alaska. Krakauer used highly detailed descriptors and crafty language to paint a mental picture of every scene in the book. I found Krakauer's story of his own Alaskan adventure very interesting and a good compliment to the book. Even after reading the book, however, I still do not get why Chris made this decision, and share the opinion of many that he should have been better prepared. This is simply the way I am, and I share no similarities with Chris in terms of his adventurous spirit. However, that did not make the book any less enjoyable to read. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody.
B00000JG41|4.0|Here's what would likely happen if you fell asleep listening to this album.    You are drifting away into a dream, except its not a dream. Something about this dream is familiar..as if you've dreamed about a long time ago as child, which seems like centuries ago. You are in the late 2000's (as the people in the 1950's envisioned it). It is not crowded though, rather the population has heavily decreased. But right now you are on a tropical island, feeling as if your high, but not from drugs.from something else. You feel like a child again. Its as if your in a dream. You have no worries. You are in a dream like state, until something awakes you. You are all the sudden thrown into this mass hysteria of a city in Metropolis. people are flying around seemingly trying to get somewhere but just rushing aimlessly. Almost as if you are some sort of cartoon. Then, you are lifted up into the sky, as a dreamy ballad floats you up through the sky. the day turns into night, the sky turns green. you are floating among the stars in a universe you couldn't even describe. You feel so small, like an infant. Then, you fall back down to earth, and you find another human being! another human! He sings to you, the world breaks out into a musical, your not sure what he's saying. but you feel relief anyways. But then, that relief is gone. You are all of a sudden in a panicked state. you are alone, but your not at the same time. You are running through a dark maze, and you see grotesque smiling heads appearing randomly out of thin air, and they are laughing at you. It is a nightmare that your desperately trying to wake up from. And everywhere you turn, you are terrified of another floating head popping up (even though they can't do anything to you, just their presence causes terror).   Finally, the album ends.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|On X-Mas Eve in Tokyo, three homeless people, find an abadonned baby lying in the rubbish. The trio: Gin, an ex-gambler; Miyuki: a runaway teenage girl; Hana: a drag queen, decide to find the child's parents. They name her Kiyoko, and then look through some belongings that were left with the child for clues to her origins. A trip to a family cemetery finds them running across a yakuza boss who they help out from nearly getting run over by his own car. He takes them to a club that they found a business card for with Kiyoko, which turns out is where the dom's daughter is getting hitched that day. Once there, Gin realizes that the groom is the man who caused him to become poor years ago from a jibbed bet, but before he can try to get at him, a hitwoman accidently shoots the groom while trying to kill the dom. Miyuki and the baby are kidnapped by the hitwoman, while Gin and Hana seperate after arguing. Gin runs into an older homeless man, and he gets injured while protecting him from some punks. Hana meets up with Miyuki who escaped with Kiyoko, and they go to an Hana's old bar for drag queens, where they find Gin who was taken into care for his injuries. They later run into a woman who appears to be Kiyoko's actual mother, however she's instead suicidal, and it's up to the homeless trio to save Kiyoko in a great comedy/traumatic fashion.<br /><br />This movie was directed by Satoshi Kon, who also did the movies Millenium Actress, Perfect Blue, Paprika, and the Adult Swim series, Paranoia Agent. This was a distinct departure from his normal supernatural/surrealistic thrillers. It was partially based on the western movie, 3 Godfathers. For Kon, this was a great piece of storytelling. The characters are very entertaining and believable. His appear to be more realistic looking than most anime characters. Not all the girls are thin with big hooters, and not all the guys look like girls with long spikey hair.<br /><br />What makes this a great movie for X-Mas is there are so many points in it where you actually believe some of the plot devices or coincidences are genuine \\"Christmas Miracles\\". There's so many revelations about the characters lives as the story moves along, and how the all culminate at one of the most satisfying anime movie conclusions ever is really special. The other reason its a great title for the holidays is because its one of the few ones that isn't the special \\"Christmas episode\\" of an already existing anime series, and is great to see on its own merit.it where you actually believe some of the plot devices or coincidences are genuine \\"Christmas Miracles\\".

0783227434|4.0|I personally love this movie. With its hilarious campiness, and brilliant one-liners, its a must for any cult/Bruce Campbell fan. But if your reading this, chances are you already know its a great movie. I give it four stars instead of five because of the lack of extras on this DVD. Its got a few production notes and some brief cast bios, and the trailer of course, but thats about it.   But if all you care about is watching the movie, than you should definately buy it. Hurry! Before amazon raises the price.
B0013USZHG|5.0|This is an excellent example of highly talented musicians (for many and me included) and one the world's best contemporary Conductors.  It is the result of the soul and vision of Venezuelan best musical movement ever been deployed since its beginnings in 1975, led by Maestro Jose Antonio Abreu.  These Musicians and Dudamel have nothing to do with Hugo Chavez and it's so called \\"revolution\\".  They just happen to come from the same country with opposite's values and results.  Please, disregard any comments on any relationship of this orchestra and its conductor with Hugo Chavez.  They are just too far apart and should not even be mentioned in the same paragraph.  These musicians belong to the best of humankind while Chavez in the other side belongs to the worst nightmare for Venezuela.

B00028HBKM|5.0|I am so glad that this movie was made about the things that Jesus, the Son of God endured for us! I felt Jesus's pain! I cried!<br /><br /> This movie will give a real idea of how it was with Jesus, during his final days, and of how sorry, and low down, and cruel people can be. Jesus did not deserve to be treated that way! This movie showed how strong, and wise Jesus is. He has alot of courage, and goodness!<br /><br /> When Jesus comes back to earth again, people will wished that they had a asked Jesus to come into their life, and got saved, and baptised, when they had a chance to do so. People will wished that they had taken the time to learn more about him. Why not read the HOLY BIBLE once in awhile, and learn about God and his son Jesus, while you can! This is the only way to the third heaven!<br /><br /> One of my favorite scenes in the movie, is where a hugh teardrop falls from heaven, showing God's sorrow over his son Jesus on the cross!

B001K98MFK|5.0|FINALLY - GITS2: Innocence with English dialog!  I saw this in the theater when it was originally released and have waited and waited for it to be released with an English dub.  Dreamworks really mucked things up when they released this on DVD several years back as they didn't bother to dub it into English.  This is the deluxe edition with metal DVD case and additional soundtrack disc - I wish that Amazon would have noted that in the description as I would have waited for the \\"standard\\" version to be released as I don't really need a metal DVD case nor do I need a soundtrack disc.  (Note that the standard version has been released - for whatever reason Amazon didn't list it until closer to the release date and it wasn't available when I pre-ordered).  While this has been dubbed into English using the same character voices as the other GITS releases (Standalone Complex, 2nd Gig, Solid State Society, etc), there are some bits of Japanese language that remain and are subtitled in English.<br /><br />My only gripe is with Amazon who waited 6 days after the set was released to ship it out even though I had pre-ordered it well in advance.  Total time for me to receive this was 12 days after the release date.  I doubt I'll pre-order with Amazon again because of this.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|If anyone has seen \\"The Condemned\\" it is along the same line as that. The economy is in poor shape and they take convicts and kill them over the television and internet.

B00005RIKI|5.0|REVIEW: The members of Lynyrd Skynyrd all hailed from Jacksonville, Florida where they attended the same high school (even taking the name of gym coach Leonard Skinner as their group moniker). They developed a reputation for wild on-stage performances that only increased after going on tour with The Who in 1973. Famed producer/singer/songwriter Al Kooper (Blues Project; Blood, Sweat, and Tears; and the \\"SUPER SESSIONS\\" LP with Mike Bloomfield and Stephen Stills) scouted them out while looking for fresh talent to record on his newly launched Sounds Of The South label for MCA. The rest is history. The triple threat lineup of guitarists Gary Rossington, Allen Collins, and Ed King would become the template for all Southern rock bands; and lead singer Ronnie Van Zant's tough-yet-tender vocalizing would come to symbolize the true meaning of what a rock frontman should be. Bassist Leon Wilkerson and drummer Robert Burns help to push the band to its collective limits, and the piano playing of Billy Powell adds a whole new dimension to every track with his burning keyboard runs and honky-tonk sensibility. The songs? \\"I Ain't The One\\", \\"Tuesday's Gone\\", \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", \\"Simple Man\\", \\"Things Goin' On\\", \\"Mississippi Kid\\", \\"Poison Whiskey\\", and the climatic \\"Free Bird\\" are all FM radio staples which makes \\"PRONOUNCED\\" one of the most astonishing debut recordings in music history. Another big, BIG plus: the record kicks some major a*s!!!    HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 27    HIT SINGLES: \\"Free Bird\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 19)ou'll love and understand\\" and not to forget \\"there is Someone up above\\" (on \\"Simple Man\\") makes his southern-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold-who-can-still-kick-your-a*s persona even that much more appealing. \\"Gimme Three Steps\\" and \\"I Ain't The One\\" also shows he has a sense of humor while \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" and \\"Free Bird\\" are just flat-out gorgeous. As far as the content goes: there is some adult subject matter to contend with including the sexual escapades of \\"South Side Jukin'\\" (the word \\"jukin'\\" is slang for intercourse), and a bit of violent braggadocio in \\"Mississippi Kid\\" that should earn the LP a CAUTIONARY rating.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 27    HIT SINGLES: \\"Free Bird\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 19)
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is a wonderfully creative twist on \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" where a modern London girl, Amanda Price, enters the story she has been dreaming of her whole life...right at the beginning...she knows all but can't make things happen quite the way it happened in the Austen novel.  Meanwhile Elizabeth Bennett takes up residence in Modern Day London.  If you know P&P and esp. if you are familiar with the Colin Firth movie version, you will be Laughing OUT LOUD!!!

B001PPGAIA|5.0|I saw Australia when it was released in November, I had heard so many mixed reviews about it. But I have to say I was blown away, the movie is FANTASTIC, the story line is strong, the characters are awesome. Nichole Kidmand and Hugh are fantastic together. The other cast, Bryan Brown, and the rest are all awesome. This is your typical Australian film with the lingo to go with it. The scenary is fantastic it wan't to make you go there.   I can't wait for it to come out on onto dvd so I can have my copy and watch it over and over again.   I never listen to moview reviers , as I prefer to go and see a movie for myself and judge. And this movie is one for EVERYONE. Go out and watch before it comes out on DVD. You have to see the beauty of it on the big screen. The special effects are amazing. go and see AUSTRALIA.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|It's been a long while since anyone reviewed this CD and I have to say that it's still holding strong in my mass listening library. Mark Knopfler plays beautiful guitar and although his voice is not very lyrical, the songs suit him. He has since moved on to other projects since this gem came out in 1978. Some are well worth listening to including his latest, \\"Kill to get Crimson\\" and  something completely different in \\"Neck to Neck\\" with Chet Atkins.    Not all of his projects have been successful in my opinion. In fact, much of it seems experimental. But this Cd has great guitar playing and good lyrics. The band was fresh and tight. Of course, it was studio produced but the sound is not over mixed like in so many recordings these days. If you appreciate good R&B and guitar playing, check out this band in its first release. And \\"Sultans of Swing\\" (the song which got the most air time) is my least favorite on the list.
B000YENUI6|4.0|If the BBC produced a drama pulling back the veil on the Russian mob in London (which they did), Eastern Promises would be that movie (which it is).  A few scenes of extreme graphic violence aside, 'Promises' is built of more subtle dramatic ingredients than what most American audiences have come to expect from an Action Flick.  Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, and the supporting cast turn in fully drawn, nuanced performances.  Speaking personally, this is the movie that has me take notice of Watts as a dramatic actress in a way I hadn't before.  All of the  research that went into the making of this film pays off, giving us a rich, detailed look at a real-life underworld uncomfortably close to home.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I am blown away by John Mayer. If you haven't seen this DVD, don't wait! It showcases his talent, diversity, and originality in every way. His voice is mesmerizing, his lyrics are endearing without being too sappy, and his guitar playing is incredible. His bluesy roots come through but you don't have to be a  blues fan to get addicted. An incredible talent caught on film. You just have to see and hear it!

1591396190|4.0|As a strategy consultant, I am always looking for new methods, frameworks, and tools related to corporate strategy. This book, Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make Competition Irrelevant, presents a simple, cohesive, and practical framework to think about value innovation and corporate strategy. The core concepts of the book, red oceans and blue oceans, are intuitive and lead to interesting insights. The authors present some unique case studies and provide a plethora of visual tools and strategies to implement blue ocean concepts.    So what are red oceans and blue oceans? Red oceans are contested market space where existing competitors struggle with each other for customers and profit. This ocean that they exist in is bloodied by competition, and is not where you want your company to be. Blue oceans are uncontested market space, pools of demand and customers that have not been reached by any competitor. The reason for this is that the blue ocean is masked by conventional wisdom and product/service design. To open blue oceans, companies must look at their products, customers, non-customers, and industry in new ways. This book provides tools to accomplish this and illustrates them well with examples such as Cirque Du Soliel and Southwest Airlines.    The book has been criticized for being simplistic, catchy, and for borrowing concepts from others. However, when you look at corporate strategy, it is a field which has been examined thoroughly and completely. Hundreds of frameworks, concepts, and tools have been developed and re-hashed. When I think about strategy, this is not the only framework I'm going to use, which is okay. I'm not looking for one solution to all problems. What this book provides is a fresh way of looking at competitive strategy and some simple tools. This book is not a weighty tome, is quick to read, and is easy to understand. This is something I relish. As a strategy consultant, I work alongside my clients to critique current strategies and develop strategies for the future. In that context, simple is better. This book tries to keep things simple and does not bog things down with weighty research and financial analysis. To some, this will be a deal-breaker. There are strategy people out there who think that coming up with presentation full of scientific looking research methodologies and reams of spreadsheet analysis means they've done their job. This is not the case. Developing a blue ocean strategy is not a simple process. You should do your due diligence and consider financial analysis and market projections. However, you cannot let these things bog you down. This is why so many strategies fail or are never implemented.    This book is not a panacea which will show you how to dominate your market. It isn't meant to be. What you will gain from this book is another way of thinking about strategy, some useful tools, and case studies to illustrate how to use things. The rest is up to you.    Key Reasons To Buy:        * Concise and easy to understand      * Presents intuitive and applicable concepts related to strategy and innovation      * Provides tools and case studies to illustrate concepts as well as conceive/execute blue ocean strategy on your own    Perceived Weaknesses:        * Some frameworks are derivative in nature      * Research is not rigorous or quantitative

B001KL3GWM|5.0|I am already a Derek Trucks band fan.  The band is extremely diverse musically, playing everything from Delta blues, R&B, latin, soul, gospel, and jazz fusion to Pakistani qawwali ... and they continually reinvent the songs they play (e.g., the many versions of Soul Serenade).  Already Free seems more focused, and more polished, than the band's other studio work ... perhaps because they had all the time they wanted in the new Trucks/Tedeschi home studio.      Already Free has a throwback feel, and seems to build on the Soul Stew Revival theme that Derek and his wife (Susan Tedeschi) were promoting in their recent tour.  In an interview with Ryan Sparks, Derek described it as domestic/American roots, and less \\"in your face and obvious\\" than prior work.  In his words: \\"It doesn't feel like there's something to prove or that it has to have extended guitar solos all over the place.  Not that the next record won't have that, but I feel this was a nice diversion from that and a much more song oriented record.\\"       I bought the \\"Down in the Flood\\" MP3 before the album's release, and loved it from the start.  The song (a Bob Dylan cover) starts out acoustic and soulful, shifts to electric and funky, and builds to a crescendo (i.e., second guitar solo) like many of my favorite DTB tunes. Other immediate favorites: \\"I Know\\", \\"Down Don't Bother Me\\" (very different from past live performances) and \\"Sweet Inspiration\\" (a classic that Carlos Santana apparently convinced the band to play).  The remainder of the album ... particularly \\"Something to Make You Happy\\", \\"Days is Almost Gone\\" and \\"Our Love\\" ... grew on me the more I listened and adjusted to the different tone of this new album.      Already Free has been criticized as a step back from Songlines, and for having a \\"mainstream\\" or \\"commercial\\" sound.  Personally, excluding \\"Chevrolet\\" and \\"Crow Jane\\", I think that the best of Songlines was drawn from material that the band was already performing and/or had already recorded on Live at the Georgia Theatre.  Already Free is a clear departure from the band's previous work (even if they have been performing \\"Down Don't Bother Me\\" in live shows for a while). In my opinion, Already Free is not a step back from Songlines, just a step in a different direction ... like many of the band's past releases (compare 2002's Joyful Noise to 2003's Soul Serenade).  Already Free does sound more polished than Songlines, but I think it sounds retro more than mainstream or commercial, particularly when compared to \\"Revolution\\" on Songlines (the band's most commercial song to date).      If you're already a fan, I suggest that you forget Songlines, forget the Allman Brothers Band, and forget DTB's live shows ... just for a while ... and listen to Already Free on its own merit.  The more you listen to Already Free, the more it will grow on you.  In my case, Already Free grew from an album I \\"liked\\" (3-4 stars) to my favorite DTB studio album to date (5 stars).

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Okay, so I know the year is only just getting started, but Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino right out of the gates is already the first truly great film of 2009. Clint Eastwood is firmly at the helm of this top-notch drama as both director and star. Not only is he fully capable of convincing you he's still one mean, tough son-of-a-gun at almost 79 years of age, but he directs with such razor-sharp clarity and focus when many other directors half his age have only blurry, half-hearted visions of where their movies are going.<br /><br />I won't bother getting into covering the plot here this time around as other reviewers have already done a competent, commendable job of doing so. (I'll save that for the home dvd release, which I'll most certainly be buying!) I especially liked Eastwood's character of Walt Kowalski, as he is so gruff and cynical that he's actually comically endearing as a result. I kind of prefered to think of him as 'Dirty' Harry Callahan in retirement, or at least an extension. The gradually forming acceptance and bond between Walt and Thao as mentor and pupil really made the movie for me, and it's quite rewarding to watch.<br /><br />The only element about this movie I don't like is the notion and sense that it's Clint's goodbye to acting. There's something in the structure and general feeling of Gran Torino similar to The Hunter (1980), Steve McQueen's somewhat elegaic final film. Although this would be quite a fine note to end his illustrious acting career on, it's still sad to think that this could be the last time we see Eastwood's trademark grimaces of indignant rage at injustice or stupidity. Hopefully Eastwood's not quite finished with his work in FRONT of the camera just yet.<br /><br />This movie is fully deserving of its praise due to its excellent characterization and a climatic twist that was (in a good way) different than what I expected. I'm confident in declaring this Clint Eastwood's best movie of the past 15 years and I predict it will be remembered for years and years to come. Not to give anything away, but I felt the movie's ending and final scene in particular had a poignant, Brian's Song-like quality and feel to it, which welcomingly made it all the more bittersweet. Years from now, people will still be talking about this movie and remember it favorably as one of Eastwood's finest later performances. Superb drama. Be sure to see it.ears and years to come.

B001GKJ2DO|3.0|Being a long time ABBA fan, I really looked forward to watching this movie. From the previews I saw on TV, I thought it would be an excellent movie...and in many ways it is! First, let me elaborate on the not so good aspects of this movie:    1. The plot, I feel, is too simple. Basically, it is about a mother, played by Meryl Streep, who supports herself and her 20 year old daughter Sophie by running a hotel somewhere in Greece. Sophie is about to be married, but before she does, she wants to find out who her biological father is, so she invites 3 men that her mother was involved with way back in the day in order to determine this. Sophie feels that she will know her father on the spot, but rather, feels some connection to all of them. Even though this plot is quite emotional, I feel it falls short in the way it plays out. A more complex plot would have helped the movie.  2. The singing was mediocre and at times very disappointing. None of the actors in this movie could sing well. After some thinking, I concluded that maybe this was intentional, or at the very least, not a priority. In other words, perhaps the people who made this movie did not intend to get good singers, but ordinary people who felt inspired to sing.  3. The acting was at times awkward and non-flowing. I was not always convinced of genuine feeling by the actors and their dialogue.    Alright, now for the good aspects:    1. Wonderful scenery: wow, the scenery in this movie was breath-taking. Filmed in Greece, the water was pristine and blue, the beaches immaculate, and the hotel was a spectacle, full of architectural charm. I also loved the costumes that the actors wore. Whoever was in charge of wardrobe was a genius, as were the people who decorated the hotel and that lovely series of lights that led up that ridge to the church where the wedding took place.   2. Charming actors: I've alluded to awkward acting above, but I really got a sense that the actors really had a fun time making this movie.Perhaps it was more exciting to be a participant in this movie than an onlooker. There was an infectious sense of elation as the actors sang and danced and frolicked around, not a care in the world. Meryl Streep was comic with the caulking compound. The actress who played Sophie was very good at playing a slightly naive and innocent part. Perhaps her career will take off with this movie, as I thought her acting was the best.  3. Even though the singing wasn't stellar, the songs certainly were! Any fan of ABBA will easily recognize the plethora of ABBA's greatest songs. I also think that the songs were appropriately placed as the movie's events unfolded. It is good for the seasoned ABBA fan, as well as people who are new to ABBA.     Well, thus ends my review! Hope this review helps people who are eager to see this movie. I hope you all have a great day!    Denise C.

For the duration of each audio disc we felt we were involved with Juliet and the group of people who made up the Literary Society on Guernsey. A well written story that totally absords the reader.
031606792X|3.0|This book is nothing but the inevitable ending we all expected. While the plot is entertaining and it is not such a bad story, neither the writing nor the world depicted bring anything of use to literature in general or even the genre of vampires and mythology. Whereas the work of writers like J.K. Rowling or Tolkien imagined a whole new world in detail, hence enriching the genre of fiction and fantasy at large, Meyer does not really bring anything original to the genre but, rather, a very commercial formula that satisfies the mind the same way a standard Hollywood hit would. Her novels are not meant to challenge concepts or social rules but, instead, they support traditional notions and stereotypes all the way to the end, in a fairy tale fashion.  So, all in all, if you want to read something that will keep you interested the same way comfort food does (good, short and unhealthy) you will like the series. But if you are looking for something special, original, and challenging that brings new concepts and ideas into your life, then this is definitely not it and you are better off skipping these books.  On a personal note, I think Meyer's story is pretty immature and simplistic, with characters that seem unhealthily obsessed with love --a love with completely unjustified roots--, and once again recreates this fairy tale vision of the world that can only hinder young readers' minds instead of preparing them for the real world. Everyone likes a romantic story, but it does not have to be so completely idyllic that alienates you from reality. In fact, reality can be much better than that in its own imperfect way.  I hope this helps!

0385736002|1.0|Soulless. The author dishes out one magical wonder after another with little or no emotional involvement of the main characters and, therefore, the reader. There is no sense of mystery: everything is clear from page one, and abundantly explained each time in advance. After that, it's just a series of magical encounters, D&D style. While the author is describe as an 'expert on myth' on the back cover, he reads more like an expert in Google and Wikipedia searches. What a waste of (not that original) material. With one chapter of this, Meyer would have written an angsty 600 pages volume
0316017922|3.0|I read Gladwell's \\"Blink\\" and was not impressed. Now I've read \\"Outliers\\" and I am still not impressed with Gladwell's books, though I have enjoyed his column on occasion.<br /><br />  Gladwell has created an apparently profitable niche for himself. In \\"Outliers\\", Gladwell says he wants to lead us to an understanding of success.<br /><br />  He fails.<br /><br />  We get a mish-mash of disparate facts and then conclusions drawn without any real support. Want to excel at something? Practice 10,000 or more hours. The Beatles played 10,000 hours before they acheived popular success. Mozart practiced 10,000 hours before composing his first major work. Bill Gates spent 10,000 hours writing programs. And so on.<br /><br />  Likewise, you must be born at the right time. Gladwell for example takes the example of young student hockey players chosen for championship teams. The teams are stuffed with kids born in the early part of the year. Gladwell correctly concludes this is because at young ages, six extra months of development makes a big difference, so a 9 year old isn't as well developed as a 9.5 year old. But this foolish anomaly in a hocky program is not strong enough to support Gladwell's theory that this kind of \\"luck\\" underlies all success.<br /><br />  Anyone familiar with the story of Bill Gates will recognize that Gates' thousand of hours of programming didn't have as much to do with his success as Gates' ability to comprehend the impact of the microprocessor, his unrelenting aggressivness, his family connections which Gladwell entirely ignores and the many other factors that make Gates who and what he is.<br /><br />  Gladwell would have you believe that it was Gates' early exposure to computing that was responsible for the man's success. But Gladwell doesn't tell us the outcomes for the other people at Gates' school where the mother's club bought a terminal for the kids. Are they all software billionaires too?<br /><br />  Gladwell, on the whole, is an entertainer. Kind like a Robert Ripley of many years ago and his \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\\" with factoids such as that an ant can lift many times its own bodyweight. Like the late Carl Sagan, Gladwell is also a masterful self-promoter.<br /><br />  But Gladwell is not a scientist and what he offers in \\"Outliers\\" may be mildly entertaining, but it is not science - and, for that matter, his conclusions are far from fact.<br /><br />  \\"Outliers\\" is good as a light afternoon read, but despite the rave reviews from the A-list party crowd Gladwell hangs out with, it is not a very persuasive work. Just some more junk science.<br /><br />Jerryis \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\\" with factoids such as that an ant can lift many times its own bodyweight.

B001P1L606|5.0|The much awaited album by Antony's loyal following is finally here. I don't think any of us feared being disappointed and I can't imagine that many will be. Antony has not strayed far from what we have come to love since the first albums and ep's. There is a gentle sweep toward an even softer, gentler approach. Paired down a bit from prior releases, displaying individual instruments in ways we have not heard. Evolving but not moving further than most of us are ready for. There is still so much to lose ourselves in and Antony has touched our hearts again.     Hopefully as many as possible were able to see the recent performances with local philharmonics in selected cities. Modestly performing in silhouette with only a faint light on the face was as close to religion as many people have ever experienced. With 4 standing ovations from a crowd so diverse. From alternokids to the elderly, it was incredible to see such a group so united over an artist like Antony. And for those who don't know, he has a sense of humor that shows that he can laugh at himself and what many think are only eccentricities. At one point he shared an anecdote about the previous day's single rehearsal when he told the orchestra to pretend they were fish. And the absolute surprise and fun moment of the show was when the crowd stunningly realized he was singing Beyonce's \\"Crazy In Love\\".    A huge mistake that many make is that Antony's music is sadly lamenting something lost or a certain emptiness, but it is about lifting the spirit and being free of the conventions that stand in the way of loving ourselves and neighbors.    The only disappointment here is that with the preorder from Antony's website allowed an immediately free download entitled \\"My Lord My Love\\". I think that Amazon should have some way of rectifying this, unless it is to ultimately be released elsewhere, but for now I'm sure that those of us who preordered would appreciate having the bonus song. Although there is plenty to be grateful for, I personally don't want to miss out on a thing.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|The surprisingly sweet, witty Stranger Than Fiction poses questions about fate and sacrifice while playfully touching on literary topics, but if this were all this film was, it might not warrant five stars.

Although it's not clear why a man like Harold would be attracted to a woman like Ana, their chemistry makes the bizarre pairing work.  Queen Latifah as Eiffel's calm assistant Penny balances Thompson's character's trembling near-insanity.<br /><br />Despite the serious issues this film addresses, it is ultimately a comedy.

0679731725|5.0|This is a truly great book. After putting it down, that was the only thought in my head. I felt very lucky to have read it. It tells the story of a traditional English butler traveling across the countryside to rendezvous with his former head maid, now unhappily married. As he makes his way he reminisces about his former boss, Lord Darlington, for whom he still has the highest regard, despite the apparently unpopular opinion with which the rest of the world now views him, and other events that took place during that time. Among his recollected stories are those of the former head maid to whom he is traveling, Miss Kenton (or so she was known when unmarried and under his employ, and as he still refers to her in his memory); those of his father, a butler as well, some during his best years but most during old age; and those of Darlington and his political gatherings after the first world war, beginning with friendly, semi-formal discussions of the world's unfair treatment of their vanquished foe, Germany, and then branching into more clandestine meetings designed to play a greater part on the world's stage and to which many important international figures were party. Stevens, the protagonist, also muses frequently about what exactly makes a great butler and what exactly is the nature of dignity.<br /><br />I always found myself entertained when reading this, even during droll philosophizings in which the narrator engages, but the book is so unassuming, so almost mild in its Englishless, that when it presented itself in its full power it all the more took me by surprise. Ishiguro truly is a master craftsman, and once all the pieces were in place and the full picture was in view, I could feel its heartbreaking core reaching out to every event and thought, small or large, and doubling their emotional weight. Never before have I read something so intricate.<br /><br />Every thought and action of Stevens is presented in the reserved voice of the old English butler, and thus every whispered inner emotion is suppressed, every duty to and action of his boss is magnified in importance, and every encounter with the outside world in all its freedom of spirit is alienating. The latter actually leads to a number of comic situations, one being Stevens's confusion regarding jokes and banter and his attempts to participate in it when forced to by his new American boss and others along his travels. But it also leads to great sorrow, and this double sided coin, always on the edge of Stevens's consciousness, kept me engaged both intellectually and emotionally. And because Stevens has convinced himself to think only in this reserved voice, because it's the only way of thinking that he knows, it seems to make a lot of sense, albeit in a foreign way. However, as more of the picture becomes visible, as the reader gets a more detailed picture of Stevens's mind and soul, the true unassuming, quiet, heartbreaking weight of the entire story is inescapable.d inner emotion is suppressed, every duty to and action of his boss is magnified in importance, and every encounter with the outside world in all its freedom of spirit is alienating.

The film alternates between Harold's dilemma and that of chain-smoking novelist Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), the voice in Harold's head who is on a desperate quest to overcome writer's block.<br /><br />Not a single actor is miscast in this metafictive exploration of writing, character, motivation, self-sacrifice, and passion.  Although it's not clear why a man like Harold would be attracted to a woman like Ana, their chemistry makes the bizarre pairing work.  Queen Latifah as Eiffel's calm assistant Penny balances Thompson's character's trembling near-insanity.<br /><br />Except for BD Live, the extras are the same as those on the standard DVD version.  Although I'm not generally a fan of special features, a few are worth noting:  \\"Words on a Page,\\"  an interview with Helm and producer Lindsay Doran; and \\"Actors in Search of a Story,\\" directer Marc Forster's analysis of the role of character in the story.  Outtakes and deleted scenes are only marginally interesting.<br /><br />The most amazing part of this film is the comedic overtones despite the heavy issues it addresses.  The laugh-out-loud moments come one after another, and they serve to deepen our emotional involvement with the plot.  I expected so little of this film, and was rewarded with much more than I thought possible.<br /><br />For another humorous, though more difficult, film about the writing process and predestination, check out [[ASIN:B00005JLRE Adaptation (Superbit Collection)]].<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannenny balances Thompson's character's trembling near-insanity.

0553579908|2.0|I read the first novel in this series at the urging of a friend. It was ok, a bit violent for my tastes. I did like the plot twists and style, so I started reading this. The plot twists and style were still there, but I could not finish it. Frankly, the wanton and gleeful depictions of rape and violence were too much for me. I found it deeply disturbing, enough that I felt nauseated.     I guess it may be different if you are a man; I have yet to meet a woman who actually liked this book. My male friends speak enthusiastically about this series. Ugh. Even thinking about it now is making me queasy.
B001GQSY5U|4.0|Fanyboys aside, there is a big discrepancy in the quality of the Star Wars films directed by Lucas and the Star Wars films directed by others.  I give him all the credit in the world for the idea, but Lucas doesn't seem to be the best person to tell his own story.  I really enjoyed the Clone Wars 3D animated movie as well as the series to the point where I think it's superior to AT LEAST half of Episodes 1-6.  Episodes 4 (being superior) and episodes 5 and POSSIBLY 3 being the only ones that can even compete with EITHER of the animated Cartoon Network Clone Wars series.      The reason why this newest film and the two series are so good is because of the fact that the focus is on STORY and CHARACTER rather than spectacle or effects.  Hey, I like seeing \\"real people\\" onscreen too, but I give credit where credit is due.    I DO tip my hat to Lucas for many reasons, though.  First, he is confident enough with his brilliant original concept to let other talented people extend it to a degree that HE couldn't have even imagined. Not everyone is that humble.  Second, much of the technology in digital film making was pioneered by Lucas.  A lot of the early work in 3D animation and digital editing was pioneered by a division of LucasFilm that eventually became Pixar.  Nonlinear editing was also a brainchild of Lucasfilm in the form of EditDroid.  Nowadays, there are very few films that don't edit non-linearly or use some kind of effects work pioneered by Lucas' company (even if not by Lucas himself).  Lucas is a mediocre (at best) director, but is a GREAT producer and has some GREAT concepts.    The Clone Wars movie and two series are excellent and are not exclusively for kids (in almost EVERY other part of the world animation is not viewed as just for kids as it is in America). Wake up, folks, animation is just another form of film making, another tool to tell a story. No one would say that drawing in charcoals is \\"serious art\\", but \\"painting in pastels and oils is for kids!\\".  Great film making is in the generation and deft handling of CONTENT!
B000M341QE|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Jack Nicholson's hammy overacting marrs every scene he's in (though some people seem to like his scenery-chewing) but the movie is a spendidly-made crime thriller that conveys the perils of going undercover with a great soundtrack and more than a few suprises.

0198534469|5.0|This is the book I wish I had in college. I'm a huge proponent of emphasizing understanding over rigor -- math education is about the former, not the latter.    Prof. Needham's book is a wonderful journey through the context and background of ideas, along with examples and exercises to reinforce understanding. Seemingly magical formulas like Euler's Theorem (e^ix = cos(x) + isin(x)) just snap into place.    I'm only in the first chapter but and just amazed at the quality and depth. Ideas are discussed, but insights are worked for and not fed to you. I feel like I'm really learning the things I should have been taught. Just get this book!
1400096936|5.0|I purchased five of Don Winslow's novels at one time a few months ago, based on an Amazon reviewer's (Gary Griffin) recommendation, and I've not been disappointed in a single one of the books.  In fact, I've been amazed at the sheer brilliance of Winslow's creativity and writing style, confused at why it has taken me so long to find this remarkable author of suspense thrillers.  Having read The Dawn Patrol, The Winter of Frankie Machine, California Fire and Life, The Death and Life of Bobby Z, I finally decided to tackle The Power of the Dog, which is a long book (over five hundred pages in length).  I'd been putting it off for a few weeks because though I enjoyed Bobby Z, I'm not really into novels about Mexican and Columbian drug cartels, especially long ones that cover a thirty-year span of time and have a multitude of characters that the reader has to keep track of.  The book is also heavy in weight.  I mention that because I have to carry it on the bus with me when I go to work each weekday, and I usually end of having to stand each way with the book in my hand.  Well, I broke down and read the first twenty pages of The Power of the Dog and once again found myself hooked on a Winslow novel.  I couldn't put the sucker down, no matter how heavy it was.  I ended up reading the book in three days.  Not only was I entertained in a way that most readers can only dream about with a favorite author, but I also learned a lot about American's war on drugs and the billions of dollars that we've spent on a losing battle.  This is what great writing is supposed to do--entertain and educate and to hopefully make a reader think about the things that were discussed within the novel.<br /><br />It's 1975 and Art Keller has come out of Vietnam and the C.I.A. to join the D.E.A. in its new war against drugs, specifically the drugs coming out of Mexico and into the United States.  He's young and ambitious and wants to make a big splash career wise, more so since his boss and team members pretty much ignore him because of his background in the intelligence field.  Being half Mexican, however, Keller does what his other team members are unable to do and quickly works his way into the trust of the two young Barrera brothers, Adan and Raul, and through them, their uncle Tio (Miguel Angel Barrera, who works for the State Police and wants to be the only drug distributor in Mexico.  Tio immediately recognizes Art's ambition to advance his career and uses the D.E.A. agent to rid himself of his competition, killing the men and their entire families in one massive wave of death.  Art Keller's career takes a giant leap, but it has its price.  Once Tio and his nephews become the drug lords of Mexico, Art realizes his mistake and soon has to focus his attention on putting them behind bars.  Art will do whatever it takes to put the Barrera clan away and it eventually causes the death of not only one his agents, who's tortured for information that he doesn't have, but also the death of a woman who's head is cut off and her two children thrown off a seven-hundred foot bridge to their deaths as a lesson to her drug-dealing husband, the death of a Catholic priest, who desires only to help the poor of Mexico and to do God's work, and countless others before the novel is finally finished.  Art will also have to deal with the Italian Mafia, an Irish stone-cold killer, and a prostitute named Nora, in order to bring down the Barrera family, and his own life will never be quite the same as he looses his family and slowly becomes what he hates the most.<br /><br />The Power of the Dog is a novel that never lets up and keeps the reader glued to each page with the behind-the-scenes drama that goes on between the United States and Mexico, not to mention Central America and Columbia, and the power of the American dollar because it's all about money in the end.  The reader also has to face the horror and violence that the United States helped to create as the drug cartelsstruggle for their very survival.  This is a novel of such intensity that it will leave you breathless and shocked when the last page is reached.  It will also give you a bitter look at what actually goes on behind closed doors and how the lives of the common man mean absolutely nothing to those in power.  It doesn't matter how many women and children have to die in order to keep the drugs flowing into the United States and the money flowing back into Mexico.  Though this is a work of fiction, the story definitely gave me a new outlook on the United States government and the effect it has on other countries, always dangling the all-American dollar above their heads in an effort to get what it wants.<br /><br />Don Winslow has written a book of such massive scope, detail, and insight, that it does for thrillers what Stephen King's The Stand did for the horror genre.  This is a novel that will certainly entertain, but it's also one that will open your eyes and enable you to see more clearly the terrible cost of drugs in both money and human lives, and what our country is capable of doing when it thinks it's in the right.  At the end of the day, all of us will have blood on our hands.  An extremely powerful novel that will leave you mesmerized by this author's capability and utterly addicted to everything he writes.  Highly recommended!!!or their very survival.  This is a novel of such intensity that it will leave you breathless and shocked when the last page is reached.

B00003CXC6|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Rashomon's framing scenes don't work too well (especially the ending ones) and the message is diluted somewhat by the use of a medium to tell one of the stories, but Rashomon is still interesting and worthy of a look.

B000Q67876|5.0|I had not seen this movie in 15 years.  As most know, it is one of the true great movies of all time.  And now this movie is put on a blu ray package that is truly worthy of this movie.<br /><br />Excellent blu ray, looks and sounds fantastic.  And the extras and the packaging is just top notch.  A must for any movie buff.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|To describe this move as a horror movie is to miss the primary themes underlying it.  I'll try to limit repeating what others have said about its background.  Oskar lives in a stark, lonely world where nobody seems able or willing to take the time to understand the pain caused him by cruel classmates at school.  His parents display affection but remain distant, too busy with their own worries.  Oskar senses this and does not confide in either parent.  He has nobody, no one to feel his pain.  Until Eli.    Like Oskar, Eli holds a dark secret of her own.  She must kill to survive, yet there is a very human side to her that does not delight in inflicting pain. Nobody, not even the one person who knows her secret, understands the conflicts in her heart, her desire not to be cruel combined with the need to kill in order to live.  Eli's affection for Oskar comes through in small yet significant gestures that viewers may not realize until after the movie.  At one point, she even risks her existence to show Oskar who she is and that she can be vulnerable.  Like Oskar and even more so, Eli is alone to deal with these unsolvable conflicts.      Tomas Alfredson brilliantly captures the barren, emotional desert in which Oskar and Eli live.  The direction is focused but restrained.  The excellent musical score complemented the movie well.  Alfredson draws the viewer into this lonely world where two people find in each other a strength, a hope and discover that perhaps their world is not as lonely as they had once believed it to be.    Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson are brilliant in their acting debuts.  Both bring an innocence and refreshing simplicity that make the complex roles they play easily believable.  It's hard to imagine anyone else in these roles and while I'm not opposed to the remake being made in the US, my expectations are minimal, so much so that I don't plan on seeing it unless the reviews are stellar.  I can't see any remake being as good as Alfredson's original.  This movie is that good.  Big budget doesn't equate to excellence.      Thanks to the brilliant directing and acting, anyone who has struggled with loneliness will find much to identify with in this movie.  It simply captures you.  The themes in this move are like still water.  They run deep and I expect to be thinking of the themes for some time.  Like the book and musical score, this wonderful movie goes into my collection when the DVD is released.  This movie is destined to become a classic, an underappreciated gem.    IMPORTANT EDIT!!!!!  The DVD release is NOT THE SAME FILM I WATCHED IN THE THEATER.  Magnet ruined it with changes to the subtitles and the musical score seems  softer at least to me.  Don't waste your money until Magnet changes the LOUSY subtitles.  Even better yet, get a copy from a region outside North America that wasn't ruined by Magnet's bonehead revisions!  Just be sure that you have a player that can play other region coded DVDs.
B000M4RG42|2.0|The Bottom Line:    A failure on almost every level, Flags of Our Fathers is a slow, poorly-acted, stiffly-directed and leaden drama/war-film that hammers the viewer over the head with its \\"message\\" at every opportunity and *actually* ends with a tearful deathbed scene in which a son reconnects with his father; please watch the far superior Letters From Iwo Jima (or basically anything else) before you watch this overwraught corn.

B000EBD9TY|4.0|The seamy, hot nights of New Orleans with the rattle trap streetcar thundering along outside the apartment blocks represent the superb setting for this tight, ensemble class to deliver their superb perfomances.<br /><br />The film resembles the stage play, with the ensemble cast acting out a drama of passion and class, that encompasses the great human themes of frailty and facade.<br /><br />Marlon Brando is dynamite in his famous role as the brutish, alpha male Stanley which had women fainting in cinemas in the 1950s, and ever since.<br /><br />A must see.
B00005JLWN|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Equilibrium is the type of movie I would have loved as a 13 year-old and is thus recommended to anyone who likes seeing stuff blown up/shot/cut in half/otherwise murdered, but for people who require a little more it's a noisy shoot-em-up which jettisons its ideas in favor of pyrotechnics.
B000000XB9|5.0|I'm 25 years old. Ever since i can remember, i grew up listening through this whole record, as my father would play it often. Today we still listen to it, and it's one of the few cds i never get tired of.<br /><br />Classic.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This film's impact on media is so far reaching that it is a must see on that basis alone. It sets the bar and gives inspiration for writing, cinematography, composition, and editing for the creatively inclined. If you've got more than a passing interest in movies, you should see this film.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|Because I watched Repo! The Genetic Opera recently, I felt like watching Grease. It had been a long time since I watched it. I remember in my Sophomore year in high school 3 years ago, we watched this and the teacher made it a better experience. It has a really good storyline, awesome actors, awesome songs, and recreates the classic look of the 50's! Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsen meet during summer break at the beach. She thinks she has to go back to Austraila, but doesn't want to because she has fallen in love with Danny. On the first day of school, Sandy comes to Rydell High School where Danny goes. He is excited to see her, but can't let his T-Bird buddies know, so he plays it cool and blows her off, but he really feels bad about it. Throughout the movie, Danny tries to win back her love. I highly recommend GREASE!!!
031606792X|1.0|I was so anxious to read this book because I loved the first 3. And I started off really liking this one. But when I got to the part where Jacob imprinted on Bella's baby, it made me so sick and mad! Jacob was so dependent on Bella, he wouldn't leave Bella alone even after she married Edward and had his baby! He is disgusting! And then for Bella, Edward and his family to allow Jacob to hang around while Bella was in labor and then after, that made me mad too. I was so dissapointed in this book, I almost didn't finish it.

B000022TSY|4.0|Its no use trying to explain the value of this movie to people who werent alive at that time. No need to defend it, either. Young people of any generation usually think they know everything anyway, so why bother. But there was a time before the internet and cell phones, and easy rider is a strong youth statement from such a time. The movie making itself might seem dated, but the impulse behind this film is real in a way that 10 Fast and Furious sequels cant match. And this movie will always be a snapshot of rebellion; from the real life pot smoking done on camera throughout the movie, to an acid tripping Peter Fonda hating his mother out loud in the graveyard sequence (his real mother took her own life when he was a boy.) Theres plenty to be critical about in easy rider from a technical standpoint, but as a low budget attempt at capturing a larger cultural mood of rebellion at that moment, it does quite well. You had to be there.
B000002VQQ|4.0|Originally released in 1975, as this was the proto-punk princess's first solo effort. I haven't heard this title in ages. Nice to hear on CD reissue. Tunes I remember playing (when I was in the mood) numerous times enough to wear the vinyl copy out were her cover of Van Morrison's \\"Gloria\\", the nine-minute \\"Birdland\\", the inspiring \\"Kimberly\\", the lp's other nine-minute epic \\"Land: Horses / Land Of A Thousand Dances\\" + this disc's added bonus cut, her almost-mutated cover of the Who's \\"My Generation\\". Glad to know Patti Smith is still active today. Recommended.
B001KW0C96|5.0|It may just have been the fact that Pacino and DeNiro were together once again in a movie, but I truly loved this movie. My wife actually fell asleep in one of the slower parts, so I ended up watching the entire movie twice, once I played it over again for her enjoyment. But like so many others that reviewed this flick, she didn't enjoy it at all. I knew it must have had poor rating, especially when I rented it through NetFlix as a Blu-ray release and I didn't have any wait at all to receive it. I also might be the only one that really liked the little twist at the end. Now, I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so you'll just have to see it for yourself. I gave it the full FIVE STARS.

Exhausting research that has gone into this book and Daniel narration is fascinating. He richly deserves that Pulitzer Prize. This book first came out in the early 90's but probably has more relevance today. I have a copy signed by the author and it is a \\"Prize\\" I will always cherish
B0014I4KIK|1.0|A new artist needs to have a first album that is full of hits not filler.  Two of the tracks are enjoyable, the rest I could do without.  It makes me long for the days of the 45.  She needs to not leave the studio until she can fill an album with quality work.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I was touched by this documentary.  Not many people in America can make a movie like this - exposing the deplorable condition of our healthcare system.  When the system is operated by \\"for profit\\" companies, they are obviously going to look at the bottom line first -- patients are not their #1 consideration.  Fighting HMO is like fighting with Goliath.  People die trying. Some just give up.  If you renovate your house, you can get estimate of your total cost.  Why can't we have the same for the health care? Even for a minor surgery, the  bills keep coming in -- one after another.  You never know when it'll stop!<br /><br />I read some of the negative reviews.  Leftist propaganda?  Huh...?  These writers obviously never experienced the joy of going through the HMO system.  How lucky they are.  I hope they don't wait until they, or someone from their family, get seriously ill before realizing what Michael Moore was trying to say -- that our healthcare system is NOT working!  No one should have to sell their house to pay for their health care, nor should any one be denied a visit to the hospital because it was not part of the \\"in-network\\" of the HMO listing.<br /><br />Michael Moore is an American hero.  He attacks the issue on hand with gusto - God bless him!  Every American deserves the right to have the best possible health care.  For those people who pooh-poohed Moore's documentary, please go and make sure your elderly parents are exercising and eating right, because elder-care is pot-of-gold for the drug & healthcare industries.
B000VHKFU2|5.0|For those that enjoy the ease and price point of the Amazon MP3 downloads, please be wary of the current MP3 download for Karajan/BPO Mahler 9 with the split files within each movement.  I downloaded the Amazon MP3 version and was disappointed with the clear gaps within each movement in particular the 3rd Movement (tracks 1-7 on disc 2).  Even with recombining/reimporting the MP3 files the gap is still annoying and noticeable.  What is strange is that other Deutsche Grammophon MP3 albums are perfectly fine when burned or reimported gapless, but not this one.     This is by far my favorite Mahler 9th recording, and now that I have the CD version imported gapless, I couldn't be happier. 5 Stars for the CD.  2 Stars for this MP3 version.     Bottom line - buy the CD for this version and skip the MP3.

0385338082|3.0|This is just my second experience with chick lit.  If they're all like this, I won't be trying too many more.  One reviewer said it was a roller-coaster ride, and I agree ... though the entire second half the book seemed pretty low.    At first I was tickled with Emma and her silly, funny thoughts.  Her self-doubt was endearing.  Her secrets were so charming.  And the mysterious man?  Oh, I wanted to know more!  But then, once she made an extremely abrupt decision involving her boyfriend, the rest of the book lacked not only credibility but also humor and interest.  I laughed at loud at the beginning, yet I had to search hard for anything entertaining after mid-way through.  What a let-down!  At least it was a quick read, and a not-altogether unpleasant one at that.

B001HN697C|5.0|I so loved another powerful woman having a key role in an Underworld movie!<br />It was also ultimately exciting to see how Lucien became what you saw of him in the first movie. My favourite character is Lucien and it is nice to see the Lycan side of the story--with being a lifetime vampire person, the Lycans really turned my head with these movies.<br />Will see it again in the theater and definitely purchase when it comes out on DVD!
B00005CDNK|4.0|It's been said many times already that this album differs from your typical Abba but that doesn't make it inferior in any way.  Quite the opposite.  This is one of their most creative works almost exclusively motivated by their crumbling marriages and their fading interest in the world stage.  Sad and dark in places, the creativity never falters and as the last notes die away, you feel sad that such a fantastic talent such as Abba had to put their personal torments to music and call it quits.  I will always remember them as one of the best with never a bad song.  Thank you for the music!
B00005ASHM|5.0|In 1966, when it was released, this album didn't sell as well as previous Beach Boys albums.  I don't know why.  I thought it was fantastic.  Now it's regarded as a critical success!  Well, I guess better late than never.  The subject matter is mostly boy-girl relationships - \\"Sloop John B\\" is a notable exception - with a little venturing into the territory of introspection.  But the music!  The melodies and instrumentation rival the music of The Beatles' \\"Rubber Soul\\" in variety and inventiveness; and like those songs, these manage to display that genius in the standard (then) 3-minute track.  \\"God Only Knows\\" is one of the most beautiful ballads I have ever heard, and I'm not saying that because of the religious reference, because I am an agnostic.  \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" sounds like a more typical Beach Boys record, but the lyrical content was daring enough to get it banned on some radio stations.  \\"Caroline No\\" is gorgeous, the lyrics and the music.  This CD gives it all to you in both mono and stereo.  Mono may be OK for sentimental reasons, but I recommend the stereo (Tracks 15-27) for sheer pleasure.  Too bad that Brian Wilson suffered a mental decline after this album.  Who knows what he might have produced?
B0011V9XT6|5.0|A must-have blu-ray title! Excellent audio and video with an almost complete line-up of songs from Beyonc&eacute;.

B000P12LWY|5.0|It's so exciting to have a series of this caliber to watch and to look forward to (can't wait until April 09 for the new season!). I starting watching the Tudors mid season and was hooked. I ordered the previous episodes just to have the pleasure of catching up. The acting is superb - the sets are lush. A good deal of the history that we know is portrayed accurately....but of course, there is dramatic license, the players are no doubtedly more beautiful and striking than their actual historical counterparts.....and King Henry VIII was NEVER this sexy. LOVE THIS SHOW.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|This is a sweet, romantic film that will make you feel good inside.  The acting is all great, with all of the characters ringing very true.  My one complaint is that I could tell at times that the two lead actors are straight in real life. They seemed uncomfortable in some of the kissing scenes and like they couldn't wait to get it over with.  That said, it's a very enjoyable story about real people, real lives and real love.  The two leads are appealing and have great chemistry. Tina Holmes is a terrific actress and does a great job as the unlikeable, self centered mother who doesn't much care about her kid.  Though at the end, she also does a good job of showing the character as conflicted and sad, and lets a little of her \\"mom\\" side through.  What really grabbed me about this film is that it isn't some gimmicky film, or something about incredible events that would never happen in real life. It's simply about people falling in love and making the best of their situations.  Very romantic and endearing, I wanted to know these characters.
0452284392|5.0|Albert-L&aacute;szl&oacute; Barab&aacute;si is a renowned scientist who has brought into the spotlight the science of networks, and at the same time he is a great writer who describes scientific discoveries in a way that make them sound like detective stories.<br /><br />In Linked, Albert-L&aacute;szl&oacute; Barab&aacute;si gives us an introduction to the fascinating world of networks and complexity. He discusses the scientific models that shaped our understanding of networks, ranging from early random network theory of Erd&ouml;s and R&eacute;nyi to scale-free networks, a discovery that can be attributed to the author himself. Along with the scientific models, we learn about the attributes of networks, such as small world properties, clustering, power law distribution, preferential attachment, and fitness model.<br /><br />Intertwined with the network models and properties, the author discusses the practical applications of these theories. This hugely interdisciplinary field consists of physics, mathematics, biology, computer science, sociology, warfare, business and many other areas. It is eye-opening to see how networks underlie almost every area of our everyday life and how the understanding of networks can give us additional insight into everyday experiences. Some specific examples discussed in the book are the financial crisis of 1997, the September 11 attacks, spreading of AIDS, adoption of product innovations, and cancer research.<br /><br />The powerful content of Linked is wonderfully packaged in a narrative consisting of intertwined plots, biographies, and humor which make the book an excellent read. We can feel the author's passion for the topic and are left with an inspiration and a better understanding of our networked reality.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is an excellent film about how one person can indeed make a difference in the world.  William Wilberforce believed God wanted to use him to abolish slavery in England...and though it cost him personal health and acclaim, he persevered for over 15 years.  A good supplement to the history account that some kids study in high school. I highly recommend it.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our 10-year old can understand how to play, yet the adults are never bored.  Everyone in the family has won at least one game.  It does take a good 10 minutes to understand the game at first - just set up the board following the \\"beginner\\" layout.  The game lasts 60 to 90 minutes (somehow always the longer time when it's almost bed time!)  We love this game and our boys can't wait to get the expansion packs.    The game board is different every game becuase you can rearrange the tiles that form the \\"island.\\"  Unfortunately, the board is sometimes a little annoying to set up because the edge pieces make a very tight fit around the \\"island.\\"  Pieces sometimes don't want to fit.
B00009V7T2|3.0|There is absolutely nothing normal about The Mars Volta. You can tell by the name of the album, the cover of the album, and even the name of the band that they are in no way ordinary. When I first heard this album I didn't understand it at all. None of the words they were saying made any sense to me and I thought they were just throwing around big words for fun. But after some research, I learned that the lyrics are telling the story of Cerpin Taxt, who tries to kill himself by overdosing on a mixture of morphine and rat poison. The attempt lands him in a week long coma during which he experiences visions of humanity and his own psyche. Upon waking, he is dissatisfied with the real world and jumps to his death. The story is said to be based on the death of artist Julio Venegas, who was a friend of the band. Despite it being one of the creepiest things I've ever heard, it's also beautiful in a way, especially the song \\"Televators.\\" At this point in the album, Cerpin has taken his own life. Overall, it's pretty hard to get into, as most of the songs are around 7 minutes long (or 12 in the case of \\"Cicatriz ESP\\"). But the untamed guitars on songs like \\"This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed\\" and \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\" will keep the listener on edge.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|One of the best of the classic MGM musicals, Meet Me In St. Louis brings that America we all wish existed to life in more ways than one.  Judy Garland is at her best and it shows.  Better than Royal Wedding not as good as Singing in the Rain, MMISL is well worth owning.  Do yourself a favor, experience this great film at least once a year, you'll be glad you did.
1600243916|5.0|I was so impressed with his other books, The Tipping Point and Blink! that I was delighted to see this one come out.  It did not disappoint!  He touches on subjects that we all know and have always had gut instincts about, but felt it too taboo to even formulate the thought process fully.  He has such a gentle and pragmatic way about him; you can hear the honesty and integrity with which he conducts and memorializes his studies.  It is a tribute to the respect afforded him that Malcolm was able to get the stories behind the stories of these successful people we all admire so.  I have and do enthusiastically recommend it to anyone with even a glimmer of curiosity about undertanding humanity.
B000UR9QIK|1.0|I was sucked in!!!!! This is NOT the Dawn of the Dead with Ving and cast. It is the original that at the best can barely rate a 1.I was totally disappointed when I started the movie. I couldn't possibly believe that i was caught off guard and threw away good money for such a movie of this type. Blu-ray quality, my backyard!I have seen many standard dvd's and vhs tapes that can make the viewing of this movie look like dust.As for Romero's Classics, this was definitely not his best work. I'd take Thriller anytime over this zombie movie. So be warned you can do better than this.

B00005JPLW|3.0|The REAL Spartans at the REAL battle of Thermopylae personified by proxy the eternal principled struggle between art and commerce faced by the makers of this film.  Tough decisions confront those with creative control over art used in furtherance of big business.  In the case of 300, the filmmakers forfeited a golden opportunity to underscore the Spartans' unfailing discipline and teamwork - the REAL reasons for their valiant showing at Thermopylae.  Succumbing to the overwhelming hordes of bottom-line commerce, they chose instead to pander to the market for showy displays of individual martial prowess.  In the REAL battle of Thermopylae, the Spartans would have been forced into this fighting mode only in the final hours of the third day as the flanking force swung in behind them after navigating the key mountain pass around the hot gates.  Had the filmmakers opted instead for the courageous pathway of historicity, they could have achieved a cinematic spectacle beyond imagining by depicting the REAL Spartan battle arrays and the magnificent coordinated action that made them work in the face of a both numerically and technically superior force.<br /><br />The filmmakers also reversed a bit of history with the depiction of Leonidas' youthful rite of passage, pitting him shivering in his skivvies at odds with a Dire Wolf in the mountain wilderness outside of ancient Sparta.  According to the corresponding History Channel episode, it was actually Xerces - Leonidas' rival at Thermopylae - who was pitted in his youth against a wild animal to ensure that only self-reliant and sufficently fierce contenders would ultimately ascend to the throne of the Persian Empire.<br /><br />I would also take issue with the cookie-cutter physiques that only modern gym equipment or theatrical prosthetics can produce.  The real Spartans would have developed shoulders of iron after years of training with those heavy spears and shields but otherwise average athletic builds would have been more realistic and would also have sorted better with an emphasis on the raw toughness, the relentless teamwork and the intellectual sophistication that made the Spartans unique in the ancient world.  Not to mention, Xerces' forces would have made hamburger out of hoplites without armor, and the Spartans had the best in the world at the time.  Why not show them in their armor and make up for the reduced superhero effect with a better depiction of their desperate struggle, devilish coordinated tactics, unwavering discipline in the face of certain death and indomitable spirit?<br /><br />Having long since begun using my Kindle [[ASIN:B000FI73MA Kindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading Device]], I started my reading at the very beginning of Western history with titles such as: [[ASIN:B00175H7IA THE HISTORIES --- UPDATED w/LINKED TOC]] by Herodotus - the Horse's mouth on subjects like the Spartans at Thermopylae.<br /><br />All that having been said, I will note in conclusion that 300, standing alone as a gesamtkunstwerk on its own polished merits against the howling hordes of nit-picking history buffs, truly rocks.would also have sorted better with an emphasis on the raw toughness, the relentless teamwork and the intellectual sophistication that made the Spartans unique in the ancient world.

1416594884|3.0|Having successfully put the Cold War to rest, John le Carre has now turned his attention to the War on Terror.  In many ways it is an interesting book; in others it is unsatisfactory.  Well-written as one would expect of this author, it really skirts the issue of Muslim militancy and terrorist acts.  It is more symbolic than a penetrating insight into the subject, as has been previously demonstrated in his espionage fiction.<br /><br />The characters are wooden puppets, symbols in a preconceived plot.  There is a has-been banker, an idealistic young female lawyer, a Muslim illegal from Chechnya who escaped prison and torture in Russia and Turkey by way of Sweden and Denmark, and all kinds of representatives of German, British and American intelligence services: all playing a role in a drama that is only barely explained.<br /><br />The story takes place in Hamburg, the city from which (a) the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers was plotted and (b) at least one mastermind left for New York City.  The setting is selected to demonstrate that steps must be taken to counteract acts of terrorism.  But, however harsh these steps may or not be and whether or not they are necessary, the novel addresses the problem in a perfunctory manner.  Not up to the usual le Carre standards, but a fairly good read nevertheless.
0439023483|5.0|I began this book as \\"before bed reading.\\"  It was recommended by Stephenie Meyer's on her website.  I had just finished reading the Twilight series and didn't think I'd find a book that would sweep me away like they had.  WOW WAS I WRONG.    For the first few nights I was able to stop reading to go to sleep.  But once the games began, thank goodness it was the weekend, because I could not put down the book.  Even when I did, I found myself thinking about the characters and trying to plot out what I thought was going to happen next.  I finally fell asleep Saturday night, only because I could not hold my eyes open any longer.      I was woken by my husband as he left for work.  I tried to fall back to sleep, but the book consumed my thoughts.  So, at 6:15am Sunday morning, I flipped on the light and didn't stop reading until I finished the book.  Now I can't wait for the second...and third for that matter!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|It's such a kick blu-ray is becoming so affordable, and Serenity was one of my first notices for br movies. I love all things Firefly (blu-ray there was an improvement) so Serenity was a no brainer. The lovely story that completed the wrongly-left-hanging Firefly series is a masterpiece in Sci Fi. The original premise was such a kick, and the movie continues, but also gets pretty serious sci-fi intense. Love all things Nathan Fillion now, and watch Serenity over and over and over..... Never get tired of it.
B001LRJH0U|3.0|Appaloosa is a 'modern era' Western, careful to avoid the pitfalls of cliche by offering well developed characters and avoiding predictable plot lines and devices. It mostly succeeds in the originality department, but sadly is derailed by a wandering plot line and unnecessary length.<br /><br />The strongest part of the film (and the reason to rent or buy it) is the interplay between the two protagonists Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen). In an interesting twist on the gun-hand for hire genre of westerns, they are instead lawmen for hire, taken on by the town of Appaloosa to avenge the killing of their town marshal. Ed Harris is very believable as Cole, an iron-hard gunman who reads Emerson, struggles with his vocabulary, and values his friendship with his longtime partner Everett above all else. In a refreshingly welcome divergence from the 'girl breaks up the friendship' storyline, Cole accepts his friends word on an important matter with calm sincerity. Mortensen provides a generally excellent performance, but his voice overs at the beginning and end of the film feel flat.<br /><br />The gunfights in the film are short, violent, and historically accurate. Particularly the cross-draw stance of Hitch, who turns his body to the side to give the smallest target possible. There is a believability to them that rivals OPEN RANGE's gun battles.<br /><br />The real problem with the film is its dramatic pacing. Overlong and even plodding, the story builds to several mini climaxes all of which have conclusions that lack pop. There is no real ultimate climax, and the ending of the film is perplexing in its intended message. The film would have benefited from losing 20-30 minutes of length and several of the unnecessary middle scenes that didn't add much to the story.<br /><br />Art direction in the film is fairly good, and includes welcome details like the lighter skin tone of the portion of Morensen's forehead protected by his hat, the length and weight of the impressive 8-gauge shotgun he carries, and his period accurate haircuts. Less well detailed are the western landscapes which include the obligatory horses crossing rivers, steam train, and sun sets, none of which really feel exceptional, and in the DVD release, simply don't look good from a film quality standpoint. The colors are muted, and the western landscape is never given much scale, except in a handful of shots.<br /><br />The DVD release is disappointing. The Dolby Digital soundtrack is also very poor with the voices from the center channel sounding muffled. Either they didn't use ADR (Automatic Dialogue Replacement) technology or the the sound was recorded at a low quality bit rate, leaving everything sounding flat on higher quality speakers. Only in a few scenes is 5.1 sound really used to dramatic effect. Also, the transfer looks muted and does not upscale well at all to 1080p. Colors are very bland and drab looking, and the darker scenes show a significant amount of lost detail. I would really like to get the Blue Ray for comparison to see if the picture quality problem was with the DVD transfer or the original film stock.<br /><br />Overall Appaloosa is not an excellent film, but the characters and acting make it very watchable. Not as well made as [[ASIN:B0000TANUI Open Range]] nor an eye-candy extravaganza like [[ASIN:B000XR9L50 3:10 to Yuma]], it is still well worth watching, and worth buying if you're a particular fan of westerns.<br /><br />3/5 Stars for the film. 1.5/5 Stars for the DVD transfer.ge shotgun he carries, and his period accurate haircuts.

0525951113|5.0|I've never really been big into reading.  I used cliff notes to get through high school and college lit classes and even lost patience reading those. Darn that ADHD!  But being the tech geek that I am, I heard a about this book and the plot intrigued me, so I figured I'd give it a try.  I assumed I'd probably lose interest about 1/4 of the way through the book and put it down.  But rather I read the entire thing in less than 48 hours.  The plot was always going somewhere.  There weren't any chapters I felt, could have been left out.  Every paragraph seemed just as important as the preceding one.      But more than that, I liked how he explained the technology being used turning things into just some fiction story, into something potentially realistic.  He even went as far to give specifics of the tools and methods used such as DDoS, SQL Injections, and Brute Force attacks to illustrate how things were accomplished.     Daniel Suarez's thriller was exciting enough to keep this ADHD, analytical tech geek wondering what happens next, and for that I give it an A+.  Well done!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Limitless stars; if any rating scale would allow it!  A good friend with discriminating taste referred me to the soundtrack and movie.  Absolutely amazing!  It accomplishes what few soundtracks/albums ever have in that it not only blows you away the first time you hear it, but it also grows on you over time/repeated listening.  (The genius in the depth and continuity became strikingly apparent over time.)      The soundtrack, like the movie, is the epitamy of bittersweet.  It makes you cry, but doesn't make you sad.  It says everything (really a global message) without saying anything in particular.  Meaning is especially enhanced after viewing the movie.      If you love music, I strongly recommend the purchase of both.  Unique, striking, full of heart, and delicately honest, you won't regret it.
B001NB6IN8|5.0|Ever since the success of \\"From Under The Cork Tree,\\" Fall Out Boy has moved far away from their pop/punk roots. But instead of the move to another zip code we saw in \\"Infinity on High,\\" we have now moved to another country. Sure, we still have pure FOB in \\"I Don't Care,\\" \\"America's Suitehearts,\\" and the profanity-laced \\"27.\\" which will be sure to please any fan. But then there's the highlight in \\"What A Catch, Donnie\\" which strikes something magical, that's totally out of character for the band, with a catchy ballad tune, soaring chorus, emotional lyrics, a great assortment of guests, and a show-stopping closing to the song. It's epic for sure, certainly awesome, and no doubt the band's best song. Not to mention one of the most surprising and top 20 songs of 2008.<br /><br />Other tracks great tracks include \\"Disloyal Order of The Water Buffaloes,\\" \\"She's My Winona,\\" \\"Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet,\\" \\"Coffee's For Closers,\\" \\"Tiffany Blews,\\" \\"20 Dollar Nose Bleed,\\" and rest be sured, FOB isn't laying off on the crazy/long song titles anytime soon.<br /><br />Overall, unlike the rest of the band's albums this rocks from start to finish, never remotely taking itself too seriously. Sure, Patrick Stump seems to have missed the memo, because he's more serious than ever, but that's part of what makes it so great. For FOB fans, modern rock fans, rock fans, arena rock fans, and fans of original and fun music. It may shock, but it'll be because it's so surprisingly good. By far Fall Out Boy's best album.
B001F12J48|1.0|Polar Express is a brilliant film, The Blue-Ray Dvd is perfect...but I thought the new 3-D version must be equal if not better...how wrong.  After the fantastic 3-D version of Journey To The Centre Of The Earth...the best I have ever seen...You would think Warner Bros would at least equal the process. It is cheap and nasty, plus it will give you a bad head after just 5 minutes. Stick with the Blue -Ray.
B001FOPODS|1.0|While the stop action is great this takes major liberties with the story as well as down plays the music that sets this story apart.  Someone decided that being PC is more important than following the story.  The hunters are bad, the wolf goes free, and Sasha the duck never comes back.  What a huge disappointment -- if you know the story don't bother with this version.
B000RSKD6G|5.0|Amazon suggested this book for me because I had ordered the Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings books online and it said they were similar. It was not what I was expecting at all but it was so much better. This book did a great job balancing between action and storyline. The action gets your heart beating. The story of Kvothe hits a spot, and it leaves you needing the 2nd and 3rd books to come out.       As for being related to Harry Potter and LOTR, I would say it is a blend of the two. It is set in a time much more like LOTR. The writing is more adult than Harry Potter but it doesn't get boring like LOTR does at some points. There is also a \\"magical\\" element in the story that leads to some very interesting plot twists. Overall, it is probably one of the best books I have ever read, and I will read this trilogy over and over again.
0739321005|5.0|This book, audio, read by new President Obama, points out his longing to be connected with his black background and the father he barely knew.  He was raised as a white person, in a white person's family, however in a black body.  His search for reconciliation and identification is touching.  His trip to Africa to meet his father's family was very interesting and he shares deep feelings and thoughts with the reader.  I would definitely recommend this book as well as the Audacity of Hope to anyone interested in knowing our new President from the inside, his plans, his thoughts, for himself and our country.

Being a more traditionalist in music, I wasn't sure what I'd think of the CD -- but I listened and I fell in love. I absolutely love the energy and the virtuosity of the players in this orchestra. It rivals the best of the Karajan recordings in their attention to detail and true *musical* understanding of the pieces. A must have for everyone, I love this disc :)

B000QXDED6|4.0|The key of Zack Zinder's epic style of film was to take the action event and turn it into a mythology... He wanted to get to the essence of the Spartans, and to show us the story of a handful of soldiers willing to risk all for a larger western concept of freedom and liberty...<br /><br />\\"300\\" is an interpretation of a complex historical event, the collision of cultures that continues to this day... Spartan warriors and Persian soldiers were probably the most extreme cultures of that moment...<br /><br />They were interesting elements of truth in Zinder's movie: The Spartans were not like the Athenians... They lived under more barbaric rules... Every Spartan was a soldier... They fight as a specialized unit (\\"That's the source of our strength!\\"). Once they get this right group of iron, brass and muscles they become almost undefeatable (\\"Today no Spartans die!\\").<br /><br />If you're a Spartan citizen you're a soldier (\\"Spartans! What is your profession?\\"), you're a pure warrior struggling for justice and for what you believe is true... The Spartans remain a mystery to everybody... They were, probably, unique... Till the day of the clash, they have never met an adversary who could offer them what they call 'a beautiful death.' They only were hoping with all the massive army gathered against them, there might be one down there who's up to the task (\\"Spartans! Ready your breakfast and eat hearty... For tonight, we dine in hell!\\").<br /><br />Both the Spartans and Samurai warriors were comparably fierce and passionate (\\"No prisoners! No mercy!\\")... They were raging soldiers (\\"Give them nothing but take from them everything!\\")... But at the same time they had an absolute code of honor on the essence of being a Spartan... And it's cruel, very cruel... When a boy was born, he was inspected... If he's been sick or deformed, the child is murdered... From the time he could stand, he was taught not to retreat, never to surrender... He was taught that death on the battlefield in service to Sparta was the greatest glory he could achieve in his life... At the age of seven, all the boys were taken away from their mothers and plunged into a world of violence, turning them into growing men, ultimate warriors the world has ever known...<br /><br />King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) was a legendary hero, somebody special... His name was the descendant of lions... He was very powerful, very thoughtful and perhaps in the film far more human than he is even in the graphic novel... Leonidas was a practical man whose life is matched by a straight road to one gleaming moment in destiny and that day, he couldn't meekly swallow the insult of Sparta's submission to the world of Xerxes... \\"This is Sparta!,\\" as he shouted to Xerxes' emissary, affirming that there is no softness, no place for weakness, and only the hard and strong may call themselves Spartans...<br /><br />What I loved about Leonidas was his needs, in his moment of indecision, of a back-up, maybe a second opinion, some assurance of his wife Queen Gorgo... So we see him, both times, looking to his wife...<br /><br />Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) was a great character not only in the film but in history... She was sexy and beautiful and above all tough and aggressive... There was intensity, elegance and ability in her... Also a kind of femininity in her nobility... There's only one moment when she loses it at the end and it was not a breakdown...<br /><br />We know lot of Queen Gorgo thanks to Herodotus, the father of the history, who chooses to write about her which clearly demonstrate she was significant... Spartan women were special anyway, they were incredibly beautiful and Sparta was the land of beautiful women... They were beautiful because they were physically fit, because they were allowed to exercise... They were not repressed and were considered incredibly potent... Gorgo could speak among men because as she affirmed it before the Persian emissary: \\"Only Spartan women give birth to real men!\\"<br /><br />Gorgo's one love scene with Leonidas and the dialogue beforehand, was powerful: \\"It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen SHOULD do nor a husband, nor a king. Instead ask yourself, my dearest love, what should a free man do?\\"<br /><br />Brutally violent and completely faithful to Miller's work, Zinder's \\"300\\" is inspiring, brave, and bloody artistic film...ue beforehand, was powerful: \\"It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen SHOULD do nor a husband, nor a king. Instead ask yourself, my dearest love, what should a free man do?\\"     Brutally violent and completely faithful to Miller's work, Zinder's \\"300\\" is inspiring, brave, and bloody artistic film...
B001DDBCV4|5.0|Believe it or not - I'm not one of those people that actually watched the series..... I glanced at it once or twice but never got into it.  But, when the movie came out, I was one of the first to get a group of my closest friends to go and see it.  After that, I seen it one more time in the theater, then purchased the movie on regular DVD and now on Blu-Ray.  It's just a fun movie to own to take you out of little trivial parts of your day-to-day world.

As so many of us get consummed with the day to day fire fighting of running our businesses, it is great to have Gerber to remind us of the ever important mandate that we must, \\"work on our business - not in or business\\".  Of course, this is easier said than done, but in this book he provides the essential tools with which to do so.
6305428352|4.0|Mr. Holland's Opus starring Richard Dreyfuss is a sweet and honest film from beginning to end. Dreyfuss is fantastic in this as a high school music teacher who is popular with his students but fails as a father and husband. This film goes through a lot of ups and downs, I enjoyed every minute of this inspiring drama. Glenne Headly is such an under-rated actress, wish directors would give her the time of day. Good film, I highly recommend it!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I learned about Fleet Foxes while standing in line at a local Starbuck's. The description of the album in the counter caught my attention so I decided to pick it up later that week. What a discovery! Clearly one of the best albums to hit the shelves in 2008.<br /><br />The harmonies in this album bring The Beach Boys to mind. Yet, they don't sound LIKE them... They blend their gorgeous vocal arrangements perfectly with acoustic guitars, piano and drums, yielding a fascinating folk rock sound that is quite welcome in the Indie space.<br /><br />The Fleet Foxes self-titled album is clearly a work for the ages and one that fits quite nicely for the road.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I watched this film last night with my mom, and we both loved it.  The special effects are phenomenal, the acting was terrific, and the one-liners were a scream.  I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this movie.  A must have.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|If you love the original King Kong, you will be satisfied with watching this Blueray version instead of DVD.  Because it is extremely outstanding to have it if you would like to enjoy the new story and new movements of animals and Kong, and it's no longer boring.   The movement is still paper-like, no gravity like action as it uses CG, however, I love Kong!
0312323867|4.0|The Good: I picked this book up, without even looking at the flap, because I so loved Something Borrowed.  I had no clue what it was about.  When I began the book and realized that the same characters were in this one, I got excited.  Then I promptly got un-excited when I realized that the central first-person character of this book was Darcy -- the lying, cheating, spoiled brat \\"best friend\\" from Something Borrowed.  I was immediately concerned that this book, being told from Darcy's perspective, would taint my fondness toward the Rachel and Dex characters from the first book, and I did not want that.  It's always nice to look back fondly on characters you really like and/or identify with from a book you truly enjoy.  I thought that Giffin might use this book to make you feel sympathy for spoiled Darcy and shed light on why she did the things she did.  But to my surprise and delight, she did not.  What's more, Darcy is still the annoying, shallow character that she was in the first book.  You would think that would make for an annoying read, but it does not.  Giffin pulls it off somehow and keeps it intriguing.  And if ever there was a story of positive character evolution, this is it.  Darcy does change over time, for the better, but not at the expense of the characters you may have grown to love.  The ending of this book, too, is worth noting.  Few really good books have really good endings in my opinion, but this one does.  The final pages of the book are poignant, poetic ... perfect.  And without being fairy tale saccharinized.    The Bad: There really isn't anything bad about this book.  I can only say that I missed Rachel and Dex in this book -- they have few appearances on the pages of this book -- but they weren't really the point of this one.  And all in all, it still doesn't compare to Something Borrowed -- likely to be Giffin's best work.    The Summary: First, if you haven't read Something Borrowed, you must.  These books are not to be read out of order.  Assuming you have ... The beginning of the book sheds light on Darcy's antics leading up to and including what happened in Something Borrowed.  Darcy is still with Marcus at the start of this story.  In fact, she gets pregnant.  Unfortunately, Marcus and Darcy are no more a match made in heaven than Dex and Darcy were.  After Marcus and Darcy break up, things fall apart for Darcy.  Her parents are upset with her, she is alone, she is abandoned by her new best friend Claire, she's of course without Rachel in her life, and she's pregnant to boot.  She ultimately takes a leave of absence and goes to London to visit Rachel and Darcy's childhood friend Ethan -- her absolute last resort and desperate escape.  Darcy continues her shallow, self-centered ways for quite a bit of the book, until some harsh words and circumstances help Darcy to see the error of her ways.  The remainder of the book has Darcy evolving into a new and better person.  It's quite a journey to get there, but definitely worth it in the end.
B000YI7MRM|4.0|only with the caveat that you've read the series (at least to The King's Gold).  Yes, it could seem a bit disjointed, even if you have read the books, but to me it came over as more of a stylized interpretation.  Perez-Reverte's writing feels somewhat stylized to me as well, so i rather thought it worked.  Don't go into this film looking for big budget stuff, it's more like an art-house Errol Flynn movie.
B001LRJH0U|3.0|I agree with the other reviewer who said this movie is just not fun.  Look for Open Range or 3:10 to Yuma if you want a great recent western to watch, this one is stern and bleak and harsh.  They paid great attention to period detail, almost to the detriment of the story.  period detail should be pervasive and unobtrusive.  It is very self conscious about being a western.  Very sparse story, and not extremely interesting, what little does happen.  I liked Appaloosa, but I didn't love it. It would be kind of like you could have set up a security camera for two hours in a town in the Old West for two hours and watched that.  Fascinating, but ultimately pointless. Great character study, not the greatest story.  Probably reads better (the book is by Robert Parker) There is almost no reason for Jeremy Irons to be in this. Rene Zellweger is a little miscast, though I do like her.  perhaps Ed Harris will loosen the reins so to speak next time, lighten up and have some fun with directing. He did good work, just kind of heavy.
0143038583|5.0|I found this book more revealing than I expected! I ordered three copies to send to family members & I have recommended it to several people interested in food!     I learned much more about how and why America's food and diet has become what it is and all within most of our lack of knowledge and some people's greed.  I do not want to sound like I am presenting a conspiracy theory but the involvement of government in farming has severly damaged the quality, quantity and abundance of food in America contributing IN PART to the tremendous health disorders in our country.      Buy this book if you are interested in food and   your life or the lives of your children.  Do not buy this book if you don't care about food, your life or the lives of your children.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|This movie is more of a space parody on the line of Galaxy Quest (1990) (just missing Alan Rickman) or maybe Down Periscope (1996). This presentation has every space, cowboy, militaries,  and clich&eacute; in the book.<br /><br />Of course, this must be much more to the old TV series fans. However, as a standalone film it is just one of those things.  Standard ninja bad people, and outlaws vs. empires.  Sexy women and bare feet.  Speaking of feet, the internet even has blogs about summer's feet. I cannot repeat it here.<br /><br />Be sure to watch the extra DVD goodies (bonus material) and the BD-Live: My scenes. The U-Control function can be a tad distractive. When you see what they were, trying to accomplish the next time through the presentation will be more enjoyable. The Blu-ray treatment is impressive but I never saw the original to compare.<br />Basic story is about the lives of the crew and visitors on the spaceship Serenity as they are pursued by the authorities for knowledge they may possess that can disrupt the perfect society.  Does the Crew know what they carry and will they find the secret before they are squashed like a bug.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001EN71CW Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition) ~ Tim Allen ]]
B00133KFGW|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen this year. This is a story of a boy who is trying to find his parents as he discovers he has an amazing talent to create music.  I could feel his joy as he first played the guitar.... and as he first played the pipe organ, each with the skill seemingly gathered over years of time.  I wouldn't want to say too much about the story as you should experience it as I did, with little knowledge of the plot.  Just know that, if you enjoy music to any extent, this movie will captivate you, as it did me....
B0014DFCMS|1.0|*********Spoiler Alert************    OK, I am one of the, \\"Oh, you've got to see Juno,\\" suckers.  If you eliminate Page's weighty brown eyes, the movie has nothing to offer.  No morality tale, no wow factor, nothing.  The only person I could relate to in the film was Bateman.    The situation was feasible until the stupid ending.  Juno's father was the best actor in the group, followed by her mother.  The movie was an exercise in shoving 'cuteness' down one's throat, without mercy.      My copy goes up on eBay very soon.  I consider this movie one of my few DVD buying mistakes.  The fact that this won the Oscar for the best original screenplay just lets you know that the Oscar's are just one big lemming fest.    This is the story of a cute little girl who gets pregnant.  The parents treat the situation as if she got a door ding on the car at the mall.  She has zero relationship with the father of her baby during the movie, except for the act that got her that way, and at the end of the movie, she all of a sudden realizes that he's her future.  And that with really zero character development of the baby's father and their relationship.  The situations were nonsensical and unreal.  It's a mess. When the author went to the stage to collect his Oscar, he should have refused it, telling the audience thta he's not taking it out of respect for all the former winners who actually created worthwhile scripts.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I love the way this bad rocks. To me the singer sounds a lot like Johnny VanZandt of Lynyrd Skynyrd ,And guitarist sound like The Cult on Bad Girlfriend. People like to knock NickleBack,And Puddle Of Mudd for there sound.But if Theory is trying to duplicate those band, they could  not do any better.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I am totally amazed by this movie.  The animation is exceptional for a movie made in the mid 80's.  The story line is fantastic and the illustration of the toxic jungle is life-like.  Miyazaki makes incredible movies that touch right to the heart and soul.    I have most of his movies and the kids and I enjoy watching them over, and over, and over again.  It is entertaining throughout this entire movie.  I still can't believe how well they illustrated the \\"warrior\\" near the end of the move.    Steven K.

B001EXE2ZG|5.0|This movie was wonderful.  I was required to watch this movie for an English class and it was awesome.  I really enjoyed it.  Gloria Swanson is brilliant.  I highly recommend this movie.
B0014KD46W|4.0|All Steve Winwood's various musical guises throughout his career exude something in common -- good musical taste. Nine Lives finds him in \\"roots\\" mode with mostly stripped-down exercises in blues, funk, jazz, and R&B -- most seemingly driven by Afro-Caribbean rhythms. Winwood the tunesmith is variable here; but the always soulful, enunciation-challenged voice and tasteful musicianship are still compelling. While not necessarily emulating it, the vibe is closer to late Traffic than anything he's released since going solo for good way back in 1980 -- and no synths, yea! The urban-tinged \\"Dirty City\\" features the inimitable guitar backing of old Blind Faith bandmate Eric Clapton. Fans should enjoy this album, though it makes no obvious pretensions of appealing to the Top 40 crowd.
031606792X|5.0|Despite the criticism of the ending, I loved it and thought it all tied together nicely. My fav of the 4!
B000MCIBAW|5.0|Now how about this?  It didn't have any big singles, it seemed to just sort of slink past audiences (especially in comparison to the success of their debut), and to this day it's regarded as a good but not great effort.  I disagree.  This record is so strange, so trippy, so psychedelic, so timelessly dated (!), that, like a moonlit trance, it's hard not to get sucked in.  On top of that, the songs are well-constructed, impeccably performed, and Morrison's lyrics seem to be not only pointed but meaningful and even--god bless you, James Morrison--poetic.  It loses a lot of steam on Side Two, thanks to the kitschy \\"People Are Strange\\" (Echo & the Bunnymen made it seem better, since everything was worse in the Eighties), and \\"Horse Latitudes\\" on Side One is completely unnecessary.  Otherwise, start to finish--mostly--this one's a blast.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Obviously, reviewing music is very personal, but there is something about music that can be universally penetrating.  After Enya's last 2 albums, I feared that she might make the adjustments or changes in her voice that Sarah Brightman made (not impressed with Sarah's \\"A Winter Symphony\\"--based on Sarah's MP3 samples only).  I placed this CD into the player with trepidation.    (Sigh) How do Enya and Roma make it happen?  I wanted so deeply for the music to be good...  And... The music and words penetrate my soul and declare they are not of this Earth.  The music on this CD evokes emotions that I can scarcely describe.  How can she sing these songs without tears cascading?  Enya and Roma plumb the depths of music dancing with lyrics.  Here are some thoughts on each song.  Some of what I write might make more sense if you already have the CD, but hopefully my words help those who do not yet have this beautiful music.  I decided to go with the songs numbered format.    1. And Winter Came: Sweet, instrumental preparation for what is to come (on the CD and in the future).  2. Journey of the Angels: An imaginative, soulful journey of clear, pure music ringing a true and complex picture of a new-born king.  3. White is in the Winter Night: The palpable images and colors enliven my senses and the music builds and builds toward a glorious song experience.  I long for the song to continue.  4. O Come, O Come, Emmanuel: Stop; listen; you can hear the past, the present, and the future calling in a melodic voice, \\"Rejoice!\\"  5. Trains and Winter Rains: a nice song to recover and rest from emotions.  6. Dreams are More Precious: I hear the protection of the Shepherd bringing light from darkness and sweetly singing comfort to endeavor the sorrowful journey and seek the precious.    7. Last Time by Moonlight: How music surfaces the memories and encourages us to remember!  Cherish this song and cherish the memories and cherish today for no one knows.    8. One Toy Soldier: The music and rhythm birth this story of redemption from sorrow to joy (and so glad she stayed with the \\"Happy\\" Christmas).  I am glad for the joy Enya celebrates here or the next song might be unbearable.  9. Stars and Midnight Blue: I did not think that she could sing a song more sad than \\"Fallen Embers.\\"  In this song \\"Stars,\\" Enya clings to and mourns intimate memories, and the music and lyrics cut to my heart and leave me still as cold, cold stone, staring at the stars (and blue).  10. The Spirit of Christmas Past: She knew.  She wrote the first line: \\"When tears are in your eyes * it's time to look inside * your heart can find another way.\\"  The hope coming in Christmas lifts my head through this song and points me to tomorrow.    11. My! My! Time Flies: A thoughtful song that I am still thinking about.  My daughter caught the \\"4 guys\\" reference before I did (a 14 year old who has been brought up well on classic rock).  12. Oiche Chiuin: Enya's care, thoughtfulness, precision, and clarity ring their flight and carry me over the years to a silent night.    But don't take my word for it.  Experience the music for yourself.
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|Building off the blues leanings of \\"[[ASIN:B000MG1ZG0 Morrison Hotel]],\\" about as mythically grand and naggingly yearning a send-off as Morrison deserved.  On this album, he sounds less concerned with seeming like an arty genius and more intrigued by the notion of being an arty genius, which he accomplishes through been-down-so-goddamned-long laments to a gray-skied, perpetually-disoriented America.  The bass player they picked up made their dark-underbelly lullabies seem undisputably genuine.  The keyboards are mesmerizing.  And John Densmore provides noteworthy examples of the ever-elusive \\"soul drumming.\\"  Obvious highlights are \\"The Changeling,\\" which entrances, \\"Love Her Madly,\\" which lightens things up a bit, and a dynamite cover of \\"Crawling King Snake,\\" one of the most compelling submissions for the position of Rock Poet Demigod Morrison produced.  The should-be-obvious highlight: \\"Riders on the Storm,\\" as unearthly and haunting an end to an album as any I've ever heard.
0525951113|4.0|A daemon, as the author explains in a headnote, is \\"a computer program that runs continuously in the background and performs specified operations at predefined times or in response to certain events.\\"<br /><br />Fine.<br /><br />And those \\"certain events\\" come thick and fast in this techo-thriller about a man dying of cancer who has created, through his computer games, such a program in hopes that with its distribution his whackadoo philosophy (there's this almost Ayn Randian rant at one point about parasites and sexual reproduction--wait for it) will . . . will . . . why, of course: Rule. The. World!<br /><br />The ragtag plot in itself seems like the scenario for a computer game. (Start the game. Who do you want to be? The cop? The hacker? The govt. agent? The thief? The prisoner? The newswoman?) And then breaks out, in multiple pov style, to follow the various characters (and nonplayer characters who get in the way), as they attempt to stop the Daemon or accept it. But you don't have to be a gamer to like the book: the author's clear no-frills prose explains the computer stuff with clarity.<br /><br />There are scenes that make me drool waiting for the movie version--robo killer cars??!! And there's a chilling scene where spammers . . . well, you'll see.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some suspension of disbelief is required. Maybe you'll have no trouble accepting that, well, yes--the dead guy's a genius. But no game AI decision tree is sophisticated enough to anticipate everything. In addition, after one incredible burst of action, the book tails off into a surprise ending that, while it certainly surprised me, left things dangling. Lookie yonder. I think I see a sequel coming this way.<br /><br />Note: Got this one as a freebie through \\"Vine.\\" Thanks, Amazon.

B00005N5S5|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie, check the other reviews for that. I'm am however going to steer whoever is thinking about getting this DVD about this version of the movie. I bought this thinking it was the Special Edition version DVD, based on some of the 4/5 star reviews and the images posted for the product, which are for the Special Edition. I posted the correct images for this DVD.    ***THIS IS NOT THE SPECIAL EDITION***    This DVD comes with a lenticular sleeve which is nice.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Here is another great concert from, in my opinion, one of the most talented bands around.  If you haven't seen them before, this is a great dvd. As good as it is though, I would say the R30 dvd is the one to get to get a feel for their whole catalog of music. I went to this tour and was a little let down by their playing too much off of the new album. (Which some bands are doing these days). But it's Rush, and I HAD to see them because they might not come around again...you never know!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|In my opinion,  this film stands alongside \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"Charlotte's Web\\",  and \\"Mary Poppins\\"  at the pinnacle of family entertainment.  A great surprise hit when it was released,  it now has a firm and enduring place in the pantheon of great films.    This is a movie for everyone to cherish,  over and over again.  It does not insult childrens' intelligence,  as so many kids flicks do,  and it delights the adults as well.    All of the characters are charming and well developed.  The lush Aussie scenery is gorgeously filmed to great effect.  Extraordinary production values all around.  Babe should have won for best picture--does anyone recall which film beat it?      This is a classic for the ages--and for all ages.  Only the foul-tempered cat might disturb the very young.  And even the adults (me included) will find a box of tissues very handy.  The floodgates open every time I see it.  But nothing here is heavy-handed tragedy a la \\"Old Yeller\\" or \\"The Yearling\\".  And certainly none of the war and gore of \\"Watership Down\\"--which is not for children at all.  This is \\"G\\" rated with all that the rating implies.    So,  grab your family,  or watch it with your adult friends.  You can't go wrong with this fine example of cinematic magic and sheer joyousness. Can't wait for the BluRay!  Now how much longer do we have to wait for a truly classic version of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"?
031606792X|5.0|After reading Eclipse, I immediately wanted to finish the series and read Breaking Dawn because I was so excited to see what happens next. At the same time i was nervous because i was unsure of how it would end.    Now that I have read it more than once... i am an absolute fan. Everything about this book i loved so much.    The wedding was romantic and sweet and lovely.     The honeymoon was a great read. It really showed Bella and Edward's intimate moments of love for each other.    The part where edward realized she was pregnant was a little funny.. i could picture his reaction while reading it.    I enjoyed seeing the love/hate relationship between Edward and Jacob.    The birth of Reneesme was like a rollercoaster for me and i was surprised to see that was when the transformation would take place.    Everything after that.... the entire book was wonderful and i have read it more than once.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|My grandma took me to see this when I was seven years old.  I was creeped out, intrigued and enchanted.

Every time Mr. Connery is paired with a gifted, less well known actor he seems to bring out the best in both of them and Finding Forrester is no exception.  F.

All in all a satisfying film that will easily withstand repeated watching.
B001CDLAT4|4.0|This month's highly recommended DVD is Baraka. I've watched and showed this dazzling film to my painting students over the past several years. I can tell you the power of this visually enlightening film by describing everyone who has watched this to the end. When Baraka was over, no one moved, or even spoke. They simply sat, staring at the screen - then composed themselves and eventually filed out of the room. That's the strongest testimonial I can give you!<br /><br />Baraka is powerful... no dialogue. It's a visual documentary of a poetic tour of the globe set to the rhythms of various religious and spiritual rituals, spanning diverse locales as China, Brazil, Kuwait and major US and European sites. The soundtrack will lubricate your mind. If you are an artist, you will want to own this DVD! Hint: To fully enjoy this experience, turn off the phone, sit quietly and close to the ones you love for just a few minutes before pushing the play button. It will be memorable. Baraka must be seen, felt and experienced to be understood.

I sought this out after hearing the Johnny Cash version of \\"Solitary Man\\" on \\"Stargate Atlantis\\" and after hearing Johnny perform \\"The Wanderer\\" on one of my U2 albums.  I've never owned a Johnny Cash album or a country music album other than Glen Campbell's Greatest Hits, but old Johnny does a fabulous job with all the songs here.  Granted, I'm not a fan of all the songs, but you can give this album a listen without constantly wanting to skip ahead.  \\"The Mercy Seat\\" is a fine song about a guy who ultimately goes to the electric chair.  It's a new favorite of mine.  I might even seek out some more Cashola after this pleasant experience.

0316017922|5.0|I loved this book because it gives some scientific insight into what a lot of us know from common sense.  I know someone who has a genius IQ, but has never done anything useful with his life. This book shows how past a certain point, IQ doesn't matter in your overall success.  I also know that because the cut-off date of my birthday, my parents chose to wait to start me in first grade until I was almost a year older than the other kids.  Consequently, I was always ahead of the curve academically because of my age.  I know other people whose parents chose to start them a little earlier in school, and they never catch up academically. This affects their self-image of being a success and they compare themselves unfavorably to other folks.  I loved this book, it is fascinating and seems to prove a lot of the beliefs I already had.

B001KX50BK|4.0|The delightful and charming romantic comedy \\"PRETTY WOMAN\\" which would win hearts courtesy of the wonderful performances by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts and its fantastic music now makes its Blu-ray debut nearly 20 years after the film's debut.<br /><br />When I first watched this film, I absolutely fell in love with it.  I purchased it on VHS, the CD soundtrack, the director's cut LaserDisc, the 10th Anniversary and then the 15th Anniversary DVD special edition, multiple release which I didn't mind.  The film has become so much of a favorite that I have traveled to Beverly Hills to check out the Beverly Wilshire, to looking for similar suits and ties around that time period that Edward Lewis would sport, discovering the opera \\"La Traviata\\" and eventually listening to opera music.  Needless to say, this film at the time, really touched my life and it's hard to believe that nearly 20 years have passed by.<br /><br />There are so many memorable moments in the film that are just classic, it's a film that has become a classic.  Just to let everyone know, this version is the theatrical version and does not include the director's cut with the extra five minutes of footage.  But how does the Blu-ray edition fare?  Read on.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />The film is presented in 1080p high definition (1:85:1).  The picture quality is not eye-popping beautiful if compared to a film created in the past few years but for a film nearly 20 years old, it looks pretty good on Blu-ray.  There are a variety of scenes that I really looked closely, one being Vivian's first trip to Rodeo Drive and seeing how the outdoor shots would be, the second would be at the polo match and another would be during the restaurant scene.  The picture quality was very good but it had a bit of grain, which is no surprise since grain is part of film.  But again, it wasn't vibrant compared to a recent film but for a film of its time, it looks very good on Blu-ray.<br /><br />In fact, the film on Blu-ray is the definitive version to own ala picture quality.<br /><br />As for the audio, the audio is presented in English 5.1 uncompressed (48khz/24-bit) and having a lossless English 5.1 48khz, 24-bit track is pretty damn good.  If anything dialogue is clear, music is very clear and it's what I expected from a dialogue-based film.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The special features included on this Blu-ray are special features that people have seen on DVD.  Included are:<br /><br />  * Blooper Reel - A blooper reel that is quite dated ala picture quality-wise but otherwise fun to watch.<br />  * \\"Live from the Wrap Party\\" - Richard Gere, Garry Marshall and band along with Julia Roberts jamming.  Richard Gere was great on the piano and Marshall, playing the drums and Roberts singing.  A fun featurette but was probably taken via a personal video camera because it looks dated.<br />  * LA: The Pretty Woman Tour - This section allows people to select on a map, various locations featured in \\"Pretty Woman\\".  For example, click \\"Beverly Hills Wilshire\\" and video plays with Garry Marshall giving you his memories of the location and information about it.<br />  * 1990 Production Featurette - A featurette on the making of the film, interviews and more!<br />  * \\"Wild Women Do\\" music video performed by Natalie Cole - I was really hoping that we would see other music video hits included such as Go West's \\"King of Wishful Thinking\\", Roxette's \\"It's Over Now\\" and more but only a single video which was on the original DVD release.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer<br />  * Feature Audio Commentary with Director Gary Marshall - This is the same commentary from the 15th Anniversary Edition which was released back in 2005.  The 10th Anniversary Edition utilized the director's cut from the LD version and I'm often asked which commentary did I enjoy the most.  The 15th Anniversary/Blu-ray commentary has newer commentary and you hear details that Marshall remembers of the film andhow everyone has done since the release of the film \\"PRETTY WOMAN\\".  But commentary-wise, I felt Marshall's director's cut commentary was very good because it was not long after the release of the film, so a lot of details were mentioned in his first commentary.  Granted, for redoing a commentary for a film over 15 years later, was well done.<br /><br />Now, surprising is that the deleted scenes (which were included on the film for the director's cut on LaserDisc and the special edition DVD's) are not included as a special feature.  So, for those who prefer the extended version of the film, then the 15th Anniversary Edition DVD is the version to own.<br /><br />I personally love this film and when the LaserDisc version first came out, it was technologically big because it included the director's cut and featured an audio commentary.  With the Blu-ray edition, I wasn't sure if I would be blown away by the picture quality and the audio quality.  The Blu-ray experience of \\"PRETTY WOMAN\\" was in the most part good but not great.<br /><br />There are no extra special features that makes this better in content versus the 15th Anniversary DVD but its strength is that it's featured in 1080p High Definition and an uncompressed 5.1 track (48khz and 24-bit).  Picture quality and audio-wise, if you have a television and receiver that can take advantage of the high definition treatment of this film, then it's even much more enjoyable because of the better quality.  But anything more than that and unfortunately, there is nothing new special-feature wise compared to the 15th Anniversary Special Edition DVD.  I would have loved to hear a commentary or a retrospective featurette with Garry Marshall and some of the talent but with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts doing quite well with their careers, not sure if we would ever see that.  Hopefully in the 25th Anniversary release?<br /><br />Also, there are some who prefer the theatrical version and some who will prefer the extended cut version.  The Blu-ray version of the film is the theatrical version and the deleted scenes (extra five minutes of footage) added for the director's cut on LaserDisc and on the 15th Anniversary Special Edition DVD are not included on this Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />But overall, this romantic comedy is still enjoyable and charming now as it was then.  Richard Gere and Julia Roberts did a fantastic job, Garry Marshall did a spectacular job as well as with everyone cast in this film from Jason Alexander to Hector Elizondo, everyone did a great job.  It's a fantastic film period and of all the previous versions that have been released, having owned so many previous releases, the Blu-ray edition is the definitive version to own.ntary-wise, I felt Marshall's director's cut commentary was very good because it was not long after the release of the film, so a lot of details were mentioned in his first commentary.

B001ILFUD2|4.0|\\"Oliver and Company\\", the 1988 classic animated family film from Walt Disney was indeed a special film.  I remember watching this as a teenager and being in awe of how Disney would capture the city of New York with it hand-drawn animation, how the film would feature Billy Joel in his first acting role and featuring music from Billy Joel, Huey Lewis and Bette Midler.  The film would be a classic.<br /><br />But here we are 20 years later and \\"Oliver and Company\\" would now also be remembered as the film that would bring Walt Disney's animated films from the traditional hand drawn style and eventually leading it to the digital age as the first Disney animated film to incorporate computers.  Also, a new generation of Disney films that would have a slight bit of edginess for a family film and would lead to many other films that would follow the route paved by \\"Oliver and Company\\" such as \\"The Little Mermaid\\", \\"Aladdin\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and many more.<br /><br />\\"Oliver and Company\\" is a fun, family film.  The film features quite a bit of songs sung by Billy Joel, Huey Lewis and Bette Midler and the animation, taking place in New York has this urban appeal.  But the film does have it's charming moments and without spoiling the film, for parents who have not seen the film, the film does have it's dark moments with the main bad guy Sykes and his dobermans trying to cause problems for the dogs but at the end, there is a death (nothing to scare the young children but guaranteed for a toddler to probably ask their parents \\"what happened\\".  In essence, this film is a family film but it does have it's moments that may scare younger children.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Oliver and Company\\" is presented in Widescreen (1:66:1) and is enhanced for 16×9 televisions.  The animation does feature new digital mastering but compared to the remastering of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" for example which looks incredible for a film of its age, for \\"Oliver and Company\\", because the setting is in the late 80's and the animation is hand drawn for a large part of the film, it does have that feeling of an older film.  Computer animation was used for the vehicles and action sequences but the picture quality is very good for its age but it does show it's age.<br /><br />But the film has been digitally remastered and definitely looks good for a 20-year-old animated film.<br /><br />As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and sounds great!  The film is more or less dialogue and music driven and the music does come alive in the digital soundtrack.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The special features featured on \\"Oliver and Company: 20th Anniversary Edition\\" definitely has some major positives.  Included are:<br /><br />  * Games & Activities - All-New! Oliver's Big City Challenge Game - I played this game with my son and it's not your usual, easy remote control type of game.  This one does involve some skill and memorization.<br />  * Backstage Disney - The Making of Oliver and Company - This featurette takes you back to when the film was created with interviews with Billy Joel, Bette Midler and other talent in the film.  Especially how the film would be the first for Disney as it utilized computers.  It's fun to see these older, bulky desktop computers used for the work back then.  But this was the first film for Disney to utilize computer animation. So, it was nice to see this featurette.<br />  * The History of Animals in Disney Films - There is a second short featurette featuring the history of animals on Disney films.<br />  * Return of a Classic - This was a short feature on the 1996 theatrical re-release of the film.<br />  * Shorts - Academy Award Winning \\"Lend a Paw\\" (1941) Animated Short and \\"Puss Cafe\\" Animated Short - These two Disney animated shorts features the popular character Pluto and a surprise addition to the special features.<br />  * Music & More - Sing-Along Songs - Features two songs fromthe film and includes subtitles for people to sing-along.<br /><br />Watching \\"Oliver and Company\\" 20 years later when I first watched it in the theaters is a bit surprising, especially to see how far Disney has gone with their animated films.  Especially, knowing that this was the first film to utilize computers for its animation.  So, you see the merging of traditional hand-drawn style and computer animation.<br /><br />I never realized it until now about how much product placement was used in this film but after doing research on this online, I realize that to make New York feel realistic in animation, you need to have those forms of advertisements in the film and the product placement was not paid product placement.<br /><br />But for nostalgic reasons, it was really great to watch this film again and especially to watch it with my son.  All in all, twenty years later and Disney has done a great service by releasing this on DVD and giving it special treatment with wide variety of special features.  For those who own the 2002 version on DVD, the two are very similar in special features but the main difference is that the 20th Anniversary version is digitally remastered and includes the \\"Big City Challenge\\" game.

I couldn't put it down (and was constantly yelled at in school to \\"close my book\\".) Once you read the first book you have to read the next. It keeps you wanting to know more and more. I can't wait to find out who A really is and I hope they go into more detail about The Jenna Accident.
B0017MO10U|2.0|I've seen better episodes on TV.  Forgettable, don't even remember what it was about and it wasn't long ago that I saw it.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Just buy the album, reading this review is a waste of time.  However, if you're still unsure about getting this album, reading this review should help.<br /><br />First, to get the stuff people might complain about out of the way, this album doesn't have as much mysticism as Led Zeppelin usually have.  There is a decent amount, and it shows several sides to Led Zeppelin.  A lot of people have complained on how Jimmy Page did a lot of re-editing, but people regularly take parts of different performance and put them onto live albums.  Another complaint that people have had is that the improvisation isn't completely spontaneous, but there sure is A LOT of improvisation on some of the tracks.  There also are some non-improvised stuff.  It's also early, so some of the classics are missing.<br /><br />I myself feel that spontaneous or not, it's still good, I think that there is enough mysticism of Zeppelin on this album, and it has both their loud side and their soft side.  With a lot of live albums, there is a lot of re-editing and remixing, but that's not always bad.  I myself definitely prefer the idea of unedited live albums, but this is still a killer album.<br /><br />With the long drum solo, which was unedited by the way, John Bonham really has a lot of energy, and he really brings it out.  Jimmy Page has some pretty good unaccompanied, and accompanied solos.  John Paul Jones shines on bass, keyboards, and mandolin.  Robert Plant's singing is great, but he's also a pretty good harmonica player.<br /><br />I agree with Jimmy Page that this album shows Led Zeppelin at it's best and How the West Was Won.  I think that BBC Sessions is a good companion album, but I really feel that this is the album.<br /><br />BUY THE ALBUM ALREADY!!!
B001GKYBXA|4.0|First off, let me say that this album is getting a 4 star rating from me. I really really enjoyed this album.  I don't know the last time I have actually played an album over-and-over. To describe the album is difficult. It's not a rock / pop album.  It's not an experimental electronic album.  It's not a progressive album. So what is it?  I don't really know. It's a combination of so many things, sounds, movements, moodiness, spiritualness, and yeah, some moments of pop/rock/psychadelica and many other things. Not so simply put, it's avant-garde yet mainstream accessible.<br /><br />Funny, when reading a number of reviews I noticed that with every other McCartney album, people, most of whom like the album, differ on what songs they recommend. My two favorites are \\"Sing The Changes\\" and \\"Light From Your Lighthouse\\".<br /><br />One last thing, please note, since this album doesn't really sound like anything else, it may take more than one listen to \\"get-it\\". Trust me here, it's worth it to give this album a try.  Ok, now for my track-by-track<br />review:<br /><br />Track One: Nothing Too Much, Just Out Of Sight:<br />Cool Song - has that Led Zeppelin Physical Graffiti era feel to it. I'm not saying this is as good as Led Zep - but it does have that vibe. Nice way to start off the album.<br /><br />Track 2: Two Magpies - Simply, just a cute song - it's only 2 minutes long, so if you don't like this one, not really a big deal, but it's a really good song to lead into:<br /><br />Track 3: Sing The Changes. Love this song!!! There is no comprehensible reason why this song is not getting significant airplay on alternative rock stations. This is my favorite song on the album - I personally like the uplifting lyrics and feel to it - and in context with what is happening in the U.S. right now with our new President, it's such an appropriate song.<br /><br />Track 4:  Travelling Light: Has a prog-rock feel to it - has a flute-like instrument throughout - very moody song -sortof like a song that could have been on Days Of Futures Passed. Second half of the song feels very Pink Floyd-ish.<br /><br />Track 5: Highway: Paul speeds things up again - the guitar / bass sounds reminds me of The Beatles - but which Beatles song I can't figure out. Nice song. This is the probably the most \\"commercial\\" song on the album - complete with backing vocals.<br /><br />Track 6: Light From Your Lighthouse - Paul's tribute to Blind Willie Johnson's version of the song from 1930.  Not sure if people know that this is a famous \\"traditional\\" gospel song. I love this song.  I can't stop listening to it over and over.  \\"Let it shine on, Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me\\".<br />I like the way Paul constructs his vocals with a mixture of deep voices and high voices mixed together to get that Creedence feeling to it.  Actually, I think Paul created<br />a new music genre with this song - Alternative Blue Grass - LOL! The song is only 2:31 - I wish it were a lot longer!!!  On first listen, people may not like the sound of his vocal, but give it two or three plays and you will love it!!!<br /><br />Track 7: Sun Is Shining: Paul goes from the alternative blue-grass sound above to a more straight-forward pop song. Paul always writes great songs about the sun shining. This song reminds me of Steve Miller's moodier songs such as \\"Wild Moutain Honey\\" and \\"I Want To See The World Turn Around\\" with a bit of Dream Acadamy's<br />\\"Life In A Northern Town\\" mixed in. Great sounding song.  You can hear all the varied instruments.<br /><br />Track 8: Dance Till We're High: starts with that \\"Be My Baby\\"/\\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\" drum beat - and turns into a really nice song.  I can see this being many people's favorite song on the album. This might sound crazy, but it reminds me a little of \\"Do They Know It's<br />Christmas\\".  Really nice song here!!!<br /><br />Track 9: Lifelong Passion: Song has a progressive / spiritual sound - again, this song reminds me of songs like Steve Miller's \\"Wild Wountain Honey\\" - but again,<br />it's the music - all the instruments layered that really make an incredible sound. I think maybe the song reminds me of Peter Gabriel or a song like the B-52's<br />\\"Revolution Earth\\".<br /><br />Track 10: Is This Love: This one certainly has that Peter Gabriel vibe - sort of sounds like a continuation of \\"Lifelong Passion\\" above - but a bit more tribal, like \\"world music\\". Truthfully, I think it's a nice sounding song, but not really the kind of song I will<br />be listening to over and over while driving in my car - where I do most of my music listening. The song has that end-of-a-movie with a spiritual happy ending vibe to it -<br />regardless, this song just sounds great on my stereo.<br /><br />Track 11: Lovers In A Dream: This is probably the most \\"Fireman-ish\\" song on the album with it's many sounds and collage-like feeling. Again, it just sounds amazing on my stereo. What's also cool about this, is the dance-beat that comes in a few minutes into the song.<br />I really can't describe this - it's like the Gregorian Monks on Ecstacy.<br /><br />Track 12: Universal Here, Everlasting Now: This one certainly is an experimental-type song - the first half of which sounds very reminiscent of Early Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd.  I like the way the song begins and ends with simple piano notes. Again, not the type of song I will listen to over and over - but sounds really good on the stereo.<br /><br />Track 13: Don't Stop Running: this is a perfect example of the difference between a McCartney proper album and doing songs under The Fireman name.  You can really hear how this could have been a straight-forward rock song - but in the context of Fireman, it really adds a nice<br />experimental / progressive feel to the song. Also, I know that bass sound - definitely from a Beatles song. Two minutes after the song ends is a bonus - has sort of a \\"Blade Runner\\" feel to it.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This was really well done.  It was brought to film flawlessly and the cast was perfect!  I was very impressed at how well it turned out.
0316017922|5.0|Outstanding understanding of circumstances, events, and timelines that can effect the success of many people.  Despite these circumstances, the 10,000 hours of practice and execution are needed for moving from being relatively good at something to outstanding.  This is a very insightful book.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|Ed Harris directed \\"Appaloosa\\" and stars as hired gun, Virgil Cole.  Virgil and his partner, Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), are hired by the small southwestern town of Appaloosa to replace the prior Sheriff.  The town has been terrorized by Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), a nearby successful rancher.  Two of Bragg's ranch hands shot a man, and the sheriff tried to arrest them but was shot by Bragg.  Virgil and Everett try to bring Bragg to justice while also dealing with an attractive young widow (Renee Zellweger), who begins a relationship with the taciturn Virgil.<br /><br />The basic premise of \\"Appaloosa\\" (a hired gun defends a helpless town) is time-worn in the Western genre, and it's certainly been done better.  However, the success of \\"Appaloosa\\" relies little on the plot and much more on its main strength - the characterizations.  In particular, the relationship between Virgil and Everett is fascinating.  The two men joke back and forth but clearly trust each other implicitly, given that they have to rely on each other for their lives in their line of work.  Renee Zellweger's dependent character is also finely detailed.  Ed Harris co-wrote the solid script with Robert Knott, based on the 2005 novel by Robert B. Parker.  Finally, the cinematography, art direction, and music are excellent, adding up to a believable western.  \\"Appaloosa\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable modern Western that compares favorably with recent genre flicks like \\"3:10 to Yuma\\" and \\"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\\"
0316036692|3.0|After reading the mixed reviews & against my better judgement, I finally picked up Outliers because 2 pals, independent of each other and coincidentally teachers, suggested to me that Malcolm Galdwell's books were worth a read (one suggested Blink, the other Outliers)    The ideas Gladwell promote in Outliers such as the importance of nurture over nature, the positive results of hard work and good timing etc. are familiar and in line with my personal observations of people I've met from all walks of life in the many cities I've lived in around the world.      However, some of ideas could have been better served with more research? e.g. the rice paddy theory -- Rice is cultivated not only in East Asia, but in Southeast, South & Central Asia and the economic & academic development of the countries where rice is a staple crop vary quite a bit.  Cherry-picking his data (and typos) have hurt rather than strengthened his argument. Although I'm not a teacher, Outliers reminded me of a thesis paper written in a hurry - great ideas but not very well constructed. I lost interest half way through the book (but I finished it anyway).    Outliers is worth the time spent speed-reading/flipping through in a bookstore/library (read the beginning & the end), but I don't think it's worth spending money on.  I'd suggest reading books by Daniel Goleman instead.  Or for a book filled with convincing anecdotes about our changing world, try The World is Flat by Thomas L. Friedman.
0517383322|5.0|This is a must have book for any book lover. I have the suede edition and it is just beautiful. The stories of Shakespeare still speak today. We just need to open our ears and our hearts so we can listen.
0060005696|5.0|This was a great little book, very interesting & quick to read -- I picked it up one evening at bedtime and finished it by noon the next day.  The main premise is that having more options makes us less satisfied with the options we eventually choose -- and considering too many options often leads to regret, remorse, uncertainty, unhappiness, and ultimately depression.  Those who always want to have \\"the best\\" rather than what is sufficient can suffer the most.<br /><br />The book is full of concrete examples and studies in which more choice leads to less satisfaction with the final choice.  He discusses plenty of every-day situations where overwhelming choice can cripple us and leave us dissatisfied.  There is an interesting discussion of how we compare factual scenarios -- what actually happened -- to non-factual situations, what might have happened, which are necessarily created scenarios.  Also, we can be very happy with a choice, but that happiness can be destroyed when we learn that someone else may have made what appears to be a better choice.  The author presents many examples of the inappropriate weight we often give to anecdotal evidence.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author presents evidence of seemingly illogical decision-making and allows the reader to say \\"Yup, that's me\\" and allows the reader to think about how to counter her own decision-making issues.  The very last part of the book, the author seems to cross the line from psychology into the self-help genre, implicitly encouraging the reader to keep a gratitude list, express gratitude, and incorporate satisficing into decision-making.<br /><br />Overall, though, a first-rate book, written in accessible language, containing page after page of the author's personal anecdotes and other examples and studies.  Highly recommended.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is probably one of the best books I have read in years. I have been sending it to my siblings as well as my friends. Told from the perspective of DEATH it is a story you won't be able to put down. Iam half German and half British and rarely does one find a story of the Holocaust that is told from the perspective of the German people. The Holocaust was a horrific event that affected so many people and contnues to reverberate even today, so many years later. Without giving too many details away, all I can say is read this book and pass it on to your fiends and family.
031606792X|5.0|I bought this book for my wife.  She blew through all of the previous titles of the series.  Knowing that the next part won't be released until later this year, she is reading this book very slowly.  However, she is more than half way through it, she reads it with complete amazment.  If her look can describe this book, the book would sell it self.  I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for a romantic scifi/fantasy book.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I loved this adaptation.  Although the actors who play Anne and her love  Wentworth are not exactly the Keira Knightleys or Orlando Blooms of the world, they do a flawless job here - very convincing, charming characters who bring this lovely book to life with the same charisma that Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle brought to Andew Davies' Pride and Prejudice adaptation.  I honestly grew so fond of the characters - I only wish it were longer but bravo!! Excellent!
B001MW0J2O|4.0|The previous album was a fun and brash collection of experimentation with a hint of beach boy-esque fondness for melody. On this one the hint has become more flamboyant without losing the experimental side as well. I have played this cd for people who are used to nothing but pop music and at first they go 'What the heck is that' but in a short while there response has been 'hey that is actually pretty good.' This is still ahead of where the music scene is at and may not be for everyone but I suspect its influences on upcoming bands will he heard in the years to come. So, if you want to hear what the bands are going to be doing in the future before hand I suspect this might be it.
031606792X|5.0|After reading Stephenie Meyer's first three Twilight novels, I had great expectations for Breaking Dawn.  I never thought that it would be possible for the story to take such unpredictable twists and turns, but I was proven wrong.  This book was so incredibly different from the previous three, but I thought it differed in a very positive way.    I loved that part of the book was told from Jacob's perspective.  His pessimism was perfect...I especially enjoyed reading the chapter titles during his sections of the book.  I'm glad that the book didn't end with Jacob being left in the dust.  He deserved more than to simply watch Bella become immortal and live happily ever after with Edward.  How else could this be accomplished than for him to imprint on someone other than Bella?  The page where Jacob imprints on Nessie left me speechless.  Not because I was disgusted or appalled, but because I was amazed at the turn of events.  Jacob's love for Nessie was not romantic or sexual at all; it was simply devotion and adoration at its simplest form.  Like a parent has for a child.     The other thing that shocked me in this book was the fact that Bella becomes pregnant.  This is something that I didn't see coming whatsoever.  At first I thought, \\"wait...vampires can't have children...\\" but I remembered that the reason that vampires cannot have children is because their bodies become frozen at whatever age they are, so a baby cannot develop.  But Bella was still a human!  She is completely capable of becoming pregnant.  The fact that Edward, a vampire, can impregnate a human girl is just another unique law of Stephenie Meyer's vampire world that I don't question.  Just like the fact that Ms. Meyer's vampires' skin sparkles in the sun, or that they don't have fangs.  It doesn't make sense to use our laws of anatomy and physiology because those don't apply to vampires.    I agree that Breaking Dawn is a much darker novel than her previous books, but I enjoyed the change.  The descriptions, from Bella's honeymoon to the birth of Nessie, were done tastefully and were not vulgar.  The description of Bella's painful transformation into a vampire was nearly unbearable, but it was described perfectly.  I was especially impressed with the way that S.M. handled the scene on Isle Esme.  Plenty of heart-pounding moments were described, but much more was left to the imagination.  That is the way it should be in a young adult novel.    Once again, I praise Stephenie Meyer for creating a story that allowed me to feel so many emotions.  I felt pity for Jacob and his alienation from his pack; anger at Rosalie for being selfish and thinking only about the baby and not Bella's own life; frustration when Alice and Jasper left; fear when Bella was almost killed by her half-vampire child; sadness for Edward's feeling of complete helplessness; excitement for Bella and Edward's marriage and honeymoon; but most of all: complete elation when all my favorite characters were able to have their own versions of happy endings.
B001G1ACVY|5.0|If you already like Jason, with this three disc CD/DVD you will love it!! One of his best works, and with that I'm saying it all.  First, the CD. Second, the CD with the acoustic editions of the songs. Third, the AMAZING DVD with a wonderful concert and the Documentary about his summer in Europe. And Fourth, the hand-writing everywhere.    It is worth your money.     Cheers.
B0013ND30W|5.0|First the bad...the front of the package says \\"LIMITED TIME ONLY\\" Includes bothe 2 disc blu-ray and 1 disc DVD.  OK so I open the package and I see two blu-ray discs, but no DVD.  Not a big deal as we are a home theater family, but it would have been nice to send the DVD to a neice or nephew.    That being said I must insert another con....too many Previews and In Theaters now at the beginning of the movie.  Almost ridiculous, thank goodness for the PS3 skip feature.    Finally the movie....oh man the movie.  I saw this as a child back in the mid 80's as a re-release in theaters, and thought it was pretty amazing then, but on a Home Theater 96 inch screen, with full surround sound (which is fantastic in DTS BTW) set at a humble 720P was almost geek heaven. The clarity was amazing, the colors were amazing, it was like getting a new book that was done by a master painter, and it was if you watch the movie with the commentary on.  Absolutely worth it IMO!     Well let's just say that any future release of any of the other classic Disney movies will be met with the sound of my credit card being swiped immediately!
B00064WSNW|5.0|Haven't heard new King Crimson music in decades. Based on glowing reviews I decided to buy Discipline and I'm glad I did. Excellent CD- really enjoying it. FYI- I like Peter Kater/Carlos Nakai's \\"Honorbale Sky\\" a lot too.
B001GCUNVW|1.0|Not only was this the worst movie I have ever seen, it was THE WORST leisure time experience I have ever experienced.    Worse than the time I broke three ribs in my back when skiing, and then coming down with a nasty flu the next day. Worse then the time I flew over the bars mountain biking, landing in sharp granite boulders, requiring a trip to the emergency room. Worse than the time I got road rash from skateboarding at mach speed, sliding along the pavement, and for days having the dressing stick to my wounds.    I went into this movie in a good mood. I left the theater downright angry that a couple of hours of my life were squandered away.    That terrible constant camera shaking and moving and moving and shaking and bouncing and moving and moving and shaking  and shaking and bouncing and bouncing and shaking and moving reminds me of the idiotic camerawork I used to see on low-grade Saturday morning teen and pre-teen programming.    Put me down as thoroughly disgusted with The Wrestler.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|The series starts out well, but goes down hill gradually ending with the last two episodes being a huge disapointment.  If you are a Doctor Who and Sarah Jane Adventures fan like I am that does not mean you will be a Torchwood fan.  I commend it for being a new kind of scifi show like there has never been done before.  It is very original.  I like dark things, but not the way this show is dark.  It has too many atheist and homosexual overtones to the point of being unrealistic.  At times you think that the main point of the show is about atheists and homosexuals.  If you could take those out with some good old Doctor Who style writing the show would have great potential.  Eve Myles who plays Gwen Cooper looks very beautiful as always.  She was also in the 3rd episode of the first season of the new Doctor Who series.  The DVD set has very good extras and commentaries much like Doctor Who DVDs from the new show.
B0000062FJ|5.0|It was 1969, Hawaii. We were a bunch of 16 year olds with one total fixation: SURFING! This music was the soundtrack for our self concept as surf-warrior's. We all swore that this music was specifically written and played for us... and we actually believed it. The aggressive parts, the smooth flowing parts, the slow build-up to an explosive part...all meshed perfectly with our surfing styles. My friend Tom and I saw them on their first trip to Hawaii. It was at the Waikiki Shell. Tickets were $3.50. It was like being emmersed in a dream. They rocked, but also had soul. The congas added a jungle-animal sensation. Love this album, it is perfect.
B0017PCX20|5.0|Well.. there is not much to say about this great production..  I can only say that from some years ago on I began to search for some music to give me emotions... beginning from Porcupine Tree, then No-Man and various prog-rock Artists which I could suggest you but I'm not here for them (exception for Nosound!! check them out.......).  Anyway I just want to say that every album marked as Kscope release, I can say it's a guarantee, and probably I'll make the entire catalogue mine some day!  Tightly Unwound is rich, of melody, of natual acoustic sounds and vocal harmonies... pleasurable and untiring...  When you listen to it you MUST like it.. cos there's no other way...  Also lyrics are pretty fine even if I'd say I'm captured first from the music that flows from kind-of-poppy songs till the composite bars that are usual of prog music...   The only disappointing, for a little while, point is the last track... where you expect form the lenght on the cover cd a kind of suite, instead it's a 7/4 a little bit repeating.  Out of this unimportant fact I end saying that these kind of album should be in the charts ever-after, but we all know that won't happen....  Do buy it..  It's worthwhile!    Davide Marani
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I am really impressed with the craft involved in the creation of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. I'm not sure if it would be possible to gather the quirky talents of all those illustrators again in order to breathe life into another childhood dream of the maker of this movie. Seeing the progression of his vision was an amazing journey.  My dad used to tell me about going to the movies on Saturday mornings to keep up with the serial adventures of honor-driven cowboys, bold & fearless space pioneers, and wiley private detectives. Sky Captain seemed to be the odd amalgamation of those serials run through a prism of Saturday morning cartoons from the 60s and transmitted onto a green screen past a handful of actors and a smattering of props.  I was so caught up in the fun of this movie that I bought several copies to share with those that I knew would appreciate it as I did.  Sadly, it looks like there will be no sequel to Sky Captain...but someone will reconsider this mode of film making again and I hope that they choose to do something heroic and not make the same pedestrian fare that gets slopped onto the silver screen by today's Hollywood hacks.
0765316897|5.0|WOW! I have to say this was one of the best Fantasy/Adventure series I have read in a long long time. The magic system is intrigueing, the characters believable and there are contunious twists and turns to keep even the most ardent James Patterson fan hopping. Best of all the end gives you everything, sad,happy,supprised and satisfied. This is a MUST series you will read again and again. Thank you Brandon Sanderson I am off to seek out more of your writing.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|For fans of The Matrix, this set is best to collect and understand the intricate world in which they operate Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and Agent Smith. The quality of the additional material dvd's make this product a real gift for lovers of sciencie fiction movies.
B000002UTY|5.0|This year marks the 40th anniversary of this CD (album) and it still sounds great; one of the best musical things to come out of the \\"psychedelic era.\\" Every time I look at that beautiful cover, the western painting, I smile and think of this group's fantastic 25-minute \\"Who Do You Love\\" medley.  To me, it's still unique - even for that era - and still is enjoyable to hear.  For that \\"song,\\" alone, I'll always have QMS ranked among my top (and under-rated) rock groups of all time.    \\"Mona,\\" another long song that follows the medley, also is a great effort.  If you need a \\"demo\\" to show \\"kids\\" some of the good music of the late '60s/early '70s, this would be one to play for them.
031606792X|1.0|If there had been an option to choose zero stars for my rating, I would have happily taken it. I suppose I must settle for one star, though Breaking Dawn hardly deserves it.    I could talk about the horribly clichéed plot, or the way Meyer violated her own universe's rules, or the way it raised my blood sugar levels to dangerous heights... But I won't. Other people have better covered all of those issues.    No, the thing that bothered me the most was not Edward performing a cesarian section on Bella with his teeth. It wasn't Jacob imprinting on a newborn baby. It wasn't the way Renesmee was coded to read like the Anti-Christ, even though Meyer wants us to love her more than anything else in the entire universe.    What got me was that the latter half of the book was drop dead boring. Nothing happened. Nothing, that is, except the build-up of false tension toward an outcome that never played out. We met a lot of new characters nobody cares about, which were created with the sole purpose of selling Stephenie's Official Guide. While the Cullens (and company) were little more than cardboard cut-outs to begin with, they completely devolved into talking heads floating in space.    Meyer should have stopped more or less after Charlie's acceptance of Bella's new family. Literarily speaking, that is the place the story itself wanted to end. But no, Meyer had to draw it out for several hudred more pages after that. It hurt to finish. I don't even like the series and I was disappointed with the \\"courtroom drama\\" ending. The \\"Hamlet\\" ending would have been more satisfying, because then at least Bella would have had to sacrifice for what she wanted. As it was, everything was handed her on a silver platter. That's great wish fulfillment material, but not novel material.    Oh, wait, I forgot the point of the story. Wish fulfillment is all Twilight was ever meant to be. Carry on, then!
B000002KOQ|4.0|You see, I am of the opposite opinion of the Amazon \\"editorial\\" reviewer on this home page who states \\"the artful but sometimes dour meditations of her earlier work and the more mature, confessional revelations of the classics that would follow....\\"    I loved Joni's \\"dour mediations\\" of her debut album, especially. To me, those kind of haunting folk songs were fantastic, and still are 40 years later here in 2009.  The first four songs of this CD, from \\"Morning Morgantown\\" to \\"Ladies Of The Canyon\\" are like that, which is why I play those numbers so often, and the rest of the LP so little. When she went into her jazz \\"revelations\\" is when she began losing me.    Anyway, those first four, along with Tom Rush's \\"The Circle Game,\\" are enogh to make this a classic album I've played over and over. I also appreciate Mitchell's artwork, which can be seen on the front and back covers. She is one talented person!
1400063515|5.0|The most predictable thing about events in this world is that they are far less predictable than we think.   That is the thesis of this book.  Most people reading this review will have heard that Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of very few people who predicted the recent financial meltdown and made money betting on it.  Only a small portion of the book is specifically about financial matters.  Nevertheless, an understanding of the concepts here is essential for anyone hoping to understand the recent financial carnage.  And yes, making a remarkably accurate prediction is an ironic way to gain credibility for a message about the futility of prediction.    For centuries all swans were believed to be white and every known observation of a swan had served to confirm this belief.  Then a single observation of a black swan destroyed that theory.  This principle is known to philosophers as Hume's problem of induction or Popper's falsification principle.  It is known to investors as the fine print in the prospectus that says, \\"Past results are no guarantee of future performance.\\"  Taleb would prefer that this warning was taken out of the fine print and printed bold on the cover of the prospectus.    This book seeks to answer the question:  How do we make decisions when faced with opacity of information on which to base those decisions?  Taleb concludes we simply convince ourselves to be more certain than we have any objective right to be.  The reasons for this have deep roots in evolutionary psychology.  We prefer information that conforms to our biases.  We prefer anecdotes over scientific statistical analysis.  When we attempt scientific statistical analysis, we chose tractable models and mistake the model for the far less tractable reality.  We respond to even the most unpredictable events by quickly convincing ourselves (with the benefit of hindsight) that they could have been predicted and we won't fail to do that next time.     Taleb convincingly shows that Bell Curve statistical analysis is vastly overused in situations where it is not just useless but dangerous.  Usually this is done by confident, overpaid \\"experts.\\"  Using this model where it is not appropriate dramatically under predicts  the likelihood of rare events.  Even worse,  it dramatically under predicts the impact of these events.  A trader can lose a life's savings in an afternoon using the same methods that brought him a lofty income for many years.      In place of the Bell Curve, Taleb advocates the mathematics of Mandelbrot for studying most social and economic phenomena.  This will yield far fewer firm predictions but a much better appreciation of risk.  Attempting to find some examples of where the Bell Curve may work, he cites mortality and crime rates.  This may be a rare case of him being too generous with his foes.  History is replete with pandemics and societal breakdowns that blew up longstanding mortality and crime patterns.    Taleb aspires to be viewed as a big league philosopher.  His biggest fear seems to be that he will be viewed as just a successful (or worse - lucky) trader.  He is the type of polymath that you almost never see anymore in this age of hyper-specialization.   While few of the elements he uses originate with him, there is some important and creative synthesis here.  He effectively draws on philosophy, psychology, history, the mathematics of Mandelbrot, and his experience as a trader,  in support of his thesis.  Despite a showy vocabulary, he never hides behind jargon.  He has a genuine talent for making technical ideas accessible to a general audience.      The book is marred by Taleb's incessant name dropping.  He is very intent on establishing that his sensibilities in all things scholarly and cultural are unrivaled.  Perhaps this is true.  Even so, many readers will find it tiresome being reminded of it on every page.  He admits to sharing the same psychological instincts that make us all bad risk managers.  It's just that, his tone would indicate that, in himself,  these are charming eccentricities while in others they are contemptible weaknesses.  Like his hero Popper, Taleb preaches epistemic humility even as he is short tempered with all who challenge him.  These flaws did not detract much from my enjoyment of the book but for others they will.  How can you tell which group you are in?    One of the many relevant psychological principles Taleb cites is confirmation bias.  I was inclined towards his ideas before I ever picked up the book.  I had already concluded that most of what passes for economic prediction is useless - or worse.  And that watching CNBC can only make you dumber.      If you are inclined to believe that events are inherently predictable and that corporate risk managers make their companies safer, then you probably won't like this book.  On the other hand -  if you believe we have often been sold a bill of goods by \\"experts\\" in the prediction business  -  then you are likely to find this a useful and satisfying read.
B000002UB3|5.0|For years, friends would ask \\"what's your favorite album?\\"  I'd usually reply, \\"Side 2 Of Abbey Road.\\"  (Either that or the Grateful Dead's long medley on \\"Live/Dead.\\" I guess I like long songs!)    Before CDs, you had to flip over the vinyl records to hear the second half of the album.....and what a second half this Beatles record was!  Their best ever, I think.  That long medley, From \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" all the way to \\"The End\\" (literally), about 10 songs, still is as good as it gets, rock 'n roll-wise....even after 40 years.      The songs in that medley blend into each other perfectly, even though each number is quite different. Best of all, they sound fresh today, just as good as when we were introduced to them 40 years ago in 1969.  It almost makes me feel sad this great group didn't play together longer. The Beatles were always coming up with something original.

Here is my problem:<br /><br />Quick flashing camera angles.<br /><br />I *HATE* concerts where the cameras are moving so fast that it doesn't sit on a member of a band for more then a mili second. That's the same reason I couldn't get through Evanscence's Anywhere But Home DVD. Great stage shows - terrible camera angles.<br /><br />So in this case, the best band in this genre, come out with a promising dvd that boasts full classical symphony, great stage set and what have you - but all that is ruined by terrible quick flashing camera angles. There's even scenes that go black and white and some that even stays longer focused on an audience member then Sharon or Robert!<br /><br />No thank you.<br /><br />There are behind the scenes extras but really nothing that can make me go beyond two stars.<br /><br />There are better concerts with great angles on youtube which is what I am sticking to until these guys come out with another Dvd.

B001H5X7I4|4.0|The comedy is somewhat uneven in this full-frontal farce from Ben Stiller, but it is a great satire about the movie business, producers, actors, directors, awards, and more.  Robert Downey Jr. is the most politically incorrect one, playing an Aussie actor who gets his skin darkened to play the role of a black man in a movie about Vietnam.  His comments to Stiller about the latter's \\"going full retard\\" as Simple Jack are just priceless. Yes, they're politically incorrect, but we could use more of that!  Jack Black holds his own as a bleach blond, druggie whiner, while Tom Cruise takes the cake as a chubby, hairy, obnoxious and abusive producer back home in Los Angeles.  And Nick Nolte is perfectly cast as the grizzled Vietnam vet whose book is being made into a really bad movie.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers, exposes the myth that many people hold that great accomplishments are achieved solely by one's self with no help from anyone else. Young people just starting should have this information to help them understand that great accomplishments come from a community of efforts and not just from superhuman abilities.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|this show just get so better every single season i loved all the episodes except maybe ghostfacers but i do still get a good giggle over the episode they really brought out a lot more gore and the fx is getting better. bad day at badrock and the ground hog day episode every time i watch them i laugh at the same parts. there does need to be a few commenteries next season and the goof reel looks more staged this year then season two (every time i watch the gag reel in season two with not being able to open the window i just laugh so much)  the box set and the discs are top notch  we are behind so much in nz that i rely on getting the box sets from amazon so i am only a season  behind and i have been happy with the box sets that i will continue to get them as long as there is supernatural  i can't wait for season four dvd  i hoping that the eye of the tiger is in the box set.
0385340990|4.0|This book is written in the form of letters that are sent from friend to friend. You have to pay attention to who is writing to whom because there are a lot of characters. There were also times when I had to put the book down because I felt so overwhelmed from so many of them. The story was interesting and at times quaint, but I can not help but wonder if I would have enjoyed it more if I read classics more often. The books aren't the core of this story. Rather they are just the start of a friendship between strangers from different countries. At times it also did annoy me that there was no real plotline, just little tidbits about each others lives. The book was good and has an interesting setting.

B000A6T1KE|5.0|The only reason this movie failed in theatres is because they released it the week of Lord of the Rings: Two Towers. People always bag that this was the death sigh of the Star Trek franchise. I disagree. The most beloved film of the Trek motion pictures is Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. This is almost the blueprint of that movie as far as action goes and petty \\"Trek fans\\" hated it?? Come on people. Sure there are some little inconsitensies, such as how did Wesley Crusher make it to the wedding when he was transended somewhere with The Traveller? But he didn't even have a line in the movie. And I am sure somewhere in the Trek novel verse there is a story behind it. Come on fans, we get an epic space battle, the Captain getting involved in some air and wheel action. And the death of a major character with a very \\"Spock\\" cliffhanger at the end! SO all you fans out there, don't discount this movie as right up there with the other NextGen films. And those who will see the new \\"reimagined\\" Star Trek movie, pick this up and just enjoy it.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Being a Hong Kong Chinese over 40 who loves anime and Kung Fu much, you can bet I had watched hundreds of movies of this genre, primarily from Japanese. However, I must say that this may be the best mix of everything. The animals are cute. The story is old fashioned yet acceptably interesting to all ages. The art is fantastic that every screen shot can be taken as a wallpaper. The CG is brilliant. The choreography (the fighting) is excellent. I can hardly pick a significant shortcoming of it. I watched it together with my wife and she, not a lover of anime or Kung Fu movie at all, did love it and laugh frequently. Definitely a good entertainment after a decent meal at home. Recommended!
B001G5ZKZS|4.0|I enjoy listening to Rush. Certain songs get better with repeated listening.     Rush: Snakes and Arrows Live, is a great live three-disc release from one of the greatest bands.

Beyonce, basically should have waited till she had enough material to release another CD. The number of songs dosen't bother me, it the fact that you have 10 songs ( it might be 11 the CD isn't in front of me), and only three are really worth a release, because Single Ladies was crap to me.
0007240198|5.0|I stumbled on this book while researching critical thinking for a University course I teach to science and business students in Healthcare career tracks. Everyone in American higher ed is distressed and alarmed by the lack of CT skills of our students and our society in general. In my lifetime, there's been a decided streak of anti-intellectualism that has made our nation incredibly vulnerable to propaganda, advertising, and quackery in medicine, religion, and politics.  It's terrifying (though I have hope that the tide may be turning; our self-inflicted problems are of a size and depth that simplistic thinking and wilfull ignorance cannot prolong the fantasy that \\"it'll all turn out OK\\"). This book will become a required text for my class and should be read by EVERYONE.  Practitioners and patients alike will find it to-the-point, well-illustrated, and even fun to read (dry British humor that I read aloud to my 14-year-old, who now wants to read it as soon as I'm done!).  Yet there's no dumbing down at all.  This doctor's brain is a treasure and I'm grateful he wrote this book.  It will elevate the discussion of the healthcare crisis like no other book I've read.

B001DSNF8C|4.0|CASINO ROYALE<br /><br />**** Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- November 17th, 2006<br /><br />Running Time- 144-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- PG-13<br /><br />Screenplay- Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & Paul Haggis<br /><br />Director- Martin Campbell<br /><br />Starring- Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, Jesper Christensen and Judi Dench as M<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit I'm not the biggest fan of the Bond series, while I do enjoy the movies when a new Bond movie is released I'm not in a rush to go see it. I'll watch it whenever I get around to it. So my opinion on Casino Royale may not hold as much weight as the hardcore fans, but I'll give it a go.<br /><br />After the Die Another Day, which was the 20th Bond movie Pierce Brosnan was out as James Bond and Daniel Craig was in. While Daniel Craig has been around for a while he wasn't very well known. A lot of fans were upset that Brosnan was out. When it comes to the best James Bond that title is between Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan and it seems many lean towards Brosnan; Daniel Craig was getting some heat when he was announced, but after the release of Casino Royale many were now hailing Daniel Craig as the best James Bond. I think it's still too early to declare Craig has the best Bond, but he's on his way to earning that title; I'll get back to that later.<br /><br />The one amazing thing about this franchise is how it went from decade to decade starting in the 60s and is still going strong today. How many franchises can go on that long and change with the times? It's quite rare, but I'll give the filmmakers of the series credit for keeping the Bond flicks going strong.<br /><br />I'm not sure which of the series would be my favorite, but Casino Royale is a frontrunner, but the movie isn't without it's flaws. Casino Royale starts off quite explosive and while it stays strong through out I do think it could have been slightly better. The biggest problem I had was the 144-minute running time. While I wouldn't say Casino Royale ever dragged at all and each scene does move the movie forward I do think it could have used a bit of editing. I personally don't think the movie needed to be as long as it was, but with that said despite the running time Casino Royale never drags.<br /><br />The screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & Paul Haggis is well written and the characters are solid, but I have to say I wasn't too into the villains. In my opinion they were sort of forgettable. The Bond series has almost always had great villains, but this time around I never really cared too much about them. Besides that the script is quite strong with some excellent dialogue and excellent set ups. The Bond movies are often over the top, but not in a bad way, but the script here seemed a bit more real in my opinion.<br /><br />Director Martin Campbell previously directed the Bond movie GoldenEye, which happened to be the first time Brosnan played the role and here he is returning to the series and directing the part, which happens to be Daniel Craig's debut in the series. Casino Royale in my opinion might feature the best and most exciting action sequences of the series. The action is quite well done and strays from the typical Hollywood action movie put out these days and due to that they work even better. With 144-minutes it can be tough to keep the pace going and Martin Campbell is able to sustain a strong pacing and always keeps the movie interesting. I'm not really into poker and those scenes are the only time I started to lose a little bit of interest, but Campbell is able to keep the tension high and was able to keep my interest just when I would start to lose it.<br /><br />The Bond Girl is one of the most important things about any Bond movie outside of whose playing James Bond, the Bon Girl is the next big thing. Eva Green is the latest and while I did like the character she wasn't the best of the Bond Girls, but easily one of the sexiest of them all. Eva Green was good in her role, but I don't think she would be one of the elite, but she does work amazingly well with Daniel Craig and that in part helped elevate her a bit.<br /><br />I'm not sure who would take my top spot for James Bond, but Daniel Craig just might take that spot. His Bond was a little darker and a little more bad a** (almost reminds of Jack Bauer a little bit). From an acting stand point, Daniel Craig delivers a solid performance, but I don't think he's the best actor to play the role in line delivery, don't get take that wrong. I think Daniel Craig is an excellent actor, but I don't think he was the best in terms of delivering his lines, but from a psychical stand point I think he was by far the best.<br /><br />Daniel Craig also does really well with emotion without any lines. I don't wanna spoil anything, but a certain scene with Craig and Green towards the end is one of the best moments of the series and without any lines Daniel Craig was quite powerful. I still think it's too early to say Daniel Craig is the best, but he's well on his way. I haven't seen Quantum of Solace yet, so maybe that will put him over the top for me.<br /><br />Overall Casino Royale was an excellent entry in the series and Daniel Craig proved all the naysayers wrong and delivers a top notch performance. Fans of the series should enjoy and casual fans like me could also enjoy this. While Casino Royale stays true to the series it also takes a slightly different direction and possibly even non-fans might like this one.but she does work amazingly well with Daniel Craig and that in part helped elevate her a bit.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm thinking of buying the dvd, but since I'm an ON DEMAND customer I get the level 1 and 2 workouts for free. All I have to say is that it's very intense and within maybe 5 days you won't see a difference in that time, but you will FEEL it. I could barely do 2 push ups but after going through level 1 just for a week I am blown away at how much stronger I am. And you don't need 10 LBS weights! I work with 2 LBS and at the end of the work out I feel like I was lifting 20.    It's a must buy! (unless you have ON DEMAND, but you won't get level 3)

B00004XOWM|3.0|I used to like this album when I was a kid, but now it's nowhere near as great as I thought it was. This is probably Limp Bizkit's weakest album. The heavy-hitting sounds and significant lyrics found in \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'all\\" are completely gone, replaced by pop-rock melodies and annoying ramblings about money, women, and \\"living life in the fast lane\\". Much of the songs sound more like fillers than actual ones. But it's not a total loss. \\"Full Nelson\\" and \\"Take a Look Around\\" actually sound pretty good. \\"Boiler\\" and \\"Hold On\\" are the most mature songs on this CD. \\"My Way\\" . . . meh.<br /><br />Oh well, I'll still have \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'all\\" to listen to.<br /><br />Grade: C

B001L63JC8|5.0|I'd agree that Lamb is the best Genesis album. It's not fair to call it \\"Genesis' most ambitious work,\\" because all Genesis' work that include Peter Gabriel is ambitious. But Lamb connects through and though, with no dead moments, and as was said previously, holds up over time probably better than  most other Gabriel-era Genesis. And, like other great concept albums like The Wall and Supertramp's Crime of the Century and Tull's Passion Play, Lamb is worth staying home for an entire evening and listening to from beginning to end. Any modern equivalents? Perhaps Green Day's American Idiot, and definitely The Mars Volta's Deloused in the Comatorium.

B0000640RX|5.0|this set is something you wont want to miss, 3 great movies for a great price. the first movie, first blood is about a vietnam vet called rambo who goes to a small town, taking to prison by a cop, and escapes, and the police is trying to catch him. first blood is the most serious and smart movie in the series. it has great writing and some pretty good action, but ultimately, it is more of a drama, i think. i give first blood 4 stars. the next movie, rambo: first blood part 2, is actually my favorite out of the whole series.it sees Rambo released from prison by Federal order to document the possible existence of POWs in Vietnam, under the belief that he will find nothing, thus enabling the government to sweep the issue under the rug. the movie has the most action out of the whole series, i think. there are great moments of drama and romance and the climax with rambo in the helicopter had me shaking with excitement. it also has the most memorable landscapes. it give the movie 4 1/4 stars. i can't believe this movie won the golden raspberry for worst picture and other 3 awards! although i do admit it has the dumbest scene in the whole series. the next one, rambo 3, was pretty good, it did not live to 1 and 2 but it still is a fun little action movie. it is about rambo setting out to rescue coronel trautman from soviets in afghanistan. there are some pretty neat action sequences, the landscape is pretty cool, but it is the dumbest movie of the series, by far, with a ridiculous climax, some unbelievable action sequences, and an absolutely atrocious dialogue. however, it's rambo, not citizen kane. i give this movie 3 3/4 stars.  the movies get a 4 star rating from me and the special features get 5 stars from me. so, im gonna give this item 5 stars. rambo 1-3 are almost classic, and definitely better than rambo 4.

I am not sure whether to give the movie 4 1/2 or 5 stars. I give this dvd 0 stars. get yourself the extended 2 disc edition cut. i might sell the dvd i own. overall, this movie is something you should all watch. this movie has made me want to see sergio leone's other movies, especially once upon a time in the west.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|I'm not certain where people get the idea this was \\"faked''. That is totally untrue. Yes, it's a bit raw but this was taped during the live performance. The DVD has been only slightly edited. Very little was cut from the show. They only recorded during one nights performance and they had the entire DVD complete. You get almost exactly what happened at the live concert. How do I know this? I Was There! I think it was mass Re-produced and cheaply so. There in lies the problem with some of the DVD's. I have received a couple copies that skipped right out of the shrink wrap and some that were flawless. I am on my third copy for myself. I have worn out all previous copies. I truly love their performance that much. Nothing can recapture the magic of that evening but this sure takes me back to an awesome night and an awesome concert. If you desire an enthralling, engaging and enchanted show this is the DVD for you. Truly, this is worth every cent.
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|This is not a movie for children, much darker than the others in the Batman series.  It is worth watching for Heath Ledger's performance. I like Christian Bale as Batman.  I think he is the best of all the previous \\"Batmen\\".
1433502410|3.0|Please see end of review for revised rating, October, 2009.<br /><br />Frankly, I had the highest of hopes for this Study Bible. Crossway provided me with an examination copy because I really wanted to adopt it as a text for my OT Survey classes, because I have used the ESV since it was published. Alas, after over two months of review, I have decided that I can't adopt it. There are SO many good aspects of the ESV Study Bible, but many others have mentioned these strengths in many places. I echo some of those comments of praise, but some other things really bother me.<br /><br />So here are a few of my concerns. I am disappointed about the non-committal positions in the study notes about the how and when of creation. I am disappointed also in the weak position on the date of the exodus - they seem to tilt toward the later date. This is reflected in the weak note on the key chronological data found in 1 Kings 6:1. I am also concerned about its poor handling of many of the Messianic Prophecies, even those that are affirmed as such in the NT!  I expected the non-committal approach to eschatology, but it still disappoints me, since almost everything prophetic seems to be up for grabs in the notes. The world view of these note writers appears to reflect a VERY broad evangelicalism.<br /><br />Recently I was moved to write this brief review after reading the note on the identity of the \\"Daniel\\" who is mentioned in Eze. 14:20 along with Noah and Job. The writer (David Reimer) really saw no problem with those who identify this Daniel, not with the Daniel of the canonical book, but with the Dan'el in the Ugaritic texts!  This is done despite the fact that even non-evangelicals tell us that the Ugaritic Dan'el was \\"neither king, nor wise, nor righteous, nor even able to save his son.\\" (H.H.P. Dressler, \\"The identification of the Ugaritic Dnil with the Daniel of Ezekiel\\", Vetus Testamentum 29 (1979:152-61).  Furthermore, this Dan'el was a polytheistic follower of Baal, according to the tablet where he is mentioned! This is bad theology and shoddy scholarship. The OT editor should be ashamed for allowing this to be in the notes.<br /><br />Don't be overly impressed by the gushing praise written by some prominent people who evidently didn't bother to read the notes very closely. It is easy to be impressed by the slick production, beautiful maps and the sometimes quite helpful charts. Although there is plenty of good in this Study Bible, it is a shame that there is also so much that is weak. Professors may be able to handle this, but many laymen and students will be confused by the non-commital nature of many notes that involve important issues.<br /><br />I am also reviewing the NLT Study Bible, published also last fall by Tyndale. Contrast the following comment concluding its note on Eze. 14:20: \\"It is unlikely that a prophet as radically outspoken against idolatry as Ezekiel would have picked a pagan figure like Danel to represent unparalleled righteousness and wisdom. So Ezekiel is most likely referring to the prophet Daniel.\\"<br /><br />Kudos to Tyndale.<br /><br />Addendum on 6/26/09: I recently purchased the Apologetics Study Bible. It also affirms that the \\"Daniel\\" in Ezekiel 14:20 refers to the canonical character, not to the pagan hero in the Ugaritic literature.<br />Why is this such a hard question for the ESV editors?<br /><br />Kudos to Holman.<br /><br />ADDED OCTOBER, 2009:<br /><br />I would now change my rating to 4 stars if I could.  Still concerned about the Dan'el thing, but that shouldn't lead to a three star rating.
1434609723|3.0|Although I appreciate those inspiring folks who believe that the glass is half full, choose to look on the bright side, and see a silver lining in every dark cloud, eleven-year-old Pollyanna takes the concept to an irritatingly higher level. Her businesslike forty-year-old half-namesake aunt Polly who resides in Beldingsville, Vermont, agrees to take on guardianship of the orphaned girl, not out of love but of duty, and relegates her to an uncomfortable, unadorned room. The girl welcomes flies, greets (and eventually befriends) standoffish townspersons, and can think of something good in even the worst situation as a direct result of her adherence to the rules of the \\"just being glad,\\" game that she learned from her father (p 38) \\"the game was just to find something about everything to be glad about-no matter what `twas.\\" Those she befriends quickly jump on the pro-Pollyanna bandwagon. She is slow, however, in transforming her aunt (who forbids her to talk of her father thus learns late of the game) from cool to convert. Pollyanna brightens the world of a bedridden woman, brings out the best in a penny-pinching bachelor, rescues the same man, and helps an orphan boy find a family. And when tragedy strikes, she faces the challenge cheerfully. The book ends as one might expect.<br /><br />Although a positive attitude is admirable, Pollyanna's pleasantness was too much for me. This book might qualify as the book with one of the most distracting words of all time with its repeated use of a dual-meaninged (now rarely used in this context) synonym for \\"exclaim.\\" Better: Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery, Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren and Clarice Bean Don't Look Now by Lauren Child.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Boy, was I shocked. Shocked to learn that this is such a masterpiece of the genre and yet, it took me a long time to finally get to see it. Shocked to see such raw, incredible performances in a movie that ,at the same time, is both disturbingly violent and character driven.<br />This is one of the very best horror films I have seen in the past couple of years; there's no bull here. I wish I had had the chance to see it in the big screen, but as it is, on home entertainment, it's good enough.<br />And to think some people confuse it with that utter mess called 'The Fog'....<br />Give this movie a chance. It's an experience you most likely won't forget.
0312360266|2.0|I read this book because I loved the twilight series and the sookie stackhouse books and this came highly recommended. I am not a YA nor am I a prudish woman but the language even shocked a sailor-mouth such as myself. But I don't think that was what bothered me as much as the fact I felt this was almost the exact same formula as Harry Potter (freaky mark on forehead and all) Also, the authors struggle to sound so much like a teen was extremely irritating....<br />I think for a 15-16 yr old looking for a vampire fix this is a good book. But for an adult looking for a good read steer clear.
0525951113|5.0|A techno-thriller, for all its modernity, is still a form of one of the oldest science-fiction/horror archetypes - Frankenstein complex. This is the fear that a creation of man's will get out of control. \\"Daemon\\" certainly fits the category. And like the technology at its heart, it races along at light-speed, giving you barely time to catch your breath before freezing it in your throat once again. Suarez uses a lot of geek-speak that might bog down some readers, but I found it adds to the realism of the novel. And we can all relate to the all too real threat of computer viruses shutting down networks and compromising our security. Fans of the the \\"Terminator\\" films and books will recognize the similarity of Sobol's daemon to Skynet, but I think you'll find the daemon to be more sophisticated and much more frightening.     Some reviewers expressed disappointment with the ending, but I think you'll find that both the issues Suarez explores in \\"Daemon\\" and its sheer power and malevolence couldn't be resolved in one book. So I'm hooked, and like many of you, I can't wait until the next installment, \\"Freedom\\", is published next year.

B000H5U832|5.0|We watched this as a family last night and I was reminded of how truly funny this movie is.  It really hit home that this is a story about being first--or not being first.  My daughters 3 and 5 have been squabbling about being first out the door, in the door, etc.  But, my older one really understood after watching Cars that that isn't nice.  She realized that it isn't nice when she and her sister act like the green car in the movie.  It was a great way to start talking to her about why it isn't nice to always be first or to push someone out of the way!
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|Magnificent blending of voices and simple but beautiful staging.  Easy on both the ears and the eyes! Very relaxing and inspirational to hear such artistry. A generous number of selections and worth every   cent I paid for it.

This books teaches that we are not giving our mates  what they need in the WAY they need it. Problems may arise not for lack of trying, but because we are trying the wrong things! If both partners read this book, I imagine great things will happen for them.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is easy-to-follow with no tricky footwork.  Jillian keeps me motivated to push myself.  It is obvious I am working every muscle.  I can't believe it only cost me 7.49 thru Amazon.com, while other less desirable and less effective workout DVDs were up to double the cost. I really like the three 20-minute workouts, each divided into three segments, because if you have time, you can do any two in a row. And the fact that they increase in intensity is a great feature.  If you can motivate yourself to workout at home, and a boot-camp-type style appeals to you, buy this one and you'll get quick results!
0756404746|5.0|I was looking for my next fantasy fix in Amazon, when I stumbled upon the Name of the Wind. I'm glad I did. Just an excellent read and very well written. Too often, I feel the quality of writing in fantasy books is overlooked for plot and the details of the world. Not here. As many have said far more eloquently than I, the writing is very readable and does not detract from the story. Being a music lover, I particularly enjoyed his descriptions of music. Wonderful.    As for the story itself, how creative to use the first person perspective to tell a story. I loved it. And the jumping back and forth from present to past was quite effective as well. You are drawn deeper and deeper into the story with this parallel structure. It forces you to keep on reading to unravel all these questions that pop up. I really see the book as several small mysteries. Who is Kvothe, why is he here in the present, what is his past, what is his motivation? What is going on in the present? What and who are the Chandrian? Ahhh, so many questions to be answered.    Another unique aspect of this book, is its gritty reality in dealing with wealth and status. How often does a fantasy character deal with money? Almost never! And yet this is something everybody can relate to in the \\"real\\" world. Rothfuss deals with it perfectly in his world and makes it a tool for commentary. Excellent!     This is not to say that the book is perfect. I agree with many of the reviewers that certain sub-plots were a little overdone. Dialogue is better than most fantasies, but still a little unbelievable. Besides Tolkien, I have yet to find a fantasy book whose dialogue is completely believable even in the context of the fantasy world. But these are trivial shortcomings in an otherwise fine read.    Bottom line is that I am eagerly anticipating the Wise Man's Fear and highly recommend this book for all you fantasy aficionados out there.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is so amazing and Amazon always has the cheapest prices for Blu-rays. Awesome!
0812550757|5.0|I was enthralled with Card's Ender's Game and was wondering where he would go with Ender and whether the sequel would be anywhere near as good as the first one.  To my surprise and amazement Speaker For The Dead was not only just as good but quite possibly better than Ender's Game.  What is even more amazing is to find that this was a much different style of science fiction, altogether different in everything but the writing style.    It was great to see the dichotomy of Ender the Xenocide and the Speaker For The Dead.  We were also treated to a wonderfully dysfunctional family stuck on a planet with no room to grow beyond the fence of their town under a Catholic Charter.  Novinha, Pipo and Libo all deep and honorable characters, each with their own flaws.  The realistic depiction of an alien race in the Piggies, who each have their own great characters such as Rooter, Leaf-Eater and Human.      All of this is within the colorful interaction between alien races, between religion and town, Speaker For The Dead and citizens, Novinha's family and the town.  Card's ability to paint a vivid picture couched in strong emotions within a powerful plot and you have an acclaimed Hugo and Nebula Award winning book.  A definite recommend.    5 stars.
0930289234|5.0|I've never been interested in reading comic books, which is ironic because I watched comic book heroes on TV and in movies, but I never could get myself to read any of the source material.  Because I'm so out of the loop on comics, I didn't know what a turning point the \\"Watchmen\\" series was for the comic book industry until I heard about it on the History Channel.  Now with the movie coming out in March, I thought I'd finally give the source material a try.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It's important to note straight off that these are not your father's comic book heroes.  What \\"Watchmen\\" did when it came out in the mid-80s was to make comic book characters REAL--or as real as can be expected.  The \\"costumed adventurers\\" depicted in the series are not in it for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.  They have varying reasons like psychotic obsessions, family pressure, fame-seeking, or just plain old curiosity.  Most of these \\"heroes\\" might help you if you were being mugged or trapped in a burning building, but don't expect them to help old ladies cross the road or give a lesson on civics to a 3rd grade class.<br /><br />The story begins in 1985, a very different 1985 from what you might remember.  For one thing, Richard Nixon is still president and American won the war in Vietnam thanks to the costumed adventurers, most notably Dr. Manhattan, a god-like being who is blue and pretty much do whatever he wants to matter--including making it disappear.  (Another difference is that thanks to Doc Manhattan electric cars were invented in 1960, thus global warming is not so much of a problem, nor are rising oil prices.)  Only Dr. Manhattan and an aging mercenary known as The Comedian (like a sadistic Captain America) are still allowed to fight evil by working for Uncle Sam.  The rest are all forced into hiding.  Most find other jobs while some, like the obsessive Rorshach, continue to operate at risk of prosecution. (The premise of superheroes being outlawed was later used in the Disney movie \\"The Incredibles.\\")<br /><br />One night, though, The Comedian is found dead in his apartment.  As Rorshach investigates the case, he begins to see a conspiracy at work and not only because he's paranoid.  Someone is out to eliminate or marginalize all the costumed adventurers.  But who and why remains a mystery as the world teeters on the brink of Armageddon with a Soviet incursion into Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Can the \\"heroes\\" find out what's going on and put a stop to it?  With the USA and USSR turn the earth into a radioactive cinder?  Tune in to find out.<br /><br />I have to say, for a comic book (originally published as a series of 12 and now packaged together into a novel) this was fascinating.  It's not just one slugfest after another between heroes and villains.  The narrative not only goes into the mystery and conspiracy, but it delves into the backgrounds of the characters and includes interesting sidebars, notably a comic within the comic about an evil pirate ship of damned souls that makes the Black Pearl seem like a Carnival fun ship.  The comic within the comic fits into one of the overreaching themes of the book, which is: do the ends justify the means?  And as is frequently scrawled on walls in the book:  who watches the watchmen?<br /><br />Unraveling the various complexities and symbolic elements of this would take a long time, and I doubt I could nail them all own.  Suffice it to say if you think comics are kid's stuff then you are dead wrong in this case.  This is a comic for adults with adult situations like rape, impotency, and other stuff you certainly won't see on Saturday morning cartoons.  \\"Watchmen\\" was one of the first books to really focus solely on the adults and revolutionized the industry.  Its influence is still felt today in movies like \\"The Dark Knight\\" that strive for a more realistic approach to those costumed adventurers.<br /><br />That is all.<br /><br />(BTW, as I have no experience with graphic novels there's nothing I can say about the artwork.  I thought it was good, but what do I know?)c novels there's nothing I can say about the artwork.  I thought it was good, but what do I know?)

0743582055|5.0|The Bro Code, as an audio book, is a brilliant thing, indeed. The writing itself is clever and very HIMYM, or--to be more specific--very Barney. Not only does Matt Kuhn (er, Barney) supply readers with ample material to laugh at and enjoy, he also rewards loyal fans with references to things that have occurred throughout the series' colorful seasons. Furthermore, he had me picturing the characters in an array of hilarious new situations that could arise from the ideas presented in The Code. I read the book first and the narration by Neil Patrick Harris makes the many articles of The Code jump off the page. He manages to bring Barney's personality very convincingly to life through voice alone. I would recommend this audio book to all who are fans of the show or simply wish to have a good laugh.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Like so many other fans I had seen the stage play of this musical when it first came out and loved it. However when I saw the movie version it totally blew me away. The whole cast is outstanding allowing the seamless telling of the story.  This movie moves you both deeply and profoundly and those feelings remain with you long after the movie is over. It is Gerard Butler's magnificent performance as the Phantom that accomplishes this. He is all at once dark, dangerous, sensuous, sexy, tortured, tormented and oh so human. His singing so full of raw emotion and passion moves my very soul and is not to be missed. The music through out the whole movie is lush and powerful and stays with you so you may wish to order the soundtrack when you get the movie. Though do keep in mind that this is a very tragic story of great love and loss, betrayal of that love and of sacrifice for that love, so do keep a box of kleenex handy. Make that a large box of kleenex if you relate to the Phantoms' heartbreak and pain, which I think is a given based on Gerard Butler's amazing potrayal of the Phantom. I still cry every time I watch this movie and I am well on my way to triple digits for the number of times I have watched it and to me it is still just as magnificent and haunting as the very first time I saw it. I would buy the 2 disc special widescreen edition if for no other reason than the deleted scene \\"No One Would Listen\\" it is as beautiful as it is sad.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original TV series and purchased this item to prepare for the movie coming out in 2009. My boyfriend had never seen the show and he was not familiar at all, so he needed some education! He loves it now, too. :)<br /><br />The set itself is very beautiful. Each transparent/silver box houses one season of the series. The artwork on the outside (photos of key characters, the Enterprise, etc) are very high-quality. Inside the plastic box there is a cardboard sleeve. Inside the cardboard sleeve is a multi-disk booklet holding all of the episodes. There are plastic info cards for each disk, which are lovely, but I don't know what to do with them. They do not slide in anywhere that I can find, and there is no front cover to the booklet with the disks, so I can't just sandwich them in with their respective disk... So I don't know about those. The disks themselves are dual-sided (HD on one side, Standard on the other) and are identified on the center. Sufficient, but not beautiful.<br /><br />The menus are great! Each disk opens in the transporter room, and key characters/events appear on the transporter. It's cool. :) You make your episode selection from the transporter control panel. Also cool. There is a special feature/video on each disk. I'm not that into special features, so those don't really mean much to me.<br /><br />The quality of the episodes themselves are PHENOMENAL. Everything is GLORIOUS. The remastering of the special effects is done with perfection. There is no classic Star Trek charm lost at all, and the newly animated Enterprise fills my heart with joy. :) I am so pleased to see it sliding through space, orbiting planets, and shooting those phasers in three-dimensional glory. Fantastic. Don't think for a moment that \\"remastered\\" means \\"unfamiliar\\" or \\"foreign\\" or even \\"surprising.\\" If the original creators could have done it this way, used this technology,... they would have. It's beautiful.<br /><br />Five stars! Cool packaging, cool menus, better-than-perfect video quality. Well worth what I payed on Amazon.com.ideo quality. Well worth what I payed on Amazon.com.

B0012GUI08|5.0|This edition of Kafka's monumental 'The Castle' reproduces the left over fragments and deleted sequences that Max Brod produced after Kafka's death. It marks the most complete presentation of this great work since its original release. 'The Castle' contains Kafka's most haunting and wonderful qualities: a nightmarish psychological intensity paired with a satirical slaying of modernity. It involves a man named K who is commissioned as a 'Land Surveyor' at a Castle who must make his way without friends or allies. As he proceeds, he is thrust into an irrational universe of arbitrary rules and punishments, where there is both a callous indifference to the needs of man and a pious respect of absurdity and authority. Kafka was perhaps the most successful writer to represent the metaphysical and psychological darkness of our era through an investigation of the material world. His genius is both nuanced and expansive. Do not miss this supreme masterpiece.
1881273156|5.0|My husband and I bought this book because we clearly weren't communicating clearly to one another. We cheated and went to the back of the book took the test and just from that we understood what our issues were. So then we read the rest and it has been fun since! Thank you very good book and I would highly recommened it.
B001ED7C58|4.0|This is a nicely done soundtrack. \\"Never Think\\" is beautiful, and sounds like Edward speaking his thoughts to Bella (especially if you've read Midnight Sun) I do wish \\"Let Me Sign\\" had made it in there, but is seems better for New Moon...
B00006LPER|2.0|A cold, emotionally-repressed piano teacher under the thumb of a domineering mother finds release in a variety of inappropriate, unhealthy ways, including peeping into the car window of a young couple being intimate at a drive-in movie and smelling dirty tissues from the trash can of a porn shop video booth.  Apologies for being so graphic, but potential viewers should be alerted about what they're getting here.  Eventually, the teacher's actions escalate from the inappropriate and mildly criminal activities described to psychotic episodes including the maiming of one of her students.<br /><br />To be fair, the movie is well acted, somewhat interesting, and never becomes boring (the worst sin of a creative work, in my opinion), but in the end the unpleasantness, grossness and endless depressing scenes outweigh the artistic value of the piece, making the film an ordeal to finish.  Obviously, other reviewers here on Amazon feel differently, but this is my take.  And, if you check out my other reviews, you'll see that I don't need a film to be light and feel-good to enjoy it.<br /><br />There's a twenty-minute interview with actress Isabelle Huppert on the DVD, where she says that the crux of the film is the main character's desire to be loved in an old-fashioned way (\\"like something out of a nineteenth century novel\\") in a world where men only want to seduce her.  \\"Really?\\" I said to myself, \\"but how does that explain her desire to be tied up and beaten, as well as the premeditated criminal maiming of her student?\\"  I guess I've gotten out of practice with French cinema from the days when I used to enjoy Truffaut films.
0385512058|5.0|It's remarkable, really, that so many people still think of networking as shaking hands at a business event. After reading Keith's book, I remember one night, while waiting line at the parking garage, everyone was silent, so I struck up a conversation with the guy behind me - and it was amazing.  Everyone in line had thought the networking time was \\"over\\" - and yet we made a far more powerful connection because it was memorable.  And that's what you need to take away from Never Eat Alone - you may not become fast-friends with everyone you meet, but when you reach out, people appreciate it!  Today I have my own communications consulting firm, work with Fortune 500 clients, and have two best selling business books, \\"Speak Like a CEO,\\" and \\"Motivate Like a CEO.\\"  Keith is the real deal - it's really all about building relationships - one at a time!

1932907009|5.0|This book has gotten me re-excited about writing!  It is geared to those who want to SELL their screenplay.  That's what a spec script is.  It's not pointed to those who want to make art or shoot their own script.  People who want to be Chris Nolan or MNS or the Coens will need a production book.  Having said that, Save the Cat expresses things that are theory into layman terms so neophytes can get started and excited about writing.    Also, he puts his email address in the book.  Don't be afraid to write!  Blake's very helpful.    Thanks Snyder!
B001KVZ6BG|4.0|Slumdog is electrifying. Everything works. The sheer sense of that part of the world that Danny shows us through his minds eye, is ravishing. Ultra stylish even in the slums, somehow he makes trash seem delictable. The colors that bounce off one another are truly remarkable, again everything works. The music, the pace, the editing is beyond amazing, and should garner an Oscar, needless to say the storyline is brilliant, the actors, even the kids through the years, are just so well done, and the transition from stage to stage is not clumsy, it flows very, very well. I can't find anything wrong with this movie. The score is tangible to every scene. In a year full of odd releases, and surprises, I am so glad a movie like this can come along, in the dead of winter, and remind us that filmmaking is indeed that lavish creativity that a rare few still know how to accomplish with percision and make us enjoy shelling ten dollars to go back to the theatre.<br /><br />I remember Danny B when he was no one, dont-cha hate it when they become a household name, :)<br /><br />Go See it!
0060558121|5.0|I remember waiting a long time for this book.  Neil documented the process of writing it on his blog, so every few days I would get a little glimpse at what he was doing - and it drove me nuts.  Living in Japan, I can never be sure when my favorite entertainment will make it over here.  Movies and books can take months to get from the US to Japan, and while I'm waiting not-so-patiently, all my friends at home have just devoured it and are in the process of raving about how awesome it is.  Oh, sure, the hyper-sellers like Harry Potter might have a worldwide release, but Neil wasn't exactly a mainstream superstar when this was written.<br /><br />So yes, one of my main memories associated with this book is frustration.  Fortunately, when I picked up the book during a trip home back in 2001, my frustration was erased and replaced with profound satisfaction.<br /><br />American Gods was one of Gaiman's first full-length novels, though I may be wrong about that.  It was not, of course, his debut - he had made his name a household world in fantasy-reading households by penning the epic comic book series Sandman, in which he proved that he was able to marry huge metaphysical themes to personal narrative.  He could make the dissolution of worlds pale beside a broken heart and make you believe that even the simplest of life had vast meaning.<br /><br />In other words, this man has some serious writing chops.<br /><br />As the title implies, in this book Gaiman takes on the gods, and asks a very interesting - and important - question: what happened to the gods that came to America?  I'm talking about the Old Gods, the gods that had been living in the hearts and minds of people for thousands of years.  Leprechauns and dryads, three-in-one forces of fate and representations of the seasons.  Easter and Odin, Bast and Anubis, gods of once-great nations and unknown villages.  As their people came to America over the millennia, they brought their gods with them.<br /><br />But as the people stayed in America, they changed.  They grew.  And the gods discovered that America is not a good place for them.<br /><br />Now the old gods are small and unworshipped, save by a few tiny, dwindling pockets of their old culture.  What's more, new gods are rising, gods of media and internet, highway and television and government.  And, as has been said in countless westerns and cowboy movies, there isn't room for all of them.  There will be a reckoning, and a man named Shadow is in the middle of it.<br /><br />Shadow is a convict, nearly at the end of his time in prison.  He wants nothing more than to get out of prison and rejoin his wife.  He gets one of those wishes when he is released early.  Unfortunately, he is released early to attend his wife's funeral.<br /><br />Without friends or family, Shadow is aimless and alone.  It is in this condition that he meets the enigmatic Wednesday, a man who seems to know Shadow and his situation, far better than any stranger should.  He offers Shadow a job - to assist Wednesday when he needs it, protect him if he has to, and sit a vigil for him if he dies.  With nothing to lose, Shadow accepts the deal.  In so doing, he finds himself facing a war of gods that he never knew existed.<br /><br />It's a great story, on many levels.  In one sense, it's a love letter to America.  Shadow's journey takes him through small towns that have yet to be subsumed into the ever-devouring maw of the modern American monoculture - from roadside attractions to tiny motels to strange lakeside communities, the unacknowledged weirdness of America is put on display here for all to see.  As is its history, in the form of flashbacks to the journeys that people made from their homelands to this land, voluntary or not.  The book reminds us that there is a complexity to not only American history, but also to American culture, which gets lost in the ubiquity of McDonald's and Starbucks.<br /><br />The metaphysical angle of this book is also something to give you pause.  It asks the questions about what gods are, how they're born and how they die.  Most importantly - how they flourish or wither, and why.  It is said over and over again that America is a bad place for gods, although it's not clearly explained why.  Perhaps something to do with its geography - a vast, variable landscape that's too big for small tribal gods to get a hold of.  Perhaps it's the people, brought from all over the world, who can't help but wonder what other cultures can offer them.  Perhaps it's just the nature of its people - always moving, independently-minded.  The old gods, who were gods of small nations and regions, simply didn't have the power or flexibility to stay on.<br /><br />Which really makes us wonder, how did capital-g God manage to get a foothold? As one of the characters notes, Jesus has done really well over here.  Perhaps because the God of Abraham can be all things to all people - a god of vengeance and justice, a god of mercy and love, a creator, a destroyer, a personal friend or a distant observer.  There is something to be said for non-specialization, I suppose....<br /><br />This book is a journey, and it's a long and complicated one at that.  But it's enjoyable and personal.  Gaiman writes with great empathy, so that the reader may even understand the gods themselves, as reduced and attenuated as they may have become.  Though Shadow is not exactly the protagonist of the story - he spends most of the book doing what he is told to do, only taking initiative on his own towards the end, he is observant.  Through his eyes, we learn more about America.  Its triumphs, its flaws and its potential all become a little bit clearer, and upon finishing the book, those of us from that strange, turbulent land can perhaps appreciate it a bit more.born and how they die.

1932907009|5.0|There are rules that apply to everything. We do not build a house without some type of plan. We construct houses and buildings on solid foundations and the framework is not aimlessly slapped together, but designed to meet in ways that provide maximum support, strength and durability. And, these are fundamental laws that cannot be ignored in order to truly design something worthwhile. And it's everywhere and in everything around us.     When these rules are understood and mastered they do not restrict you, but free you. They open you up to be as creative as you want to be; to go as far as you can, be as amazing and unbelievable as possible and have the structure to support it all. These rules cannot be ignored, so embrace them.     What Blake does is teach you how to design the infrastructure that allows you the support your story. The beats provide you a fundamental design that propels your story in a manner that allows you the freedom to be as creative and as effective as possible.     Although, hard to believe and sometimes harder conform to the beats. Every step and every beat has made my story better and me a more effective storyteller. I am inspired and grateful.     Thank again, Blake.
0399246665|5.0|These books are so cool. I bought them for Christmas for my 3 year old daughter and she wants me to read them all the time. What we really like is that instead of just reading it to her, it can be somewhat interactive.  The pages of the book are split so there's the top section and the bottom section. \\"Numbers\\" for example, will have the number 1 on top with 1 block, then on the bottom she'll find the page that only has 1 banana.  The pages are thick and sturdy so no need to worry about it getting ripped up!
B00004C4L6|5.0|The album \\"Electronic Meditation (1970)\\" by Tangerine Dream ranks among the first great Krautrock albums. The fierceness of \\"Electronic Meditations,\\" and heavy drumming, would later be seen in bands like Faust, Neu!, and Suicide.  This album brought the fierce drone front and center, which would later become enhanced by the use of synthesizers.  The drumming on this album reminds me of the drumming heard on Can's later albums.  Also, you have heavy use of synthesiers.  The music sounds like a much fiercer, more drum heavy version of the album \\"A Saucerful of Secrets (1968)\\" by Pink Floyd.
0060934913|5.0|I decided to read the book after watching No Reservations because frankly the man interests me. He's got a fast-paced writing style, seems to come up with stories out of nowhere--on any topic at all, he's witty and very funny; at times he is self-deprecating in his humor, which I took as humbleness. This is definitely an interesting read; it is the book that put Bourdain out there for the world to see, and there's no wonder that he has gained the notorious gourmand-meets-bad boy reputation that you see on TV once you learn about his adventurous and entertaining experiences while gaining some knowledgeable insight on who he is as a person.
B00005TPKD|5.0|The album \\"Phallus Dei (1969)\\" by Amon Duul II is the first Krautrock masterpiece.      Amon Duul II - a band living as a commune! - took Pink Floyd's \\"Saucerful of Secrets (1968)\\" to the next level, in one instance by adding more \\"world music\\" elements.      The album \\"Phallus Dei\\" and \\"Monster Movie (1969)\\" by Can are arguably the first Krautrock albums, although I am leaning towards considering \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" by Pink Floyd to be the first krautrock album, and the first of the British progressive rock albums too.      The first Krautrock masterpieces are: (1) \\"Monster Movie (1969)\\" by Can, (2) \\"Phallus Dei (1969)\\" by Amon Duul II, (3) \\"Electronic Meditation (1970)\\" by Tangerine Dream, and (4) \\"Yeti (1970)\\" by Amon Duul II.      Phallus Dei is a masterpiece.  Certainly the first masterpiece in a string of great Krautrock and Berlin School albums to follow.

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Clint Eastwood's \\"Grand Torino\\" and thought it was a pretty solid and emotional movie. Mr. Eastwood is a veteran in Hollywood movies, as you can tell. His acting is just excellent and each movie, he plays his part well. Like in this movie, he plays as a grumpy old man (in his 70's), who is an ex-war veteran living in Michigan, who unfortunately lost his wife. An Asian family moves in next door, and he ends up making a bond with them, despite their differences.<br /><br />My opinion of this movie is that the acting by all characters is great. I think that the movie is sort of stereotypical at times such as when the old guy calls the Asians every name in the book (i.e. \\"Gooks\\"), or like when he punks some black kids who tries to take the Asian girl (and the person she was walking with). I understand that the setting of the movie is here in 2008/2009, so there is a lot of common ground here (some people may say it's for the better).<br /><br />Overall Eastwood directed a great movie, as him playing the main character, and teaching a young boy how to live for himself. This is one movie I would recommend anyone to see, because it is very interesting. Peace.<br /><br />P.S.- Did anyone else notice one of the Asian thug kids (the chubby one with short hair) has two thumbs on one of his hands, or was that just me?
0634049011|5.0|I bought this book about two years ago and went through all the exercises. I have a much better understanding of how to compose chords, how play arpeggios, and have gained  much better understanding of scales. In essence, this book has been the foundation of music for me. I liked how the author presents the material and later I bought his \\"Chord-Tone Soloing\\" and \\"Music Theory\\" books. I am very analytical and found these books to be clear, practical, and very informative.

This technical aspect of the book was well balanced with the moving account of her recovery and her personal, emotional experience as a patient.    The writing style is a little labored, but this didn't detract too much from my overall enjoyment.    As well as reading the book I also watched the four episodes of Oprah's Spirit Channel with Jill Bolte Taylor and I found that these helped me understand the book a little better.  These are available at [...] and are in the second season of her free Spirit Channel webcasts.    Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about strokes, especially if someone in your family has had a stroke and needs care.
0061139378|5.0|I had ordered this book long ago when on a whim I was determined to get all of Gaiman's books.  I noticed that it was a childrens book so I mentally filed it away.  When I saw the advertisements for the movie... I knew that with a 7 year old I would have to watch the film and ripped the book off the shelf to make sure I'd read it before watching the film.<br /><br />How weird it all is... I read it in just about a half an hour or so... and it was creepy.  Little Coraline is bored... both of her parents work at home, but they are always busy with work and rarely have time to play with her.  She wanders about their house (a flat converted from a much larger house) and visits with the neigbors.  Even when she is visiting with the neighbors, they don't seem to really notice her, everyone talks at Coraline rather than to her.  She enjoys exploring and eventually comes across a door in her flat that opens to a brick wall.  Her mother explaines that it used to be a door that went into the neighboring flat, but now it's bricked up in case they rent it out.<br /><br />Suddenly strange things crawl through the night, and a door that once lead to a wall of bricks, opens to a long dark hallway... to a world disturbingly similar to the one she just left... only with frightening and sinister undertones.  Coraline shows her strength, intelligence, cunning and determination to find not only her parents, but also to get back home.<br /><br />As an adult I thought to myself - this book will scare the crapola out of little ones!  In the back Gaiman states that the book was frightening to adults and an exciting adventure to children.  Perplexed, I handed it off to my 7 year old... expecting it to look as though it had been through a chipper shredder when handed back to me.  Much to my surprise... not only did he read it, but there were no nightmares... he was thrilled with it and can't wait for the movie.  I'm still perplexed as to how this book brings out such completely different emotions in children and adults.  I don't know that the movie will be able to pull it off... I have a hunch that the movie might encourage leaving the light in the hallway on at night.<br /><br />Still... if you are an adult, don't let that stop you from reading this wonderful book.  I wouldn't compair it to Narnia other than a door opens into another world.  Think of it more like Alice in Wonderland... and not the Disney version either... or The Wizard of Oz, focused on the scenes with the flying monkeys and the witch.<br /><br />Highly recommended, excellent novel.dults.

0316017922|4.0|Having read his previous 2 books I pretty much knew what to expect from this one with respect to writing style.  Gladwell's books are well written, very easy to read, and short.  He lays out his thesis through a series of anecdotes, almost a set of magazine articles, which labor the point a little too long.  Each anecdote is supported by data, but not to the point of overwhelming the reader, and certainly not \\"comprehensive\\" data on the topic.    I think that many of the media reviews of this book are somewhat unfair. He's not saying that talent or hard work don't matter. But he is suggesting  that success and genius are not quite what we think they are in the popular perception.  He's suggesting that by re-examining how we select, stream, train and educate those with exceptional innate talents we could likely make better use of those talents and bring more of them to a much higher level.  Good for them, good for us.    If you want lots of data on the topic then this isn't the book for you, nor is it if you get bored with his stories (I confess I was getting a little bored toward the end).  But if you want a good, quick, easy read that will provide you with some fascinating information and with some food for thought, then this really provides an enjoyable few hours.

0307346617|5.0|While vampires have been done to death (or un-death) in fiction, zombies have not nearly been as represented in horror literature.  I believe it has to do with the type of fear that zombies evoke:  on the most basic level, zombie stories are tales of claustrophobia, with characters being trapped in increasingly smaller spaces.  That works well in a movie, but it is harder in a book.  Although I'm sure there are other examples, I can only think of two major zombie books, Richard Matheson's I Am Legend and Stephen King's The Cell (technically, the monsters in both books are not zombies, but they are similar enough to be considered zombie stories).    Make that three books:  Max Brooks's World War Z is right up there with the other two, and while King's book is decent, Brooks's is better.  Despite the lack of any main characters or a real plot, World War Z is top-notch, even more exceptional when you consider that Brooks (unlike Matheson or King) has little in the way of other big writing credits.    The book is a look back at the title event, in which classic zombies (slow-moving, mindless flesh-eaters who spread through biting and can only be killed by destroying their brains) spread throughout the world, wreaking incredible havoc until they were eventually vanquished (no spoiler here; the human victory is mentioned in the introduction).    Brooks's successful gimmick is to treat this as an oral history, obviously modeled after Studs Terkel's The Good War.  Various characters relate the events in the Zombie War, from onset through victory.  Sections deal with various phases, such as the early days when few were clear on what was going on, through the Great Panic in which humanity almost perished and the eventual rallying back from the brink.  The book comes off like a collection of related short stories, almost all of which are entertaining.    I suppose that at first, I thought this was going to be a humorous book, based on Brooks's pedigree (he is the son of Mel Brooks).  It becomes clear soon, however, that while this novel has a satirical edge, it does belong in the horror genre.  Along with I Am Legend, World War Z is the definitive zombie novel:  while the former deals with things on a personal level, the latter takes a more global approach.  Being compared to Matheson is high praise, but World War Z deserves it.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Having never seen The Biggest Loser (and only a slight knowledge of what the show even was) I bought this DVD on recommendation and great reviews. There were some great things about it, and some not so great.    Pros:  -The workout keeps you interested. With the constant changes it was a nice, new routine.  -Well produced, high quality (especially compared to some other fitness DVDs out there)  -Jillian emphasizes the need to WORK. Results don't just happen. It was nice to finally have a DVD where the instructor was honest about how to get results.    Cons:  -Found the level too easy. There are 3 levels on this DVD. In the first week I did all three levels and it was not until level 3 that I started to feel a challenge.  -Wish there was an option to do the workout without sound. Jillian does this boot camp style, and there are days where you just don't care to hear \\"you should be gargling your heart at the end of this workout\\".  -Not challenging for those who already work out regularly. This would however be a great way to kick start your fitness regime if you are new to fitness or are just getting back to it.  -Not enough cardio. When I was done this workout, I found I still craved a run.    Final thoughts: It's nice to have around for when I want to mix up my routine, but I don't use it regularly nor would I recommend it for regular use. This DVD serves as a great kick start, not for long term fitness maintenance.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|This is album is more political but it still rocks. Eddie's gravelly voice is more vigorous than ever. He rages on songs like \\"World Wide Suicide\\" and \\"Life Wasted\\" in a vehement, torturous way. He portray his convictions with raw emotions also some tender soul. The harmonizing is impecable between Stone and Mike. They sound as fresh today as when the first time they came on the scene. You can't get a better band than Pearl Jam. Their just perfect.
B00005NOOH|2.0|Many of the documentaries are very well done but there is an overall theme that the British won the war with a little help from everyone else.    The Pacific War - along with Pearl Harbor were very disapointing.  Also the constant overtheme that the Americans were there enjoying themselves more than fighting and sacrificing was rather insulting.  Some great documentaries, but if you want to see anything about the American involvement - buy something else.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The best movie of 2008. Excellent casting,amazing writing,haunting music. It had it all. Ledger(R.I.P.)gave one of his best unbelieveable performances. He was just insane,truly twisted,incredibly smart lunatic. I loved him. Christopher Nolan just raised the bar in comic book movies and the studios need to sit up and take notice. The man is brillant. It was just a powerful,intense rollercoaster of a movie. You need to check it out.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Lots of moody,psychadelic,music. Maynard's mystical, musical stylings sounding very haunting and moving especially when he's singing on \\"Right in Two\\". His voice sounds so beautiful. They are some soundscapes songs on there like \\"Lost Keys\\" which is great for just relaxing too because they so soothing. The harmonizing with the instruments is just phenomenal. The way Danny plays his drums is out of this world. I really do believe he's alien. That's what makes them so different and sound like nobody esle. They are truly unique.

B00006BTCA|5.0|A moody, indie rock, dark,intelligent masterpiece. I love Paul's voice. It's so deep and passionate. He just brings an air of sophistication and of course lots of drama with his complicated relationships. If you like somber,melodramatic music that is not boring,this is for you.
0451529308|4.0|I decided to reread Little Women before reading the Pulitzer Prize-winning March by Geraldine Brook, which is written from the viewpoint of the family's father, off serving as a Chaplain during the Civil War.<br /><br />As always happens, as I read a favorite children's book as an adult, I find things that I love to be reminded of, but also notice how many life messages simply slipped past me during the early reading. There are some great life lessons about marriage and relationships, especially after a child is added to the mix, for example.<br /><br />There were certainly aspects of the book that come across a bit too sweet and cloying, but those are balanced by the images of a young girl Jo (and her mother Marmee) stepping out a bit from the controlling and limiting expectations on women of the time.<br /><br />I read the book now from the viewpoint of a military spouse who has also watched my husband deploy into a war zone. I also do many workshops for military spouses dealing with the current deployments so I know what they deal with. My first reaction was that the March family and mother especially had it pretty good in comparison. They have a fulltime maid Hannah for one thing, something that any military spouse would give a lot to  have! But many of the emotions, thoughts and fears of current military spouses are matched in this book (and even more so in March).<br /><br />All in all a great read, a nice view into a totally different time in our history -- now I want to watch the movie again!<br />Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help! I'm a Military Spouse -- I Get a Life Too! 2d Edition
0316017922|5.0|To fully communicate how I felt while reading this book, let me first describe how I felt watching the movie The Sixth Sense. If you haven't seen the movie, it's one of the classic surprise endings of our time. Just before they reveal the plot twist, they do a little montage of earlier scenes that contained hints at the surprise. During the montage, I figured out what they were building towards (and I'm not bragging here. I think that was the intended movie-goer experience). For a brief moment, I couldn't believe I missed all the cues and failed to guess what will surely be an obvious conclusion when I watch the movie a second time.    Reading Malcom Gladwell's book gave me several aha moments. I looked back on my life and I couldn't believe the implications of simple little events until I saw them replayed in his examples. I would recommend this book to anybody who is trying to reinvent themselves or who will be raising children.    My only complaint is not in the book itself, but in how I have seen the author promote the book. He claims he is exploding the myth of the self-made man popularly associated with the American dream. His candid comments completely ignore half of his book. In every case he studies, the subject was incredibly lucky, being in the right time and place to become and outlier. He talks about this finding invalidating the myth of great figures of history working hard to attain their dreams, and yet, at least half the book is dedicated to explaining that the Outliers have put in 10,000 hours of practice to become experts in their fields.    None the less, I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I discussed it with other people as the read it after I did. I found myself biting my tongue to avoid revealing spoilers. I think it's great to read a non-fiction book, and think about it having \\"spoilers.\\"
B0010ZR160|5.0|Casey Affleck more than holds his own in scenes with Morgan Freeman and the underrated Ed Harris in almost as surprising a way as Tom Cruise did with Dustin Hoffman in \\"Rain Man.\\" Just a super movie from start to finish with each actor in each scene bringing something to the table. Ed Harris has the meatiest role next to Casey as a is he a bad guy or good guy and that conundrum is revisited with many of the characters in this story. Ben Affleck does a superb job in his directorial debut, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.
B001F0VHEM|2.0|I was so excited to see that Pink finally had a new album out and thoroughly enjoyed her previous work. I, like everyone else, has heard \\"So What\\" numerous times on the radio and figured that Pink was finally back to her old self. By listening to \\"So What\\" especially with it being the first song on the CD thought it was going to be all about her new life and \\"new attitude\\". I could not have been more wrong. While the other songs were nice, it was not at all what I expected and was more like a trip through her sadness and depression over ex. It was too much pity party and not enough rock or fun.

B0017ANAZO|4.0|The Women is a chick flick; there is no use denying it.  But I am surprised that so many did not enjoy it; I unabashedly did.  I thought that Meg Ryan did a credible job in this movie and I enjoyed the cast tremendously.  Love Annette Bening, Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergen.  Ms. Bergen almost ran away with the film; she was so good.  Meg's daughter in the movie (India Ennenga) did an outstanding job as the little girl who is almost forgotten and ignored when Mom becomes absorbed with her own emotions and loss of self esteem.<br /><br />A little bit of Eckart Tolle finds its way into the movie in the form of some of the spirituality messages which abound in his book The Power of Now.  Meg Ryan asks herself finally, \\"What Do You Want?\\"  Easy enough question to ask; but very hard to answer when you have forgotten what you wanted in the first place out of life and submerged your own goals and aspirations in lieu of what your family or successful spouse wanted to achieve.<br /><br />At a deeper level, I think the movie discusses admirably how women can take a detour and lose their self esteem while bolstering their family, children and others.  Many times they do not take the time to take some selfish interest in their own needs, desires and goals and they sadly lose their way in life.  Another subliminal message deals with marriage and the importance of keeping the relationship alive by focusing on being happy with yourself and what you bring to the relationship.  Friendship and betrayal of trust are also front and center; and when a person becomes fearful or pushed to the wall; how loyal and trustworthy would they be?  Would you sell out your friendship or your ideals to hold a job or to advance yourself or to save your own neck?<br /><br />At a psychological and spiritual level, I think the movie really works.  It examines those motivations and life events that many women just take for granted and/or ignore.  Many times women think that what happens in break-ups or marital conflict only happens to other people next door or other family members; until it hits home.  This is very much a story of how a woman picks up the pieces and gets to know herself and exactly what she wants out of life and from herself.<br /><br />I liked the movie; I love Meg Ryan and Candy Bergen; it was a very entertaining film and it may hit close to home; more than you might expect.  And there is always Bette Midler thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />And the trick question: There was only one male in the entire movie; who was it?  You may overlook it if you are not careful!  And if you only get one thing from the movie; if you actually start thinking about what you really want; the time spent will not be wasted; but very well worth it and even enjoyable!  There are many good laughs in this film; and everyone can learn to even hate Crystal Allen (the beautiful Eva Mendes who is the ole spritzer gal).<br /><br />Bentley/2009only happens to other people next door or other family members; until it hits home.

B001HN697C|4.0|Anyone who has seen the previous movies in the Underworld series will be pleased with this prequel.  It competently adds flare to the story, and fills in details that do nothing but accentuate the action and plot of the Underworld timeline.<br /><br />Covens of vampires were once the dominant species.  They were the upper tier in a social structure that placed humans as secondary, and werewolves, animals incapable of controlling their transformation to and from human form, as wild, untamed beasts.  When Lucian (Michael Sheen) was born, however, he became a new breed, a missing link between human and werewolf, a sentient being capable of reason as well as controlling transformation; he was the first Lycan.<br /><br />Eventually, Lucian is thought of as a hybrid pet/soldier.  The vampires' great plan, in large part due to their leader Viktor (Bill Nighy), is to utilize the Lycans as soldiers, intelligent guard dogs.  When Lucian and his brethren grow weary of their third-class status - not to mention Lucian's budding romance with Viktor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) - rebellion is afoot.  And by rebellion I mean all out war, bloody battle, beheadings and deadly accurate mega-crossbows that create Lycan-skewers.  The sword combat comprises the majority of the inter-species hostility.  Each vampire carries an Arthurian demeanor as they kill and decapitate with Claymores and Zweihanders, while showing nothing but stoic countenance.  The Lycans' fighting style, on the other hand, is more visceral, nearly feral, as they attack with ferociousness verging on animal instinct.<br /><br />Aside from the nonstop action that comprises the majority of this film, the underlying tones of racial and social status are perhaps the most powerful.  All the vampires are ghostly white, with overtly beautiful features.  The werewolves are clearly the darker species - growling, snarling, mindlessly rampaging.  In the racial middle are the Lycans - humans make up the social middle - determined to rise above their imprisonment, their slavery, and prove their equivalence.<br /><br />All vampire aficionados will love this movie.  It's dark, foreboding, and saturated with violence, despite missing some of the orthodox vampire lore.  The lighting and coloring are superb, dark blues complimenting the castles, forests, and cave dwellings of the socially inequal species.  Additionally, the connection to the other movies is seamless.  Great addition to the series.mprisonment, their slavery, and prove their equivalence.    All vampire aficionados will love this movie.

1401309666|5.0|Note: The review that follows is of the revised and updated edition of a book that was first published in 2006. It offers essentially the same information and insights except that Anderson has added a new chapter on marketing, one in which he explains \\"how to sell where `selling' doesn't work.\\" More about this chapter later.<br /><br />In the October 2004 issue of Wired magazine, Chris Anderson published an article in which he shared these observations: \\"(1) the tail of available variety is far longer than we realize; (2) it's now within reach economically; (3) all those niches, when aggregated, can make up a significant market - seemed indisputable, especially backed up with heretofore unseen data.\\" That is even truer today than it was when The Long Tail was first published years ago. The era that Anderson characterizes as \\"a market of multitudes\\" continues to grow in terms of both its nature and extent. In this book, Anderson takes his reader on a guided tour of this market as he explains what the probable impact the new market will have and what will be required to prosper in it.<br /><br />According to Anderson, those who read the article saw the Long Tail everywhere, from politics to public relations, and from sheet music to college sports. \\"What people intuitively grasped was that new efficiencies in distribution, manufacturing, and marketing were changing the definition of what was commercially viable across the board. The best way to describe these forces is that they are turning unprofitable customers, products, and markets into profitable ones.\\" Therefore, the story of the Long Tail is really about the economics of abundance: \\"what happens when the bottlenecks that stand between supply and demand in our culture start to disappear and everything becomes available to everyone.\\"<br /><br />If I understand Anderson's most important points (and I may not), they include these:<br /><br />1. Make as much as possible available to as many people as possible.<br />2. Help them to locate what they need, quickly and easily.<br />3. Offer maximum inventory only online.<br />4. Customize supply chain in terms of niche markets<br />5. Maximize its efficiencies and economies (especially inventory control, order processing, and distribution,)<br />5. Be customer-driven in terms of \\"crowdsourcing\\"<br />6. Have strategy that separates content into its component parts (i.e. \\"microchunking\\")<br />7. Have a pricing strategy that is \\"elastic\\" (i.e. based on the ROI of fulfillment per product per niche).<br />8. Have an open source business model for information sharing.<br />9. In markets where scarcity exists, \\"guesstimate\\" costs, margins, sales, profits, etc.<br />10.Where there is abundant competition, let those markets \\"sort it all out.\\"<br /><br />These and other points can guide and inform decision makers as they struggle to compete profitably during the era of \\"long-tailed distributions,\\" when culture is unfiltered by economic scarcity and high technology is turning mass markets into millions of niches. Anderson provides invaluable advice with regard to how minimize the cost of reaching, penetrating, and then developing a multiple of niche markets. The paradigm has shifted from selling more in fewer markets to selling less in more markets but also, key point, selling as much as possible within as many segments as possible -- and prudent -- within those markets.<br /><br />With regard to the new chapter, Anderson devotes much of his attention to online marketing and suggests that critical issues to address include these:<br /><br />Who's influential \\"in our space (and how we know)\\"<br />Who/what influences them<br />How to get Digged<br />Effective blogging<br />Using beta-test invite lists<br />The art of begging for links<br />\\"Link bait\\" (e.g. stunts, contests, gimmicks, memes)<br /><br />How to view the Web? \\"Forget it as a marketplace of products, and instead think of it as a marketplace of opinion. It's the great leveler of marketing. It allows for niche products to get global attention. Most products will be sold offline, as they always were. But in years to come, more and more products will be marketed online, taking advantage of Web methods to fine-slice consumer groups and influence word of mouth more effectively than ever before in history. Not all industries lend themselves to an infinite variety of products, but all industries have an infinite variety of customers. Finally we can treat them like the individuals they are. It's the sunset of the thirty-second spot.\\"<br /><br />There are several reasons why Anderson believed there is a need for a revised and updated edition. Here are two. Because the earlier version became a bestseller, it attracted lots of attention, generating an abundance of discussion of his core concepts. Also, the process of adopting his ideas (many of which at first seemed counterintuitive, if not precious and naive) was complicated by the globalization of culture. Focus shifted to distributed audiences around the world. Anderson was asked for additional examples of Long Tail effects outside the digital realms of media and entertainment. He certainly could not cover all of the extensions in fashion, travel, organic and \\"artisanal\\" food, and even alcohol as indicated by -- to cite one example -- Anheuser-Busch's embrace of niche beers, the establishment of Long Tail Libations, and the increased number of beers from 26 brands in 1997 to 80 in 2007. Given the fact that change continues to be the only constant in the global business world, think of this revised and updated edition as only the latest update on some Long Tail developments thus far.<br /><br />Presumably the tail will continue to lengthen in months and years to come.s were.

B001DPHDCY|5.0|My grand daughter received Horton Hears a Who as a Christmas gift from me. She has enjoyed very much watching the movie.
0452286751|5.0|I like a book that can make me think, but mostly I like a book that will keep me entertained. The thing about authors with big ideas is that at some point they forget that they're authors and start thinking their sole purpose is to enlighten humanity. This must have happened to Rand after she finished this book, because Atlas Shrugged (her later work) was preachy and almost started to feel like a chore once I got halfway through.    The Fountainhead is a novel and it doesn't forget what it is. It is rapidly paced, with interesting, human characters, facing realistic conflicts and generally being completely awesome about it (a couple of scenes had me yelling hell yes in my head). The only thing that makes the characters kind of strange is that they're particularly articulate and pensive, so some scenes have you asking yourself \\"who talks like that?\\". But it's still believable in the context, and it's worth it to suspend disbelief to get a glimpse of her philosophy. Her ideas make sense, but you have to understand what she means when she's saying altruism is bad and selfishness is good, she intends very specific definitions, and when you work it all out it isn't as sensationalistic as it first sounds.    Overall The Fountainhead is to Objectivism what WE is to dystopian literature. It is a novel of ideas, but you only care about it because you have characters to relate to. It makes you think, but only because you are trying to understand the characters' motivations. It isn't just flat out telling you what to believe. Even the most expository sections feel like they belong as meaningful events in the novel. They take place at appropriate moments, speeches, a defense at a trial, after hours of meditation; it doesn't feel like it was just transposed from Rand's journal to the page.    If you care about being entertained first and enlightened second (if at all), this is the right Rand book to pick up.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I loved this movie!  If you know who ABBA are, then you will love this movie.  The ABBA music is sang throughout the movie by various actors.  Also, it has a great story.  I did not know that Meryl Streep also can sing very well.  Piece Brosnan did well also, and it really made him even hotter when he was singing!
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|The movie is fun but not as high quality as I expected. Meryl Streep is brilliant but the actors are less impressive, especially the singing. The sound quality of the DVD is disappointing.
B001152TL6|5.0|Many talk about Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire as Lynch's mind melters, but this was the first film of his (other than Eraserhead) to really push the surreal, nightmare, \\"dream\\" \\"logic\\" that has permeated his films since (except for The Straight Story).<br /><br />I was always a fan of Lynch's, but this film was a genuine surprise when I saw it.  Siskel and Ebert, who I admired very much when I was young but became disillusioned with them in the 90's when they recommended practically everything they saw, dissed this film.  The poster in the newspaper said \\"Two thumbs down!  Siskel and Ebert.  Two more great reasons to see Lost Highway.\\".  Well, that was the keeper.  I saw it, I loved it, and it's Lynch's most underrated film.<br /><br />Everything thing in this film works, from the great, complex script, to the moody, intense cinematography, to the great sound design (and exemplary use of music).  It was made in 1995 during a decade not known for artistic films.  It has great performances (especially by Patricia Arquette and Robert Blake).  It has great scenes, like the one where Bill Pullman \\"calls\\" his own home from Blake's cell phone, and Blake is at Pullman's home.  It still creeps me out.  It's also the last film by Richard Pryor, who was confined to a wheelchair due to his multiple scerosis.  The film never lets up in its intensity.  There are no dull momments in its 135 minute running time.  You will be transfixed.<br /><br />This film doesn't make any literal sense, but if you surrender to the nightmare of it, it's pretty damn awesome.  It's one of Lynch's most memorable, mesmerizing works, a great precursor to his later \\"nightmare\\" masterpieces, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I saw Rush on this tour in Philadelphia, and they were full of energy. I wish I could say the same for the crowd at the show, but the overall experience was great. What I love about the DVD is that it's not clips from various parts of their tour; It's a live show from Holland, in which the band's performance was relatively flawless.    On Disk 1, the show opens with Limelight, and flip flops from older material to some of the newer tracks on Snakes and Arrows. The second disk opens with Far Cry, one of the best tracks they've written in years, and covers most of the Snakes and Arrows album.  The encore consists of some absolute Rush classics, such as Train to Bangkok and YYZ.     I highly recommend this live DVD over some of their other releases. In addition to Snakes and Arrows being one of their best efforts in years, the set list is very diverse, and the band seemed to have a great time during the Snakes and Arrows tour.

1400082773|5.0|In the Introduction, Barack Obama downplays his writing ability and storytelling in this book that is best described as a memoir.  In doing this to his writing, he does a tremendous disservice to himself.  Unlike many memoirs, \\"Dreams from My Father\\" flows as comparably to a well-written novel.  And for those who ask, \\"Who is the real Barack Obama?\\", this book tells the story of the man that would become our president in his own words.    To give a concise explanation, the young Barack Obama was a conflicted man.  Born to a woman born from Kansas and a man born in Kenya, he found himself torn between cultures.  With the white grandparents that raised him, the awkward situations that he tells of often prove humorous yet sad.  But when Obama became a teenager, he began to break away to find himself.  Though he succumbed to less positive influences, he learned from the experiences and chose to use the opportunity to better himself.      The gravity of the story continually pulls it toward the man Barack Obama only met once when he was 10 years old, his father.  The meeting with his father is a melancholy event, certain to tug at the heart strings of readers.  It is also an event that left an impression.  Like his father, he sought something more.  After college, it would lead him to becoming a community organizer.  Living in the Chicago area my whole life, the names and places in these story were often quite familiar.    Though it is an important part of the story, Obama's trip to Kenya is the one part of the book where in begins to lose steam.  Having such a large family, it may be difficult for some to track the relations without the benefit of pictures or a chart.  Yet it is an Kenya where Barack Obama finds resolution to the relationship with his father.      Though the story ends in 1992 long before Barack Obama would enter the national spotlight, readers are able to see the events that would foster the development of the 44th President.  In terms of race relations, African culture, and American culture, it is among the most enlightening books that I have read.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|For Emma, Forever ago was one of my favourite albums of 2007.  Recorded in a cabin in the dead of winter in Wisconsin, the effects really show in the album. Old recording equipment and self recording/production results in a lo-fi sound which doesn't hinder Justin Vernon's creativity, or the complexity of the record. The isolation and introspection result in well thought out lyrics, and a common theme throughout.  Double-tracked vocals and layers only make his voice that more chilling.  Plain spoken words in swells and troughs make this album a superb listen. The nostalgia and intimacy of vinyl only adds to the experience of listening to this album seamlessly (besides the A to B switch). In a word, wondrous.

0316017922|5.0|The thing that I love most about the writing of Malcolm Gladwell is that he enables me to see familiar things in new ways. For that reason, he is one of three writers of \\"business books\\" whose works I frequently re-read. The two other writers are Jim Collins (\\"Good to Great\\") and Seth Godin (\\"Tribes,\\" \\"Purple Cow,\\" etc.) As a result of reading \\"The Tipping Point,\\" I no longer look at familiar objects in the same way - graffiti, subway turnstiles, broken windows. In the same vein, after reading \\"Blink,\\" when I attend an orchestra concert, I wonder about the process of auditioning prospective musicians behind a curtain to prohibit the jury from being swayed by gender prejudice.<br /><br />Gladwell's latest offering, \\"Outliers,\\" raises the curtain and reveals hidden patterns in such diverse realms as math learning, blood feuds in Appalachia and plane crashes. It is a fascinating study into the hidden factors - often cultural and anthropological in nature - that explain extraordinary levels of success. In the most simple form, Gladwell's premise - beautifully told in gripping vignettes and mini-biographies - is that hard work is necessary for success - but more is required. He makes a compelling case by finding the same pattern of cultural antecedents occurring in widely disparate enterprises and parts of the world.<br /><br />Early in the book, Gladwell talks about the rare longevity and health of the inhabitants of tiny Roseto, Pennsylvania.<br /><br />\\"Wolf and Bruhn had to convince the medical establishment to think about health and heart attacks in an entirely new way: they had to get them to realize that they wouldn't be able to understand why someone was healthy if all they did was think about an individual's personal choices or actions in isolation. They had to look beyond the individual. They had to understand the culture he or she was part of, and who their friends and family were, and what town their families came from. They had to appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.<br /><br />In Outliers, I want to do for our understanding of success what Stewart Wolf did for our understanding of health.\\" (Pages 10-11)<br /><br />And Gladwell succeeds spectacularly in his mission to illuminate the topic of success. Later in the book, as he addresses the patterns of connectivity that have led to the spectacular success of some Jewish lawyers in New York City, he identifies the recipe that makes work satisfying for an individual:<br /><br />\\"Those three things - autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward - are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying. It is not how much money we make that ultimately makes us happy between nine and five. It's whether our work fulfills us. . . Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning\\" (Pages 149-150)<br /><br />This book has great practical value. The cultural component of the communication patterns learned from studying the cockpit recording from plane crashes impacts the way in which one should communicate cross-culturally in a business setting. I am rushing to write this review this morning so that I can race to the airport to hand my copy of the book off to a friend as he prepares to head to Nicaragua for a business trip. I want him to have the advantage of Gladwell's insights before opening his mouth in his first meeting in Managua tomorrow morning.<br /><br />I am rushing to Logan Airport; I encourage you to rush to a bookstore or an on-line book source and pick up Gladwell's landmark work Outliers.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Alrld we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.

0671015206|5.0|Ask anyone about the lifestyle of millionaires not just in America but in any country in the world, he / she will most likely tell you about yachts, luxury travels, expensive cars, dream homes, heavy consumption, expensive jewelry etc. Very few people are likely to talk about frugality and a modest lifestyle as the characteristic lifestyle of millionaires. After all who spends all the money on luxuries if not millionaires ? Do you think the answer is millionaires ? Wrong : it is high income generating and / or high debt hyperconsumers. But aren't high income generators also millionaires ? Answer : not most of the time. In this book the authors Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko explain with examples that most millionaires are self made ; they are not necessarily inheritors of wealth. In fact inheritors of wealth are usually hyperconsumers who spend it all away and do not end up becoming millionaires like their parents. The number one characteristic of the millionaire lifestyle is frugality ; living below their means and investing the surplus wisely. Many people do not know the difference between income and wealth. High income is good in building wealth if it is not all spent away but some of it is invested. The problem is that this requires delayed gratification which requires self discipline that most high income people don't have. So following years of upper middle class standard of life characterized by hyperspending they end up retiring with no wealth.    The wealthy on the other hand delay luxurious consumption and invest a certain percentage of their incomes into income generating assets. When their accumulated wealth reaches a certain level they purchase luxuries without endangering their wealth. So most of the people you see on yachts, wearing expensive watches and jewelry are high income generators who will most probably end up with no wealth in their older years. The people in the process of becoming millionaires which could take 30 years or even morelive in modest neighborhoods, drive ordinary sometimes even second hand cars, dress and in short live modestly in everyway. Some of them may have high incomes but a vast majority of them have learned to get by on a modest income and generate wealth from that average income by saving and investing  about 10 % of their income every month for about 30 years or so. It doesn't matter where they invest ; stocks, Treasury Bills etc. Compounding small income streams over 30 years buids enormous wealths.    One very striking thing that the authors mention is how adults receiving financial support from their affluent parents develop weak characters in terms of wealth  building ability. They are in fact adult children, because they haven't developed the self discipline to be frugal and build wealth. Their well meaning parents unknowingly make them weaker by supporting them financially. Their children are often adults in their 30's, 40's and sometimes even 50's and surprisingly many of them have careers ; some are professors, doctors, lawyers etc. Their common trait is that they enjoy an upper middle class lifestyle through hyperconsumption financed in part by their own incomes but to a great extent by financial support provided by their wealthy parents who may be in their 80's by now. They think their parents' wealth is their income. In reality their parents are wealthy but they are not. What is even worse is that their children also get accustomed to the upper middle class living standard. But once the  financial support and / or inheritance from the grandparents is all consumed away the grand children risk falling into a poor lifestyle. Because nobody other than the grandparents knew how to build wealth. In fact, many of these adult children are aware that they can not generate wealth and therefore worry and are very anxious about their future. In summary, when the affluent provide for \\" financial outpatient care\\" by financially supporting their adult children they prevent the development of the character qualities such as frugality in them. So their children and or their grandchildren are often doomed to a poor lifestyle following an irresponsible hyperconsumptive life funded by parental financial help. Although the authors have written these for the USA I would like to add that this is the situation in many countries including the USA. I just didn't know that it was as prevalent as the authors explain.    We can learn a lot from this book / CD  but the sad thing is that it is probably difficult to change our lifestyles and habits if it turns out that our present consumption / saving habits are not making us millionaires ; if for example your family's lifestyle is hyperconsumptive and there is no frugality, you may have a hard time after reading this book in changing the habits of all the family members so that everybody will become frugal and thereby increase the chances of you and your family becoming millionaries.

0316017922|1.0|I was very excited when the book came out, now that I've read Outliers, I see that Gladwell should start writing fiction.  Two chapters are interesting, the first two.  Then...add the rest of the book to your fireplace to keep the fire going while you get another book to read.  The last chapter should have taken place on the couch of Gladwell's therapist.  So you and your mother are Mulatoo's, big deal.  You'd think that since you are an accomplished author you'd get over it, apparently not.  Spend some time with your therapist until you have a better topic.
0802798225|4.0|Brittany Ellis and Alejandro Fuentes go to Fairfield High on the outskirts of Chicago. And that is the one and only thing they have in common. She is the captain of the pom squad. He is a member of a local gang. On the whole, they could be categorized as Less Than Thrilled to be made lab partners in chemistry for the entirety of their senior year. What follows is a fair bit of verbal sparring, a healthy dose of teenage angst, and a whole helluva lot of sexual tension. Forced to spend time together outside of school working on their final project, Alex and Brittany discover more about each other than they ever wanted to know. Soon they are forced to decide just what they will do with their newfound knowledge. I, for one, couldn't wait to find out. Okay, so I knew from the moment they met exactly what they would do with it. But, honestly, I was enjoying myself way too much to care.<br /><br />So, yeah. This thing is the real deal. It's star crossed lovers against the world. It's passionate pleas and rising music. It's [[ASIN:B00008972S West Side Story (Special Edition DVD Collector's Set)]] sans the whole love at first sight bit. In fact, these two kids despise each other. They're both smart, sexy, and very very troubled. And they have several sizeable barriers to cross before they can even begin to take each other seriously. Is it sappy and predictable and overwrought? Yes. Did I love it? Oh, yeah. Why? Because, quite simply, Simone Elkeles made me believe in these two. I wanted so much for them. And, even though I knew it would, I could not stop reading until I was sure things came out all right for them in the end. Suddenly I was fourteen years old again and falling in love with [[ASIN:0743477111 Romeo and Juliet (Folger Shakespeare Library)]] for the first time. There's nothing like that feeling and it was nice to have it back for just a little while.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What else can be said about this classic Christmas movie?  \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a Wonderful movie!
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Alright. I saw this movie one ana half times. A half a time in the theater, and once at home.<br /><br /> The reason why I saw a half a time was because when I went to see it in theater, I made the mistake of getting popcorn. I didn't make it through the first half hour of the movie before I had to run to the RR and THROW UP.<br /><br /> The camera movement on this movie was HORRIBLE. And I'm not one to get sick easy- the Blair Witch project didn't give me any trouble. I didn't expect this one too, either, but it did.<br /><br /> But the whole Godzilla twist deal, coupled with the previews of the havoc being laid apon New York, well. I was intruiged enough to give it another shot. I rented it and took it home.<br /><br />Man, what a disappointer. This is my first negative movie rating, and it's well earned. Not only was the camera shaking still a major bother, but still managed to make me sick, even while I was watching it on my portable! On top of that, the ending of this movie was just atrocious. No resolution to the plot at all, it just leaves you hanging. Like the sopranos and the frakin' cut to black crap.  Hasn't anyone told these film makers the only people whose allowed to get away with that is M. Night and Stephen King? Theres a reason why people hate these endings. Your doin' it RONG!<br /><br />-spoiler warning-<br /><br /> The only upside to this movie was the awesome scene where the monster comes up and whacks the helicopter out of the sky. I was praying for the monsters victory if only so the characters would DIE and end my stomach nausea.<br /><br />To bad, they lived, and this horrible movie kept going for another 15 minutes.<br /><br />Please don't let these dudes make any more movies...
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|hard candy is another commercial failure from madonna, and it's because the entire project reeks of desperation. her longevity in the pop industry has been impressive...it's hard to believe this is the same women that gave us like a prayer, or evita. but madonna is turning 50. and she has been partially written off. So she decides to embrace something completely commercial and bland. So determined to cling to the charts that she works with Timbaland. seriously, anything more obvious? this is a damnation only ashlee simpson should be reduced too. kudos for timbaland and madonna for actually coming up with a decent material, but this nothing but a precisely aimed and vapid album. The image Madonna projects is of a women who is so insecure and unable to accept that her creative peek is over, and even after admitting what a joke it all is in american life and other albums, has given up and been swallowed back in. how audacious. It's nothing but very suggestable songs created by other people. The Neptunes and Timbaland, who are both known for all the hip flavor of the moment jams, create all of those innovative but similar sounding beats that end up hitting the top ten for whoever ends up getting to sing them. the lyrics seem to sometimes reference lyrics from older madonna albums....Maybe Madonna sees the bleakness of it and is simply doing it for sport. For this reason, this album is nothing more than her most blatantly superficial. and her most desperate. not enjoyable. awkward listen. Madonna is being ironic, but that's one of the few reasons this is even excusable. five stars for image, 1 star for originality. She just sold out, and the point she is making this time is she knows how obvious it is.

B0014VPFTA|4.0|Although most of the CD isn't exactly my taste, \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" is a beautiful anthem - it sounds like 2/3 Van Morrison and 1/3 Curtis Mayfield. BTW, if you aren't not old enough to remember Curtis Mayfield, give him a listen and I'm sure you'll like it. The strongest influence I hear in most of the other tracks is Al Green, as many sound like his slower ballads.
0321525655|3.0|Know at the ouset the author says that he doesn't want to give out a formula for making a presentation. Instead he gives an overview of how to effectively communicate your ideas with broad strokes. When I bought the book I was interested in the background of communication but I wanted more how to and examples of how to communicate my ideas better. Too much attention paid to background information too little instruction. Maybe the publisher should consider slimming down the background, shrink the pages ,and charge less.

0141439475|3.0|just about everyone has heard the story of Frankenstein, so i'm going to skip that part of the review and go right on to \\"what is this story about\\".<br /><br />well, as far as i can tell it appears to be about a woman, who leaves the security-and watchful eyes- of friends and family, gets pregnant, has a child, then spends the rest of the book covering up while the child finds out just what it is like to be a bastard in the early 1800's. with no friends, family, connections, or money the child has no hope of a future and decides to take revenge on its creator.<br /><br />why do i think Frankenstein is a woman? having read quite a few gothic novels, i can say that victor is not a masculine character, he is a feminine one. he does not do guy things like shooting, hunting, hanging out with the guys riding horses. he spends his time at home with the ladies doing girl things.<br /><br />his decent into moral wrong is simple, he reads trashy novels that gives him ideas, when he is away from friends and family he has the opportunity to experiment with these dark ideas, with no one to check him he sinks deeper and deeper in to depravity until finally he creates a fully fledged monster and the sight of which suddenly causes him to realize all the terrible things that he has done, and no one must know about.<br /><br />now take this and turn it into a female's way. SHE reads trashy novels, SHE is away from friends and family and has the opportunity to experiment with these ideas, with no one to check her SHE sinks deeper and deeper into depravity until she gives birth at which time she realizes all the terrible things that she has done, and no one must know about.<br /><br /> the most telling feminine thing victor does is just after he creates the monster. he faints and is sick for 3 months. a woman being sick for 3 month used to be indicative of bed fever. a person cant get bed fever without having a baby first.

0670020478|5.0|While Ken Robinson intends this book for the general public, from my perspective as an educator, it is a must read for teachers and administrators in public and private education. I would also suggest that they look at his earlier works as well. He is a passionate supporter of the kind of education we are quickly losing to high-stakes testing and a narrow view of what the curriculum should be. While focusing on the individual, he offers many lessons much needed in our schools. I have watched Sir Ken hold an audience of over 500 people in the palm of his hand for over an hour. This book reflects some of the passion and good humor of that experience. I suggest also you go to the internet and listen to his presentation to TED and others that are available there.    I would like to add to this review a response to that of Paula Macintyre. There is no indication in her review that she has read the Element. And the sly insinuation that Sir Ken has merely \\"repackaged\\" the ideas of Julia Cameron is nonsense! Sir Ken has fought long and hard over thirty years to bring the arts into their proper place as a central part of the school curriculum. I suggest that anyone interested start with his 1980s report on the arts in the schools (available on amazon) and move forward from there. I am an admirer of Julia Cameron's work; I doubt that she would appreciate support that denigrates the work of another, especially someone who has dedicated his life to this work.
B000J103WK|5.0|We bought this after a friend got one and we were just had to have a copy (we also bought the \\"Best of the Eagle\\" CD). We found the quality of picture (HD/DVD) and sound outstanding! We have had it for around two weeks and have played it at least 12 times. Just listening to the music is worth it. I highly recomend this to anyone who simply likes the number one hits by this classic band.
B000ZN802W|5.0|After reading the book, I felt compelled to watch the movie, and I was very impressed. The casting was superb, and it followed the book very accurately, rare to see in cases like this. Emile Hirsch also looks just like McCandless, adding to the realism. The way the movie was set up was captivating and spellbinding, and the camera work was wonderful. One of the things I was impressed with and glad at was that it was kept an adult-style film from an adult-style book. They didn't try to dumb down anything, to lower the rating, and kept language, violence, etc. true to the book. If they had removed certain scenes or lines (there is some nudity and language - didn't bother me at all; it fit right in), it would have made the film seem more childish and not the serious thing it was intended to be. Overall, a brilliant adaptation of the book, and worth watching.

B000063COX|4.0|Iron Maiden ****<br /><br />I never really was much of a fan of the post Paul Di'Anno era Iron Maiden, mainly because as good as Bruce Dickinson's voice is (which it is admittedly good) it to me gets old very quick and ofter times adds a layer of cheese to a style of music where any amount of cheese kills it. Let me explain; metal is like three cheese lasagna, it already has a lot of cheese because it tries to be the toughest thing ever which doesn't always work, than you have the outfits, plus the subject matter of most of the music, than you have the meet which is the attitude. Well if you add another layer of cheese (i.e. power vocals) it ofter kills it for me as it does with every Maiden album after killers. I much prefer Di'Anno's rougher and tougher vocals because while still better than most peoples vocals it doesn't go without street cred. Also this era of Maiden sounds more punk than metal to me which is a desired sound in my camp.<br /><br />The first two Iron Maiden albums for me are golden, especially this, the bands self-titled debut album from 1980. Dave Murray still plays some of the greatest guitar playing of his life here. Though he only has Dennis Stratton at this stage it is more of a lead versus rhythm sound to the band giving the music a more organic feel which I think sounds ages better over their dueling lead work on the latter albums. That is great every once in a while but soon enough just feels like harmonic noodling. Dave Murray really shines here. And as a whole the band sounds tight as ever.<br /><br />Tracks like the classic opener 'Prowler' and 'Sanctuary' show you what we are in for with this punk band with metal tendencies. 'Remember Tomorrow' is truly what I think Richie Blackmoore was trying to accomplish with Deep Purples 'Chile In Time' of their Deep Purple In Rock album some ten years before this. It is the sort of neo-classic mini epic that Blackmoore would trade his fairy boots in for to be able to compose. 'Phantom' is obviously a self explained classic as is the title track and 'Charlotte The Harlot' which truly is the only song that even sounds or feels like anything the band would do after they gave Di'Anno the axe (big mistake in my opinion because while they gained in popularity they began to sound horrible after the lose of him).<br /><br />Iron Maiden is a hard rock and metal classic from one of the biggest names in the game, but just like Peter Greens Fleetwood Mac isn't your mother and fathers Fleetwood, its much better, this isn't your daddies Iron Maiden it's much much better.ssic as is the title track and 'Charlotte The Harlot' which truly is the only song that even sounds or feels like anything the band would do after they gave Di'Anno the axe (big mistake in my opinion because while they gained in popularity they began to sound horrible after the lose of him).    Iron Maiden is a hard rock and metal classic from one of the biggest names in the game, but just like Peter Greens Fleetwood Mac isn't your mother and fathers Fleetwood, its much better, this isn't your daddies Iron Maiden it's much much better.
006135323X|4.0|While I'd like to think I make my decisions as a rational and informed individual, I know I do not. I pay too much for designer sneakers, procrastinate on long term goals, and find it extremely hard to let go of options. It is with the help of this book that I gain more insights into my own decision making process. I can certainly use all the help I can get to overcome making irrational decisions. I would recommend this book for an interesting read.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|The Doors-Strange Days *****<br /><br />Strange Days by the Doors even more than their purple hued classic debut album is one of the most brilliant collections of music this side of John Coltrane's A Love Supreme. As I sit and really think of writing this review in the most of subjective ways I simply cannot. To me Strange Days is one of my ten favorite albums of all time, the greatest psychedelic album ever, and maybe the greatest album of 1967 a year that brought us such classics as & Nico, Are You Experienced? and so many more making this to me the greatest album of the 1960's. That is how deep my love for the flawless Strange Days goes.<br /><br />Many try to knock 'Horse Latitudes' but shame on those who do so. This is Morrison at his most pretentious and thus his most honest and entertaining. Mindless poetic banter...yes. Pointless...hardly. The albums title track is pure psychotic bliss. A track so twisted that it makes me yearn for Scott Weiland to cover it on his next solo album. 'You're Lost Little Girl' 'Unhappy Girl' and 'I Can't See You In My Mind' are scary and three of the purest love songs Morrison ever wrote about his common law wife Pamela, but what really makes these track kick is the key work by Manzarek, it rivals that of even 'Light My Fire' off the debut. The two hit singles 'Love Me Two Times' a rollicking blues number via Kriegers killer guitar riff and Morrison's soldier gone to war lyrics is both sexy and fun. But as sexy as Morrison can be he can be twice as scary and 'People Are Strange' is prime proof of such. I've always loved Kriegers short solo on this one, among his best in my opinion. While on the subject of his guitar, 'Moonlight Drive' contains some of the coolest slide work he ever recorded. Morrison's vocals on 'Moonlight' are among his best. Now for me 'My Eyes Have Seen You' is easily my favorite track on the whole record for no other reason that Jim Morrison. His lyrics alone make the album worth buying. Nothing incredibly prolific or life affirming, just pure Morrison and his vocals are simply stellar.<br /><br />'When The Musics Over' is so brilliant is deserves it's very own paragraph.

B0019EXZY4|4.0|In the midst of a whole heck of a lot of action thrillers in which the emphasis is squarely on how much demolition can be done--and by the way, here's a special feature to show how--The Bank Job, while in fact including that, focuses on the human element much more than these other movies and comes out a winner for it.<br /><br />The premise is novel and Jason Statham reveals aspects of a character he hasn't really portrayed before--someone with smarts enough to talk his way through some gritty situations, as well as someone who cheats on his wife with a former colleague and manages to get away with it. He's the soul of the movie, but it's a lot of fun to see David Souchet play a bad guy, very different from the terrorist bad guy in Executive Decision. In The Bank Job, Suchet sports a wig that can only be called a \\"rug\\" and interestingly enough, one of the special features is the director Roger Donaldson discussing all the work that went into defining the look of the movie, whose setting is 1970's London--including Souchet's hairpiece!<br /><br />This is a reallly entertaining movie based, in fact, on a true story about robbers getting away with 4 million pounds, just to make sure upper level government officials secure some pretty scandalous photos which were stashed away in one of the bank's safety deposit boxes--i.e., robbers keep the cash as long as they turn over the photos.<br /><br />Not as simple as might be thought; all kinds of complications arise, and that's where the fun is.<br /><br />Highly entertaining; definitely recommended.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|The Doors ****1/2<br /><br />One of the greatest things about the Doors' catalogue is that no single album in the bunch sounds anything remotely like any other in the collection. The bands self-titled debut being the most straight ahead shoot at a pure rock n' roll album. Thought even then it is a stretch to consider this a rock n' roll album; psychedelic is more likely. Irregardless The Doors is one of the greatest debut and rock albums of all time.<br /><br />The purple hued music  that fills the eleven tracks on The Doors are some of the strongest that the group would ever make, many of which would go on to be hit singles and covered by many. Criminally underrated guitarist and songwriter Robbie Krieger's 'Light My Fire' went on to become the bands biggest hit single and signature song, both being sold to Chevy for a commercial and to many other artists who would also gain number one singles with it. 'Break On Through (To The Other Side)' while never becoming a hit has become a classic and a radio staple. 'The End' the most taboo song in rock history closes the album in true epic form but not before many other great tracks. 'End Of The Night' might be the greatest and most impressive thing that Morrison ever recorded. The darkly haunting slide work from Krieger along side Manzarek's keys create a feeling of desperation. Not but to help this feeling is Morrison's autobiographical lyrics about his love for the dark side of life, including death. 'Back Door Man' is the blues cover Jimmy Page wishes he pulled off and 'Twentieth Century Fox' is just a killer rocker. Both 'Soul Kitchen' and 'The Crystal Ship' were covered by seminal L.A. punk band X and guitar God Joe Perry on his solo album. While both were good they failed in comparison to the originals.<br /><br />The only minor flaw to the album is the often horrendous 'Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)' which while fun for the occasional spin is very novelty and unworthy of a Doors record, though it would have made a bitchin' B-side.<br /><br />The Doors is one of the rare moments in rock n' roll where everything just seems to click and fall into place. While the Doors would go on to record better albums, none would surpass this in importance, influence or in stature.s is one of the rare moments in rock n' roll where everything just seems to click and fall into place.

B000EGDC14|2.0|You know I love Goldfrapp and that's why I was highly disappointed with this album.  When I was first introduced to this group I thought how amazing they were.  First there was \\"Felt Mountain\\" which I consider in my top five, a thoroughly amazing album!  Ambient, Dark, weird with a touch of winter trip-hop.  Then came \\"Black Cherry\\" a 180 degree turn from \\"Felt Mountain\\".  It was everything that \\"Felt Mountain\\" was not - lustful, glam,  with a touch of 80's Electo-rock.  A fantastic album in it self, though not as brilliant as \\"Felt Mountain\\".      \\"Supernature\\" - Goldfrapp's Pop Hour.  This album I like to think of as \\"Black Cherry\\" part 2 or a lesser version of that album.  Moving towards dance remix land and pop.  This album sits on the edge of alternative and mainstream.  Much too polished and not interesting enough to keep you sticking around.     Sadly this is a throw-away album from a fantastic band.
B000MCIBB6|4.0|The Doors-Waiting For The Sun ****<br /><br />Waiting For The Sun, Morrison's love album is often concidered the Doors worst album by many, when I must say I listen to Waiting For The Sun more than any other Doors album. Not sure why but it is just a fantastic organic record. Not quite the over the top fiasco that The Soft Parade is though it does feel very bipolar. Some of the strangest sounding songs in the bands career can be found here along side some of their most normal linear tracks.<br /><br />'Hello, I Love You' and 'Not To Touch The Sun' along side tracks like 'Summers Almost Over' sounds a bit uneven and is really the only reason why I will not give Waiting For The Sun a higher rating than a four star. Because really on a personal level many of my favorite Doors songs can be found right here. The Psychedelic portrait of American society in 1968 'The Unknown Soldier' was one of the most graphic songs of it's kind and time, but than again this is coming from the man who wrote 'The End' easily the most taboo track in rock history so this does lay pretty tame in comparison.<br /><br />'Yes, The River Knows' is a whisky soaked ballad sung in the most honest voice Morrison ever knew, while 'Love Street' is fun yet still full of longing. 'We Could Be So Good Together' is a plea for Morrison to find the love he at the time felt he lost in his then common law wife Pamela after he found her with another man. On 'Five To One' we find once again Morrison professing his love for her as the rest of his band and management try to tare them apart claiming she wasn't good for him.<br /><br />While this really is Morrison's love album, Krieger and Manzarek both equally make large contributions. Kriegers guitar work on the flamenco flavoured 'Spanish Caravan' is out of this world and one of his greatest achievements as is the albums closer 'Five To One' which contains his greatest ever solo. Manzarek for the first time ditches the odd key and synth sounds in search of a more organic and natural piano sound, and surprisingly it works here.<br /><br />Waiting For The Sun is far from the the greatest release the Doors made but for a serious fan it is a must have.und, and surprisingly it works here.     Waiting For The Sun is far from the the greatest release the Doors made but for a serious fan it is a must have.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I rented this awhile ago and finally bought my own DVD (I don't purchase many movies) so I could enjoy it again.  I had to get the TV room just right, the lights down low, extra speakers hooked up (not too loud to wake up my sleeping daughter upstairs), a nice cup of hot tea.  What a wonderful movie, gorgeous sets, music, actors, and voices.    Gerard Butler said this in an interview     \\"so I wanted to become as technically good as I could. Honestly, I wanted to hear his life story in every note, which therefore I think weakens him up in the beginning because I always felt even through \\"Music of the Night\\" that even in his more seductive moments it was tinged with pain. Like he always knew this wasn't going to be for him. It was a controlled yet desperate attempt at something he knew he wasn't going to have any luck in. Maybe it was too much, but it was my instinctive feeling when I first read it ...    You did an excellent job, Mr. Butler.  The Phantom will haunt my dreams.  :-)     I can't stop thinking about it today and had to do some reading up on the making of the movie.
B000002I2G|4.0|The Doors-The Soft Parade ****1/2<br /><br />The Doors did very little wrong in my eyes. Waiting for the Sun is concidered one of their weakest albums, while it is one of my most loved and cherished of the groups albums. The Soft Parade is widely agreed to be the bands weakest album, I love it as well. No it isn't as revolutionary as the debut, or as darkly beautiful as Strange Days, or even as solid as L.A. Woman but The Soft Parade is The Doors. Well what people define The Doors as anyways. They are always labeled a psychedelic bluesy rock band. Okay well that is what you have here. Isn't the point of being a psychedelic band to be as far out and adventurous as possible? That is what the Doors are all about and The Soft Parade embodies that more than any other album in the bands canon. While not as varied in sound as Waiting for the Sun or a pigeon holed in one sound as Morrison Hotel, The Soft Parade finds solid ground taking a little bit of each Doors album and creating one crazy trip.<br /><br />While most of the album is dominated by Robbie Krieger songs that does not mean it is bad, that only explains why it is unlike any other Doors album. 'Tell All The People' is classic shamanistic Morrison as read through Kriegers lyrics. 'Touch Me' became a large hit and radio classic while it is the second weakest track on the album. 'Shamans Blues' finds a broken spirited Morrison rapping over a wailing organ from Manzarek. 'Do It' is a classic Indian chant by way of Krieger's guitar and Morrison's poetic prose in the same vein as 'My Wild Love.' 'Easy Ride' is slow and sexy while 'Wild Child' is angry and passive in the same breath. 'Runnin' Blue' plays like a hippie freak out near Haight & Ashbury in San Francisco. 'Wishful Sinful' is really the only weak track and it isn't even that bad.' Keeping true to the epic closing tradition, 'The Soft Parade' serves as one hell of a title track. One part blues vamp, one part lament, another part religious experince/revalation, and all part amazing. I've heard people say this album and this track in perticular are self-indulgent. Well...duh, that is the point. That is why everyone loves Jim Morrison. I know for me personally I wouldn't hold rock musicians to half the standards I do if it weren't for Jim Morrison being the self-indulgent, idiotic genius that he is.<br /><br />The Soft Parade is not a bad album by any means.

0142000655|5.0|As the title implies, East of Eden is a tale loosely based on the Bible's Book of Genesis, the story of the first human beings. The Salinas Valley of the early 20th century becomes the setting for the Garden of Eden. The descriptive imagery remains to be one of the most alluring features that holds underlying meanings as well. John Steinbeck artistically weaves universal themes of contrasting forces, especially in his portrayals of the surrounding environment. In East of Eden, one becomes conscious of the interconnections between the universe and between three generations of people.  Despite the dullness of the first few chapters, the ending is one that slams into the reader and leaves a sense of satisfaction at the way things played out. The plot moves faster and faster and builds quicker and quicker until the climax. Similarly, the early characters are not yet as complex as the later ones, ones that readers become more attached to.  The same characters of Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel are reincarnated in his characters of Adam, Cathy, Charles, Cal, and Aron. Their connection to the Bible makes the tale both predictable and whimsical. Although their actions reflect actions those of their Biblical counterparts in some way or sort, there is often a twist that renders the action theirs and theirs only. Each of the Trasks and Hamiltons are complex individual characters that readily exercise their own power of choice. Coincidentally, timshel, the power of choice, is one of Steinbeck's major themes, among themes of good versus evil and light versus dark. While Cal realizes his power and aims to change himself for good, other characters are less aware of their own part. One of the most enticing aspects of the story is his fight to free himself from the restraints that the Bible puts on him. Sure, he resembles Cain, but that does not mean that he is destined to be evil. It is this understanding that makes him the most interesting and perhaps the most dynamic player in the drama. Cathy, on the other hand, is simply bad and does nothing to prove otherwise. All she knows is evil, so that evil is her form of good. There is, however, a mystery to her that makes her passages of the book passages worth reading into and interpreting if only to discover her motives. Because even though we all know her evil, she elicits different levels of evil that both lures and disgusts others to dive deeper into her character.  Written from different perspectives, East of Eden gives a patchwork account that can be interpreted as both helpful and tiring to read. It gives power to the reader as readers experience the omniscient viewpoint of knowing all while the characters themselves are still oblivious. But even when the story is so accessible to readers, there are still questions that the story proposes but never answers.
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|I have never seen the stage show of \\"Mamma Mia\\" so I can't compare the movie to it, but friends raved about it.  Comparing their opinion of the stage show to the movie, I believe this movie could have been much better than it was.<br /><br />My overall comment is that the casting choices were interesting -- and not in a good way -- for a musical.  Perhaps the best feature of the DVD is the option to put it on sing-along mode so you can belt out the great ABBA tunes and not have to hear some of the less-than-fabulous cast singing.<br /><br />First, Pierce Brosnan should never sing anywhere but his shower; and then only if no one is around to hear him.  I used to believe that studio \\"tweaking\\" could make anyone sound halfway decent.  If that's the best they could do with his voice, he must have been just awful.  Didn't anyone ask him to sing before casting him?  There are many actors old enough to be the father of a 20-year-old; they could have found one who could sing.<br /><br />Colin Firth is probably too young for his role; he's a decade younger than Ms. Streep and the other guys.  He and Stellan Skårsgard sang better than Pierce Brosnan, but neither one is really a singer.  Meryl Streep does OK with the vocals but that role has the most singing so it would have been better to cast a singing actress, like Patti LuPone.  The best cast role is the daughter; Amanda Seyfried did a good job.<br /><br />I loved the setting and the staging of the group musical numbers was good.  And of course the ABBA songs that are the whole point of the musical.  I think if the producers had gone with a cast of singers rather than big name stars, the movie would have been much better.  I'll also note that parents should think about the movie's message before deciding whether to let their children watch it.  In the wedding scene, the daughter tells her mother it's OK she slept around so much she doesn't know who her father is and decides she doesn't want to get married either but just see the world with her fianc&eacute;.  What's wrong with seeing the world as a married couple?What's wrong with seeing the world as a married couple?

Spectacular vehicular carnage, pacey story line that doesn't try to hard to ruin the ride, but enough for you to invest in the characters, and did i mention the stunts, which most are done for real, minimal CGI, only to enhance and clearly include where human life would suffer. Excellent PQ and reference AQ. Must Buy for action fans.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|Addiction is a devastating ailment that destroys lives, relationships, and families.  And it's not pretty to look at; for a compelling, yet emotionally draining, look at alcoholism you can really wrap your arms around, check out [[ASIN:6305692572 When A Man Loves A Woman]].<br /><br />Which is why I'm still torn over 28 DAYS.  This film addresses addiction, yet often in a comedic, lighthearted way.  And I like that. . .to some degree.  Yet I often wonder if this approach somehow sterilizes the ominous undertones and consequences of addiction--and the difficulties of recovery. But enough of my own personal dilemma. . .<br /><br />Sandra Bullock plays (and plays well) a boozing, pill-popping party girl who goes on a binge that lands her in rehab; her journey--from being a rebel in denial to a fragile young woman coping with her fragility--is moving and compelling.  Dominic West is exceptional as Bullock's equally out-of-control boyfriend; Elizabeth Perkins also holds up her own as Bullock's older, often judgmental sister.  Of the fellow recovering addicts, Viggo Mortensen's character was never fully vetted, while Alan Tudyk as a rather flamboyant (and that's putting it mildly) light-in-the-loafers German is hysterical.  Overall a great cast that tackles a dark subject in both dark and light tones; here's hoping the lightheartedness of 28 DAYS doesn't sugarcoat a very serious matter.<br />--D.

B001M5UDGS|4.0|When I bought Dr. Horrible, I had already seen it online and had loved it. It was wonderful to be able to watch it from the comfort of my couch and the 'making of' was really interesting! Having the DVD is really handy when I want to show my not so computer-savvy friends what Dr. Horrible is all about. It's a must buy for fans of the Sing Along Blog.    With all the hype about \\"Commentary: The Musical\\", I think I got my expectations up a little too much. It was okay and some of the songs are catchy- but it's not really a 'commentary' but more like an excuse to sing more. I'll let you form your own opinions about that, though.    I haven't yet been able to access the hidden Easter eggs, because getting to those requires a very complicated combination of button pushing. I might have to give up in that line of pursuit and find it somewhere on the net, so if you're buying the DVD to see those- it's not a good idea.     Also, if you expect it by a certain date, be prepared to wait several days after the supposed time it's to have been delivered. The estimated delivery date that Amazon gives you will make you too hopeful and you might become disappointed quickly.    All in all, Dr. Horrible is a wonderful, wonderful thing to buy. Great for every occasion, I absolutely love it! I had to give it only four stars however, because I'm so steamed that the Easter eggs were made so difficult to get to.

Anybody thinking that the authors have done any research with lots of wealthy people to find out how they teach their kids about money will be disappointed.  Most of the financial advice give here is general, off the cuff and toxic; basically real estate and stock speculation.  The authors also encourage financing this through debt.  The only other bit of advice is to incorporate to avoid taxes.  Anybody who follows this advice is just gambling.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|I think that anyone who has ever seen a Clint Eastwood film would agree that he is a terrific actor.  Whether as a lone cowboy (The Man With No Name Trilogy), a gritty cop (Dirty Harry), or a boxing manager (Million Dollar Baby), Eastwood is able to provide just the right emotions and actions for the part.<br /><br />However, just as important as his acting is the way he progresses his characters in each film he makes.  Unlike, say, Sylvester Stallone, who tries to play Rocky Balboa and John Rambo at 60 years old, Eastwood takes on roles suitable for a man his age (78).  That is the reason why Gran Torino is such a great film.<br /><br />As the movie begins, Eastwood's character--Walt--is a man who no longer fits into today's world.  Being a veteran of the Korean War and a longtime employee at a Ford Motor plant, Walt is a throwback to a different generation.  Thus, when a Hmong family moves in next door to him and a gang of young Mexicans begin terrorizing the neighborhood, Walt withdraws even further into the shell of his past (as we all fear what we do not understand).  The only time we ever see him happy during the film is while swapping old war stories and tell racist jokes with his old pals down at the local bar.  Otherwise, he just bickers with or downright insults everyone else around him, whether it be his Catholic priest, his new neighbors, or even his own family.<br /><br />Due to a completely uncontrollable set of circumstances, however, Walt is drawn into the conflict between the Hmong and Mexican cultures.  At first, he resists all attempts to lend a helping hand or accept a little bit of gratitude, but eventually he begins to form some friendships.  As the film builds towards and finally reaches its climax, Walt finally begins to understand that the conflicts of today's world are really not that much different those played out on the killing fields of Korea.  They may even require the supreme sacrifice in order to make things right.<br /><br />So, while advertised as a story about a Dirty Harry-type character (\\"Get off my lawn\\"), this film is really about so much more.  In typical Eastwood fashion, not only does he deliver a spot-on acting performance filled with his usual grit balanced by some dry humor, but he also advances the \\"aura\\" of his filmography in a way that no other current Hollywood star can match.  Suffice it to say that no chronological context is ever needed for an Eastwood film...he is who he is.<br /><br />Thus, I recommend this film to pretty much everyone (although be warned that the high use of profanity may rule out the tweens).  Relative youngsters (those not yet old enough to get the Senior Citizens discount) will likely enjoy the film because they will be able to better understand the actions/attitudes of their own parent/grandparent.  Seniors will obviously be intrigued as the story is told from \\"their\\" point of view and Walt struggles with the same emotions they themselves may be grappling with.<br /><br />Of course, also in typical Eastwood fashion, so many other themes are hinted at during the film that one could write a review about completely different subject matter and still be spot-on in their analysis.  I can't say for certain that Gran Torino deserved an Oscar nomination in any category (as I haven't seen its competition), but those would have to be some spectacular films to beat this masterpiece.Dirty Harry-type character (\\"Get off my lawn\\"), this film is really about so much more.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I was a little kid when Adam West played Batman on TV.  Hip, campy, hilarious.  As a kid I totally bought it...then could watch them again as a high schooler and cackle at the over-the-top 60s fun.<br /><br />(I met Adam West a few years ago and asked him why the TV series has yet to make it to DVD.  I think it would be a huge seller.  He told me that the music rights are tangling everything up.)<br /><br />Then the darker but still a bit campy 1989 Tim Burton blockbuster came out.  That movie was all Jack Nicholson as the Joker.  Michael Keaton pulled it off but his scenes weren't as well developed and were less interesting than Jack's.  Still, a monster hit.  Tim Burton directed the sequel, which had even LESS action and more weirdness.  I can't even remember the name of that one, just the boredom of seeing it once.<br /><br />Was Val Kilmer next?  BATMAN FOREVER.  Tim Burton moved on and the franchise was handed a slow, horrible death at the hands of Joel Shumacher.  Watching his Batman films was like watching an alternative theatre troupe in San Francisco stage a Caped Crusader cabaret show.  The bad guys were so flamboyant that I wondered if Waylon & Madame from the old Hollywood Squares was going to show up to menace Gotham City.  Street gangs wore glow in the dark pastel face paint.  The bat suit got nipples.  Everyone blamed George Clooney for killing the Batman franchise...no...it was the director.<br /><br />So Warner Brothers let the (sparkling) dust settle and revived the franchise with Christopher Nolan.  Excellent choice.  BATMAN BEGINS wasn't just the reboot the series needed, it was the first GOOD Batman movie ever made.<br /><br />That winning streak continues with THE DARK KNIGHT.  You don't get the feeling you're watching just a comic book movie, you're seeing genuine characters who inhabit a semi-believable world of shifting lines and shadows.  Everything is top of the line.  Yes, it's long.  It almost feels like two films.  But it's great and it blows away all the other films put together.  It's a tragedy that Heath Ledger is gone because his Joker is someone you can't get enough of.  (I don't think I would've even know it was him if he had been unbilled!).<br /><br />Thank you, Christopher Nolan and the rest of the team!

0553208845|5.0|This simple but thought provoking book will have your mind reeling with questions about family, friendship, and the true meaning of life. Hesse invites his readers to join Siddhartha in his journey to self-discovery and challenges readers to look deep into their own lives to find what makes them tick. At the age of thirteen Siddhartha willing leaves his family and his home to go in search for the ultimate nirvana, self-fulliment. He takes with him only his clothes and the three priniciples that will carry him through life; patience, fasting, and meditation. Full of vibrant, youthful idealism, Siddhartha forges into the world struggling to find his place, as well as create a life that is simple and meaningful.<br />  In Siddhartha, Hesse urges readers to look beyond the material world to find what is within mankind that is honorable and can be used to find happiness. Siddhartha, throughout the book relies on his patience to see him through, his fasting to help him survive, and his meditation to center his life. Each time Siddhartha falls into a lifestyle of possession and desire, he quickly releases himself from obligation and returns to his journey. The journey, however physical, is also a journey of the soul- the path back to himself. Each road he takes in the book is a learning experience, and each place leads him to a new light about the mind.<br />  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a desire to learn about their surroundings in a elevated sense, and who enjoys beautiful writing. Fall into an adventure that is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking, and follow Siddhartha's simple but powerful words of wisdom as you compile a new appreciation for the art of patience and meditation.

B001ILHY1I|5.0|I enjoyed this film.  I felt that it had enough action to keep the pace moving well, it's story line was good and I thought it was well explained.  There was also some humor sprinkled in just to give it that extra kick.  The actors/actresses did well in my opinion.  I would recommend it for people that enjoy this kind of movie.
6305907145|3.0|Mansfield Park is one of the more problematic of the Austen creations, mostly because of the heroine, Fanny Brice, who maddens readers with her passivity, goodness and inability to take any initiative. Her method is to be good and wait for good things to happen to her. Of course, ultimately they do when she captures the heart of her drippy cousin Edmund.<br />  This movie inserts a few little touches to \\"bring it up to date,\\" notably a few allusions to the evils of slavery upon which the Mansfield Park finances depend (there is a distant, unseen sugar plantation in Antigua) and also a slight hint of lesbianism which is enough to titillate the senses but no more.<br />If you don't expect too much, we have all the traditional Austen themes in plentiful supply -- the obligatory ball, the walks in the country, a bit of horse riding, a little hint of poverty, a little sexual politics, a rake, a scheming gold digger etc etc.<br />It's fine for an evening in front of the fire. No more, no less.
0684803356|5.0|This is an incredibly good book. Hemingway summoned all his superior story-telling powers and forged an unforgettable wartime epic. Complex, layered and populated by memorable characters, FHTBT is a true masterpiece. It is like an Iliad for the 20th-century man. The tragedy, injustice of war, engulfing good and bad human beings alike in its remorseless swirl, is brought to life with astounding attention to detail and humanistic depth. As you may know, the story takes place during the Spanish Civil War, a brutal conflict that not only tore apart the fabric of Spain's society, but also involved armies and volunteers from the great powers and ideologies of the time, most notably the tyrannies of Soviet Communism and German/Italian fascism.     There is no facile characterization of heroes and villains on this book. Most of the narrative zooms in on the struggle of a small band of mountain guerrilla fighters who are summoned into near-suicidal action by the arrival of American volunteer Robert Jordan with orders from the Republic. That you know in the great scheme of things their call to sacrifice and their violence is just another futile exercise in a brutal war makes it all the more poignant. And Hemingway adds enough insight into the workings of the greater armies and the machinations of politicians so the reader experiences the bigger picture as well.    In the book you find an intimate tale of struggle and courage in time of war, a moving love story, a critical view of the ideologies and idealism of the era, a couple of short-stories on bull-fighting, brutally honest accounts of war atrocities (from both sides) and moments of introspection in questions of love, life, death and hope that are as deep and moving as any. But don't forget about the adventure and suspense: Hemingway was a man of action and this is a book of men and women on a mission. You will be hooked and on the edge of your seat all the way to the (bitter-sweet?) end.    The last chapter is the most gripping piece of fiction I ever recall reading. It is unbelievably good... and Hemingway proves one more time he is a master of story endings.
0061478784|5.0|This book is beautifully written and was the first Diana Wynne Jones book I read. It made me want to read all of her other books.<br />The ideas behind the book are so different and creative it makes your mood lighten up with it and want to be in that world.<br />A wonderful book for children and anyone who loves a sweet romance story.
031606792X|4.0|Wow, lots of people are really ticked off about this book. There were some strange things...things I didn't LOVE about it, but it ended the way the author intended. I guess it is hard sometimes to \\"tie up\\" the story when you have lots of stories going on.<br /><br />Spoiler...<br /><br />I did HATE the part that Jacob imprints on Renesmee. Yuck. Weird. Strange.<br />I thought the part with the Volturi showing up at the end was somewhat dull. The blood bath during the birth was not what I would have wanted to picture for them but parts were somewhat humerous. But, the rest of the book I loved. I am happy that Edward and Bella got their happy ending. Now that I know that, I can go back and re-read the whole series and breathe. Maybe enjoy it more. Because at least I know everything works out.<br /><br />Plus, being a clumsy girl all of my life, I felt happy for Bella when she became a strong, talented vampire. Did we want her to be a vampire and still be clumsy? So many are complaining about that and how that was part of the zest of Bella. I agree, it was, but it no longer is nor should it be once she had been \\"changed.\\"<br /><br />I think my favorite book was probably Eclipse. At least I knew that it was going to work out and all of the pain in New Moon was worth it. The writing is better in the first 3 books but I am not one bit sorry nor did I enjoy it less because of that.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|Knowing about the 2.5 hours length, I could not justify watching more than half hour of this talkative, violent and meandering routine.
B000VFGQUC|5.0|Finally, the complete package. Full length song performances from two complete concerts, a half-dozen TV performances, and detailed interviews with the surviving members! A must-own for any fan of this band or rock and roll in general. Forget all the rock review DVD's and their ten second clips and get this!!!
B000CNESU8|5.0|I can't say anything more than what's been said, but I'll say this; a movie made over 30 years ago was far ahead of its time for a reason...it was a warning. We are coming to a point where people will be screaming out their windows, \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!\\" Do yourself a favor and watch one of the all time greats (and becoming greater).
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This review is written for those who know they want to purchase the movie. Therefore, these short paragraphs will not be about whether the movie is good, but why you should or shouldn't buy the BluRay Disc, instead of buying the DVD version or downloading it through Netflex, Amazon, iTunes, etc.  Obviously, the difference between the DVD/dL version and the BD version are the extra features (and the higher picture quality).     Wall-E definitely is loaded with content, and some easter eggs as well.  There are deleted scenes, interesting commentaries, quirky short clips, the \\"Making Of\\" (which is great), and much more.  However, these features are found in the DVD version as well.  The only difference between the DVD and BD versions (other than picture quality) are the games, a bonus short film, \\"Burn E\\" and a tour through the Axiom ship.     To be honest, the bonus short film \\"Burn E\\" was great, but the games...  I found this to be boring.  The 3D tour of the Axiom ship, is nothing to get excited about - the video rolls are you fly through the corridors of the ship. wee. The commentary on the BD version is not found on the other versions because of its Pop-up nature (which can only work on BluRay players). This was a great treat, but I'm don't know many people who actually look forward to commentaries other than myself.    In short, if you like the extra Burn-E video (which comes with storyboards, etc.) and great commentaries, its definitely worth the purchase.  Otherwise, download the HD version from whatever download service you use or upscale the DVD.
B00005R24K|5.0|I've watched this one so many times I've stopped counting. I think this one falls in the lines of either you loved it or couldn't stand it. I love this flick, it ranks up there for me as The Ultimate Cabin In The Woods Movie! Grab your popcorn and get ready to have lots of gory fun!
B0014DCTCY|4.0|This a great record from start to finish.  Some have said it is a departure from their earlier work and fault it for not being as \\"rootsy and simple (In style).  However I believe the work they have done on this record with producer Danger Mouse ( gnarls barkley, gorillas) has enhanced and furthered their sound.  Check it out!  If you have a turn table buy the vinyl.  It comes with a CD version inside.

B00005R1N3|5.0|For me this is the scariest movie of all time! I remember how bad it freaked me out when I first saw it back in the 80's. This one still gives me the chills and even though I own it and have seen it a buch of times it's still the only movie I will not watch alone.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This is a great DVD to own for anyone who is a fan of movies of this era. The performances are over the top, the dialogue is sheer camp and the costumes, well, just say that any \\"drag queen\\" would love hanging them in his/her closet! What a hoot! The add-ons are just as entertaining as the movie itself. If you are in the mood for a good laugh while being thoroughly entertained, purchase this DVD, invite a few friends over and make a party of it!
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Accept's 1983 release of \\"Balls to the Wall\\" is one of the true cornerstones of the genre.  After attempting to hone there sound on there first few releases,they came to perfection on the previous year's \\"Restless and Wild\\",arguably the heaviest album of the time.  Accept melded that sound the next year,simplifying the structure for more accesibility,but not compromising the heaviness resulting in one of the best produced Heavy albums of the decade.  To this day this album is among the top 100 essentials that one must acquire if they want to build a proper Heavy Metal collection.    Each track is a classic,and many would rate among the band's classics.  What has always impressed me,was the versatility offered this album,it's tone's and styles changing song to song.  It's often difficult to properly classify what sub-genre Accept has forged here.    The Tracks:  Balls to the Wall-The album opens with one of the most iconic Metal riffs of all time and the most well known song of the band's career.  A classic anthem to the constraints of society(and in particular,the metalhead)comes through in this timeless classic,which sports one of the most addictive choruses of all time.  The promo video was a hoot!    London Laetherboys-Despite what many percieve as a song about homosexuality,it's more a tribute to the Metal movement that was in Britain,which arose from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.  It has a good steady riff,and is kind of AC/DCish in it's style,but is a classic track.    Fight It Back-Awesome speedster that recalls the relentlessness of the previous album,with a typically commanding vocal by Herr Dirkscheider.  Sort of a deep album track,but lots of fun.    Head Over Heels-Great guitar here in song about falling for someone,yet it's lyrics are far from any love song YOU'VE ever heard!  Another hooky chorus that will be stuck in your mind for awhile.  Good soloing too by Kaufman and Hoffman.    Losing More Than You Ever Had-One of my favorites of the Accept catalouge,this underlooked classic features some of the band's best lyrics dealing with betrayal and heartache to devastating effect bya  particularly powerful vocal performance by Udo.  The Guitar work is among the best the band ever did,and I must say,this is one of the album's classics.    Love Child-HEAVY riff and pretty fast,sort of recalls Priest in song that also gets confused as one about homosexuality(that line about getting hot at the guy passing by!) is actually about a fairly promiscuous young woman who is after men.  Odd subject for a metal song,but most don't know that alot of Accept's material was written by a  woman!  This is one of the band's classics,anyway.    Turn Me On-Highly sexual song has  a certain urgency that reminds one of Priest's \\"Burnin Up\\" from there Hell Bent for leather(1978) album.  This song is another riff classic that features some of Udo's best vocals.  Still appears in his live sets.    Losers and Winners-Good time accessible metal that has a pop edge,but like everything else on the album,still packs a punch.  Nice deep album cut,not talked about a s much as it should.    Guardian of the Night-Awesome mood piece that evokes memories of Priest and Dio and Accept's own,\\"Princess of the Dawn\\" is a Power Metal song about a denizen of the nighttime.  A CLASSIC chorus and nice classical intro combine to create one of the band's all time masterpieces.    Winterdreams-The closer of the album is another mood piece in the form of an out right ballad,and a damn good one at that.  Unlike many of the Hair Metal Power ballads that will \\"poison\\" the remainder of the decade,this song features good,emotional lyrics and a vocal performance by Udo that clearly shows he's a man of versatility.  A beaut of a solo by Wolf Hoffman,and alot of emotional power combine to create one of the best ballads in the genre's history.    The beautiful re-master of this Cd,also sports some good live cuts of Head Over Heels and Love Child,which were extras fromthe live in Osaka,1985 show.    Excellent Metal release of a truly great band.  If you don't got this title,than you got your balls to the wall....man.

B0000524CY|5.0|I know I won't. After all these years it's still one of the scariest most shocking movies of all time. This one and Last House On The Left I had to sneak to see as a kid and boy was I in for a big suprise. An now as an adult I rank it up there as one of the scariest horor movie classics of all time.

0895260131|1.0|The Author has no clue whatsoever on what Islam is all about, he has totally missed the point of the message of the Apostle Muhammad, the last Prophet from God, the Almighty.<br />I really feel sorry for the author to be misled in such a way as to waste his effort to write on a subject that he has no understanding of...what a waste of time...and how biased and full of hatred he has shown to be...<br /><br />All his writings are taken out of context and without any serious scholarly understanding of the events that took place during the prophethood life span of 23 years (10 in Makkah and 13 in Madina)....there was not a single instance where the prophet peace be upon him waged a war or a battle on a group or nation unless it was in self defence. More than 80 percent of the life of the prophet was spent in peace and not in war and even when there was a war he was most merciful and kind to the pow's and distributed the booty to the needy and poor early believers.<br /><br />In short, the message of Islam is a message of peace and of mercy and harmony with the creatures and the universe and should not to be judged by what some few idiots are doing in the name of Islam and the media is blowing these incidences out of proportion.<br /><br />Whether the author likes it or not, Islam is the only divine truth that has prevailed on all systems of thoughts and current bankrupt secular ideologies. There is no escape but for all of us to return to God and worship Him as dictated in the Quran (His Last Word to Mankind) and the purified sunnah (tradition) of the Last Prophet, Muhammad, Peace and belssings of God on all His Prophets (Noah, Ibrahim, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad).<br /><br />\\"Say, (Oh Muhammad), O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship.

B00003CXC7|5.0|L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a dashing photographer who usually spends his time out in the field getting the most exciting and difficult shots.  Unfortunately, while he got a fantastic photo of a crashing race car, he also got a busted leg and is laid up in his second floor apartment in a cast.  For seven weeks (and one more to go) he's had nothing to do but watch the neighbors whose apartment windows all surround the same courtyard.  But very late one night he hears a scream and notices one neighbor (a salesman) making repeated trips out into the rain with a large samples case and his nagging wife has disappeared.  Jeffries becomes convinced the man killed her.<br /><br />The entire movie is shown from the point of view from Jeffries' apartment, and illustrates perfectly Hitchcock's genius.  He tells the story by what he shows with the camera (pay attention to the very clever opening sequence for a good example), by what Jeffries sees and does, and what you see of the neighbors.  Has a murder really been committed?  Hitchcock interjects subtle humor throughout, from Jeffries and the various neighbors, such as \\"Miss Lonelyheart\\" or \\"The Newlyweds.\\"  And when Hitchcock decides to turn on the suspence, he turns it on all the way.  One part I found slightly unbelievable is Jeffries' resistance to his beautiful girlfriend (Grace Kelly) who offers repeated hints about marriage.  C'mon, Grace Kelly?!?  What's he waiting for?<br /><br />But it's all part of Hitchcock's larger theme here, and this movie was lots of fun to watch noting how clever Hitchcock is and looking for his cameo appearance (and I'm not really much of a film buff).  There is also an entertaining documentary included with the \\"extras\\" that talks about the challenges, such as filming in such a small space.  An excellent movie from a director on a level with few others.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I am thrilled to own my own copy of the timeless classic \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" One really doesn't have to wait until it is Christmas time to not only view a great movie, but also to ponder the contribution each of us makes to the environments in which we live and work.
B001HN697C|4.0|For those who actually wanted to see some of the back-stories alluded to in the first two \\"Underworld\\" films, you should find \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" to be very helpful. This prequel not only visualizes the beginning of the blood feud between the Vampires and the Lycans, it also tells the story of Lucian (Michael Sheen), a Lycan of unknown parentage who would become the most powerful leader of his clan centuries later. For those who were never into the films to begin with, you might find that this new film actually has something to offer. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it delivers exactly as it promises: It's a supernatural action film that gives us no more nor less than a vampire underworld and a Lycan uprising. If you were hoping for a fable that's just as complex as it is frightening, might I suggest you stop reading this review?    One of the reasons I enjoyed this movie is that it takes place in the Dark Ages. The first two films took place in the present day (respective to when they were theatrically released), where vampire and werewolf clans coexisted with concrete structures, high-tech guns, and subway stations. It was a blending that was too bizarre for its own good. But in the context of immense stone fortresses, no electricity, filthy dungeons, medieval weaponry, and dense forests populated by peasant folk ... well, it just feels right. It helps that practically every scene is engulfed in shadow, effectively muting the visuals to shades of blue and gray. The color scheme establishes mood so well that it's hard to dismiss it as mere eye candy.    The back-story: Centuries before he became obsessed with the bloodline of Alexander Corvinus, Lucian was unceremoniously born in a dungeon. The cruel Vampire elder, Viktor (Bill Nihy), spared Lucian but killed his parents, making him the first second-generation Lycan allowed to live. When it flashes forward to Lucian's teenage years, we see him defeating a number of ruthless Death Dealers. Thisimpresses Viktor so much that he immediately devises a plan: He will create a new generation of Lycans to guard the Vampire coven from outside forces. With the help of a silver-barbed collar, they will be \\"civilized\\" Lycans. They will not be like their \\"wild\\" counterparts that roam the forests as wolves, unable to assume a human form.    Now we get to the story proper. Unbeknownst to Viktor, his headstrong daughter, Sonja (Rhona Mitra), has fallen in love with Lucian. Complicating matters is the fact that Lucian is planning on escaping, and he wants Sonja to run away with him; she loves him with all her heart, but there are times when she feels duty-bound to secure the legacy of the coven. She's willful and independent, much to the chagrin of her father, who relies on his conniving right-hand man, Vampire historian Andreas Tanis (Steven Mackintosh), to keep a close eye on her. As he stealthily observes Sonja and Lucian, it becomes clear that a Lycan uprising is in the works, Lucian having won the support of his fellow slaves.    Now that I've described the plot, I realize that I've been writing under the assumption that you're familiar with the \\"Underworld\\" series. If you're not, if you've never heard of Lycans or Alexander Corvinus or any other character I've mentioned, chances are \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" will not do very much for you. That's the inherent problem with prequels: They assume audiences are familiar with will happen later in the story. But since I am familiar with the film series, I was able to enjoy this film, mostly for its stylistic approach. The story, I admit, is fairly run-of-the-mill, giving us nothing new in the way of character development or theme. Consider the fact that the feud between the Vampires and the Lycans is essentially a commentary on intolerance and cultural understanding; I've seen such commentaries before, even as recently as another werewolf fable, \\"Blood and Chocolate.\\" Still, \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" makes the most of what little it has, so in that sense, the film succeeds.    Noticeably absent from \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" is Kate Beckinsale, whose character apparently wasn't born when the story took place (or maybe she was--I can never tell when it comes to Vampires). Rhona Mitra does a fairy decent job assuming the female lead, however, and this is despite the fact that she isn't given much to do other than be Michael Sheen's love interest. Sheen himself does an adequate job as Lucian, a character I could never quite put my finger on in the previous two films. Bill Nighy doesn't stretch too far for his role, but then again, he doesn't have to; for the purposes of this story, Viktor need not be more or less than a classic, uncomplicated villain. One look into his obvious, piercing blue eyes will convince you that the writers never wanted to delve too deeply. The same can be said for the film as a whole. \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" is a film meant to be enjoyed at face value. There's no point in trying to look past its gothic atmosphere when that's all you were meant to see.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Like a couple of other reviewers, I cannot wear the earbud type of earphones. The earphones that hook over the ear give me a headache after awhile.         I use the public bus system to get to and from work and I can't be without earphones. The last time I bought these last year, I bought two pair.  I'm currently on the second set.      These earphones are extremely comfortable. The only cons to these earphones is the wire is a tad too short and the second, you have to make a conscious effort to not pull or tug the wire too hard or the connection will be lost.  That's why I gave it four stars instead of five. I'm about to order two more pairs because I can't be without my earphones. Thank you, Amazon for carrying them!  :D
031606792X|5.0|The book is so great I have told everyone that I know to buy it. Two thumbs up.
B001HN697C|4.0|First off, let me just say that I am a fan of the \\"Underworld\\" franchise and I do think that Kate Beckinsale is one of the most beautiful women on the planet. Plus, I am also a sucker for tales about vampires and werewolves. That said, this newest installment of the franchise \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" doesn't have the previous two films' director, (although Len Wiseman still has credits for the story) and the absence of Beckinsale is of course to be expected (she is also married to Len Wiseman) considering that this film is a prequel and has taken place before Selene's timeline. Seems like Hollywood have listened to the \\"cries\\" of die-hard fans of the franchise, and delivered a fun installment in a gothic period.<br /><br />In an undisclosed time in the past, the coven of vampires ruled the land, using slaves in the form of Lycans to protect their empire. Lucian (Michael Sheen) may well be the first Lycan to be able to turn into human form at will, and for reasons of his own, vampire leader Viktor (Bill Nighy who reprises his role from the first film) decides to spare him and keep him as his \\"favored\\" slave. However, things get a little complicated when Lucian develops an undying love for Viktor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) and dreams of freedom for his Lycan brethren. Now, the lines have been drawn, and the war between Vampires and Lycans is about to begin....<br /><br />Patrick Totopoulos is now in the helm as director of \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" and while I'm not very familiar with his work, I have to say that Totopoulos does know how to make an effective monster feature. The werewolves looked very nasty and feral, even downright dirty, while the vampires have those blue contact lenses and wears fancy medieval armor. The screenplay does stay true to the mythos of the original, but it also nicely blends hyper-kinetic violence, with a Shakespearean \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", medieval backdrop in quite a modern fantasy film about the roots of the struggle between the mythological creatures. This prequel does take a life of its own, and while fans are in very familiar territory, the film doesn't exactly alienate new viewers.<br /><br />The filmmakers does stay within the style and feel of the original film with the gloomy cinematography, bluish muted color schemes and the action sequences carry quite a bit in blood and gore elements--and those scenes are nicely placed. The action in \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" consists mostly of swordplay--beheadings are aplenty, limbs are torn and bodies are mutilated. Amid the CGI generated set designs, I was somewhat pleased that this prequel didn't exactly build upon the franchise's past mistakes but it develops a fresh angle on the \\"Underworld\\" mythos. There are familiar characters to be seen in the film, and there are subtle hints of things to come. The film also enforces a gothic element that wasn't fully realized in the first sequel, and the screenplay does give room for its performers to have touches of melodrama, complete with very cool, moody posturing.<br /><br />I supposed the film's main strength will have to come from the effective performance of its cast. Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy does give a very heartfelt performance. Their chemistry as leaders of opposite sides are very nice to be privy to, as their interactions prove to be the film's central focus--a good move by the director since it proves to be a credible plot device to get the franchise's established formulas and romantic tragedies' groundwork. Rhona Mitra is a refreshing presence and proves convincing enough as Sonja, the one major catalyst for rebellion of the Lycans. Of course, fans of the franchise knew exactly what happened to her, and the film just fleshes out her relationship between Lucian, her father and the other vampires.<br /><br />The film also touches on the vampires relationship with the humans living during this time, and as to how the humans managed to become the dominant species in our present time. The Vampires coven's \\"Death Dealers\\" were supposedly the guardians of the human populace, who protect them from the beastly werewolves. Apparently, werewolves are those infected with no ability to change back to human form, and in this manner the commentary on social status is reinforced. Werewolves are to be killed on sight while Lycans are used as slaves. There is also some commentary on the politics of this mythical world, vampires rule, Lycans serve and humans provide silver. Werewolves are the outcasts. The vampires would do anything to hold onto their power base.<br /><br />\\"Underworld Rise of the Lycans\\" may indeed be better than \\"Evolution\\" and the film does succeed as being a passionate period horror adventure. There is very small window of opportunity to further build on its mythos and it does do so quite well. The film's weakness may well be that being a prequel, it is difficult to offer that many surprises, if there are any at all. The film is a fun experience and highly entertaining to fans and even to those not familiar with the franchise. \\"Underworld Rise of the Lycans\\" is a bloody, stylish, visceral, melodramatic installment to further develop the war between vampires and werewolves. It awakens the senses that this franchise is very much alive, and left me wanting more.<br /><br />Recommended!

B000I0QM04|4.0|The first time I watched this movie I thought it had the potential to be one of the great all-time sci-fi movies. Of course the story line was interesting but the hook was the time period - 1940's - and so the lure of art-deco production values. It's the kind of film that was 'good' on the old CRT as a rental but blooms into a Blu-Ray 'very good' movie on a 50\\" HD plasma . I call this the 'HD-GEE!' effect- hence the title of this review ( ahem ).    Look, either you like this type of movie or you don't. The actors are two-dimensional like comic-book actors would be, the story is outrageous, the pretensions are ever present, the star doesn't get the girl, the bad guy is snuffed by father time, the rules of time and space and speed and mass are broken all over the place but that's okay- THE BLU-RAY IMAGE IS GREAT ON MY BIG HDTV!!!     Does anything else really matter???

0060763280|4.0|I purchased this book mainly because I was interested in the section saying that \\"rich people are good receivers, and poor people are poor receivers.\\"  It's more difficult to be the receiver than the giver for many people.  They feel unworthy or feel as if they are obligated to return the gift, whether it is a verbal \\"you look good today,\\" or it's a gift of paying the bill at a restaurant.  Learning to be a good receiver is just as important as learning to be a good giver.  This puts us in the flow of wealth, instead of blocking it.  When we receive, all that is necessary is a \\"thank you.\\"
B000IOM0YC|5.0|This is an interesting story about the only American to be buried in the Kremlin(?) in then communist Russia- John Reed. I have to admit I like this kind of film because it shows real people being moved by real world events. How they react or respond or resist to the power that overwhelms them makes for great cinama when it's done right. And this movie does it right. Directed by Warren Beatty who won the Oscar for his efforts the presentation of the turn of events suurounding the Communist Revolution is clearly presented. Some great performances by Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton add major 'meat' to the body of the narrative.    Sometimes a little drawn-out especially when Beatty -playing the lead character John Reed - starts preaching to the Revolution leaders about his insistence that they not alter his writings ( he believes firmly in the power of communism and it's ability to save the American worker from the rule of the Capitalists and writes speeches for them about this ) and when he's trying to explain why Communism is a seemingly perfect economic system. But the scenes change quickly and the next stage in the revolution shows itself to be just as heartless as any other contrivance created by people determined to improve their economic plight.    The Blu-ray image is very good, the sound is very good, the bigger-than-life feel you get watching these people torture themselves and others is palpable to the extreme at times but the action moves along. I've noticed when I watch movies like this I find myself really grasping the jist of the story only after having viewed it several times. This is that type of movie. Watch it once and shun it if you will. But the 'Reds' Revolution will call you back at some future date and believe me, you will respond with enthusiasm.
1847245560|4.0|In THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, the second volume in the late Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, publisher Mikael Blomkvist and the police are conducting parallel investigations into three horrifying murders -- and their initial evidence points straight at young computer genius and social misfit Lisbeth Salander. Kalle Bastard Blomkvist (as Salander has begun referring to him) hasn't seen Salander in nearly two years, except for one night when he happened to witness a huge man attempting to kidnap her and both she and the attacker eluded him. He's bewildered about why she cut him off cold, but had accepted her decision -- until now. He doesn't believe Salander killed these victims. Well, at least not two of them. He has to contact her, find out how she's become embroiled in this, and help her. Salander, as usual, has her own ideas about who she'll see and when....<br /><br />In THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, Larsson partnered Blomkvist and Salander as they unraveled a twisted tale of corporate greed, Fascist connections, and perverse sex and violence. FIRE highlights another subject on which Larsson wanted to shine light, namely the underbelly of the sex trade, a swill of human misery being forcibly imposed for money and simple loathing of women. Blomkvist's magazine, Millennium, plans an issue devoted to the subject based on the interviews and reporting of a criminologist and a journalist, and there follows much in-house discussion of the lurid material and how it should be presented to the public. But the three murders turn the magazine and its people on their heads.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Salander travels, changes her appearance, and matures in the early chapters of the 569-page book that covers four months in total and is told in four parts. Among her pursuits: attempting to proof Fermat's Last Theorem in a way Fermat himself might have done, furnishing her new abode, and keeping tabs on Bjurman (whom, recall, she memorably tattooed in DRAGON). Then, she disappears for quite a spell as the murder investigation gets cranking, and finally, she regains the spotlight as the book rushes headlong into a heart-stopping denouement.<br /><br />The last book in this series -- tentatively entitled THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS' NEST in its English translation -- is not scheduled for release until 2010. However, the entire trilogy has already been published in Swedish (naturally), French, and German. Larsson reportedly had planned a ten-volume series. He had written part of the fourth book and had outlined volumes five, six, and seven. Sadly, due to his early death, only the trilogy is complete and will, according to his father, be published. After reading FIRE, the thought creeps in that perhaps the trilogy will not provide closure, and that the reader could be left dangling, unsatisfied. That would be a crying shame because Salander and Blomkvist -- along with other continuing characters -- do burrow themselves deeply into the reader's (at least this reader's) affections. Fortunately, reviewers who have read, in the other aforementioned languages, the entire story arc, including the final novel, seem generally very satisfied. Some claim that the last book, also the longest, is a grand finale that answers all outstanding questions. A few are less effusive, stating that the last book can't meet the anticipatory heights set by the stunning, unusual first one.<br /><br />This last criticism can be applied to the second book as well. FIRE does not pack quite the punch of uniqueness that DRAGON did. One can perhaps think of the movie trilogy THE MATRIX, MATRIX RELOADED, and THE MATRIX REVOLUTION as an analogy. The smash introductory film awed with its mind-bending perspective. The second and third passes were very solid, even amazing, partners, but they only reiterated the cutting-edge magic so novel in The MATRIX, building on it, not inventing something mind-blowingly fresh. Familiarity takes a bit of the bloom off the rose, but itcertainly doesn't breed contempt in these instances. Larsson's FIRE lags a little during the mid-section in which criminal investigation procedure grinds along and the author belabors certain points, seeming to believe his readers novices at crime mysteries. But overall, FIRE accelerates the enthralling story of Lisbeth and Mikael with panache. One can't help thinking the world they inhabit is too slimy, too vicious, but Larsson was a man with many crusades and causes, and his trilogy vividly paints the harsh pictures of society that he hoped to reform. The Millennium Trilogy encompasses uncompromising social critique; prickling thrills; and curious, bittersweet romance. FIRE drew me like a moth, and I can't wait to get my hands on HORNET. 4.4 stars.pt in these instances.

045122499X|2.0|This is a great book to take on a vacation, a long plane flight (2 way will probably be needed to finish it), or a long road trip.  However, if you're hoping to sit down with a well written novel, I'd suggest you pass.    My main problems with this book are that it is far too predictable, the characters are far too one dimensional, and the writing is lazy.    Early on in the book you can quickly pick out which characters are going to be good and bad.  It's clear before the characters are even out of their youth who will be the violent rapist and who will be the rich hero; that is forgivable and even a little fun.  However, when you're able to guess upwards of 90 percent of the plot well in advance, the book loses its ability to keep you engaged.    Each of the characters either falls directly on the side of good or bad, with one exception: Gwenda.  Gwenda is the only character I can remember having to make truly difficult decisions or at least decisions that would haunt a person for a long time.  Outside of that it almost feels as though each character is an unthinking robot programmed to behave one way and one way only.  I'm afraid the author's attempt to show Ralph as having some sort of conscience fails; seeking Merthin's approval despite his horrible actions doesn't really do much to show he's regretful.    Finally, the writing is just plain lazy.  ****SPOILER HERE****When Mr. Follet uses the plague to kill off Merthin's first wife and all of his in laws so he can go back and see Caris, that is just plain lazy.  At this point Merthin has been married to a young Italian woman for some time, and she has recently succumbed to the plague.  Follet dedicates all of about a paragraph wrapping up Merthin's feelings towards his now deceased wife and the past 9 years he'd spent in Itally. ****END SPOILER****  I made it about 50 or 60 pages past that and put the book down, and I don't think I'll be picking it back up.    This book isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't worth the 1000 pages you'll have to read to finish it.  My suggestion would be to get on Wikipedia and read the plot synopsis and save yourself a load of time for a better book.

B000OCZD5G|4.0|Could anyone advise me whether the audio soundtrack is in the original Australian version or the dubbed American (as was my NTSC Laserdisc version of the Road Warrior). I am from SA, Australia and have entered the world of Blu-ray. Without doubt Mad Max 2 (the Road Warrior) is my all time favourite movie. I hope not to be disappointed with the BD copy. I will purchase it either way.  Thnx in advance.
B00129H7VS|5.0|First of all if this isn't your genre then I won't convince you to get this movie, but if it is and you already have the dvd set as I do why get the bluray version?<br /><br />Well other than the added content the best reason is quality of the audio and video. I'm watching this on a sony 1080p 42\\" tv and Yamaha receiver for audio. Right away I noticed the clarity in the audio, the new audio improvements are obvious on my setup and that's where the all the goodness begins. As for the improved picture quality, my bluray player up converts rather well but in the first few minutes of the first episode, where Sobel picks the loose thread of Lipton's shirt from his new chevrons, you actually see the thread, and I was sitting 6 feet away, later on in other episodes you see the beads of sweat on some of the characters faces and can read the names on uniforms etc. I immediately popped the dvd version in the bluray player and couldn't see any of this on the dvd version, up converted by the player or the receiver which both do decent up converting. The added clarity in the audio, sharpness and detail in the picture makes watching this series over very worth while.<br /><br />Highly recommended, if you enjoy the series already, I won't try and convince you to like the show itself if you already don't but if you do like it the bluray version is worth it over the dvd box set, hell it's even worth it to get a bluray player to watch it if you already like it :-)
B000P12LWY|5.0|If you want serious history, you should be reading a book.  If you want entertainment with a historical base, television is a good choice.  I am not in a position to pick out the errors of omission and commission in this series.  How many there are is not important to me.  This is not a history lesson and I wish to be entertained.  As entertainment, The Tudors succeeds!  The acting is excellent, the settings realistic, the dialog intelligent and believable.<br />Henry the VIII is young, active, good looking and powerful.  He has two unfilled desirers, to have a son and to conquer France.  Season 1 has him working on both.  The King's favor is all-important, the series captures this and shows us why.  Without being boring, we are given enough background to understand the situation and see why Henry selects a course of action.  Many of his reason are not the best but this gives us insight into a complex personality.<br />While knowing the story, the telling is fresh and enjoyable.  I rented the first DVD from Blockbuster for 99 cents.  After the second episode, I ordered season 1.  This is on a par with Rome and Deadwood as enjoyable entertainment with some historical background.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Yet another great Miyazaki film.  No need to qualify \\"great\\" with \\"animated\\".  Miyazaki-san is a wonderful artist whose medium happens to be animated films.

B0011NVC98|3.0|The best part of this movie is the live actino animation.  I thought it was fantastic and was the only reason I continued to watch the movie.<br /><br />The movie started off well enough.  A nasty monster who had the town gripped in fear.  Than from the sea comes Beowulf, we are led to believe that he is the hero to end all heros, but there is no backstory to Beowulf.  I would love to no more about how he became such a warrior.  Than the queen has some issues with the King but they are not explored, and the Queen appears to have issues with Beowulf but once again no character development.  The overall plot seemed to be lacking and vague.  When the movie was over I asked myself really what was it about, what was the moral of the story?  I got out of that Beowulf was a hardcore warrior but not much else.<br /><br />I watched this on the recommendation from a friend and all I can say is that I was very disappointed.
0316776963|3.0|I read this book a month ago, but I've been sitting on the review for some time because I'm not certain exactly what to say about it. The writing itself is brilliantly done - Sedaris has a unique style of humor that is refreshingly funny. My favorite stories were about the time he spent in France (especially his struggles learning the language), as well as his description of his brief career as a performance artist.    But between the time I finished the book and the time I went to write this, I found an article from The New Republic titled \\"This American Lie\\", in which a reporter goes through some of David's more outrageous (and verifiable) stories. The verdict: Sedaris most certainly fabricated details of his supposed non-fiction book(s)... not just mere comedic exaggeration, but creating entire people/events/conversations out of his imagination. I give him some leeway because the purpose of his storytelling is obviously for entertainment only. But it's marked as non-fiction all the same, so there's supposed to be deference to the truth.    I know he's a great storyteller and an excellent author with heaps of life experience. So I don't see why he would feel the need to make things up to write about. The dishonesty ends up ruining the stories for me, not enhancing them. I got some laughs at the time. Now I just feel cheated.
0446579939|2.0|\\"The Lucky One\\", is a simple love story with heartwarming story and characters. The novel might be a bit predicable; however the novel has so much heart and soul that you want to unravel the conclusion. The book might not be the best Sparks book (I mean what could top \\"The Notebook\\" or \\"A Walk to Remember\\"). The book might be a delight to read, but probably would not be as memorable compared to other novels.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|The movie itself flowed well and was visually appealing.  I had a few real issues with the movie.  First of all the main chacater is a Jumper who is able to go from place to place in the blink of the eye.  He seemed to have had this ability from childhood, but never realized it.  He is 15 before he knows he can move thru space.  My question is how did he get this power.  Turns out there are other Jumpers, no one questions this?  Than there are hunters of the Jumpers....who the heck are these guys and wehre did they come from.<br /><br />It seemed for a brief second that there was a chance to make our Jumper a Super Hero, there is a scene with people drowing in a river the newscaster says they will need a miracle to survive.  The Jumper is watching on tv, does he go save them?  Turns out that the kid is a selfish young man who uses his powers to seduce the ladies and steal things.  Never once does he ask himself why he was given the power.<br /><br />The other issue was the relationship with his childhood sweetheart.  She thinks he is dead than he walks back into her life and he sweeps her off her feet, no questions asked.  She plays a way to gulable character and comes off as unbelivable.<br /><br />Take away all the negatives and the movie flowed well and was an easy movie to watch.  I will never see it again, but if there were a Jumpers 2, I would probably watch it.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I could do without a couple of the songs on the cd but overall Lady GaGa rocks the house.  I love her sense of style, she's borderline tacky, but in a good way.  I saw her on Jimmy Kimmell and it was enough to spark up interest to hear her music.  My standout tracks are \\"Just Dance\\", \\"LoveGame\\", \\"Poker Face\\" (it sounds like she's saying F!@# her face, yikes!), \\"StarStruck\\", \\"Paper Gangsta\\" and my fave track \\"Money Honey\\". I hate most of the other tracks but that's ok, you just want to blast the good ones loud and crank up the bass in your car.  Lady Gaga has a soulful voice bordering on Gwen Stefani and Dale Bozzio of Missing Persons. It will be interesting to see what Lady Gaga will do post \\"The Fame\\".

B000RIWAVW|4.0|In my eyes there are two categories of people when speaking of favorite holiday slasher films: those that like 1974's Black Christmas to those who rather prefer 1978's Halloween. Count me a part of the former's category, as Black Christmas is a forgotten perfected-diamond that not only chills the marrow, but is also intentionally hilarious in spots. Halloween, however, is a pretty good movie, damn near great in spots, in fact. Although it features scenes not only worthy of Psycho, and of which have found their rightful place inside classical cinema, yet the parts are indeed better than the whole. Halloween's approximate first 11 minutes and final 36 minutes (yup, I checked the runtime) are truly the reason the film is held in high proverb-- it's too bad that that only makes up a little over ½ of the film's total length.<br /><br />Halloween may in fact have a greater affinity for art-house horror fans like myself, than blood-and-guts fans, so I almost hate to say it, as Halloween I also remember fondly from my younger years, and it is one of those films that got me obsessed with horror, but nostalgia should never get in the way of being an honest and fair critic (or wannabe critic.) Halloween is a good movie, but damn that middle section sure is mightily flawed, and even seems cheesy in parts. Yet, the term arty can also be applied to the good parts of the film, as well.<br /><br />Yet, I hate to use that term \\"art-house horror movie\\", as that implies that horror is on the contrary, but I believe when viewing Halloween that it does in fact fit. This is due to the way John Carpenter directs the movie: stylish and relying on Hitchcockian-like suspense and a real sense of horror, rather than bodycount. I also must first point out that the dialogue throughout the film is actually one of the best components of the script. Often the everyday conversations about normal day things that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her school friends have does in fact seem natural, rather than boring. Though we don't necessarily \\"know\\" the characters all that well from a literary perspective, we do like them, as they seem like any real life type of girls that both you or I might know in high school.<br /><br />Yet, the overbearing dialogue exchanges between Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and the Sheriff (Charles Cyphers) seems necessary, it's also too bad it's not known until about that 55 minute mark. As the masterful opening scene, and its follow up \\"escape from the hospital scene\\" is long forgotten after about another 45 minutes of misstepping true scares. As although the mask-wearing Myers may be indeed a scary villain, not due so much to the ice-cold way he dispatches the characters, but much more due to the fact that he truly feels like evil incarnate. Yet, it also must be said that the way that Dr. Loomis perceives Myers in dialogue at first seems like it's overblown, lame, and not natural. What doctor really talks of a patient in high-strung, diabolical terms: \\"Death has come to your little town, sheriff.\\" To the films credit, however, although it at first slips into this \\"only in Hollywood\\" jargon, yet that is later completely evaded and it even becomes justified when we do later in fact agree with him in that final act when this \\"bogeyman\\" character is finally put and secured into a menacing night backdrop.<br /><br />Because, as good as John Carpenter is as generating suspense and menace in the terror scenes, in the initial daylight stalking scenes sadly lack that blood luster. As framing a character that your film makes out to the \\"The Bogeyman\\" not just in daylight, but also (hilariously) standing outside a school window just next to laundry, honestly brings a roll of the eyes, and a bad smile to my lips. Then having this evil character possibly hide behind bushes and a bed sheet makes me cover my eyes with my hands, shaking my head. Call me cynical, but it truly feels like two different kinds of films throughout the acts: a masterful frightshow, then a cheesy B-movie, and then back to a white-knuckle terror ride.<br /><br />In conclusion, despite that I still like Halloween and even if its opening scenes and final act are amongst my favorites, I must admit that in parts I can't really take the bogeyman threat that serious.  Sorry.<br /><br />Score: 8.0 / 10.0  (In 0.5 increments)B-movie, and then back to a white-knuckle terror ride.    In conclusion, despite that I still like Halloween and even if its opening scenes and final act are amongst my favorites, I must admit that in parts I can't really take the bogeyman threat that serious.  Sorry.     Score: 8.0 / 10.0         (In 0.5 increments)
B00023BLXK|4.0|Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is a movie that combines culture and dancing to create a distinct atmosphere. When I first saw this movie, I fell in love with it instantly. I think the actors did an amazing job despite the fact that the dialog was a bit corny.  The movie talks about two teenagers falling in love. This takes place in Havana Cuba in the 1950's right before the Cuban revolution.     The soundtrack in this movie truly ROCKS! All songs were very well selected and the actors danced amazingly. Javier (Diego Luna) and Katey (Romola Garai) shared unbelievable chemistry which made the movie more enjoyable. They performed the sexiest dance moves I have ever seen.   Although the plot is very similar to the first Dirty Dancing movie, it's worth to watch. The movie is certainly charming and exciting. You will not regret buying it. Plus you can always learn a few Spanish words while watching it =)
0790729652|4.0|Over the years, Batman has encountered a variety of wild adversaries but nobody has been interesting than \\"The Joker,\\" whether he was played by Caesar Romero (TV series),  Jack Nicholson (in here) or Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight).<br /><br />This re-introduction of Batman to the big screen in 1989 really got rolling when  Nicholson's \\"The Joker\\" came on screen. Then it took off and became wildly entertaining.  It didn't hurt that Kim Bassinger, meanwhile, was in her prime and looked awesome.<br /><br />Besides the stylish visuals, they didn't overdo the violence, either, and it wound up being a pretty good movie. This now 20-year-old series went through several Batmans before finally settling on Christian Bale. In this \\"opener,\\" Michael Keaton played the Caped Crusader and I though he did just fine.  I had no complaints with his portrayal.
B001F7MSFM|2.0|Hellboy 2 / B001F7MSFM<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Disclaimer: I liked Hellboy 1. There, I said it. I went into it expecting it to be a fairly lame superhero movie, but the action was cool, the  villains were nicely creepy, and we got a chick who could set herself on fire, which is more than you get from most movies. So I was looking forward to Hellboy 2, but in that wary, don't-get-your-hopes-up kind of way.<br /><br />Ugh. The only redeeming thing about Hellboy 2 is that it proves the adage that \\"a man who will die for you is nice, but a man who will live for you is better\\". Proving that Hollywood, once again, cannot portray a committed couple that isn't constantly fighting, Hellboy and Blair have \\"moved in\\" together, but Hellboy continues to be his slovenly self (he'll die for her, but he won't pick up after his eighteen cats) and Blair has been reduced by the sexist writers into a screaming hag who sets the apartment on fire twice a week because she doesn't get her way, rather than doing the sensible thing and maintaining a separate apartment, and/or getting a new superhero boyfriend to hang with. (Of course, also true to Hollywood form, an unplanned pregnancy will solve all these problems, since pregnancies ALWAYS strengthen rocky relationships, right?)<br /><br />If the movie wasn't unsympathetic enough to Blair, we ramp up the sexism with a character that SHOULD have been useful for more than just plot exposition and yet, bafflingly, is not. The Evil Prince, our antagonist, has a twin - a Good Princess - of royal blood, and with an interesting twist: whatever wounds one twin sustains, the other twin suffers from as well. This is a very interesting plot device, and the ending seems like it would almost write itself - the Good Princess needs to challenge the Evil Prince for control of the royal army. The Princess has the royal standing to challenge for control (only a member of royal blood may issue the challenge) and the fight for control would be an eternal stalemate - the Prince cannot harm or kill the Princess without harming or killing himself. The result would be haunting, poignant, tragic, as she and he stand down each other silently, for eternity, until their long lives run out, as the golden army patiently rusts around them, waiting for a victor that will never be declared.<br /><br />Instead...the Princess is relegated to a secondary character, as Hellboy challenges the Prince instead. This makes no sense. The \\"royal\\" standing that Hellboy has to challenge is, uh, the fact that he's the son of the Prince of Darkness. Mmkay. And since killing the Prince would be kind of churlish (as it will kill the Princess as well), the movie makers allow Hellboy to lose and the Princess to commit suicide as a Deus Ex Machina to bring the movie mercifully to a close. I guess they decided an \\"exciting\\" fight scene between Hellboy and the Prince would be cooler than a thoughtful showdown between the two twins, but I thought the change was a terrible one.<br /><br />Beyond that, nothing to see here. Blair is, as noted, annoying and Goth-y. Doug Jones returns as Abe Sapien, and yet manages to sound like a completely different person - I had to double-check that it was the same actor for both movies. The returning \\"tension\\" between Hellboy and his handlers is old hat, and the new monsters (and, indeed, the new plot) doesn't contain the same level of creepiness and terror we had in the original. I might watch the third movie, if they make it, because I'm mildly intrigued in the concept that Blair is now pregnant with the one destined to end our world, but I seriously hope they get some fresh writers.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollot harm or kill the Princess without harming or killing himself.
