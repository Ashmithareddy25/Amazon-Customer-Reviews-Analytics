B003MU2FNK|5|This is well worth the money. We did it with our four month old. Little need for child but definitely requires two adults. The impressions are extremely detailed. A bit time consuming and a little messy but very much worth it!!
B002R2BFVM|5|LOVE IT! THE GATE WAS REALLY EASY TO INSTAL, I LIKE THAT IT COMES WITH 2 SETS SO YOU CAN POTENTIALLY INSTALLED IT IN TWO PLACES. I LIKE THAT IS OCCUPIES NO SPACE WHAT SO EVER WHICH IS WAY NICE THAT THE METAL DOGGY DOORS WHICH TAKE UP YOUR HALLWAY AND SIT ON THE FLOOR COLLECTING DOG HAIR. I ACTUALLY INSTALLED INSTEAD OF IN THE HALLWAY SPACE I INSTALLED IN THE OUTSIDE SPACE SO IT LITERALLY TAKES UP NO SPACE IN MY HOUSE IT IT STAYS CLEAN AND NEAT.   THE OPENING MECHANISM IS A BIT HARD TO GET AT FIRST (MAYBE IT WAS JUST ME HA!) BUT ONCE YOU GET IT - IT OPEN EASILY AND YOU CAN DO IT WITH ONE HAND (VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE USING IT AS A BABY GATE AS USUALLY YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS PRETTY BUSY. RECOMENDED IT TO OTHERS ACTUALLY SEVERAL FRIENDS HAVE COMMENTED THAT IS WAS REALLY NICE AND WHERE I PURCHASED IT (AMAZON OFCOURSE HAHAHA) I USE IT FOR BOTH THE DOG DURING THE DAY WHEN WE ARE AWAY AND AT NIGHT I USE FOR THE BABY WHILE I COOK! WORK PERFECT
B00A2X30HK|4|Light and easy to carry around.  My little 2yo digs the CARS theme.
B004VL2VRY|3|I really like this baby monitor system, but in order for me to leave an honest review, I'd like to explain our experience. We purchased the single camera monitor when our first baby was born (summer 2012). It worked great...for awhile.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />-Camera quality was really great. You could see movement in real time without any delays or breaking up.<br />-Being able to move the camera around the room and zoom in and out is really helpful!<br />-The night vision quality is great! The room can be pretty dark and we never had a single problem watching our baby.<br />-I really liked being able to talk through the microphone in the camera by pushing a button on the handset. This two-way communication worked great for my husband and I to talk to each other while one was in baby's room. For example, I could ask him to warm a bottle or bring me a blanket and I didn't have to leave my baby unattended. We had a few middle of the night accidents where I'd ask him to come in and help me change the bedding without having to wake him up by setting him down in order to do it all on my own. As our son was older, sometimes he would be sad about going to sleep. We'd tell him, &#34;Lay your head down. Mommy and daddy love you and we're watching you.&#34; And he'd stop crying and lay down. This is great because it helped us teach him to fall asleep on his own but still feel the comfort of us close by.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />-Battery life was just okay. It seemed to die after 35-60 minutes. Maybe because the house is big, and the signal was straining...which brings me to my next complaint....<br />-The range was terrible! So baby's room is sort of in the middle. 2-3 rooms away is where our home office is. There's a bathroom and kitchen in between but side by side. It would repeatedly lose single and then start beeping because it was out of range. This was a problem because we weren't able to have constant monitoring very far in the house and never outside, but it also seemed to contribute to lower batter life.<br />-About 10 months into using this monitor, the audio went out. Video is nice, but sound is especially important for night time. All parents, especially new ones, need to hear if their baby is in any kind of distress or even waking up for a feeding. You don't want a sleeping baby to get so upset they start crying and screaming in order for you to hear because it's harder to put them back to sleep at that point.<br /><br />Pro: Motorola and BuyBuyBaby worked together to replace this for us under the warranty. They did not have the exact model available for replacement, so they sent us the newer version. The newer version had dual cameras. This was not only excellent customer service as we didn't ask for that upgrade, but also quite helpful because we had our second baby shortly after receiving the replacement.<br /><br />So now we have the two-camera version. It works pretty much the same. All of the things I liked and disliked about the first, single-camera monitor are the same.<br /><br />New features: Pros:<br />There is a scan option. This allows the handset to switch back and forth between Camera 1 and Camera 2 automatically every few seconds. I think it's like 6 seconds. This is helpful for two babies in separate rooms.<br /><br />It should be noted that you can add up to 4 cameras with either models. While they don't all come with multiple cameras, the additional cameras can be purchased individually. This could be convenient if you would like to place the cameras in different areas of your home without having to move them back and forth, even if you only use one or two at a time.<br /><br />Cons:<br />While the scan mode is helpful, those few seconds without video or sound can be a little crazy because you don't want to miss anything. There is no option to view on a split screen or listen simultaneously. I would prefer that as an option just because we need to know both babies are safe. You just never know sometimes....<br /><br />So fast forward a bit. Unfortunately our second monitor has also broken. This time it's the screen that went out. We can not view anything. It's like white and grey pixelated scramble. Since we can't see the screen, we also can't see the menu options. It's still set on scan mode so we can hear it switch back from one room to another. However, it's hard to tell which one is which sometimes, especially at night. The sounds still works, but we obviously chose a video monitor for a reason. Not being able to watch means that our son (now a toddler) can take his diaper off during naptime and pee on the floor in his room. Little things like that can and should be preventable to an extent. Toddlers will be toddlers, but we realized we relied very much on being able to always watch our babies.<br /><br />Upon contacting Motorola, I found we were one week outside of our warranty. I was told there is nothing they could do and we'd have to repurchase. I even asked if I could send it in and pay for a repair. After all, the cameras were fine, just the handset needed fixing. They said that was not an option and that was pretty much the extend of their customer service support the second time. So I guess if you go with Motorola, hope all the problems happen within the first year because after that, it's like the item never even existed to them.<br /><br />So my overall review is that this is a great monitor.....when it works. The known issues apparently are more common than I realized and since we missed our warranty by a week and they aren't going to help us, our investment didn't last for as long as we had planned. Because this problem happened to us twice, we're reluctant to purchase another Motorola baby monitor. We're currently looking for an alternate option. While searching through reviews, I realized that I should share my review on this one to help other parents.r know sometimes....<br /><br />So fast forward a bit.

B002CWGHZ6|5|Perfect for gifts!
B001V9EVCM|4|When I bought my breast pump it came with a few of the 5 oz bottles, but only one nipple assembly and lid.  So, we just wash them every time we use them.  And that's fine.<br /><br />The trouble is, now we're kind of living at two different houses.  So, I've been trying to remember to bring the bottle back and forth and I've had several times where it's been at the wrong house.  Also, I think we're ready for medium flow bottles.  My daughter is kind of skinny, so if nipple flow can encourage her to eat more, that's something I want.<br /><br />I had a lot of trouble finding just the top part, though.<br /><br />So, I bought these as sets.  That worked out to be the cheapest option.  They are fine.  My daughter doesn't eat anywhere near this much at once, but it doesn't matter very much.  She has also gained weight, but probably not because of these bottles--she only has bottles a few times a week--but she has started waking up to eat more during the night.<br /><br />Anyhow, it is what it looks like.  These bottles work just fine.<br /><br />I would have preferred more 5 oz bottles with medium flow nipples, but this is okay anyway.  We will probably use them later.
B004DC9TCQ|4|My wife and I shopped extensively for a 2 child stroller before settling on the Bob Revolution Duallie. As a matter of fact we bought and returned a cheaper stroller before ordering a BOB Duallie. We have a a 3 year old and a 1 year old. We walk in our neighborhood extensively and visit Disney World 4 times per year. We needed a good stroller that was going to be easy to push.<br />The Pros:<br />-The stroller is easy to push and steer. We looked at some front and back configurations but they were extremely hard to steer. This BOB is easy. You can push it and steer it with one hand. Even going up hill it isn't a problem. The stroller rolls effortlessly and you can hardly notice the weight of the children. The stroller had big inflatable rubber wheels making it easy to push and turn.<br />-The stroller fits through most doors. We were concerned with a side by side being hard to navigate through crowded shopping areas and fit through doors. Surprisingly we have only encountered a few doors in the last two years we couldn't get through.<br />-The shades are effective. They can pull down anywhere from just partially blocking the sun to completely closed. We have gotten stuck in the rain with this stroller and the shade kept the children dry.<br />-The stroller is sturdy. Our two boys are hard on everything. The stroller has made at least 8 flights over the last two years and we have never had any damage of any kind on the stroller.<br />-The wheel locks are easy to use and effective.<br />-The ride is smooth. The stroller has some bounce in it and takes bumbs with ease.<br />-The stroller is well balanced and can be easily tipped up to get over curbs.<br />-When folded down the stroller is relatively easy to store. It folds down to a nice compact size and latches to stay shut.<br /><br />The Cons<br />-For the cost it should include more accessories. The stroller does not come with a snack tray for the children or a beverage holder for the adults. They have to be purchased separately. For the cost of the stroller I think these should come included.<br />-The under carriage storage is useless. It is very shallow. There is a strap the comes down right in the middle of where you have to put stuff into it. It is so much trouble that I usually prefer to carry the item instead of going through the trouble of trying to get it into the basket.<br />-The fold up mechanism is a little difficult. You need to push two handles to start to fold it. Then once it is folded in half you have to pull a cable to disengage two  pins. The cable often doesn't pull straight and only one side unlatches.<br />-The adult beverage holder is very flimsy. It only attaches with 4 Velcro strops. Those 4 straps have ripped numerous times.<br />-With the snack tray in place it can be hard to put the kids in and out.<br /><br />Overall, despite it's short coming it is the best dual stroller on the market right now. I wish there was a prefect dual stroller out there but unfortunately there isn't. In the mean time, those looking for a dual stroller should go with the BOB despite the cost.
B007HZBNXY|1|I wanted to love these cups but the valve is impossible to clean and always ended up moldy. I loved the idea of being made from recycled milk jugs so I bought 4 and was very disappointed. These would be great id they redesigned the valve.
B001OC5UNK|1|I really hate this stupid gate. We have many baby gates, and this is the worst of them. It's flimsy, unstable, and extremely difficult to use – forget using it one-handed and EVER having it reliably close behind you. Over time, all the parts come loose and get misaligned. It really is junk. I regret ever buying it.
B00LYCR718|5|These towels are very soft and remain so after many uses. I haven't washed them yet though. My mother is very pleased with them as well, having used them for herself and her grandson. She said the towels could be a bit larger, but clearly they are designed for the little ones. Colors are pretty.
B0097GUCZ6|5|For folks who are wondering, this is the exact same product as the Lansinoh &#34;Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier&#34; sold at Target. They have the same item number on the back of the bra, but for whatever reason, at Target it is sold through Lansinoh for $35.00 instead of this lower price on Amazon. I bought my second one from Amazon because I'm so happy with the first, which I've used for three months now. The elastic is still strong, and the pump phalanges continue to stay in place well. What I like about this bustier compared to others is that it has straps, which I rely on when putting in the pump. Little things like that can save time when I'm on the clock at work. Also, fyi, the bustier fits both the standard Medela and Pumpin' Pals phalanges just fine. An excellent product .
B0043D28B4|5|My 5 month old son loves this book. The crinkle pages and lovely colors completely capture his attention.
B000MHXFTO|4|Used double sided carpet tape and its stuck on really well. We use it on a step in our living room and though it hasn't been put to the test it feels like it has great impact absorbency.
B002VWZU7S|5|baby loves!!!!
B007F9YPBO|5|Even though it has two recline system, unit it quite big and my daughter really loves this.
B001WAJVZM|5|If you are concerned about mold lurking in the bathroom, but at the same time want the comfort of knowing your child is safe , this will do it.<br />I had the typical rubber duck spout cover but it was constantly getting moldy. I watched my younger brother as a baby hit his head off the bath spout, so<br />I have always been terrified that it could happen to one of my kids. Over the past 12 years they have developed better products and this is the best so far.
B00J2C6THA|5|My baby loves this!
B00ECFOV7W|5|So adorable, great quality.
B00CAFTX2Y|4|The colors are quite nice and pastely, and the rug doesn't slide around on my floor. :) The rug is soft but not plush/fluffy. It's also smaller than I thought, then again I was expecting it to be big enough to exercise on. I must be stupid because I didn't pay too close attention to the measurements. Overall, great rug!
B00AEEA1W4|5|The beep beep musical  mobile with cars is very cute. It matches the bedding and plays the music for sleeping. The mobile is perfect<br />size for our baby's room.
B00008612G|1|I got it as baby shower gift. I was going to return it but it looked like it would come in handy. Big Mistake, my son doesn't like it, the vibration it not strong enough for the baby to feel. Don't buy it, If you get it return it. It is a wast of Money &amp; space. It just takes up room in my house. Looke cute but no good use.
B000GUZC2A|4|hoping will work as advertised bought for my Grandchild to be
B0012LXZ4O|4|They work as drool bibs.<br />Would have preferred side Velcro.
B00XBIUSQO|2|Don't react to the sound.
B001N4LE5M|5|This is the 4th crib mattress we've purchased, and it's the first one to actually fit in the crib, snugly, the way it's supposed to fit.  All the previous mattress we bought were just a little smaller than the standard sized crib we had - even though the mattresses were all supposed to be standard size, too.  We had to use a bumper to fill in the gap around the smaller mattresses, and we were definitely not happy about that.  This mattress fits beautifully in the crib, and is light, soft, and wonderful.  Plus, I love that there are no springs.
B00I5P7IES|4|Great inspiration in my room
B004Q0NSPO|5|Since I have a very small frame and I am only 5'2 size small was the best. I was so happy that they offer step by step instructions on all the many ways to wear their scarfs online and in the package. They were also very easy to read and understand. Honestly I had a blast trying all the different ways to wear it and well my hubby got to take pictures of me. I couldn't believe how a scarf can make a white shirt look so elegant and fancy. The 1st way was I tied it around my hair/head and I loved that because I have always done this in the summer but not with a scarf like this. Then the 2nd one was I put it over my head and just draped it done my back with was simple and easy. The 3rd one was I just simply put it over and laid it the way I liked. Then the last one I just tied it around my neck. Such simple easy ways to make a scarf look different no matter what mood you are in. This would be great for basically anything church, a nice dinner date, vacation, shopping pretty much where ever you want to wear it is completely up to you.
B001KK6I8M|4|Such a great invention!  I love it.... I recommend 2, one for home and one for the diaper bag!
B005IV0CRM|5|awesome baby nail scissors! a must have!
B003BXUU8U|5|Very soft and comfy. My dog, a teacup chihuahua loves playing with it in her bed and pet taxi. Easy to launder and comes out looking brand new.
B00JT475Q0|4|The cor is very vibrant & it's a very roomy/easy to carry comfortable bag, but it is very obvious that it's a &#34;diaper bag&#34;. So if you don't want to hear the baby-bag comments maybe this bag isn't for you. I personally love the quality & the color, but I constantly get asked if its a baby-bag (ugh)!. But I'm very happy with the purchase & I love the color & I use it for work every day.
B0007VU4KI|1|I purchased the Tote n Go Car seat thinking how great it would be for traveling and as any extra car seat when I had to transport other kids.  I tried multiple times to install this car seat and each time I could not get it tight enough so that it wouldn't move from side to side.  I struggled for long periods of time and finally decided it just didn't deliver the ease and convenience from the desciption. I returned it because I value my children's safety and I just couldn't chance their lives in this seat!  Don't waste your time or money on this one! It doesn't even deserve the one star!
B000JOOGR0|2|I like this cup however I don't like the spout.  My toddler bites on it and then breaks the seal over time.  I have yet to be able to find any replacement spouts in the stores. I have been to Babies R Us, Baby Depot, Target, etc. and no replacement spouts for the wide cups. They do have them at Babies R Us only for the regular size cups (no handle grip).  Once the spout is broken, they are worthless.  I would recommend getting the small mouth spout.  The new redesign is more durable to biting as well.  He has yet to break the seal on any of those.  These are VERY easy to clean.
B00295MQLU|4|I am very happy with this purchase. I honestly thought that the bra would not hold the flanges on my breasts and would cause milk would spill out, but thankfully, I was wrong! No leaks, no slips and the bra stays on me fairly comfortably the whole time I pump.<br /><br />The material is nice and thick and seems very durable. It has held up well so far.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars? I am a petite woman (small boned and about 115 pounds) that normally wears a 34A cup (obviously pre-pregnancy) and now am about a large 34C. For some reason I can't get the slits where you insert the flanges to line up with my nipples. I need the gap between the two slits to be smaller and closer together. Yes, I ordered the xs/small/med size and I do NOT use the extender. This makes lining up the flanges to my nipples a little awkward and it sometimes FEELS like the bottles aren't getting the full support the bra could provide for holding the bottles in place. I also don't think it is the easiest to zip up.<br /><br />Also, I read some reviews before purchasing this bra about how some women thought this \\"bra\\" was not flattering and wouldn't work to wear under your work clothes. I really can't imagine anyone thinking that a ginormous bra that resembles an Ace Bandage Wrap with two slits in front of your nipples would ever make a nice and flattering bra to wear under your clothes. What I am saying is don't get this bra thinking you can wear it under your clothes at work and then just take your top off and pump. You're going to have to change into this if you don't want to look like you have mashed potato boobs at work.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this bra and would purchase it again. I think with bra purchases like this where you can't purchase your exact cup size you have to realize the bra isn't going to fit like a glove and be your new favorite one to wear.
B00C7VEE8Y|4|considering the price was so low id have to say it was excellent. I love the cherry color it was gorgeourgus
B000UEA96G|3|I'd say this works, but make sure you give the strip plenty of time to process. Otherwise, you may end up unintentionally boozing up your baby.
B00OLEW5AY|4|Great cup. It was easy for my 3 year old and my 1.5 year old to figure out the spout. It will leak (just some drops) when dropped or thrown off the table.
B000F78UAU|4|Does what it's supposed to do. I use this often and am glad I bought it. If I had a bigger room I would have opted for a wide, cushy glider that's easy to fall asleep on, but with limited space this was a great option. After four months I haven't had any problems with squeaking, and at 8 months pregnant it was pretty easy to put together. I do wish it were easier to fall asleep in, but if you're tired enough you'll find a couple padded blankets thrown over the back and a blanket over the lap with baby will be enough to fall asleep for a little while. Best of luck with your choice!
B00O6AIY1M|5|Adorable! Fast shipping
B006ZN26KI|5|Beautiful
B00AVT0YKG|5|I bought these to participate in the monthly baby photos trend. These stickers are cute, go on smoothly and adhere well. They serve the purpose nicely.
B001VEWXJ0|5|We purchased two of these and we love them. We will be purchasing more of them and they maintain their color after they are washed.
B003VOW5IC|5|I love love love this little onesie!! I can't wait to see my daughter in it. The organic cotton is very soft and it still looks great after washing.
B006ZIST04|5|Love this seat. My oldest used one like this from 9 months to 5 years now my youngest has had it for 5 months and loves it. Easy to install and uninstall if we have to switch vehicles. And the print is adorable. Will pur hase for my future kids
B000PRUAFI|4|I love this gate.  It's easy to open, it swings close by itself (even though it won't shut closed if it's not alligned properly) and it stays wide open when needed.  It opens by lifting the actual gate up, so there aren't any latches that might break.  My only issue is the lock... I can't figure out how my dog (a 65 lbs boxer) is able to open it even when locked.  I might have to set up a camera to see how he does it.  Other than that, I'm glad I bought it.
B001V9KPBS|4|Most people don't know but you need to switch the nipple out. I traded it with my dr browns and it worked like a charm. The price is jacked up though. I used to pay 8$ per bottle at babies r us when they sold them.
B0038JE61O|5|This is a fabulous little tool to have in your dishwasher.  I bought it for the nipples and various baby bottle plastic pieces to make sure they would get thoroughly cleaned.  This basket does the trick.  The top red portion has spaces for the nipples so they will remain upright to insure cleaning.
B00GRS9XFW|5|My sweet niece is attached to hers!
B00SH3LGJ6|1|Didn't work at all! Wasn't compatible with our monitor when it states that it is. Had to send it back and go through Motorola- which was ok, and we were refunded.
B00GLS2JZ4|1|What a stupid stupid product. I am so bummed I didn't read a different person's review. This came with the 6oz purple cup, which is exactly what I wanted, as we have 4 other of the same. However, the replacement straws are the 8oz cup version. Why in the world would they do that? How stupid. DO NOT BUY this package. It seems like there are probably other seperate cups and straws you can buy, as I'm a big fan of Zoli - just not this weird kit of different products that don't work together!
B009YDCH2S|5|I bought this for my daughter, the design is super cute, is good size and you can fit a couple things inside of it. The only problem is that my toddler daughter walks way too fast, almost like running so every time I used this with her it makes her fall. I would say that I have not been able to use it because my daughter is so exited about walking that I cant control her. but, I think that this will work really well when she gets a little older. My recommendation to other parents is to start using it after your child is an experienced walker.
B000IDSLOG|5|Sophie is the new fad!! My 10 month old loves chewing on the ears. We take Sophie wherever we go! I've read reviews about the legs being a possible choking hazard, but as long as the baby is being supervised, there are no issues.
B004YZBIK8|5|This pack n play sets ups quick and is just the right size for sleepovers at grandmas. It is also easy to take to other places as it folds up small and isn't so terribly heavy.
B009KDODXI|5|Baby loves this filled with smashed fruit!
B000RLQZD8|5|Outstanding.
B0041RRZ1U|4|This is a cute and versatile bag. My only complaint would be the size. Its a little smaller than I expected and would want for my everyday diaper bag. But this one is great for short trips or outings and it actually looks like a purse too so thats a plus. I havent had it long so I cant attest to its durability but I love all my other skip hop products and their service is excellent.
B00U4EIMM0|5|Bebe Au Lait takes ordinary baby essentials and makes them beautiful!  Wet & Dry Bags are a must in my house with an accident prone, messy, car-sick prone 3 year old and a new baby!  Did I mention they are both boys?!?  These Wet & Dry bags are amazing to use.  They are the first ones I have owned with a dual zipper function.  It is a great design improvement.  They are built to last and the designs are beautiful.  Two big thumbs up!
B001988DRO|4|My daughter (5 months) loves this toy!  She hates tummy time and I can get her to do it if I place this in front of her.  She loves spinning the duckies and it keeps her entertained for as long as I leave it in front of her.
B002KML1DG|1|I Spent this much money for the bag to get a rip in it 1 week of using it after having my baby. Very disappointed!
B00ECHYTBI|4|We've been using the DXR-8 with our newborn and are very satisfied. The picture quality is great and it's got excellent range! I love the temperature sensor and the overall ease of use.
B005DU1YW0|3|The elastic on the other side is loose.
B004A15YSI|1|Did anyone keep the instructions to putting the crib together? I lost mine.
B004L2JJ6O|5|Folds up nice and flat! Bought to go on a vacation. And it got well in our suitcase! Now we store it in the car for those just in case we need it situations!
B007D1SK2Y|4|Super cute!! Looks really cute in my daughter's room. The only thing I don't like is that there are no sides to it so books can easily fall off, haven't had that problem yet though :)
B007DN3GNK|5|Cool
B001QIN6ME|5|Great product! We make out baby wipes for use while we are at home and this warmer works great for keeping them warm!
B0000CBGBS|5|I added this to my registry because i thought how cute is this, a baby papasan! i did not know however that this would be the most valuable piece i had asked for.  from the day i took my daughter home from the hospital to probably about four months old, i used this every day.  she slept in it during the day.  when i had to go somewhere, bathroom or laundry room I just picked it up and carried it with me. she loved the vibrations and loved i mean loved the lullaby.  i played it 24/7 she was colic so it just stayed on.  I will admit that that lullaby did start to drive me crazy.  So bad that i cant even listen to it anymore.  but you can shut it off if you want it was the only thing that would keep my daughter calm and asleep.  as she got bigger i still used it for carrying her around to different rooms and to sit and watch some tv and to feed her in.  i stopped using it totally at 5 months because she really started to sit up and push forward and she could fall to the side but it is not recommended for that age anyway.  this did not take the place of a bouncer though i got her a bouncer at a few months old when she could really bounce.  this was really great for when we brought her home from the hospital they just get cradled in the papasan.  i buy this for everyone even if they dont want it.
B00B361UZ4|4|I just love this highchair! We're doing a minnie theme for our baby and this is the collection we chose.. However, walmart has it for about $50
B00AOFZKCE|5|Love these cups for my 2 year old.
B00A2HUGYQ|5|Best. Car. Seat. Ever. Fits just fine in a 2012 Ford Focus for those with size concerns. My little man used to hate riding in the car with his Graco, but ever since we made the switch, it's been smooth sailing. Not only is his comfort imlortant, but the safety factors in place are paramount. I will never trust another company with my child's safety again.
B002FB7FLY|5|I've used this several times now.  It is very absorbant and the price is great.  You can't ask for anything else.
B004K4RYW4|5|I absolutely love these blankets especially for baby gifts. So soft and cuddly. They are a must! Great price too.
B00O7V52HE|4|Baby is only 1 week old but the swaddle works well.  It is easy to use and we love the fabric.  I think when she is bigger, it will work even better.  She is only 6 lbs.
B000GCE5C6|4|Toothpaste is nice, kids like it however brush is not much of use if your kids have teeth. They can easily bite your fingers.
B008WNV4RU|5|Excellent construction and lots of pockets. This color was a great price! This is the second skip hop bag that I have purchased. One for my wife - one for me.
B0009XBXKE|2|I thought I'd try these out since they were 1/4 of the price of the Huggies changing pads.  I got 1/4 of the quality... they are tiny and ultra thin.  Like an itchy paper towel with saran wrap stuck to the back of them.  If you want something you can lay down and actually be happy to change your baby on, this is not the product for you.
B005PWVIZE|5|My one year old daughter was really interest into playing with the hanging cord a couple times but she could not get the doors open.  The only problem is that the cord is little bit short.  Well maybe it is made that way for safety anyway.
B0071D1AKI|5|Love, love, love!  Great price, easy to install, and works like promised.  No more breaking my back trying to help my son wash his hands because &#34;I do it Mommy&#34;.
B001MS82HM|1|I purchased this for my friend who just has a baby in July. She used it twice and the procduct malfunctioned. I was so embarassed when she told me that the pump is no longer working. She had to purchase a new pump on her own. my advise, Do not purchase this product!
B0081ZOV06|5|ONLY ONES MY GRAND SON USES
B0007CQ6RW|5|The Baby Sitter is a stylish addition to the home with its modern lines and chic fabric. The build quality is superior to other bouncers. Our baby has enjoyed lying in it since she was just a few days old. She is now 4 months old and is able to rock herself as she moves her legs in excitement. She is also fascinated by the colorful teddy bear bar that is attached (and removable)to the front. The Baby Sitter has three positions to accommodate the baby's weight and age.  <br /> <br />Besides keeping my baby entertained with a nice place of her own to sit in, this Baby Sitter is also a chic addition to the nursery.
B002SG773W|3|This was a great help when my baby was 4-7 months or so. Once she learned to grab and pull things, these became useless as the velcro closure is very small and not very strong. If you're looking for an easy maintanance  washable bib for your younger infant, I say these are grreat. Just keep in mind that few months later you may still need to buy the ones that tie in the back or snap on.
B001LQCOIS|5|I love this little device - it doesn't take up too much space in the cabinet and is so easy to use and clean up after. I read the other reviews so I knew to start making food before my little one was ready for solids. This turned out to be perfect - whenever I see fruits and veggies on sale (over ripe organic bananas .35 / lb) or we have more than we need in the fridge I just turn it in to baby food. One batch in the Beaba fills an ice cube tray, which keeps me from making too much of any one thing. That way in the future if I want to serve chicken & rice with apples, I just thaw a cube of each and mix. If I had to steam everything in one set of pans, then get the big blender dirty I would give up on making my own baby food in a hurry! I love knowing exactly what is in my baby's food and being able to offer a much larger variety than what you can get in the jars - bell peppers, asparagus, mango, etc.     Skip the specialty storage containers - ice cube trays are perfect. Cover with plastic wrap, freeze, dump in to a Ziploc bag. Also skip the cookbooks - no need to create fancy mixes ahead of time and you'll start feeling like you are spending longer on baby food than dinner. I was disappointed that the Beaba did not come with basic instructions for categories of fruits, veggies, meats (just a few sample combo recipes), but I found this great website that has all the basics, fancier recipes, nutritional info - without paying anything or giving them your email address: [...].    Haven't encountered any of the \\"brown film\\" issues - being careful to take the lid off the steam compartment immediately and leave it off when it is put away.
B00GUN3Z1W|5|excellent product
B004VL2VRY|4|i wish the picture quality was better... but its totally good enough. very happy with it. has more than enough features to keep me happy.
B00318CLTG|3|Cup is great; however, if you Close it too tight then you will have major leaking...
B003YJF9JG|3|Pro: Eliminates fear of cutting skin<br /><br />Cons: Battery dies quickly and/or the battery compartment of my device was defective (I have to change or fiddle with the battery every 1-2 times I use it), pads wear out fast (also have to change them out every 1-2 times I use them mostly on the finger nails of my 4 month old) so you have to buy a lot of replacement pads
B00005BVK7|5|I first bought the Delux Symphony Zoo mobile which broke before my son was born.  (the motor)  I decided on this product which is wonderful.  My son loves watching it go around and I love that it stops periodically so he can focus.  The ocean sound is an added bonus.  This is one sound my son has really learned to relax to.
B0009OLUEC|5|I love this stroller and I'm very happy we made the decision to get it.  This is a very comfortable stroller with everything I was looking for.  Mainly - compact fold, full recline, and something that was compatable with my Britax Companion Infant Seat.  It's very comfy and my daughter loves to be in it.  I highly recommend this stroller... <br /> <br />I would like to address the issue that has been brought up by other reviewers saying that it doesn't fold with one hand - I AM ABLE TO FOLD IT WITH ONE HAND...here's how I do it.  I use my right hand to squeeze the release on one handle, then I use my right hand to squeeze the release on the other handle.  They do not have to be done at the same time.  You can definitely do one and then the other.  Anyway, after that, I pull up on the handle behind the seat, and it's folded.  All with one hand.  No problems.  The stoller is light enough to easily lift it into the trunk with one hand too. <br /> <br />Regarding the storage - for me it has more than enough storage.  I'm not sure if people realize that the basket has to be accessed from the sides - not the back.  It holds a lot, although I do hang a diaper bad on the handles and then just use the basket for my purchases.  I haven't had a problem with the amount of storage. <br /> <br />
B0064CTIC4|1|I had the 4moms baby bath tub that gives a constant temperature reading and cycles clean water through the tub throughout the whole bath, however my baby is sadly too big for ait now and we have transitioned her to the full tub. I wanted something to let me know what the temperature was still though, as I prefer steaming hot baths, I was afraid I wouldn't realize it if I got the water too hot for baby just by feeling it. This thermometer works great, and my baby loves to play with it during bathtime, but I pick it up and set it on the side of the tub to dry out as soon as I take my daugter out of the tub, and it doesn't seem to ever really dry out, as the next day at bath time it is still on, letting me know how cold the pool of water that has dripped out of it from the previous nights bath that it is sitting in is... I have tried propping it up too, so that the bottom is not flush on the tub surface so that it might air out better, but this hasn't worked. I hope it last a long time, but I am afraid it won't...<br /><br />UPDATE: broke/quit working after less than a month
B005F29SVA|4|I bought it for my babe girl, it's very soft and lovely, although my girl doesn't have so many feelings for her, but I think she will like it later.
B000GK7AMU|5|These are adorable! I bought them to replace some rubber duckies that got too moldy inside. These spent their first few days by the high chairs as a distraction for the kids while I prepped meals for them. Now they're in the tub, and both babies enjoy them. Crab and Turtle are definitely the favorites. They squirt pretty well. I plan to soak them in a bleach/water solution occasionally to prevent mold... don't want these ones to get gross like our duckies did.
B005AUYEHA|4|I love carrying my baby.  I have all different kinds of carriers--a Lovey Dud (moby-like wrap), a Maya Wrap (d-ring sling), an ErgoBaby Sport, and a Chic Papoose (pocket sling).  I like them all, but had always heard good things about the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN and wanted to try one to see if it was worth the hype.  In my opinion, it is totally worth it.  I am very happy with this carrier.  My baby is comfortable and happy in it and it doesn't hurt my back or shoulders.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Easy to get baby in/out<br />* weight is well balanced<br />* lightweight and not a lot of added heat (baby is hot, so having him close is going to be hot no matter what)<br />* simple to adjust<br /><br />Con:<br />* doesn't fold up easy--seems trivial, but it is difficult to fit into a diaper bag and carry with me<br />* can't take baby out easily without waking (Maya Wrap is awesome and my baby sleeps right through being put down after falling asleep)<br />* doesn't convert to carry on your back (the ErgoBaby does and will last you longer with your child)<br />* when putting on, I get my arms caught up in the different straps--another little nit, but it isn't a quick on sometimes when I need it to be<br /><br />My son is 3-months-old and fits in it easily.  He was 8 lbs, 4 oz and 21 in at birth, which are the exact requirements for this, so he could have been in it from birth.  I'm not sure how comfortable he would have been as a newborn, though.  I do really like the ErgoBaby because baby can be bundled up inside it without his legs sticking out which is how newborns usually prefer to be.  The slings are also great for a newborn.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN.  It is my go-to carrier right now.  I use it to carry my son around the house when doing chores or to go to the store.  I also used it recently when we went to a college football game.  It was hot and uncomfortable that day, but when baby was in the carrier he was happy (very unhappy and hot, so he didn't last long at the game).<br /><br />The price is a little steep for a carrier, but most are expensive.  If I had to chose to only have this one or the ErgoBaby, I would probably choose the ErgoBaby because it will last until the child is bigger and is more versatile (carried on your front or back)--with the added cost of the newborn insert, it is comparable in cost to this one (we never used the newborn insert as my son was 13 lbs with good head control at 7 weeks when we really started using it).  If you only plan to carry on the front, then I would go with this one.  It is completely worth it.ier, but most are expensive.

B00IQ1XD7C|5|No more worrying about accidents on their car seats... stays in place well too!
B00AHVR4KG|2|It is HEAVY and really hard to push and turn. Unless you are TALL the handle will probably be too high to be comfortable.<br />The front wheel locks but when when unlocked it can't figure out which way to point and just drags--so annoying.<br />Also the SUNSHADE works great if the sun is directly behind you. Otherwise, you might as well not use it because your child will bake anyway.<br />The STORAGE is large and handy to use.<br /><br />Overall, I truly hope there is a better jogger/ stroller out there because this one is rather miserable in many ways.
B0006H5WJ6|5|I too would have loved to have purchased this from BRU, but after several empty trips to the store and the product still being out of stock and supposedly on the way by..., my husband went online directly to the Kids Line website and ordered everything. We love the room though with all our hearts.
B00QD1K01E|5|I had never heard of this brand of crib mattress covers but wanted to try them out because my toddler has terrible allergies to many things and this one is supposed to be hypoallergenic. This arrived quickly in the mail and was well packed to prevent water damage and was as described. I received this at a discount to test and give my honest opinion.  I liked the fact that they are BPA, latex, and phthalate free. This cover was pretty easy to get onto the mattress as sometimes, in the past, I have had to struggle to get the covers on. I washed and dried the cover before putting it on the mattress and it didn't seem to shrink any. I put the cover on before bedtime last night and my daughter has a tendency for her diapers to leak.  Last night, her diaper did indeed leak urine and it didn't get onto the mattress which prevented the mattress from being permanently stained.  It did exactly what I wanted which was to keep the mattress dry and clean. This cover is nice and soft and made her crib a bit softer.  I really like this and I think it would make a nice gift as well.
B00129HNK8|3|It's MUCH softer after you wash it. I considered sending it back but had hopes that washing it would improve it and I was right. It's not as fuzzy as I thought and the silky part isn't as smooth as I hoped but my daughter still seems to like it fine.
B0015R2AWI|4|Decent sized for big babies.
B000WJPCFW|5|We got this as a present when my baby was 3 months old and I put it together right away, out of excitement! I tried putting her in the next day but she was too floppy and she couldn't hold herself up well. Yet, when I pulled her out she cried because she wanted to stay with all the toys! She's now almost 7 months and spends almost an hour in it every day! She loves all the toys, especially the animal sounds which she tries to imitate and she loves eating the dragon's tounge. I think the color attracts her.
B003OBYTN6|4|The second seat is why I purchased this stroller to begin with. It is easy to installand you can fold the stroller without removing the seat. My 2 year old loves riding in it and says it's comfortable. I also like how it has it's own visor.  The only drawbacks to this seat are minor headaches to me. The first is that the weight limit is 35lbs so my 2 yo will be too big soon and the baby is too small to ride there yet and the other is getting the child in and out of the seat.  I have to lower the seat all the way and slide her out when the infant carrier is up top.
B0031QPNES|5|Good price, good product. No problems so far. I love the color and its comfortable. Would buy again for a friend or in the future.
B0038JDD36|5|nice and soft....
B004GEC8LU|5|I purchased this to replace an older toddler seat that my son outgrew so we could have a seat for our second car without having to constantly play the latching game shuttling the unit between cars.  I chose this model as I was looking for an economical model though I did not want to sacrifice security. Based on the good reviews, I purchased it and have been very happy with it.  The latches keep the unit secured well to the car and the belt loop keeps the seat belt in place as expected. Detachment of the back is fairly easy, and I've done it a few times to take the booster on trips.
B00F217VQI|5|very good
B000PKMVBQ|5|These really are the best bibs out there. The hard clunky ones just got in the way. These Bumkins held up to many washings and were best tolerated by my twins - they aren't as restrictive yet they do cover a large area and kept them very clean and dry. These bibs are the way to go.
B000G0KQWQ|5|This was such an incredibly important baby item for us. My son would only sleep while being held AND in motion for the first two months of his life.  Whether it was colic or his temperament, we'll never know.  But it was a tough time for us.  Finally, a combination of the Miracle Blanket, the [[ASIN:B002TUTOOC Graco Lovin' Hug Swing, Barcelona Bluegrass]], and a close reading of [[ASIN:0553381466 The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer]] allowed us to get a little sleep. Swaddling my son in the Miracle Blanket sometimes provided the only way to get our son to stop crying -- and it was wonderful to have a soothing tool that both my husband and I had equal success with.  We never really swaddled his legs -- just his arms.  This blanket was in every way superior to receiving blankets and less-expensive swaddlers, at least in terms of soothing power for my son.    My son benefited from the Miracle Blanket until he was 10 months old!  He now sleeps like a champ.  But for eight solid months, he spent almost all his sleeping hours swaddled in the Miracle Blanket.  The blanket is definitely showing some wear, but it is in no way compromised by all the hard use.  It's still perfectly good.  I have friends who say it's essential to have more than one, but at $30 a blanket, we were fine with just one.      For those parents with children who are able to get out of the blanket, I have a few recommendations (other than just swaddling tightly).  One big help to us was tucking my son's hands in the foot pouch.  It didn't change his position at all, but definitely made it harder for him to get his hands out as he got older.  And when my son got really big and was strong enough to wiggle out (maybe at 8 months old), we swaddled his arms in the Miracle Blanket then zipped a [[ASIN:B0030CFZUK The Original Woombie Cocoon Swaddle (Preemie (3-6 lbs), Avocado)]] (Mega Baby size!) on top.  This helped him stay in the Miracle Blanket a bit longer each night, but mainly served the purpose of preventing the Miracle Blanket from sliding up to his shoulders and neck when he got out.  We \\"weaned\\" my son from swaddling (when he was ready and clearly didn't need it anymore) by gradually loosening the tightness of the Miracle Blanket, but still zipping the Woobie around him -- I felt he was safer this way, though I have friends who did not think this measure was necessary.  My son is now done with all of it!  He sleeps independently and unswaddled, with little fanfare when we finally stopped.  So I have no worries that this created any bad habits or dependencies for him.    The Miracle Blanket was an essential item for us for the better part of my son's life so far.  My only regret is that we didn't use it sooner.  We received it as a gift before my son was born, but my husband and I weren't sure about \\"straightjacketing\\" the baby and didn't really do much with it until my son was about 6 weeks old.  Even then, we didn't want to use it during all sleep time.  Now, though, I look back and recognize that my son's sleeping improved the more we used the Miracle Blanket.  His night sleeping improved when we started using it at bedtime, and his daytime naps got longer and more consolidated when we started using it for naps.  If we're fortunate enough to have another baby, we will probably use a Miracle Blanket right from the beginning!  I wholeheartedly recommend this, and am so thankful to the experienced parents who got this for us as a baby gift.      One more recommendation: A [[ASIN:B002QMSVQ0 Wubbanub Infant Pacifier - Lion with satin mane]].  You can tuck the animal in the Miracle Blanket to hold the pacifier within reach.  We did this for months.  Awesome!    I wish all the best to every new parent out there... and to every new parent of a fussy and/or colicky baby.  :o)
B000YDDF6O|5|Lots of music, really cool.
B00020L78M|4|With two babies learning to crawl and going every which way, I needed a solution, pronto! The Superyard XT was a lifesaver. Although it's not perfect, we found solutions to make it work for our twins.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Huge area for two babies plus an adult - We have the regular 6-sided superyard with one extension (2 panels), to make it eight sides. The dimensions are 80\\" x 80\\" if you use it as an octagon.<br />* Toy stations can be set up on each corner and toys attached to the sides, including any that would work on a crib. Rotate them frequently to keep your child interested<br />* A [[ASIN:B002BSHTS0 Tiny Love Classic Mobile]] works great with the Superyard as it's huge, safe to use until they are standing.<br />* It's big enough to give freedom to your child but small enough to fit in your home.<br />* 35\\" wide x 26\\" inch high panels are easy for an adult to step over. I wouldn't recommend it for a pregnant mom however.<br />* Easy to clean - can be use indoors or outdoors<br />* Adaptable panels are great for childproofing - we've used panels to keep kids away from windows and from large TVs, wedging ends between heavy furniture and securing them firmly.<br />* Extremely durable - we've had this for three years, used it for many playgroups, and several families have borrowed and used it. It still looks new.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It would be ideal if it had a child-proof gate - the sides are very hard to open and the playard becomes very unsteady once you do this.<br />* Your child will be able to slide it around if it's not secured. We bought inexpensive interlockable foam pads from BJs, placed the superyard over them, marked along the inside and cut them to size. It won't budge like this. For ease in reassembling later, mark the tiles from left to right and from top to bottom in order as it will be like a jigsaw if you take the tiles apart.<br />* To keep your child from pulling the foam tiles apart, place a large quilt over the foam mat, tuck the ends under and you're set to go. Amazon sells many inexpensive microsuede machine washable ones - make sure is more than 80\\" wide.<br />* Toddlers may be able to climb out if they're barefoot or wearing socks. Putting shoes on them solves the problem.<br />* This is hardly portable, no matter what it says. Once set up, it's there to stay. With eight sides, it's on the heavy side.<br /><br />Look under product images or my profile, I have lots of pictures posted of how you can adapt the Superyard, cut the foam tiles, make lots of play stations inside it and turn your living room into your very own preschool. Just kidding, sort of.microsuede machine washable ones - make sure is more than 80\\" wide.  * Toddlers may be able to climb out if they're barefoot or wearing socks.

B00KH0IIQQ|5|Best
B000JLIXJ0|5|It keeps baby warm without having to cloth him in thick clothes. Very convenient when it comes to having to put baby in the carrier.
B00849L490|1|I've tested this item several times and have not been able to successfully keep anything warm for more that an hour.  This was a complete waste of money.
B001S4EPEE|3|I ordered this mini fridge so I wouldnt have to go up and down stairs in the middle of the night while feeding my newborn. I was a little disappointing with the size. It works for the intended purpose but I would have liked  it to be a little bigger. I wanted it to fit a whole 32 oz formula bottle. Its close but not quite.
B0011URFRE|3|After reading all the reviews and doing some research on safety, I can honestly say I was hoping for more.  The seat does appear to be safe, it was easy to install and fits nicely in our Jeep Cherokee.  The negative is that it is not comfortable or easy for my child to use as our Britax.  My son, age 5, is small for his age and still likes to sleep in the car [we travel quite a bit] - I find that the seat does not work for him as I had hoped.  We would all agree that safety come first - we do travel and spend quite a bit of time in our car, so comfort does play into it secondly.  I don't think that I would buy it again - I would choose the Britax seat instead - that is just what I think would be best for our family.  If you are used to the Britax seat - I would just stay with that. [But than we hear that safety on the larger Britax seats are under fire] - OH to be a parent:)
B002CRIQSW|5|I didn't want to spend a fortune on a fancy brand-name crib or huge sleigh-style monstrosity and so gambled on the Graco Sarah (in white) after reading good reviews here and in the Baby Bargains book.  We have been using this for 5 months now with a firm Colgate Classica II mattress and are very happy with it.  The wood is smooth and the crib appears to be quite solid.  I have since bought a second one (espresso color) for a vacation home as I didn't want to risk buying a second hand crib and mattress.  It is now being tested a bit more as my daughter is moving around and kicking at the sides and putting her legs (in a sleep sack) through the rails. I'll update my review if it ever starts failing. I would highly recommend this crib.
B000JVEBEQ|5|I always wondered why people stared at me, turns out they were staring at my chest. I have always had very prominent nipples and would try to cover them up by crossing my arms or loose clothing. These VERY reusable nipple covers are GREAT! The only improvement in the order would have been \\"for best results\\" suggestions.
B006QRFE1G|3|Bought these because I didn't know that bum genius made infant diapers. I have this brand and the bum genius. The bum genius is a much softer diaper which I prefer to use on our newborn. These diapers just sit unused in the drawer.
B000MRK5MO|4|I used these bottles for both my kids. They are easy to clean and seem very durable. These bottles survived frequent drops and many cycles through the dishwasher. Other than the slight discoloration, the bottles are still as good as new.
B0002JZOLO|5|With two new grandsons, it is most convenient to have my own base and I also made sure both parents of both babies had a base in their car so we never have to worry about leaving the base with the baby, or going to leave with the baby only to find out the base is in the other car.  I think all baby seats should come with TWO bases.
B00OJOB6UQ|5|Very sturdy. Just as pictured. My kid loves it!!
B00KTTMKGY|1|I was sadly disappointed when my 1 month old foot print didn't fit in the frame. It was smaller than I expected.
B00083HK0M|5|Got this instead of a fancy diaper genie. So glad we did. Works great and takes normal garbage bags.
B00648KZDY|5|soft  and light
B0030DFSWO|1|I purchased these refills hoping to keep down the odor from the diaper champ. I had been using regular trash bags and thought the actual refills would be better, because according to their description, they control odor. these are not any better than using a trash bag, if not worse!! dont waste your money, they do not eliminate or even cut down on the odor from the diaper champ!!!
B001OC5UMQ|4|I purchased this to keep my medium sized, fairly easy going dog out of the next room.  Item is as described and works well for our situation, but is a little flimsy.  I don't see it working well for keeping larger, more determined dogs contained or children either....some can be pretty crafty.  I purchased an already opened box so the price was terrific and all parts and instructions were included.  Only trouble was I paid extra for next day shipping and received it in two days.  I did get reimbursed for shipping, though.
B000LSL5ZK|5|By far our favorite baby spoons. They are fun and the perfect size.
B006YNM3VQ|2|color is brown not cream as in picture and is very small so in a month baby doesn't fit any more
B00009VE5O|5|its very good its warm for the winter i just put one blanket inside and ready to go.  i like this product
B0012IYFO6|1|I bought this monitor for three reasons    1) The claimed 650' reception capability  2) The claimed non-interference with wireless networks  3) Security (not seeing someone else's kid on the same channel).    I can't verify point 3, but the product wholly failed on the first two counts. I live on the second floor of an apartment building, so I had hoped that I could use the monitor to get the mail in the lobby while my child is sleeping. Unfortunately, the reception cut off about 10' outside my doorway. I tried repositioning the camera but could not improve upon the results. While the product worked everywhere within my apartment, it did not function far beyond the door and did not work at all when on another floor. To get less than 30' of reception from the product is simply unacceptable when it claims 650'.    The device also takes down wireless internet networks whenever it is functioning. Even if you are willing to live with the problem, there's a good bet that your neighbor's wireless network is also being affected. Hence, I could not in good conscience continue using this product even if I was willing to tolerate this disability.    A few other minor issues--    The handheld unit is not well designed to stay upright--it topples over too easily.     Also, although the unit is clearer than analog devices, it also emits a hiss even when the room is completely silent.     The so-called zoom function is merely a software trick--the image is doubled in size but half as clear.    The only great aspect of the product is the night vision. Even in near-total darkness, the image is fairly good. But this singular positive side does not even begin to make up for its numerous flaws.
B005VMJOBS|3|I loved the style and color of these rags and even though they were pricey, decided to splurge with some gift credit. They are awesome when you first get them but beware, after ONE wash the colors fade dramatically. After the second wash they are completely faded out. The color material must be a very cheap fabric. A bummer because they are cute and a good size.
B00073HJG8|3|The net was easy to install, but my daughter has A LOT of stuffed animals and it has to hang pretty low in order to hold them, if the netting was a wider to have a deeper pocket so to speak it would be of better use.
B00M9ZQZ3A|5|My daughter absolutely loves all of her Nuby bath toys!  And I LOVE that the Sea Scooper keeps them all in one place and allows the water to drain off!
B003BL1HIE|5|I love these! They can fast too! Way cheaper than buying them at the store.
B0080HPXL6|5|Great booster...love the pattern, super safe and easy to use.  I have used Britax seats for years...now that my kiddos are older...I buy the Britax boosters for them.
B000056JND|4|These bottles are the perfect size and work great with the Avent Isis breast pump. I never had a problem with them leaking at all. You can freeze with them too. The 4 oz. size is perfect for the breastfeeding mother. The milk doesn't come out fast at all. Great bottles.
B000AV5LZ8|3|Seat is cushy, but the step part is wobbly. It really needs two steps to secure it and so the toddler can get up and down it by herself.
B000GKWA66|5|I got this for my friend that just had a baby. She loves it and put it in the babys crib. She thanked me and said it was a big help. I'm glad because a lot of the sleep aids are not that great.
B00AO084CW|5|Excellent
B00A4B35I4|5|My son slept in this from the day we brought him home from the hospital, until he was about 5 months old when he moved into his crib permanently.  He slept great. He was sleeping through the night by 4 months. It was easy to transport around the house or travel with so he felt comfortable.  It is easy to rock and very nice with the additional \\"deluxe\\" pillow features.  If you worry about baby getting a flat head from sleeping on his back too much just make sure to do tummy time.  You can always buy a \\"noggin nest\\" pillow.  Either way my son's head was fine and I would recommend this to everyone with a new baby.
B0088N4CSC|5|Perfect little backpack for my preschooler. We also love taking it to Nana's house or Sunday School. It is probably not big enough for a grade schooler, I don't think a folder would fit inside.
B000056J8N|5|A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers.  I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold, and fortunately, received these.  They are large - 27&quot;x 27&quot; square and are essential for baby care.  I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old.  I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day.  They work great as burp cloths, and are superb for wiping up other food messes.  Additionally, I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months.  Extremely durable, fold-up rather small for travel, and launder well.  101 uses, I love them!
B006OJIYFE|5|This gate protects the grandchildren and still looks good with the fireplace.<br />It was easy to put up, and get into to clean the pellet stove.
B005ZBHXOA|4|Purchased for our 4 year grandson to use when he's at our home. It's comfortable for him to set in and the height is good. The surface is very easy to clean. We are using in on a wooden dinning room chair and it seemed to slide around if he had any movement. Purchased a pad to put between the chair and the booster seat which help to keep it in place.
B000P9TK0W|5|I have the Medela in style but had to travel for a quick trip and already had a lot of bags and wasn't certain, I'd have access to somewhere private to pump with an electrical socket. I bought this and while it is much more effort than I'm used to (electric vs manual), it worked well! Suction was just right. It's a great back up for me, for random reasons when my electric won't do!
B003NSAY7U|3|Safety latches can easily be defeated by a two-year old.  Plastic compound is very soft & can be opened by infant.
B00AASF8EU|5|Although I'm still feeling a bit guilty for spending so much for a long piece of cloth, I love the convenience that this product has given me as an alternative to toting around an infant seat carrier and pushing a stroller - sometimes it's just not worth setting those things up. I've had mine for less than a month and so far I've only mastered one &#34;tie&#34;. By the way, they also sell coordinated head wraps!
B003ZC8B1K|5|The beco is unique when compared to other carriers because not only is it more ergonomically correct for the baby's posture (making the experience much more enjoyable for them) it also is for the parents.  My back really hurt in the Bjorn but not at all with this carrier.  Also, as opposed to all other carriers out there, you can have the baby face frontwards so to see everything, backwards to face you, on your side or even on your back.  The options really are wonderful and make this a great product.
B00AWAWMHC|4|My one year old granddaughter was terrified of this Barney doll when she first saw it.  I thinks it's cuz the singing voice doesn't sound like he does on his movies.  So we're careful not to push his tummy and when he's not singing, she loves him!!
B00095LILQ|5|If you are an active parent who takes his/her kid out on nice days, this is a convenient add on to hold water bottles, keys and cell phone.  It fastens securely, is easy to install, and puts everything you need right up by your hands.  I recommend it for anyone who purchases a BOB.
B00E5LYF8S|5|Looks nice, roomy, live the material, enough pockets inside and outside. Love the fact that it can be attached on the stroller 's handle. Fits great on a Bugaboo Cameleon.
B005KL32NQ|5|I could not find this product in the stores.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  It seems to be doing the job it was meant to do.
B0028BPRK2|5|This works perfect!  I love how big it is and shades the baby from the side and from the top.  It was well worth the m oney!
B0097OAUT6|5|good quality
B001OC5UNA|1|These gates are super annoying. I bought two, thinking they'd be the best there is considering the price. WRONG. They are a pain to put up, always slip and even when they are secured, the door is very narrow and annoying to operate. I'm not a big person, but I have trouble getting through the narrow passageway if I happen to be carrying anything - you know, like the baby.
B001190D5Q|5|The smell and consistency of this is much better then other brands.  Use it every night and my child has yet to get diaper rash, she is 2 months old.
B00QYYIF5I|4|I love it! It works for both my toddler and my newborn!
B009QEP1QO|2|Looked to buy some knee protection for my 2 and a half son as he keeps falling and skinning his knees. These pads didn't fit him comfortably (one of the straps is not long enough, I forgot which one, top or bottom). Other than that they look nicely made
B000O8UGUM|2|Bought these among several other lines and still aren't what we're looking for. Not thick enough. Poor quality in my opinion.
B003B90UKM|1|I would like to start by saying that I never write reviews---as a working Mom, I simply don't have the time. However, the safety issue with this product is just too important not to share with customers. I have been using these to store my own baby food for the past 3 months and at first, I loved them. However, after only 3 months of use, the inside rims of the glass have CHIPPED! This is of course extremely unsafe for baby and I have thrown them out. It is unfortunate because it is a very convenient product, but with this type of issue, they should really be recalled.
B00AO084BI|3|We had a different Graco swing/bouncer combo for our first son and decided to try this one since we hated the non-removable tray on our old one. It showed up yesterday and already I have to say I would probably not buy this one again, either.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />Love the vibration option on the bouncer<br />Bouncer is fairly easy to remove<br />The recline is great for itty bitty newborns (our twins were quite small and are now barely 6 lbs, so if you have a baby at or just above the 5.5 lb minimum recommended weight this swing is a good choice.)<br /><br />The not so good:<br /><br />The recline adjust handle is at the rear of the seat, which is a pain to get to<br />The straps and strap cover are a pain in the neck, especially when holding a screaming newborn and trying to undo it one handed<br />The frame feels quite flimsy despite it's size<br />The fabric and straps are super cheap feeling<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned the Fisher Price Zen Collection swing as a better option, and I have to agree. We are actually borrowing our friend's FP Zen and used it for a week before purchasing our Graco, and except for the recline (it does not go as far back and the babies seem to slide down more, which I don't like) and the lack of vibration in the seat the FP is a superior product overall. I was shocked at how much sturdier it is and how much nicer the materials are compared to the Graco DuetConnect LX. If we decide we need a second monster swing/bouncer combo for baby #2 (who could not care less about a swing at this point) we will be getting the FP instead of another Graco.
B005PK1G76|3|not so great for my stroller. everytime i fold it, everything falls out. when in reg mode, its not easy to access because of the bumper bar.  probably perfect for an umbrella stroller but not for my babyhome emotion.
B0014WHCUE|5|This is a great product.  They are soft and do the job well.  Since they are removable they are easy to wash.
B006Z2BZBU|5|This mattress is perfect! It's just what I was looking for and the reviews where very helpful. It fits perfect in my daughters pack n play and will be perfect for when she has to sleep in it.
B009X4C5OI|5|Fits perfectly in our mazda 3 hatch. The inly car seat that is reliably easy to install AND uninstall. Comfy and seat is washable.
B001DVRTEA|5|I love these things! They are great for securing toys to the high chairs when we are out at restaurants. I even ordered a few extra to have in the diaper bag.<br /><br />I saw bad reviews for this product because the snaps are not the right size to hold bottles but come on people.. it is secure-a-toy, not secure-a-bottle.  I even put it around the Sophie giraffe neck (another complaint) and it holds it OK enough. A child with advanced dexterity could get the giraffe out, but it is OK for now. It does work best with toys that have something to snap around but again, come on people..<br /><br />I'd definitely put these on my go-to list for baby shower gifts.
B0001UD17S|1|I Received this item over two weeks ago and there were numerous things wrong. I immediately called target and explained the situation, they reffered me to simplicity's customer servive.  I have spoke to simplicity three times and was promised each time that the 3 drawers would be replaced and sent ASAP! After not receiving the 1st time, I called and was told they need the model number, I think they should have known that already. I gave them the Model number and was promised it would be shipped over night. 6 days later ( today) I called back to find out what was going on and was told every thing is on back order and they should have it in within 3 weeks. I was told they will call me when it arrives. I am expecting the kid in 1 week but still I have no functionin changing table, lets see how target wll respond? Target has refunded me 20% and offered to replace the item with another item, since I have the matching dresser there is not a similiar combo unit, so we may end up with something that does not match.
B001387H40|2|These would be lovely pads -- nice and thick, soft, soft waterproof backing -- but after the first wash one of the two pads is already falling apart.  The hem is coming undone all the way around, and 3 of the 4 corners are completely undone.  Very disappointing.
B00TB6FZ90|5|I love this bag! It's exactly what I was looking for. Bought it for my 3 year old to take to preschool. Wanted to get him a backpack but he doesn't need to take anything to school except his lunch so this is perfect.  Not only is it super cute but it's insulated to keep food fresh and can be carried or worn as a backpack, hand bag, or shoulder bag. Great for little kids.
B0034JHDHM|5|I wish I had this for my first LO. Gently removes cradle cap and massages scalp well. It was easier on my second child as I was quicker to react and expereinced on cradle cap that this made it a breeze. Took a few uses to rid it everytime my LO got dry. I did not need to use oil or other stuff to help remove the scales which is a plus since less is safer. It feels gentlier to use than the hospital sponge/brush. Just be sure to use the comb to a minimal and at an angle.
B00EMK7F1G|5|Love it got my niece
B002VUCB6S|5|I love this car seat so easy to use not so complicated only my husband took time to put it in our jeep in the rear facing postition as the car seat belt would go through a tight place in the seat , it sits great in our car not taking big space as this was one of my fears , the color is great suits boys , my baby sits confortable and safe and he likes to look from the window unlike his old infant car seat !! i had no issues with unlocking the strapes with one push unlike other reviews .. would recommend it the only thing i dislike is that when my baby falls asleep his head will not stay in place i have to support it but i was told this happens with all car seats.
B0016A7QYQ|5|Bought this and the following three items for a friend who gave birth to triplets.  She couldn't stop thanking me and I couldn't of done it without you amazon.  The quantity, quality, price and free shipping made this a joy and a pleasure for everyone.
B004GCJMLG|5|I bought this product based on the one and only review with 5 stars from another parent looking for the best child proofing devices for the house.  I am very pleased with the results. This is a solidly built product that is fairly easy to install.  The package comes with a template for each lock that allows you to line up the holes without having to use a measuring tape.  This saves a lot of time. The best thing about this lock is that it keeps the cupboard doors shut very tight. This eliminates the possibility for children to pinch their fingers or reach into the opening that you would normally get with a latch type lock system.  Also, since the lock requires a special key to unlock, there's no concern that children will understand how the lock system works to unlock it by themselves.    I even installed this on our Lazy Susan cupboard with no problem.    The instructions for the template suggests that you mark the holes with a pencil and then drill.  To save some time, you can just drill through the template holes right away and then screw in the lock.    Since you get a template for each lock that comes in the package there's no worry that you'll ruin the template for the next lock.  The first lock took a little time to install, but after that I was able to install locks on the cupboard doors in under 10 minutes per lock.
B00J7C4UEO|4|Everything about this stroller is great except the front wheels. They do not maneuver or turn on flooring or carpet and the stroller is impossible to steer w one hand!  We bought one (on vacation) and returned it thinking it was a lemon, nope! The next one was the same. :(
B0050GD2E0|5|My niece bought the stroller and I added the cup. She liked it.<br />She will make good use of it,
B002SW3C7G|5|Thick and soft, and attractive.
B00I3WEXPU|5|These bottles work great and they clean well. Best of all, this bottle releases milk as the baby puts pressure on it, just like a breast. That makes it easier for a baby to drink. Best of all, these have slow flow nipples which I needed through my entire time bottle feeding since I chugged too quickly. 30 something years ago these were not available and I used to choke myself. These bottles keep that from happening. They are great and make a wonderful gift. Recommended!
B007SI0DNQ|1|Junk. Very thin!!! Sorry I bought it!!!!!
B000E9TDRS|4|Baby didn't really fit, too loose. But otherwise great product.
B00A7PPTLI|5|What a great idea for a door stopper to prevent little fingers from getting pinched or smashed when they close doors.
B0018LYOZM|5|my granddaughter loves this chair - nice and soft and she climbs all over it  - nice size for now but she might outgrow this
B009TCEEUW|2|Very rough feeling, low thread count, sandpaperish!
B002WDEIVA|1|I bought this because it stated it was water resistant..... I just found out it is NOT.  It's regular cloth and the poop leaked through the decorative cover and through this &#34;water resistant cover&#34;.<br />It can be used as a cover, but don't expect it to protect the Bobby.
B001V24IAY|5|I found the whole experience wonderful.  It was sent to me quickly.  the frog is adorable and my granddaughter loves it.  It is just the right size for her to carry around and cuddle.
B000V9IB0G|4|Maybe its just me but I foudn this a little too firm... wish it was a tad bit more cushiony! Maybe I feel this way because I use it for my infant and is possibly perfect for those using it for yoga/ workouts..
B001V9EVCM|3|The bottles seem great but if it falls off a counter onto the floor it can shatter. This happened to us just this evening. I do wish they were made from a less fragile plastic.
B002VUCBBS|3|The carseat itself is nice, but the straps keep getting twisted up! And the spare part of the strap is in the front of the seat so my son can mess and pull at it (not safe).
B00HAZUJLI|4|It looks wonderful and was easy to put together.  Can't wait to &#34;test drive it&#34; when the baby arrives.
B002FKU6MK|1|My baby does not like it and also I found that the &#34;berry&#34; is too big for his little month. He is 5 months and I was afraid he would choke on it. Too bad I can't return it.
B000LP2G6K|5|I ordered this product because I have 1 new grandchild and 1 on the way.  I needed a bed for them when they come to grandmas house, this met my needs perfectly...
B009YDCMJ6|5|Very Cute
B00ECKPV5S|5|Good price .<br />Ultra plush... Soooo soft!!!
B006P05SHO|2|The suction cups do not stick to slightly uneven or unsmooth tile. If you have any texture in your tile, this may not be a good solution for you. I've had to hang mine on the inside of my bathtub since it won't hang from the tile wall.
B005DE9IYC|4|I like the product, video good quality and excellent produt, easy to use, esasy set up. I will recomend this product.
B000YDDF6O|5|I know my Grandson will love this.  It was already loaded with batteries so I did not have to worry about that
B001O9F6M8|5|Our daughter was born with a perfect, round little head but it wasn't long before she the whole back of it was flat.  Being somewhat concerned about having to wear a helmet or something down the line at about 3 months we bought this pillow.  We used it in the crib and on the floor during play times and after just a few weeks to a month of use her head was back to being nice and round. Now, as a 1 year old you'd never know the entire back of her head was once completely flat.  Yay for a quick, comfortable, simple and easy fix to a common baby problem!  Definitely recommend trying.
B00E60MTF4|4|My 6 year old was really excited when I found this high backed belt positioning booster seat.  He's above average in height and weight, and finding a high back car seat like this that still fits him is a challenge.  It's easy to put together and into the car, very adjustable, and it's comfortable.  The only down side I've found is that it feels very cheaply made.  Perhaps some will find this to be a plus since it's lightweight, but it left me feeling a bit uneasy.  The cup holder is also incredibly cheap, and the soft plastic ring comes detached every time he picks up his drink.
B0010LR812|5|I had tried EVERY kind of toothbrush I could think of in an effert to get my son to actually brush his teeth.  When I did it he SCREAMED (and no I wasn't brushing hard!!!)  He just hated the whole process.. even though he loved the toothpaste!  With this brush he will brush for a good 20 minutes while he watches his nighttime cartoon!!  So thankful for this brush.. I hated making him cry :(
B005OUISUU|5|Baby loves them!!! In & out of the tub- good suction too.
B00AO084CW|5|My 5 week old loves this swing. The only downside is how loud the vibration on the bouncer is.
B004HFQOLI|5|Great price and delivery for this set.  I love these bottles because they have the wider opening makes it easier to prepare bottles with powder formula.
B005XJ2VGE|5|Great seating system...i have used it for bottle feeding as well as table feeding. This was very easy to put together. I also like the fact that it glides on wheels so i can move it from my dining room to kitchen easily. The separate booster seat is a plus when you have more than one small child.
B0058K5IIQ|5|My 4 month old daughter loves to roll around and play in this mat. It was the best thing I purchased for her considering our house is all tile. It's gives her the space and cushion to move and develop her little muscles without getting hurt. Great buy.
B003JHYDIQ|5|Perfect! Def will buy next size!
B001086046|5|My daughter wore this outfit for her first Christmas and looked adorable!!  The material is super soft and the red against the black is so vibrant!
B004A8AQC0|5|These are very cute, high quality tights and fit well.  I would recommend to anyone.  They shipped in plenty of time too.
B00G4P11QM|5|this is a GREAT gate.  It seems much more high end in construction than basic gates.  I think it's worth the money.  It looks nice,works great, and was relatively simple to install by myself (despite not very good instructions)
B0012LZD5I|5|These are really cute, soft and sturdy. Great price and fast shipping!
B00913DY3W|5|This is the only teether my kiddo loves! Easy to hold, easy to fit into her mouth, easy to clean, no worry about chemicals. Can't recommend it enough.
B002NV0VLW|5|My wife was having back trouble and her arms were getting tired from pumping before we got this. Much better now. It's comfortable and conenient.
B000F76WS2|4|Although you will need to spend at least 2 hours putting this together, it is a great deal for the money. Have not had any problems with durability.
B00KPZI5XE|5|great
B00BLY1L7A|5|Fit perfectly and gave the baby a much more comfortable bed now that he's a year old and weighs more. We used it to replace the much thinner mattress that came with the crib.
B003AP72K8|5|I purchased 2 of these aprons for my sons.  It fits my 4 year old perfectly with a room to grow.  The robot print is to die for!  I love the magnetic neck closure both for ease of use and safety reasons.  They were bought with the idea of keeping the boys clean while helping in the kitchen, but I can see these being used for painting and lots of other craft projects.  Adorable!
B00AKKDSNG|5|Super easy & baby sleeps great in it.  Love snuggling through the side door.
B00KDKKD1I|5|The quality of this pillow is fantastic.  As of yet, I haven't introduced it to my daughter, since she is only 22 months old and I'm just waiting for the right time to introduce it to her.  She does enjoy laying down on it every so often when she's hanging around the house.  I haven't tried out the amount of fluff yet for her, but it seems like it will be just fine.  The reason I purchased this pillow over others is because I had read about the excellent customer service.  Once I received my pillow, I received an email from the owner asking me if I liked my purchase.  I told the owner that the pillow seemed fantastic, but I hadn't had my daughter try out the fluff in it yet.  He responded that even if I introduce it to my daughter at a later time and it was too fluffy, to let him know later on.  The reason that I bought this pillow was for the excellent customer service and it didn't disappoint.  I can even contact the owner weeks after opening the pillow and suggest less fluff, if needed.  I thought this was fantastic!!   Update:  At 26 months, my daughter loves it!  Very happy!!
B00AS0F8H2|5|I have tried other labels like this and these are by far the best on the market. The price is reasonable and my shipment was fast. I recently ordered some for baby gifts as well. I highly recommend this seller.
B002WB2P1M|4|We decided to buy this chair because of the good price and it can convert to booster with removable back.But when I put it on my car,I found there's nothing I can fix it on the seat like normally booster dose(at least has 2 hooks on the back).Since the seat belt has to cross whole chair,I think it won't have safety concern.otherwise, the design are good,the fabric is comfortable,won't feel too hot in this crazy TX summer.
B007HKOL92|1|The batch we received are terrible. 1/2 of the nipples came with what appears to be holes, but can't suck any water through them. The other 1/2 have tiny holes and kids get frustrated and quit eating. We came from the 3-6 month variable flow nipples. These are rated for 6 month + and I would say the label is backwards at best.
B00PHQ1LIC|5|I looked all around for a nasal aspirater comparable to the one at the hospital that got left after we delivered our baby. I bought three that were worthless - no suction and cheaply made. This one had good reviews on Amazon so I gave it a chance.  So far, I'm glad I did! The product is a little larger than most but it gets the job done and successfully has gotten out the junk in my little man's nose that we've been fighting since birth (he's 4 weeks) it's also nice that you can wash it with ease!  Would highly recommend!
B000X4WORU|2|Didn't work well for my daughter. Not enough support for mom or baby.
B00BO1QUNK|5|Refills were exactly what I needed. Prompt service to order. In fact, may order another one to keep on hand. Two grandbabies and the oldest likes to bite on the tips. :)
B004DS14B4|5|I have most brands of reusable squeezies. This one is my favorite for two reasons: 1. it is the most easy to clean. The wide mouth and soft silicone make it really easy to turn inside out. 2. There is almost NO leftover food when baby gets done. some of the others have tops that make it hard for baby to suck out all of the food and you get 2-3 tablespoons of food left in there. But the Beaba compresses way better. I love this thing. I'll add a bonus reason why I love the Beaba and that is the excellent customer service provided by the company.
B0011URFRE|4|I only gave a 4 star review bc this seat isnt meant to face rear and forward like I thought. When I searched rear and forward facing seats this one was the first to come up but the only one out of the list that was only meant to face forward unlike the others that face both ways. My son is almost 10 months and weighs 21 pounds so hes just about outgrown his infant carseat and I wanted to get him something that he could use facing rear but turn around once he turned 1. So if you have a child who is 1 and weighs over 20 pounds and can face forward this carseat would be the one to get!! Its very very sturdy and comfortable. I thought of sending it back to get a rear/forward facing one but I think im just going to keep it so my son can use it once hes 1 bc I like it so much. He seems and looks very comfy in this seat and the cup holder is a great feature! One other thing that I only gave it a 4 star for was because the piece that does go bw their legs does go up pretty far but it didnt seem to bother my son while he sat in it. I really liked how you adjust the straps in this seat by the push of a button! So overall I think once my son can finally ride forward we both will love this seat!!
B008K02VGI|5|We needed a mobile for our son's crib at daycare.<br />This one has a bunch of great reviews so we decided to go with it.<br />The mobile works perfectly and I would recommend to anyone looking for a versatile mobile!
B004OBZG00|4|I ordered this so I didn't have to have the waste & expense of ziplock bags & the inconvenience of plastic sandwich containers that have to be washed after each use & don't last long.  This is well made, sturdy & easy to clean.  Plus, it looks cute & my daughters like it so I ordered more.
B001CWVYMI|2|Fits car seat and a little extra but weak material...tore on first trip...needs wheels
B00QGFJW9I|5|I used for my door and it's easy to stick and peel..Also they came with example how to put them. I love them.
B002WB2GAM|5|THIS is a great quality stroller I purchased this about a month ago for my 3 month old grand daughter and her mommy , she is a very big baby so I figured we needed somethhing sturdy,boy does this fit the bill I am so happy with my purchase I actually  just ordered one for myself the padded seat and canopy are wonderful a,it stears with one hand and a very smooth ride. I love it.
B00000IZQI|5|To be honest, when they first came I thought they weren't as nice as advertised but I quickly changed my opinion. My 7 month old loves these best of all. He loves to knock them over after I endlessly stack them and he enjoys playing with the wheels. It is one of the first toys he heads for in his playroom and I always take them on errands to entertain him. They embellished the description a bit but they didn't need to, it is a good sturdy likable toy and a great value for the price. The siren listed is just a piece of plastic that spins (no sound) and the flip top on the top of the one car is really not exciting or easy for a child to play with, I have trouble getting my fingers in to bother with it. But, as I said it is just a good toy and doesn't need bells and whistles or the overstated description to be a great toy. I would suggest these cars to anyone as a great purchase!
B00E5U6L04|5|Just as shown in photos Looked Great Quality well worth the price most importantly it went on Our Granddaughter's Bed and She Loves it
B001NPD72E|4|We're very happy with this car seat. We have the Boulevard in our other car and the only item I miss is the velcro strips that keep the straps back when I put her in the seat. Others have suggested looping them behind the arm rests, that works but this requires one to be fairly precise while holding a 30lb. toddler. Otherwise, I'm very happy with it. It was easy to install, it's a little easier to put her in since I don't have to lift her as high and my daughter seems to like it.
B00433OQO6|5|Love these bottles!! My son wound not take any other bottle out there, but he loves this one! Great price for 5, and came very fast!
B0019ROM5C|5|I LOVE this product!!!  I could have my son right next to my bed - no going into a nursery to check on him.  When he started to stir, I could usually reach out and rock him right back to sleep without getting up.  I wish I'd had this for my first child!!!
B008N6WGA0|1|I wanted Bugaboo Cameleon fabric but I received Bugaboo Buffalo fabric in Cameleon box. That's why I sent it back and couldn't use it.
B00GUN3Z1W|1|This gate broke on the second day of use.  I was locking it into place in the doorway and the &#34;wooden&#34; slide lock broke in half. Cheap construction and materials. Would NOT buy again.
B00073HJG8|4|This was just what I needed to get all of my kids stuffed toys corraled.  It works perfectly & was easy to put up.
B0019UAN5C|5|My Grandson loves Elmo. ..he wants to take a bath all the time now!
B005CMI3UA|5|Fast shipping and exactly what I expected!!
B000056W6H|5|I purchased these because my daughter uses only Avent bottles. She has been using the size 2 nipples, but they are starting to concave and she was having a hard time sucking anything out. THIS LISTING IS FOR SIZE 3 NIPPLES. They are perfect, they are a little more firmer than the size 2 nipples and they don't cave in when she sucks. Cheaper on here than at Target, Walmart and Babies R Us!
B0002U1SFE|1|our daughter was five months old right around the holidays and was looking like she was ready to do her own thing. we decided to pick out an exersaucer for her. i read all of the reviews, checked them out in the stores and decided this one was the best. i don't really know if these are good for the kids or not, but i figured ten minutes or so in the morning would be o.k.. mom's got to brush her teeth! anyways she seemed to like it at first, but after a few weeks she was already bored of it. i didn't put her in it for a few more weeks to see if she would find interest in it again, but no luck. she had no interest in the toys and would cry until i took her out of it. my daughter is ten months old now and every now and then i try to put her in it, but still the same reaction. she hates it! a bit dissapointing at one hundred dollars. it takes up a lot of space and my husband has stubbed his toe on it one too many times. get a doorway jumper instead!
B0065S6O6A|5|soo cute and very well made, great product and all that I expected it to be.  The monkey these is adorable too.[[ASIN:B0065S6O6A Carter's Diaper Stacker, Monkey Rockstar]]
B002DWALTI|4|Worth the money for a 2 month year old
B003ZZQ4S4|5|I found this after we found out we were having a boy, and I thought it would be nice to have some blue things for him (since we went overboard on the pink the first time around!). This blanket is very cute, soft and warm.
B000XT30G4|5|These gates are really great.  I've had them about a year now, but they are perfect for the house.  They look really good and I get compliments on the &#34;iron&#34; doors.  They're easy to use.  They haven't fallen down even once, and that was my big fear, that they would fall on the little dogs and hurt them because they are heavy.  I just love the two I bought and I don't know what I'd do without them.
B0085CBA90|3|I wanted to love these, but they didn't end up being that useful to me after finding a smaller shield that worked well.  It is nice to have a set of sizes that you can try when things are tough - but not totally necessary.
B000XPWXK2|5|These are great! Note that you can put them in the washer AND dryer. So perfect for us!
B00FDMRMS8|5|Best formula dispenser I have purchased!! 3 compartments with their own lids. And pouring into the bottle is so easy with this spout!! I have tried many other products in the past with my other kids, and this is definitely the best!
B00003TL7P|4|I love the convenience of not having to buy special bags.  I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great.  There is no diaper odor in our nursery.  When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!).<br /><br />If you don't clean things, they don't smell clean.  This isn't rocket science.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I don't like the opening mechanism on the front.  But I can't think of any way they could've done it differently that would be as effective.
B004ECJWK4|5|This is awesome. Thanks Door Monkey! I avoided using it for the longest time because I was afraid it would be complicated. But when I stopped looking at the directions and instead just took the thing to my door, I was able to figure exactly what side connected where. It was super easy and it very effective at keeping my son out of our closed and pantry.
B001H0GGXC|4|I have used these bottles for several months with my son.  I love having BPA free materials and they wash up very easily, including in the dishwasher.  (Plastic bottles run through my dishwasher ended up smelling like soap, but not these.)  The sleeves make them more comfortable to hold and I haven't had any bottles break if dropped or bumped.  They are easy to take on and off as long as they are not too cold.  I think the best feature of this design, as compared to other sleeves, is that it allows you to see the ounce markings on the bottle to see how much the baby drank.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that one sleeve developed a tear in the first month and then broke within a week after that.  The rest are all fine so far, after about 3 months of use.
B00ASI748A|4|There are some important features that are a must when it comes to stroller shopping including excellent canopy, good sized and easy to access storage basket, and weight. This stroller scores high marks with good shade (but not excellent) and a nice sized basket, but it's quite heavy, which is fine if you keep it in the garage for strolls. I actually have a lightweight one for the car so if you don't mind getting two strollers, than go for this one. If you do want to keep to one stroller, you will want to consider how small it folds down and how heavy it is to lift in and out of your car. This stroller is both bulky and heavy, but again it is a jogger so those are things you'll just have to accept.<br /><br />If you'd like a full review of the best strollers and what considerations to make when stroller shopping, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com. In the Baby Gear section you'll find a crib shopping guide, what you must have on your registry vs what you really can live without, and the best toys and games for baby stimulation by age range.
B0002DF4EC|1|Warning - this product is only the seat and ropes - it DOES NOT include the frame, even though it doesnt clearly state this.    This is very, VERY expensive compared to other seats out there - although, when I looked at it, it seemed very sturdy and quality-made.    Just take note about the lack of frame - this is the same as the other cheaper swing seats that is just a seat and rope.    Sending it back and getting the Little Tikes castle swing set and slide for only $20 more!
B000GK7AMU|5|Adorable!  Kids love them.  Bought them so kids could play with them with the Step 2 Water Table.
B00B1M2UNG|5|Very fuzzy and soft. Great sleep sack for our little one to stay cozy. Little warm for summer, but great for winter time.
B0002JETPQ|5|I love this gate.
B00SZ5UGWO|5|The bobs are cute, soft, and stay clipped.  The absorb well and look awesome.
B007HZBNZM|4|Each section is nice and deep and had good portion control.  Colors are also nice.  I tried to look all over the packaging and in other reviews whether they were microwaveable...they are NOT:  [...]    I wish they were so I could buy more, but not worth investing much more if they can't go in the microwave, as well.
B000LOPQ5O|5|Purchased this almost 2.5 years ago for my daughter's nursery. We've only used it as a night light a few times since she prefers to sleep in complete darkness however, I am sure as she grows older she will use it more. It is pretty bright, but it's not that bad. I really like this night light.
B00B9ZRYZY|5|Easier assembly than I thought.<br />Quick Delivery.<br />Very Sturdy.<br />I love how it plugged in to the wall!<br />That will be a lifesaver!
B006Z2BZBU|4|This was a gift for my mom's house for when the babies sleep over. It fit her non graco pack and play very well and one of the two grand kids slept on it well! Make sure you purchase a sheet or have one if you buy this mattress!
B000K53UEI|5|With twins, this spinning drying rack is constantly in use. Very simplistic design but, we could not live without it.
B00AJSIVWW|5|I ordered this for my daughter. It arrived on time as promised and was simple to assemble! Since my son came of the right age to be promoted to a booster i am getting him one too!!! Loved it!!!
B00068O22S|1|My one your old can get these open. Not very baby proof.
B003P9VS0E|5|so cute!!! was exactly what I was looking for, price was fair. I had done a lot of looking before make this purchase and all the bank were to big and round, this one had just the right balance
B002LARFLE|5|This is just a darling set. Sent these to my grand daughter yesterday , for her baby, that is due in just a month. very good quality.
B00KY50O2U|5|I love my bands for my twins bottles! It helps me tell them apart
B00BMVXXGO|5|Beautiful shower gifts for the guests and inexpensive
B003EUEUVS|5|These decals are great to add color and whimsy where you can't paint. They are easy to place and reposition and actually make me wonder if I will ever go through the hassle of anything beyond a very basic paint job again. Highly recommended and I will definitely use similar decals in the future!
B000823DN6|2|I was disappointed that the purple bunny was not a bright purple like in the photo.  For a moment I even thought it may have been used, but I'm sure it was brand new.  The purple bunny head is a sort of minky fabric that didn't look good.  I thought it would be cotton like the rest of the towel.  The bunny head section is very soft, but the color was a real disappointment.  It's barely purple.  Maybe I'd call it amethyst, but it's not a fun, pretty, purple.  The quality is satisfactory.  The towel section is not as plush as I expected.  Overall I was nonplussed with my purchase.
B00005BVK7|4|I purchased this mobile for several reasons, one being the remote control feature.  However, once I got it home and installed on the crib, I learned that your crib has to be in a certain position in order for the remote &quot;eye&quot; to work.  The &quot;eye&quot; is located on the right top of the music box that attaches to the backside of your crib.  If your doorway is on the left of that eye, then it will not work.  Other than the remote not working for my room set up, I thought it was well made and looked pretty entertaining...  P.S.  My nursery is a very small room.  The doorway is no more than 10 feet from the crib and maybe 4 to five feet to the left of the crib location.<BR>I took this back and purchased the Symphony in Motion.  It's very entertaining, a little loud because of the moving parts, and no remote...<BR>Hope this helps.
B000PBA03Q|5|This is the perfect stroller for my granddaughter.  She wanted a neutral color for her baby boy and now it'll be perfect for the little girl she's expecting.  It's great.
B009YDCH2S|5|Got it as a gift for a little girls first birthday she liked and so did her mom. Its not cheap material its very nice. Great buy.
B003I85VBO|5|Your baby is crying in the backseat. You reach your arm behind and feel around for the baby's pacifier, but you can't find it. Are they sitting on it? Did it fall on the floor? Are you going to have to pull into a parking lot and go on a pacifier hunt?<br /><br />Fear not! With the MAM Clip Trends Pacifier Clip, you can attack the baby's pacifier to a belt or blanket so you can find it easily. Just follow the ribbon to the pacifier and return to baby's mouth for miles of silence.
B00G05IEP2|5|Hangers worked great for the consignment sale I needed them for. Very sturdy. Arrived quickly.
B009Z4VZV0|5|Love the Bumbo booster seat!  Needed a highchair for my grandson to use at our house,<br />but didn't want a big clunky thing in the way.  This works perfectly for us!
B002MN3JY2|4|These are so much more comfortable than the disposable ones!
B00BEVSSDU|5|I bought this cup for my 6 month old baby because she is exclusively breastfed and has no interest in bottles. When I started feeding her solids I needed something she would actually use to drink some water out of while eating. She loves this little cup and the handles are great for her learning how to hold it herself. I went back and ended up buying 3 more just to have extras. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a little one as their first sippy cup
B0015VW4I4|4|This has been a great purchase for me and my family, it's really an excellent product. From the beginning, the shipment arrived as scheduled. Then the installation was very easy, if you are able to build a Lego car you can put this stroller together pretty quick. My two daughters love it, they even want to use it inside the house. The little one has just only one year and this is one of the preferred toys, it's very funny see her climb to get in the passenger sit. Just, be aware, that the back-sit isn't too good for big kids, I mean for for children with 4 years old or high, they actually fit, but if they are sleepy it will get very shrink(ish). The product is very endurable, I'm really very happy and I recommend anybody to get it, mostly if you want to rest a little when you are walking your kids in the mall or by the zoo.
B00BFQ5BM0|5|We've had them on light tan interior for several months now.  Not &#34;bleeding&#34; as of yet.  Will update if that changes.
B002QYW8LW|4|Good teether/distraction toy for 1 year old
B0002X7RYM|4|I'm really happy to have bought this for my daughter.  With all the uses, it's very flexible.  Since she was small, she should be able to use it for a few months.  We move it between rooms during the day and night.  The nightlight is great for checking on her at night.  I wish the different music stayed on longer (than maybe 10 minutes) though since it takes a while to get her to sleep.  It's also nice that the height adjusts since I'm short.
B002HQZZX2|5|My six month old daughter loves turning the pages of this book thanks to the bright colors and the crinkle of the tissue paper between the covers.
B000YDDF6O|4|Hello, and welcome to the land of musical toys. This toy can in fact be a life saver. It will keep the attention of any child for at least some length of time and can be used to shock them out of a fit. It has two setting for loudness so you can lower or raise it as need be which works well for when they are little and blasting it into their face at full volume might be scary. It also has a light display so it's kinda like baby laser Led Zeppelin with Mozart. The button is big enough that even an infant could hit it by flailing around a little. Every baby should have one. In fact every hospital should give one out along with the blankets and hats.
B002AQW6WM|1|Don't let the photo fool you, the animals are very small (the seahorse is 3\\" long). When we took them out of the bag, two of the toys had large grease stains on the bottom. I tried washing it off, but it does not come off. It smells like oil and obviously, not a good toy for a 9mo old to put in his mouth during bath time.
B00511J6IA|5|Great bag. Perfect size for me, and the stroller grips are a great bonus.
B002GDF3T2|3|I got this because I like the venting system for preventing gas/spit-up. and don't mind washing the extra parts, but I had the narrow version and wanted my baby to have something more human-nipple-like.  Unfortunately, these nipples are too flimsy (baby just gnaws on them to get the milk out...and then does the same on my nipples!), and the narrow part is much longer than real breast nipples (or longer than mine, anyway).  If you're not worried about nipple confusion and prefer wide-mouth bottles for ease of access for cleaning or something, these might be for you.
B00CSAWIP0|3|Runs very small for a 1 year old. She may be out of this quite soon. I gave away my wooden Eddie Bauer booster seat and I am so aggravated that I did. I can't seem to find another.
B0096PDWN2|5|If the little one likes it and it helps to soothe him, then there isn't anything more that needs saying.
B000V88HJM|5|I consider these a 'must have'. Especially if you are a nervous parent or first time parent. They do what you need them to and help to prevent lifetime  trauma by helping make sure you don't clip off a chunk of skin..... it can still happen, they aren't magic but it's kinda hard to mess up!
B0031ES95U|5|AMAZING. ADORABLE. BUY THESE NOW!!!!
B000JT2U6E|5|comfortable fabric, various flexible positions  Feels safe.    Ring has not been a problem so far.    Delivered on time, and would recommend it to buy.    We have 3 kids and of the slings we have tried so far, this is the most simplest and efficient.
B006SFUDQM|3|didn't fit tub spout, even after adjusting it everyway I could think of. tried it in 2 different houses- didn't fit either spout. :( not exactly thrilled with this purchase, but it does help a little bit against bumps, as long as the little one doesn't try to pull it off.
B001OC5UMQ|5|im still using it good product
B00GUT24J0|4|This was the only swaddler that I could find that would fit my big baby. It's nice that they make them so big, but they're over priced for what they are. The convertible part of it is very nice for transitioning out of using a swaddle. I never had issues with the snaps coming undone when I didn't want them to.
B0045I6IAY|5|We have bought these for our first baby that is on his way, so I guess we have to wait and see what he has to say about these pacifiers! :) A lot of positive reviews, so we are guessing, they are pretty good! It's cool that they are one piece, so it's less likely to do any harm to the babies. We recommend these!
B002WB2GB6|5|Ordered for trip to FL. First trip with baby on plane. Folded perfectly and held little man secure. Moves with ease and no bending over
B0037VMQNI|4|Thick and you can feel the absorbency.  Small length is perfect for newborns and neckline looks very comfortable and able to catch milk spills.  Haven't tried them out as baby isn't here yet, but they seem good to go.
B002ZW365W|4|It's only 6 pages and I do not think it is the full book to my dismay. It does come with crinkly pages, a heart teether, and a sound if pressed~ Good for infants but may not be so for older toddlers
B00CSAWJQ8|5|baby is 11 months old.  havent used it yet but it is cute.
B000EICY8E|5|Ok...So I bought this gate for three reasons:<br /><br />1.  My little one needed protection from the kitchen and stairs - so we needed a strong, study baby gate to prevent her from either falling down the stairs or playing in the kitchen without supervision. - This gate is PERFECT for this need.<br /><br />2.  We decided to get a large breed dog and needed a way to keep the dog in the kitchen while potty-training and when the baby was playing in the living room - Again - PERFECT for keeping dogs out...strong enough to not break and tall enough for no-jumping over.<br /><br />3. We use to have the wooden style gate that was short and not too strong and to go from room to room - I would climb over, everytime.  Being the tall girl that I am...I of course would trip and knock it down and ended up covered in bruises.<br /><br />So...as I have purchased several different gates in the past...this ONE is my FAVORITE.  IT's worth the cost for sure.  It's great for kids and pets (large ones to).  It opens in both directions which is very convient and I can still keep my tot out if needed.  It was easy to install and it's easy to use. But I will be honest, our extended family still hasn't mastered our gate...but then again they don't use it all the time - like we do.<br /><br />If I was to improve this product...I would put a slider on it somehow...so you have the option of leaving the gate wide open...like for parties.  Right now...if we want the gate open for a while, we prop the door open with a heavy object (stool).  Now that my daughter is 3, she helps herself in the kitchen, yet...at times we still need the gate, thus it's still up.  It's really not something you would want to put up and take down on a daily basis.<br /><br />So...in review...best gate on the market and a total must if needing a baby/pet gate.
B00474AT6K|5|I chose this pillow bc I didn't like the looks of the other 'body' pillows. They looked so massive and invasive. This pillow's the perfect size for my body, legs and the best of all, the bed. This way I can have comfort and somewhat snuggle with my hubby. My dog likes to sleep by the curve too...
B0036UK41Q|4|We recently bought our bumbleride indie twin in lava and although we haven't had much chance to use it I had to post a review.  I just wanted to say that the customer service is EXCELLENT!!!!!  Of all the products I've ever purchased and needed service bumbleride's customer service has been hands down the BEST!!!!!  They are very quick to respond and very accommodating. Although I had a very minor cosmetic problem which may not have been their fault, they were very quick to respond and eager to fix the problem immediately.  Within 2 days I had my problem resolved and the replacement part shipped to me via UPS with the tracking number.  They also seem to be addressing customers problems on Facebook as they respond to many of the comments / questions people have.      As far as the product itself, all I can say for now is that everything seems very durable and is well made.  Nothing on this stroller feels cheap (except for maybe the cup holder). It is very easy to push and is a very smooth ride.  Folding it is easy and fairly light and easy to get into the car.  Turning and maneuvering this stroller is very easy as well.  We tested this stroller in the store pushing it up and down very narrow asiles of the store without hitting anything.  Reclining the seats is also very easy with even one hand.  The canopy can also has a wide range of adjustment to block the sun even at the lowest angles.  I will update this review when I get more use of this stroller but so far am very happy with this purchase and with the service.
B001KZH69W|5|My husband bought this for me. I'm almost 9 months pregnant & wanted something to put under me in case I leak. Love that it's organic & no flame retardants are used. Once our baby is born I plan on using this for the changing table. Might have to get another one to go in the diaper bag as well.  I wish the company would put their products in ecofriendly packaging though. All their products I've gotten have come in non recyclable plastic bags.
B00KU112J2|5|I love this Avent Set. !!!!<br />It´s very nice all pink .. thanks.
B000056OV3|1|If you have a garbage can in your house, you do not need a diaper genie. I received it as a gift, so I stuck with it for a few months....having to buy the refills. Basically, my son was breast fed with multiple stools a day. Breast fed baby's stool does not smell bad enough that it has to be isolated. And even if my baby was formula fed...though their stools have a more potent smell, they don't have nearly as many per day. I haven't used it for months and he's 9months old.
B004184QAW|5|This only works with some Britax car seats so make sure you pick the right one.  It's the perfect size for my daughter's sippy cups.
B001IACJQ4|5|So far so good like the look. Easy to assemble. Haven't used it much baby not here yet! Hopefully everything will be fine with use.
B00AO0804E|4|i ordered this primarily because it was the right size.  It is better quality than I had expected.  I like the solid feel of the letter.  it is MDF, so it is sturdy.  The black is matte and there is a distressed edge on the letter so you can see the tan through the corners of the letter.  it was a nice detail to give it some dimension.  I painted mine and it worked great with the new paint.  I liked the back of the letter. There were two nail holes to be sure it is securely fastened to the wall and stays straight.  I was impressed by the quality of the product, given the great discounted price.  I would recommend this to a friend, though i would like to see additional font options.
B000096QQ5|5|I absolutely love these, I have to pump a lot so it saves a lot of time just being able to clean my parts and bottles and pop them in the microwave to sterilize. Wish I had bought these with my first baby! So many uses so you really get your moneys worth!
B005KWLEVW|3|It's nice and much cleaner than the cheaper mesh feeders BUT we used it just twice may be. My son never been too interested in it and would rather pick up tiny pieces of food from his tray. I think this little &#34;gadget&#34; is absolutely unnecessary
B00CHH2U0W|3|27mm is not the same as the actual medela brand 27mm
B0045Y176S|5|AMAZING!! We are big Batman fans and this was a treat to find. It's sturdy enough that my two year old will actually climb on it. It's safe enough he climbs in it. And it fits ALL of his toys. I also love the hinges on it, they make it so he cant close it to fast but he has no problem opening it fast!
B00IMN8SW4|5|Great prod
B00076SKZY|4|we use this for my potty training 2 year old when we are out and about and the public toilets are too big for her small tush. the top &#34;handles&#34; have a grippy under neath to keep the seat in place, but I wish there were grippies on the lower parts as well because the handles end up being off the sit sometimes and then there is no way to keep it from slipping around. It folds up nicely and fits into a little clear, thick plastic bag that it comes in. I wanted something that would fit into our diaper bag and hold up my kid on public toilets and this seat does just that. It's not the most practical, but it works for us!
B00913D2AC|3|Great idea,  but the suction cups don't stick so it slides around. Still worth it though.
B004IM8PDU|5|If you use TT bottles, these are really a must.  It's so much easier to prepare bottles for while you're out, and no need to taking the entire container of formula with you.<br /><br />It's also nice for when you have sitters.  You don't need to worry about them mixing the formula wrong because you can just set everything up for them before hand.<br /><br />They are easy to wash.<br /><br />holds up to 3 scoops of formula.<br /><br />Fits easily into the smaller TT bottles as well as the larger ones.
B001D20K40|5|We bought it because I went to get my son one morning and he had brown paint chips all around his mouth from chewing on the crib rail.  It covers the rail and holds toys for him to play with.
B00ARASMZ8|3|The height was too short for our mattress. I had to return it. The product itself seems functional.
B009EFFI5E|5|We got this today as a gift - we have not used it yet, as baby isn't due for 2 more months. I wanted to write that the color s beautiful. It feels very sturdy and it is so soft! I love the infant seat that it has too! It looks like a great car seat! I love that it is so bright and everyone can see it. Just need the matching stroller to go along with it :)
B00ADHRZEY|5|Really secure. Nice seat.
B001OC5UNK|5|I would recommend this gate to anyone that does not want to spend an arm and a leg on a walk-through gate. It is cheaper construction than say a hundred dollar gate but it works fine. It is very secure and I have no fears placing it at the top of my stairs. The main reason I bought this gate over others was that it was the only one to fit my opening and height. There are many other walk-through gates that are simply too tall.<br /><br />When you shop for a gate keep this in mind:<br /><br />1. What height do you need? If you buy something too tall then it will not fit.<br />2. What width do you need? Even though a gate says it covers a range of widths you still have to do the math and ensure that you don't have an odd opening that the extensions and 2&#34; braces on each side will not cover.<br />3. How much traffic will be going through this? If this will be a very high traffic gate then you probably want something more sturdy. Personally, we keep this opened at the top of the stairs and only close it when our little boy is walking around upstairs. We have a more expensive (i.e., sturdy) one at the bottom of the stairs because that is the high traffic gate since it is always closed.<br /><br />In the end, I would recommend this gate to anyone. It does its job perfectly and I would buy it again.
B00C2KW3FG|1|Great in theory but creaks so loudly that baby can't sleep. Very disappointed. It is also incredibly difficult to put together and takes two people. The creaking is ridiculous and very annoying.
B00OZDYT6E|4|Hard to clean ditched this one and bought nosefrida
B0074V0YI6|5|These are the best baby spoons in my opinion. They are nice and soft for baby's tender little gums, the scoopedness (not sure how to call it) is the perfect balance as it can hold runnier purees but baby can get her lips around it easily to get the food into her mouth. Plus they look precious. I'll probably buy more.
B00R208DKU|5|The hanging clothes storage box is absolutely necessary for any closet. It is very durable and holds many different things in each compartment. The hanging clothes storage box will help me to stay more organize with the different compartments and the durability of the storage.<br /><br />The storage is cloth, but under each compartment it is reinforced to hold the clothes/accessories in each section. I received this product at a discount rate. This is my honest opinion.
B00HIFM7XS|4|My daughter had to use these nipples until 2 months, the level one nipples were just too much for her. These worked well and we like the Dr Brown's bottles.
B0047GNVR2|5|It is so nice to have an extra base for our second car-  it makes installation quick and gives us peace of mind.  We have the Graco snugride 35 and this base is identical to the one that came with our Laguna patterned car seat.
B00A967W60|5|Just perfect for my granddaughter she has to have it with her all the time or she cries best gift she has ever gotten.<br />Don Abberger Fort Myers Florida
B004IM8PDU|5|Love these! Lids stay on nice and tight and the small opening for pouring works great even with small mouthed bottles.
B00CPM69OW|4|Great for playing and eating. I usually give my daughter one while I'm feeding her. They arent that great for using to feed her but she loves playing with them. The spoon doesn't hold much and its pretty flat so if I have to move quickly to avoid a swinging arm food flies off of it. She takes bigger bites than what fits in the spoon so its not really for eating as far as I'm concerned. The fat end is good for her little hand though and the silicone helps her grip.
B00OJMAHPS|5|Perfect for what I was wanting.  Fits our Maclaren Techno XT with no problems, have travelled Long Haul - NZ to LAX with this twice and have checked in the stroller at check in.  Bag was in great condition and protected the stroller well.  Would highly recommend this product to protect the stroller when checking in.  Rain cover and seat cover fitted perfectly into the bag as well with no problems.
B004L2JX1A|5|This is a great value and beautiful looking- bought this for grandma's nursery - soft fabric and comfy - Terrific!
B0026O98NI|5|Perfect for the parent worried about allergies
B00IYC2J78|5|Very cute and easy to stick anywhere you like.  if you mess up, you can just peel out and re stick elsewhere. The adhesive is great.
B00DSO71G6|5|My son loves these
B002DWALTI|5|My son loves this mat. We started putting him on this when he was around 4 weeks and he's now 4 months. I did add extra toys to it so now it's super busy. He will kick at the sides to make them jiggle and make noise. Being able to move the mirror is awesome because I can change it based on his interest at the moment or put it by him for tummy time. I like the twist to fold feature except I didn't have the patience to figure out the velcro part to keep it folded up. We usually leave it open ready for play anyways.  There are plenty of loops to move the toys to different places and add your own. There are even some on the sides of it. When I saw the pictures I wasn't that thrilled about the pattern but I actually like it better now in person than most of the ones I see in stores. He doesn't care what it looks like anyways.  It also comes with a little pillow that you can use as a baby prop up. It slides around for us though because our son is super wiggly and doesn't stay still especially on this.
B0057GU2AA|5|This is an adorable set.  It is sturdy and wipes clean easily
B002Q0Y8QO|5|I originally bought a BabyBjorn copycat product because it was cheaper.  The other product cut off circulation to my son's legs.  I then spent the money on the Bjorn and am incredibly happy with the purchase.  We wear this to the store and walking around the neighborhood.  Being on me helps my son stay calm.  Having two hands free helps me shop.  The straps adjust and my husband and I can easily share the same Bjorn without having to refit the straps too much.  My son still fits in this at 8 months.  I highly recommend this carrier!
B00NT6SBPS|5|Works Great. I can see the lil one with no issues. It stays in place too!!
B000GB0NZK|5|These are invaluable -- the kids love them because \\"I can do it myself\\" and mom and dad love them because they limit the mess.
B000K53UEI|4|I'm satisfied with this drying rack. It gets the job done. Bottles dont dry as fast on the bottom as they do on the top, The drip tray is kind of annoying, there should be a more secure way of attaching it.
B000QHOW6U|2|After using this three times, two buttons came off. When you pull the button off, you really need to be careful not to pull the plastic part, but the metal button it self. Of course it's cheap but didn't expect this to happen in three times of use. Now I am using a duct tape. Looks pretty awful...
B0078H54PY|5|My granddaughter loves this blanket! Extremely soft and cuddly! It's already been through the wash a few times and has held up well.
B000H1MRJO|5|Serves it's purpose. Not a bad price either
B006TTEEPS|5|- I love it. Was exactly what I expected and came so fast. My daughter loves it even if it's her timeout rug.
B000EI8L0O|5|I was torn between this gate and the superclose by North States. I opted for this one due to its height, hoping that as my puppy grows up, it will still be a sufficient disincentive. I'm very happy with the gate. The puppy is unable to sneak through (I had to purchase this one on account of him getting through the old one). Being pressure mounted, I was a little concerned about how solid it would feel, but it appears to be very well constructed and makes a pleasant click when it locks into place. Unlike the one by north states, this one doesn't stay open at a certain point, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me. The included extensions are nice, but the gate can also be purchased without them at a nontrivial savings.
B00012FGA6|4|I like this a lot but it is a little flimsy and i wish it was bigger
B00AHVR4N8|3|Little wobbly,  bulky, and somewhat hard to open
B006SFUEF2|4|My 6 month old does not sleep without white noise. Until now we had been using a white noise CD and playing one track on repeat, but when it would stop and re-play it would sometimes wake her up. Sometimes the CD would skip too, which was terrible. This nursery project and sound system is awesome! It has the perfect white noise (sounds like a loud fan) and it is ongoing. When I first purchased this product I thought that you HAD to use the timer, but that's not the case at all. You can have both the projector and sound system play continuously through the night if you like.<br /><br />Oh and the projector! My daughter loves it!!! I love that there are three sets of slides that you can use. They are all very colorful and entertaining. The reason I gave this product a four star instead of a five star is because of the fact that I think the projector is too bright. I wish it was a little duller or at least had the option to make it duller. It lights up the whole room which sometimes prevents my daughter from falling asleep. I also wish that the timer could be utilized for the projecter and we could let the white noise stay on all night,but unfortunately if you use the timer it affects both the noise and the projector.<br /><br />Overall, this product is awesome! I wish we had this earlier on!!!
B006ZFOBLS|5|great product
B00073HJG8|2|The dry wall anchors that come with it are too big and require too large of holes. They could easily have used smaller hardware.
B006SFUD44|3|My toddler has a lot of fun with these, but they don't last long, as he likes to take the crayon part out of the plastic sleeve.  Or he will push the white lever down to extend the crayon, then tries to draw with the stick, thus breaking the crayon... but he has a lot of fun, and it is a reasonable price, so we have bought them again.  As far as other products out there, we like these.
B007KFF10W|5|I loved how quickly they came in the mail and how easy it was to use these! When using a cloth diaper with a Snappi, it didn't leak at all! As long as you don't have ANY of the cloth diaper showing around the sides. I was totally surprised! I showed these to my friend and totally referring her to use these particular ones. The price was also MUCH cheaper than any other covers I viewed. $10+ for almost all of them. I ordered three of these covers and I got a 4th free and I wasn't even expecting it. Just as a suggestion for anyone using ANY covers: you really do need about 30-40 of them. They don't leak, but they smell of pee after used or you get poop on it and have to use a new one. I had only 4 of them and I didn't have enough. Haha. But you really can't beat this price. I've looked everywhere online. I'm posting this on all three that I bought. :D
B00004TFLB|3|We bought this toy for our 1 year old but even our 2 1/2 year old doesn't have the patience to figure out how the individual buttons work.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I love the classical music but the speaker in the toy isn't great.<br /><br />- There is no side to put the toy down on so it plays constantly in their toy box.<br /><br />- The removal of each instrument from the music just isn't a big enough change to teach the kids the different sounds the instruments make.<br /><br />It's an okay toy, there are some better musical toys out there and I wouldn't buy it again.
B000OY539A|5|I feel as this was the best purchase we've made for our baby. The first three months were much easier for me because we bought the Moby wrap. My newborn would stop crying and fall asleep the minute I would put him in the sling... I was able to do house work, cook, and use my computer all while my baby was peacefully sleeping on my chest. Before I had the sling, I spent all my time on calming my crying baby and putting him to sleep. It was very hard because I did not have time to do anything else besides feeding, changing, putting my baby to sleep and getting rest myself... When we got the moby wrap, it was a miracle!     I would recommend this to every mom.
B001W2CCY2|5|Bought this for our new daughter. Took a while to put together with a little help from my wife. The Graco product is well made, felt stronger than the competing brands I tested at ToysRus. Just wish that Graco had a color matched side table or dresser. Don't hesitate to purchase!
B006JB9906|5|Great for helping my son learn to brush his teeth. Its perfect size and has more realistic teeth so you can show him flossing too. Great gift or tool for kiddos
B00G34TIDW|4|The seat is great, once you get familiar with your car and the seat you can (almost) ditch the manual. It is poorly written, and has loads of confusing pictures, but the seat itself is very easy to install. My son seems to be comfortable, the straps fit well, and the headrest feels good and sturdy. :)
B00JFBXY4O|4|We have a similar neoprene bottle for our adult cups so we were looking for one for out little one's sippy cup as we noticed her bottles were getting warmer faster than ours and she always wanted to drink out of ours instead. Glad we found these. These fit over her Contigo sippy cups and she brings that cup everywhere: soccer, shopping, playdates. It keeps her drinks cold and the ice lasts a lot longer, so less her drinking out of our cups. I was worried about the sweating through the neoprene and getting the white parts of the zebra dirty but haven't had any issues so far. I would imagine if it gets yucky, just like our other neoprene bottle covers, we just throw them in the wash. Only thing that is a con about it is that it makes the bottle too thick to fit in any car seat cup holder, not the company's fault but something you need to know if you have a kid that likes to throw their sippy.
B005IWM7WE|4|My husband and I bought this product for my daughter, and I really love the fact that its 3 n 1 potty! My daughter loves it she took a liking to very fast! my only negative review is that it did say there was a built-in reward system and music I hear and see the music but I do not get what the reward system is, and also that the music when they pee is pretty quiet. other than that great product for its price
B006VIHL48|2|one of the nipples had a much larger hole than it should have! my breastfed baby gagged and choked until he projectile vommited! had to throw that one away.  other than that i like them.  they are made in china though :(
B0017KSMCK|5|This Baby Dolls Kira Doll is soft and cuddly . Small and just the right size for a small child. Just what I wanted when I ordered it.
B000KD7X02|5|My daughter uses it for my grandsons who are six and one.  It has become a good tool and the kids listen.
B0007CS4EU|5|These were perfect for freezing homemade food and worked really well.  The only thing is once my dude was a little bigger I had to use 2 cubes instead of just one as it wasn't quite enough.  (especially when he was eating my homemade and frozen mac n cheese!)
B00171WXII|5|My 13 months old daughter got an ear infection after just one week in daycare, and had to take antibiotics first time in her life. I was determined not to let that happen again, and looked for a way to keep her nose clear next time she gets sick, so her ears wouldn't be affected.  I found this online and am satisfied. Sure, it's not the best way to bond with your child, but it's one of those necessary evils. I used it as often as I could when my daughter got sick again, and we were able to get through a VERY long cold without her getting an ear infection.  Very nice!
B00Q3JLEO8|4|works pretty well for runny nose and helps to eliminate the redness/soreness around the nose area caused from using tissue paper.
B005GLH6UA|5|We love these blankets. They are very soft and warm. Great to replace the polyester ones as my son is allergic. :) We have bought several of these. :)
B00BLT1IZU|3|These sheets barely fit the bed. They are not soft to the touch; however, my little one sleeps fine on them. So I guess they are ok.
B0081ZOWG4|5|In the early months, babies do not know how to soothe themselves, and as parents, we try our best to calm them down by rocking, shushing, or singing to them.  But, when that doesn't work (assuming they've been fed, burped and have a clean diaper), try giving them a paci, and not just any paci... give them an Avent soothie.<br /><br />If hospitals are using it, chances are it's the best brand/product out there.  For the first month after my son was born, he did not take to a paci.  In some cases, that's a good thing since pacis are known to cause dental problems, but the reality is that babies do &#34;flip out&#34; and when they do... this is a life saver.<br /><br />An Avent paci is better than any other brand, but this particular one is vanilla scented - making it even better.  Another must have!
B0096E6ENS|3|Not the Same Blue Hue Color in the Picture-It is Darker in Person-Rastar 1/14 (actually 1/12 approx.)Corvette Grand Sport R/C.Sadly,No Hash Marks(Racing stripes on fender-which is an Option from Factory-Real one-heritage Package)as Evident from the picture.I have the Blue and The Yellow, Although the Yellow looks better to me,I wish I could have got the same blue from factory as pictured which looks nice,was told the photo it comes out lighter,It looks great still with the darker hue but came missing the upper taillight center which was replaced,The Yellow one Chipped a little easy,small green streak rear left I hope it is not going to happen to the rest,the paint and quality not the best but at the price and considering only other option for an 2010-2013 Corvette Grand Sport Model (Not counting Hotwheels and The New Ray 1/24 Toy that looks bad and the 1/24 Grand Sport diecast from Norscot which has taken forever due to Chinese Factory problem)at this time. So it can be displaed as is or run,I've run both and they run great and look great being run.I hope they last,since sadly it is chinesebrand and MIC(like almost everything.)Big scale And Correct Fenders and wheels for the Grand Sport as pictured.Wish there was other Variations Of this car and an 1/18 Diecast 2010-2013 Grand Sport Corvette with Hash Marks,until then this will do.
B00005NUNL|5|Please don't listen to the other comments.  First of all, these are not intended for drawers.  Take a look at the picture people!  They are for cabinet doors!  If you install them on cabinet doors (even nice ones) like I did, they work fine!
B005DOS2EE|4|This is a great gate. We get lots of complements on how it looks.<br />Pros: You can install it on walls at and angle, and large openings. It is hardware mount so it is not moving no matter how much your kiddo shakes it. Which is good for piece of mind. We feel that it is easier to patch a few screw holes than the damage that pressure gates seem to cause.<br />Con: It only swings one way.
B004EPYS7S|5|The wood was nice to work with.  It was easy to put together.  After putting the changing table together it did not shake when pushed on.  Very good.  [[ASIN:B004EPYS7S Dream On Me Jessica Changing Table, Cognac]]
B008KW8IWW|5|Nice chairs, fast delivery, and our kids absolutely love them. If you're looking for some great chairs for the living room or even a bedroom... This could be it!
B005Q3LSDO|5|We use these blankets every day. Perfect vfor swaddling and I also toss one over the car seat in place of a car seat canopy when we are out and about. Love the cute prints.  We get so many compliments.
B003KN27FU|5|Love this! It gives me much more peace of mind than throwing a blanket over the carseat. This keeps baby extremely warm, maybe too warm, baby only needs a few layers not a coat in this. I looked at other bundle me's but I loved this one bc it is waterproof - we had to go to his 2 month checkup and it was raining, the drops stayed on the fabric and didn't soak through. It fits good on our Graco Snugrider 32 carseat in Zurich.
B0026NCZIY|5|This is a good bib.  The waterproof material and pocket to catch things have made my life easier.  Recently my son gave himself strangulation marks trying to pull this off, so I have stopped using any bibs.
B006V84KFQ|5|No dripping!  Easy to clean.  Hold up well to drops from our daughter.  I will defiantly get more of them.
B00GXXQUKC|5|We have a 16 month and have been using cloth diapers from the start. Since we wash the diapers about every other day they have taken on a lot. This has stripped them Great. I suggest that you dry the diapers in sunlight too as it helps with stains.
B001NGFSMK|2|The idea of my toddler being able to eat by herself was intriguing; the reviews were encouraging, but it turned out to be a big disappointment.  First, the bowl is way too small to hold much food.  Then, my not-even-two-year-old started chewing on the spoon handle and the rubber actually came off!  Two months later, she somehow started to bend the handle, after just a few trials, the spoon broke into half!    I really like the fact that the bowl doesn't move, is microwavable and has a slanted interior easy for scooping.  But safety first!
B005ZXLS4E|5|Excellent, would recommend
B00DB5029K|4|We recently had to replace our Graco Infant car seat because we were in a car accident.  After quite a bit of research, I settled on this car seat because our 10 month old is on the larger size, 29 inches, and I wanted a rear facing seat that I could pull out and go with because he will fall asleep in the car and I can just move him inside and let him sleep in the seat.  It is a generous seat and very comfy, he sleeps well in it and I am pleased with the amount of extra room, I'm thinking we might make it until 15 months or so before switching him to the next stage seat.  My only complaint is the sunshade.  It is awful.  For an expensive seat, you would think the sunshade would at least be slightly decent, it looks and feels like it was an afterthought...It is difficult to move up and down and you can't adjust it so that the sunshade is on the lower part of the seat (which is nice to have if the angle of sun is glaring at your baby depending on the time of day) because there is no firm insert on the top part of the sunshade and it just flops around unless it is connected to the back of the seat at the top.  Clearly the designers have never actually used this seat with a baby in it.  I have resorted to moving the sunshade 2/3 of the way down and then flipping the back part of the shade up over the handle to keep it from flopping on my baby's face.  That seems to work and since we will only be in this seat for another 5 months or so, we are just going to make it work.  But...if this were my first car seat and my first baby and I thought it would be around for quite a few years, it would be a deal breaker for me because the sun shade is that bad.
B002XGHNGI|4|Do what they're supposed to! These pins open in the traditional manner for right-handed people. A bit expensive though when you can buy the kind that open the other way in bulk.
B00K0AV47S|5|Tried out the Britax B-Agile Double, Phil & Ted (single with double attachment), City Mini Elite Double, and Bob Duallie Strollers and the best one was the Britax...hands down.  I actually bought and used each stroller for at least a week.  I needed a stroller that could easily fold up into a slim profile and then not be too heavy or awkward getting into the trunk.  I'm also tall, so handlebar height is sometimes an issue I face, especially with umbrella strollers.  Adjustable height, doesn't move around much in the back of the SUV, pretty light compared to most, never snapped the red snaps and my kids turned out ok, and cleans up pretty easily--we've taken the power washer to it at least once.  I had the City Mini Elite when my son was born, was so fed up from it not closing properly that I retuned it when he was two weeks old and got the b-agile.  Best decision ever!  Now the kids are 3 and 4 and still using it!  Did I mention the head room is higher on the b-agile?  Cannot say enough good things about it.
B000NK5GJW|4|We gave away our first portable FP swing we had for our daughter. We were in the market for a new swing with our son. We bought a version of this swing in 2006 (ours has a different print than pictured here) when our first son was born. We decided on this swing and was sure the features would come in handy. He loved it and we used it until he was about 6 months or so. I pulled it out of the garage this summer before son #2 was born to see how it was. The swing wasn't working after being in storage. I didn't want to have to buy I new swing, so I took the motor cover off, vacuumed the pieces and sprayed some WD40 on the parts, added fresh batteries, wiped it off with antibacterial wipes, washed the seat cover, and it was as good as new.   I decided to write a review after I read other reviews.   Here is my take on it:  The toy bar is OK. It is a foam piece with 2 detachable stuffed animals. We added plastic toy links to the handles on the side and were fine with it. The baby liked to look around at the room more than the toys anyway.   I really don't like music on toys. We rarely used the feature.  To support our newborn, we added an insert that goes around the baby's head (like the ones in a car seat). It worked great to help support his head. We tucked a blanket in on both sides of the belt and that helped keep the baby upright too.   One of the main reasons we bought the swing is because the chair comes out. I don't think the swing is hard to remove or put back. You have to pay attention to where you have the back of the swing in relation to the bar for the seat when you are placing it on the base. Other than that, it is easy. I like the bar at the bottom of the seat that comes out so you can recline the seat when it is off the base. You can carry the baby into another room and they can sit in the chair to watch you while you are doing something. It can be a rocker or a seat.  The swing doesn't swing very fast and there isn't much difference between the speeds. I don't mind it and the baby doesn't seem to either.   Overall, we are happy with our purchase. Our second son likes the swing just as much as the first son did!
B00006SHRI|5|Moving your &quot;baby&quot; into a big kid's bed is probably  more traumatic for parents than it is for kids but if you're worried about falls in the middle of the night - this is the rail for you!  Our son has a twin &quot;big boy&quot; bed and this rail is long enough to leave about 5&quot; at each end and is high enough that there is no fear of him falling out (his mattress is kind of &quot;puffy&quot; so this should work well with most mattresses).<br />You do have to assemble this but since the railings are connected and the mattress holds down the connector bars, these will NOT slip off and onto the floor.  You can also adjust the tension on them to get a tight fit against the mattress.<br />I was expecting to have to go through a few products to get the one that would work for us but I'm glad I found this one because it works and it's well made.
B003I867US|5|ist perfect
B004Q7QOD0|5|Bedding for a sailboat theme room.  I was glad to find this sheet.  It will go great with the baby quilt that the Dad and Mom have already purchased.
B004AHKUHM|1|This monitor was great - but it didn't last. After a year the battery would not charge and the range became less and less. We found a batteries online ($15 each) hoping that a replacement battery would solve our problem. It didn't make any difference. Now, with our second baby here, I am searching for a new monitor. I am very frustrated and skeptical about every monitor because I don't want to waste my money again. Don't waste your's either.
B00MFAPWGK|5|So cute!
B00008KWO5|5|just a side note, the small fit my son up until he was about 7 months 1 week old. we bought the medium hoping it would be good and it wasnt... it is GREAT! there is plenty of room for him to grow in it and its long. if you live in a colder climate i would suggest at least a long sleeve onsie on under it like we use. our baby is a heat machine so he gets too warm in these with pjs on under it but too cold with just a onsie or pjs. great alternative to a blanket and much safer
B0043ZPVDO|4|It's the first time I tried washable nursing pads and they turned out to be great! I was a little hesitant at first when I saw all these colors shown in the pictures, I thought they were colored both sides, which I didn't like. But the colored side is actually the side facing your bra with leaking-proof! The inside is just natural white color, which is super soft, great for sore nipples. The pads are so big that they are perfect for nights, since I usually wear loose tops/bras at night and regular pads always out of place when I wake up. The only little problem I had with these bamboobies pads is, if you don't dry your nipples completely before putting them back on, it'll stick to your nipple a little bit next time you take it off. Overall awesome pads! I'm considering trying those heart-shaped ones!!
B001H0GF4C|1|The ordering process was easy, it's the product that is horrible. The first one I bought in the store and it only lasted 5 months. The one I ordered from Amazon hasn't worked since day one. I'm going to search for another brand of pumps because for as expensive as these electric pumps are they don't last long enough to pay the price. I'm trying to do the right thing for my son by breast feeding, but I work so I need to pump. It makes it really hard on my husband to watch him when I don't have milk to bring home for him to feed our son the next day. I've had to hand squeeze and its awful, because I don't want to spend more money on a bad product. I'm still trying to return the one I ordered but the customer center closes before I get home from work.
B0055DXEHI|3|These bib have a great snap system instead of the Velcro.  They are beautiful until washed.  After washing, they pill and shrink and do not look nearly as nice.  It is sort of a gause type cotton material.
B00IX6A3TQ|2|This is much smaller than expected.  Love all GUND products but was for a diaper cake topper and it was dwarfed by the monkey.  :(
B00B7M7BL6|5|This backpack has been a lifesaver for me and my toddler. I can now go out in busy areas, events, etc. and don't need to be in a constant state of panic. Trying to keep my toddler who is not scared of anything or anyone near me while out in busy areas has been a huge source of stress for me. I am always running after her or using my stern mom voice to tell her to get back by me (which of course doesn't work). For the active toddler this has been great. Its big enough that I can put in a diaper, travel pack of wipes, outfit, snacks, and even a small book, toy, etc. and she feels like she is doing something important by carrying her backpack. The leash has a little elastic give which is nice and the length is just about right.
B00CXVPB12|5|Shipping was super fast, the pillow cases are quite nice and the kids love them!  If your children like Jake and the neverland pirates, these are a great buy.
B008PODTBA|5|I bought this because I have 2 grandsons. One in kindergarten who is learning to write letters and his 2 year old brother who loves to mimic everything he does. They both love playing on this board, drawing shapes, and erasing them over and over.
B002W8IBPE|5|Another great product from StarSmilez, this is the third one I own now and just as the other two he's perfect. He's well made, with perfect teeth and super soft to the touch (besides the teeth) He does come with a toothbrush that works great and has suction cups on the bottom to stick to the side of the sink. My kids love these and so do I.
B00HNVWGNS|5|It's great!
B004C6C4HA|5|Mommy's lifesavers. My girls bite on these constantly puncturing holes on the tips! I didn't know I could purchase replacements and I found the best bang for my buck on Amazon!
B00J43OSWA|5|My daughter loved the item. It is cute! Good quality.Fits perfectly. Purchased this for my 3 years old (4 in September).
B00E3RKC36|4|The product is great however I'm not sure my baby really likes it at this point. I think the product is worth the price and I hope that when my baby gets a little bit older that she'll appreciate it too.
B00526ICYI|5|I got it to use for the play room since it's kind of far off from the living room and kitchen but since it's so easy to move I've moved it around to both my kids rooms too.  I love that it's so easy to move around and the picture is good.  I can even see very clear at night, which I wasn't sure if it had night vision or not when I got it but it does!
B007HJJ2F6|3|This stroller is compact when folded and lite, however mine broke after 2 weeks of use, I would still recommend this stroller as I don't think it's junk...these things happen sometimes. I just called the co. And they refunded my money. I just had to e- mail them a photo and receipt. The other thing I didn't like was that I kicked the wheels a lot when walking, if you walk like a super model with one foot in front of the other this won't be a problem.
B0000A1O7P|3|If you are intending to use this instead of a high chair and leave it in one place for a while, I highly recommend.  It looks more comfortable than some of the other b/c of the high back. However, it is a bit of a pain to set up and take down, as it actually has metal pieces that you have to click together before you attach to the table.  If you are buying this to bring to restaurants that don't have high chairs and intend to move it around and carry under stroller or in trunk of car, I would recommend the phil and ted's or mountain buggy clip on high chairs instead as they will be easier to set up.  They are more money, but trying to set this up while your 1 yr old is fussing is impossible.  It takes about 2 mins and is a pain in the butt.  Again, if it's to leave in your own kitchen and not move around, you will be very happy w this one.  If I were using it for that purpose, I would have given 5 stars, but in terms of ease of setup, I'd give it 2 stars, so I chose 3 as an average.  Just to add, it def seems safe.
B000P39OPE|4|My daughter fits in it perfectly now at three months (13lbs). It is helping her hold her head all alone and she is starting to reach for the toy. I feel like this seat will help her develop as long as she doesnt get too big for it. I like that the set has a soft shell and I only wish the tray had some padding on the underneath. My babies legs bump the top while she stabalizes herself. I can imagine being disappionted if I had purchased this later in her development so I would suggest getting it earlier than later in the 3-14 month time frame. When I bought this product I felt a little guilty that I spent $60 on a seat but when I put her in it and saw her reaction it was worth it to me (still feel like it is alot to pay for a seat when highchairs cost the same).
B00CU5M67I|3|The material is excellent for the heat of summer, but whoever thought tiny metal snaps were a good idea has clearly never tried to swaddle a kicking and screaming baby at 2 in the morning. Velcro would make this perfect.
B00BWRPCB2|5|cut pillow that my boy loves. makes the car ride easier since he can put it on and pet the doges ears until he passes out. the fur is so soft and smooth the ears are floppy and it fits around my neck. but I don't get to play with it much because every time I use it to relive neck pain my boy snatches it from me and says no no mommy its my Bella dog lol. the toy dog looks like our real dog Bella
B00Z7Q5WTQ|5|Very pleased with the product.  It was purchased for a baby present.
B00BW2VZCW|3|This seems to work well, but I have others that have broken that have been made by the same company.  Since I am concerned about it breaking too, we use it rarely at bed time.
B00KCNJ7NQ|4|The bottles have worked well for my daughter.They are easy to clean, assemble/dissemble and the bottles do not leak. I have not used the handle yet; however, my daughter can hold onto bottle quite easily.
B009MYGBV2|1|ALL I can say is EWWWWWW! Really cheap looking and poorly made.  Don't waste your money.  Not worth the time to order.
B0013N5MX8|5|I bought this as a bunny plush collector, but it's clear that this plush is best suited for babies and nurseries. Not just as a decoration, it's appears to be a very good safe plush with no parts to fall off or get pulled out, etc. Eyes and nose are sewn in, nothing can break off. Very soft good squishy bunny plush that is a joy to pet like a real bunny (and it can't bite you or make a mess like a real pet rabbit, which I have one as well- mine is scary but somehow sweet too).<br /><br />I got the Petal bunny which is naturally adorable in every way. It has a strange overwhelming charm (being a bunny with pink fur) and is handmade, adds to the love all around.<br /><br />This very soft plush happens to be very small in size, but very portable for those on the go. I appreciate the smallness of Petal bunny as my bed is overrun by stuffed animals from Hello Kitty/Charmmy Kitty, Build-a-Bear Workshop plushes, bunnies and more bunnies of all sorts.<br /><br />So, I'm thankful for the smallness, but could be a problem for others because of the high price. Though the smallness is more the right size for a baby to hug and hold instead of a larger plush that could do possible harm. No worries here on this soft small bunny. I love this super cute thing :)
B000U404OI|3|This lamp matched what I was going for but it was way more expensive then it should have been.  It is a basic wood design lamp with nothing special.  Cute but not worth it.
B009M63NVG|5|I got these for their sizes and sealed caps. I wam so glad I picked them up. I do not use these for baby food. I use them for freezing wine, herbs and  reduced stock. They are clear with calibration so you can freeze according to recipe amts.  They seal tight with NO leakage. They clean like a dream.<br /><br />I have also used them for making up refrigerated ingredients in recipes ahead that call for numerous items. With the trays included, I can set up the recipe  in tray for a day or two of meals. I plan on getting more to do a week's worth at a time to save myself the hassle during the week.  A tray a day, my motto.
B002FB7FLY|5|SO absorbent! Used one of these with a microfiber when he was under 6 months, but then needed two of these hemps after the 6 month mark.  Works every time - he can go 12 hours in two of these!
B008DVI3KM|5|We love the Sophie. My son's favorite toy for the first year of life. We have almost always ordered from amazon (with the exception fo one that my grandmother bought him at a store) and they have all been of equally good quality. My son loses them easily, so we are on Sophie number 4, I think.
B0088K8T8E|5|I bought this for my 20 month old to start transitioning out of sippy cups. He's still learning to get the hang of it; meaning he usually spills quite a bit on himself, but he's doing so much better than he did with a regular cup. Its great for dinner and snacks when he is sitting at the table with us. All around I think this is a great transitioning cup and I would buy this over and over again!
B007ZZCPZ6|5|Besides a strange smell when first opened, this is fantastic. I let mine air out for a night and they're fine now. Everything is perfect. The boxes are nicely sized and I think they're amazingly useful for organization. The large hanging shelf thing is a little smaller than I thought, but it works great. I have blankets, onsies, socks, and bibs on it. I love it so far. The organizers have little stickers to write on if there was something else you wanted.
B004CIYOJO|5|I buy this brand of socks exclusively for both of my girls.  These socks are lightweight and have good footing at the bottom for traction.
B00508MV7C|5|Going on two years and it still looks like new!
B003N64Z7W|5|This has helped a lot this year. Fit perfectly on our stroller. Need it when I have to pick up my daughter from school at times lately when it is raining a bit. Kept my son dry. Other mom's thought it was pretty neat and a great thing to have! You never know when you may need it!
B00H8IO1PW|5|I was very impressed with the sheer amount of bands that came with this product! I am new to loom bracelets and was confused to discover that the loom is square shaped. It can be rearranged by taking off the blue bases. It would have been nice to receive some instructions as a first time user.  Overall, love the product and would have left 5 stars even without the incentive insert. :)
B001VEP4VY|5|I just wish I had one of these to sleep next to! It's a deep, rich color and so super soft. Very well made!  Washes and dries very easily and holds it's shape well in the wash.
B00F8QGZ6Y|5|Good value for money . Its real good product. It is easy to use. I will recommend this to all parents
B00JS4DIKS|5|We love that these are BPA free! And they are a great size for young babies. Very flexible and soft, which is awesome- they will not hurt baby Waldner when we rolls on top of them. I love that the handle is stationary and not flip down- baby can always grab it easily.
B007HM729Q|5|Exactly what I was looking for...super soft, my son sleeps with it every night.
B005AJQXTS|2|Nice set but crib had marks and chipped wood in two different places
B00BLTEIA2|5|I bought these sheets based on others reccomendation of getting the Gerber fitted for the 50 coil mini crib mattress.It fits great!<br /><br />I also love that their comes two in a pack, that way if one gets dirtied (as will happen with a baby!) Then you have another to put on.<br /><br />Really cute. Although I was a little disappointed that the flower print looks faded as if it had been washed a lot, even though I had just taken it out of the package.
B0011MOVOW|4|I love this collection.  We also have the swing.  The only issue I have is that my son outgrew this item too fast.  He was 8lbs 8ozs and 22 inches at birth.  He's now two months old and 24 inches and has no more room in the bassinet.  I feel really bad because it's an expensive item.  One other thing, one of the screws for the handle didnt fit well so we left it out.  The handle stayed attached, but it should have fit better considering the price.
B000S35QLC|1|We got this monitor on the recommendation of a friend when our son was born two years ago. I've finally given up and am back on Amazon shopping for its replacement because after years of frustration (and visiting a friend with a normally functioning monitor), I just can't take it anymore.<br /><br />1. Beeping. As other reviewers have noted, this monitor beeps. Not just a quiet little beep, but this loud, irritating, ear-splitting beep about every 30 seconds. I've tried different channels, placing the monitor in different locations around my toddler's room; nothing solves the problem.  In addition to the interference beep, there's another annoying constant beep that chimes whenever the monitor thinks it's too far from base. This beep frequently starts when I am still very close to my son's room.<br /><br />2. Voice sensor.  The monitor's voice sensor is very sensitive. So much so that if there is ANY tiny noise, the thing turns on.  There's no point in having a monitor that is \\"voice activated\\" if it is turned on most of the time because it is too sensitive (car driving by turns it on; sound machine in baby's room turns it on).<br /><br />3. Static. Even when it functions as it's supposed to, he sound is not very clear. I didn't realize how bad it was until I recently visited a friend who has a new clear-as-day monitor.  This sony is just bad.
B001IXYOD2|5|Definitely the best value. Don't forget your preemie-flow nipples!
B0038OLMXE|1|edelivered without the bolts and small hardware  cannot use the baggy of small parts didn,t come in the box.  still in china i suppose. company won,t respond.  junk it and cross that company off doing business with.
B004A9ZF3Y|4|These are great.  Made of good quality.  Free of BPA and other bad chemicals.  I researched for hours before deciding what to buy.  So many items got low reviews because they cracked or the lids would not stay on.  I wanted something I could freeze and leave in the container until I was ready to use it, but I was going to end up spending tons on money.  I only found two products that looked decent, but did not want to spend so much. I turned to these.  They are not really what I wanted, but I am happy to see that they are not made in China like everything else.  Maybe Mumi & Bubi will come out with other products for storage of baby food.  I do have problems getting the food out.  I have to run warm water over them and then let then sit for awhile.  I tried rubbing a little coconut oil in each one, but I am not sure it is making a difference.  I still like how easy they stack and the size of each portion.
B00QHW5LQS|4|Arrived in a short time, product was what I wanted and great value for the price.
B0000E0JDV|5|There is no gap for your child to potentially fall into...it locks ontop and if you use it right, you can easily change your sheets.  It is the only one to be considered, even though it is more expensive.
B000ETAJG2|5|My mom never had time to potty train me, and after 23 years, I can finally learn! It was easy to do (even though it overflowed a few times after Taco Bell) I could put my picture in the seat so it made me want to learn! Bye bye diapers!
B0043D2A9O|5|This Car Seat is great? I purchased it for my grandbaby for my own car so we dont have to move it from one car to the other.  The installation was very easy and quick.  She is so comfy in it.  She loves it because she can face forward now and see what is going on and I love it because I can see her.  GREAT CAR SEAT!! LOVE IT!
B005XRV69E|5|Love these sheets!  All the farm animals on the sheets are so cute.  They fix the crib just great.  Love the colors.
B000IDSLOG|4|I like this teether because it is so easy for baby to hold and explore. It is soft and durable and very cute, too. The teether's squeaking mechanism can be a little loud, but it is fine with me.
B00CJULQUC|2|Toddler boy pees and splash everywhere
B001NAATWK|4|I like it, was shipped quickly the ear thermometer works perfectly, it shows a green ligth when the temperature is lower than 37.5 and a red ligth when is higher. The only thing why I didn't put all the stars is because the other thermometer do not shows Celsius degrees
B0002E7DIQ|1|terrible product
B000HCJA0C|4|I really, really WANT to give this diaper bag a 5-star review, honestly.  It is adorable, durable, has very useful back-pack staps, has lots of pockets, comes with a little bag for mom and a travel-sized changing pad... but it is simply TOO SMALL for my needs. I really don't think I require too much space, but it seems like everytime I try to pack this bag up, I am fighting to zip it shut because it's just too full. I've tried cutting back on what I need to carry, but I think I just need to give up and get a bigger bag. However, if you are lower-maintenance than I am, perhaps this is the perfect diaper bag for you and your baby!    Grade: A-
B009Z4VR9K|5|This cute little flamingo never fails to intrigue my little girl. She loves the realistic chirping sounds when she shakes it. She also loves to chew on the legs. A hit!
B0065LTW52|1|This pump is terrible. I have had it for about 4 days and it doesnt work. At the highest settings I get barely a tug. The customer service line is not a 24 hour line so you cannotget any issue rectified any time of day. I am currently waiting on customer service to call me back.
B00H0DH2KG|5|Best bottle ever . The only one my breastfed baby likes !
B002HOQOVQ|3|These are cute and do their job but the small bag is literally useless unless you use it for something like a pacifier... and my kids never used pacifiers. Other than that theyre washable and durable with cute designs and handy drawstring.
B004N2ZK1A|5|i got this plate for my daughter  she loves it i also got the bowl with it. cute set together, perfect for meals
B002NS1DDK|5|i got this for my granddaughter  so i could make her a baby book while she was here with me when her parents are at work.it colorful and has alot of great stuff in it.
B00G15LRWS|3|Pricey for stackable cups that doesn't actually snap close. It will tip over easily since they really just stack on top  of each other.
B001QXDT2G|1|I ordered this towel because my 18 month year old has outgrown his baby towel.  The towel looked cute and had lots of good reviews.  I was very disappointed when I received it because it was flimsy and pilled and looked used. While it is a cute design there is no way I would pay this price if I had seen the towel in person.  It would be worth like $9.99 in a store.
B00A0FGN8I|1|I seriously hate this car seat. I'm giving it one star because it's sleek looking and has good safety ratings, but those are the only decent things about it. I bought it for the safety ratings and, in part, because I wanted it to match my Uppababy Vista stroller. Huge mistake. The biggest negative is that the straps become uneven basically every time I try to tighten them. One strap is very loose (able to easily pinch the fabric with my fingers - a huge safety no-no) while the other side is way too tight. It's dangerous and uncomfortable for my baby. Nine times out of ten I have to take my baby out, pull the straps all the way out and back and spend a few tries getting them even before I start again. It's the biggest pain in the neck, I can't even tell you. And try doing this when you don't have an extra adult to hold your baby. I called Uppababy customer service about this. They provided me a quick replacement seat with little trouble; however, the new seat does the exact same thing. When I spoke to them again the rep said that it is normal to have to readjust the straps &#34;from time to time.&#34; Well, I have to do this nearly every single time. If I don't do the adjustment I am sure it is a safety hazard for my baby should (God forbid) there be an accident. The rep said they don't do refunds but they can basically keep sending me the same God-forsaken seat. Also, it really irks me that I bought the top of the line Uppababy stroller and you need to use attachments to put their car seat on it. As other reviewers have said, the canopy pops out easily and is difficult to put back, and the canopy does not extend far enough forward to protect baby from the sun. When my son was a newborn he looked super uncomfortable in it. It didn't come with a newborn headrest insert like some of my other friends had in their (less expensive) car seats. Their babies looked cozy and secure while mine had his head cranked at an uncomfortable angle. I purchased another brand of infantinsert but it didn't fit so we had to put a receiving blanket rolled up around his head, which I wasn't totally comfortable doing. He didn't really &#34;fit&#34; in it until he was close to two months old, and we had a big baby (8 lbs 12 oz at birth). Not to mention the extra base was $130 which seems excessive. And the seat is heavy as heck. Those extra couple of pounds really do make a difference, and I'm a fit, athletic woman. I expected much more from a $300 car seat. This was the biggest regret of all our baby items and if I had to do it over again I would have definitely purchased a different seat. Don't make my mistake.
B001F50FFO|5|I've used these bottles to pump into for years now. These fit the medela pump horns snuggly, and are glass, not plastic, so I don't have to worry about taste changes or leaching chemicals.  These do shatter if dropped hard, so I don't send these to daycare. I store the milk in the glass then put them in a safe plastic bottle for transport to daycare.
B000G1YW98|4|This is bigger than it looks. Good quality.  My engineer wishes bases were weighted more (additional stability), but so far so good.
B004CJ0P2I|5|Excelent!
B00IJZNIHK|3|It looks well made, but it doesn't have pockets like most diaper bags. It looks nice, though.
B0052QOKXA|2|I ordered 3 of these. My 14 month old shattered one in the grocery store within 5 days.  She broke the plastic sippy part on the second 3 days later.  Not impressed.
B004W8IP9E|5|My daughter likes this type of swaddling blanket. In the very beginning, we used this blanket to swaddle her when she outgrew regular swaddling blanket. This blanket is thin, never blocks air way. We would not worry if my daughter puts this blanket around her face. When she is bigger, she chewed this blanket while going to sleep. That's fine. We washed it every day. We totally bought 5 SwaddleDesigns Marquisette Swaddling Blankets. So she always has a clean one to &#34;chew&#34; when the others are in washer/dryer. Now she is 3 years and a half. She does not chew the blanket. But she still wants to hold it while in bed. All the 5 blankets are still in their shape. Great quality!
B005MQR80W|5|i have a 3 1/2 yr old and am expecting twins.  for months i tried to fit 2 infant seats and one booster car seat in my toyota rav 4 and nothing fit. i tried every possible option. i finally decided to try the Diono RadianR120 with 2 graco infant seats on either side of it and it fit perfectly. when the twins grow out of the infant seats i will probably purchase 2 more RadianR120.
B00073HJG8|5|Looks great!!! Suuuuuuuper stretchy though, make sure to hang it all the way up at the ceiling. It stretches really big! I pulled the sides about 2-3 feet on either side from the center and all the way up to the ceiling, trust me, you'll be glad u did
B000096R5H|5|I have had no problems with this bedding. My daughter is now almost 2 and she still uses it in her toddler bed. Nothing has fallen apart no matter how many times I wash it. And at my house it gets washed weekly. Of course we do not use the bumper or sheet any more, they didn't fall apart when we did. The quilt has been washed over 50 times and is still in perfect condition. Maybe other poeple just got faulty sets.
B003ETR0Y8|4|The verdict is still out. Definitely agree with others...the folding could be easier.  So far I have pinched my finger 3 times just in the process of practicing to fold and unfold it. (directions stink) I think I have it now.  Other than that, seems to be pretty good.  Is compact but I would not say lightweight.  Seems to steer really well, even one handed.  I, being 5'7\\" wouldn't mind adjustable handles and my husband is 6'3\\" and would like a wider \\"oval\\" when pushing with two hands.  The back storage area is bigger than I expected so, bonus. I know the weight limit is 40lbs, but I liked the size when folded.  I have a very above average (height & weight) almost 3 year old, and at almost 50 pounds, it seems to still be sturdy.
B004GXA6LA|4|We got this for our 1-year-old daughter to use in Grandma's car and it's a perfect fit.  The material is nice and she seems quite comfortable in the seat.  It's definitely a bit on the bulky side and she prefers her primary Recaro seat, but for a part time seat for a great price, we totally recommend!
B001GQ2PN2|2|this is just gonna be about the stroller. I don't have any qualms about the car seat. The stroller is big, heavy and doesn't steer well. I've been using this since 2010 and i'm ready to get another stroller. Don't consider unless you own a SUV.
B00DNGLN0E|4|Works great, I just wish that the arm was a bit longer. It screws at each link on the arm to tighten it and prevent it from flapping in the wind.
B001QXCDAU|5|Love, love, love. I can't give it enough stars! Our baby has MSPI, and while we were figuring things out, he would cry and fuss no matter how you held him and he wouldn't let you put him down. I had this sling sitting in his drawer so I decided to use it even though I hadn't with any of my others. He immediately went to sleep, no more fussing, and I was able to actually eat something and do a load of laundry!!! It literally saved my sanity, I will wear him as much as possible!
B00LZ8JI2C|5|Well done!!! Beautifully packaged!!Gorgeous!!
B00CXVKGXU|2|I was looking for an easy way to make formula and have it the right temperate, ready to feed.  I've had it less then a month and when I went to press the button to turn it on-- it didn't.  I tried everything from unplugging it and trying to reset it with the buttons on the side and nothing.  Needless to say I will be returning it.  I really liked it when it was working. My only problem besides the fact that it isn't working anymore was the fact of the plate that holds the bottle seems flimsy. Disappointed to say the least!
B004U8XHA8|5|My son loves his lovies! I bought these so I could have extra and trade them out when they get dirty.
B004V3CGZ4|5|So glad I found these glow in the dark pacifiers.  They are much easier to find when the baby loses it during the night.  Great find!
B009W4B55O|5|I bought this for my niece. She loved it.
B007NG5UEU|4|This product works perfectly well in my two floor house. The device is sensitive enough to capture all sounds. It kind of works like an always on two way radio, and we sometimes use it like one to communicate. My only gripe is if you accidentally bring the parent unit into the same room as the baby unit (when on) it picks up the feedback and can get very annoying. Otherwise its a great device that does what it promises to do.<br /><br />I can't comment on the life of the device as I've had it for just a week.
B00JVRFUJE|4|Bigger than I thought it was going to be. My boy didn't show much interest. Maybe when he gets older. Otherwise it's a pretty cool toy and teether.
B002UXQRES|4|These by far were my favorite bags for storing breast milk in when I was nursing. I tried a few brands and since I could find these at a decent price online, these became my go to. I produced quite a bit of milk and needed to pump when I went back to work - I stored milk in the fridge and freezer - no issues with leaks or freezer burn or anything.  If you drop them when the milk is frozen, they will often crack or break (not unexpected of things in the frozen state), but I had no issues otherwise filling them, labeling them, storing them or thawing them. I will use these again if we have another baby.
B006ZISRRO|5|If you want the safest and prettiest infant seat on the market for a baby girl get this one!  I already spent days researching and reading reviews. We had the same seat in black and silver for our grandson and we loved knowing he was so comfortable and safe when traveling with us. We still could use it, but I just wanted something pretty for our granddaughter. The seat arrived a week earlier than expected in perfect condition just like the first one.  The fabric is easy to clean and installation is easy.<br />Hurry because this one is going fast. I got mine in about two weeks. You can buy additional bases here at Amazon. Be sure to get the one for the air on board.
B00NUCWGMU|4|really like it. It's just a lot bigger than I thought it would be. And the plastic clasp at the back should be rubberized because my son who likes to chew things, chewed them and broke them.
B001A690UO|2|We got this off our Baby Registry. We read the reviews and decided on it. The real truth is that it has very bad reception/range. They are still using regular radio frequency when digital should be used. Whenever my wife or I pass in the pathway of either the receiver (the portable part that you listen to) or the base, there is interference and static noise! ...and our apartment is not that big! If you don't wake the baby up... the static will definitely do the job!  This is one of the very few Sony products that I am disappointed in.     The good features:    Good build quality.   Good Looks  Water Proof  Rechargeable    The Bad:   Reception  Very difficult to hang it on anything
B003LQSCR8|3|The cart cover is super cute! We haven't used it yet, so I can't speak to how it fits, but I'm excited for when we'll be able to use it soon! Our daughter is almost 4 mos and doing great with holding her head up, so I think I'll FINALLY be able to take her to the grocery store soon, without having to put her entire carseat in the cart!
B007P58ODS|5|Love these cups! I have 3 in different colors and they are awesome! Yes, if you leave the top open and turn it on it's side, the contents will spill out. If you close and lock (when you hear it click) the lid, no spills, ever! Because my 3 year old uses these cups, I have a simple &#34;water only&#34; rule for them in case he leaves the lid open and it spills - but that's no problem with the cup, it's a problem with the user. :)
B008O3OIXU|4|Could be a little more sturdy but overall it serves it's purpose.
B002XVRKHK|5|The washcloths are fine. They're soft enough for washing baby's tender skin and there's alot of them for the price.<br />The included toy wasn't a selling point for me, but we've had so much fun with the stupid toy! We hide it, we put it in things, he practices reaching and grabbing for it. It's soft and just the right size for a baby's hands. I really never thought we'd like the toy :)
B000132W02|2|I was not going to purchase this bassinet after reading the poor customer reviews but ended up receiving it as a gift. I put it toghether and all was going well until the very end. One of the wooden ends was split in two. I called the manufacturer to have a replacement part sent to me. They informed me that this particular piece could not be replaced- they would have to send me an entirely new bassinet. Fine. But first they would have to send me paperwork to fill out to prove that the bassinet was in fact in unusable condition. Then I had to take it completely apart and ship it back to the company before they would send me a replacement!!! I had a fit and told them this was inexcusable and I would not go to such lengths for THEIR faulty product. I am still waiting and it's been weeks. Baby is almost here now so I probably won't get to use it and will end up with a broken bassinet. STAY AWAY FROM THIS \\"B\\" IS FOR BEAR LINE!
B00C0XIVG0|5|This picture frame is very well made, and absolutely adorable!  The colors are crisp and the lines are sharp (no color &#34;bleeding&#34; or fading).  A wonderful keepsake of that special day!!!
B002J4U8SO|4|My one year grandson loves this car.  Pull it back and it runs about 30 feet and off he goes to catch it.  I wish there was a way to designate front to back, because the pull back action is only one way and the front is not clearly identified.
B003QZ1TE2|5|Just what we needed for our trail-a-bike.  Works perfectly.
B006ZSYIAE|5|I absolutely love these blankets. I bought blue ones for my son, and pink ones for my niece and they love them. They're lightweight and breathable, so they're perfect.
B002XNK2VO|5|Bought this for my wife when we were expecting baby number one (2 years ago). Baby number two is almost here, and the wife still loves and uses it. Highly recommend!<br /><br />Edit - baby #3 is about to make his arrival, and this pillow is still going strong.
B00H5OI9XO|5|This cooler bag can last up to 12 hours! I use this everyday at work because my work's fridge sucks!
B0055WDND4|5|worth the money, wasnt expecting anything great. i threw it in the washing machine on the hand wash cycle and the lining was badly torn.
B00006966I|1|I started nursing my baby and had to switch to formula, so I tried these bottles. My baby seemed to be spitting up quite a bit, so I thought they would help. I read the instructions and followed them to a T. My baby couldn't get anything out of the bottle, so I tried myself. The baby (or you) have to &amp;quot;bite&amp;quot; the end of the nipple to release fluid. I called Playtex, and they said that to make the nipple work, your baby should only use the tip of the nipple, not the rounded area closest to the bottle.   To me, this is a little backwards, since I just spent all this time teaching my newborn not to take just the end of the nipple. I'm not quite sure how you teach a 5-week old baby to &amp;quot;bite!&amp;quot;   Needless to say, if your baby has nursed, it may be hard for him to figure these out. I simply use other bottle nipples with the bottles I couldn't return.
B00CNUTQZK|5|Perfect for my 3-month old.  Still used a swim diaper underneath.
B007VDK59A|2|Ordered &#34;Baby&#34; version for our infant, and we received the regular non-baby version.  Very disappointed.
B006ZM043U|5|Nice
B006P05SHO|5|Product does the job it was designed to do.  Keeps the bath area organized and provides easy clean-up.  Item arrived quickly.
B000069RAO|5|Seriously- I can't! Even at 6 months I still nurse her on her boppy- we are both more comfy and cozy! It travels well and can be used for so many other things too! It can used for belly time- my daughter wasn't a fan of belly time so I put her so her arms were over the side and her legs were in the open portion. She loved it- we took great pictures and she was still building those core muscles. Now she sits in the circle and I know if she falls over she's cushioned and safe.  And even though she is young you can still see a sense of satisfaction in her face like hey look mommy no hands! My 2 recomendations? Get 2- 1 for home and 1 for travel- then you always have it for whenever or whatever you need to use it without trying to remember it each time- there's enough to remember each time you leave the house. And #2 get an extra cover than one can be on while one is washing! Enjoy! Hope this helps!
B001H9NXE8|5|Three years later and this toy chest is still going strong.  Strudy.  Easy for small ones to dig through.  My daughter has enjoyed this toy chest from the moment she received it ( less than a year old) and still loves it now (3 years old).
B006Z6E8AG|4|This was a great purchase.  It accomplished what I needed which was an easier way to mash steamed fruits and vegetables with a quick clean up.  Its not expensive and much easier to clean than a food processor.  The only drawback is everything has to be made in small batches.  As you mash the mixture tends to creep up and over the sides.  But I t's still better than mashing with a fork!
B0010LR812|5|Our baby loves this!!!! She actually enjoys this method of brushing her teeth. Normally it's a struggle at bed time to brush her teeth. But this way she thinks it her idea. And it's fun!
B001F8TOQ2|5|This is the softest, coziest pillow you can buy. It doesn't need a cover either. All you need to do is toss it in the wash. It is also the PERFECT size to take a snooze on in the car seat!
B00CSAWIN2|5|Love how versatile this chair is. rv, kitchen table, picnic table, restaurant, or couch. it gives my grandchild a safe and comfortable place to eat. he loves it which is most important
B001I7PY1E|3|What can you say about a bath mat? It adheres well, it's clear (a plus) and it covers most of the tube. I am skeptical about the machine washable part, but I'll report back on that.
B004OEPLJ8|4|This wasn't the first choice for me, but money played a part. We've been using it 18 months with no problems. The boy is comfortable and still rear facing (just waiting till he's heavy enough to flip). There has been a bunch of spilled snacks, water, milk spilled in there, and it does clean easy. Adjustment takes a bit of getting used to, but is easy and I don't have any other reference.
B00BRHSBTC|1|Do NOT buy this thermometer... It does not work.  My 14 month old was rushed to the hospital because it was reading her tempature wrong. It was tellinge 102..or 101.. When we got to the hospital it was 105!!! She was becoming unresponsive..  I cannot believe they sell this.<br />We also purchased a monitor from summer infant that was not reliable, they said if we returned it we would receive a refund.. And we returned it and Never received a refund.  The monitor experience was minor considering the.awful experience we just had.  The.only reason why I have.1 star is because it said its required.... Would give -100 stars
B001HX4DNE|5|Expensive
B004FPN4RW|5|Works as a charm! It has been particularly useful up until my daughter was 7 months old. It allowed me to not have to take her out of her car seat if she fell asleep and we had arrived our destination. My wife is very pleased. Only disadvantage is that it won't fit in the carry on compartment of commuter planes, so it is a bit clunky to carry if you are using it on a travel. Very sturdy and resistant.
B0010XTHNW|5|Our 12 month and 2 year old loves these bibs and so do the adults. The little one pulls the bibs that velcro in the back off very quickly. With these pull overs the toddlers can help you put on and take off but they don't come off quickly. The opening does stretch some but is not overly large.
B0031E1GEG|1|While the concept of this cup is great, the amount of times that it leaks and the amount if times I clean up milk off a table, counter, etc. is way to much. Not sure why it leaks or how to fix it, but it is a pain.
B000R2F6CI|5|my child loves it. nice and simple teether. easy for her to hold. cheap price. i used it as a filler so i could get my free shipping
B007700SD0|5|This product is great for protecting babies from germs on carts in shopping malls, groceries stores and even highchairs in restaurants.<br />Everyone comments about it.  There is nothing I dislike about it.  It is used constantly.
B00FOVFB04|5|This was exactly what I was looking for: an unscented body powder that is not gritty. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! I'm not sure why the other reviewer thought it was gritty, it's silky smooth to me.
B001BACLBE|1|This umbrella is unsafe and should not be purchased for two reasons:  1.  It is advertised as being 'universal' and able to fit on all strollers.  It did not attach to my Bugaboo carriage.  The adaptor is not shaped to fit onto a Bugaboo carriage.  I tried to get it to fit, but after bouncing along the sidewalk for a short distance, the umbrella loosened and fell to the ground.  FRUSTRATING AND UNSAFE.    2.  The connector piece that holds the umbrella together is defective.  While bouncing along the sidewalk for a short distance, the top part of the umbrella fell off into the carriage--VERY UNSAFE.    I contacted Babies Gallery (the seller) about the above issues and they suggested--get ready for this--that we attach and hold the umbrella together with duct tape.  Unsafe and unacceptable.    I returned the item, but they refused to refund the shipping and 'restocking' fee, leaving me out $16.00.  An unfair expense, considering the item is not as advertised/defective.  The seller was unhelpful and, quite frankly, rude.    I cannot state enough:  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.
B000GB0NZK|3|December 2012 I Previously rate this a 1:<br />I got this so my 1 year old wouldn't spill his snacks everywhere. he always grabs for the containers and wants to be more independent but spills everything everywhere. within minutes of getting it (didn't even get snacks into it) he figured out how to pull the lid off and thought it was the funnies thing to put it on and pull it off. it will end up being a toy for him and not a snack container. it should screw on or something so he cant get it off & it would be more functional.<br /><br />May 2013 update i upgraded this to a 3:<br />my son is now 16 months old and better understands the purpose of these cups, and that they hold his snack. he is more cooperative with keeping the lid on and pulling his snacks out of the top, but there still are occasional accidents (often in the car with snacks all over my backseat). i still wish that the lid screwed on. i found a playtex version that had a screw on lid, but the top part is not as soft and easy to get the snacks out of it.
B001R2L6PS|1|Pros:    They ARE really soft!!   They are a sustainable material.   They are a good size for a wipe.  They have great \\"tooth\\" for grabbing the poo.    Cons:  Can't dry them in dryer: (But who's gonna separate 30+ small wipes before drying, and risk missing one and ruining it!  Absurd.)    If you do put them in the dryer, they DO unravel.  Trust the reviews.    Air/sun drying them leaves them super stiff.     The corners \\"roll\\" up over time from shrinking.      Personally, I HATE these wipes.  They're useless.  Now they've shrunk so small I can't even use them as cleaning rags.  (They're like 4x4 now!)
B00FWU8N0W|5|Wonderful product
B000H1MRJO|5|Folds up itsy-bitsy, easy to store, light to carry.  Even if some jumping or bouncing happens accidentally (!!) the cot will take it, though no one would recommend that behavior or abuse of product.  My extremely fussy young man took to it immediately and was pleased whenver it was brought out for him this summer.  Cover washed up well, too.  Great price.
B002DWALSY|1|There is nothing to this. A mat and a pillow. Save your money and use a blanket and pillow from home. And it smelled really musty, like an old basement. I returned this the same day I received it. Not worth it.
B002ZO5W8Y|5|This product is worth buying. After searching numerous stores for a bath seat that I could never find, I google it and Amazon supplied me with a list of bath seats. This one caught my eye, because it released in the front to allow me to take my baby out without having to manuever his legs and pull him out. The price was also an eye catcher. I received the product in a timely manner with standard shipping and I have been pleased since receiving it. Thumbs up on this one!
B00020L78M|4|the play yard gate really comes in handy. I use it for my puppies. It cost me half the price at Amazon versus a local department store.
B008Y2DG8O|5|Good size for the kids
B0048SOBGO|5|AWESOME LABELS. I have washed & washed & washed (dishwasher & hand washing) these little suckers, and not a single one has ever peeled, or faded. I've had them for well over a year now. These labels definitely deliver on their promise.
B000YZ8YN6|5|This stroller handles really well and it's light, easy to collapse. We love the adjustable handles. We live in an old, urban neighborhood where the sidewalks are uneven and this stroller handles the bumps fine (wouldn't recommend it for a really fast power-walk, though). A five point harness would be nice, but not necessary.
B004VD29KQ|4|This was a great costume!  Good fit and material.  The costume velcros in the back instead of zipping or buttoning, and that was a little irritating--my son would flex his muscles and it would pop open sometimes.  Other than that, it's a good costume!
B00171WXII|1|This thing sucks (pun intended), the red mouth piece would come off from the tube, making it unusable when you're trying to apply tube to baby's nose.
B00JBYNKUI|5|my baby loves the tub
B007Z8L6RG|5|This bedding set is adorable. The quilt isn't flat  but more like 3D. There are portions that are raised and some that are made with different materials that give this quilt a unique look - almost like a pop- up- book, lol! The diaper stacker works as it should and the wall art makes the room.  The entire set was pre- washed before it went on the bed, including the quilt, and it laundered beautifully.  Truly love this set!
B002RP0S5I|2|I ordered this product for my nursery. The first time it arrived one of the wooden pieces that connects on the bottom was broken in three pieces. I was very disappointed and contacted Amazon, which picked it up the next day. About a week later I received a replacement. This one wasn't broken, but the wood by the top drawer is damaged with multiple gouges taken out of the wood. We really wanted to set this up in the baby room so we're keeping it (my husband said we could spackle over the damage and paint it), but I'm disappointed in the quality. It also doesn't sit flat. Overall disappointed although it is cute.
B00BEVSSUI|5|this is the only kind of cup my granddaughter will use and when I went to Amazon.com and found different ones
B003EUEUVS|5|Our daughter loves this! She is 2 and this gives her so many fun things to point to and name on her own wall. We also spread the non-tree parts of the decal around a bit to extend the effect around her room. It looks lovely, like a child's fantasia.
B007HZBOFG|5|The two year old enjoyed using these today.  He didn't spill his food off the plate like he usually does.  He liked having his food separate. They seem to be well made.
B00278WA4W|5|Finally, I cup that doesn't leak!  Especially while being banged on the table and thrown on the floor by my one-year-old.  Love these sippy cups--nice and big and they really are spill-proof.
B00A7703G2|5|Very soft and fits perfectly in basket
B00BZOF6T0|5|Choosing the right jogging stroller was hard, I changed my mind about three times. I was looking at the Joovy and the Baby Jogger Velocity. I am glad I chose this stroller because of the following:<br />1. It is good looking! I was so concerned about it, it looks really nice and I did not like the photos.<br />2. The suspension is great! And the wheels are giant.<br />3. Baby loves it and ussually falls asleep.<br />4. It is really confortable to have a place for a bottle of wáter and cell phone<br />5. Great canopy<br />The front Wheel issue<br />I run in a curvy road and on weekends I sometimes enjoy a 10k race in which I ussually need to manouver a lot to pass other runners so I dont actually need to fix the front Wheel and I am glad I did not buy a fixed Wheel stroller.<br />Finally, the stroller is to big for my hatchback´s trunk but I put it in the back seat.<br />I love it!
B00483GAJU|4|No complaints. I have to fold them to fit into BumGenius pocket diapers, but that's true of all the brands. I bought this one because it seemed like the best deal at the time, but I also liked the other one I had before it (can't remember the brand, but it was different). All in all, I'd say go for best price, because all these biodegradable diaper liners work. Also... as baby poop gets more and more solid (closer to 1 year old), these become less necessary because the poop will flip right off the diaper easily. BUT, this is nice to have since I can dump the diaper in the pail and just carry this (by its edges) to the bathroom. Also, the poop doesn't leave any marks on the diaper when a liner is in, so that's a plus. This is definitely a nice-to-have product and we'll buy more when we run out, but not 100% necessary.
B005MQR9TM|3|It works well as a child seat and I feel totally confident sticking my kids in them. The main reason I bought these is for the slim design. I have two of these in the back of my 2012 Subaru Outback. This leaves enough space for another person in between the seats and even a third car seat.<br /><br />However, these seats are super heavy and do not have a good way to grip them. The belt are somewhat of a mess and always seems to be flopping around (ok, they initially come nicely packaged and tucked in the back of the chair, but good luck getting them re-tucked in there). The chair also does not stand on it's own, so you always have to lean it against something or lay it down. This makes it really awkward to carry / move them around. For example, it's a huge pain to take them on an airplane.<br /><br />I much prefer the Graco which is bulkier, but so much easier otherwise.
B001V8TBR8|5|Okay, I've written a bunch of reviews for other Rover Gear products, but I feel I have to...we wasted so much money on other products and I have to spread the word!  We were so tired of having our car seats come back to us in poor condition after flights.  Up until the age of 3 we brought our car seat with us on the plane, we still used a cover to get it through the airport, but after a fiasco with one I was so frustrated!  (Long story short, after we arrived at our lay over destination, I was trying to fit the car seat back into the bag and wasn't able to.  I had to ask 2 flight attendants to help me and I just gave up.  I was the last one off the plane and almost missed my connection [a lot of fun running through 3 terminals at DFW carrying a 2 year old and a car seat ]  Anyway, we put up with mediocre products and when we saw this one we hoped it would be better.  Wow!  It was, no more tears, no more forcing the car seat into the bag, just voila it's done and with the added piece of mind that you know you'll get your car seat back in the original condition that you checked it.  Don't bother on the flimsy products out their.  This brand is in a league of it's own!
B000LECMFQ|5|Great set for the price!  Only thing that might have helped is longer bumper pad ties (I have a big deluxe crib, so it didn't go all the way around the corners).
B004B9HDU6|2|Super cute, but out of the dozen ducks I received, 6 were dirty,  grease strained it appears.
B00H8MQ7XC|3|It's okay.  I would probably return it if I could and use the money for a different stroller.
B00FBPFEN2|5|My husband is always complaining that he can't find things in the diaper bag. Now he doesn't have an excuse! :) Works great!
B00CZE7T1M|5|The bag is spacious but not as big as you would think( I like this because I have the open mouth Jeep diaper bag and it's HUGE without proper pockets). This has allot of pockets and space without being huge or a hinderance to carry. It's super cute!
B009A7VTYA|5|These are so nice to change a baby on.  Our toddler hated having his diaper changed and would cry and protest.  When we got this for our newborn, our 18 month old wanted to be changed on this too-- and doesnt protest anymore.  We do have it on the floor in our playroom and it works great. I wish I had had this from the beginning with the first baby.
B0038W0JJ4|3|We had a Britax convertible carseat for my son, which was great. And since I am a big fan of the brand, I bought this when he outgrew the convertible (at about age 3 and a half). I'm not impressed. The straps on this booster are the bane of my existence -- they are constantly twisted up, and it's very difficult to adjust. The arm rests are really high, so it's kind of difficult for my son (he's 4) to get in and out of the carseat on his own (I have a Volvo wagon). Overall, I wish we'd gone with a Graco model -- clasps are much easier to use, and they're cheaper.
B000T5PMZ4|5|Daughter's husband loves this pillow.
B004MPQ7B0|5|I use this bag for everything! Purse, diaper bag.. It's wonderful! So light weight and easy to carry. I love that you tie the straps different ways to fit you needs. Overall, it's just wonderful. I would buy another in a heartbeat! Actually.. All ju ju be's products are fabulous!
B0067GKHVS|5|This is certainly not a necessity, but it definitely makes diaper changes easier. Whenever I change diapers with one of those plastic dispensers that come with the wipes, and it lifts off the changing table as a I shake loose a wipe, I'm grateful that I have this at home. It doesn't work well with Huggies wipes, however, which tend to rip. Switching to Pampers wipes works just fine.
B006JW9P9U|4|This seat is really comfortable, sturdy and fold able! The material and plastic are high quality; the seat is really cushioned. The seat is also just the right size for any car. I have a Forrester and fits right but my husband has a four-seater sports car and it fits really well as well. You can also tell that the thought that went into the safety of this seat is high quality because of the materials and the way that it seamlessly fits in the cars. Also the cup holders are a plus but most sippy cups do not fit as they are too wide. It is ok since the cup holders can be retracted. I have a Graco high seat booster in the other car and it is flimsy when you take it out and bulky. I'm glad that this is seat that I use 95% of the time to keep my child safe in my car. Also, the fold able option is great and functional when you have to take it out or when the child is not in the car and you need to maximize space in your car. Great seat!
B00F9QTWCM|2|they are too big for a  baby. they should  only be for babies who can't walk yet.  they are so big that by the time the baby can wear them, they might as well wear shoes
B00A4K8FX0|5|My husband and I are incredibly pleased with this monitor. The picture is extremely clear both day and night, sound features are top notch and range is very good throughout our home. The camera was easy to mount, as my husband built a piece for over our crib to attach it to, and the pan/tilt/zoom is easy to use and provides a full look at our little one's nursery. I can live with the start up jingle when all other features are so great. Definitely recommend.
B0070ORE2Q|5|I almost returned these until we figured out how to assemble these properly. The rubber plug at the end of the straw piece must be completely pushed through the white plastic receiver, otherwise they will leak or your child can't get liquid through the straw.  BEST cups ever!!  My son has had his for almost a year and I just bought him a couple more.  I recommend them to anyone that has children that like straw cups!!  ONLY ones that I have found that won't leak!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
B002GEJYSM|2|I purchased this because i love the bottle..even tho i read another review saying a big CON for this bottle is that you can't see the measurements.  Which is totally true.  I poured milk in there and had to pour it back out to see if i got the measurement right. Two stars because it serves its purpose for me..i use it primarily to warm up milk and the bottle itself is not bad.
B00A67C57S|5|Just what I was looking for to protect my grandbaby.
B004XSJO0M|5|we purchased two last year.  the quality is great and the kids sleep well.  substantial design and easy to inflate.
B000ZA5X2K|1|Target does not have this in stock as indicated.  I order one since the first week of Dec 07 and still no seat.  Called them up and they said the item can  take up to 6 weeks
B004K6QKMW|3|As a new mom I was super super excited to buy everything for our princess and didn't really mind the price as long as it was the &#34;best&#34;. Although this chair supposedly can be used for a newborn, I really can't imagine it as its big and the new born might not be very secure in it. I started using this when my daughter was 6 months old (she is quite a large baby though and at 6 months was wearing clothes for a year old).<br />The seat is very well made, and I loved how high she used to ride when she was younger. Now that she's 2 and much bigger that has become a bit of an issue as she has almost outgrown this seat. The &#34;high ride&#34; is also a disadvantage now as she sometimes seems too high up the car. I'm not expressing myself very well here so I apologize for that.<br />It is also not very easy to move this seats when we change  cars which resulted in me buying another car seat (Britax frontier) which was half the price of this but seems to be easier to handle, has more practical accessories like a cup holder and seems to be wider and more comfortable.<br />I guess I was happy with this seat until we purchased the other car seat and me (as well as my daughter) saw the differences and realized that the designer seat may be pretty but the other seat just suited our needs more.<br />I also made the mistake of throwing in all the covers including the foam inserts in the washer and boy what a mistake that was. We do not have a dryer ( we live in the philippines where laundry is dried outdoors) and it took forever for it to dry , despite the pounding heat outside. the insert foam started to smell funky as the water on the inside wouldn't get dry and we had to do some mcgyver moves to have it dried.<br />The seat is good, I just realize now that we can have spent half of what we did and have gotten the same thing or even more.
B003KEMMNG|5|Perfect
B0007YDCKY|4|Nice size, and comfortable. Somewhat of a pain to fold up correctly and put back into the outside carrying holder. Other than that, it is a good product!
B00GR9FHNI|5|Excellent quality. Easy to install and it sticks on wood and metal no problem. My kid is unable to break it so far.
B002BSGWT2|2|These are to small to swaddel in .  They are more like thin over sized burb rags.  They are cute and soft, but little.
B0032G9E0G|5|A convenient way to dry your baby bottles.
B0009OLSZ8|5|This is a great potty chair. I had a Safety 1st potty chair/step stool combo chair that didn't work out because my son likes to dump the potty by himself and in order to do that he had to lift the chair apart and then pull out the bowl. It was always messy. This chair is wonderful in that the bowl fits nicely on top of the seat so he just lifts it straight up and out and is able to dump it easily. With the Safety 1st model and others, there are lots of spots and crevices under the bowl where the spills get caught. This Bjorn potty chair is simply constructed so it is easy to clean.
B000K53UEI|5|Love it
B001ENY02G|5|We bought this stand to use with our uppababy bassinet, and it is great.  It was easy to assemble and looks really nice.  The bassinet fits nicely in the stand with a little room, but it doesn't slide around or anything.  We have been using it for almost 3 months and I am very satisfied with it.  Definitely worth it.
B000MRLYMY|5|My baby is happy.She is comfortable with her new nipples.I recommend this product pretty much，Price is also good . a
B00IQFFPFQ|4|I just received this and haven't washed it yet.  However it is Very adorable. The weight is good and the blanket is a good weight and very soft.  My 2 year old just loved it.
B002B55AAW|5|We bought this bib when we started my daughter on solids back in 2011. We still use it with especially messy meals and it still catches *almost* everything! I love that I can just wipe it off and put it in the diaper bag after a meal at a restaurant (no icky cloth bibs bunched in the bottom of the bag). It is literally the only bib that we have used with my daughter for over a year. It is very sturdy and shows no wear after all that use. Tomato sauce can temporarily stain it, but after a few hand washes even those stains fade. I have friends who have bought other brands of similar bibs but the plastic is thinner and more flimsy and just doesn't seem to hold up. We're expecting our second and when we found out boy or girl I will be ordering another one of these bibs! I cannot recommend this bib highly enough!
B003OQTPFS|5|We got our Woombie when our daughter was 5 months and she used it for 4 months at night.  It was wonderful.  Such a gentle and easy way to swaddle her.  I loved the dual end zipper that made for easy night time diaper changes.  I am a little sad that she has outgrown it but will recommend it to others who are expecting.
B00CFGSO3M|1|I am very disappointed with this tub. It looks cool and the fact that it folds up is nice. But it is so slippery! My infant couldn't be washed in it because she would wriggle around and end up sliding down and out of it, even with me holding on to her arm. Now that she's bigger and sitting upright in it she still slips and slides around too much for me to really use it. Again, even though I've got ahold of her arm, she makes even a small move and she ends up at a weird angle or dunking her face in. I totally regret throwing out our $20 whale tub in favor of this one. If I could return it I would!
B007NG5UEU|1|We purchased this so that we could have monitors on multiple levels of our two-story house. The monitor worked great for the first seven months. Then last night, all of the sudden both &#34;parent units&#34; no longer connect to the &#34;baby unit.&#34; Despite my best efforts, the &#34;parent units&#34; just say &#34;Not Linked.&#34; Looking at other reviews, this seems to be a similar occurrence after a while.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be able to RMA this because we didn't keep the original packaging :(
B0035Z79Z6|5|Its very cheap and sad looking but my son loved it and thats all that matters.
B00D8W51YW|5|Kids love the taste
B009ICN71K|5|I will be honest this was a &#34;I need to reach $35 to get free shipping&#34; add on buy. I figured it wouldn't hurt to have and I really didn't want to pay shipping for my Amazon order so into the cart this went & I am SO glad it did. My son LOVES this.The little rabbit ear looking part crinkles like paper; there is a soft squishy green chewy part; and a red and yellow harder chewy parts. My son has 3 new teeth coming in (he is almost 6 months and already has 2 teeth) so when his little teeth start to hurt and he doesn't want any of his cold teethers this pacifies him. I am SO glad I got this.
B000YDP256|4|This was not the potty I wanted because of the reviews I read, but it was given to me as a gift so we took it and have definitely used it! At 16 months, my daughter needed some lifting to get her positioned right. By age 2 she's doing OK.  She always has a red ring on her tushy when she gets up. The cushioned seat is nice, but does stain, and clorox wipes don't help. The lid is big so when open, it takes up more room. My daughter has also fallen back on it and it hurts (we have it against a wall...well, as much as the lid will allow). We ended up taking the lid off because of that, so if you get it, I wouldn't put it on unless you travel or need it as a step stool.  Others are right in that the urine will go down under the cushion and I agree that it doesn't dump very easily (I try to always dump it from the same side so my hands are less likely to get gross). It does the job though & works as a nice step stool for my daughter to help me put laundry in our washer.
B000YDDF6O|5|good
B000YHD4TI|3|This a great looking stroller, easy to assemble and light in weight. A few things that might not be everybody's problem took the shine off for us a bit: 1) it's difficult to fold and put into the car. 2) Our Michigan winters caused the screws on the front wheels to rust very quickly. (but as the makers assured me, this will be dealt with immediately). 3) Our baby daughter (14 months) took a bite out of the foam covered bumper bar.    One thing I must stress, though: with all these complaints, Uppa Baby dealt with immediately and with the utmost concern and friendliness. Wheels got exchanged immediately. Our theory is that being such a new stroller, the Vista has a few birth marks which Uppa Baby are treating.    Overall three stars because it rolls nicely, the rubber wheels are soft and big and it has a large storage compartment. It looks very cool and we like that we can turn the seat round even with the baby in it. Still, two stars off for the rusty screws and the Yummy frame piece.
B004323NIC|5|although i bought this for my son, he never used it, he went for his thumb instead. But i gave it to my sister and she has washed it plenty of times and it still looks brand new.
B001IYD6VM|2|I've used this once and I will do whatever I can to avoid using it again. At a recent festival, the bugs were unavoidable and in an attempt to protect baby, we opened the netting and securely wrapped it over our umbrella stroller. Immediately we noticed the netting had a chemical-like smell and needed to air it out before using it. Once over the stroller, it wasn't long before our 6 month old had hold of the netting and was trying to put it into his mouth. No matter how we secured the net, it always managed to get loose and cause more of a hazard.
B001IYD6VM|4|You can ou this on pretty much any stroller, it is nice and big.  The netting could stand to be tighter to keep out noseeums like we have in florida but overall great for the price.
B00BNT0Y94|5|I love them
B005OI8O88|5|by poor teething baby loves these they dont need to be cold either he just loves them very worth it
B00N1OO6C0|5|I like it.
B000VBGT3K|5|Use these to give baby medicine. Mix breast milk with her medicine and she gobbles it up. Muuuuuch better than using a syringe!!!!
B001OC5UMQ|4|Works well.  Frame can bend if child pulls on it enough.  Still . . . it serves its purpose
B00NFIZ0OK|3|Stickers are good. It includes milestone sticjers as well.but the down point is stickers finish i<br />s not glossy and looks dull
B00D0F4WEW|4|My 9-month old granddaughter loves the WubbaNub lion.  If the lion's mane was a little larger, I would have given it a 5.  She has two other WubbaNubs and loves all of them.
B00RICPWJC|4|☺️
B0092YYDQW|4|Baby loves it. He's almost learned to pull it on his own.
B001I459AS|5|Just what I was looking for ...
B006NTY1HU|5|The pups love it very well constructed.
B0034G5UZC|5|Great thanks!
B00483GAJU|3|These liners are ok for what they are. They definitely get the job done, but they are not nearly as soft as some of the other liners we've tried. They're also stiffer, which contributes to the un-soft-ness. They're about the size of other brands' &#34;large.&#34;<br /><br />I know they say &#34;flushable&#34; but you really shouldn't put anything except toilet paper in the toilet (according to our plumber) so flush at your own risk (but this is the same for all &#34;flushable&#34; liners).
B003GSLDBS|5|Incredibly wonderful. This is the second one i purchased as a gift for a toddler. My grandniece wouldn't let go of it. It was a very popular present. Beautifully made. Would buy more.
B002WD9J96|5|Our Boppy came with us to the hospital and everyone who held the new baby used this as an arm prop. However, no one appreciated it more than me (a first time mom learning to Breastfeed baby). It helps hold your arm up during those exhausting early morning feedings so you can focus on positioning baby. We've let baby sit in it a few times and can't wait to watch her grow into it!
B004H6A1OI|1|This product is not a bassinet, it is not a blanket or pillow. It is a washcloth sized &#34;blanket&#34; with what cannot be described as a pillow. I have never been so disappointed or mistreated  by an online order. The supervisor lied to me several times about solutions to resolve the issue of the false advertisement and ended our conversation with no suitable solution. Do not order from this company, you will be highly dissatisfied and irritated!!!!
B007A2ZSZ8|5|I use these everywhere. On the fridge. On our front door and inside garage door. Kids can't get them open, the normal way or by force. Very nice.
B004V8VQC8|5|Great buy! Our son loved it.  He is now a yr old and still bangs on the piano.  Money well spent.
B007FRJQ5G|5|I ordered this mattress for my Stanley Young America BTG crib and it fits perfectly. The price and quality for a 2 for 1 is great! Also, shipping was fast. I ordered on a Saturday night and the mattress arrived the following Tuesday night.
B0035JL93A|3|These were the only thing I could find that were vinyl. They are good, until a few washes, then they tear at the seams and are pointless to put on the baby, because he'll pee right through them.
B000CSBP3G|4|This is a great bib for little ones that are learning to self feed.  Makes clean-up so much easier.  I actually got it at Target for $3.99 for one.  Only thing I didn't prefer is how stiff it is and my litle guy doesn't like to wear it, but deals with it (most of the time).
B00EFQXCM8|5|We got this as a gift for our almost one year old late last year. This our baby's favorite toy.
B004K195JW|4|Love the crib its very nice wood, however soft (easily scratched). It will be a great bed for years for our little one. ONE problem, it is not advertised that you must buy the rails to make it into a twin/full size bed separately. That would have been nice to know. By the time that we use this for a twin bed those items might be impossible if not very difficult to find. Sneaky false advertising.....I think.
B00881G426|5|Our granddaughter visits us quite often, so we were looking for a crib for nap times and overnights to replace the pack and play we had been using.  The crib was easy to assemble and looks so nice in our spare room.  Our granddaughter is 16 months old, so we set the mattress at the lowest setting.  I am sure it will be very easy to convert to a toddler bed when the time comes.  The price was just right and we are very happy with the purchase!
B00009VE5J|5|I bought this for my son when he was little, it fits over all shopping carts, and any high chair.  If you are a mom, invest in this, it will save your child from alot of germs, just think what is on those high chairs and grocery carts......yuck!!  I have bought this for everyone I know that is having a baby, and I always get asked where to get one.  Note: Don't buy the one in the stores that just cover the front and back of the cart, your baby still touches the sides. <br /> <br />katie, tampa, fl
B00D04R3LM|4|Great seat, only compliant is the arm rests don't fold down for the kids to get in and out as easily.  Also, it's hard to adjust the pull down straps, the area to get your finger in and push down the button is really deep and I have little fingers.
B0011E5LXK|1|I own both the medela pump in style with backpack and ameda's purely yours pump. Ameda's pump is better than medela. See below. I don't use my medela pump at all despite having wasted about $300 on pump and spare parts.     I am a working mom so I pumped a lot with baby #1 and am doing same with baby #2 - already have a freezer full of milk.     Why ameda is superior to medela:   1) NO MOLD growth - milk cannot get into tubes. See below. After I found mold on my medela pump I went out and bought an ameda pump right away.   2) about half the price as medela if you just buy the pump and not the bag etc.   3) the ameda pump is easily freestanding, also has nice slots on the pump to hold your pumped milk in bottles.   If you remove the medela pump from the backpack or bag you'll see the pump casing - the medela pump has holes in the casing around the pump so you don't really want to take it out of the bag - and nowhere to put your pumped bottles so they don't fall over.     FYI Ameda pump has lasted since 2008 with pumping daily 5 days/week (I breastfed baby #1 for 18 months) and it is still going great - I'm using it again now.       Medela knows about the milk in the tubes problem - in fact there are instructions about this in the booklet that comes with their pump. Well, I got milk backed up in the tubes more than once despite following the instructions in the manual. Then I had to stop pumping and dry the tubes out. No more pumping that day as I did not have spare tubes. And, to my horror, despite running the MEDELA pump for a couple of minutes after every pumping as per instructions, and drying out the tubes if they got milk in them, I opened the faceplate of the medela pump one day and found MOLD growing on my medela pump. That was it, I bought an ameda pump and have never gone back.
B008YSMKBC|4|This diaper works well for my baby. It doesn't have as much absorbency as other fitted diapers and could use a few more snaps for better sizing. It does work really well for an overnight diaper. However, I didnt get the cute diaper in the picture, I got one with brown stitching. I was bummed about that.
B0091E31KM|5|Really only use this on one setting right now... &#34;white noise.&#34; But we loved it so much, we bought a second one for another room for my 11-month-old. So so simple. They didn't try to complicate this product.
B00M2UA09W|1|these are adorable, but not useful in our set up.
B0029Z9UWS|3|I don't know if there's a standard crib size or not, but this one didn't fit the crib that I purchased--which was the babyletto Mercer 3-in-1 Convertible Crib. It was one side too short. But besides that the material was very nice and soft and there was enough cushion in the bumper.
B007BZ5CVY|5|Wish this was around when our children were preschoolers.  Will order more
B001V9EVCM|5|My baby nursed until he was 4 months and when it was time for me to go back for work I started pumping breast milk for him. He took this bottles with no problems, although he was surprised his milk came this way :) but he moved from bottles to nursing with no problems. The nipple in this set is medium flow but i use a slow flow from another set so he has to work on this like with nursing which is very important.<br />I've only received one cap in mine but i think there should be three caps. Also, the bottles don't look exactly like the pictures. The line for the measurements is straight which I prefer, makes it easier to see how much is in the bottle.<br />These bottles work with my pump in style Medela pump and all the caps work with the 5 oz. bottles as well.
B0076LAGQ4|5|I purchased the Munchkin 3 Piece Silly Sandwich Cutter Set because I love to do a lot of bento lunches for my 3.5 year old son who is in preschool. He loves these sandwich cutters just as much as I do. His favorite is the jigsaw puzzle pieces. These are durable, easy to use, well made and a great deal. I always recommend them to everyone who asks about my sons lunches!
B004CJ9D6W|1|My issue is not with the product as much as with the customer service.<br /><br />First thing first, regarding the product, it is a good product (not great), and althought it broke down for us, was very functional and helpful during the time it operated. The only real negative is the inability to turn the video off and keep the audio on, which we wanted to do occasionally.<br /><br />Regarding the customer service, it is the worst i have seen. I dont have the energy to explain all the problems, but you need to take my word for it. They will exhaust you and make it very difficult to get in touch with them. You have to wait on the phone for a good 25-40 minutes before anyone picks up. They WILL pick up the phone, but you have to be persistent and stay on the line. Do not listen to the prompt that suggests you send an email....you will likely never hear back.<br /><br />Once they have answered the phone, be clear about whatever decision you make on the phone regarding warranty replacements, etc. Long story short, they did not complete the repair I was under the impression they were conducting. Make them be explicit, and be sure to be clear about your expectations.<br /><br />This whole thing is one big headache. Buy another monitor, not because the product is bad, but because the people are incompetent.
B0029ZMRWI|4|Sheet fits in our Graco Pack n' Play. It's not as soft as I would've hoped for organic jersey cotton, but at least it's made in the USA.
B002JP7USY|5|This bag is perfect. I use it for my 21 month old for when he goes to Grandmothers house plus we use it around town. I get more people telling me they love the monkey. Oh p,us my son can carry it himself. Great size great color.
B007IERGC6|1|I don't like it at all..the clip it's so so hard to open..it's also way too wide.. other brands worked much better
B00KUM3MAS|5|Love this valence, went great with the elephant bedding for my son's nursery
B000BZ6BAM|5|We got our Maclaren stroller a few weeks ago.  We love it.  My husband and I are both tall ~ me 5'7\\" and him 6'1\\".  Both of us can use this stroller without slouching or kicking the wheels when we walk.  The stroller folds and unfolds easily and maneuvers beautifully. I highly recommend this stroller to anyone who is taller and wants a convenient stroller. <br />
B00171WXII|5|I had heard these were amazing but I just never got one till my son was 9 months and had the worst cold and congestion. The bulb was not cutting it. He is normally pretty calm about sucking his nose out but after having to do it so often with the cold, he started hating it. I felt that if I had to hold him down to get his boogers out, it better be getting them out every time, and this one does that. It got EVERYTHING, my husband was even impressed. I had a happy baby after that. After a few months he has even let me get him use to it enough where I don't have to hold him down to do it, he just sits there and lets me suck them out. Perfect!
B002GWVZCW|4|I have to respectfully disagree with everyone who stated this bed was hard to build.  My husband wasn't home so I put it together when it arrived.  Directions were clear enough and it assembled easily.  The only thing I could note is that in the directions the parts were labeled by letter and the parts themselves did not have the corresponding letter on them. However, there aren't that many parts and it is easy enough to figure out what is what. I did not have any issue with parts being damaged or not fitting correctly.  The trickiest part was getting all of the slats in and to stay in while I tightened it. However, I was able to do so without help.  The bed is very cute and appears sturdy.
B0009OLSY4|5|I love that the entire top of the stool is rubber as well as the bottom.  This keeps the stool from being slippery when water is dripped everwhere when our little one is washing his hands.
B000MAER16|5|We bought this for our son who is due in February. Being as impatient as we are, we went ahead and set it up. It's absolutely adorable. The fabric isn't rough, and it is very sturdy. The only thing that gave us problems was the changing table. The picture in the directions is a little problematic, but thru perseverance and Google I managed to get it installed correctly! I can't wait to use it!
B00B2F7YSS|5|These were the perfect favor for my parents 50th wedding anniversary party!
B0033B9CZ2|4|They work fine!!
B000YZAZMO|4|My parents brought this for my son.  My wife and I probably screwed up by introducing it too early.  He's 9 months old and is a little bored with it.  However, he loves pulling himself up next to it an playing with the toys. When he loved it, it was a tremendous life saver because you good get your chores done while he played.    This is very well made and easy to put together.  It takes a lot of batteries, but surprisingly it doesn't eat them up quickly.  My physical and occupational therapy friends swear by this toy - not necessarily this model.    You could probably save a few bucks with their less expensive model.  If the price is not an issue, but this one.
B0070ZY80Q|1|I did not like these at all.  The clasps are extremely narrow and virtually impossible to clip onto anything thicker than 3 sheets of paper.
B001OC5UNK|3|We've had this up for 4 or 5 months now.  We use it as a pet gate, keeping our little doggies in the kitchen.    This is a budget gate that holds up pretty well, but has some issues:  1) our opening was about 47 inches.  At that width, there are huge gaps in the side that our dogs would have had no problem jumping through.  There's another insert that can be put in at about 49 inches, which would have been perfect.  But it woudn't fit at 48.  I took the widest insert outside and used an angle grinder to take off one rung, shortening it by 2-3 inches.  Then the other insert would also fit and everything was tight enough on the sides that our doggies are safely kept in the kitchen.  2) There's a bottom brace, and you will probably trip on it.  This isn't a big deal, but it sometimes bends the gate a bit at the joints between the gate and extenders.  You can bend it back, but it's a bit of an annoyance.  3) Too secure, and you won't be able to open the gate.  The way the locking mechanism works, if the gate is too tight, it won't open.  Too loose, and it won't lock shut.  It will take some fiddling to find the right tightness that will keep the gate in place, while still allowing you top open or close it.  4) Not self-closing.    What we were going for was a gate that would keep our doggies in the kitchen while we are away.  It works for that.  I would probably go for something more secure if it was to be used as a safety gate - like at the top of a staircase, for example.
B008PWZ29Y|5|This mobile has been hanging over the baby's crib for several months and she has enjoyed watching it move or being held so she can grab the dragonflies.  At the age of almost 1 year, the baby has begun waking up in the morning, standing up in the crib, pointing at the dragonflies, and making excited noises.  It is gratifying to get that kind of feedback from the baby!
B00OOLTJ0I|4|Took forever to be delivered, but it's understandable since it's shipped from the other side of the world. I love it! But, the text print came out so blurry! the elephant is printed out clearly though. Other than that I am satisfied with the product.
B009UQPSE8|5|Adds enough light at night
B002A9JCY4|1|not working
B004IEBSXM|5|I use these for my 8 month old son who is a heavy wetter and belly sleeper.  His Smartipants pocket diapers (double stuffed) were leaking every single night.  I got these with the Thirsties covers for Christmas and have not had any leaks yet!  He just wears them overnight.  I have not needed to stuff them, as the diaper itself is quite thick and absorbent.  He wakes up with a soaked diaper, but his pajamas are clean and dry.  The diaper cover has elastic on the legs, back and front to prevent leaks from all angles.  I was concerned that he would get diaper rash from having the wet material on his skin all night, but that has not happened at all.  The only drawback is they take forever to dry.  I put them in the dryer with my other diapers, then air dry for several hours to finish.  Not a big deal, considering I only have a few of this kind in my rotation.
B002WB2G9I|5|great stroller! Purchased for traveling in an airport with my 6 month old. She loved it! Now we take it everywhere!
B002MVYD1M|2|Not what I expected :(
B0073GD1LY|5|This little monkey was bought for my granddaughter, Braelyn, who was very pleased when she opened it. I was happy for her.
B004JU0H6O|5|This is a must have for a pack & play/playard if your child sleeps in it.  The mattress is water proof on all sides now.  I previously bought the same mattress and it was only water proof on one side.  I am very pleased with the improvement.  Had the first one that I purchased been waterproof on all sides, I would not have had to invest in a second one.  I use this in my son's Chicco Luna pack & play and it fits great.  There are small gaps in the corner's where his pacifier sometimes falls, but other than that there are no issues with the way that it fits.
B005RCM5YU|5|I shopped all over for a glider for my nursery. This is my second child and with the first. I had bought a rocker/glider that was part wood and part fabric (FYI - I liked that glider for about the first six months, and then it would creak and, eventually, the arms started to fall apart.) This Rockabye Glider is not only beautiful, but sooo comfortable that I (5' 3&#34;) and my husband (6' 3&#34;) have fallen asleep in it (while trying to get our almost 3 yr old to sleep). I have read reviews about squeaks, but our glider is whisper quiet. The only downside is that the chair is a bit large and difficult to get through door frames.
B00G80HVTY|5|The volume is rather loud even while at the lowest setting. That being said, reception between the monitor and camera is great, the ability to turn off the video feed and keep the audio is a nice feature, battery life has not once been an issue, and the mic/speaker works very well. Overall, very pleased with the product.
B0010WAXN6|5|I've had this chair for almost 2 years and we are still using it.  My son is 2 years old and is still using it.  The reclyining option was great for when he was little and just using a bottle.  I don't have anything to compare it to, except for a normal high chair which takes up space.  This chair uses one of your own kitchen chairs and we've brought it to friends houses for dinner, so it adjusts to any chair.  It has never fallen apart or broken even though my son now pulls himself up and even stands on it.  This chair has been very sturdy.  We now just use it as a booster seat, but I'm thinking of buying a new one for the new baby.
B00AJSJCBG|5|She really enjoys the bounce
B00AR2B5X2|2|i brought this last winter for my baby girl and it would not stay on my carseat,it would not fit all the way around the carseat and when i did finally get it on i would have to keep tugging at it to keep it secure i think i got mines from Walmart but i was told it fit all carseats that's a lie it's a piece of junk,ur baby will freeze because u will keep having to stop to secure it on the carseat,really a waste of money
B005VMJO7C|4|worked until I was 5 months then it just started to flatten out
B002J4U8M0|5|He loves to look at himself in the mirror, and the other side has a place to put a picture, so I can put pictures of him, family members, and sometimes just pics I take from magazines. I like to change it up and he has fun with both sides of this toy. I agree with some other reviewers that it does not sit up well on its own if it is pushed over. But if your baby doesn't knock it over it stays up.
B000056C86|5|As a daycare provider, I own a lot of play yards. By far Graco is the best manufacturer of quality play yards!  I own the very first pack n play that Graco made...and I still use it every day.  It's as good as new and I bought it over fourteen years ago!<br />I just added this larger model to my inventory...and I am very pleased with it.  It is more spacious than the standard models and easily accommodates toddlers.  The toys are entertaining for the younger folks.  (although since I use these beds for naps, I would prefer no toys)<br />I know some people find the pack n plays difficult to fold and unfold, but I don't find that to be true.  It just takes a bit of practise and once you get the hang of it..this bed takes seconds to put up or put away.<br />I highly reccommend this item.
B0054TB3ZI|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE this bedding set!!! I was shopping around for months trying to find a bedding set for my baby's nursery! So happy I bought it here because it includes EVERYTHING you need. Other stores and online sellers offered this set but it would not be a full set like this one, and the price is very reasonable too! I fell in love with this set the second I found it and couldn't wait to buy it. I bought the matching mobile to complete the nursery. I have white furniture for my baby and this set looks stunning!!! The fabric is of good quality and air dries very quickly.
B00IKPUGMO|2|The frame is cute, however, the slots for the pictures are so tiny! The best I could find was wallet size pictures and they needed to be cut to fit. I would not recommend this frame unless you have lots of patience and time!
B001R44CQQ|5|I bought this spout cover when my daughter was born, it just got a hole in it and would not keep the air, please note, my daughter is 4!  For the price, this item lasted a long time.  It fit my bathtub spout (which has a knob to pull up for the shower) perfectly and never grew mold.  It is very soft and cushy and my daughter has bumped herself on it before and was perfectly fine.  It is a great item, just note that the picture is of a froggy design, but I got an ocean design instead.  It doesn't match my bathroom motif, but makes the spout safe.
B00Z15B7C4|5|First diaper system I purchased and my favorite so far! The covers are cute and stretchy and not one blowout! I got the stay dry inserts first bc they were cheaper but just ordered hemp today and cannot wait to try them as hemp is much more absorbent. I have twin girls and one is a heavier wetter so I use a stay dry insert and a hemp doubler with her, whereas the other twin can use just the stay dry and have no leaks. Overall love love love them! Well constructed and worth the initial cost! I highly recommend these!
B00DJPK8PA|5|Great product, I love the fact that the balls are soft and squishy - my son loves chewing on them!
B00PNXHW46|2|The trays don't fit. they are supposed to glide and open but i can't even get them into the notch where they are supposed  to go. Also to change the height is near impossible, so my baby girl can' touch the floor. I am contemplating returning this walker. I also don't like the back wheels I find they make mobility a lot harder.
B00005QIZX|1|Registered for this because of the light show.  While that is a great concept, it is so staticky!  There are constant noises all night, and it has woken my baby up.  I can barely hear her if she wakes up in the middle of the night.
B004OR1DOM|2|I bought these for our twins (one of each color) and was very sad. It works wonderfully but the blue one fell apart within 2 months of minimal use, as our boys are simply getting used to sitting on the potty. The back fell off and no matter how we tried to glue it, no glue held, so now the lid just sits on it and is not attached. The pieces constantly pop apart and we have to put them back together, including the seat. The splash guard is also not the best for boys;). All of this being said I'm still really trying to like the one that hasn't fallen to pieces(literally). But I will be replacing the potty and not with another boon one :(
B004M14JQO|5|Just what I needed
B002GPVER0|5|love the nosefrida
B001ARYDFA|5|This toy is actually cooler than I thought it would be.  It will only light up when in the water which is awesome.  It has sensors on its belly to detect when it is in the water.  The second you lift it out of water the light goes off.  The light changes several different colors and the goldfish is actually really large!  My son is 5 and loves his baths and this is one of his favorite toys to bring in there.  We have been using it for about 3 months now and the lights are still going strong.  Overall a great purchase for a low price!
B00BLVQIMG|4|tube like and easy.  I haven't had it for too long but I like that it keeps the smell down.....
B00069BV8A|5|I am so glad I found this for my three year old daughter.  It is so quick and easy to put together and use .  I have even had my daughter use it while trying on clothes in a dressing room ( no mess to clean up)  all you do is tie the bag and drop it in the nearest trash can. We have used it in the back of iur SUV and car because we all know how nasty some public restrooms can be.  I hate using them let alone have my three year old touching everything in site.  If you dont have this product already GET ONE!!! You wont regret it.
B000M4DC9A|4|Good product but it would be great if there were extra clips included because several of the clips break easily and are not good for toddlers.  OK if adults are using it but too delicate for toddlers.
B000068FAY|5|I just received this item that I ordered from Target last week. According to other reviews people have said it was difficult to assemble. Well, my husband had no problem. The instructions are very clear and it took him about 45 minutes to put it together. I do agree with the other reviews, it is MUCH bigger than it looks in the picture. I thought I'd never find a &amp;quot;kid-friendly&amp;quot; bookcase to hold ALL my daughters' books of ALL sizes. Definitely worth the money and a wise investment. When my girls get a little older, this is the perfect dollhouse for them. I hope you are convinced by my review that this is a very high quality item, and you'll be pleased!!
B001CFFX90|3|We have a very small stall shower so having this is helpful when shaving. We have basic tile and it does stick and stay up but it will come off sometimes, probably every few months. It goes on the wall very easily so it's not a bid deal to stick it back up. It also seems to support the weight of my leg with no problems. I do wish it would stay up more permanently but it works for me since I have no room in my shower for a stool.
B007NG5UEU|2|I bought this product after reading many good reviews.  I was initially very pleased with its performance.  It linked up right out of the box, was very quiet unlike my old Sony Baby Call which pops and cracks like crazy.  But this evening I went to move the baby unit from one spot in by daughters room to another.  The link was lost between the baby and parents units.  I have followed all &#34;suggested&#34; methods to restore the link in the manual and have been unsuccessful.  I would have to say that I am not satisfied with my purchase.  It shouldn't fail this soon after buying it.
B0031ARQLC|4|Nice and very solid, can hold me and my daughters weight, which is nice since most toddlers need help to learn to sleep alone..
B000GE1MEI|1|This product is horrible. My 1 year old son broke it in 1 minute!!
B00BXE67VS|3|Kind of complicated getting the bags in, and they are very expensive to replace. (Tip: Target sells imitation diaper genie refills for like 1/4 the price!). I don't find it to be very sanitary, either. Sometimes it grosses me out to push the diapers through the little slot, since I know the plastic has poop and pee on it.
B001OC5UMQ|5|This gate is easy to use and has been perfect for keeping the new puppy restricted to certain areas of my house.  I like the fact that it is not permanently attached to anything, and the price was really good too.
B00H9Y8BGU|5|My daughter loves little &#34;Joey&#34;, as we call him. I think because he is small and she can manipulate him with her tiny hands. People make jokes about the toy bc it's a little odd looking with the pocket for the joey. But she loves it - that's what matters! I was able to wash this on delicate and didn't dry it.
B00JLIWAY6|5|Fast delivery and a really adorable product. I am certain my friend and her new baby son will love this!
B005RRT1A6|5|This cream helped clear up my son's diaper rash.  I used it with cloth diapers and it did not seem to affect the absorbency.  This cream is expensive, but seems to contain quality ingredients.
B00FQ5T9X8|5|Super cute baby gift!
B0034J2J08|4|I bought this in the hopes that my son will associate this bunny with nap time.  It hasn't worked but he loves to play with the ears and chew on them instead of napping, haha.  I thought the entire bunny would be made of cotton but the label indicates that it's made with corn and other items, all completely non toxic.  It's definitely smaller than I thought but it's big enough for my 6 month old to hold and cuddle (covers his body but not the legs).  It's also a bit thicker than I thought.
B00EU5AL8W|5|Love it
B0017RNGWY|3|the babies just rip these off and play with them. They are a fun bath WALL toy I guess...
B00005BMAL|5|These shields are amazing! I've used them to breastfeed my DD since she was born (now 2 months old) - BF without them is incredibly painful for me, even with a very good latch. My baby has a super powerful suck and also tends to bite down as she falls asleep while nursing (as she often did in the first weeks) and without the shield, i'd get painful damage. Wearing the shields has made the experience bearable. They are super easy to use and wash and sterilize quickly and easily.
B00DOVOJ7M|5|Very helpful.
B001TWI81G|5|I had one of these for my 5 year old sons lunch bag and after a few months one of the 'pouches' broke.  It did not break open as a fault of the manufacturing but rather as a result of a 5 year old taking it in and out of his lunch bag in Kindergarten...  At this price of less than 3 bucks per unit they are a steal.  I bought 4 so I have extras and my wife wants to use one as well.  They stay frozen long enough from when one would leave for work until it's time for lunch some several hours later, say minimum 4-5 hours.  Great buy works well, I recommend.
B003CGYVQS|5|Gave this as a gift to a 3 year old for her birthday and she absolutely loves it...so soft, Mom likes it too!
B00OHGLVSS|5|Those boots are not only warm but cute and easy to put on,very comfortable.
B00HXDVKYW|5|I was very skeptical of using any bottle for my son since I breastfeed but this bottle was the perfect choice for us once he started back to daycare.  We have had no problems and I highly recommend this bottle!  Be sure to always insert the the small silicone ring before you screw the lid on or you and baby will both be drenched!
B004LWZZ2G|1|The bowls are fine...the lids are bad. The lids are almost impossible to remove. We cracked/broke 2 of them trying to take them off. Other times you try so hard to get the lid off and the bowl is too small to get a good grip on and when you finally get the lid off it slips and food goes flying! Within a week the lids went in the trash and we just use the bowls. I have no problem with the other brands.
B00RXX52VO|5|Bought as a gift for a friend and she LOVES it!
B000I1A7AO|5|Really too small to be of much use.
B005ZL6ZR6|5|My twins love to stare at the animal.. Wish the music was longer
B00005BPEU|5|I bought this almost 2 yrs ago and my son still using it. I love it, he can breathe and I don't worry that he might suffocate.  Before we used regular bumper and I found my son under it when he was couple month old. I got scared and bought this one right away.  I'm very happy with it.
B00HCSYQVM|5|I absolutely love this nursing pillow. Where was this when I had my first child 4 years ago? My daughter would only go to sleep with vibration. We searched high and low for a vibration attachment for her crib since it was the only way we could get her to sleep. This would have been perfect for her. It's so easy to insert into the pillow, simply unzip and slide the vibrating device into the pocket and zip the cover again. If your child isn't crazy about the vibration feature, it's very easy to remove as well. The removable cover makes it easy to clean. The neutral colors and elephant pattern make it perfect for either a boy or girl, or to save for a future baby. I also love how firm this pillow is. It actually grips your waist so it isn't sliding all over the place or losing shape. Because it is so firm, it provides more support for baby as well. We took this pillow on a road trip with us recently and it was so easy to throw in the car and take out when we stopped for breaks. It also made a great lap pillow for my older daughter while she was coloring or reading in the car (I know that's not the intended use, but I love anything I can get multiple uses out of these days). This pillow is perfect for floor play for babies who are just getting into the stage where they enjoy sitting up on the floor and playing with toys. All in all, this pillow is so much better than alternative pillows on the market. This is a must add to your baby registry even if you don't plan on nursing. It's still great for bottle feeding and floor play.
B00278WA4W|2|These are great for the first few months of use. But the design of the lid does not allow them to airdry well, especially in the dishwasher and there is significant mildew development as a result. We will be going with a new cup as a result. Tired of scrubbing and not being able to get the mold out of every crevice, even with a bottle/nipple brush.
B005491N6M|5|We bought this tent for our 2 1/2 year old daughter and she loves it.<br />The tent is colorful. The design is beautiful, colorful and tasteful. My daughter stand up in it, hide, and even play with a friend, yet it doesn't take too much space in her small bedroom.<br />This product is quite easy to set up, the \\"instructions\\" are at the bottom of the box. Your best bet is to refer to the photo on the box.<br />it's made of white denim, and i ironed it before to put if together, so it really looks better on day one.<br /><br />It's a bit expensive but poles are made of hard wood,  and it's a little piece of art!<br />My favorites things being that it's NOT made in china, and it's not IKEA either.<br />It's well made and different.
B001NIZSCI|2|I would be happy with this stroller except for one significant feature, the front seat is too narrow and low to the ground - my 2-year-old son's feet hang over the foot rest and at times drag along the ground. My husband and I cannot figure out why they would place the foot rest so close to the seat. If he does place his feet on the foot rest, his knees hit the tray. And he is small for his age, too! Even my 9-month-old daughter experiences the same problem! And the seat seems to tilt forward, which aggravates the situation. Plus, there is a really hard metal bar that runs underneath the front seat - making it even more uncomfortable for them. I have used the stroller for 4-5 months despite these issues, but it is just too uncomfortable for my son, so I am buying a side-by-side stroller instead.
B006Z6E8AG|5|I love this product! I don't make a lot of baby food, so this is great for mashing bananas, for example. I definitely recommend it!
B00138JF7M|1|As much as we love the Ergo Baby, this insert thing just frustrated us.  It doesn't really fit very well and is hard to get in place.  We watched the video over and over...<br /><br />It's very floppy / flimsy and really doesn't provide any support for the babies head (which is why we thought it would be good to have)<br /><br />We ended up using a lightweight fleece blanket about 2-1/2 foot square.<br /><br />I don't think you need this.<br /><br />If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!
B00CSAWINW|5|kind of cheap but perfect for grandma's house and the tray with toys kept the girls (twins) occupied.  They are average sized  at 15 months now and still fit just fine.
B004CPPZYK|5|The lamp is as I expected, it the same as you can see in the picture. It's just a little smaller than I expected. Overall it's just a beautiful addition to a jungle jill crib set.
B00KDKKD1I|5|I ordered the toddler pillow on Prime Day.  When it arrived I felt that it was nicely packaged with a polite and welcoming thank you note from the company.  The pillow is the perfect size for a 1 year old.  It had just enough stuffing to suit my child.  He took to it right away and seems very happy to have this in his crib.
B002VARN3O|4|This bodywash seems to be gentle on my 4 yr old's skin - he doesn't like the smell, but that's not unusual.
B00FSJXUGY|1|The items in the picture are not the bottles u will recieve you will get the hot air ballon design and butterflies
B00CJD5Y4I|5|I'm glad that I purchased this protector when I bought our new car seat.  When I installed it I can already tell it's going to protect my leather much better than if we were to have nothing there.
B00DMCYENW|5|I absolutely LOVE this co sleeper. One of the sides is meant to be positioned up or halfway down for easy access, but it is very hard to move so we just left it up when we moved it. Other than that I have no complaints
B004BCSW2Q|5|I have ordered with this company a few times and have loved their products every time! The first time I ordered there was a big hole in one of the blankets. This may have happened during shipping.. not sure but they were quick to mail out a replacement without making me send the other one back. Also I have never experienced this chemical smell on anything I have ordered. All the blankets I have ordered have arrived looking just as pictured. These are are great for swaddling due to the size and slight stretch that they have. My favorite swaddled blankets! Just like Aden and anais but cuter prints and you can find them cheaper sometimes. Also love the size because even my toddler still loves to use hers every night. Love that they have them on amazon now!
B0011Z8XDO|3|I bought this because it was highly recommended on a toy site. However, the toy scares my baby because the beads inside the triangle make a lot of noise when it spins. He was also already crawling when I purchased the toy, so it was a waste of money. It is extremely cute and very colorful, however. I love the mirrors with the pictures of the lion and monkey (one on each end) and so did my baby as long as the toy did not make any noise while he was looking at it.
B00E6NU5H0|1|does not fit flush with the head... it allows water to get in and is pointless. Big waste of money.
B004GCJMHK|4|For the price, this tub is amazing! My only complaint is how comfortable it is for my baby (not the best).
B000CNOIQ2|5|Cheaper at Target.<br /><br />I purchased this several months ago and under $20, regular price. It's a great warmer and my son was a winter baby so he didn't like cold wipes. I recommend but get it cheaper somewhere else.
B009YSYCZI|5|This was a present to give, so far as I know it works great and the person that is using it is really happy with it
B000KYDOUO|5|We got this for my first, who is now four. My now one year old is playing with this and it's still in perfect shape and she loves it. I would say it's not a great choice to use on hardwoods for those just learning to cruise and walk. There isn't anything to slow a child down once they get going. Good teacher of counting, colors, shapes and 'put-n-take.'
B005175KMU|4|Beautiful, quality, well sized set for my 5 year old.<br />However, mirror is plastic and reflection looks a little warped so we might try to replace it with real glass.<br />Definitely will be too small before she is 10, and I would've probably gotten a larger one to grow into if I'd realized.<br />Makeup can be difficult to get off the paint.  The instructions say that cleaners may remove the paint which makes it more difficult to keep clean.
B006YPTY20|5|My breast fed baby will only take mOmma bottles. We tried Dr. Browns, Tommee Tippee, Avent, Evenflo, Playtex, and several other brands, but she only takes this bottle. I bought the mOmma bottles that the more standard shape too and take the same nipple and she likes those too.
B000CBNSJC|5|SOOOO PRETTY! Gives just the perfect amount of light for a small room. Was easy to install too.
B000EYF71Y|5|I love this shape sorter! I like that it has two shape sorter parts: the animals and the letters! A fun theme and my son enjoys playing with it
B0009JOSNC|5|Good to carry my baby walking on the street
B004C053D8|5|I have been using these for 2 years (2 children), since birth. I wouldn't do it any other way, they are cool looking, so they are very easy to spot. They are easy to clean and most importantly they are absolutely a must for colic and children prone to gas. I have re-purchased these as a gift for a friend whom is expecting. These are great baby shower gifts!
B000KJBFC8|5|We love our travel trays at our house.  My eldest son was given one as a gift and we purchased a second for our younger son because it is so handy!  We have to eat in the car once or twice a week and it allows the kids to keep ahold of their food without their plates flying all over the van.  It is also great for keeping toys in reach of my 16 month-old or allowing my 4 year-old to color and create while on long trips.  A final plus is that the tray is not only handy for the car, but for picnics as well.  We can strap the tray onto our 16 month-old's stroller so he can eat and not just run around free at picnics.  The tray is great!
B00LKUVNHI|5|love the size , came quick, love the company's respose. Will be buying more in the future.
B00HHBRSLE|4|These work great, but can break ... buy extras.  I have two lazy susans and these locks are easy to use, but I have had to replace them a few times over the years (I have children of multiple ages).  I now just keep extras on hand.
B000WUB9O4|5|We have had our Infant-to-toddler rocker in basically continuous use since we brought our son home 6 and a half years ago.  Just as he got a bit big for it, it went back to \\"newborn\\" status when his baby sister came along.  She's almost 4 and still uses it at least once a day.
B00ODZ56YI|5|Fast shipment & looks great.
B004FI7USI|5|Great Product. Kept our little one out of trouble.
B008OIPZW8|5|I love this stroller!  It is so easy to maneuver, even with one hand.  No more struggling to get through doorways - it moves smoothly and turns effortlessly.
B00TQ84AEE|4|Love the chevron pattern and the color. Nothing too frilly it is simple and contemporary.  Has all major events covered.
B000XT30G4|5|Great gate, best value and quality for price.
B007R56YEC|2|It's a really cute product, but like everything else we've wasted money on trying to get our 6 month old to sleep through the night, it hasn't made a bit of difference.
B000GE6S6A|5|The Diaper Genie II is an amazing product. It's extremely easy to use, but, more importantly, it contains all perceptible diaper odors in the bag. The only issue I've had was slight odor leakage inside the pail because I wasn't careful when inserting a diaper through the clamp and a tore very tiny hole in the film with my fingernail. In that instance, the smell did not escape the pail but was released only when I opened the bottom compartment to change out the bag. Subsequently, I took care not to nick the film, and no smell escaped the bag into the bottom compartment. <br /> <br />Before using the Diaper Genie II, we tried to get by with using a normal wastebasket. The smell was FIERCE. Considering just how foul a diaper pail can get, I am utterly astonished at how effective is the Diaper Genie II's design. The cost of the pail and the film is worth not having to subject ourselves to the olfactory torture we used to endure.
B0121R8V4Q|4|This necklace is very cute. I love the color and the size of the silicone teething pieces. It comes with a very cute clothe bag. My daughter is 13 months and is teething hard core lately. She is getting all four of her molars all at once. She has been in a lot of discomfort for a while now. I have tried many different things and this necklace is on the top of my list of soothing items. I don't like her to actually wear it, even though it does have a break loose fastener. I usually wear it around my neck and she sits in my lap and plays with/chews on this necklace. We have definitely had lots of extra cuddles lately. I would definitely recommend this for your child or this would be a great gift item. I received this teething necklace by toddle turtle at a  discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. This opinion is based solely on my experience with this product.
B002FQKB2Y|4|Item was as we expected and did what we wanted to.  Good product.  A lot of people comment on the wall anchors...We didn't use them-they weren't necessary and it all works just fine without.
B00LNECUU0|5|Just got this after my mommy friends recommended this to me. The picture only showed one hook but when I opened the box, it was actually 2! What a nice surprise.<br />It definitely feels sturdy and I love the grey color. The foam part is really nice and soft.
B0011URFRE|5|It will take my grandchild from where he needs it now up to 65 pounds and just being a booster seat
B000056JHN|1|This is only a glorified microphone.  This thing only works if the baby is in a perfect position (which is very rare).  We returned this item, as it frustrated my hubby and caused me lots of stress.  Try renting a doppler for a lot more enjoyment and ease of use.  I have 3 pregnant friends and 2 pregnant neighbors and none of us heard anything but the sound of our stomach gurgling!
B005VC5VQK|5|Gave it as a gift and the person just loved it and started using right away. Good price and looked good.
B002W5RTS2|5|This carrier has worked great so far. It was hard for me to find a carrier that fit my preemie, at 6lbs and most carriers start at 7 or 8 lbs I was worried she would be too small. but she fits in it fine and it is soft and easy to adjust and use. The first time I used it she was really fussy in the store and went right to sleep when I put her in it. It's also helpful around the house for those babies who like to be close to mommy while she's trying to get things done around the house. Overall I think this is a good product that works well at a good price.
B0060INXFK|5|great and comfortable seat that doesn't slide around on wood chairs.  and cleans up easily.  several of my mom friends bought one after seeing ours in action.
B00CMSPFO4|4|the walls in the bedroom are pink, i didn't want to overdo it by buying pink curtains, so decided to choose this one. i loved the design , i think its so adorable and has a quaint amount of pink without overwhelming the room. only problem is the material is too thick, you definitely need sheers!
B00B7M7BKW|5|Truly, this seat protector contained a large puddle of urine when my son wet himself on the way home from a mountain trip. Even more impressive, my son was so tired, he stayed asleep through his accident, so the urine sat puddled on the protector for an hour or more.<br /><br />Nothing reached my car's upholstery. Impressive.
B00U6DLSNO|1|Very practical, only if the price can be cheaper and we definitely will buy more!<br /><br />updated - our leash just got broken at the tip part, where is used to go through the holes.... am upset now...
B003FGX8SW|5|This is a great way to reduce your use of plastic bags, they even give a bit of insulation depending on the foods temperature, very easy to wash out and work again and again
B000ZEZ2BS|5|These pacifiers are great. My son wouldn't take any other pacifier until I found these on the internet. They are reasonably priced and a really nice pacifier. He loves them.
B004FMAMNY|5|I was skeptical buying a carrier because the ones that I have tried in the past we're very complicated to get on and not comfortable to wear. I can put this carrier on and put my son in with no help. It is comfortable to wear. I have used baby slings in the past-this is the next best thing. The straps are easy to adjust. This is a great value.
B0043D28BO|5|This book is wonderful and has a very sweet message! I bought this for our new baby boy who is now one. He loves flipping the soft pages and examining the 3D components (i.e. pop-up shell, ribbons).  I recommend buying the toy and the book. The toy is great because there are different textures and colors on each tentacle and the book just makes it that much more special.
B000WIPN66|3|Very cute and plush toy got it for my 3 month old Godson. It is small but good for baby holding it in his carrier!
B001RTGC3W|5|Much plusher than I though
B00KBGTRAC|5|Easy set up and keeps little guy in place
B000LBEUCW|5|I got this infant car seat for my first daughter who was 8 lbs and 19 inches at birth. It was really too big for her and I had to use the infant positioning support and the additional GoldBug 2 in 1 infant head support when we took her home from the hospital. Our car was latch compatible so installation was easy. She grew quickly and we eventually bought a Britax Decathalon (the best convertible ever!) and I loaned it to my friend who had twins. She already had a Graco Snugride from her first child. Anyways, I noticed a lot of differences between the two carseats:    Pros:  Very well padded and washable cover. There was an extreme difference between the Snugride and the Connection padding and overall quality.    Security straps are well-constructed and didn't twist at all.    Seat is deep and narrow, which is good for small infants and somehow seems safer.    Installation of the base using LATCH in the bucket seats in the outboard (as opposed to the center) position was super easy and very secure. My husband and my friend's husband struggled with the Snugride base which didn't fit well except in the center position of the backseat. It kept tipping up and seemed loose. I think it was because of the bucket seats since they didn't have that problem with the first child and it was the same car (Acura TL).    Putting the carrier in the base and removing it was super easy.    Carrier has shorter handle which is a plus for shorter parents.      Cons:    Connection doesn't fit in the shopping cart upper area.    It's a bit expensive.    If you have the Combi Savvy Soho stroller, it was often difficult to tell if you snapped on the carrier since it would \\"snap on\\" and the carrier would indicate it was locked, but then one side wasn't attached. We usually would lift up on the carrier handle to check and then really push down hard to get it locked on.    The canopy is a bit small and doesn't provide enough sun protection in the stroller...it was also confusing to remove it toget the seat cover off.        All in all, I loved this car seat and felt it was safe and good enough for my friend's babies. She also informed me that she uses it a lot and puts the smaller twin in it since it was deeper.
B008HPP7XA|5|My daughter sleeps like a rock on this thing. The waterproof cover is soft and doesn't make that crinkly sound so typical of waterproof covers. It's a pretty good price for the quality and I expect it to last through the remainder of her toddler hood and our younger child's time with it as well.
B003CK3LDI|5|Keeps baby happy! Our favorite baby product!
B005M4SKJW|5|We have 4 of these bibs. With daily use, it took about 10 months before they started to show wear, and now, after about 14 months, are still going strong. I put them in the washing machine periodically, even though the instructions say not to, which gets them a bit cleaner but probably increased the wear. We have 2 geometric designs, the tiger, and the frog. Now that he's a bit older, my son likes to pick which one he uses, and he almost always goes for the animals first.<br /><br />The &#34;trough&#34; at the bottom stays open very well to catch food. We did baby-led weaning with our son, which means giving chunks of food to eat rather than purees. He did a lot of spitting food out and (sorry, gross but true) a lot of spitting up. This bib caught everything and saved us a huge amount of mess. I highly recommend it!
B0097D4ZMU|5|Bought this to help our son relax in the car. He cries constantly in the car. Hates the car seat (yay for us). But the white noise makes him stop. This is exactly what we needed!! The volume is great I was worried it wouldn't be loud enough but it is. I even bring it along in the stroller for when he gets a little fussy. Best $9 I ever spent!<br /><br />C - Mom of 4
B0006BAJO0|5|excelente producto
B000FI3QSK|5|I have used these since she was a week old....  Not sure if other brands are comparable but these work g8 and I have no complaints or desire for anything else.  Nail clipping is NOT easy but these do help me get the job done.  They are big and so easy to maneuver using one and a half hands (I cut her nails while nursing so she wiggles less but thus don't have full function/reach of both of my hands on the nail being trimmed).  They are pretty much just regular ole clippers but encassed in plastic which makes for easier handling and helps with \\"accident\\" prevention....of which we haven't had one yet...And SO sharp so the job gets done with one clip and fast!
B00C5HT7ZU|4|Easy to carry and put back together.  Could be a little bigger but, overall nice product and niece loved it!
B003OEIN7G|5|I am very pleased with the quality of the backpack and the lunch tote.  As my daughter-in-law said it was just very good quality!
B007HS6W6Y|5|My little guy hates riding in the car in the dark and having this mirror on his seat and being able to turn the light and music on while I'm driving has been a lifesaver!<br /><br />Great price point, easy to install and the battery life is great!
B001O9HWHA|3|I got these for night feedings. I didnt want to use plastic bottles to heat the milk because of fumes/chemicals ect..<br />The design is good for gripping.
B004L5Z2V2|5|this rattle is just as in the picture.  cute for boys whose daddy's love planes.  i gave it as a gift and the recipients were pleased :)
B00005C2NP|3|This is a wonderful product when traveling; however, you must PLAN a head. Say for example: you feed your baby every 3hours, to avoid frustration; you need to activate the bottle warmer 25-30mins before, in order to have it ready for the baby. If you warm it right when the baby needs it, you're going to have them fussing and crying for at least 20min before you can feed. Now that is frustrating... Remember---this product is conducive for traveling, however, you need to activate it 25-30min before every feeding... Hope this helps!
B0016P8K3W|5|Worked great, and fast!!
B000056JHI|5|If your 4 leg little one has suddenly developed a distasteful interest in the cat box, this is a quick / cheap solution. The cat easily jumps it to do his business; the dog can only watch from a far. No more of those \\"gee, I hope that's a Baby Ruth bar\\" moments and it gives the cat some much needed alone time.
B0009F5B7S|5|I love my New Native sling! I have used it so many times and find it very easy to use and very versatile.  My baby is a very chubby guy and at 9 months he is 24 pounds and still fits in the sling.  He loves it too, whenever we are out shopping or even at home and he is a little fussy I put him in the sling and he calms right down and snuggles in.  I've even nursed while walking around..in many places: Costco, Disneyland, Walmart! Very discreet.  I also love the fact that it is small enough to fold up and put in my diaper bag, so I always have it.  No bulky rings or padding.  I'm buying them for all my family with babies! I love it, and I've gotten lots of compliments on it.  A must have item! <br />Erica <br />Washington state
B0011ECPA2|5|Exactly what my daughter wanted. Great product.
B00M2I3MVM|5|This works great for my baby! She is 8 months old today and I just starting using this about a month or 2 ago. Since my house is not child proofed yet I like that I can move this around the house and even use it outside. It's really big so for now I have taken one of the fence parts out and it's still big enough for her to play in. I like the fact that she can play safely in it because she tends to get bored being in the swing or other devices that don't allow her to move around. It's easy to put together and take apart but it is kind of heavy if you move it from room to room, fully assembled, like I do. I highly recommend it!
B006ZVV0P2|5|Works great for our 2012 Honda odyssey. I was worried they wouldn't cover the whole seats but they do. Should've bought them when we bought the car.
B000FMQWS2|5|Fun entertaining toy. My son loves it. Light and colorful. I would recommend it for kids under 2 year old.
B000MEB3GE|5|I saw this gadget online and thought, ehh I will try it. Oh man am I glad I did! This is my 2nd child, and I never have to wonder how long it's been since shes eaten or had a diaper change. I love this. It even has a flashlight on it so I can change her in the middle of the night without waking daddy. Love it! I will recommend this to everyone I know!
B00074FY9Q|3|I really like the idea of the feeder and think it can work pretty well.  The reason it did not get five stars from me is that they are so hard to keep clean once you use them.  I washed them by hand and ran them through the dishwasher, but for some reason all of the food never came out.  Perhaps it was my fault for putting bananas and other squishy pieces in because once the food was mushed in there it was all over.  I think they may work better with more solid food that does get caught in all the little holes.  Like I said, really like the idea, but I need a better way to get all of the mashed food out once you use it!
B00E19T2EQ|5|Washed well. Keeps my little one's mattress a little warmer than a regular cotton sheet. It matches our Dr. Seuss theme perfectly.
B006QRFDG2|5|This bag fits 3 to 5 diapers very well. I don't get the &#34;wet&#34; feeling like I do with my other bag. I'm very happy with the purchase.
B00G5JGU72|4|First, understand that this is made of fabric, not plastic or wood, so I'm not sure how well it will stand up to the use of my future grandson.  But I loved the toy chest and it goes very well with the nautical theme  nursery.  I used it as part of a baby shower gift and filled it with diapers and lots of other must haves for a newborn baby - it is a nice size.  Was a little disappointed in that the fabric was a little &#34;puckered&#34; around the whale.  Overall though I am very satisfied with the toy chest.
B0042D69V0|5|Very happy with this purchase.  Fairly easy to put together.  My son loves it, several toys to play with.  The price is right.
B0021AFQQU|4|Only con is that the straps twist. Other than that it is wonderful and really comfortable for my daughter.
B004HEX68I|5|Awesome chair... Will confirm functionality after some time... Usually break these things easily.
B00318CO6G|3|good
B0015TM0M6|5|gr8 for suctioning snot.  my twins were severely congested, and the bulb suctioning did not work (too large and did not fit there nasal passage).  this product worked gr8. worked better with loose secretions though.  the thicker secretions would come up and was easier to wipe off. kids doing much better. they still dont like this much though.
B00GY1SCW2|5|I bought this pump as a back up and it works great. I also have the Medela manual pump and I think the Lansinoh is just as good - and a little more comfortable when pumping. I get the same amount of milk and also like the Lansinoh bottles.
B002UD65T0|5|I purchased this for my Fisher-Price Zen Collection Gliding Bassinet because it only came with one sheet.  The mattress is oval in shape so it's very hard to find a sheet that fits correctly.  If you read the reviews for that item several people had a hard time finding a replacement sheet.  This sheet is flexible and seems to fit any shape.  It works perfectly for my bassinet.  The only negative thing I can say is that I ordered Ecru and the color I received appeared pure white.  I didn't really care so I still give a 5 star review.
B00GLFQLMO|5|We were finally able to use our mirrors today when we brought our twins home from the hospital. These mirrors were very east to install in the second row of our Honda Odessy. They are large mirrors, clear and very easy to adjust.
B00M1I9P9G|5|Looks good and hasn't shrunk after washing it, so two thumbs up.
B00MBKHZNC|5|I have been testing these dryer balls out for a little while now. Having never used them I only assumed they were used more to aid in the decrease of drying time versus conquering the static issues found in clothes. I will say that after a few loads these dryer balls remain in my laundry room ready to be used with each load-large or small.<br /><br />The dryer balls are made of wool. They aren't hollow. Keep in mind they are not squishy so if you are thinking that these would be like the touch of a sponge, you'd be wrong. The dryer balls are the size of a standard baseball with the feel of a softball. They did not have a scent when I took them from the sack they came in. Overall these balls are really worth the money. They have cut down on my drying time and that in itself is a money saver.<br /><br />The soap nuts are completely new for me. I was a bit put off by their overwhelming smell at first but apparently that is normal. This is definitely a different way to clean for me and great for those with allergies to detergents.
B003CK3LDI|5|Great!
B00AEG15SQ|5|good staying power in sun
B0000CEJX2|4|I got this swing for my babyshower. We actually wanted to change it for a Graco swing with the extra toys, swing speed and music, but decided to try this first. We were very impressed with it from the beginning with the easy setup and sturdy frame. My 2 month old baby loved it from the beginning and after being niggly became as quiet as a mouse in it. She often falls asleep in it or will smile and coo. This gives me the opportunity to carry on with my household chores or other things. This is a &amp;quot;lifesaver&amp;quot; without all the bells and whistles of the other swings. I often just put her favourite Pooh bear on the feeding tray for her to watch and she is fine.
B008RJ9BH4|5|I love that this tub adjust to the different sizes as the baby grows. Right now our baby is still newborn but with the little holder it makes giving her a bath much easier.
B006ZVV0P2|5|I absolutely love this.  It keeps dirt and footprints off the back of your seat!!!  It also gives a place to store books and DVDs for the Kids!!!!
B001X9IMSE|5|These breast shields were exactly as I expected.  The fit my Medela Freestyle pump that i use 3-4 times per day.  Needed replacements so i don't spend my entire life washing and sterilizing pump parts.
B0011MZ358|4|I bought the precious puppy for my 2 month old son. It seems to be well made, my only disappointment is the backing of the blankie. According to the picture it looks like the lining is made of satin/silk, however when I received it, the lining is made from a siff stripe cotton fabric, which makes it a bit too hard for my little one.  My older son has the kiddopotamus ones which he's had for the past 3 years, and he loves it to death.  I had to buy an identical one for him, since he took it everywhere and it needed to be washed quite regularly, so I had to have a replacement for him while one was having a \\"bath\\". The kiddopotamus one is not lined with any other fabric, it's just the soft velvety fabric all over, except for the ends which is made of the satin, and it really is cuddly. he would rub the blankie on his face till he fell asleep.
B004KV6UH2|1|I LOVED these cups for the first month or so - I even went back and bought two more.  I thought it was really smart design and my daughter loved drinking out of them.  Unfortunately, the straw (with minor wear) starts to become like a siphon and liquid just pours out of the straw while it's sitting there!  Such a mess!  On top of that, the straw gets moldy where the mouth piece and bottom piece connect under the cup's lid and you cannot clean it away.  I called the company and they said this was possible only when the straws are too worn and that is why they carry replacement straws.  They sent me new straws and within one month the straws were moldy and siphoning.  The straws shouldn't need replacing EVERY month!!  Customer service did not respond after I contacted them again.  Very disappointed.
B003C1Q1ZM|4|I should have read the dimensions more carefully. I wanted a reallllllllly big piggy bank and this was only a large piggy bank. The bank its self was well made and I am sure would bring joy to many households. Amazon was gracious enough to accept a return and give me my money back so I could continue my hunt for the reallllllly big bank.
B008JFRSZ8|4|The material, the size, and the design are exactly what I want. The only problem is that it is not water proof and if you want to put ice in it, it won't work.
B0007KMUH4|5|I love this product.  I just bought it for my second baby.  I did not know about it with my first and bought other bulky strollers that were heavy, didn't fit in my car and/or did not push well.  I discovered this only after I bought all those strollers and my husband would have flipped if I had bought another stroller.  I finally talked him into purchasing this for our second child and we both agree we could not live without it!  It is super light.  Easy to fold and unfold.  Will fit even the trunk of smaller cars (fits in my tiny Lexus IS). It is easy to get the Graco car seat out and pop it right into this stroller. I love it for running errands with my baby. I also have a jogger that I will use for exercising.  If you have a small shopping trip you can get away with using the basket below and not pushing a card.  You can wheel this stroller right into restaurants and next to your table (it is not as bulky as other strollers so you can just move a chair and keep it there without it protruding into the walkway).  I would highly recommend this to anyone with a Graco car seat!!
B005SP2LWW|4|So hot for tropical weather im in Panama Republic of Panama, for the rest is very practical
B000H1IYXW|5|The bed rail works great for my 20-month old daughter.  It is nice to have the extra length since she still moves around a lot when she sleeps.  The rail was relatively easy to put together and feels very sturdy once it is in place.
B00AA6LU0S|5|I love this toy organizer. It is perfect size and looks very nice.  For the price it is very well made.
B00CISTACQ|5|I purchased this feeder after trying the fabric ones.  I spent so much time picking banana boogies out of the fabric one and could never get it completely clean.  I used the fabric one once and I just couldn't use it again.  The \\"nipple\\" comes out of this one like a bottle/sippy and washes up so easily.  I know it is clean when I give it to her.  My daughter is 8 months old, she can't open it, and she also likes to chew on the handles when the treat is gone.  The cap is a great feature, also.  I highly recommed this for starting solids and teething.  This is going to be one of my go-to gifts for baby showers.
B002JACAIY|5|Bought this set for my grand daughter. I love the pattern ..I've washed it quite a few times..Holds up great..A great buy..Very cute!!
B00GRS9ZVO|5|The Sassy Disney Fun Bath Tub is a big hit at our house.  The infant sling supports baby above the water and the included &#34;puffer&#34; fish becomes a hand-held shower.  You simply fill the plastic fish and water drains out the many small holes.  It holds about a cup and a half with each fill.<br /><br />The sling allows baby's feet to reach the water to enjoy kicking and splashing.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that the sling is rather difficult to clip onto the tub.  You must stretch the sling very tightly while simultaneously trying to force the tight-fitting clips over the rim of the tub.  But once assembled, it's all fun and games for baby.
B000UWTXNS|5|I bought this for my 4 month old daughter who is teething like crazy. She loves it! It is small enough for her to easily hang on to, and light enough for her to put into her mouth no problem. The RaZberry isn't as large as it looks in the picture, but still generously sized, so that they can gnaw away, but not choke on it. So far this has been her favorite out of all the teethers we've purchased for her.
B0012Q5F0Q|5|very nice product. exactly what i was expecting. If your looking for a small frame for a wallet size photo that is cute, this is your product.
B006PB2H40|2|This is a nice product, just not a gate! It sturdy & good if you want to put it in a hallway/passage where you can easily step over it, but not at the bottom of the stairs (like I wanted to) as its dangerous to have to step over. Also, is not suitable for top of stairs...
B003V4A5XO|2|I hate this stupid thing. The stroller part has wheels that rarely go in the same direction. They stick all the time and wont turn. Then once you stop using the car seat in the stroller and just use the stroller, it doesnt have any time of barrier to keep your baby from just falling out of the stroller seat. sure it has straps and of course we always use them but who in the world makes a seat for a baby that has no way for the baby to not fall out the second you put them in, before you have time to strap them in. nutz!    Then the car seat itself is a lemon! I dont know which is worse, the seat or the stroller. they both are horrible in my opinion. just constant headaches. The seat is sooo annoying to try to fasten because you have to hold the two hooks together while you simultaneously try to stick them into the bottom buckle. with a squirming baby that is often impossible. Plus the fasteners have accidentally pinched the baby when you try to fasten them.     I could really go on and on for days i hate this thing soooo much. the only reason i even gave it 2 stars is because it technically functions but boy is it a big headache!
B0080DV0ZI|3|Seems like a reasonably quality rain cover. However, as stated it doesn't really work for the Baby Jogger Deluxe Pram. It covers, but the side cutouts are in the wrong location, it doesn't hang down far enough, and it's certainly not the custom fit you'd want for this price point. Unfortunately you'll have to pay even MORE money to get the rain canopy specifically designed for that product.
B005YYS3AQ|5|I was so happy to receive these sheets. They were actually the color they show online! They arrived quickly and are a perfect fit. I will most likely be buying more now!
B00JB2PJBS|5|Awesome product. Doesnt take up storage in my car like a stroller would
B00SCC4EVE|5|I love these burp clothes. The fabric is so soft and the prints are fabulous.  I like the colors and prints because they are so distinct and gender neutral. I get compliments on them everywhere. I also love that they aren't as thick so they roll up nicely in my purse or in my Ergo pocket when I don't need to take a big diaper bag around with me.
B003V1XE1M|1|When I received the product I was very pleased with the look and feel. The top cover is soft cotton like material and the bottom is some sort of laminated material that breathes allowing your child to sleep on it without sweating all night. She had an \\"accident\\" a couple weeks after we bought this and it did not seem to help, but it was a rather large accident so I thought maybe that was the issue. Another accident occurred a few nights later, only this time it was a very small accident and it leaked right through the barrier and onto the sheet. I do not recommend this product.
B00BBJZ2AC|5|Simple to use
B0021KYGF2|5|I got exactly what I ordered... replacement parts for my Medela Breast Pump.  Thank-you for an accurate description of your product
B00JP83JZQ|5|only using this thing at night (since we keep it upstairs, too big to carry up and down all the time) and son started to sleep almost through the night.  Not sure if its the day dreamer or not but it works when we need him to sleep. Before he would wake up often.
B004YL3332|2|These do not have any type of adhesive to stick to the floor around where they are so for us these did not work out the way we wanted them to.
B001CW7CVK|5|We were given the \\"regular\\" Cloud B Twilight Turtle as a gift when my son was born 5 yrs ago. He had slept with it every night until a few months ago, when his baby brother (who also loves it) climbed into his bed and was playing with it and dropped it on the floor. (Not the first time it had been dropped, but unfortunately, this time it broke something). So, when we went to purchase a replacement, we saw the sea turtle and thought it would be cute. I also liked that there was a \\"double\\" constellation setting, where both the green and the blue lights display at the same time- pretty cool.   When our 3 year old daughter saw it, she claimed she \\"needed\\" one, and we ended up buying the ladybug one for her (also very cool- with red lights).  All 3 of our youngest kids love these things, and often (esp when our 5 yr old was younger), when he would awake in the night, rather than crying for us, he would turn this on and look at the stars until he fell asleep again (we would pass his room and peek in- and see the lights).  So, we just love these, and they are very well made, as our first one lasted 5 years through many bumps and knocks.  The company we ordered from \\"Tromo Electronics LLC\\" - was the cheapest total cost (with shipping), and we received the order a day earlier than we were told we would. Very pleased!
B005QU55EA|3|The cords stretch too much.
B00AR2B5X2|3|I like it:)
B003ASXD4Y|3|Was hopeing to get a softer material and received in good timing considering we had a snow storm.<br />thank u
B001QIH7QA|3|My husband and I are avid cyclists and hope to share the joy of riding a bicycle with our son soon. We've been searching for the right balance bike and thought this one had a fair price and nice styling. I'm glad I saw it in person in a local toy store before I placed an order though. When I noticed that the fabric for the seat cover is merely attached with exposed staples under the seat, I thought that was a really cheap and dangerous way of doing things, so the search for a better balance bike continues.
B008CDR7LW|5|Mom loved this! Don't know who's going to get to play with it ... Mom or Baby!
B00JQYS0XU|4|Very nice nursing pillow. It seems well made, with bright, fun colors. 4/5 stars because the price is nuts. But it's pretty high quality, so it might be worth it for you.
B0052QYLUM|5|We registered for this based on the good reviews in Baby Bargains.  We have been very happy with this monitor.  Their customer service is FABULOUS! We had an issue and they mailed us a new one if before they received our old one! Mae is awesome. We even tested out a couple other more expensive baby monitors during the 3 days we didn't have one and they went back as soon as we got our replacement in the mail!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />The VOX and auto mute settings. We tested a few other monitors that did not have the auto mute - a must when running white noise in the nursery!<br />Video quality is great - our nanny often takes pictures of the screen and they are really clear<br />Tilt - has a really great tilt on the camera so no need to wall mount. Currently sitting on the dresser and has a clear shot of the crib<br />range - we live in a 4 level house and have never had any issues with it being out of range.<br />interference - not sure why some have issues with interference. We've never had any interference with either our wi-fi or cell phones and the monitor is usually near the laptop/cells since we work from home a few days a week.<br /><br />Cons:<br />wished it had a pan and zoom.<br />Volume - wish the volume was a little louder. My husband sleeps thru it quite often which is why I have to have it by my side of the bed since i'm a light sleeper.<br /><br />overall this is a great baby monitor!
B00188XW26|5|My daughter LOVES this ball.  It really helps with their grasp and with learning to pass things from hand to hand.  I strap it on to her carseat with one of the toy straps and she plays with it forever.
B00FXPSDNI|5|Nuby actually sent me this teether to review, but I've purchased several of their teethers before then, so I'm very familiar with this brand. We have the blue sea horse teether, and it's really cute and colorful! The ring and the shape of the actual teether itself is easy for small hands to grab, and the multiple teething areas are good for cutting different teeth. My son's favorite part is actually the little fabric ties at the top. For some reason, he really likes chewing on fabric.
B00CPC29YG|5|They've helped reduce gas in our babies and they responded well to the nipple.  They take a little longer to clean, but worth the effort.
B00295MQLU|5|This bra is great, I bought the black one in Medium. I was really surprised it fit. It's very comfortable, easily adjustable for my size and supports the flange of the Ameda Purely Yours Ultra Dual Electric Pump very well. I don't pump out much milk at once, so am not sure if it will support the entire bottle full of milk, but I like that it comes with straps if I need the extra support. The bra feels like a good quality product, not a thin material that will wear out in a few washes. It is well designed and soft against my skin. I like the black one, it looks stylish and is discretely hidden under loose clothing. I use it above my nursing bra, and sometimes while pumping only one side, I am able to feed the baby on the other side by tucking the bra down, which is very convenient.
B00LV8N3RC|2|I had high hopes for this camera from the praise received in the reviews. But sadly, I was greatly disappointed. One of the cameras did not have a UID sticker nor was it in the firmware so there was no way to add it to the iOS app. The cameras kept cutting out and I purchased 3 of them and they all did the same. Picture quality was okay but not impressive.<br /><br />The web interface was not good at all. And if you have your wifi protected with WPA2 or any other password security enabled, and are not in IT like myself, you are going to have a very hard time setting this up.<br /><br />The customer service number on Polaroid's web site was of no use. The only thing you get when you call the number is that they are closed and to leave a message. I did that three days in a row. So, customer service is non-existant.<br /><br />All three are being shipped back today.
B00BUAL4KO|5|Love this pail liner! We have two Planet Wise liners. Holds enough diapers for us to wash every other day - two days. We use them in our diaper dekor pail, fits perfectly. Plus the fox print is absolutely adorable.
B00EOML96O|2|This is the second time we bought this bottle cleaner because we love the sponge. The sponge itself is great! But when you try to use it even gingerly, the sponge just cannot hold up and gets torn very easily. The nipple cleaner tour first. Then the main bottle cleaner no longer was securing inside and was sliding out of the wand.<br />We will still try to look for a similar sponsor but better build quality.
B00WCI4XWY|1|Arrive in a cheap plastic bag from China.  Color is different too.
B004071ZOY|5|This was a gift for our expectant swim coach (club's logo is a shark). Can't wait to see her baby dressed as our mascot!
B005UMY7H0|5|I will use this for a very long time.  It has worked great for us and will last a long time.
B00G5KVNKU|5|I received this nursing cover as a gift and am so happy with it! First of all the fabric is just stunning and the thought and care that went into the design is smart! I have been getting so any compliments on it too.  I will defiantly order one as a gift too... I love mine!
B002UD65YU|5|for some reason my new born diapers are leaking and this pad saves me time and the hassle of changing crib sheets every time he has a leak.Easy to wash,soft to touch and waterproof.They are flannel so they are warm dont put the baby right on them or he will sweat
B003Y53YR4|5|Met all my expectations.
B000O1SHI2|4|Overall I'm pleased with my Bumbleride Flyer for many of the same reasons other reviewers have identified.  However, my biggest con is the folding.  I am fairly average size person (5'4\\", 110 lbs) but I struggle with folding and unfolding.  My much stronger husband can easily unfold it open, but I squat on the floor and open one side, then open the other side, then stand up while trying to \\"shake\\" it open...I feel like a fool every time I open or close it.  I've tried my girlfriends' strollers and they are so much easier to open!  Also, the catch lock is so annoying.  You have to \\"open\\" it but because of the positioning it still catches while trying to open.  Also, I visited my sister in NYC with the Bumbleride and this stroller is NOT for the city.  It's too big and bulky for the tiny restaurants, stores and tight hallways and sidewalks, but I didn't buy it for that purpose so it's not a problem for me.
B00IM8FZIE|5|great and fast shipping
B006ZM043U|5|Love these so much! I've never seen these in store so I was excited when I saw them on here!
B001ABZGU2|5|These links are great for additions to my daughter's jumperoo.  They also work great with her folding, portable activity seat (the Kidco Go Pod).  We also put a few inside a clear plastic coffee can and voila!  Instant noisy and fun toy.  This is the second set of links we've purchased because we use them so many ways.
B00B2F7XVQ|4|i would buy it again, they are perfect for what i used them for and the ribbon was so pretty , good for cupcakes and loose candy
B0049U5UC0|4|Not the best quality but it is a cute moses basket with nice sheet...Ribbons on the side get loose from time to time which may cause a hazard right there!!! But overall it is a good item for the price
B00569H3V4|5|I have been buying the sassy blue bags because the price of these were not comparable.  When the price lowered I tried them and not only do they alleviate my guilt for destroying the environment, they are great bags!    The size is the same as the sassy bags.  I like the packaging of these better - they are perforated and easier to get out of the box.  They have no smell which is nice too.
B003ZW7R9C|5|It's perfect.  My baby LOVES IT
B0063VCSEQ|5|Exactly what my son had as his &#34;blankie&#34; so this was perfect. Prompt fulfillment and delivery was appreciated when it comes to making your little one happy. And you can never go wrong with having a spare.
B00C2D5TJK|5|I had a few of these for my daughter when she was in cloth diapers. They were always great - kept everything separate and didn't leak. Just bought this one for my husband who is starting a truck driving career and he was excited. They are wonderful for laundry. beach going, babies, camping, just about anything.
B00ADSSR6I|4|This princess blanket is so soft and cuddly! My baby girl loves to be wrapped up in it. I believe I got this blanket for a very affordable price.
B002SZH45E|2|While this product works efficiently at whag it is supposed to do, I can't help but notice that every time I use it for an illness in the Baby, I end up with the same cold, if not worse. It makes sense!
B00PBAU80Q|1|Gross. I couldn't get it down. Orange pledge. ill choke down the horse pills instead.
B0076IAG9E|5|Keeps my 1 year old form opening the cabinets. Easy to install, restricts child's access and easy for adults to gain access (which is important for kitchen and bathroom cabinets).
B005UD4GNO|4|I think this would be a great product as a toddler rail. But I bought it because I am bed sharing with my baby and I don't want her to roll off the bed. We have a tempurpedic mattress and I don't feel like I can tighten it securely.  The cost is high, too. But it is made very well. You have to secure it about 5 inches from the edge of the bed. So for a toddler, it's probably fine. For us, we just have less space to share with the baby. Overall, I would say this is the best toddler rail I've seen so far.
B00N3K4HP8|5|Perfect size for 2 years old
B005IZ0HFK|5|A nice variation on the 'learn to' toy for teaching buttons, velcro etc.  Gave to a great neice who also just loved it as her carry around 'doll'.
B000BYDXP4|4|I purchased this gate for a wide space between my living room and kitchen.  It does fit the space, but it moves a lot.  I was hoping to find a solid gate for the space, but this was the widest gate I could find.  It does the job it was meant to do, but my child has wobbled it forward and backward so much that it came loose from the wall and we had to redrill new holes and patch the old ones.
B004NG64ZM|5|This case is spacious with lots of pockets both zippered and not.  It is just the right size for everyday use or travel.
B00CXPYWCC|5|These bags are awesome! Fit inti bottles with notch to keep them in place. Rinse and recycle, no messy bottle clean up.
B00NFJICEO|2|seems very flimsy. a very heavy child will tip it or possibly crack it. it seems like it will not be durable to stand the test of time. more like a disposable product. may be good for long road trips when a bathroom isnt available.
B0046S4N5A|5|Great for the baby! Wish I had one...
B00IABI87S|5|Great cuddly stuffed animal for the Grand Daughter.
B008JGOH6K|5|Love this wallet. It has enough room for all items!
B004UBZEHY|5|Although I was initially put off from this bag because it is not feminine or baby-cute (two pluses as far as my husband is concerned, and now as baby is not so new, I agree), I would not carry another bag.  I have even come to enjoy the compact, black look that doesn't scream DIAPER BAG.  I have noticed it's smaller than many women's purses.  I own a larger diaper bag, but I find I very seldom use it, because there are so few places you really need to carry that much stuff.  Although this bag is small, I think I can get in quite a bit.  People have called this my clown bag, because I can pull out a few diapers, wipes, changing pad, face wipes, pacifier wipes, and three or four toys/books, a snack cup, or skip a toy and take some baby food and eating-out essentials.  I put diapers in one interior pouch, and I keep bandaids and small diaper ointment packets and a tiny nose sucker in the other that's intended for bottles.  I put a sippy cup in one side pocket (I nursed, so I don't know about carrying bottles), tissue pack and binky in the other, and the large front pocket is for my wallet, keys, phone, lotion, chapstick and whatnot.  The thin back pocket was nice for easy access to a burp cloth when the tyke was very little.  Now, I tend to shove notes or mail in there when we're running errands.  In winter, I carry around a small light blanket, too, but I usually end up tying that around a shoulder strap.  I know people who don't feel comfortable leaving the house without the kithen sink, and I initially felt nervous relying on so little, but it caused me to be efficient, and now I can't imagine lugging more around with me.  Who needs the shoulder pain?  The zipper is awesome - very easy to use single-handedly.  I love this with my strollers, because it slips nicely over the handle bars and isn't so heavy that it causes the stroller to keel over.  Definitely recommend this bag!  The only issue I have ever had with it is that my husband dropped it off of the front of the stroller and ran it over, making a small hole where it skidded along the road.  For 14 months of daily use, not bad - and who on earth really runs over their diaper bag?
B00AV53ZCY|5|Can let my daughter wander without the worry of leaks. Wish they made a cup bigger that works with these tops.
B002SW3D20|5|Bought this as a gift for my soon-to-be new nephew and my sister-in-law loved them! They are nice and big, much more so than standard swaddling blankets.
B00D1V2A4O|5|Works well for my 10 month old baby to crawl around safely in the tub without slipping. Very happy with this mat!
B00F2MXK2Q|5|very cute
B002VARN3O|1|If I could give California Baby a zero I would. Sure enough, they now have Sodium Benzoate in many of their products.<br />I'll follow up with the company, but I'm not buying anything more from them.
B0054QZIL6|5|These bags are so easy to use once you figure it out.  The instructions are pretty easy to follow.  The refills last a pretty long time and are a good price through amazon.
B005OUIT5E|5|Our grandson is sitting up now and has outgrown the reclining baby tub, but we were concerned about him being stable in the tub sitting up.  We got this to put into a small baby tub (non-reclining) to provide the needed stability, and it works very well.  The size is right for a small tub, and it seems to be a quality-made product.
B008VUN4P4|5|We live in a colder region of the US during Halloween time so this outfit was perfect! It kept her warm and it was super cute on top of it!
B005PNIN1K|5|I have taken my little guy to a number of sporting events with these.  I noticed other babies his age were disturbed by the noise, but my little guy slept soundly wearing these.  I definately recomend them.
B000056OV3|1|I am a mother of two (4 1/2 & 18mos). Received a genie at my first shower...hated it! Very complicated to use, expensive refills and overall inconvenient when dealing with an infant. Found that the older my baby got the worse the genie smelled. Now I use a small garbage can with regular grocery bags...much cheaper. One way to \\"seal in the freshness\\" of soiled diapers-try buying no-frills ziploc sandwich bags. At less than $... a box (100 ct) they last longer than genie refills and work a whole lot better! I suggest to all my pregnant friends to remove it from their registry.
B007700SD0|5|This cart cover is very soft and comfortable. While it is kind of big for restaurant high chairs, it still works great. I love the taggies to attach toys to. I haven't tried to wash it yet, but it is machine washable.
B002GWW1SO|5|OK
B00ZP6NXCG|5|With all the drama around breastfeeding, I thought that I would cover up rather than start problems where ever I decided to feed my baby. I had tried a blanket, but they always fall off and I had no idea what to do. Then I saw this Nursing Utter Cover by Haidue and thought that this was something that I truly needed. And it was. When I got this I was so excited, I loved the colors, as it was something that was stylish and not all drab. To put it on is as simple as putting it over your head. This cover has kept my daughter and my chest covered when it is time to feed her, I love this thing and am so glad that I found something that pleases everyone!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.
B0043M57C2|4|This was for my 5 month old grandson for Christmas.  At this age he can care less, but his mother liked  it.  So did I,
B00FBEOC2W|5|Perfect bottles and they were pink even better for my great-grandchild.
B001C0J9CM|5|I think this dress is adorable!!  Washed well in gentle cycle... not any fading to speak of.  Did run a tad small, so I suggest getting the next size up.
B00DHINGK8|5|After reading multiple reviews on the Brtiax B-Agile and B-Safe travel system and its competitors, we decided to go with Britax. I've got to say it's been totally worth it. We've been using it for two months now, and after watching other moms either lug a carrier or struggle with different strollers, I've never been so grateful.<br /><br />The Britax system is so easy to use. It takes only a few seconds to fold/unfold the stroller and snap or release the carrier. And while the stroller did require some assembly, the carrier was ready to use immediately (minus adjusting straps for baby). We use this system almost everywhere we go. Even when we go grocery shopping, I push the stroller and my husband the cart. One of the best features when using the entire system is that the canopies from both come together, keeping prying eyes out and helping baby feel safe and secure. There's also a great peek-a-boo window to check up on your little one without exposing them to everyone and everything.<br /><br />As to complaints that the underneath basket on the stroller is too small, that hasn't really been an issue. My diaper bag fits -- although a bit snugly -- or can hang from the handle when I have other things to cart around as well.<br /><br />I can't imagine transporting our baby in anything else and highly recommend it.
B009WSPLO6|5|I really like these reusable food pouches. I like that I can put my homemade baby food in it and my daughter love squeezing out the food into her mouth. I like how easy it is to refill these. I just screw the top off, between the bag part and the orange top, put my food in the bag and rescrew the top on. I have bought the store bought bags before and have heard that some people have found mold in the bags. These bags make is so I know what is in each bag I fill I don't have to guess. These are so easy to clean also. I just fill my sink with a little soap warm water, take off the top, swish the parts around in the water, then wash off. I really like that the one side has an open little &#34;window&#34; on it so I can tell how much is still left in each pouch. I go to the laundry mat each week and I have these in my fridge filled so all I have to do is grab them and go so she can eat her food at the laundry mat. I think these would be great when we go on trips also. I plan on buying more of these in the future. I recommend these. I got this product at a discount for giving my honest opinion, all opinions are my own
B0034G5UZC|5|bought 2 , one for each boy. Even though it is hard to keep up with everything i am hoping to fill out everything soon. Thank you!
B001W03A18|5|The main reason that I purchased this bassinet was because of the automatic rocking. However, I didn't need to use the rocking one while my son slept in it for the first four months. My first two children loved being rocked, and I always had to do it manually. Getting a rocking bassinet seemed like a really good idea. I never needed it this time. Go figure. But the rocking did work great as I obviously tried it. There was a little noise from it, but no more than you get with a baby swing. The night light, the music and sounds, the fact that you can lock the bassinet so it doesn't rock, the detachable toys, the mesh siding so that the baby won't soffocate if his/her face gets pressed on the side, and the generously sized basket underneath all made this an outstanding bassinet. Even though I didn't use the rocking part of it, I would still choose this bassinet the other two that I had for my first two children. I loved it and I'm going to hold onto it \\"just in case\\" there's another little bundle of joy that comes along.
B000KN2P6E|3|this product helps for when you have the baby in the stroller and the baby is asleep. i like that it has the holes on the side for air. but i wouldnt say its great for a car seat cover since its think and clear. i bought the foil kind for the car seat sun protector
B001B1FHIC|5|Fantastic invention. Really helps with washing toddlers hair
B006K4R3VO|5|I love this stroller. I wish we would have bought this a long time ago!<br />My child has special needs and cannot sit unassisted, but she is way more comfortable in this stroller than she is in her Adaptive stroller.  I feel that she is actually more safe in this stroller than her adaptive stroller.  It's light and easy to close.  It's so easy to go up and down our 2 front steps.  Maneuverability is awesome.  My daughter is comfortable in it, I love that it reclines all the way back for when she is sleepy.  My ONLY complaint is that her diaper bag does not fit in the basket on the bottom of the stroller.  It was very easy to put together.  i did it myself with no tools, no help, and within 10 minutes.  The canopy is huge and definitely blocks the sun from hitting her face.  The rain cover doesn't come with the stroller so you have to order that separately.  I pushed this though the grass and rocky terrain and imanaged quite well.  My daughter didn't seem bothered by it at all.  I just love it.  would recommend to any mother.
B000WOV7WO|5|I love this! I needed a way for my rambuctious 8 month old to move around but stay safe. She can move around within the area I want her to. I don't use the breaks but I will when Ireale my gate down. It works on carpet and great for outside on our driveway. The tray is great and has plenty of things to keep her busy.
B000G6BZJI|3|Product will not stay in place close to the floor if there are baseboards.  Must be positioned above baseboards to stay in place so if you're trying to keep a small pet in place it may not work.
B00067ELGG|5|My son is 6 1/2 months old and is still entranced with this mobile. With the mattress on the lowest setting, and the mobile on the high part of the crib, it lasted much longer than the 5 MO cut off that it advertises.<br /><br />We just took it out of his crib because he can now stand up and grab the lowest animal, but the mobile is so well made that even with his abuse it looks brand new. I was very impressed that he was able to pull on one animal with his full weight, with no damage to the mobile. We took the mobile out of his crib that day, of course.<br /><br />The motor is whisper quiet, but I thought the music, even on low, is loud. I never got tired of hearing the selections. I really liked that you could play an individual song for 15 min, or all three for 15 min. It is a nice change from mobiles that only play one song, for 3-5 min.<br /><br />It was very good at stimulating the baby, but it was not soothing to put him to sleep. You can detach the animals from the music box easily, and I did this during the recent months if it was naptime.<br /><br />Simply for the fact that the music lasts so long, the mobile is worth every penny.
B001QT4AR8|5|Excellent quality!!
B006EVK68K|5|I got these for my grandson and they are fabulous! I love that each pair comes with a reversible design to match any outfit or mood.  They are super soft and that's exactly what I needed for my grandson's delicate, sensitive little hands.  The velcro closure is easy to open and fasten and they stay on his hands really well.
B00M1Y5ANK|5|My baby went from a Britax Chaperone to this one. He loves it so much better, he seems more comfortable in it and now enjoys the car rides!
B0054DZF4Y|5|I bought it for my daughter's day care. We really love it. It has perfect size, good design, soft material. I highly recommend it to everyone who's looking for lunch bags.
B003LNU8PK|3|I was using it with an old wooden high chair and it did work with some extra heavy duty twist ties.
B0006HBS1M|5|I bought this because it makes it easier to express a small amount of milk for mixing with baby food or cereal. Much easier than hand expressing. I would not use it as a primary pump though.
B000F8I59U|5|I got this for my youngest grandson when he was 10 months old. He fooled with it and when he turned 1, he really started beating on it!
B001FOGIZQ|1|I cannot believe that after only a little over a year we had a spring(very sharp) breaking through the surface near a top edge! Our daughter could have been hurt by that if we hadn't seen it in time! I am shocked...Sealy is usually a good mattress!
B00008XL2S|5|WE have about 4 or 5 strollers-but they are all three point and are no challenge for our 1-year old climber.  We bought this to hopefully keep her in the stroller-and it works.  She gets a little aggitated b/c she can't climb out...but it gives us a little piece of mind...which is worth the price that we paid.  It also keeps our 3 year old safely inside too.  This stroller is worth every penny...and more!!!!
B001OC5UMQ|5|The easy step makes it nice going in and out of where you put it, set up is pretty easy, the only complaint is the handles to screw in and out for adjustment need to have a better gripping, it's a little hard screwing it in and out
B001F6YMXE|5|I bought this playard for my son's wife.  They loved that it is easy to open and close.  Once closed it is easy to store in its carry case. It is strudy,easy to carry and  looks great.  My son said that during the baby's first weeks it can double as a crib.  I recommend this playard.
B008D5ZWYS|5|This bib is smaller and is good for smaller children. The snaps are great and you can just wipe them off easily.
B00B507A20|5|This was our upgrade from an infant bucket seat, and wow! It served its purpose, but we should have switched a long time ago. It fits in the centered back seat of our 2010 Honda Civic (facing forward) and is a breeze to install, tighten, adjust, and remove if needed. It is very sturdy and well-designed. Our toddler loves facing forward now and finds it much more comfortable than the infant seat. Getting her buckled in is much easier too, even though our car is pretty small. My only complaint is that the buckling button is a little harder to press when unlocking the straps. The &#34;click&#34; is barely tangible/audible, and it takes more effort. Everything else is wonderfully better than the infant seat.
B000056HNZ|5|I love this breast pump!  FYI...if you have trouble using it with the petal cushion piece in try it without it.  It works better for me without using the petal cushion- works much better, in fact didn't work very well for me using the cushion piece, I couldn't get suction... so I took it out and love it. I too have the Medela Pump in Style which I purchased and used for my last baby and have found it to work fine but hated it for travel- not knowing if my batteries would last or if there would be a plug in available- and the noise!  This time based on a friend's recommendation I purchased the Isis for having an option to hauling the big PIS everywhere.  I love it. I like how easy it is to clean- esp. compared with the PIS- the tubing that milk gets sucked in to all the time- I hate that about the PIS.  This pump works great- great price too!  Highly recommend.
B00B5CBINK|5|Excellent Quality!
B000GB0NZK|5|I bought these from our grocery store for my eleven month old to carry her gold fish around in. they work great. She loves them and takes it everywhere. Occasionally a gold fish will fall out, but not often. We tried Cheerios in it but they skip though the cracks and made a mess, but they work great for goldfish and animal crackers, which are her favorites anyways
B002RSMLEQ|3|it does say colors may vary so i guess they mean it! lol. i wanted the pink and orange but they sent me all green you can this from walmart... i guess its ok its just a bottle but i would have loved the pink and orange i thought it was adorable. but this is the only bottle that I HAVE found that was 11oz and i like the nipples so overall its pretty good. came on time in the mailbox.
B00KFK8DOK|5|If you are looking for a night light companion, this is it!  I have used it since my baby was born and instead of turning the light at night, I use this one and can easily see hen changing her diaper and feeding her. The battery lasts, but you do have to remember to charge it.  I love it!
B0085JHAXI|4|lightweight but the basket is too small and there is no way i can see to wash the covering.glad i was able to purchase this with gift card
B00AVV5DGO|5|Every one of my 4 kids has had a Bunnies By The Bay Blanket Buddy, and all of them have been wonderful.  We buy multiples (just in case) but aside from one that was lost, they are all still intact...and some are now 10+ years old.  Love these and the kids do too.  Even though the kids have had several brands to choose from, they all select the Bunnies by the Bay as their favorites.
B001B26CVW|5|Loved it for my newborn
B000LJJOR0|5|This potty is the sh@# -- my daughter loves this so much.  Never has bye bye pee pee, bye bye poo poo been cuter.  It is sturdy and well built, but would you expect less from a Sesame Street product.  The clarity of the Elmo voice is perfect, too.
B00F3J2TOI|5|Use these as a burp rag and to lay over the baby in the bath. Very good quality and a great size!
B004C43JIK|5|MY DARLING 4 MONTH OLD GRANDSON LOVES HIS BOUNCY CHAIR.  HE IS NOW ENJOYING FOLLOWING HIS MOMMY ALL OVER YET SHE IS HANDS FREE AND CAN DO HER WORK AND HE CAN SIT AND PLAY AND WATCH HER.
B003H4QFPA|5|We recieved this stroller as a gift and have been grateful ever since.  It rides extremely smoothly and is easy to control.  The swivel front wheel is critcal to being able to make turns and navigate through neighborhoods, parks, and crowds of people.  The seat reclines all the way down which made it possible for us to use right away.  We simply got a head support and took our newborn baby for walks around the neighborhood.  The wheels are very rugged and great for jogging through various terrains.  The canopy has great coverage and easily blocks the sun from our baby, and the rain canopy is a great bonus so we can contine to take her out in all kinds of weather.  The storage under the stroller is very roomy and can easily hold a diaper bag plus extra.  It folders up very well and easily fits in the trunk of our sudan without taking up all the trunk space.
B000ICZ9Y2|5|I wish these had been around when my kids were babies! I suspect my granddaughter will get a lot of use from this when she starts teething. In the meantime, she likes the bright colors.
B0091E31KM|5|Best sound machine! Comes in sliver too
B000WEHO76|5|Such a great invention.  So quick, easy, and not messy at all (well, as much as babies aren't messy :-))  Love it!
B001MS82HM|2|I got this pump because it was the least expensive and it worked really good for about the first couple of weeks but if you are expecting to pump a lot then you shouldn't buy this pump....It takes about 30 min. just to pump 2 oz. it's ridiculous and gets really frustrating so I wouldn't waste my money if I were you!
B001CFACMI|4|For those nay-sayers may I remind them this is a suction cup.  When treated like a suction cup and not a holder that is screwed to the wall it works great.  I have a fiberglass shower enclosure and I cleaned a  spot with alcohol and also wiped the suction cup with it..then wet both....held it to the wall and moved the arm as instructied to make the suction.  It has been in that spot since I first put it there and I use it daily. This holder is well made...sturdy..and I look forward to a long and happy relationship.  Adend:  I just received my second holder for another shower...I am still completely satisfied and it really has long term holding power.
B000G6BZJI|4|Grand-dog loves to visit, but gets very excited upon arrival. Had installed new carpet upstairs so this gate saves a lot of hassle cleaning up after the pooch. Provides a very secure off-limits barrier.
B001WAJVZM|5|Great. No more bumps in their heads.  Lovely
B009YSYCZI|1|I'm having enormous difficulty in using this pump.  For some reason, there is a difference in suction between one side when compared to the other.  Even when I switch the pumps over and change breasts, I encounter the same issue on the other breast.  This was frustrating as it meant my double electric pump effectively became a single electric pump!<br /><br />Today I tried using the pump again and now both sides are not demonstrating enough suction.  The 'let down' faze works correctly, but then as you go to the other settings, there isn't enough suction to extract milk.  So even on the highest setting, there isn't enough suction to even get a mL of milk!  My husband and I have checked all the components, fitting and refitting the seals, diaphragm and cords, and can't figure out why this is occurring!<br /><br />I'm going back to work shortly and I'm exasperated by the fact that I can't even build up my storage, let alone prepare for work in 2 weeks!  I live in Thailand and ordered the pump to my sister in Australia.  I was so excited to be able to have the latest model.  I've contact Philips in Bangkok and they forwarded me onto a different baby company who I didn't buy the product through!  The retail price here to replace my Avent is 4 times the cost on Amazon so now I'm in a real pickle!
B00HI78LUY|5|This item was way cuter in person. It is doubling as my hospital bag as well. Very happy with this purchase.
B008K4GMOG|5|My 8 month old grandaughter really enjoys these.  They are colorful, bright and light weight.  Fit well in her tiny hands and help with her teething.  Though we havent put them in the tub yet.  will have to keep an eye on these when she gets teeth so no pieces come off.
B000GKW8EA|5|The bag held the BOB safely and securely and had extra space to add things such as babywipes and babyfood. I was a little concerned that it would subject us to oversize charges but it did not.  Before buying this, I tried to locate a similar bag that would fit the stroller but was unsuccessful.  Overall, it was a good purchase and traveled well.
B005I4I0UK|4|I ordered the Kalencom Ozz Coated Diaper Bag, O'Stripes, when it was on special.  I don't know if they were just out of them when I ordered and thought I wouldn't notice, but they sent a smaller bag in the same stripe.  I didn't send it back for two reasons.  One, I really needed a diaper bag, and two, the price I paid was still less than what the smaller bag would cost at full retail price, so I didn't lose money.  If I had, I would've been ticked.  I gave it four stars because the diaper bag I received is really well made.  As it is, I have a diaper bag that works for me (although it doesn't have the bottle bag in it) and it was still a decent deal.
B00EHCGFD8|5|Great thermal bag.  i've only used it for cold stuff but it keeps stuff cold or frozen for longer than I expected.  I bought more bags.<br />Great for in the car and much easier to handle and carry than heavier coolers.  Very very pleased with this product.
B003T1CJRE|5|This is a Great product!  Would order again! Arrived on time and was just as described. Would recommend to others.
B004HFQLKW|5|PROS:<br />1. This is easy to use - just pour water to the line, add the amount of formula and push button twice.  We didn't need to read the manual.<br />2. It does make perfect formula each time.<br />3. You can warm pre-made/previously made stuff.<br />4. It takes only about three long whiney cries to warm/make so the baby is not waiting forever.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. You have to remember to drop that little spin thing into it each time which can be touch in the middle of the night and half asleep.  Ruined many batches at 4am...<br />2. You have to wash it piece (lid, steel cup and spin thing) each time.  Wish they provided an extra steel cup thing.<br /><br />I have NO idea what people are complaining about.  This thing is AWESOME.
B002K5C4TI|2|Really?<br />Sort of frustrating that the pictures shown of the product are green and yellow. Colors may vary? Pink and pink and pink were the colors I got.
B001LOOSWU|1|I ordered 2 types of favors: one for all my friends (rocking horse, made in Italy) for $2.20. And also the timer, for all people who took care of the baby shower, for $5.00. The former is a statue and does not do anything, my intention was to give my friends something useful: however, the timer does not work at all... Too expensive for a nice package
B00ICUG3U6|5|We really love this seat! It's small enough to leave extra room for an adult to sit in the back of our small Toyota Pruis. It's the only booster we've been able to find that truly is the slimmest, safest possible. Some people mentioned having to blow it up all the time but we have had it for a year and haven't had to blow it up. If you have a lot of trouble early on, may want to send it back. Great seat, would buy again and again!
B009SXIKD4|5|Cute Mobile matches a jungle theme room.  This is one of the only mobiles I found with a Zebra in in it which was key to our room.
B000I5H5JQ|4|I own the Medela contact nipple shield too, but I like this one better because it adheres to the skin on the breast better than the cut out contact version.  I have very short nipples, and sometimes my son would throw a fit when he has trouble latching.  The shield is a good option for those with short nipples (and no, not everyone's nipples get longer with sucking)
B000V3IIH8|4|This product works and the child likes it but it tends to make her fall backwards when the line tightens.  I don't know if this can be avoided and it is better than her getting lost when we go to the mall.
B00081J3N6|5|I had previous purchased a pack of 'safety first' outlet covers.  My under a year old son, took those domes right out, we had them all over the floor! We needed a working product and I threw the box away.<br />-------<br />That said, these are a wonderful outlet cover.  They are almost adult proof too and that is what you need for baby proofing. These are flat and difficult to remove and I bought the larger pack to share with grandma's house too.<br />Someone asked about fitting in older homes, absolutely. I have had no problems with a variety of outlets.<br />These are totally safe and though my little guy has tried his hardest, they are not coming out!
B000BNQC58|5|Again, grandson loved this
B00KJBYREK|5|As described.  Very good!  Thanks.
B002MFV7J4|5|My daughter is very careful about the plastic toys she permits for my granddaughter.  I was really glad to find this toy, made of all natural materials, and no industrial plastics.
B00C870102|5|This is our second Britax double stroller.  Great for twins.  Very durable, yet light.  We use it everywhere - Have not had any problems getting through doors.
B003F0MJ06|1|I used it only once so far. It is not sticky at all. My baby keep removing it from table. Very disappointed.
B00CP7OWG4|5|Fit the carseat perfectly!!!
B006ZISQWK|5|Pro-<br />Adorable for girls<br />The build quality is good<br />Our daughter enjoys the cup holder and dip in the tray that helps her to pick up items<br /><br />Cons-<br />None<br /><br />We have not traveled with this item yet.  I had read that this was not the best for that so we shall see.
B00D4LFDYA|5|Just got it and it looks great I thought from the picture it would be really small but I am very happy on the size and it has a lot of room:) I'm excited to try it out very soon on my next family outing.
B003AJHDQW|5|Have yet to test their absorbency but they fluffed up just like the manufacturer said they would...
B002VPCQCW|5|Each color emits a different amount of brightness, so you should be able to find one that suits your needs.  Red is the lowest brightness and we leave it on that setting for sleeping during the night.  The blue and green lights provide the perfect amount of light for diaper changes in the middle of the night.
B00AHP1UTI|5|These are very convenient for our family of 9. They come in a nice baby scent and although are made for babies the whole family uses them. All of us have sensitive skin, but there have been no issues with anyone.
B0012XRTK8|5|We love the lopsy lamb blanket. I was nervous about introducing a blanket or toy because we strictly followed the safe sleep guidelines. However,our 10 month old baby started waking up at night and needed something to help him go back to sleep. After talking to many nurses and pediatricians we decided to get this lamb blanket. He loves how soft the lamb is and the smooth satin belly-side. He started sleeping through the night again....happy baby, happy parents!
B008ESOV4Q|4|Small in size and there are no hooks for non-tile surfaces
B0000DEW8N|5|I keep my 7 month old grandson a lot and couldn't decide if I needed a high chair or a booster seat.  This booster seat is all I needed.  When he's not eating in it, he loves to play with his toys in it.  I put it in a bar stool chair which makes it high chair height.  This is all you need and cheaper.  Very sturdy too.  Great booster seat!!!
B000I679Z0|5|ok
B0009PAN7Q|5|This potty seat (toilet trainer) works great for us. It's the only one we could find that adjusts to fit the toilet seat & stays in place. HIghly recommended!
B0002ZOIC4|5|I just got this swing on sale this weekend.  What a deal!  I have an in home daycare and this swing is wonderful.  Bright colors, the songs are great, and the birds are so cute!  It wasn't difficult to put together either.  I would recommend this swing!
B00067X0PY|3|We bought this stroller because consumer reports gave it a good rating and we loved the sporty color of the Metalica color scheme.  Also, we were looking for a light-weight compact stroller.  I know this is a long review, but after spending major $$$, I think it's important to share my experience.  We have used it for about 10mths now.    (PROS)  The stroller is very lightweight, compact, folds like an umbrella with the canopy, full recline (great for an infant or a sleeping older baby), sturdy, nice fabric, and looks very sleek. It does come with a parent cup holder & has a cup holder/snack tray for the baby.     (Note)  This stroller is compact = very small basket underneath, no storage space near handles (like to keep a wallet or keys). So, if these features are very important to you, then this may not be the stroller for you.    (CONS)  (1) Also, the stroller cannot be opened and closed with one hand. There is just no way around it.  (2) It's hard to explain - but the harness is not fixed to the back seat, instead it is removable.  Just yesterday the `cloth piece' that holds the harness in place actually came off.  I called Peg Perego customer service.  They said, \\"the `cloth piece' is not meant to hold the harness while the child is sitting in the stroller nor is it meant to help restrain her/him.\\"  They continue to say, \\"the `cloth piece' is only there to keep the straps of the harness out of the way while putting the baby in the stroller.\\"  So in essence this is a 3-Point Harness or a 'Floating' 5-Point Harness.  I bought the stroller thinking it was a 5-Point Harness (that is what their web-site states).  I asked if they could fix it but I was told it was considered an `Upholstery' issue and that `Upholstery' on their strollers are covered for 90 days and not 1 year.  So, I took it to a nearby tailor and got is sewn back on for about $8.    **  If I were to give a new mom advice on buying a stroller.  It would be to get one with a good 5 point harness, all other features are just personal preferences.  A 5 point harness is not a standard on strollers as it is on car seats.  But, I think they should be. It is much safer to have a 5 point harness to keep the child secure in the stroller. **    ***  If a true \\"5 point harness\\" and a true \\"one hand open/close\\" are really important to you.  Check out the Zippy by Inglesina.  It is very similar to the Peg Perego Pliko but does not have a parent cup holder, no child snack tray/cup holder, and does not fold with the canopy on. ***    **** No mater what stroller you decide on, if possible, check it out at the store - open and close it yourself, lift it up to make sure you can lift it, test out all the features you are looking for, etc. ****
B00ACR8LCU|5|Fit my 5'7, 155lb frame perfectly.  Baby loves it too.  MUCH better than the MOBY and BOBA wraps I tried.  The fabric is a bit heavy, but still so much easier to use than the MOBY and BOBA.  I do have the sturdier BOBA carrier and love it...but for soft wraps - this is the way to go.  My newborn loved being held close...and he REALLY liked it once he could hold his head up, keep his arms and legs out!!
B00AANPUUM|5|I like the sturdiness of this. It is ceramic not plastic so it looks nice. I got compliments on how cute it was on my tree. Also, I had no problem getting it personalized like some of the other reviewers. The price is lower than I had expected to pay for the quality. Nice!
B000YFR8YW|3|OK first off the bad review above mine she obviously didnt read Mini/portable crib.  This bumper is for a prtable crib with measurements of 40 x 26 x 38 so of course it wouldnt fit a full size crib. So dont get leary if you want this for a mini crib :)
B001CWR8NW|5|The material is beautiful and the frog prints are so adorable. I totally love these sheets and will be buying them again
B00TXZ5LLQ|5|Love how it looks in my baby's bedroom. Colors are lovely.
B0077DYLXA|5|Bought as a gift.
B003V9PXE0|4|They worked well for the 8 oz bottles of similac formula.
B003I867US|5|Quality item. Works great, just have to get used to putting it on, once you've mastered that its a breeze. Simple enough that you can use with little or no assistance getting baby in.
B00DK6OO5I|5|Adorable. Our granddaughter will love it.
B007NG5UF4|5|My Dad had a stroke. Since bringing him home from the rehab center I've been having to get up very 1-2hrs to check on him thru out the day & night. I tried getting cordless phone with the walkie talkie feature, but he's just not understanding it. This has been great. If he needs me he just calls out. The parent unit has a walkie talkie like button that allows me to ask him what he needs without having to stop what I'm doing and walk across the house. I can now get more hours of sleep. My Mom loves how clearly both sides can be understood. It also has a sensitivity level. Which has been a life savor, bcs I can't sleep with my Dad's snoring as ambient noise. So it can be set to stay quite until a certain noise level is reached and then it can be set to vibrate to wake me up.
B002BRYD1C|3|I LOVE the fabric. Its a little bulky but is a fantastic night time cover. I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would make a wool cover with applix... but hey that's just me. I converted mine to snaps. Both ways it fit poorly. I added hip snaps to it and it helped with the fit. I recommend Nicki wraps in cotton or wool instead :) Organic Caboose also makes a great fleece cover with a similar build as far as the center of the body goes.
B0045I6IAY|5|We use nothing but soothies right now and our daughter loves them. Unfortunately, we keep losing them. LOL
B00EEYZCTC|5|Fresh out of the box, this unit comes in 2 major pieces.  There are no screws or other hardware involved in installation.  You will not need a screwdriver, unless you're like me and need help opening the box.<br /><br />The pieces lock firmly together with an audible snap.  When you tuck it under the mattress, the guard rail ends up sitting on top of the mattress, rather than beside it.  To lock it in place, you press it down until the indicator display shows that it's locked.  When in place, it is very firm and solid.  It locks on to the mattress over the bedding, so making the bed afterwards will not look smooth and tucked in because this unit is on top of the bed.  Not beside it.<br /><br />Build quality is high.  The materials all look and feel sturdy enough to function well for the purpose intended.  It is very nice that there is no gap between the gate and the bed.  The only hassle is that you have to make the bed around it, unless you want to unlock it long enough to get everything tucked in.  Then you'll have to re-lock it when you need to use it.  Unlocking it is easy enough to do.  You press a button on each side to release the tension.<br /><br />Neutral color scheme.
B005PBPMKW|5|Nice diapers bag<br />great price
B008KOC0R4|5|I received a set of these for my new granddaughter.  When she first started to grab and hold things, these were the best!!  She could hold them with no trouble, and loved the tags and loops on the edges.  Of course, she &#34;ate&#34; them all, and they are completely machine washable.  She explored the textures, and loved the crinkly sounds of some.  I searched, and found them on Amazon Target, and bought 2 more sets for gifts!
B00008YSRN|5|As a first time mom I made sure to have several different bottle brands to try not knowing which ones would be best. Not only does the bottle's design greatly reduce spit up but the nipples allow for just the right flow. I have had no leaking problems with travelling because they include travel disks with them that eliminate any problems.
B002WB2G9I|5|I purchased this stroller to use for a week long trip to Walt Disney. I checked this stroller at the gate at the airport. I specifically purchased this because of the drink holder, light weight, sun shade and basket underneath.  There is a holder for drinks and other small belongings with a zippered pocket to hold (cellphone, keys, wallet, etc) that was very nice. The basket underneath is small and doesn't accommodate a large bag or backpack, but we didn't mind as the stroller was sturdy enough to hold a lightweight backpack slipped over the handles without tipping over when our son wasn't in the stroller. We put several water bottles in the basket underneath and the sun shade was a life saver for not only the sun, but when it started pouring rain on my sleeping 2-year old! (And us). The 50 lb limit is generous in comparison to other umbrella strollers. The foam over the handles eases comfort in pushing. It put together very easy, it folds and goes up just as simply. The look and style of the stroller is modern and chic. Would highly recommend it to all my friends and beyond with little ones!
B003I5YY1A|5|We have been using these cups for a while now with our daughter.  We like that they don't leak even if she drops them.  You can also remove the valve to make them free flowing cups as the kids grow older.  They clean easily in the dish washer on the top rack.  Overall good purchase.
B009ES16GG|5|Perfect gift, great quality!
B00BI0FFL0|4|So far this pocket diaper has done nicely.  My baby boy is 9 months old and eats solids and this contains his bowel movements nicely.  I like the outer shell, the color has held up so far.  I also like the rainbow snaps to help with lining up the diaper correctly.  I Have yet to use this as a night time diaper but the microfiber insert has held up well.  I am okay with the snap-in insert but don't like the fact that it is at the front of the diaper, the less I have to touch urine the better the yuck factor.
B0009RNXNA|4|we have a britax marathon 70 and this bag is surprisingly tight around the sides.  we filled the seat with other items as recommended by others, used it on a trip successfully but signs of slight rips on top flap already.  good bag for the price
B0018EFGGU|5|so glad to find replacements.  sure beats buying new cups everytime my son chews thru a tip.  happy to use
B00G3XR7DG|4|A versatile and sturdy stroller. Only complaint is the compartment for diaper bag below the seat is very small.
B00PHWNLKM|4|It's a bit loud but it's perfect for my LO! Definitely recommend. I have it strapped to the crib so I can play music in his room.
B001WAJVZM|5|I'm pretty happy with this spout cover.  I do agree with the other reviewers that it will only stay in place if you have a shower diverter on your spout. I like that the cover extends past the bottom of the faucet, so when my son hit his head on it while trying to stand in the bath, it didn't hurt him (it's very hard keeping my tiny guy still in the bath).
B00CWN8IK2|1|I got this a few months ago and used it twice and its horrible. It doesn't work at all now. No mist comes out the top and it leaks from the base. Save your money!
B000JSYTU0|5|My husband and I agreed: if we had to choose one item that we really couldn't do without since having our baby 2 months ago, it's our Moby wrap!<br /><br />Our first week home from the hospital, we were able to go out to lunch with the baby wrapped up and completely covered in the Moby. It's given us a sense of freedom that we never thought we could have once she was born, because we can comfortably take her anywhere that we want to go. I can't count how many times I've gone out to eat or shopping with her wrapped up on me!<br /><br />It might be because she's so used to it now, but it's so comfortable for her, she falls asleep almost immediately once she's in it. And, perhaps even more importantly, my husband and I can both wear her in it for hours on end without any back pain. I use it at least once a day, just around the house, when she's getting overtired or overstimulated... She fights me for a second, and then falls right to sleep.<br /><br />It's easy to use once you've done it a couple of times... Getting the feel for the perfect tightness takes about a week of using it. Once you figure out that sweet spot, though... It's just perfect.<br /><br />We also have an Ergo carrier with an infant insert, and even though the Ergo might be a little more sturdy for walking long distances, our baby really doesn't like it nearly as much, and it's really not as comfortable as the Moby.
B0083973FK|5|so far so good, LO hasnt leaked out of her diaper since we got these
B0035JL92Q|2|I ordered these by mistake - I wanted the nylon (which I would recommend). I didn't use them or even bother to try them because the leg holes do not have any material to protect your lil ones legs.  It is just a tiny thin piece of elastic on the inside (against the child's skin) stitched to the vinyl which didn't look as if it would hold up very long. I am only rating the design quality of this product.
B0057MXB5M|5|works well
B00AHVR94W|5|Really nice booster seat! I wish there were more color options, but this seat has a good amount of padding to it. It is a bit wider than other boosters I've had, but in our van it does not matter. Its very nice it has the anchors on it, so it's even safer. My son really likes it, so I do too :)
B007UMHW3Y|5|Our son really enjoys his friend Benbat. He calls him Brownie. He is 5 and I like how Benbat keeps the seatbelt from rubbing into the side of his neck. I also like you can remove it from one vechile to another if need to be. I will highly recommand this to any one who has a small child that sets in booster seat.
B000I5T3T6|4|The high chair is fine although I rarely use it.  I think that it was a little costly -- but I guess you have to pay for the toy that sits on top of the tray.  I have no compliants -- it is a really nice chair and I am certain, the older my daughter (currently 6 months old) the more use I will get out of the chair.
B00260GN0I|1|If you are looking for a non-skid pad, do not buy this item.  It is not as advertised.  And lacking the non-skid botom, there is no compelling reason to purchase this pad over the others available to you.
B0018725CU|1|This is the worst bath product it floats around like a pool float unless your only putting 2 inches of water in the tub and if you do that then theres no water touching the baby! HORRIBLE
B004AHKUHM|5|Very nice product very light. Very sensitive when next to baby, can grab her small noise from even 2-3 feet away.<br /><br />I live in a condo area and we have 0 static in 3+1 apartment complex.
B000YZ4OVW|5|Great for the price. Looks adorable in my daughter's nursery. For the price, you can't beat it. It's a bed skirt at the end of the day, I didn't think it necessary to purchase a 100$ bed skirt. Looks perfect.
B008RCFNDM|5|Our ~9 month old started leaking through every concoction I could put together for a night time cloth diaper around 6 months. We started to have to use disposables at night. I bought four of these and they have been brilliant so far. Not one leak. He is still using the small setting folded down. It took me a while to figure out how to fold it because it is different from most adjustable cloth diapers. You have to lay the diaper out flat with the pooters sign facing up, and then fold the top part (with all of the buttons) down to snap into the two snaps for the smaller setting. He has plenty of room to grow with these and he doesn't even need any of the additional inserts yet. I use a Flips cover over them and a fleece liner inside.
B005ZBI04W|1|I bought this because our son's other tub was a little slippery and we didn't want him to fall in the water.  This tub is VERY slippery, so be careful if you do decide to buy.  I feel like I wasted my money on a dangerous product.  We tried the suction cup things on the bottom so our son wouldn't slip, but the cheap material of the tub, they wouldn't stay on.
B000Q7HL68|5|I don't know why but I think little kid suitcases are just so cute.  My boys never had one, but since girls tend to carry a lot of stuff around with them, I figured Olivia would like one.  Whether it be for a weekend at grandma's, using as a carry-on for a flight or just to carry around toys, the Trunki by Melissa and Doug is absolutely adorable!  It is a kid-sized suitcase perfect for little ones to pack all their necessities (and of course toys) and they can even ride it as a pull-along riding toy.<br /><br />Features:<br />Airline carry on approved<br />Suitable for kids to ride on (while scooting themselves or a parent pulling them with the included strap)<br />Sturdy-hard shell<br />Available in fun colors<br />5 gallon capacity<br />Has straps to secure items inside<br />Locks (use included and attached plastic key to open)<br />Lightweight<br />Measures:  18.25\\" x 8.63\\" x 12\\"<br /><br />Honestly the Trunki is the perfect size for kids.  Now while I have read some reviews about it not holding much, I was skeptical at how much I could actually fit in it.  I was able to fit a weekends worth of outfits and pjs for Olivia, some toys and I stil had room.  Now yes her clothes are small, but I also think as she gets older her clothes may get bigger but her toys won't be as bulky.  I definitely see this being useful from birth (of course the child can't ride it though until he/she is 3 years old) through at least 7 years old.  The suitcase is that hard plastic-shell material so it can stand up to traveling-use and it really fits a decent amount if you pack it right.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend the Trunki for any young child who wants a suitcase (or carrying bag) of their own.  It is just too cute to pass up and there isn't anything I don't like about it.  I love too that it is airline approved for use as a carryon so when we do go on a flight with the kids, at least one of us will have a fashionable and functional suitcase.  With the included carrying strap you can also pull your child (gently of course) through the airport because we all know how tired their little legs can get.  Overall, we love the Trunki and know we will get our use out of it.p you can also pull your child (gently of course) through the airport because we all know how tired their little legs can get.

B002UD65XQ|5|This product arrived on time and it was just what I wanted. My daughter arrived two weeks early, so I had to go pick one up at a local store. The quality of that one is not as good as this one. I would order it again.
B003IHVHLI|5|i bought this for the Maclaren stroller  as they don' t have a big basket to keep all the things when going for walks, it really works and the pink color is nice!
B0016L0MMS|5|My child was potty training this summer and refused to pee in the water at the beach, so this was our solution!  We used a plastic bag underneath to catch anything solid.  If you're going to use this a lot, I'd probably find something that has a better waste receptacle, this is truly just a frame.
B006SFUEF2|1|Let me say the sound works great still on this second one. The. Ishtar light, too. It all worked fine for a few months then the projector stopped spinning. Now the projector and sound can't be on at the same time. Ugh. Oh, well, as long as the rain noise  keeps working I'm happy.
B004HJS6MO|4|its cheaply made and i see what people are saying about the battery door not matching up, but my gf loves it and so does our daughter. if they put another few bucks in making it and everything was slightly better made id give it 5 stars. i got lucky i guess and got a working one tho.
B00LXT2L0Y|3|Cute design and makes interesting sounds. However, the buttons are hard for a one year old to press. My daughter still loves when I press them for her, but that doesn't make for a great infant/toddler toy.
B00H8MSEWY|5|Fantastic car seat!!!  I would suggest you have a local police station install the seat. There is much more to installation than meets the eye.
B0002ZOI9W|4|This chair is great!  At first it was a little big for my newborn but he started to like it more and more as he got bigger!  Hes now 14 months old and still uses this chair! He loves to sit in it while he watches cartoons etc. A definate great buy!  When he was a little younger he loved the toybar, but has no use for it now.
B001UAFBYE|3|Bought this diaper bag because I wanted one with an adjustable strap that could also be slung over the handle on my stroller. It is smaller than a typical diaper bag, so if you only have 1 child to pack for or you are going on a quick trip that doesn't require a lot of baby items, this bag is for you. It only held a few diapers (pampers size 4), a pack of wipes, a sippy cup and my wallet. If I put anything else in the bag, it wouldn't close. Also, if you over stuff the inside or side pockets, it takes away from space inside the bag to use. I bought this right before finding out I was expecting again. Now I have a bigger diaper bag more equipped to handle the needs of two kids under 2. We now use this bag for toys in the car, or for keeping extra diapers, wipes, and outfits in the car for an emergency need.
B00A0ID90A|5|This Potty was perfect for my little boy! I wanted something simple without all the sounds and distractions- lightweight but sturdy, this is it! Great price too. Thank you for a great product!
B009HAUA8Q|5|This is exactly what I wanted. Thanks! Came as described and shipped fast!
B00G2E4G3A|2|May be it will work better for other kids, but our little explorer never used it as shown at video. He skiped all this cool ideas and kept spoiling all aroud the plate.
B0067GKHQS|4|I really like this. One point to improve IMHO is to make the weight holder a bit heavier and perhaps the container itself as it moves around just a bit.
B00GR4SXRA|5|As always wubbanub to the rescue. :) My friends newborn loves it. There is no chasing the bike constantly with these!
B001TRE216|4|We bought two of these for my 2 year old twins when I had a third baby.  I did NOT want to buy a minivan, so when I found the Coccoro I was elated.  We fit two of these and a Graco Snugride in my Hyundai Santa Fe.  When my baby turns one and can sit forward facing, we'll get a third Coccoro.    I took one star off for color choices.  We got one Cherry Pie and one Strawberry Shake.  Both are beautiful, but the Strawberry Shake is filthy after just 2 months of use.  I would have rather had a grey or other dark color that hides some of the dirt.  The Cherry Pie color is a little better, since it's dark.
B004J35DR4|5|This product works great and easy to set up. Sets up with the bed and very stable. I would recommend this product to everyone with a new baby.
B00AZWDJKG|5|we have 2 of these and they're my favorite cup for my daughters snacks in the car. The screw on lid is why I like them so much. All the other snack cups we have she can get the kids off which defeats the purpose of a travel snack cup so these are perfect. They hold a good amount of food for a toddler. Probably going to buy more haha.
B0051EZD4I|5|Great storage for kids toys. Only negative some have minor flaws, but can't beat the price. They also fit together quickly & fit a second one great.
