B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie in a way is like a Usual Suspects type of movie, in that you can keep going back and find clues that you didn't see before.  Everyone knows the plot so I am just gonna give some of my thoughts after watching it.  1) I don't think this is a best picture film, more of a trendsetting film that Independent Filmakers will begin to copy.  2) Best Directed film of 2001  3) You have to watch this movie a few times to appreciate it.  4) Guy Pearce is a pretty darn good actor, his performance is similar to that given by Christian Bale in American Psycho.  The DVD also has some features that go into more depth about Leonard's Background, which were hinted at during the movie, but 99 percent of us missed, even if you saw this movie 5 times, just buy it for the special features.....overall, great movie<br />A
B000001E21|5.0|Five stars just aren't enough for Pyromania, Hysteria and Retroactive. Most of the songs on Retroactive were written during the \\"Hysteria B-side sessions.\\" Def Leppards B-sides are better than most groups' A-sides. Believe me you'll love this one.
B000002BUY|5.0|This CD is so damn good!  When I listen to this CD, it gives me the feeling like I'm visiting another plane of existance.  If that makes me sound insane, I assure you that I am quite a stable individual.  This CD to me is like a harder version of Pink Floyd.  What I mean by that is simply this:  it's like audio acid.  You can trip out to it while being completely sober. It's so funky and melodic at the same time.  Perfect blend of hard rock, funk, and some hip hop elements.   Stand out tracks include:<br />Redefine<BR>Glass<BR>Certain Shade of Green<BR>Calgone<br />If you've never heard this CD, I recommend you download the samples from amazon.com
0671027344|5.0|In an amazing novel, Stephen Chbosky writes as a young man named Charlie. Charlie is fifteen and terribly blessed with a gift for written word.<br /> Though introduced as a coming-of-age novel, I'd like to think it is more of a coming-into-torture-and-somehow-surviving novel. <br /> Charlie's story is written through letters to an unknown &quot;friend&quot;. They take us through his freshman year of high-school, starting in August and ending the next August. Charlie sees the world through his eyes, never changing. In attempts at finding a sort of peace in the busy world of his home life-he finds himself friends with an older crowd. Through time, he becomes an important part of the world, reading and writing as if they were luxeries, not habit.<br /> Chbosky takes the reader on a journey of being alone. The characters are real, the writing is that of a fifteen year old's thoughts and words.<br /> All in all, a tremendous book of the outside world looking in.
B00005NW02|5.0|Ok first thing is first, this album ROCKS!!!!! It carries the same intensity Lyrical talent and musical craziness as the self-titled. In my opinion this is one of the top three most anticipated albums, along with Slipknot's &quot;IOWA&quot; Tool's &quot;Lateralus&quot; and Slayer's &quot;God Hates Us All&quot;. One of these  will undeniably be album of the year. Best songs on Toxicity: All of them PERIOD.
B00003CX8J|3.0|This movie, quite frankly, was a disappointment. It had great actors (Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart), a halfway decent plot and good special effects. So what's my problem? I didn't actually CARE about any of the characters...It fails on the gut level. Part of the problem is that the movie is very short, so there is no room for real character development.<br />I'm comparing this movie to the Michael Keaton Batman flicks. Now THAT's how you turn a comic book into a movie! This is closer to Batman Returns (which I give 2 stars) than to Batman (5 stars).<br />Rent, don't buy. (I unfortunately bought the DVD without having seen the flick. Wanna buy mine?)
B000021YQV|4.0|...and I like the band.  But I don't think this album will win them many new fans.  It's really short (44min) and, while the sound quality is still really good, most of the songs sound a bit unpolished.  Some songs (like &quot;Bounce&quot;) sound like experimentation (&quot;pogopogopogopogo&quot; as percussion?), and a couple (&quot;Jet Pilot&quot; I think it's called and &quot;X&quot;) are pretty valueless, even obnoxious, as far as I can tell.  &quot;Chop Suey&quot; stands out as the most polished song, I think; none of the others seem as tight, well thought-out.<br />I think they tried to tackle more concrete, literal subject matter (&quot;Prison Song&quot; being the best), but they still sound so paranoid that I can't take the lyrics too literally...  not that that's a bad thing.<br />I think there's still too much repetitive yelling, but there are more melodic, mellow, harmonious bits which are my favorite parts of the album.  Besides &quot;Chop Suey,&quot; I think &quot;Atwa&quot; and &quot;Toxicity&quot; (which has been going through my head) stand out.<br />I don't think this CD is as good as the debut (where I'd say the best songs were &quot;Suite-Pee&quot; and &quot;Spiders&quot;), but I'm still happy to have something new from SOAD.  I hope they put out a third album a little faster, though...
0790729644|5.0|This is my favorite western of all time. An oscar-caliber cast, smart writing, action that makes sense and real drama all wrapped into one! Great.<br />At the heart, this is the story of a ruthless gunslinger with a touch of tenderness in his cold, black heart. That dichotomy, and tension, between Eastwood's good and bad sides are at war in this movie, and the end result is riveting. <br />The DVD by the way looks and sounds great, with few frills. This is a must-have in any collection. Buy, don't rent!
B00000JJQK|5.0|Undeniably the Beach Boys masterpiece. This is an album that has transcended the years and will still be played and enjoyed hundreds of years from now. Brian Wilson, inspired by The Beatles &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album, set to work, along with some help from Tony Asher to create one of the most amazing pop records ever made. The digital remastering is excellent,...these songs sound wonderful. And the 24 page book is great. Includes notes by Brian Wilson, loads of photos, track-by-track notes, and a 6 page essay by David Leaf on The Beach Boys and the making of this album. My version has 3 bonus tracks &quot;Unreleased Backgrounds&quot;, &quot;Hang on to Your Ego&quot; and &quot;Trombone Dixie&quot;. This album belongs in all good music collections.
0345403959|3.0|Look, you don't read David Eddings for classic literature, you read him for the cool sorcery, the sharply drawn characters and a sense of humor.<br />Belgarath the Sorcerer delivers, but it's definitely of the meat and potatoes variety. It's a trip down memory lane for those who have waded through the Belgariad and the Mallorean (which both became progressively more ponderous and lacking in new ideas).<br />The fact that this book even exists suggests that Mr. Eddings is running either a bit low on new ideas, or his bank account, or both.
B000002KBD|5.0|The first time someone tried to play this album for me, I was really reluctant to listen. It was the early seventies, a few years after the album came out, and the Van Morrison song that was getting the most radio play at the time was TB Sheets. Brilliant song, but harrowing Ð certainly not something you want to listen to every day. So when my friend said he was going to put on a Van Morrison album, I said, &quot;This is going to be painful, isnÕt it?&quot;<br />Before the first song (Domino) was over, I knew I was wrong. This has got to be the most joyous album ever made. That great old Biblical phrase &quot;a joyful noise&quot; is the only way to describe it. ItÕs not a sappy, moon-June kind of happiness. I keep thinking of a line from Blue Money. He sings, &quot;YouÕre so glad to be alive, honey.&quot; ThatÕs the spirit that courses through this album. It sounds like a man who has been deep down in the blues (the man who sang about TB sheets, I guess) and came up laughing and smiling and singing his heart out. <br />If youÕve listened to any later Morrison albums, you know that joy didnÕt remain in much of his music. But at least weÕve got this album. Even the most pensive song on the CD Ð IÕll Be Your Lover Too Ð is warm and contented, full of quiet joy. Most of the songs on here really do make you glad to be alive.<br />IÕve heard His Band and The Street Choir described as a &quot;minor&quot; Moondance Ð the same rich and soulful horns, the same jazz feel, but without the lyrical depth. Maybe. ItÕs true thereÕs not a song here with the poetry of  Into the Mystic or And It Stoned Me (both from Moondance), but pure, unadulterated happiness is nothing to turn up your nose at. Owning this album really is like owning a little chunk of joy.

014100018X|4.0|This is a lovely book to read, full of delightful characters and thoroughly evil bad guys, set in a picturesque French village.  If you have seen the movie, which is equally delightful, you get the picture, though be warned, some of the characters and scenarios have changed a little on the big screen.<br />If you like chocolate, you will of course like this book.  The descriptions of Vianne's wares are just like standing in a chocolate shop and I suppose that these goodies are the real characters in the book.  It really does evoke the passion of chocolate, and how it can change a life, and even an entire community.<br />If I have a small criticism of the book, it is that it is a little predictable, but then again so is the taste of a good chocolate, and we never let that get in the way!  Enjoy!
6305558167|3.0|A pretty good Arthurian flick, but doesn't live up the 4.5 star rating average on Amazon. The acting is pretty good (especially Merlin), but Arthur is a bit lame, IMHO. There are several nude scenes, so it's probably not something you want to watch with the kiddies.<BR>And, at, times, it feels a little ponderous and goofy, with 20-year-old special effects. I paid very little for this, but even still, wished it was a renter. ....
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a down is a great great band. The song Chop Suey has been spreading like fire all over the radio and Mtv, it has given the band new hope and will bring lots of more fans to the band. I highly recommend picking up this cd if you are into hard rock. But, if you listen to music at all, i recommend buying every tool cd known to man, because every tool song ever is incredible. SOAD is a great band, but nothing compared to my friends of Tool.
B000002WYT|5.0|I, myself, am a pretty big fan of Dave Matthews. I like the studio stuff and love the live stuff. Crash is actually the only Dave studio album that I own, besides a burned and then lost copy of Under the Table and Dreaming. I own all of the live albums and have downloaded countless songs and concerts from the internet and burned them. And as far as Crash goes, I've always liked the album. But it wasn't until I took a close listen to the album last night that I realized how good it was. I am finding that the album puts the some of the live versions of the songs to shame. &quot;41&quot; for example blows my mind. From the writing to the instrumental jam to the production that fades it into Say Goodbye. I'm blown away. &quot;Two Step&quot; I've found will never be as good live as it is on the album. I don't care how many Tim Reynolds or Butch Taylor soloes you throw in between, none of them will carry the emotion that is packed into the Crash version (although Red Rocks is close). Crash is a masterpiece. From the production which I give just as much credit to as I give to the band, to the wide range of emotions that is touches upon. It makes you want to dance, and it's something you can listen to when you're down. The album is mind blowing.
B00003CXSP|5.0|The second disc does work on my pc, even though a previous reviewer said otherwise.  It was a very good buy, so I wouldn't pass it up based on the previous review.  Buy it now!
B000002JSP|3.0|In Response to one person's review that he finally got to see what was under the brown paper bag. There were actually seven different album covers made for this one. One from the point of view of each of the people in the scene. Don't forget, the ability to color the inside sleeve when you rubbed it with a damp cloth or fingers. Sort of unique and something one might expect from Zeppelin since they often times had trouble coming to agreement with record execs and album covers. As for the music it was a JPJ record with help from RP with lyrics. You really only hear JP with In the Evening. Although there are a couple of places where JB really shines. It was, all together, not a group effort.
B00005NW02|5.0|This album is even more amazing than the last album. If you liked &quot;System of a Down&quot; at all, pick up &quot;Toxicity&quot;. All the songs here are awesome. They are both heavier and more beautiful than the songs on the last album. And all those anoying voice cracks of Serj are gone in this album. It rocks!
B00005JKHP|3.0|More than twenty years after its release, Star Trek: The Motion Picture still gets a mixed reaction from not only Trek fandom but from film critics as well. The latter find many faults with the film, some of which are justified, yet for the former STTMP has many aspects that are unique in comparison to the other Trek films.<br />Without a doubt, this one is the most cerebral. Whiz-bang special effects were there, but the examination of the human condition was never a greater theme within a Trek movie than this one. Unlike its sequelae, the crew members are NOT one big happy crew -- and that makes the film all the more fascinating.<br />James Kirk has been promoted to admiral and a desk job -- and hates it. Accepting promotion was a mistake but, unlike in Star Trek II which deals with a later promotion as an afterthought, here it's front and center. Kirk is so desperate to get his ship back that he's willing to play politics, pull strings and basically derail Captain Matt Decker's career. This is the classic Kirk of the original series, a flawed character fully capable of making mistakes that can cost the lives of his crew. Consult the writers' guide for the original series, and you'll find that it says just that about Kirk.<br />Spock's story line was grafted on to the script as Leonard Nimoy came to the project late, yet it's one whopper of a subplot that resonates throughout the sequels. Obsessed with purging all human emotion, he seeks out the probe approaching Earth so he can mind-meld with it. Spock actually borders on subverting the mission so he can meld with V'ger. Spock realizes after his meld the cosmic joke of his obsession -- logic is damn cold and only organic creatures are capable of feeling. Rather than shun emotions, he should now embrace them. Throughout the sequels, Nimoy plays Spock as a character who now revels in his unique mixture of Human and Vulcan -- as he says in the final film with the original cast, \\"Logic is the beginning of understanding.\\"<br />Star Trek: The Next Generation fans will want to examine the relationship between Decker and navigator Ilia, which was the prototype for the Will Riker/Deanna Troi relationship.<BR>Much has been written about the making of this film, and how often it teetered on disaster. Roddenberry constantly warred with the studio and fellow scriptwriter Harold Livingston. For all the behind-the-scenes drama, STTMP remains a unique entry in the film series, one that will stimulate a lot more intelligent debate than any other Trek movie.
B00005A46T|4.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I'm probably not the &quot;average&quot; Slipknot fan. I'm a 34 year old conservative Republican who just is into heavy metal. That being said, &quot;Iowa&quot; in my opinion does not live up to all of the hype. The self-titled &quot;Slipknot&quot; cd has more energy, has a more raw sound and overall has better songs on it. This cd does have its good points, mostly the production. Knot's sound is much more clear and &quot;produced&quot; this time around and there are several good songs, my favorites being &quot;People=Sh**&quot;, &quot;Disasterpiece&quot; and &quot;I Am Hated&quot;. I still need to listen to it a few more times, but the songs all followed a similar pattern, at least on &quot;Slipknot&quot; there was some variation to the songs. With all of the hype and expectations surrounding this release Slipknot did a good job, but this cd does not exceed the first. If I could I would have given it 3 3/4 stars, but 4 will do.
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a Down, coming from a superior debut releases this sophomore release and it does not disappoint. They remain around their roots and yet are able to produce new sounds never befor heard. This album is filled w/ anthems that make you question your youth. And I LOVE IT. Your parents will hate it, and that's the way Rock and Roll should always seen. The cd-rom is an interesting feature and it makes owning this version special. You should purchase it w/out a second thought, especially if you loved the first.
0553260111|5.0|As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I've been enjoying Robert Ludlum's thrillers for (gasp!) decades.  THE BOURNE IDENTITY is one of Mr. Ludlum's best.  The plot begins when a man, shot and left for dead, is rescued from the sea.  He has no memory, yet he attempts to discover his past.  He learns he is a trained killer and killers are now hunting for him.  They'd like to see him dead.  The plot spins on from there, and the plot is one of Mr. Ludlum's best.  There's some romance.  There's some danger.  There's some action.  There's some adventure.  THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a terrific novel.  I recommend it highly.
0812550706|5.0|This book rocks!  Ender is a small boy who is picked on by a bigger brother and some students in his school. He is quite the genious and it is obvious that he has great potential. He is being observed by the military to see if he is a good candidate to become an army commander and fight a war against an alien race of bugs. The training he goes through is intense and exciting to read.  It involves a bunch of games that teach him military strategy as he must earn the respect of others in his school and proove that he is a great leader.  There is a lot of cleverness in the way these games are played.  This must be one of the greatest science fiction books ever written.
B00005NW02|5.0|the wait was definately worth it.  This cd is spectacular.  I'm listening to it now as I write this.  Their first cd was phenomenal, and now in many ways I see this cd as better.  The vocal harmonies are awesome, the rifts incredible.  Its not overdone and gives off a strong message.  Mixing in their own styles and that of their heritage has created a truly wonderful listening experience.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Having ripped the plastic off the the cover of the DVD and shoved it into the player to experience the reversed chronology and intense performances just hours ago when the DVD arrived in the mail, I can assure you that this is a film not to be missed.  Not only is it a film that's not to be missed, but it is also a crucial addition to any film-goers collection.  <BR>Memento evokes in the viewer a wide variety of conflicting  emotions, from sympathy to rage to confusion to horror.  Christopher Nolan creates a tense and riveting atmosphere where the simple search for a writing utensil becomes a mans chance to find his own identity.<BR>The story centers around Leonard, a man with a memory disorder that cannot remember what he has done since the brutal murder of his wife.  The story is told backward, so that the audience can attempt to grasp, if only for two hours, the emotional agony associated with not knowing what has come before. <BR>It is a film that resonates with the viewer long after the last reel has played.  I do urge you, though, to not waste your time and energy trying to decipher how he remembers some things (like for example that he has a memory disorder), and focus instead on the weary existence and emotional trauma of a man who knows nothing of who he is or was.
B00005NW02|5.0|Just as Id predicted, SOAD pulled no punches and released one of the years best records, while still maturing and growing upon their debut album. This was not an easy task-their s/t album was easily one of the greatest rock releases of 1998. Toxicity takes everything that made that cd good and improves upon it-their unique blend of metal with Armenian influence has become tighter and even more focused. The songs sound even heavier and aggressive than some on the prior album, albeit with more melody. Unexpected time changes still come around with this band, leaving you guessing where it will go next. Songs are still politically charged, and the lyrics are at times bordering on the plain bizarre. The guitar work from Daron is great: melodic while still maintaining a heavy, aggressive edge. The rythymic section backs well, Shavo's basslines flowing perfectly and John beating his kit with an intent fury. The real force on this is Serj however: his vocal work is amazing, and he shines on mellow tracks such as Aerials and ATWA for instance, while still retaining his hardcore vocal style elsewhere. Easily one of the best albums of 2001 (along with Slipknot's Iowa and Slayer's God Hates Us All).
B00004Z459|1.0|Once upon a time, there was a band called Hybrid Theory.  They were working on an album that was to be called \\"Linkin Park\\".  One day, the band decided to flip-flop their album name and their band name, so they were now called Linkin Park, with the album \\"Hybrid Theory\\".  Rumor has it that they changed their name so \\"Linkin Park\\" would be close to \\"Limp Bizkit\\" alphabetically in CD bins around the world.  If this is really true, then it's just one more indication how ENGINEERED this band is.<br />Twelve tracks long, the 38-minute album isn't even as long as some EPs and singles I have.  Toss in the fact that no song hits the 4-minute mark, and not one song has a shred of profanity in it, these guys were MADE for air-play.  Tight guitar riffs, TWO vocalists, and the ever-present DJ are sure to sell to all markets.  Did I mention that all the songs sound the same?  <br />I was driving to work the other day, and the hard rock, alternative, light rock, dance/electronic and college stations ALL played a Linkin Park song on the drive to work.  Give me a break, their songs are around more often than Tool's \\"Schism\\" is now.<br />Sadly, I bought into the hype at first, and picked this up, but after two or three spins, I sold it on Amazon.  At least it wasn't a complete loss, I got a review out of it.
B00005NW02|5.0|this is by far one of the most interesting albums i have ever heard. it goes from thrash to mellow dramatic.from one extreme to the next.even if you are not one of the thousands of system of a down fans it is definately worth listening to if you like music that suddenly changes from one beat to the next it goes from thrash to chris cornell like lyrics and is rated very high on my list
B00005A46T|4.0|Slipknot is more hardcore than ever. In my opinion the<BR>first album is better,but not by far. My favorite song on their<BR>debut album is spit it out. The second album is not quite as violent as the debut. Don't get me wrong Iowa has great songs such as&quot;Disasterpiece&quot; and even my favorite &quot;People=Sh@*&quot;<br /> If you like slipknot as much as I do than I guarentee you'll love this hardcore album Iowa<br />   Slipknot Rules
B000002TQV|5.0|I was a skeptic of Radiohead's staying power in the early days. I didn't particularly like Creep, and heard only lukewarm assessments of the rest of Pablo honey. Then the Bends came out and I walked right past it in the record store without giving it a second thought. But as the last 6 years and 3 more albums have screamed in my face, I was STUPID to dismiss Radiohead so quickly. Luckily, I read several glowing reviews and got the heads-up from my brother that this was just a phenomenal CD. So I bought it a couple months after it came out. Six years later, my first copy of it was lost at the high school radio station, and my second copy of it was played so much that I had to replace it three years ago. such is the staying power of Radiohead.<br />Radiohead have moved on to different sonic and lyrical horizons since the Bends, but the Bends has just as much musical depth and vision as anything they've put out since. People call it their &quot;straight-foward rock album&quot;, and to some extent, that's fair, but not entirely. The Bends just HAPPENS to use GUITARS to express Radiohead's musical vision, rather than using elemtents of electronica, as OK computer started to do, and Kid A relied heavily on. But the depth of sound and other-worldly aura that everyone recognizes in OK, Kid A, and Amnesiac, is present in the Bends too. They twist around their guitars and use loud-soft dynamics to full effect, starting with the opening moments of the album, Planet Telex. They use reverb and a lot of tinkering with distortion and things to create that pulsating guitar beat, and these elements are present in other parts of the album too, such as parts of the Bends, My Iron Lung, and a little bit on black star. The typical sentiment is that Radiohead didn't start experimenting until after the bends, but the sprouts of their vision are quite present here as well. They just happen to be using guitars and, certainly, somewhat more straightforward song structures.<br />Wow, that wasa mouthful. Long story short. Alternative rock lovers (which I was back in 1995) should just adore this album. Recent Radiohead converts who enjoy the electronica aspects or who enjoy somewhat challenging sounds (which I have become lately) should...ALSO adore this album. The songs are too strong, and despite the fact that there is no electronica to speak of, Radiohead still manage to create a unique and powerful sound that is different but somehow akin to their recent outings. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that this album is the ONE Radiohead album that SHOULD appeal to the widest audience. the rock and roll is there, but so is the progressive feel that makes Radiohead unique. 6 years later, it's almost time for my 4th copy of the bends. I still can't get enough.
B0000027RL|5.0|This band is one of the best of their time! Since I started to hear them I also begun to see the world with a different view!They have very good words and of course, music, the vocals are amazing!
1573225517|3.0|Firstly I should state that I am English and I like Hornby as a writer, his Fever Pitch is the  perfect testament to the British football fan (okay Soccer to you lot in the States). So I was quite looking forward to this, many of my friends rate it as one of their favourite books, and it does seem to appeal to both sexes.  Having said that I was a little disappointed and I suspect that it is because of me rather then the book.  I never lived my life through music when I was young and did not associate many events/people with music and songs.  I never wrote endless lists either.<br />If that sounds like you, then this will be the book for you, if not then perhaps it is not.  Likewise it is an insight to a certain type of male, but not all males!<br />This is no bad book but I think it works if you see yourself in it.  I didn't!<br />Much as I hate to say this, the film was probably better.
0060931671|5.0|My brother sent this to me for Christmas... forgetting that he is the literary genius... and I read horror stories and classics.  I loved this book.  I was so utterly confused that my brain couldn't seem to stop analyzing the situations.  The symbolism and paranoia in this book are amazing... And, don't fool yourself into thinking that you will sit back and enjoy the ride.  You will find yourself squinting at anyone in uniform...wondering, if the author knows something that we don't.  Well, what fun is life if you don't really wonder about conspiracy therories?
B00005NW02|4.0|Well... after hearing the first effort from SOAD I was really pumped up for their follow up. After their utterly brilliant debut, the LA quartet had a serious task on their hands to follow it up. After rushing out to buy it on the first day it was available, I have to say that it has lived up to all my expectations... and then some.<br />Toxicity is a natural progression for the band, if natural is the right word to describe such a unique and quirky sound that is System of a Down. The rapid time changes are there once again, heard most evidently on tracks like Chop Suey! and Science. The utterly brilliant Bounce is a testament to how creative these guys really are.<br />The political messages are much more obvious this time around, and despite the occasionally cryptic lyrics (Jet Pilot), they are clearly hammered out in tracks like Prison Song and Psycho. The middle Eastern influence has been toned down slightly from the first album, but the songs here fit better together as a unit then they do on the bands first effort, and are more accesible ('Soil' anyone?), while still retaining their creativity and craziness.  <br />Musically, this album is utterly fantastic. No two songs are the same, and while some may argue that tracks like ATWA are slightly similar to the ones on the first album, what is wrong with that? They still have no parallel on commercial radio. These guys have more creativity in their little finger than Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park and Creed combined.<br />This album is right up there with Fantomas' superb 'The Directors Cut' and rates as one of the best metal releases this year.<br />If you liked the self-titled, you will love this album. If you haven't heard it, do yourself a favour and get a copy of it now!
0316548189|5.0|Nelson Manela has portrayed what is true &quot;freedom&quot; in this book. I cant imagine a person who's closed up for more than a quarter a century, gets out still has such passion and zeal to do so much. His humanity is overwhelming. The world has so much to learn from this living legend. I am amazed at how Mandela prompted the Truth and Reconciliation comission and created a national healing process. <BR>I wish the 'developed' nations can learn from him.
B000002BE9|5.0|Wow. This CD will blow you away. The best tracks: &quot;Sleep to Dream&quot; (the ultimate breakup song!) &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; &quot;Criminal&quot; &quot;Carrion&quot; and the oh-so-slightly naughty &quot;Slow Like Honey&quot;. &quot; &quot;The Child Is Gone&quot; didn't quite live up to the rest of the album, but all in all, a wonderful selection.
0385484518|5.0|In a culture where death is handled in a very 'sanitary' and off-hands way, Morrie talks candidly what it means to die, and how one creates value thru this process!!! We are living in the times of chain-store-funeral-homes! Death is dealt with sorrow and something unnatural. <br />&quot;If you need to learn more about life, learn about death&quot; - This sentiment is embodied in this book. <br />The cherry on the cone is the format of Mentor-desciple relationship between Morrie and his student (from past); its beautiful to see how both are enriched through this experience.<br />A must read for anyone who want to learn how to live!
B00000ICD9|4.0|One of Hollywood's first attempts to address what might be termed the new age view of the afterlife (whether you agree with it or not), with a few simplifications and crossovers to traditional Christian ideals.  In having attempted this, the movie earns points for being somewhat groundbreaking.  <br />Robin Williams is his predictable boundless self, and drives the movie well.  Annabella Sciorra is strained in the role as his wife.  Moreover, the two lack any intensity in chemistry - as a result, the 'love for eternity' theme of the movie seems more concept than reality.  <br />Special effects are awesome, a good attempt at an inherently difficult topic to catalogue.
0156528207|5.0|I read this book to my 4 year old. As I read it on most nights I learn so much about adult behaviour than I had bargained for. Sometimes I embarass myself about adult behaviour.<br />This classic is a must read. I have never read a book for grownups which have pictures next to text. Why don't adults write like Antoine De Saint-Exupery?
0198711905|3.0|The modernised one-volume Oxford Complete Works edited by Wells and Taylor has little of significance to offer that is not bettered by its competitors. Its general introduction is thin and bland, and the introductions to individual plays amount to little more than one-page notes. There are no explanatory notes of any kind to accompany the words on the page, and the glossary at the end of the book offers very little help indeed. Thus readers are largely left to flounder on their own. There are certainly, as much publicity has assured us, a number of new textual features, but these are often characterised by a craving for novelty rather than that they have proved convincing or useful to many readers: fewer and fewer readers today really want two texts of *King Lear*, and the number of people inclined to believe the editorial arguments in favour of the so-called &quot;two-text theory&quot; is decreasing rather than growing; similarly, there are no truly good reasons for calling Falstaff &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot;, etc. As the scholars who have put the edition together are very reputable and their handling of the text does deserve the attention of academics, scholars like myself do, of course, want to own a copy. But I use it sporadically, and hardly feel like recommending it to the non-specialist, who will be much better served by buying, especially, David Bevington's edition, or else - though very much as a second choice - the Riverside, or, failing that - and very much as  a third choice - the Norton. - Joost Daalder, Professor of English, Flinders University (South Australia)
1565114965|3.0|I quickly got hooked on the story of The Girl With The Pearl Earring; however,it didn't take long to find the voice of the reader annoying -- particularly when Jenna Lamia was trying to mimic the voices of characters other than the heroine. Also, perhaps due to the abridged version, I found one incident in the novel to be unbelievable (when the young maid runs to the arms of Peter after her long, brown tresses were seen by Vermeer). Could it be that was the intention of the author -- to create such an incredulous scene after so much ho-hum, hum-drum?

0060920386|5.0|\\"Barbarians at the Gate\\" is a very easy, fun read.  It is purposefully written alot like a novel.  For one thing, the book shifts frequently between different times and places.  For instance, the prologue details the board meeting where CEO Ross Johnson proposes a Leveraged Buy Out (LBO) for the first time.  The start of chapter 7, page 184, then picks up from there chronologically, \\"Johnson rose early the next morning, the memory of Wednesday night's board meeting still fresh in his mind\\" (pg 184).  Also like a novel, the authors give a tremendous amount of background and personal history on the people and companies involved in the deal.  There is history about Ross Johnson's personal history, about his time at Standard Brands and Nabisco before the merger with RJR, and then about RJR the company, dating back to the 1800s.  There is also a chapter that goes into some detail about KKR and Henry Kravis.  All of the information was interesting and well written, though I felt at times like I just wanted to get back to the main plot and away from some of these tangenital details.  It was a choice the authors made between making the book more journalistic and conise or more like a novel, and I guess I ended up liking their choice.<BR>     The heart of the book is the bidding battle for RJR between KKR and the Shearson Lehman Group (which had Johnson on their side); First Boston also makes a bid but I don't think their bid was ever seriously, seriously considered.  The authors describe an LBO as follows, \\"A firm such as Kohlberg Kravis, working with a company's management, buys the company using money raised from BANKS and the PUBLIC SALE OF SECURITIES; the DEBT IS PAID DOWN WITH CASH FROM THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS and, often, by SELLING PIECES OF THE BUSINESS\\" (pg 101).  So that is how KKR and the LBOs work.  The book takes you through the day by day strategy sessions of the different groups, their attempts to raise financing (equity from private investors, junk bonds issued by the investment banks, and commercial bank loans), their responses to moves from the other side, the meetings of the Special Comittee which would decide which bid to accept, etc....  There are alot of late nights, alot of re-crunching the numbers, alot of personality clashes, lawyers, investment bankers, and more.  The writing was so good that it made me feel like I was there, following the deal step by step, and gaining an understanding of what the various parties do and what goes on in an LBO.  It was like reading a story and learning about LBOs and how big deals get made at the same time.  Very rewarding.  I usually don't like books to be this long (515 pgs) but in this case I think almost every pages was worth it.<BR>                          Greg Feirman
B00005A46T|3.0|I almost wrote a glowing review of this CD the day after I bought it, but unfortunately it is getting worse instead of better with each listen. The trademark sound and fury is there, but I was hoping for a bit more. The biggest problem is that the lyrics range from uninspired to downright stupid (&quot;If you're 555 then I'm 666&quot;. Give me a break...) Every song is simply more of the same &quot;I hate you more than I did last time&quot; jibberish and it gets real old real fast.<br />Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of the whole Nu-metal sound, but Slipknot's debut is still one of my all-time favorite disks. I have the feeling &quot;Iowa&quot; will be collecting dust on my shelf before too long, especially with brilliant albums like System of a Down's &quot;Toxicity&quot; out. Give them credit for one thing: this is an uncompromising CD and they didn't water their sound down like so many other bands do after a kick-a$$ first album. Kudos for that, but a little more creativity next time would be nice.
0060194995|5.0|I recently watched the movie &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; with Gregory Peck and realized that I had never read the book. I was really anticipating reading the movie. Yet, I gained a lot more. The story written by Harper Lee is MASTERFUL. Her word use keep me in the dictionary but I was amazed at how much I wanted more. The adventures of Jem and Scout were priceless and they always taught a lesson. For instance, Jem and Scout thought their father, Atticus, was boring and unlike other fathers until with a single shot he killed a &quot;mad dog&quot;. Lee's vivid and clear description of the events made you simply want more. The story that began with simple childhood couriosity quickly changed to the evils of racial discrimination and prejudices. Jem and Scout learned a lot about themselves, their father, racism, and most of all - Always treat people the way you want to be treated!<br />Peace and Blessings!
B000001ELF|4.0|Putting aside some reviewers below thaa no doubt are KISS maniacs and will rate everything they do five-stars, I must state that this ACE FREHLEY solo album is the best hard rock music you can get. Nothing less, nothing more. Except from the cover of NEW YORK GROOVE ( which repeats the chorus infinite times, then over and over again !!!!), all the tracks are killers. Ace play most of the instruments, with crack session musician Anton Fig handling the drums.
B00005KHJR|5.0|First, let me say I feel this is the most underated movie of all time! This movie has a history so bizaar you wonder how it's survived! The movie has been butchered over and over and there's so much controversey over who has the COMPLETE version of the film! Well, probably someone does and until they give up the rights, we'll probably never see the entire movie fully restored! But saying that, I still feel this movie is worth buying(especially if you've never seen it at all) just so you can have it in your collection! These reviewers telling you not to buy the movie are only hurting the movie from being seen at all! Even if you could buy the complete version somewhere, it would probably cost you an arm and a leg to get it! So to all of you who haven't seen this picture, buy it! The theatrical version is 88 min. and the extended version is 100 min. The 88 min. version has been remastered and 5.1 sound while the extended version isn't. It's just mono with a VHS quality to the video. If you're interested in the history of this film, the 35 minute documentary on the film is included and it explains the fall of British Lion films and how the film was distributed to america all butchered up! Christopher Lee gives one of his finest performances and Edward Woodward does a fine job as the american sent to investigate the missing young girl. One thing I found humorous in the radio spots for the film is when they mention that &quot;it's the film ROD STEWART doesn't want you to see!&quot;<br />Britt Ekland is in the movie and she was dating Rod Stewart at the time! All in all, this movie is worth buying and it's for people want something different from what hollywood currently makes today! Also, anyone who puts down ANCHOR BAY entertainment should keep quiet! They do the best job at remastering their movies and that's the bottom line! Also, I didn't see any other major studio trying to get the rights to THE WICKER MAN and if they had, you wouldn't get half of what you get withthis Limited edition!
B000001EIA|3.0|As an old fan I was sad to see KISS venturing into another totally commercial project along with the dreadful MTV. On the other side, I was surprised by the good playing in this live performance (I hope there are few overdubs made in studio in this album.... maybe Im being naive....).
0684800713|5.0|\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was first published in 1926, and it was the novel that launched the career of young Hemingway. An amazing career that should include winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, and earn the praise as one of the greatest American writers ever.<br />\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was my third novel by Hemingway, (the two other being \\"For whom the Bell tolls\\" and \\"The old man and the sea\\"). After reading some of the reviews here, I find that either you love this novel (and Hemingway) or you don't. But even if you don't particularly care for Hemingway, I think there are things in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" that you could enjoy, be it bull fights or Paris in the 20'ies.<br />I have to confess that I only started reading Hemingway last year, yet he's become one of my very favorite authors. I love his spare, almost brutally economic writing style. Hemingway uses such a simple language, yet one feels it as the richest ever.<br />The setting of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is in Paris in the 1920'ies. A bunch of rich kids, American and British expatriates, (\\"the lost generation\\") who fought in WWI, are now doing little but strolling around the streets of Paris, looking for a nice restaurant to eat and drink, or attending the \\"occasional\\" party. If they are not clubbing/partying, they are traveling around. What a nice life!<br />Hemingway lived for many years in Paris and also spent much time in Pamplona, Spain, which of course has contributed to the spot-on accurate, realistic account both geographically, and also from the life of expatriates and social events happening.<br />This is a classic masterpiece, ready to be re-read anytime!
B00005NW02|5.0|There is alot of crap on the tv and on the radio these days. So many cheap bands who call themselves &quot;metal&quot; But System release another awesome album that is even more quirky and original than  their first effort. System is one of a few good new heavy metal bands who do everything from punk to thrash to jazz to middle eastern styles. This is an album  for fans of good taste. SOAD HAVE SAVED US!
B000007WNN|5.0|I own all the cult albums and none can hold a candle to ELECTRIC.It resides in the elite class of albums including NEVERMIND, BACK IN BLACK, MOVING PICTURES, and POWERTRIP.  If you want to buy another cult album your best bet is the boxed set.  It is well worth the money.
B00000JQFM|1.0|Are you kidding? I felt like putting on my acid-wash jeans and sitting by the fire with my girlfriend in her flashdance sweatshirt and stirrup pants. This is not music to appreciate - this is music to accompany some cheasy 80's movie or Aaron Spelling series.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Memento is a film I had a little trouble following at times and I have to see it again to truly understand it. Still though, it's a really an original piece of work. It's not every film where you hear the lead charcater say &quot;I'm chasing someone,....oh wait, he's chasing me&quot;, I love scenes like that. Guy Pearce does a great job in the film too, it's an very unusual role and he handles it very well. Joe Pantalino and Carrie Anne Moss a very good too as the 2 people he trusts his memories with. Memento is brain twisting and a bit confusing but still, I loved it!
B00005A1PR|5.0|Arie gives props to Wonder and rightfully so. The influence shows thru.. in the best way. While everyone's praising Brown Skin and Video, which are excellent, there are other true gems: Back to the middle, Promises, Beautiful. Songs such as these (i.e. subject matter and sincerity) have not been heard (frequently) from black artists for more than 25 years. Finally, someone who sings from the heart about issues other than sex, ego, and ghetto. Excellent overall, except for a few non-descript pieces, which are easily outweighed by the great.
B00000AFGM|5.0|I think this is certainly Manson's best CD.  While others lament the fact that it's very different from &quot;Antichrist Superstar,&quot; I think that's a good thing.  Now, don't get me wrong:  I thought &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; was a good album, but it seemed like Trent Reznor re-packaged.  On &quot;Mechanical Animals,&quot; Manson proves to be a man of diversity, going from grinding tracks to &quot;Omega and the Mechanical Animals.&quot;  If you ever wanted to get a Manson CD, this is definitely one to consider.  In my opinion, it's simply one of the greatest CDs of the '90's.
B00003XACV|5.0|Excellent, interesting pieces that transport you emotionally and intellectually. Many pieces are aptly named (for better or worse). Listen to &quot;Bloodless Freak&quot; and &quot;Choking the Bishop&quot; -- you'll understand. It's hard to beat &quot;Dead Already&quot; and the more powerful version &quot;Still Dead&quot;--Very emotion filled, percussive bookends on this awesome musical volume.
B00004XQ83|4.0|Best CD I've purchased in a long time. I listen to it over and over and don't think I'll ever tire of it. Even if you don't listen to hillbilly music generally, you will love this as a refreshing new change to your usual tunes. Don't miss it!
0684859106|4.0|Thoguh others might not feel this way, this book is easy to understand and to follow through. I felt taht the end result was just and they are in the actual bakery. I feel this is a good book for anyone starting out in baking or a more advanced baker.
B00003CXDG|1.0|As a Tom Cruise fan I anticipated a much better movie. The story line is weak, the premises are weak, the characters are weak, there is nothing redeeming about MI2. For example, the bad guys supposedly have captured Cruise and shoot him. But it turns out that Cruise in 60 seconds has put his face (mask) on the bad guy and the bad guys face(mask) on himself, so they shoot the bad guy not Cruise. Apparently Cruise must carry a set of masks of all the bad guys plus his own in his pocket??? A weak movie-a waste of money.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Probably the best movie of this year, there is no doubt in my mind that it's at least worthy of contention in that category. Memento is a briskly paced movie that's told in the reverse direction, from end to beginning. While some feel that this device is &quot;gimmicky&quot; and doesn't add any value to the actual story, I feel that it adds to the movie's central message, it's central theme - what's the impetus for anything, everything that we do?<br />The dvd is missing commentaries that we'd expect from a picture of this scope, but it makes up for it by including the original short story that the movie is based on. It also has the standard trailers. What I was hoping they would've included was an option to play the movie in the forward direction, from beginning to end. <br />I've given this movie a five because it exceeded every expectation of mine. You go to a movie to be entertained. This movie made me think...a rare treat in today's market. Guy Pearce is excellent, and Carrie Anne Moss is so cunningly evil in this picture. <br />While I highly recommend this picture to anyone, I'd hesitate in recommending it to those who watch pictures passively, those who look for a story - a plot, to sustain their attention. Memento is much more than that. At times, it might be overwhelming to the typical movie goer. In any case, it's definitely worth watching at least once. Trust me, you'll remember it after that. Just one question: How did Leonard know that he has a condition with his memory, if he can't remember a damn thing?
6305508550|5.0|Let me guess: you have a lot of friends who are always talking about it.  I know.  I did... which annoyed me to the point where I finally rented it.  I was not disappointed.  That's why I bought it on DVD.<br />This is one of those classic, cult &quot;quote&quot; movies that you'll be quoting for the rest of your life, because it's so dead-on.  If you've EVER worked 9-to-5, EVERYTHING here is going to ring true and the over-the-top performances--most notably Gary Cole's--are even more hilarious because, well, they're not that over-the-top!<br />This ranks up there with movies like Swingers: dead-on pieces that are so sharply accurate and so full of great lines that... well, you might as well see it and get it over with or suffer the fate of hearing your friends quote it every time you're out on the town!<br />It poops out a bit at the end, but the one-liners are worth it alone.  The rap soundtrack--seemingly totally incongruous--works effectively well.  I bought that too.<br />The ultimate parody revenge for working stiffs on their corporate bosses.  Classic.  Smart.
B00004YZFR|5.0|This film set out to capture &quot;The Woodstock of the West Coast&quot; and ended up documenting, in frightening detail, the end of the sixties. Watch as drugged-out, disillusioned hippies grow restless and violent during an out-door concert on the Altamont Speedway outside San Francisco. This is one of the best sociological documents of all time, depicting the descent of a mob into chaos and disorder. A horrifying and macabre view of the end of an era. Essential to any collection.
B000002UEB|5.0|Queensryche may have looked like a bunch of Poodle rock boys (remember this album their fourth was released in 1988) but nothing could be further from reality. Long dubbed, the thinking mans heavy metal band, they somehow manage to fall between a lot of Kennels, and therefore very difficult to classify, does somewhere between Metallica and Rush help? No I didn't think so.<br /> Operation: Mindcrime is arguably Queensryches best release, which garnered the band much needed critical and public success (although mainly in their native America).<br /> The experiment of releasing a concept album worked very well, a complicated story line, which sometimes needs to be held together by the shorter songs, nonetheless it was a step in the right direction after some of the more outrageous story lines in previous concept albums by other artists. Here a disillusioned entrepreneur gets fed up with the Reegan era U.S. Government and joins an underworld terrorist organization determined to rid itself of all political scumbags, during his time with them he develops a relationship with a woman and gets involved in the terrorist drug culture, and is then told by the movement, that his alinement with the women is threatening the structure of the underground unit, so he has to kill her, he does so, following orders blindly, and then realizes what he has become, where upon his world falls apart completely.<br /> The music on the album would stand up on its own, without any story, the twin lead guitar work is superb, whilst Geoff Tate's vocals reveal his earlier operatic training. The songs range from the out &amp; out thrash of \\"Revolution Calling\\" &amp; the \\"Needle Lies\\", to the biting &amp; highly cynical \\"I Don't Believe In Love\\", the albums central &amp; most powerful song in performance, musicianship, sense of style, and drama is also the album's longest song clocking in at over 10 minutes \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" opening with the spoken words \\"Kill her, that's all you have to do\\" \\"Kill Mary\\" \\"She's a risk, and get the priest as well\\". You know you in few a rough ride from that moment. Geoff Tate is joined on vocals by Pamela Moore who plays the unfortunate Sister Mary. In its self \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" is one of the most exceptional one song stories ever written (alongside Mott the Hoople's satire on the music business \\"Marionette\\").<br /> Unfortunately Queensryche always struggled after this to match their masterpiece, and never reached the heights of superstardom that you would of imagined at this point, and were eventually overtaken in the prog metal championship by counter parts \\"Dream Theatre\\", but therby hangs another tail.<br /> This album still stands up today as a classic of its genre.<br />Mott the Dog.\\"She's a risk, and get the priest as well\\".

B000002GB2|4.0|This was Styx's transitional album from the regional Wooden Nickel days to the mega-stardom days of the Grand Illusion and Paradise Theater albums.  Styx was able to blend bubblegum pop with light progressive suites better than most acts of the 70's and this album showcases just how they did that.<br />The album starts off on the lighter side with the appropriately titled Light Up and continues with the light fair with Lorelie.  Both songs harken back to the Wooden Nickel days, tight, fast compositions.  It segues to Mother Dear, which is Curelewski's Coda to the band - as he was replaced by Tommy Shaw on the next album.  Shaw's brand of pop rock cemented Styx's broadbased appeal, but Curelewski's progressive roots for the band would be sorely missed.  <br />Lonely Child is a typical DeYoung composition of the era that could have been penned either during the wooden nickel days or the A&M years.  Side two opens with Midnight Ride, which is just as typical of a JY song as Lonely Child was of a DeYoung tune.  I always get it mixed up with Shooz, which appeared on this album's follow-up, Crystal Ball.<br />The album finishes off with a dynamite DeYoung 3-punch, Born for Adventure, Prelude 12, and Suite Madame Blue ride the crest of progressive rock very well.  They are exquisitely produced, powerful and well delivered.  The best of the album, and among the best of the band's impressive catalog.  <br />On the whole, the album is a bit uneven compared to their later works that were always so well produced (in some cases, too well produced).  But there are nuggets to cherish here that are sublime 70's excess.<br />Questions email me...
B00000K32J|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this variation of LOTD.The dancers, musicians, and singer all seemed to be having fun while doing their numbers. My favorite example is the great Gillian Norris performing &quot; Gypsy &quot; You could see her beautiful face and smile. She seemed to be having a great time while being erotic as she danced.Also her &quot; Fiery Nights &quot; number was excellent ( including the outfit).Bernadette Flynn's dance numbers were also superb. Again the dances were the same as LOTD, however again there seemed to be more sexual energy and passion in her dances. Anne Buckley's songs were sung like a angel from Heaven.                 The 2 fiddler players were superb as they were in LOTD'Michael Flatley did not do as many dance numbers as before but was his usual flamboyant self.I recommend this show to anyone who likes to watch, fantastic Irish step dancing, beautiful Irish women, Celtic music, good choreography, Great sets and lighting.
B000005HN6|5.0|It's very hard to describe exactly what Opeth have done. First off, Mikael ...kerfeldt is nothing short of a genius. I don't like to call it &quot;Death Metal&quot; because when people hear that, they always put it in the same box with all that Cannibal Corpse/Deicide/&amp;c crap. I generally tell people that it's &quot;Symphonic Metal&quot;, but people always get the image of a metal band playing with an orchestra. Mikael's growling is not like normal growling. Typically, death vocalists distort their tongues into a &quot;V&quot; shape. Almost inevitably, this irreversibly damages their throats. Since Mikael naturally sounds like that, not only does he not have to worry about throat damage, but as an added bonus, it doesn't sound like he's growling, but, rather, like he's singing in a new register; a new key; a new tone; one that nobody has ever discovered before. I've gotten quite a few people hating me for saying this, but Mikael ...kerfeldt is a much, much better death vocalist than Dan Swanö. Given, if you put &quot;Orchid&quot; and &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; side-by-side, &quot;Orchid&quot; seems somewhat juvenile. However, consider the fact that &quot;Orchid&quot; is a debut album, and one will find it no less than explosive. This truly is a great album and deserves at least one try by every single person on the planet.

B0000019PA|5.0|So much has been written about this record, here and elsewhere, I won't try to add anything new.  I am compelled to write this review only because I believe this to be the most brilliantly conceived, emotionally evocative, mind-numbingly wonderful piece of art I have seen emerge in my lifetime.  I have given this album to a widely disparate group of my friends, and each has said it is one of their favorite albums of all time.  There is nothing more anyone can tell you.  Buy the album.  Memorize it.  Go on-line and find the stories of Jeff Mangum reading &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; and then realize what the lyrics are really about.  Freak out.  Keep listening.  You will never want to stop.

This album, as expected, stunned me just as much.<BR><BR>WFCC had a lot more low-end, and was darker. But that isn't to say Jane Doe is just as heavy. High-pitched screeches from singer Jake Bannon, and incredible skill displayed by the rest of the band at it's very best. Converge has changed, but not radically and certainly for the better! Complex guitar grooves, insane drumming, and even the occaisional background singing.<BR><BR>Even the cd in it's physical form is beautiful - comes in a digi pack with a tinted jewel case, containing a thick booklet of the singer's artwork and the lyrics which are, as always, oustanding (if you can read the text).

B00005OLY5|5.0|If your a big fan of J.R. Tolkiens, (I know I am!) you must get this movie. Of course, it is not based on the books at all, but it is terribly exciting to see that world come alive. The movie will keep you entertained each second, giving the viewers many twists and turns to keep them laughing, or in suspense. Ron Howard definetly gave it his all to make this movie big, and boy, is it more than just big. Val Kilmer, (Mad Mardagon) delivers a comic relief to the film, as well do the Brownies. But many fights and close calls lead to a perfect balance of humor and action! If you ever get the chance to get Willow, GET IT! It is rare and valuable, but most importantly, its a dang good movie!
B000000I0H|5.0|A sweet album. Very close to your soul.
B00005LKIM|1.0|Oh what a horrible movie!  I fell asleep twice during the movie, very disappointed that number one, it did not follow the book AT ALL and number two it was just that awful!  <br />No wonder Jodie Foster passed on this movie.  It was a stinker!  There were so many plot holes that it was frustrating to keep up with this movie.<br />The whole idea that Hannibal Lecter was in love with Clarice Starling was something new to me.  The man is a manipulative person who likes to toy with people.  He has no love for anyone.  Julianne Moore did her best but she seemed to be going through the motions in the elaborate DARK *ss movie.<br />What a waste.  I wish I could give this a minus three star rating.
0517122707|5.0|I very rarely give a book a rating of a five. You've got to be PERFECT to get a rating of 5 from me. That being said, I regret that I am only able to give this book 5 stars, and not 6!<br />I snatched up this book at Borders one day, knowing nothing about the background. I didn't have a clue that it was awarded a Pulitzer until I read the cover a little closer. At any rate, this marvelous book pulled me into the story in a way that very few others have been able to. It is keeping &quot;Catch 22&quot; and &quot;THe Sound and the Fury&quot; company on my shelf of books I read at least once a year.<br />Rehashing what I thought of the book could never do it justice. Ignatius is one of the most complex characters I have ever had the privledge of reading. That being said, the book is not at all pretentious and not at all &quot;artsy fartsy&quot; as some Pulitzer Prize novels are. I was expecting more heavy, intense reading that would take me a month or so to complete. This book is a page turner all the way. I would recommend this book to anyone.
6305609721|5.0|Most people fail to realize that there is an unkown trilogy in the Trek series.  (Now at nine movies, and ten is being produced)  In ST2, the theme was Admiral Kirk wanting to get the command of a starship.  Obviously in that movie, Spock dies.  That set up ST3.  Admiral Kirk and his friends steal the USS Enterprise, and thus become criminals and trators to the Federation.  Kirk does this to save spock (which he does), but ends up on Vulcan for a long time.  In ST4, We pick up at Vulcan.  Spock has to learn everything again (logic, and many other stuff), Admiral Kirk polls the crew and decides to go back to Earth and face charges by the Federation, and serve obvious Jail time.  <BR>As he is set to come back, a probe enters Earth's orbit and begins to suck up all the water on the planet.  Evidently, they are searching for a species that they have been speaking with for centuries.  The humpback whale.  Yes, apparetnly the sounds of the whales went through space and met up with some alien out there.  Kirk decides that he must save earth, and goes back in time to retreave a whale.  He goes from 2282 to 1986.  Humor abounds when Kirk has to hide Spock's ears, and claim that he is just on &quot;LDS&quot;.  Very funny stuff.  Anyway, they return to the 23rd Century, and release the whale, and they talk to the probe, and the probe leaves.  Boom, earth saved by Kirk again.  (As he did in ST1)  <BR>He still must face trial though.  At the trial, Kirk is punished, but not as badly(i mean come on, he just saved the earth!)  He gets demoted in rank and becomes Captin of the USS Enterprise-A.  The story ends, Kirk is back in starfleet, is back as a Captin, thus ending the whole story that started in ST2.  This is the best of the little trilogy though, and is a must buy.  Very good film.
B00005NW02|5.0|Toxicity may very well be better than System of a Down's self-titled release. That is a bold statement considering how great the self-titled was.  SoaD have definitely progressed from their hard-hitting debut, while still keeping the core sound that made System of a Down one of the most exciting and intriguing releases in recent memory. In Toxicity, SoaD have made a near-perfect blend of fine-tuned melody and pounding, in-your-face thrash. The best, and most accesible, example of this is the first single, &quot;Chopy Suey!&quot; It starts soft, then immediately picks up into heavy riffs. Suddenly it stops on a dime and makes a seamless transition into the melodic chorus, and then launches off into another heavy verse.<br />The first half of the album is arguably a little weaker than the latter half, but this does not detract from the listening experience. The sheer momentum of the fast, heavy tracks carries the listener through the first five songs with some melodic moments (The bridge in Deer Dance comes to mind) into 'Chop Suey!', where the bands expanded melodicism begins to burrow itself within the tightly-crafted song structures. The song 'Bounce' shrugs it off, but 'Forest' attacks with nice melodies and massive hooks. 'ATWA' is one of the softest songs on the CD, and it's very nice. 'Science' is another great track with a catchy chorus. 'Shimmy' breaks away from sound of the latter half of the CD with cooky lyrics and heavy instruments. The title track is interesting and takes a little getting used to because of how the vocals were arranged. 'Psycho' is heavy and cooky in parts, and melodic and cooky in other parts. Near the end is a wonderful guitar solo, which is surprising. A welcome surprise. 'Aerials' is a phenomenal track with beautiful melodies and huge hooks. After 'Aerials' is over, a few seconds will pass and 'Arto', the hidden track, will come on. It has a very tribal feel a la Sepultura; it's a good way to close the album.<br />My only gripes withthe CD is that many songs are short, and the album length is only 44 minutes. Other than that, it's good. Very good.  If you are a fan of System of a Down, you must get this album. If you didn't like the first album much, and are looking into Toxicity, I highly recommend it to you. Toxicity is a breath of fresh air among all of the putrid crap plaguing us today. If you are looking for something a different and interesting, Toxicity is for you.<br />My favorite tracks:  'Deer Dance', 'Chop Suey!', 'Forest', 'ATWA', 'Toxicity', 'Psycho', and 'Aerials'.<br />The bonus CD-ROM caused problems with my computer, so I have no idea if it is any good.
0375756825|5.0|Them that die'll be the lucky ones.<br />  -Treasure Island<br />The last few pirate movies (Hook and Cutthroat Island among them) have bombed so disastrously at<br />the box office that it's hard to tell whether it was simply because they weren't very good or whether<br />kids have abandoned the genre.  I certainly hope it's the former, I'd hate to think that kids today are<br />missing out on all the great pirate tales that we used to thrill too.  Foremost of these was, of course,<br />Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson.<br />I may well be wrong here, but it seems to me that Stevenson pioneered one of the central techniques of<br />children's literature ; placing a child at the center of what might otherwise be a typical adult adventure<br />novel.  This simple but ingenious idea gives kids a character to identify with and allows the author to<br />write from the child's perspective.<br />In the case of Treasure Island, young Jim Hawkins narrates the story of how he and Squire Trelawney,<br />Dr. Livesey, and the enigmatic Long John Silver ended up on board the Hispaniola, looking for the<br />lost treasure of the notorious pirate Captain John Flint.  Packed with betrayals, battles, mutinies, and<br />even a parrot squawking &quot;Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!&quot;, the book is the source for many of the<br />enduring and beloved clich&eacute;s of the genre.<br />This is a classic that each generation should discover anew.  Heck, if enough kids start reading it again,<br />maybe Hollywood will even take another crack at a pirate movie, this time a decent one.<br />GRADE : A+
B00001ODHL|4.0|Army of Darkness, the third movie in the cult classic, is the crown jewel of the series.  Whereas the previous two were more of the classic horror movie, this one is geared towards a more comic genre.<br />This one picks up where the last one left off and we find Ash stranded in the Middle Ages surrounded by Knights who think he is an enemy.  Our shot-gun packing hero soon takes charge of the situation and what follows is certainly one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen.  Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash.  He obviously relishes the role and plays it to the hilt.<br />Director Sam Raimi would go on to bigger and better things (For Love of the Game and other movies) but this one is my favorite by far.  If you love horror and comedy, this DVD is a must have.  4.5 stars.
B00004I9VE|5.0|I won't spend any word on the album itself. Anybody knows it. The SACD version is quite good, for sure better than the original and remastered recordings. Resoluton is a bit superior and you can have the &quot;analogue&quot; feeling that SACD delivers, in terms of detail and spatial definition. Maybe the increased price is not entirely justified by the quality improvement.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I know in todays society with offspring coming from the &quot;RAPCRAP&quot;<BR>generation, not really generation X unless X=0, have difficulty understanding &quot;Citizen Cane.&quot; The ones that feel the &quot;special effects&quot; were missing from this movie or lacking enough sex or violence should also refrain from commenting with their lack of experience with movies dealing with substance and meaning. That would be like handing your car keys to a 5 year old. But for all those who have watched other fine &quot;meaningful&quot; films can appreciate the ending as well as the rest of the movie. The genius way the flashbacks were used to tell a long history of years in just a few moments. I also recommend &quot;A Raisen in the Sun&quot; and &quot;Guess whose coming to Dinner&quot; both Sidney Poitier movies that deal with social culture historically and are also in the top 5 of all movies I feel are &quot;True American Classics.&quot;
B000000JO3|5.0|Ok, forget the whole straight edge thing for a minute and just looked at Minor Threat for what it is... great punk rock. Actually the best, musically this record sets the bar for where other groups should aim. I think non straight edge kids dont give this a chance because they think it's not for them. This record is for everyone that feels like they don't fit and the world around them is going down the drains. It's raw, unclean, and would make alot of &quot;older folks&quot; shiver, but it sounds great to me. I think it's unpolished sound adds to it's classicalness and makes it timeless. I strongly believe that I will always listen to this record, even when I'm sixty.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Like The Usual Suspects and The Limey before it, the &quot;truth&quot; if you will about Memento is not told during the actual film, but rather the writer has decided to leave it up to the viewer to fill in the blanks. Post modern and how.<br />What Chris Nolan does give us is one heck of great film which will keep you absolutely glued to your chair. I even suggest watching it with someone so you can bounce ideas off of each other during and after the movie. Things slowly begin to unravel during Memento, and the end manages to completely unglue everything you thought had figured out concerning Guy Pierce's very well acted character, Leonard Stanley. My friend and I have come up with three possible scenarios, which range from plot loophole to a deranged scerial killer with charm. I'm going to have to study it further.<br />Oh, the DVD extras are a complete waste of time and contribute nothing to the actual, wonderful movie. I really enjoyed Memento and am very glad that I own it. So i can watch it again and again and etc.
B00003CXTF|3.0|Let this be said at the outset, Touchstone Pictures' &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; will not go down in cinematic history as the greatest film ever made.  There are points of corny dialogue, as an actual history it is a disaster, and at some of its most crucial moments, the story suddenly goes oddly flat.  Yet, in spite of its obvious shortcomings, it works reasonably well as an evocation of how the nation saw itself seeing itself, as well as providing some undeniably spectacular special effects and a love story that is better than the critics have made it out to be.<br />The story is fairly straightforward.  Two boys who grew up together as best friends fascinated by the daring-do of the World War I air aces, join the Army Air Corps on the eve of World War II.  The older man, Rafe (Ben Affleck), is cocky, self-assured, and eager to be a hero.  The younger man, Danny (Josh Hartnett), is sensitive, somewhat shy, and was presumably traumatized by his father's emotional breakdown after fighting in the trenches of France during the Great War. When Rafe joins the Eagle Squadron, a British unit for American volunteer pilots, and is subsequently presumed killed in action, Danny first comforts, and then falls in love with, Rafe's girlfriend, a Navy nurse named Evelyn - played by the lovely Kate Beckinsale.  On the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack, Rafe returns - it transpires that he had been rescued by a French fishing boat and was hiding out in occupied France - causing a love triangle that is interrupted by the Japanese attack.  In the end, Rafe and Danny reconcile just before both participate in the April, 1942 Dollittle raid on Tokyo, with Evelyn waiting back at Pearl to find out if her men will make it home from the mission.<br />The critics have said that the portrayal of the attack is the strongest part of the film and that the love story is dispensable.  Actually, the reverse is true.  For a student of history, the &quot;historical&quot; aspects of the film are either inaccurate, incomplete, or simply false.  Speaking as a Washington, DC area resident, it is unclear why the local audience did not break out in giggles when the Navy Department building that appears on screen is actually the House side of the U.S. Capitol.  (One wag called it the Navy Department's House of Representatives annex.)  The battle scenes, though indisputably gripping, are almost too glitzy, with Japanese and American warplanes performing tactics best suited to Star Wars X-wing fighters, and at least one shot with 1990's vintage aircraft carriers being included in a &quot;fleet at sea&quot; scene.  This is mostly good visual stuff, but for anyone with a little historical knowledge, it is distracting.  (One big exception - the sequence showing the capsizing of USS Oklahoma is very well done.)<br />The love story, on the other hand, has all of the feel of a 1943 vintage romance and war movie.  Somewhat hokey and a little overwought, but nevertheless compelling.  The viewer gets a feel not so much for the times themseleves, but for the cinema at a time when Americans went to the movies both for entertainment and for reaffirmation.  The movie evokes the world as it was in 1941 as viewed through the prism of moviegoers during the war and its immediate aftermath.  It is a mixture of innocence, foreboding, nostalgia and cliche.<br />To be certain, sometimes the story falls flat.  Although Affleck, Beckinsale and Harnett all put in good performances, they do not have enough time - even in a three hour movie - to convey all the information that the viewer needs to be fully engaged with the characters.  (The novel that came out with the movie fills in many gaps.)  Also, the scene where Evelyn sees Rafe alive for the first time is oddly muted.  Evelyn is shocked at first, but moves straight to confusion over her feelings for both Rafe and Danny.  The expected intervening step - joy at seeing Rafe alive - never transpires, making the whole scene seem an anti-climax.<br />Also, the movie never makes explicit that although Evelyn loves Danny, Rafe is her true love.  Instead, she is made to seem that she is not making a choice, thereby draining some of the dramatic oxygen.  Nor does it clearly explain on what basis Rafe and Danny seem to reconcile, instead there is a scene in which both characters seem to go from wary antagonism to renewed affection in a split second. (Again, the book clarifies much.)<br />One other peculiar aspect of the movie is its rather grim tone - surprising in a summer movie.  Although Wallace and Bay work tirelessly to bring out themes of pride and patriotism, they never fully succeed.  It is just too hard to look at wrecked battleships and shattered corpses to feel all that good.  Even the end sequences, which are emotionally the most powerful - and arguably the best dramatice scenes - in the movie, do not create feelings of patriotism so much as a sense of wistfulness.  The audience feels happy for the characters, but it is mixed with a sense of loss.  This will probably be effective with older audiences, but may lack the emotional lift that the under 30 crowd seems to require of its movies.<br />Notwithstanding these weaknesses, the &quot;period&quot; feel of the movie works.  The viewer gets a glimpse of movies circa 1943.  Oddly, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!,&quot;  which is an outstanding and historically more accurate movie, fails to deliver in this category - the characters in that movie could as easily be in 2001 as 1941.  (As to those critics who complain that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is not about Pearl Harbor, you probably name your cats, Kitty, and your dogs, Spot.)<br />As to the performances, almost all the cast perform well, if not always up to their finest earlier work.  Affleck is convincing as the cocky pilot, and his sequences with Beckinsale demonstrate the same kind of restrained, and for that seemingly more authentic, emotion as he showed as the cocky ad agent in &quot;Bounce.&quot;  (Though, overall, he is better in &quot;Bounce.&quot;)  Beckinsale is gorgeous in 1940's vintage attire and hairstyle and brings off even the most cliched lines - and she gets her fair share - with a naturalness that makes them acceptable to 21st century audiences.  Hartnett has the toughest job as the introspective Danny in a cast of very prominent characters, but pulls it off to remarkable effect.<br />As to Cuba Gooding Jr., Dan Akroyd, Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin and the rest of the cast, all do creditable work.  The one exception is the Japanese actor, Mako, whose Admiral Yamamoto is played without the subtlety that Soh Yamamura brought to the role in &quot;Tora!, Tora!, Tora!.&quot;  An occassional physical gesture, such as shaking his head with regret when he delivers the obligatory -for Pearl Harbor movies - &quot;sleeping giant&quot; line, might have made his character seem more real.  Instead, each line is delivered as if Yamamoto was reading a cue card.  (NOTE to the subtitle writer: It's &quot;The rise OR fall of our empire...&quot; not, &quot;The rise AND fall of our empire...&quot;)<br />Taken together, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is not the strongest movie, but its feelings are real and it definitely taps into the anxiety, harshness,beauty, courage, and heroism that Americans equate with the movies of that period.  That probably accounts for &quot;Pearl Harbor's&quot; bad reviews.  The critics, and unfortunately probably most younger audiences, want an action story or a love story, and cannot relate very much to, or empathize with, evocations of a world long since past and that seems, in retrospect, pitiably naive.  That is sad, but less for the talented and underapprecited cast and crew of &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; than for the viewers who will see it.Also, the movie never makes explicit that although Evelyn loves Danny, Rafe is her true love.

6303269842|5.0|The cast of &quot;Maverick&quot; was entirely well-suited for this comedy. A viewer can sense how much everyone enjoyed working together. It was especially fun watching the three leads outfox each other as well as outsiders. The banter between the characters was appropriately fast-paced. Danny Glover had an interesting cameo as a bank robber who fails to recognize the fellow with whom he starred in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series. Graham Greene provided an interesting twist as Maverick's Native American partner who is forced to play up to a Russian Archduke in order to make ends meet. <BR> But the climax was the poker game, watched over closely by James Garner and James Coburn where a few familiar faces from other Richard Donner movies make appearances and Maverick learns how good a card sharp he really is. Jodie Foster's sweet Southern Belle is obviously a fraud, but that's part of what made watching her con the title character so much fun. Obviously, the raunchy looking cowboys who attempt to leave Maverick for dead look as they do in order to compliment Gibson's attractiveness.<BR> In conclusion, Donner has given us a slick, masterful, action-filled, comedy that leaves the audience wanting more.
0679879269|3.0|I love the first two books in this series and read them both twice before beginning the last volume.  I won't be reading it again.  It took me forever to finish it.  What happened?  There is no thru-line and some scenes drag on forever.  The scene with Jorek mending the knife seemed to take days.  Too much filler, not enough action.  Some of it was wonderful (the gay(?) angels), some seemingly thrown away (the disappearance of the being in the crystal coffin) and much more implausibility overall than the first two books.  But the worst was the stiff upper lip British ending.  I guess Pullman's aim was to write &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; for the kiddie set.  I'm glad to put this one down.
B000002VCU|5.0|This perfect album of APP is one of my all time favourites!..<BR>There is not a single average song in the album. <BR>The arrangements are very good, the vocals of Chris Rainbow, Lenny Zakatek, and Eric Woolfson are great, the engineering is perfect as usual, and all the songs make a nice combination of a unique concept album. <BR>&quot;The Turn Of A Friendly Card&quot; deserves A 10 out of 10!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The first 20 minutes or so you will feel confused. But that's nothing... imagine living your life where maybe 20 minutes is all you can keep in your head... if that!<BR>The way this story is told keeps you learning things the way Lenny does - piece by piece, note by note, tattoo by puzzling tattoo.<BR>And when you finish this movie and immediately start it again you realize what an amazing piece of work it really is. For hours afterwards I felt the need to mark things down in notes to myself.<br />And that's saying nothing of the beautiful and dead on acting abilities of Guy Pearce. (Not once do you find yourself thinking of Felicia in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert!) Most of the time he seems a distant and more talented relative of Brad Pitt. Carrie Anne Moss is multifaceted and perfect as well.<br />This is one of those films you will find yourself forcing others to watch to see if they are as mesmerized as you were... and they will be.
B00005ATQ9|3.0|Firstly, I would like to say that I recognize Kubrick as a director with an amazing vision of how films should look, and he certainly portrays Redmond Barry's world with extreme beauty and an attention to detail never since achieved in any costume drama.<br />However, I must say that this is probably one of the most self-indulgent films I have ever seen. Kubrick films exude his unique style, however that is all there is to this film, Kubrick style. That is why I have given this film 3 stars. His talent for cinematography is unrivalled, and just for that this picture is worth three stars.<br />Films, however, need more than just a great score and cinematic artistry.  They also need interesting(not necessarily likebale) characters whom engage the audience.  I was at odds to find a character who earned my sympathy at all, even Barry's wife, whom is treated so abysmally by the protagonist, fails to gain any sympathy at all.  <br />The character of Barry is unlikebale at best, and throughout the film, his success and rise into the upper echelons of society is given to the fact that he is full of energy and determination. However O'Neal exhibits such a minute range of emotions that his energy is just non-existent. It's as if Kubrick told O'Neal just to make sure he looked gormless for three hours in order to repulse the audience. <br />This film is watchable because of Kubrick's talent, and unfortunately that is not quite enough for a film to hold one's attention for three hours. The story is so deliberately paced that I would only recommend this film to Kubrick fans interested in viewing his ability to create the world of Redmond Barry, albeit a very dull one.

B00005NW02|4.0|Why, oh WHY did this band have to add a second vocalist? Whoever this guy is, he certainly cannot stand up next to Serge. He might be good in another group, but he just doesn't fit in here.<br />As strange as it may sound, I think this album is too complicated. The first, with such simplistic (yet catchy) riffs, really caught my ears. This one ... well, it lacks the simple charm that SOAD's first had. (Listen to &quot;Sugar&quot; and then &quot;Chop Suey&quot; if you want to know what I'm talking about.)<br />This is a solid album, for sure, but don't expect D-Devil, Suite Pee, or any of the others. I'm sure I'll get the same old BS from people that support Metallica's change of direction, but I really hope that SOAD don't shift their sound so radically that it ends up sounding nothing like their first release. <br />&quot;Bounce&quot; and &quot;Prison Song&quot; are among the best (nix the second vocalist on &quot;Prison&quot;). <br />ICQ: 42007137 (&lt;--metal chicks only please ;)
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Finally, finally, FINALLY, Disney is releasing one of their films with a format, media and extras that do it justice. I'm an adult (most of the time), with no kids, but I still can't buy and receive this DVD soon enough; I think it has to be the best value of the year. I don't personally really care for Disney's more recent efforts, but there's no denying the magic of its early works, and Snow White is the perfect title to kick off this incredible-sounding Platinum Collection. <br />One thing that I have never been a fan of, though, has been Disney's marketing and sales schemes (VHS and DVD alike), and these Platinum titles, while finally doing justice to both the movies and the fans, will likely just add to the overall confusion for most buyers. The Limited Edition and Gold Collection DVD's already released are somewhat substandard; they are generally devoid of any extra DVD features and often are shortchanged technically (lack of widescreen or surround audio when available, etc.). They certainly don't hold a candle to the upcoming Platinums, which features tons of extras, innovative and wonderful-sounding DVD navigation schemes, incredible color and sound enhancement, and pretty much everything a fan could hope for in a Disney DVD. However, this being Disney, not everything could be good news of course, and with the Platinum Editions, the bad news comes with the ridiculous marketing plan for them; 1 per year for the next 10 years (Snow White being the first of 10). Until Disney to come to its senses and shortens that moronic release timeframe, however, we at least can have a taste of the incredible potential in this line with this first release.<br />Whether you were lucky enough to have a childhood touched by the magic of the early Disney classics, or if, like me, you weren't that lucky but have the alternate fortune of experiencing these titles for the first time with these mind-boggling Platinum Editions, this should be the easiest, most no-brainer DVD purchaseyou make all year. And for those able to pre-order and get another DVD for free (Limited/Gold Edition, but still), the deal becomes almost criminal to pass up. <br />Thank you, Disney, for what you're giving fans with this wonderful new line of Platinum titles.

B000000OTY|5.0|Back in 1993, the world tour following the release of the long-awaited &quot;US&quot; album by Peter Gabriel came in three different 'flavors' (just like with Pizzas): Large, Medium and Small. The small flavor would occur in places where Peter and his band would happen to play some of the songs from the track list, with any available instruments. The medium flavor would be like concert I had the opportunity of seeing in my home country (Venezuela): the band with their own instruments, playing the entire set, and using some of the visual effects that the larger production boasted (I have to say this 'mid-sized' version of the concert almost got me killed of a heart-attack -I'm not joking- due to all the emotions I experienced throughout it). The large 'flavor' was the one most northern hemisphere countries had a chance to enjoy, and what ended up registered in the video and the live album you're reading about here.<br />The band lineup is just as good as the one in Peter's previous live album 'Plays Live.' The drums, previously played by Jerry Marotta, are played by Mounsieur Manu Katche (also played with Sting, Eric Clapton and others); Jean Claude Naimro took the place of David Sancious (from the live So period); David Rhodes, Tony Levin, and -of course- PG were still part of the line-up; and Paula Cole (now famous for her albums Harbinger, This Fire and Amen) did beautiful backing vocals.<br />Particularly amazing are: the opening 'Come Talk to Me,' a true display of musicianship meant to get the crowd off their feet; ' the sinplicity and beauty of the rendition of 'Red Rain' and the musical strength of 'Digging in the Dirt,' 'Secret World' and 'In your Eyes,' bound for making the hairs in the back of your neck stand up.<br />Whether you've been following Peter Gabriel for his theatricals (when performing), his lyrics, his music, or a combination of all of the above, this concert simply belongs in your collection; no questions asked. Once you have it, you'll thank yourself for getting it!yourself for getting it!
B000005JA8|5.0|I owned this album as a kid in the early 1970s. I bought it again a few months ago on a whim. I honestly did not think that I would like it as much as I do. Usually when I listen to it, I'm doing computer code. It just seems to be great music to code to. What I like about CB's music is that it is very elaborate almost like the pieces of a very finely made Swiss watch. If you don't really listen to it, a lot of it seems like noise. But when you take time to listen to the music, you can hear very sophisticated melodies and rythms. TMR is probably CB's best work, definitely one of the high points of his musical writing career.
6303407188|5.0|I first saw this movie several years ago on a rainy Sunday when it was playing (for reasons unknown) repeatedly on a local channel.  The first time, I caught it in the middle but was so intrigued that I watched it again, and again.  At that time, I didn't have a VCR, so I rushed to the library wondering &quot;Who is this Ed Wood guy?&quot;  I was rather surprised to find, while thumbing through several biographies and interviews with those who knew him, that this movie was, for all intents and purposes, based on factual events (who would have believed it?).  Ed Wood was definitely a unique (albeit misled) individual.<br />I once saw (on a late-night &quot;best of schlock movies&quot; show) part of &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; and laughed uproarously -at the bad acting, bad script, etc.  However, I didn't watch it all.  I have since rented &quot;Ed Wood&quot; many, many times and, after begging my (skeptical) boyfriend to watch it with me, we later spent a whole night guffawing our way through &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; and &quot;Bride of the Atom&quot;.  Each was wonderfully horrid.<br />As for the movie &quot;Ed Wood&quot; itself, WONDERFUL!!!  Johnny Depp captures the idiosyncrasies of the man so well the viewer actually believes that he IS Ed Wood.  With a wonderful supporting cast, including Bill Murray and Martin Landau (his somewhat crochety portrayal of Lugosi definitely deserved the Oscar it won him) this movie is a definite 4-thumbs-and-two-toes-up gem.  Love the quotes!
B00003IPFK|4.0|While Lonesome Dove is an interesting film for adults, its lack of rating is problematic for families concerned with violence and adult themes. In this film, violence, both shown and described, includes murders, a scalping, an attempted rape, battery of a woman, and a threatened disemboweling. The dialogue includes repeated use of the words &quot;whore&quot; and &quot;poke&quot; (referring to intercourse). While I enjoyed the film and consider it well done, Lonesome Dove is not an appropriate film for my eight year old son, and I would never classify it as &quot;family&quot; film.
B000000OPU|5.0|Gabriel has enjoyed since the beginning of his solo career the company of some of the world's most brilliant musicians: some as sit-in session musicians, and some as part of his &quot;permanent&quot; band -such as the case of David Rhodes and Tony Levin. But the norm has been that all of them are extremely talented at performing with the instrument they play.<br />The album 'So' is no exception to this, with talents such as Kate Bush, Laurie Anderson and Youssou N'Dour, singing alongside Peter in &quot;Don't Give Up,&quot; &quot;This Is the Pictures (Excellent Birds),&quot; and &quot;In your Eyes&quot; respectively; Jerry Marotta (former member of the PG band), Manu Katche (now permanent drummer of PG), and Stewart Copeland (former Police drummer) taking turns with the drum kit; Daniel Lanois, co-producer of the album and guitar player; and long-time PG companions, David Rhodes and Tony Levin (one of the world's best, if no THE best bass and stick player). This is far from being an exhaustive list, I'd like to note, but you get the picture...<br />The album, though, is not about great musicians only, as you might guess. It's about great songwriting as well. Whoever deems this album as commercial because of the tracks &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; or &quot;Big Time&quot; obviously has not taken the time to listen to the lyrics, or see how the respective videos for the two themes are part of a larger picture, where Peter touches on the topics of sex and fame in a very clever way. But even (which they're not) if these two tracks were commercial in the plain sense of the word, there's so much more to this album: it's so dense in rich content, that I could spend hours reviewing it. The songs &quot;Red Rain,&quot; &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Mercy Street&quot; are just larger than life: they're songs that you'll be able to listen to in fifty years and the message they carry will still be alive.<br />To wrap this up, I'd like to leave behind one line taken from the song &quot;That voice again&quot; (not one of the famous, ah?) to give you an idea of the type of lyrical treasures you're bound to find in 'So': &quot;I come to you defenses down, with the trust of a child...&quot;&quot;That voice again&quot; (not one of the famous, ah?) to give you an idea of the type of lyrical treasures you're bound to find in 'So': &quot;I come to you defenses down, with the trust of a child...&quot;
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This film spawned yet another &quot;movie moniker&quot; for me: &quot;Schizophrenic Deja-Vu.&quot;  I can't think of a better description.<br />This is truly an enterprising way to choreograph a film - from the end, BACKWARDS to the beginning!<br />The disjointed way in which it is filmed gives you a pretty good feeling for what Leonard actually experiences as his life.<br />LOTS of plausible motives and suspects are developed throughout the film, so by the end (er, beginning) you STILL can't be sure you have it figured out - and chances are you won't anyway.  It's not exactly a suprise ending, but it wasn't expected either.  Or it was expected along with any of a half dozen OTHER possible endings.<br />You know those &quot;experimental&quot; films where audiences are given a chance to VOTE on where the plot goes, as it actually plays out?  Well, this would be one heck of a good candidate.  The movie could have gone in any of a dozen other directions and been as unique and compelling as ever.<br />The only down side to this was that of all the possible endings I was imagining, the actual ending was rather abrupt and sort of &quot;unfullfilling.&quot;  It was as if the director and screenwriter, having gotten this huge machine rolling downhill, couldn't think of a way to STOP it, so they just let it plow into the brick wall at the bottom.  Perhaps not too bad a solution, though.  Given the complexity of the screenplay, I can't imagine coming up with &quot;the one true ending&quot; that really settled it all.<br />Definately a riveter though.
6305165912|5.0|Just one of the best movies ever made!<BR>It's one of those movies that you will watch it the first time and think it is funny. But it is not until the second or third veiwing that you begin to really feel it.<BR>You will be saying the lines to everyone you know, its like a drug.<BR>How Jeff Bridges and John Goodmen did not both win an oscar I will never know. I can watch the scenes between them all night long.<BR>Just remember, the movie is about the DUDE.<BR>Try a fun drinking game of taking a sip everytime the 'f-word' is used or when they say 'dude'; take five when Walter says &quot;f&amp;*% it dude, lets go bowling&quot;.

0393317552|1.0|This book is the worst book I have ever read. It is slow and basically repeats the same message throughout each chapter. Whats the point? It's also to long and could be a great book for people who a lot of time to waste but i think it is written poorley and it a bore. If you need a bad book to put you to sleep this is it!
0515123447|5.0|Before I saw this book at the bookstore I had never heard of Lee Child.  I am glad a stumbled upon this book and the others he has written.  Jack Reacher, the main character is an ex-military drifter who seems to be just making his way around aimlessly.  He ends up in some sticky situations and making unlikely friends.<BR>If you like a good plot, quick pace and imaginative writing style you will like Lee Child's &quot;Killing Floor&quot;.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is beautiful. I can not begin to explain the greatness of<BR>this work of art that System of a Down has come with. With the masterpiece lyrics of Serij. Shavo's breath taking bass riffs. The melodies of Daren's guitars.The ear-shattering rythms of Jon's drumming. This CD is a must have for any hard rock or punk fan. My favorite song so far is \\"Deer Dance\\". I Highly suggest buying it if not for your own sake then for your ears sake.
6303014100|5.0|This is probably the best Civil War film yet made. The acting is , on the whole, excellent and the events are accurately portrayed. When attempting to make a movie like this the temptation to descend into commercialism must be strong indeed. This is entirely absent here. History is left to speak for itself, and rightly so. I wish the producers of the unspeakably bad &quot;U-571&quot; and &quot;The Patriot&quot; had taken a leaf from the same book. Sheen is brilliant as Lee. For me his best scene is when Lee reviews Pickett's division. With only facial expressions he totally captures Lee's character. Berenger,Jordan &amp; Daniels are teriffic as well. My only regret is that I did not see this film on the big screen. To the best of my knowledge it was only shown in two cinemas in London because of its length. A great shame. How about a movie about Patrick Cleburne? That great Confederate's life and career deserve the same treatment.
0380729407|2.0|I read this book for school and it was really confusing. Half the book didn't make sense. I dont suggest it because its real confusing. The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury is alot better. Because its easier to understand.
B0000025RI|5.0|Lets make one thing clear. I hate pop. It is typically uncreative and shallow. ...  However even an avid anti pop man came make an exception for this album.<BR>In my top 25 this mix of 80s dance pop and 70's funk it is at #7. Why not? Michael delivers a powerful and emotional classic. He delivers the two best songs (and best written) of his career in Beat It and Billie Jean. And Wanna Be Starting Something and Baby Be Mine are certainly some of the most underated songs in the Michael Jackson catalougue.<BR>And in his voice he expresses raw emotion on songs like Human Nature and The Lady in My Life.<BR>This certainly isn't void of weak points. P.Y.T. is not very spectacular and The Girl is Mine is just disgraceful. Though most is just amazing.<BR>Michael Jackson would never reach this peak in music greatness again. His other albums are inconsistent, and at times, even dated. (The only pop artist who can say only some of his music is dated.) So this is by far the greatest of Michael Jackson's career, a height very few have ever surpassed. (On my top 25 only Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles have better than albums than this effort. So Michael bashers give him credit. He did do this classic
0792833201|5.0|I'm not really into horror movies, but Poltergeist is in a class by itself.  Yea, it's a horror flick, however it's also hysterically funny in parts, and very moving in others.  Poltergeist was released about the same time as ET, and I think the phenomenal success of that film took away a lot of much-deserved attention and praise for Poltergeist.  This is a brilliant film.  A great story, stunning special effects and fine performances by all of the actors.  Most notably JoBeth Williams as the loving and caring mother.  It's amazing to me that she was not nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe.  Her performance is riveting, and she is pivotal in making an incredible story believable. <br />If you want to have a really enjoyable time being scared, don't miss seeing Poltergeist.  Even the term &quot;Modern Day Horror Classic&quot; doesn't do it justice.
B00000J7J4|5.0|If 8 grammys doesn't say it, I dont know what does!<br />This has got to be the best cd in the last century!<br />The only one track that I never care to listen and doesn't seem to fit in with the whole cd is Lauren Hills' rap song.
0671027344|5.0|This book is simply fantastic. The minute I finished it I couldn't decide whether to share it with someone else and let them read it, or read it again! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.
014100018X|1.0|This is a poorly written book about some sort of a magical woman and her daugher bringing &quot;happiness and freedom&quot; to a French village where they spend a period of time. Well, not that the idea itself is bad, but it has been used hundreds of times before in much better ways!! If you really want to have the solid version of this kind of tale, rent Mary Poppins for instance, and be happy and free...
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles almost defy genre.  They were the original boy band.  They're the most enduringly popular of pop groups.  They defined rock and roll as much as anyone ever will.  They slyly mastered the art of marketing and wryly marketed their mastery of art.  <br />Nowhere are these contradictions more apparent than in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their first album to be heavily influenced by Indian music and culture, the first album of nonstop continuous music (no grooves in the original record), and the first concept album.<br />This may be the best pop/rock album of the twentieth century.  It's almost certainly the most important.<br />--Ben
6305363668|5.0|This is one of the few movies that I rented, then bought immediatly. You just have to watch it several times. The visuals are stunning for the time, and the overall picture of the movie conveys is amazing. As for the comments that have been made about the directors cut, I prefer it to the original. Just taking out the voice over opens up the movie to a more 'spacey' feel. The last thing I want to have to do when I see a movie is have half the plot shoved right in my face, I would rather figure things out myself. The dvd could have been much much better. The picture quality is decent, but very lacking. No special features. I'm hoping for a re-release sometime in the near future. But I'm not complaining, its still far better than the vhs version.
B000002NAK|2.0|In contrast to the show's stellar Broadway run, the movie proved relatively disappointing: the added material perpetrated historical inaccuracies and made the show too pro-Evita.  The peculiar genius of this musical is that it balances the popularized image of &quot;Santa Evita,&quot; unblemished servant to the poor, with the gritty realism of Eva Peron, bloody wife to a tyrant.  The movie does not work because it ignores this delicate balance.<br />Madonna steals the show, of course, but she destroys it in the process.  This is not completely her fault: she is neither an untalented actress nor an unskilled singer.  However, someone decided that her Eva Peron--the most famous female fascist of the twentieth century--should be portrayed merely as a martyr, saint, and tragic heroine.<br />The only criticism Eva receives is from Che Guevara (Antonio Banderas: looks, 10; voice, 3).  Unlike the real Che Guevara, Banderas retains a cynical detachment and rarely sings with the passionate intensity of Mandy Patinkin (who played Che on Broadway).  Banderas' Che even kisses Evita's coffin at the end of the movie, an action insultingly out-of-character for a confirmed communist revolutionary.  Moreover, Jonathan Pryce, normally a wonderful performer, is strangely staid as Juan Peron.  Perhaps he was asked not to draw too much focus from the real star of the movie.<br />The Original Broadway Cast remains the essential recording of Evita.  Banderas' awkward warblings can't approach Mandy Patinkin's Tony-award-winning performance (perhaps the finest of his distinguished career), and Bob Gunton brings life and fervor to a role that for Jonathan Pryce (I'm sorry to say) is dull and lifeless.  Madonna's voice is less full-bodied than LuPone's, and she doesn't belt a single note.  However, she does bring a certain sensitivity and sensuality to the role, and some will no doubt prefer her performance.  <br />The soundtrack is a must-have for Madonna fans and a novelty item for musicalenthusiasts.<br />--Ben
B00005AAFS|5.0|I am predominantly a fan of classical, opera, and R&amp;B music, and have not, in the past, dug much rock music because the rock bands I had given my time to listen to did not evince any sonic individuality in their songs --- unlike the way all Ludwig van Beethoven symphonies, for example, share a common sonic/stylistic signature. On the contrary, most rock/metal albums sound like a sequence of hastily assembled noise-chunks with absolutely no art narrative to link them.<br />This is not the case with Rammstein. I first heard them via &quot;Engel&quot; on the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&quot; movie soundtrack, and since then I have become a firm fan. They are the only rock/industrial act I listen to, btw. Like I'd hinted above, what attracts a classical-music fan like me to the Rammstein sound is the (very) evident stylistic cohesiveness and sense of musical direction which pervade all three of their albums. Imho, all three albums - Herzeleid, Sehnsucht and Mutter - ARE modern operas backed by a heavy metal/industrial musical background. <br />And nowhere is this more so than in &quot;Mutter&quot; - their latest offering. I feel that this time around the band has truly gelled into a taut, cocksure musical unit, with the result that &quot;Mutter&quot; boasts a far surer sonic architecture than the other two albums put together. Each track flows seamlessly into its successor. For people just getting into Rammstein, I reckon they may initially find &quot;Mutter&quot; a tad &quot;bland&quot; in comparison with &quot;Herzeleid&quot; or &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, but that is ONLY because their tracks are more musically electic/diverse and so do not complement and merge into one another as effortlessly as those on &quot;Mutter&quot;. &quot;Mutter&quot; is one of those albums which yields their treasures only after several listenings. It is more satisfying and musically cogent than &quot;Herzeleid&quot; (itself an already outstanding album!!!) <br />My personal faves on this marvellous rock opera:- <br />Mein herz brennt<BR>Mutter<br />Feuer Frei<BR>Ich will<BR>Zwitter<br />Five stars all the way!<br />(PS: for those would summarily dismiss this modern work of art on the basis of a single listening session, I humbly advise you to do to yourself what Rammstein recommends in &quot;Zwitter&quot;. :-) :-) :-)
6302787556|5.0|Spike has outdone himself this time.  This three hour look at the great Malcolm X was rich and poignant.  Lee chronicles the leader's life from his younger days of hustling, through his jail term in which time he became a muslim, until the time of his ill-fated death in the Audubon Ballroom.  With this work, Lee brings you to laughter, to tears, to righteous indignation, and even to a silence as you process the depth of both Lee and X.  You certainly cannot overlook Denzel's award-winning portrayal of Malcolm X.  The similarity in looks is almost eerie and Washington captures the essence of the strong leader who eventually saw unfairness in some of his thoughts and ideas.  i cannot recommend this enough to anyone and everyone who wants to know about x, who question Lee as a director, and who just happens to love Denzel as much as I do!
0517543052|5.0|i read this book a couple of years ago.i cannot describe the change which has occurred in me since reading it. i am now a vegetarian,and i am living *the way*. after reading some others' reviews of this book, I was initially hurt &amp; offended by the negative reactions. then i realized that the person who was disappointed by the book must have had some expectations from it. this is natural; however; Baba Ram Dass does not proclaim to write of the &quot;truth&quot;. From a spiritual prospective;this is not a book which teaches *truth*. this is a book which causes one to look within oneself, and recognize the truths in everyday events. and again; one cannot say one is done with ones caterpillarness and is now ready to be a butterfly..one just becomes. the moment you give it up you can have it ALL. anyone who opens these pages with an intent to become &quot;realized&quot; or &quot;aware&quot; will be sadly disappointed, for the knowledge is conveyed so subtlely that one can NEVER see what one is not ready to see. an important thing to note before making the decision to live the &quot;right&quot; way...you cannot go back. once you SEE, once you SEE the right way vs. the wrong way...you are responsible for choosing the right path. and only you know if you are living the right way. this book was the start of a beautiful and eternal path I've chosen to make every day matter, and to really live in the Here and Now. this is not to say there will not be hang-ups...that there will not be obstacles.  the old saying goes, &quot;the higher you get, the harder you fall&quot; and this is true...but through the suffering, comes enlightenment. i welcome anyone's thoughts on this...i welcome a global realization of these ideas...but i recognize that we can all move only as fast as our slowest link. so, *help everyone*. :-)
B00005NW02|5.0|Dear God this has to be the greatest album of the year. No other band sounds anything like System of a Down. System has a unique sound and style all their own and this is ever more aparent in Toxicity. They match incredible lyrics with amazing instrumentals and vocals puting their original album to shame.
0140187537|5.0|As social commentary on the &quot;spirit of capitalism&quot; as it manifested itself in small towns in the coastal U.S. this is as good as it gets.  In stunning prose and articulate style, we are taken into the world of the mind of a man who was born into a world where he never felt he belonged.  Upon returning home after becoming a decorated war hero, the protagonist discovers that running the family businesses is a different ballgame.  After losing the &quot;family farm&quot; but keeping the house, this Ivy league literature graduate pines away tending shop for a successful Italian immigrant-entrepreneur.  Then one day he snaps and the story really begins.  Having taught several classes on political science and political economy, I can honestly say this is one of the best expositions of the pervasive power of capitalism to drive a good man to do &quot;ruthless&quot; things.  Never black and white, Steinbeck portrays an endless array of ethical dilemmas while keeping a nail-biting dramatic tension throughout. To the reader who chooses to put oneself in the character's shoes, there is much to be gained from an honest reading of this slim volume.  I can see why the Nobel committee considered this book to have put him over the top in earning the prize in 1961
B00003CXP1|5.0|Everyone comments on the excellent acting / storyline / filming of this film.   I agree with everyone on this score and for this reason alone I would recommend everyone seeing the film.   What amazed me is how true the picture was to the orginal story.  It is very difficult to make a film from a great story and keep true to the orginal book.   This film, however, does this and more.   It doesn't make it darker than the book, nor does it try to whitewash the harrowing parts of the book.  Great job.

0060920084|3.0|This is my third Bill Bryson book.  Thank goodness this was not my first, for I probably would not have picked up &quot;In a Sunburned Country,&quot; and &quot;A Walk In The Woods.&quot;<br />Where Bryson's latest books are droll, witty and endearing, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is frequently petty, forced and mean.  In this book Bryson travels around 38 states in a beat up Chevette, often through small towns and out of the way places not usually visited by many.  He didn't have a very good trip.<br />Most of this book revolves around the author's put-downs of people he sees and caustic comments about places he visits.  After a few hundred pages, the observations seem awfully gratuitous.  Where disappointments, angst and difficult people were treated with amusement in his later books, here he often dismisses similar trials here with the brilliant and trenchant observation &quot;FU&quot;.  Not much authorship in those moments.<br />Not to say that there aren't some funny passages.  Several times on the train, I found myself reading out loud.  However, I also found myself speed reading ahead several times, an unfortunate first for a Bryson Book.  Bryson's later works also weave a good deal of interesting historical background and place descriptions into the book.  That is almost totally missing in this effort.<br />He occasionally comes up with some awfully good writing.  For example, he described driving toward the mountains in Colorado as &quot;driving into the opening credits of a Paramount Picture.&quot; (sic).  Unfortunately, there are not enough of those moments and instead too many paragraphs describing how he had another bad meal in another bad town with too many ice cream and pizza parlors and not enough ambiance or fetching waitresses to suit his tastes.  Bryson has produced much better.  But don't let this book (or review) put you off an author whose books can be very satisfying companions.  Just go for his more recent stuff.
0446677450|3.0|I had heard of this book but did not have any inclination to buy it. Then a couple of weeks ago I got stuck in Penn Station for an hour because a train broke down in one of the tunnels.  Passing the time in Penn Books, I saw this book prominently displayed and giving the cover a quick read, decided to purchase it.<br />I wil start out with what is good about this book.  Kiyosaki repeatedly points out that too many Americans are essentially financial illiterates, which I would have to agree with.  He talks about the need to educate yourself by reading books and attending seminars about investing in the stock market or in real estate.  This I have resolved to do, and if I got anything at all from Rich Dad, Poor Dad, it was the inspiration to educate myself about these things, which I have begun to do.<br />That being said, this book is shoddily written and edited.  I spotted numerous grammar and spelling errors.  I have read critics of Kiyosaki who say that much of what he says regarding real estate investing and corporations has a shaky legal foundation.  One critic even set forth a convincing case that Kiyosaki was not particularly wealthy until he started turning out all of his Rich Dad Poor Dad books.  Apparently he was even homeless for a while in the 1980's.<br />In summary, I would say borrow this book from the library, use it to get yourself fired up about the prospect of investing in stocks and real estate, return the book to the library, and then buy books from recognized experts in these fields and follow their advice.
0743216458|5.0|Very well written. Ambrose tells an absorbing tale of what the war was like to men who fought it. I could not put it down.<br />This book is a good compliment to Ambrose's &quot;Citizen Soldiers.&quot; In that book, Ambrose takes a look at the condition of the G.I. in Europe as a whole. While offering interesting personal accounts, it is intended as a survey of all soldiers and as such is somewhat impersonal (although very good).<br />Band of Brothers, on the other hand, is intimate and personal. By following one command (E Co., 506 / 101st Airborne) across France and into Germany, we get to see a discrete group of soldiers adjust to changing conditions brought on by different seasons, terrain, offensive and defensive actions, their own increasing battle savvy and fatigue. I like this approach. By personalizing the experience of a few front-line soldiers, the impact on the reader is enhanced because one comes to know the characters. They are not just &quot;some soldiers who experienced frost bite,&quot; they are individuals we've come to know who looked with the pride of conquerors as they stood in Hitler's Eagle's Nest, a fitting end to their fatigue, loss and heroics in liberating a continent.<br />This outfit in particular offers lots of adventure, which is I am sure why Ambrose chose them. Part of the 101st Airborne, E Co., was at Utah Beach, the Battle of Arnhem, the Battle of the Bulge, helped liberate a concentration camp in addition to securing Hitler's Bavarian retreat. As we get to know these Americans through their battles and experiences, we more fully appreciate how our &quot;regular guys&quot; helped conquer self-designed supermen bent on world domination.<br />This book moves very quickly, is highly entertaining and moving. Watch out, you may want to read this ground level WW II account in one sitting
B00005J6UP|5.0|By now, we all know the story of \\"The Goonies:\\"  A band of young kids are in the final hours of hope as their houses will soon be torn down to make way for a country club owned by the \\"Richest man in Astoria.\\"  Then, as if by divine intervention, Mike(y) Walsh (Sean Astin) finds a treasure map in his parent's attic, and bands together with his friends, his older brother, and two girls, to find the treasure and save the \\"Goondocks.\\"<br />  This DVD release was carefully planned and masterminded by someone rather skillfully.  If it hadn't been for those who knew the potential this DVD had for the many loyal fans, we may have been stuck with nothing more than 2 different language subtitles and the theatrical trailer.  This DVD delivers in the realm of several interesting areas:<br /> 1)Audio/Video commentary by the cast: Probably one of the most innovative ways for comentary, as we see and hear Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jonathan Ke Quan, and even director Richard Donner give their views.  And even with the comentary, Corey Feldman still embodies the spirit of his character \\"Mouth\\": the fact is that he seems to never shut up throught the entire commentary.  Some interesting articles get covered up in some areas as some people try to say things but give up when someone else intervenes.<br />  2)\\"The Goonies R Good Enough\\" music video by Cyndi Lauper.  Yep, Cyndi Lauper in all her colored haired glory, this time acting in quite a nutty take as her Mom and Pop's gas station is going to be overtaken by greedy corporate types, until she uncovers a secret cave, where she meets the Goonies, and a number of crazies (pirates, a green-faced witch, etc) all search for an ancient treasure.  Steven Spielberg even makes a brief cameo.  <br /> 3)Making of the Goonies-a 7 minute segment on the film, shot back in 1985, very brief, but does show interesting scenes, such as filming inside a \\"Snack-shop,\\" and a police car chase shot that was omitted.<br /> 4)Outtakes-this title is misleading, as you may think it was the kids flubbing their lines.  Actually, it contains 3 scenes, including the deleted snack-shop sequence, a further dissection of One-Eyed Willy's treasure map, and then the gang's encounter with a giant octopus.<br /> 5)Page layout: the main screen looks like the caverns, and really captures the movie instead of a static image, any direction you go will cause something on the menu to happen.<br />  Even with 5 stars, there will always be things that we, the fans of the Goonies, will always wish to see.  Talked about on the commentary was the possible fact of an extended police chase, and gorillas getting loose in the film.  But still, the film holds up much better in today's world of terribly bad PG-rated features.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This film, easily the most original film (the only other candidate being &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;) of the past ten years, is also probably the best film made so far this year. It relies on the most treacherous and damning of human aspects--memory--to not only confuse our desperate protagonist, but also ourselves.<BR>Beginning on a disconcerting note, the film shows a man being killed, and then runs backwards, scene by scene, in ten minute segments. The film becomes not so much as a &quot;whodunit&quot; but more of a &quot;whydunit&quot; and &quot;howdunit.&quot; It explains how a man without any short-term memory named Leonard has come to be in California, looking for his wife's murderer. The only things on his side are Polaroids with notes scribbled under them to remind him of important people and things, important &quot;facts&quot; tattooed on his body, and two people of questionable motive named Natalie and Teddy.<BR>This is a film where you need to sit down and stay down. If you get up to use the bathroom, I promise you'll miss something crucial (and you'll want to remember everything you can for the astonishing, much-debated ending). If you stop halfway through and try to finish later, you'll have probably forgotten many seemingly insignificant, though undoubtedly important, little bits of information.<BR>Technically, the film is exceptional. The music and cinematography is first-rate, making California look like a bleached, bleak cesspool (the finer elements of Man are totally ignored here). Guy Pearce conveys phenomenal depth and range as the desperate, troubled, yet wry Leonard. Carrie Ann-Moss (almost wholly unrecognizable after &quot;The Matrix&quot;) shines as the bitter, yet tender Natalie. Joe Pantoliano, of course, plays Teddy utterly to hell. It's a magnificent performance, and one that well deserves award recognition.<BR>This film is by no means for everyone. Some of it is very intense, and it certainly will mess with your mind. But for all those patient and willing enough to sit through it, think about it, and give it a chance, it will prove to be that most rare type of film: a film that proves as intellectually stimulating and challenging as it does entertaining.
B00005AWMF|5.0|This is a collection of all of Sade's singles. I think Sade is a wonderful artist. Her music is so beautiful. There is nobody else like her. She is truley Blessed. Her music is so full of feeling. She talks about all the things that have happened to her in her life and things that have happened to people she knows. She talks about how she used to live in a way worse country. She escaped and came to America. If she goes back she will be arrested and put in to jail. She talks about all of this in certain songs on this collection. She also talks about people she knows who still live there. She also has other songs about love, death, and heart break. You feel so much when you listen to her. Her music can really touch your heart, deep down inside. Songs like &quot;Jezebelle&quot; and &quot;Pearls&quot; talk about people she used to know who still live in the country she escaped from. She also has other smooth and beautiful relaxing songs like &quot;The Sweetest Taboo&quot;, &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot;, and &quot;Cherish The Day&quot;. I love Sade I really recomend this album. Please buy it. It is most definitley worth the money.
B00005KFUM|5.0|If you liked Showbiz, then go out and buy this album straight away.  Origin Of Symmetry is full of top class songs like Plug In Baby, Bliss, New Born (all single releases) Feeling Good and Space Dementia.  Muse have managed to incease their brilliance and top their first album which showed that they were a promising upcoming band
B0000024SD|5.0|Leaping out of the speakers, &quot;Subteranean Homesick Blues&quot; is a blistering rap song by the then new &quot;folk-rock&quot; messiah, a lightening diatribe/warning aimed at the emerging youth culture.  Alternating this full throttle sound, (along with &quot;Maggies Farm&quot;), with beautifully melodic and poetically maturing love songs, (&quot;She Belongs to Me&quot; and &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot;), Dylan created a finely honed balance of his increasingly personal vision. The absurdist &amp; surreal storylines of, &quot;On the Road Again&quot; and &quot;Bob Dylans 115th Dream&quot;, are all populated with a nearly exhausting array of bizzare characters, all attempting to crash in on the singers world.  He sings, &quot;Mr Tambourine Man&quot;, with a wearily emotive voice, more perfectly suited to the lyrics than The Byrds hit version.  &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;, stands as a horrific visionary piece of existential poetry, but for me the centerpiece remains, &quot;It's Alright Ma(I'm Only Bleeding).  This &quot;song&quot; gets to the heart of the matter in concisely rhymed and purposely forged words.  It is a one of a kind personal manifesto. The song cycle ends with the hopeful and forward looking, &quot;It's All Over Now Baby Blue&quot;, a perfect, sympathetic closer.  The liner notes, (if still included on cd?), are worth the price of admission.  In a word...brilliant.
B00004U8JU|5.0|An outsatnding idea from Michael Crichton, about finding away to &quot;re-create&quot; dinasours on an un-inhabited island, an excellent cast including Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Samuel.L.Jackson, and the great Jeff Goldblum, directed by talented Steven Speildberg, and great music by John Williams.  The most original idea of its time, a movie about dinasours in our century of living, of corse everything goes wrong, not to mention with the help of sneaky Nedry, and the viewers become in complete danger as all of the dinosaurs break lose.  Great Special effects, the dinosaurs almost look real [ if we only knew exactly how they looked ]bringing life to the surroundings, which were incredible, 60 minutes of footage of behinf the scenes and the location they shot the movie in, with great picture quality and sound, worth a Roaring Look!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Regarding the movie, it is certainly worthwhile to watch. Be sure to set some extra time aside after the movie as you'll likely want to watch certain things again.<br />Regarding the special features. Where are they? My disc doesn't have any. I checked everything multiple times looking for the commentary that some people refer to, and for the trailer that is mentioned. It doesn't appear to be on my disc.<br />There is one thing on the disc that makes up for that. (MINOR SPOILER if you haven't seen the movie.)<br />On the main menu there is a heading that is crossed out. There's a good reason for it to be crossed out. If it wasn't it would give something away. The only time I'd even heard about this movie was from IMDB's listing of the top 250 movies, so I didn't know about the unusual technique it employs.<br />The special feature that some reviews have mentioned would be nice is what this is for. It certainly makes it easier to rewatch. If you've seen the movie, you'll know what this is.<br />I do feel that commentary and other special features would enhance the disc.  The UPC for this disc is 65935 13781 and it's Authorized for sale in Canada only.
0060392886|5.0|I was riveted by the honesty of this book. It was both poignant and gritty, sometimes so pathetic, it became difficult to read on, but like a car wreck that you pass on the highway, you are compelled to look. I commend the boys for putting out their dirty laundry for all of us to see. More celebrities should be so forthcoming.
0060283122|4.0|At the opening of this book, the author tells you that this is NOT a happy book. And he's not kidding. I can see where this would have great appeal as a children/young adult book, and I think it is very clever.<BR>However, when I buy kids books, my wife and I are looking for something fun to read to each other in bed, and this was just a bit too depressing for me. My wife loved it (in fact, she knew the author in college at Wesleyan, which was a pretty weird coincidence... Dan -- Mo say hi! )<BR>I would recommend it to any child looking for something a bit more off the wall than Harry Potter.
B00005NW02|4.0|System of a Down's debut is a metal masterpiece, and was definitely the best metal album released in 1998 in my opinion. So there was no way Toxicity could top it, and doesn't. But what an interesting metal stew it is: Slayeresque guitars (the album is co-produced by Slayer producer Rick Rubin), spurts of punk rock aggression, vocals that go from &quot;normal&quot; almost folk style singing to screeching and back again. The perfect example of all these influences is &quot;Deer Dance&quot;, which i hope will be released as a single. It's probably too strange for radio, but then again, &quot;Chop Suey&quot; was released as the first single so anything's possible. This group should be applauded for at least being different and unique. Some lyrics on some songs i'm reminded of Rage Against the Machine, while others remind me of the weirdness of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. Serious ranting about science and prisons are scattered among songs that are either tongue in cheek weirdness, or from the mind of a truly psychologically bent individual. Either way, this cd makes for an entertaining listen. The worst offense an album can do is being boring, and that is one thing this band is not. Overall, an okay followup. If you don't have the self titled debut though, i recommend that you get that first.

B000021YQV|5.0|While most are ranting and raving about the new Slipknot CD (Iowa) the album that should be getting the praise and respect is System Of A Down - Toxicity. Rick Rubin has produced a fine piece of work in \\"Toxicity\\" by letting SOAD continue where they left off from their vastly underrated (in my opinion) self titled debut from almost 3 years ago. It's amazing how you can take a band like Slipknot, who technically is on an independant label(Roadrunner Records - as far as I know they've never come out to say they're a major label but I could be wrong) and they put out what I feel is a weak effort when compared to their first album. Let's face it, the heavier tracks on that CD seem to be on there to satisfy die hard Slipknot fans while most of the tracks are tailor made for radio airplay. Whereas with System Of A Down, there's barely any radio friendly tracks on the CD and not only are they on a Major Label who would like nothing more than to have and album full of hits but they have one of the best producers in the world who's helped produce top 10 hits for the Chili Peppers but SOAD manage to stay true to their artform while teetering very little to a Radio friendly sound. Besides the current single \\"Chop Suey!\\", what else can possibly be released as a single and actually played on MTV as well? I honestly don't see any other songs on this album becoming big radio hits or (dare I say) TRL picks of the week. With this album it's almost impossible and that's what's so great about it! Top to bottom this is a perfect CD! Lyrically it's great as well as musically. Everyone involved in the band puts in a great performance on every single track. An absolute MUST buy!! If this album dosen't sell millions of copies, I'm giving up hope that real Metal fans truly exist. Highlights include \\"Prison Song\\", \\"Needles\\", \\"Jet Pilot\\", \\"Chop Suey! (of course)\\", \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Psycho\\". I can't wait for the 3rd album!! Let's just hope we don't have to wait 3 years for it :-) Also for fans of Rick Rubin, the new Slayer album is out as well. These are 2 Rick Rubin masterpieces released in one Month. True Metal for True Metal fans!f Rick Rubin, the new Slayer album is out as well. These are 2 Rick Rubin masterpieces released in one Month. True Metal for True Metal fans!
6302561841|5.0|Watching Modern Times does show how great Chaplin was at directing movies. Before watching Modern Times, I thought that Chaplin just did some simple silent comodies and skits. However, Modern Times shows that he can do more and that he can sucessully convey meaning through this meaning. It was interesting to see how he was able to convey the lifelesness of factory work and of modern society.
0451457994|4.0|The amazing thing about this book is that it isn't dated.  I mean, the internet, for instance.  Art didn't see the form we have today, but he did forsee e-newspapers.  The plot wears well, and reminds us how the world was in the '80's, we thought they would push the button and turn the key, and blow civilization away long before now.  Mr. Clarke's solution to the problem is unique, to say the least.

0375703764|2.0|This book was quite disappointing. I was looking for good scare, and how scared was I? Not at all. I understand why the typesetting was messed with, but I don't think it added much to the book, other than increasing my annoyance. I think better written passages would have conveyed much more. Turning a book upside down and sideways does not equate to good literature. The typesetting and footnotes are used here to spice up a fairly dull story. It's not awful awful awful, but I've read better.
B00004TL21|4.0|A couple of years ago it was hard to tell boy bands apart, now its becoming increasingly hard to determine which heavy metal band you're listening to when they come on the radio.  This is not the case for the Deftones though, they have beautiful lyrics with trippy beats that make this album one of the most distinguished of the slew of heavy/rap metal albums being pumped out these days.
B00004TJLD|1.0|I purchased this disc thinking that it was a DVD-Audio disc. My first clue was the non DVD-Audio case that the cd comes in. The second clue was the blue light that failed to come on indicating a DVD-Audio track. This disc is a DAD (Digital Audio Disc). It is mastered at a higher rate than regular cd but contains no multi-channel information. It still must be played on a DVD video player through the 5.1 channel inputs. For the price, this disc should be a lot more.
B00005NW02|3.0|This band would be so much better if they would give up the sudden loud outbursts. These are good in some contexts, but the subtler parts on this cd are often laughably juxtaposed against a sudden screaming chorus. See the song  &quot;Atwa&quot;
B00004NRUM|4.0|Of all the post-Fish Marillion cd's I've heard, this is one that is the most interesting and one that I can actually tolerate those god-awful vocals of Steve Hogarth. True the man can write great songs, but that voice takes some getting used to when compared to Fish, jeez...that's not a fair comparison. There is some great signature Marillion playing here unlike later releases and some memorable tracks- 'Living with the big lie', 'Alone again in the lap of luxury', 'Runaway' are a few. It may take a few spins before it grows on you(for me it took many spins)but if you listen primarily to the music, you'll dig it.
B00005NW02|5.0|This is such a great CD.  More melodic tunes than their last album..but heavy at the same time.  My favorite song has to be Chop Suey! followed by Deer Dance and Jet Pilot.  Serj has a one of a kind voice.  I haven't checked out the Cd-rom yet..but I bet it's great.  This is a must-have CD.
6303460151|3.0|And that about sums up what I have to say about &quot;Pret a Porter&quot;. Worst part: Julia Roberts (I wish the rest of America would get wise to her lack of talent). Best part: Seeing Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni reunite. Marcello was her old beau, and now they have a second chance at love, about 40 years late. I laughed out loud at their scenes, cursed the darkness that is Julia Roberts.<br />Try on &quot;Ready to Wear/Pret a Porter&quot; and see how the fit suits you.
B00003Q43A|2.0|This movie was \\"OK\\" (it came out during the Clinton Presidency, so when they blew up the White House there was quite a bit of cheering in the theater - you do have to appreciate that), but the story isn't original. I personally like the 50s Sci Fi movies myself, and the War of the Worlds was a much more interesting movie than this expensive remake. (Let's go to the original book by H. G. Wells to see how old this story really is). War of the Worlds was certainly was a more suspenseful movie. Can't Hollywood come up with anything original anymore? The special effects in this were good, no doubt about that, but they weren't really believable (name one person that you know that can outrun an explosion in a tunnel). That's Hollywood for you. <br />For excitement and effects, this is a movie that is worth watching. If it's a good story with suspense and a little bit of intelligence that you want to see, than the original War of the Worlds is a much better choice. I think that Gene Barry is a much better actor than Will Smith is and his character was more interesting than the Will Smith character we have in this version of the film. Gene Barry was scared and unsure of the outcome of the invasion in the original (lets face it, he lost all hope but fought to the end and never gave up and understood that the defeat was due to a higher power than man and science) and Will Smith's character was cocky and sure that we could win in Independence Day. Unlike War of the Worlds, there was no doubt how this story would end in this version. It would be nice for Hollywood to have an ounce of creativity and originality in making movies these days, but they won't do that. Hollywood even had to resort to a computer \\"virus\\" to defeat the alien invasion in this version rather than a cold virus from the original. Couldn't they come up with another way for the human race to prevail? They rely on special effects to sell tickets. The amount they spend on one explosion could certainly pay for awriter with talent and ability. <br />All in all, I would rather watch something else. All of the remakes of the 50's Sci Fi movies...
B00004VVNC|1.0|Boy, this is one silly movie! Now answer truthfully, If your lover pulled a knife on you in bed, wouldn't that be the end of your relationship? Well, that's the kind of stuff going on in this incredibly unbelievable movie. This was my first Brad Pitt movie, and I just don't see what all the hoopla is about. And check out Anthony Hopkins--even after he strokes out, he's still pulling his rifle out on people!<br />One legend that doesn't merit perpetuating.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Despite the appearance of the lackluster cardboard case, The Goonies DVD is a must for any fan of this classic family adventure film. The high points of this edition are an inventive and colorful selection menu, the excellent transfer print of the film used, and the feature-length audio commentary, which reunites the entire child-star cast of the film! They've even gone so far as to include both parts of the promotional Cindy Lauper &quot;Its Good Enough&quot; video that ran its course back in the good-old days, when MTV played music videos.<br />The DVD is far from perfect, however, and there are a few minor disappointments. First, the audio commentary occasional switches from the movie to an in-studio shot of the actors discussing the film, which I personally found a bit distracting, although others may disagree. And while they take great pains to show the cast members talking, there are no filmographies or bios included in the Cast &amp; Crew section, an excellent opportunity for a &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; moment. Finally, while some deleted scenes are included with the extras, the cast invariably makes mention throughout the commentary of numerous scenes filmed that are not shown, even in rough form. Its always a let-down when a seven-hour rough cut is alluded to, yet only five minutes worth of deleted scenes (and no outtakes) make it onto the disc.<br />But these are all minor complaints, and in no way detract from one of the greatest kid's films ever made! Even if this DVD were a bare-bones release, it would still be worth picking up!
6304385668|3.0|&quot;Michael Collins&quot; tells the story of one of Ireland's great patriots, who as a young man had a part in the Easter Rising of 1916, and then battled the British guerilla-style up through the establishment of the Free State before being murdered himself.<br />Liam Neeson does a fine job as Collins, but there are two BAD performances in the film which hurt its overall effectiveness. First, Julia Roberts does a terrible job as the woman Collins loves. Bad brogue and just bad attitude. Then Alan Rickman, who I thought did splendid work in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is perfectly horrid as Eamonn DaValera. The scene where he makes an imprint of his jail key is so ludicrous, it looked like camp. Also, the film suggests that DaValera had a hand in Collins' murder, which undercuts the importance of DaValera himself as an Irish patriot, long-time President of the country.<br />Best for Neeson and daring escapes from the Black and Tans.
6305165912|5.0|This is really an interesting movie. Probably one of the most interesting and funny movies that I've ever seen. Joel and Ethan Coel certainly have very interesting minds (as seen in this movie and other movies of theirs like Fargo). The story of Jeffrey &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski and how his identity gets all mixed up with a different Jeffrey Lebowski is really interesting. Especially when a kidnapping situation comes up and The Dude becomes the center of things. And the use of torn off body parts (the nail-polished toe, John Goodman's character biting off an ear, and The Dude worrying about someone cutting off his &quot;johnson&quot;) keeps the story interesting. The character of Maude Lebowski (not related to The Dude since they end up conceiving a kid) is quite interesting. Maude's artistic way of expressing herself by flying through the room naked on a harness and throwing paint down onto a canvas while in the air is really awesome. Julianne Moore did a great job handling an English accent and that high-pitched laugh that she shares with her friend and the friend on the phone is almost humorous. John Goodman's Walter is probably the most interesting character of all. And that's mostly due to Goodman's superb acting. When you see him, you think of Dan from &quot;Roseanne&quot; but when he talks in this movie, yes he uses lots of profanity but the way he talks is so precise and intelligent. And you gotta love the scene when he and The Dude go to dump their friend's ashes in the ocean and as he pours the ashes into the direction of the water, the wind picks up and sends the ashes flowing behind him and land on The Dude. So in short, this movie is an intelligent, creative, funny must-see movie for anyone who likes to laugh.
0792151712|3.0|I saw &quot;Titanic&quot; in the movie house three separate times, and all of those times, I just was enthralled by the special effects and the scope of the movie. Then, when it became available, I rented it to show my family members who hadn't gotten around to seeing it. The result? The Incredible Shrinking Movie.<br />Ever have that experience? How come it seemed so great in the movies, but at home, no? Now don't get me wrong: the special effects still worked fine, but what really hit me was how shallow the two main actors were. I hadn't realized it in the theatre, but now it was plain as day that their characters were selfish and self-seeking at all times. This version of the Titanic story was the only one that left out any of the real-life human interest stories about self-sacrifice on the part of the passengers. All we saw was Jack and Rose trying to get themselves off the ship, period. No help to anyone else. Are we supposed to infer that director Cameron disbelieved that the real-life people were truly capable of nobility, and that's why he totally ignored that aspect of the history? Too bad if so, because that's really what always captures our interest about this disaster, that people in such dire circumstances retained their humanity to such an extent and in many cases laid down their lives for another's. The Titanic story is the story of many individuals, not just one big mob or indiscriminant group of people killed in an air crash. That's why it's so compelling all these years later, because ideals are timeless.<br />Back to the movie. By the way, I hated that Gloria Stuart. So she was old, so what? That didn't make her a good actress. I think Cameron ought to have gotten an old actress who actually looks something like Winslet, such as Olivia de Havilland. Kate and Leonardo were a very young couple, but I didn't mind that. I was gladdest of all to see that one of the upper crust British gents was played by Bernard Fox, Dr. Bombay from &quot;Bewitched&quot;.<br />So, in the end, I would consider making my own tape of &quot;Titanic&quot; rather than buying it, because I would seriously want to cut Gloria Stuart out. Otherwise, I was sorry that I wasn't able to enjoy it as much out of the theatre as in.
B00005KHJV|5.0|FINALLY! After the billion rereleases of this movie, rehashing the same stuff we knew about for years, they finally release the version any Halloween fan has been dying for! This version was only available if you recorded it off of TV, but not anymore! Finally, a version of the movie you've seen a thousand times already with some stuff that make the movie worth seeing again!
6304057709|5.0|When Marianne (Kate Winslet) seeks to reproach her sister Elinor (Emma Thompson) on that score, watch out! The normally repressed and sedate Elinor, always choosing her words carefully and weighing them before she speaks, bursts out with a tirade against Marianne that almost draws applause from the viewer. <br />It's not that we don't like Marianne; on the contrary, she is herself quite loveable. It's just that at last to see Elinor give way to the turmoil she feels inside is a catharsis for everybody. She's had a very hard time of it, too. First, her father died leaving her, Marianne, their younger sister, and mother destitute and dependent upon others' kindnesses. Then she forms an attachment to her sister-in-law's brother Edward (Hugh Grant_, but when it seems certain he will propose, zilch. Along the way, she is the recipient of a confidence she doesn't want which cuts her to the quick.<br />And Marianne? Well, she has the unwanted attentions of Captain Brandon (Alan Rickman) to contend with, until she is literally swept off her feet by the romantic Willoughby. THEIR engagement seems a done deal, when suddenly, zilch again!<br />Jane Austen was a master at presenting a story which appears to have no happy ending, a story where you suddenly realize you're as blind as the heroine about what is REALLY going on. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is a wonderful adaptation of her great novel, the precursor to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Everything works: the casting, the countryside, everything. And those last two scenes are the classic fairy tale ending, absolutely the sweeter for having gone through so much. <br />Demonstrate your good sense, and check out &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; as soon as time permits.
B00005221L|4.0|Forget about Terminator and about the clones!!! If you are an Arnold fan this is the movie for you!!!! PREDATOR is the movie you should get.<br />The supporting cast is well accomplished by Carl Weathers (Rocky series), Jesse Ventura (former wrestler and governor) and Bill Duke (American Gigolo) who works with the Dutch (Arnold S.) on retrieving some hostages, there they will meet their doom at the hands of some fierce alien, who hunts for pleasure, except for Arnold who will battle the alien to the death.<br />The only problem with this DVD, is not the movie is the fact that we only have 1 extra: the trailer!!! I mean no interviews, no lost scenes or behind the scenes...nothing!!!! besides that the movie rocks for itself!!!
B00001IVOF|5.0|My favorite track is &quot;In the long run&quot;. But lissen! How could I pick a fav from these songs? I can't! Cuz every track is bangin. For real! It's a lassic! The Mobb is on point! Real hip hop!
0679879269|2.0|...he really is.  I'm sure C. S. Lewis would be grieved beyond belief to read these books.  They are fairly well written (dispite some pretty obvious plot-holes).  I really like how he uses the idea of &quot;daemons.&quot;  However, there is no way I would recommend this trilogy to any of my students - they're definately not childrens' books.  Pullman seems to have a huge axe to grind against the Catholic church, and this might offend some people greatly.  However, if sloppy theology doesn't bother you, you might like these books.
B00005NW02|5.0|On renowned avant-garde metal maestros System of a Downs sophomore effort, Toxicity, Metal and Melody are joined together in sonic matrimony. It is an astonishing mixture, and while it might be a little hard at first to swallow for the ears, it certainly pushes the envelope behind the mainstream conventions of modern metal. Rather than stick to the MTV-staple of rap-rock, Toxicity mixes an almost Mediterranean/Middle Eastern feel with pounding guitar riffs, by Systems producer and main songwriter Daron Malakian, on songs like the single, Chop Suey! and Science.<br />However, the melody is not only played, but also sung with great emphasis by vocalist virtuoso Serj Tankian, who has an explosively bombastic-like delivery. On songs like ATWA and the haunting album closer, Aerials, he demonstrates his talent not by his shouting, but showing to the world that he truly has the voice of a classic vocalist. His lyrics although not all the time coherent as in Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot/One that smiled when he flew over the bay, they do usually have a message behind them as in Prison Song, a revealing look on the Drug-War situation in our country today. Beyond the Staples Center you can see America with its tired, poor, avenging disgrace/Peaceful loving youth against the brutality of plastic existence, sings Tankian on Deer Dance. Lyrics such as these serve as a powerful reminder in the important issues that face our country today.<br />Unlike their counterparts (Papa Roach, Slipknot) in contemporary music, they show a higher much level of musical maturity. Not merely whining about adolescent issues like Limp Bizkit, they know how to have fun and be creative at the same time. System of a Down was quoted in Rolling Stone that they want to see music evolve. The evolution has begun. Who will be brave enough as these audacious Armenians to take the next to step forward? Only time will tell, and if these guys make the mainstream, you can bet that Backstreet and Britneys time is almost over. So with that, get ready and make way for the evolution!
B000056K04|3.0|Compared to earlier albums, the music is tighter, more professional; but there's a definite loss of joy. I'm not a Dave fan, but I enjoyed &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; for its generosity of spirit that let me set aside my disagreements with his philosophies and just groove to the wonderful worldbeat-tinged jazz-rock. &quot;Everyday&quot; lacks that spirit. I have to wonder how so many of these songs can preach love and yet sound so cold and mean. Might be a high concept. Or might just be an unfortunate mismatch of time and place and material. Hopefully all those Dave fans out there who look to him for guidance about love and joy and spirit find those qualities in these songs when they hear them live. Because to my ear it's cold in the studio.
B0000062Y2|5.0|If you love Andrew Lloyd Webber's movie Jesus Christ Superstar it is probably because of the music. I have heard many recordings but what I really wanted was the voices I heard in the movie. Carl Anderson(Judas Iscariot)has an unforgetable passion. Mary Magdalene(performed by Yvonne Elliman) has a beautiful quality of voice. This recording may seem raw to some listeners, but it parallels the movie in that respect. If you are looking for the sounds and mental images of the motion picture this album is a must.
B0000019PA|4.0|These guys take a real kitchen-sink approach to their songwriting and instrumentation that certainly keeps things interesting. There are some perversities here - saturated recording levels, harshly bad singing - but it works in a strange way as part of the aesthetic.<br />Another Amazon reviewer made a comparison with Roy Harper and they're dead right. &quot;Oh Comely&quot; is virtually a Harper impersonation.
B00005K3NY|3.0|This is one of Cronenburg's best efforts--imaginative and very entertaining.  Unfortunately, the DVD edition is not-so-hot (the stars reflect the DVD quality, not the film itself). The last forth of the movie has a terrible soundtrack matching, such that the last 20 minutes is like watching a dubbed Kung-Fu movie.  I suppose I am surprised, since matching the soundtrack and visual seems like a BASIC necessity, but this sloppy redering is a mis-match. Let us hope one day someone will give this movie the right treatment (Criterion?).
B00004Y6TQ|3.0|totally frustrated, after listening to sample of all the albums and the wonderful Charlie Rose session with Bjork, I couldn't wait to &quot;buy&quot; an album. I want a certain experience of listening to her as being typical of her enormous talent. Like a signature, as when you listen to Dave Brubecks &quot;Take The A Train&quot;...it kind of says it all about Brubecks music that he wants to share with his audience , and you know you want to buy the album. Her talent and voice are incredibly interesting...would like to see her sometime in a live performance!
0930289528|5.0|Collected from the cult early eighties British comic, 'Warrior', Moore and Lloyd's chilling V for Vendetta portrays a chilling alternate Britain which has succumbed to fascism after a nuclear altercation has destroyed most of the world. In a bleak and violent society, only the strangely Jacobean vigilante 'V' seems to act as a force for good.<br />As with Orwell's 1984, Moore and Lloyd's 1982 vision of Britain in '1997' is no less potent now that the year itself has been and gone. Darkly brilliant stuff. Lloyd's art has never been better and after this, The Watchmen and 2000AD's greatest ever story, The Ballad of Halo Jones, can there be any doubt that Alan Moore is the greatest writer in British comics today?
B00003CXB6|4.0|This film is better than the original and everyone who says otherwise doesn't know a good movie if it smacked them in the face. The first had better acting. Kelly ruined the movie. But what people have to understand is that a movie like The Lost World is not about acting. It is about dinosaurs. The Lost World has twice as many dinosaur shots. It was slightly more realistic than the first. Way more people got eaten. The more people get eaten the better. More people got eaten there for it is a better movie. Simple as that. This film is far more scientificly accurate than the first. The biggest problem with the first Jurassic Park is that t-rex can't see you if you don't move crap. Who ever came up with that idea dosen't know anything. The Lost World fixed this huge problem. The first film made the raptors to smart. Like a dinosaur has the intelegence to open doors. In the Lost World they jumped through the glass which makes more sense. Still the lost world should have given the raptors feathers. The Lost World also was the first movie to have the dinosaurs take care of there babies. The San Diego scene was very cool but I think it is silly they let the t-rex live after all the people he killed. With all the films flaws it still is much better than the first. Plus we get a High Definition master transfer with anamorphic widscreen and great sound plus lots of supplements. This movie has survived as one of my favorites.
B00003CXP1|2.0|Unfortunately, I think this film fails to successfully meld style with substance. I recently watched Godard&#8217;s Band of Outsiders in its current theatrical re-release, and when I finished that refreshing experience, I realized what it was that irked me so much about Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s Requiem. Godard&#8217;s film is specifically about an addiction to media causing a disassociation with reality. Requiem for a Dream is about drugs fueling that addiction to a vision of the &#8220;better life&#8221; that the media uses to tantalize us. Both films are stylistically bold, but since Godard&#8217;s is foremost about an addiction specifically to media (i.e. the characters believe real life should live up to the standard of films), and he&#8217;s able to imbue his characters with a youthful gusto, his stylistic choices seem integrated into his narrative. <br />Aronofsky&#8217;s excess of style seems intrusive by comparison. He never really is able to make us examine these characters as real people (e.g. he has Ellen Burstyn DEVOUR the scenery). They remain stereotypes (i.e. specters that don&#8217;t really exist EXCEPT in the media), and therefore feel that they contribute to the problem of false media expectations more than they help expose it.  They are very fictional characters complaining that their lives aren&#8217;t fictional enough.<br />The drug sequences seem to be just more of the media telling us how life is. We&#8217;re supposed to get the impression that, due to Aronofsky&#8217;s technical brilliance, we&#8217;ve seen how it is to be addicted to drugs after this film, but that dishonesty bothers me here&#8230; We&#8217;ve simply watched a murky, dreadful movie.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I think it is really a great album from savagegarden<BR> these guys are really great. Their lyrics are very inspiring<BR>and beautiful.I think that the best track on the album is <BR>&quot;LOVER AFTER ME&quot; followed by &quot;HOLD ME&quot; and &quot;AFFIRMATION&quot;.<BR>And the remaining tracks are also very good.<BR>I think every music lover should by &quot;AFFIRMATION&quot;<br />              &quot;ENJOY GREAT MUSIC&quot;
B00004TFK3|1.0|Perhaps more than any other film of '97, Men in Black insulted my intelligence. I think the film thought it was terribly clever, and that's what really bothered me about it. The plot is a simple A to B progression with no twists whatsoever. Every scene exists simply to set up one lame gag, however, the problem is that the gags (which are simply a goofy CGI shot followed by a Will Smith witticism(tm) or Vincent D'Ornfrio as a redneck Beetlejuice) are just NOT funny... at all... Speilberg produced this movie, which is odd, since the thing it most lacks is what he provides best : a sense of wonder.<br />The DVD has some great special features, but what's the point if the film included is nearly unwatchable in its garish loudness?
B00005NW02|5.0|The guys from SOAD out did themselves with this sophmore album. From the opening track Prison Song you are drawn into the ferocious mayhem and at the same time subtle beauty that only SOAD could create. This album blew me away, there is not a bad song on here and Serj's vocal range goes from soft melody to out right demonic growls. Serj shouts and screams his lyrics over soem truly awesome guitar work by Daron. This album is harder, heavier, more left-of-center politically then their first album. Rage Against the Machine dropped the ball musically speaking and SOAD has picked it up and they have ran with it. I urge all metal fans and RATM fans to go pick this masterpiece up because I know you'll be as blown away as I was.
B00005OWEG|4.0|I watched the new cut of Coppola's film today (after re-watching the original release a few weeks ago), and I think the new edit is slightly misguided. In the original cut of Apocalypse Now, we're placed in the shoes of the Willard character (who functions as an everyman) as he makes his journey up the river. The scenes that are added seem to have been intended to flesh out his &amp; his boat mates characters, but I don't think that's the direction that the film should be taken in. <BR> <BR>In order for Willard to function as our stand-in, his character cannot be too defined. By showing him fraternizing with the crew members or scoring with a chick, they're changing his role. In the original cut, he really only acts a few times in the film before killing Kurtz (most notably when he shoots the woman with the puppy). Here we see him as a much more active character. He's not simply an observer of the war's insanity... He seems an active participant. To me, this takes away from my ability to feel that *I* have gone on the film's journey, and that *I* have seen the horror that man is capable of. <BR> <BR>His crew members seemed almost iconic in their vagueness, but here they are mildly developed, so they become less iconic, but are not so developed that they lose that generic feeling. What Kurtz actually says remains as irrelevant to the film's message as ever, since he's still obviously insane. While they're still well-acted parts , it's somewhat disappointing. <BR> <BR>Basically, what I'm saying is that the additional scenes do more to hurt the overall film (the French plantation sequence seems to really hurt the pacing the most) than to help it. They aren't bad scenes at all, but they simply don't have a place in the film. Apocalypse Now Redux, like most &quot;Special Editions&quot; these days, is a reduction of the original.
B0000584V3|5.0|I first heard this CD on the cable Metal channel. The music sounded a lot like bands I normally listen to, like Tool and Rage against the Machine, but somehow more complex, with some Death vocals thrown in as well. After purchasing the CD, I was even more impressed. The opening few minutes of The Drapery falls sound like nothing you'll ever hear on the radio or MTV, almost symphonic. I also bought two other Opeth CDs: Orchid and Morningrise. I would say that Morningrise is as good, and Orchid is nearly as good. Blackwater Park's songs are far more cohesive than their predecessors, and thus seem to go by quicker.
6305127646|4.0|Although both Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue have both had their share of poor films, this is not one of them.  A somewhat intelligent plot and some above average acting make this one of those rare films that's actually worth watching.  The plot is too easy to give away, and I don't want to be one of those people who wrecks the ending, so I'll just say one more thing.  Give it a try, you probably won't be disappointed.
B000002UQJ|4.0|Off The Ground was the first studio project of Paul's following his extensive 89-90 world tour. Luckily, he still had some leftover songs he cowrote with Elvis Costello to place on this album. The collaborations are the strongest songs in this collection, using almost all of the musicians on the previous album. This is definitely Paul's preachiest album, bringing up topics such as his disdain for testing on laboratory animals, and concerns for the ecology. Hardcore fans didn't appreciate those songs at all, and neither did the radio. &quot;Hope of Deliverance&quot; was the only one of many singles released off the album that received a lot of airplay. If you are lucky enough to find one, look for Off the Ground- The Complete Works (2 CDs), which is the UK version of this album. It contains all of the b-sides to the singles--material that should have been used in place of weaker songs such as &quot;Golden Earth Girl.&quot; Other fine moments showing Paul at 50 can still rock are songs such as &quot;Get Out of My Way&quot; and &quot;Off the Ground,&quot; a very underrated song. If you liked Press to Play and Flowers in the Dirt, get this album-- you will not be disappointed.

B000002UDD|3.0|After Peace Sells the music scene expected more from the band but they lost focus, the production went really bad, the band went to dope land and the band was striped to half in the beggining of the recordings all of this are reasons why Megadeths third album is not a development of their music but a small setback.<BR>Aside from that this album has great songs such Hook in Mouth and In My Darkest Hour and my personal fav Into The Lungs of Hell
B00004RGUU|5.0|Sometime when you get tired of the trite fare which Hollywood seems to dish up now, pull out this old favorite and treat yourself to a great evening.  Robert Redford and Paul Newman have the perfect chemistry and on-screen repartee which keeps this movie rolling, from beginning to end.  They may be the bad guys, but they are so loveable that you can't help but root for them.  There is not much of a plot here, simply a movie-long chase of the good guys chasing the bad guys, but it's done in such a charming and compelling way that you'll be glad that you joined the chase.
B00005K3O4|5.0|It's unimaginable what the Chiodo Brothers have done with such a miniscule budget.This film is a prime example of how boundless imagination,inspiration,and an genuine love for cheap horror movies can overcome limited resources.It will no doubt be appreciated by aspiring directors.The sound on the DVD is only 2 channel(a 5.1 mix would have been great),but it is still excellent.The image quality is top notch,it's as good as it's ever going to look,and it's widescreen.There are some artifacts and scratches present,but overall fantastic.You can finally fully appreciate what a monumental achievement this is.There are loads of extras.A commentary by the Chiodo Brothers that's not only informative,but very funny as well.You can see these guys have a warped sense of humor,even more so when you hear them explain how the film was made.There's also 2 deleted scenes,a making of featurette,theatrical trailer,and storyboards(my least favorite,even though i realize they are very important).There is also a highly entertaining home movie the brothers made when they were in there teens.There enormous talent and skill is on display in this early effort.Fans of the film won't need my reccomendation,but people who haven't seen Killer Klowns and are interested in inventive,entertaining,original comedy/hooror movies are encouraged to buy this film now.How can you go wrong with popcorn guns,homicidal klowns,cotton candy cocoons,and brilliant set pieces.The dialogue is side splitting too,especially the guy who plays a cop who despises young people,he practically steals the show.This film is an inspiration,and it might have more meaning for me because the Chiodos grew up in Deer Park,NY,about 30 minutes from where i did in Levittown.Thank You from an aspiring filmmaker.
B00005B7CK|4.0|George Clooney and his cohorts escape from a chain gang and are in search of a fortune he buried after he robbed a bank.  Along the way, they encounter some unlikely characters and situations.  Just as you think you're getting a handle on what this movie is all about, it throws you a curve and you find yourself asking &quot;Now, where did THAT come from?&quot;  Nevertheless, George Clooney scores well as an ex-con with a great vocabulary and an obsession with keeping his hair looking its best.  There's lots of great music in the background and as part of the story.  Let me warn you that guys will probably like this better than women.
0553106635|5.0|it started out kind of slow, but after the first 500 pages it went quick. storm of swords is so shocking a leaves so much unsaid, i can't wait for the next book. anyone who likes fantasy or even history should read this book, it shames the other &quot;best&quot; fantasy authors, even jordan and goodkind.
B000021YQV|5.0|Well it was a long wait but it finally arrived, and the new System album fails to dissapoint. The production has improved, and more instruments and dynamics introduced since the first album and the change is for the better. It doesnt sound as raw and gritty as the first album, but Toxicity is laced with more melodies and even the odd harmony which all add to its beauty. Im still in shock and after listening to it about 30 times, it still sounds as good as anyhting else around. Astounding.
020530902X|5.0|As an author with my debut novel in its initial release and an instructor who teaches at both the college and secondary levels, I can safely say that THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE is simply the finest how-to book for writing.  Anyone who wants to know how to write, or write better, professionally or otherwise, needs to have a copy of this book.  All is explained.  All is made clear.  I, for one, would rather leave home without my American Express Card than without this book.
0446310786|5.0|A jewel of a book-- I really learned more about humanity and the innocence of a child from this book than from most of my life put together.  Atticus is the ideal, gentle, wise, thoughtful and calmly rooted father who teaches curious children Scout and Jem about life.  Boo Radley, the deceivingly &quot;bad guy&quot; in this book in fact turns out to be the kids' best friend.  Everything about this book makes me feel good to read... and I haven't even mentioned the trial.

B00003CXRP|1.0|After 30 minutes into the movie I was hoping Tom Hanks would starve or suffer from eating something poisonous. This movie didn't engage me at all. I had no respect for the main character. I did not feel connected at all. The tv-show Survivor had more drama in it !!<br />Now for something that really bothered me : why the hell did he hold on to the last box for so long !! They could have saved the movie by having him open the box after coming back to the civilised world and having it contain a letter-bomb !!!<br />Tom Hanks should be ashamed of himself. He played this role like he played most others. Just by loosing 30 pounds, doesn't make you a good actor, Mr. Hanks.<br />If you want to see a good, spiritual Zemeckis film try Forrest Gump or Contact.
0385495323|5.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for.  It's equal parts history, mystery and science.  I read it in about two days, which is quite a rarity for me.  On only two occasions did I need to reread a passage to understand the mathematics involved, which was quite an accomplishment for the author.  <br />I'm off to the bookstore to buy Singh's other book at lunch today, and if it's half as good as The Code Book I'll have it done by the end of the weekend.<br />Buy the book.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I wasn't a big fan of Silence of the Lambs and absolutely HATED Manhunter by Michael Mann, which actually is the most overrated film with the most mediocre acting I have ever seen.<br />After all the bad press, I was quite anxious to see Hannibal and find out if it really was that bad. Well the answer is Yes and No !<br />Yes. This movie was bad. The original Hannibal Lecter was a psychopath, a dangerous man. In this movie they have made him into some sort of martyr fighting the rude and uncivilised people of the world. What is up with that ? Hannibal doesn't need glorifying. People like him because he is smart and scary, not because he is a good person. Also there is a lack of synchronisity in this movie. One minute we are in Rome, the next minute in Washington D.C. Like anybody could find anyone that fast !!<br />No. This movie wasn't that bad. If you look at it as a single piece of work, you will find that the acting is quite good, especially by Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore. The make-up effects are incredible. I also liked the portrayal of Agent Starling, which seemed pretty well-done. <br />Overal a pretty amusing film, but not for the fans.

6304510861|5.0|I think the people who are desperately trying to make sense of this movie (this character is the alter ego of that character, it is about such-and-so) do not really understand this movie.<br />I have seen an interview with David Lynch somewhere in which he was talking about creating movies in which the story is not that important. I think he was talking about this one.<br />There is no real story. There is not truth. It is about angst and confusion. It is about lust. The images are used to convey the FEELING that the movie is about. Do not try to overanalyze this movie. Just experience it for the masterpiece that it truly is.
B000059H99|5.0|One of the greater films ever done.Period.It's a touching and highly emotional little movie about determination, courage and the power of love.It gives important messages and lessons in every scene, and it also made every guy believe in their dreams and wishes.Rocky deservedly won an Oscar for Best Picture and despite what film snobs tend to say, it must be one of the most special movies ever brought to screen.It's impossible not to cry with the story of a simple minded boxer who gives his best to go the distance with the champion and finnally prove something to himself: that he isn't just another bum fro the neighboor.Buy this great DVD now!
B000002UW1|5.0|REM's best work can be found in their intial offerings...with their first albums they crafted a new kind of music for the world. Yet, I consider &quot;Document&quot; to be my personal favorite.  Why? Because it is one of the albums I think of when I think of my past. Along with a handfull of other albums, I happened to discover it during the &quot;formative teen&quot; period of life that we all go through and tend to recall when we feel nostalgic...so it has been forever sewn into my bone and sinew.<br />&quot;Document&quot; represents a turning point in REM's career. Most everything prior is inspired genius, most everything after is lacking of the true &quot;REM&quot; sound and soul.  If you think of &quot;Reveal&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; when you think of REM, do yourself a favor and start over at the beginning of their career. Although I can appreciate the effort of their newer work, it just doesn't match their initial offerings.
B00005NGZX|5.0|jesus christ. i dont even know what to say...any converge fan knew that this album would rock. they spent so long working on it, and the end result definitely lives up to all the hype. A major thing that stands out is the production on this album is crisp. This is new for converge. all their other albums were horribly produced. the artwork is awesome, too. Jake Bannon is the man. All Converge fans already know that, though.
B0000033TE|5.0|The trio had already proved that yes, a rock band, let alone a trio, could create great orchestral-type music while still managing to rock hard.  They certainly made it into scientific law on this one.<br />The masterpiece starts with &quot;Jerusalem,&quot; a variation on a hymn.  Apparently, they went under minor fire for doing it.  It's not my favorite, and i don't listen to it a lot, but still, nice conversion.<br />&quot;Toccata,&quot; is 2nd to Karn Evil in terms of greatness, but an excellent take one of Alberto Ginastera's piano concertos, the 4th movement.  It seems the publisher wouldn't allow Emerson to cover it, so he paid a visit to the man himself, armed with a tape player and a demo.  Ginastera gave it a listen and declared it &quot;Diabolic!&quot;  For a moment, Emerson thought his idea was foiled, but instead, Ginastera claimed that it was the best interpretation of any of his works and gladly gave Keith the permission to record it.  Smart guy.  Some of the 1st part might sound similar to the flying monkey sequence in The Wizard of Oz.<BR>Carl Palmer did not use actual drums, believe it or not.  He used a synthesizer for the tympani sounds and the spacy solo that sounds like Keith's Moog.<br />Despite many people's thoughts, I believe that &quot;Still... You turn me on&quot; is the worst song.  A Greg Lake ballad, the man did not realize that Emerson and Palmer (the two big jazz forces) were focused on good works and not on attracting girls to the albums.  That's what his section of Works I was for.<br />A lot of people think that Benny the Bouncer is the worst song, but really it's the 2nd worst, IMO.  It's a pretty funny song to hear, and pretty creative, following the saloon player piano style of Jeremy Bender on Tarkus and The Sheriff on Trilogy.  The weakness, Pete Sinfield.  He wrote the lyrics for this and KE9 3rd Impr.<br />Now the mag opus.  Karn Evil 9, a 30-minute piece that never leaves you bored.  The 1st impression, part 1 is the best part of the whole thing, due to its less commercial approach, unlike part 2.  What a lot of people don't know is that good old Emo sings the whole 1st Impression.  That's understandable, considering he sounds a lot like the aggressive side of Lake.<BR>Part 2 is good, but the whole 'show' thing is more repetitive.<br />2nd Impression is a more jazzier piece, with Emerson on piano and minimoog with arpeggiated steel drum patch, to give it a Carribean rhythm to it.  It eventually leads to this quiet piano bit that sounds like an interpretation of a midnight murder mystery, but enough about that.  It finally ends in an uptempo beat and goes into 3rd impression.<br />Now this is where it mostly goes wrong in terms of lyrics.  In fact, the lyric &quot;No man yields who flies in my ship&quot; is thought as &quot;No man yields to flies in my...&quot; whatever...<br />The brass stabs coming from this was from 1 of the 2 Moog prototypes that Keith used, but were never released.  They were 2 of three parts of the Constellation system, the Lyra solo synth, which was a minimoog on steroids, the Apollo polyphonic synth (which evolved into the abysmal Polymoog), and the Taurus bass pedals, which had been a product for 2 years then, but Emerson did not use.<br />It's not a bad sequence and I don't know why people hate it so.  <br />If &quot;You turn me on&quot; were excluded, this would have been perfect, but hey guys, great effort!
B0000009S3|5.0|This album is simply one of the best recordings ever made, period. Not going to get into the whole Zappa thing and compare different albums he has done, but let's just say that all the mother's releases befor HOT RATS were just a warm up. This is one whole different level. Pure music executed with perfection in every way, there are no flaws to be heard. Five stars just ain't enough. Musicianship...5 stars.  Composition...5 stars. Coheisiveness... 5 stars. Production...5 stars.  Instrumentation...5 stars. Originality (1969)...5 stars. Groove...5 stars. Solos... 5 stars. Ability to be played over and over and over and over without getting tired of it...5 stars.  Ability to be listened to under almost any circumstance (in the car, shower, having sex, cleaning up, meditating, relaxing, building clay figurines, as a backdrop to a cheesy sci-fi flick, etc.)...5 stars. Ability to astound the listener with how one individual could compose and produce such detailed material by himself at the age of 28... 5 stars.  I could go on, but there just aren't enough stars. Timeless. Frank really outdid himself on this one, hell, he really outdid just about ever other composer, guitarist, and producer in existance, past , present, and most probably future.

B000002LIM|5.0|I saw the movie Batman when I was only 9 years old, and I instantly fell in love with it as well as the music. I brought the cassette with songs from Prince and co. and found it OK. But for years I was trying to find the score on cassette but couldn't find it. Then, about 5 years ago, I found it on CD. This was the first movie score I ever brought, and it was fantastic. Elfman is known for his &quot;dark&quot; music and it's just right for the Dark Knight in this classic movie by Tim Burton. Although I love the whole album, track 10 &quot;Descent into Mystery&quot; is my all time fave, with the choir singing in the background, you feel the brooding darkness that Batman inspires. I have over 10 movie scores on CD, but &quot;Batman&quot; is the one I listen to almost all the time. For anyone who has never brought a movie score before, I highly recommend this one by Elfman, even if you didn't see the movie, get the score. And for those who love classical music, the Batman and Edward Scissorhands original soundtrack score was played on WQXR: the classical music station of the New York Times!!!!
B00000K3CR|4.0|Tom Hanks is terrific in this film.  He plays Josh Baskin, a twelve-year-old boy who has been transformed physically into an adult.  He projects the awkwardness and innocence of youth well and is supported by a good screenplay that makes the most of this fantastic situation.  Screenwriters Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg had the inspiration to place this naive, goodhearted character among the competitive, cut-throat yuppies on the staff of a major toy company.  Josh's insights into what appeals to kids (after all, he really is one) allows him to advance rapidly, much to the dismay of his coworkers, who see in his every action the same kind of manipulation and scheming that enabled them to reach their positions.  The juxtaposition makes Josh seem like the real grown-up and provides an interesting opportunity to appreciate how important it is to hang on to some of our more child-like qualities as we grow older./

0446677450|1.0|Ok, Kiyosaki has a point but it doesn't take a book to make his point clear. Basically he says, buy assets and don't buy liabilities. and don't spend money on unnecessary luxuries before your cash flow can cover for these luxuries. how do you create these excess cash flows? by real estate and stocks and mutual funds. for an average middle class 9 to 5 worker, he basically says, stay in your job and buy real estate on the side and he adds, don't forget to look for IPO opportunities because that's where he made money along with his real estate business. <BR> <BR>This is the whole argument kiyosaki presents but he spends a whole book repeating this point over and over and over again.<br />Book is terribly written -- many spelling errors (which are really annoying to me) and grammar mistakes. and the kiyosaki's insights are pretty lame and dull and pretty obvious.<br />don't waste time reading this book and look for better, insightful books -- i am sure there are many!
B000002C25|1.0|...no matter who would've recorded it. the fact that its oasis makes it worse. however heinous &amp; arrogant noel gallagher and the other apes were about how they saved rock and roll etc., the thing that saved them from being nothing but self inflated clods is that noel's songs generally lived up to the hype. not here, laddie. this is a collection of weak material, lyrically &amp; musically. noel tries to cover up that fact with dense overdubbing &amp; general noodling, which makes it sound like pointless soloing in search of a song. the ballads are obvious, sappy, and poorly written (ex: dont go away has perhaps one of the dumbest choruses i've ever heard-&quot;dont go away/say what you'll say/say that you'll stay/forever and a day&quot;-was this written in kindergarten?) with this album, noel bought into the hype the fawning critics threw his way-that he was a genius. he continued the path he started with the wildly overrated but good morning glory toward becoming an &quot;artist&quot;, when all oasis is, was, and ever could be is a ROCK AND ROLL BAND!!...delusions of grandeur do not necessarily make &quot;art&quot;. the strengths of definitely maybe, one of the best rock records ever made, are completely gone by this, only their third release! even liams vocals, the most important element of the groups sound, are dulled down. oasis stumbled very badly, &amp; have yet to recover.
0790729652|5.0|The movie Batman brings the legendary comic book to life.  Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances as the Joker and Keaton is perfect for the part of the caped crusader.  He plays the complicated Bruce Wayne to a tee.  Val Kilmer and George Clooney in the sequels were no match for Keaton.  The plot is very clever and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The special effects are superb.  The only flaw in this movie was that Tim Burton did not give a cameo to the original Batman, Adam West, which would have been appropriate.  If you are a fan of the comic book, you will definately enjoy the movie.  If you are not a comic fan, you will still enjoy the movie if you like action or adventure movies.
B00005N5S5|5.0|James Camerons trend-setting action masterpiece is finally getting the treatment it deserves.  I haven't viewed the dvd yet, but it has to be better than that horrible dvd peddled off a few years ago.  What else can I say, Arnold is truly terrifying from beginning to end.  The scene in which he tears the punk's heart out still scares the hell out of me everytime.  It is just so disheartening to see no expression as he mows down old women and then proceeds to unload his gun into them.  Cameron shows his extraordinary talent for action-suspense pictures in this film, it is engrossing its entire running length, never once letting up.  It is a truly satisfying action thrill ride.  If you haven't seen this, you need to.  And if you already have, you are probably going to buy this.  So I will say no more.
B00005JG6Q|1.0|I remember the original VHS copy released years ago in english dubbs. I seem to recall a better characterization within the actors themselves who played each character. The only flaw was the sound fx. Now pioneer animation has effectively ruined the entire akira experience for me and I am reduced to my old VHS copy which probably can't be purchased anymore. Clearly it was better. The voices sound like adults trying to sound like children doing some bad impressions of characters. The original english dubbed version was far more brutal and cutting edge. This new dialogue is for children. I am sorry to say I have returned my DVD version.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|While I may find the movie has some flaws, there isn't a damn thing wrong with this soundtrack, although the length is my lone gripe, I wanted more. As in true Bjork fashion, all semblance of her previous recordings goes straight out the window when you first listen to this. This review is little late, I have had this since last September, but am just getting to write the review, so I am not including Vespertine in my review. It starts with a fully instrumental &quot;Overture.&quot; Then continues to use machinery as a rhythmic tool, &quot;Cvalda.&quot; Next, a duet with the bored sounding Thom Yorke in &quot;I've Seen it All&quot;, bored doesn't mean bad by the way. &quot;In the Musicals&quot; is next, it reminds me of a Broadway style climax, it uses a bouncing ball as a beat, quite cool. &quot;Scatterheart&quot; a devastatingly beautiful song, and what I believe to be the strongest song on the album, it has a beautiful melody at the beginning that soon combines with a fiercely electronic element, fusing into an elaborate, beautiful whole. &quot;107 Steps&quot; is the next song, I think it is the weakest song on the album, it is average for Bjork standards, I wont say anymore. Last, &quot;New World&quot; this song only truly becomes powerful after viewing the movie, it really does depress me everytime I hear it, great song. I didn't mention Bjork's voice, just because it's always great, and there is no real need to mention the one element that is a constant. Anyway, buy it, savior it, but don't listen before you watch the movie, it just doesn't have quite the same potency.

B00000I952|5.0|No pop act today can compare to the catchiness and melody of Abba.  And their artistic sincerity really shined through on THE VISITORS, the final album in late 1981.<br />What makes this such a superb cut?  Begin with the overall sound.  Abba were charging forward from the oldies sound of 70s pop into the characteristic sounds of the 1980s--synthpop, new wave, dance-club music.  Had they remained for another album, who knows what?  They would probably still be heard today on AC radio, a genre that still plays 80s music liberally.  This is one of the earliest albums to make complete use of CLEAN SOUNDING electronic drum tracks and synthetically manipulated voices (listen to songs like WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE and TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE to hear this mastery).  The sound on this album approaches the likes of Duran Duran or early Madonna (especially on the title track).  It's actually cool and fun to dance to.<br />Second, the emotions are wonderfully set here which range from haunting Halloween-esque fear ('The Visitors') to Swedish folk music ('Head Over Heels') to divorce sorrow ('When All Is Said and Done' and 'One Of Us') to parenthood ('Slipping Through My Fingers') to memories of the past ('Like An Angel Passing Through My Room').  This last song sounds especially like a good-bye song with its quietude and midnight-hour atmosphere.  It's Abba's denouement after nearly ten years of fame and glory.<br />Finally, these singers have perfect voices on this album and the recording is wonderful.  No more tinny studios that sound like the Sixties.  Everything here is pretty much just as crisp in audio as today's pop music records.  Many songs recorded for a few years after in America didn't have this same clarity. <br />While The Beatles can be accepted by most as the most overall innovative artists in the history of the music industry, when it comes to pure melody and family-friendly pop, Abba can't be beat.  No group before or since has made me so likely to shed tears in joy or sorrow. <br />I would definitely recommend THE VISITORS, the final dying gasp by one of the greatest pop groups of all time-ABBA!
0786915749|5.0|I have to admit I was a little reluctant to read this book.<BR>I've had a little prejudice toward books based on gaming but now after reading this masterpiece, I'm hooked on dragonlance!Weis and Hickman have successfully transported me to the world of Krynn.When I first started the book, I thought this would be quick undemanding tolkenish fantasy read with your humans,dwarves and elves battling against evil.I was wrong!

0790725657|3.0|This was one of my favourite books when I was a little girl. The movie is well done, but I was disappointed at the &quot;Hollywood ending&quot; that replaced the original ending of the book; it's unnecessary and it doesn't ring true.  In the book, although Sara is adopted by the wealthy man next door, who turns out to be her father's business partner and who restores her fortune, her father doesn't return. She becomes comfortable and secure again, and her efforts to be good and brave during hard times have made her a better person, but things will never be as they were before. To pretty this up with a dramatic last-minute reappearance, as was done in this film, is an injustice both to the book and to the audience; the best children's books don't avoid the question of irretrievable loss, but face it squarely and so help young readers to learn that although great losses will occur, we can survive them.  Sara's father doesn't return; Beth March dies; Sykes kills Nancy; these leave us saddened but not destroyed. Too bad that this film ditched this sombre but true ending for an over-dramatised, all-but-incredible, sugar-plum ending; it's a good film, but it could have been a great one.

B000059T5O|5.0|This CD burns so hot you best watch out.<br />Stop reading, go buy this CD, clear your schedule for the rest of the day, make sure you have plenty of whiskey, and put Wicked Grin in the CD player. When you awake hungover, put this CD back on, smoke a cigarette (even if you don't normally smoke), and ponder how miserable you are with your down and out life (even if you have all the reason to be happy). This is the real deal.
B00002DE2L|5.0|This isn't your usual Sunday brunch rendering of The Four Seasons. Anne-Sophie Mutter brings the Vivaldi favorite to vivid life with both sensitivity and boldness, and she's helped along by the full-orchestra-sounding Trondheim Soloists from Norway, whom she also directs. Ms. Mutter's usual clear and silvery tone shines beautifully, and the smaller orchestra reveals finer shadings in the music, with the harpsichord now audible in its lovely crispness. Nothing dull or boring in this version, which I find to be my favorite of The Four Seasons. The second work, Tartini's virtuosic \\"Devil's Trill\\" gets a similarly expansive treatment, with Ms. Mutter's fantastic fiddling in abundant evidence, and I loved it, too. So go get this CD, listen and feel the thrill!
0671024256|5.0|The master is a master of more than just sensational horror.  Anyone who has read the majority of King's work, knows he is far more than &quot;the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries&quot; (as he's called himself).  This book is the money for anyone who hasn't taken a writing course, but is interested in the art of writing fiction that people will want to read.  The first half of the book is dedicated to the craft, while the last section is a reminscing of King's horrible accident.  I cried the first time I read about the accident.  The pain that man went through bleeds through the page.  This one is definitely a must read.
6305342776|5.0|I don't know why I like this movie so much, maybe because of the Cygnus which looks like a haunted house in space, the overall dark feel of the movie, the creepy thought provoking ending...and most important, the mood setting soundtrack. COMPLETELY AWESOME!!! But why hasn't ever been released? It's absolutley one of the best I have ever heard. Tell me you don't feel anything when Capt Holland is walking thru the empty crew quarters and your probably dead. The awesome &quot;we're cut off&quot; theme with its heavy electronic bass beat and more. One of Barry's best to be sure. Please! Somebody release this soundtrack!
B000001E7T|5.0|I have all her releases and this one is a standout.  I can't say that it's the best but that is why I appreciate her music so much....every one is different in its own way.  Her variety, through subtle tones, harsh attacks, and unbelieveably complicated background rythums, makes her such an untiring joy to listen to.<BR>Basically, if you can't appreciate what is going on with her music and the originality that goes into every song, you don't deserve to listen to it.  <BR>She is the best talent to come around in a long, long time.
B000002LK1|5.0|In a word - Excellent! Every track is outstanding. If you're not already a DM fan, this album will convince you.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I watch very few of current day movies but my daughter brought the DVD on a visit. Seeing the movie brought back rememberances from the past. In 1940 at the age of 5, I saw Governor W. Lee (Pappy) O'Daniel at a street rally in Farmersville, TX. It is one of my earliest memories and obviously was impressive. It was just as depicted in the movie although I'm not sure the Texas Pappy O'Daniel was such a fool as Charles Durning's character. He, according to my older relatives, was a paragon in radio broadcasting during the '30's and probably had the force in Texas that Walter Cronkite did later nationally on TV. He was elected to head the state of Texas without any political experience. You Are My Sunshine also brought back memories of Jimmie Davis of Louisiana; living in East Texas,we heard his campaign broadcasts from the Shreveport radio station. The Down to the River to Pray segment brought back memories of my own baptism in a similar situation and the a capella singing of the choir was nothing short of beautiful.<BR>I thought the acting was a bit over the top but provided the proper setting and emphasis to a very enjoyable movie. I have replayed the movie several times and enjoyed it even more each time. It is a movie well worth keeping and watching again from time to time.
B00004WGAA|5.0|I bought this dvd to get an affordable copy of Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS. I can't currently justify the high price of the Criterion version, so this one serves nicely. Harvey's film is a true masterpiece. He coaxes excellent perfomances from every actor involved in this movie, but the real star here is the director. What a shame; what a tragedy that this man did not receive the attention and praise he so richly deserved for this amazing and disturbing film. From the opening credits, one is keenly aware that this movie is a work of art, from the patterns Harvey discovered and lovingly framed in the moving water and sediments of a muddy riverbank, to the ingeniously placed titles as the film begins. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I never tire of seeing a true innovator at work. And no matter how many times I see it, I feel sorry that Harvey didn't produce any follow-up features, but happy that he left us this treasure.
B00003W8NO|5.0|Toy Story should have been rated PG for humor. And some screnes there is humor. But I can't believe Tom Hanks in a short movie than his longer movies when he is front of the crama.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is a perfect thriller it has the twist and turns that are necessary to carry the viewer through the whole flick. But what elevates this film above every other thriller of the past ten or so years is that if you blink, laugh or linger too much on a pivotal scene the whole flick becomes a mosh pit of violence, tragedy and brilliant acting that still ties together at the end but not as tight a knot as it would be as if the viewer would have paid attention. So long story short you will have to watch this dvd at least 3 or 4 times just for a complete picture. The story paints the amazing Guy Pearce as Leonard a modern day Trojan Horse who is used by all the bad guys around him to do their own dirty dealings but Leonard has problems of his own he has a dead wife and short term memory loss. Leonard body is covered in tattoos and pockets full of poloraids of the people he interacts with so he could have some form of continuinity in his life. I won't play spoiler here but the plot is simple but the pace is not. You have to catch the opening to get the endng and the flashbacks don't really excell the story instead they are in place to make the viewer draw their own conclusion as to Leonard's life. Because for all the Trojan Horsing he has been doing some key factor remains Leonard's wife is dead, nobody including Leonard can be trusted, the hand is not quicker than the eye and Memento has to be on eof the most daunting and rewarding films in the history of cinema!

B00005AXEL|5.0|First it is important to take into consideration that the music of Stevie Nicks (her unique raspy voice and mystical, sometimes spacey lyrics) is an acquired taste, period. Some listeners will never be able to enjoy or appreciate her as an artist because none of her work (from &quot;Rhiannon&quot; to &quot;Trouble In Shangri-la) will appeal to them, and that's just fine. With regard to the new album, I think it contains some her best work ever whether it be compared with her solo work or her work with Fleetwood Mac. The arrangements are fresh and exciting and the production of the album is very well-crafted, courtesy of collaborator/producer Sheryl Crow. While some of the songs contain stronger songwriting than others, there are no weak tracks in this set from start to finish. Her collaborations with different artists on the album were well-chosen and each artist complements Stevie very well. (Stevie has always had the distinct ability to harmonize with other vocalists well.) While she has surely lost some of her range as far as pitch goes, she has only strengthened her intensity and conviction that she brings to the lyrics of her songs. Congratulations on the new album, Stevie, and thanks for all the music.
B00003CXTG|3.0|If you liked Titanic you'll probably enjoy this film... there's lots of action and some cheesey romance... It's entertaining but was definitely too long for the kind of movie it was... I was glad I saw it but I dont think I'd buy it.
0792839749|3.0|I rented this the other day because my wife had never seen it.  I found it just as enjoyable as ever.  Dick van Dyke proves that Jim Carrey did not invent the art of physical comedy (I'll tip my hat to Danny Kaye as well).  Forgettable score?...  Let's compare this with the drivel cranked out today; all the pop, R&B infested soundtracks designed to sell CD's rather than enhance the story.  Most of the numbers, in fact, are quality works.  Granted, the title song does have a kind of a persistent monotony, rivaled only by \\"It's a Small World\\"... but one should, perhaps, forgive this in light of the haunting minor-moded lullaby \\"Hushabye Mountain\\", the rousing \\"Me 'Ol Bamboo\\" (what a feast of choreography!) and the captivating \\"Doll on a Music Box/Truley Scrumptious\\" duet, which I believe is one of the great moments of music theater on film (I only wish that van Dyke had been permitted to fully complete the counterpoint to Howes' charming melody.)<br />Too long?... maybe it seems that way because Disney has spent a good part of the century teaching us that good children's movies end after 75 minutes.  Anyone who thinks a kid's attention span isn't longer than that hasn't watched one glued to a Playstation console for half a day (or more.)<br />I will heartily join the masses of supporters who criticize the DVD for it's pan-scan format.  *Ahem*  I WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS MOVIE ON DVD UNTIL A BETTER EDITION IS PRODUCED.  I would most surely give such a product the full five stars that this movie deserves.
1573300403|3.0|I was thinking perhaps it's just my DVD, but it appears others are having an issue with the DVD sound quality. I like the videos on DVD format because that way you can skip over to the next if you don't like the one you're watching. I happen to skip over Beat It and Thriller. I'm not and never was one to like either of those songs or videos. I would say the same for Billie Jean if it was the video.<br />I also dislike the fact that it is a 2 sided disc and fail to understand why it is?<br />On the upside and why I gave it a 3 is because Michael Jackson is by far my favorite entertainer. I am an admirer of him by his works (music, videos, etc) as well as by his personal strength to continue on with life, regardless.<br />Watching Liberian Girl after all of these years, makes me wonder where, in the world, are some of these old stars? Where did they go to?<br />Unfortunately, I seem to skip over Smooth Criminal video, which is a shame because Smooth Criminal is my favorite video of all time. But due to the sound quality on the DVD...it just isn't worth listening to or watching.<br />As far as the HIStory videos themselves, fantastic for those of us that live in America. We rarely get to see They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow, and Earth Song!<br />Honestly, if you're not a Michael Jackson fan, skip the DVD and just buy the VHS if you are thinking about buying this. The dvd is nothing special and no extras, other than the lyrics...

B00005ATQ9|4.0|Stanley Kubricks's long picturesque saga of an Irish rogue in 18th Century Europe is certainly the most entertaining costume drama ever made. Each frame of the film is filled with visual splendor as meticulous as a classic painting. Panoramic battle scenes and richly detailed costume and set designs come alive as from an artist's palette. Ryan O'Neal's bogus Irish accent is easily forgiven as he seems merely a prop in the center of Kubrick's vision of European aristocracy in conflict with an Irishman's independence. The pistol dueling scenes are outstanding.
B00000IMCW|5.0|Only a hater would give this movie a 4 stars and a half.the movie is like 2 hours long. the millions and millions of  zombies layeth the smacket down  on these four sorry jabroni's trying to take over the mall? i mean come on millions of zombies. The Dawn of the Dead is even better on DVD,you know DVD got there name from RVD? huh? if you love night of the living dead you will love this movie.
B00003CXSP|5.0|One noticable thing about all the negative reviews of Hannibal is that people compare it to Silence Of The Lambs. Hannibal is a completely different film in every way! Now let me say that Silence of The Lambs is one of my favorite films of all-time. But the thing is this, Sotl is a psychlogical-thriller, Hannibal is a darkly comedic love-story. In that retrospect it is excellent. From Hans Zimmers haunting score, to John Mathisen managing to make Florence Italy look bleak and outstanding set designs, Hannibal is among the highest in it's class. The dvd also features outstanding commentary for film buffs, excellent production video's and deleted scenes that further interest in the film. Well worth your money!
B00005B36H|5.0|TOOL has yet again managed to write an album that will reshape hard music for years to come.  With their first efforts (OPIATE and UNDERTOW) TOOL created a new genre of metal music-- filled with angst, turmoil, and dark, moody, brooding feelings of destruction, death, and revenge.  Now a more mature TOOL have recorded an inspirational album with a message of life, endurance, and self-transformation.  <br />Picking up where ÆNIMA left off, LATERALUS finds the band facing the results of their collective Saturn Return, testing their wills and their patience, and finally coming to the realization that life is good.  Not an album for little boys with potty mouths and red ball caps, LATERALUS changes the listener if they but have a modicum of self respect, integrity, and a desire to evolve.
B00005NW02|5.0|Toxicity delivers all the heavy, yet melodic thrills that highlighted system's first album. smooth in-song transitions from heavy to light leave you breathless, and leave the cd with a great straight-thru listen. A unique sound overall that sets them apart from slipknot or linkin park, their armenian heritage provides a great background for a band. definitely worth a listen, dont hesitate to buy this one.
B000001EL3|3.0|I'll start by saying that this does have a couple of classic KISS songs, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; is still one of my favorites. &quot;God of Thunder&quot; is another classic. &quot;Beth&quot; while not my personal favorite, certainly had its merits, as it gained KISS legions of fans. &quot;King of the Night Time World&quot; and &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot; are also good KISS songs. But that is about where it ends. <br />First, you have to understand that Bob Ezrin was brought in to produce this album. KISS lost some of their edge working with Bob Ezrin. They made a commercially acceptable album. They used orchestra music; &quot;Beth,&quot; and a choir; &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; And to me it sounds like they are using some kind of organ in &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; (sounds like a merry go round to me.) KISS had it right when Eddie Kramer produced their albums. <br />So in the end, this album is a must have for a KISS fan, as it does have some great tunes, but for the casual listener, Alive! is a good start. Anything produced by Eddie Kramer is a good bet.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie had me up all night reconstructing events in my head.  The DVD is loaded with extras that give you insight into Leonard's motivations and should be viewed only after you have seen the movie.<br />This is the type of movie you could watch again again, getting something different out of it each time.<br />This movie completely set me on my heels, everyone you think you know, you don't, or do you?<br />Like I said, this movie makes you think and I am surprised how many people like it because most of the movies that make you think people tend to hate. They just want sex and violence, the story is unimportant.<br />This is all about the story and you can't miss a second of the film otherwise you won't be able to piece together Leonard's motivations or who the other character's are.<br />Rent it, borrow it, buy it, just see it somehow.<br />I give all kinds of respect to everyone involved in the making of this film.  It is simply outstanding.
0553277472|5.0|I've had a copy of this book for 10 years, and in that time I've read it 4 times.  Each time I reread it, I find new things which impress.  Just leaving aside the central Metaphysics-of-Quality for a moment, its actually a well written story.  The author illustrates his knowledge of language through descriptions of the origins of words, and he puts this knowledge to good use.  He seems to have put considerable effort into using the correct words throughout - only the use of 'square' grates nowadays.<br />The other (for me) great thing now is the ironic humour which is especially visible in part 3.  For example, there;s the part where the author's son is having a severe emotional crisis in a restaurant, they get up to leave, and the waitress says:<BR>&quot; I'm sorry your boy's not feeling good. &quot;  Well if you're familiar with the book, this is so full of irony it can make you laugh out loud.<br />It just leads me to think this guy is *even* cleverer each time you read it.
0688152023|4.0|The first 66 pages are pictures of dancers and information about the New York City Ballet. The pages that include the actual workout have a lot of empty space and photos that don't pertain to the specific workout.  If you are interested in ballet and dance photography, this is a nice bonus to a good workout. <BR>The workout itself is simple, but challenging.  It is helpful to have had a ballet background, so you now how to do the moves without just flopping your limbs around. If you don't know how to use resistance and move your body in slow, controlled movements, this workout will be too easy and not effective.
0553565915|1.0|I had seen an interview with Betty Eadie a few years ago, where it was revealed that she has consistantly refused to let anyone view her medical records. If she really did die, then she wouldn't have anything to hide, now would she? However, I gave her the benefit of the doubt, me being into spiritual things. So I read her book. What garbage! As a nurse, I know what happens when a person goes into cardiac arrest, as she claims happened to her. The description she gave of her resuscitation was hilarious. And then the next day the doctor asks her &quot;What happened to you last night?&quot; Is this comedy fiction or what? Later on in the book, she says she went to see the doctor and asked if she really did die that night. He looked up the record and lo and behold, Betty had died.<br />When a patient arrests or codes, as it is called in hospital talk, CPR is begun, a lot of drugs are given, and they usually end up on a ventilator in intensive care. In her case, since she was bleeding from surgery, she would have been taken back to the operating room and opened up again. When she woke up she would've been hooked up to all kinds of monitors and machines, and probably not even able to speak. It's not exactly kept a secret from the patient! People know that they arrested. Only if they were under anesthesia, or in a coma, would they not know that something terrifying was happening to them.This would all be in her medical record if it happened, which it probably didn't. No wonder she doesn't let anyone look.<br />Next, her view of the afterlife. Very Christian in nature, but if this is what happens when everyone dies, what about non-Christians? Do they get to meet Jesus and get converted? Do they get a crash course on the Christian Bible? And armies of angels going off to fight battles? Is this Star Wars, biblical style? Why on earth does God need an army? God is almighty and omnipotent and can do whatever. Angels in armor--I almost choked. And the fact that men rule heaven...hmmm. Twelve men sitting around a table. Do we have such mundane things in heaven as tables? It seems that according to Betty, we still retain our skin and genital organs when we die. I was under the impression that spirits were sexless, that being male and female was a human thing. I wonder if female angels are in charge of serving the coffee to God and washing up the dishes.<br />All in all, this book is a mishmash of Betty's own beliefs, upbringing, and distorted images. Maybe she dreamed she died, or she hallucinated one night. Or maybe she originally wrote this as a novel, and when it didn't sell, decided to pass it off as a real life story.hmmm.

B00001IVOR|4.0|I THINK THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY GREAT, ESPECIALLY THE TRACKS WITH METH AND ODB. WHEN ODB IS ON ANY TRACK HE MAKES IT OFF THE HOOK. I GAVE IT A 4 BECAUSE A COUPLE OF THE SONGS ARE JUST GARBAGE, BUT WERE PUT ON THE ALBUM ANYWAY. OVERALL THOUGH I DONT THINK I COULD GET TIRED OF THIS ALBUM. IT HAS GREAT BEATS AND THE LYRICS ARE OF COURSE OFF THE HOOK. IF U LIKE WU U GOTTA GET THIS ALBUM. THIS ALBUM IS OVERALL PROBABLY 1 OF THE BEST THAT I'VE HEARD IN A WHILE.
B000002BVN|3.0|i know mike can do better than this.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie since it's run in the theater's back in 1976.I remember going to the theater and staying from open to close watching this movie it was my all time favorite as a teenage.This movie is a masterpiece the camera angles. the special edition is great with cast interviews and making about the movie is fantastic.I cant says enough good about the dvd i have watched it 6 times in 5 days.Just buy it you wont be sorry.Also take a look at the wonderful 70's fashion.I truly love this film.
B00003CXP1|2.0|Like the director's first film, Pi, this film is a lesson in heavy handedness. Just like Pi, Requiem is tremendously overrated. Also, it is a great example of how to let an annoyingly hip soundtrack destroy a movie.<br />Basically, we learn that drugs are bad. So bad in fact, that you will turn into a whore, your arm will fall off and appliances will attack you if you do them. Also, if you take what otherwise looks just like a Gap ad and do lots of close ups and quick cuts, the general movie going public will consider you &quot;deep&quot;.<br />Pass.
6302814359|3.0|This film sets out to get some laughs and screams. It is not a serious film such as Dawn of the Dead and should not be evaluated as such. It has some good scares and features zombies, but also has some good scenery such as the graveyard and the eerie feeling neighborhood under construction. It is not as scary as the first ROTLD but ressurects the things that made the first one enjoyable. Do not buy this movie if you like serious horror films and good acting! I enjoyed this spoof of the Romero 'Dead' films, just don't expect anything thought provoking!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Amazing Amazing Amazing. Every time I saw this movie I loved it more. If the gods of Hollywood smile on me, Come What May will be nominated for best song from a movie (if you are reading this after the 2001 Academy Awards, please ignore my pertaining statements), and I may be able to see the luscious Ewan McGregor and the truly enchanting Nicole Kidman sing live for the awards ceremony. I really can't find the words to express the feelings that Moulin Rouge evoked in me... Moulin Rouge contains the presences (lyrics/melodies) of David Bowie, Elton John, Marilyn Monroe, T. Rex/Marc Bolan, Madonna, Paul McCartney, the Police, Patti LaBelle, Joe Cocker, Nirvana, Dolly Parton (or Whitney Houston, depending on who you associate with &quot;I will always love you&quot;), Kiss... Impressive (&amp; eclectic) list? Trust me, there's even more. Watch this movie. Buy this movie. You won't regret it. Timeless music with an even more timeless and beautiful love story. How can you go wrong?<br />Also recommended: Strictly Ballroom. Only our dear Baz could make a movie about professional ballroom dancing enjoyable.
0792151712|2.0|How this movie ever managed to be touted as the &quot;best of 1997&quot; is beyond me. What is even further beyond my comprehension is why people kept going back to see it again and again. Four words to sum up this movie: Stupid plot; horrible acting. For the record, I have seen Leonardo DiCaprio give some brilliant performances in movies such as &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; but in this, he's completely dull. And Kate Winslet: WOODEN!!!! She seemed completely unable to comprehend the emotion in the dialogue: &quot;I-will-jump-I-swear-I-will&quot; or whatever the heck she said. Completely without feeling. Okay, the set was out of this world and the boat sinking was a pretty good piece of cinamatography but beyond that, this movie should have sank. I should point out that I am a big &quot;Titanic&quot; buff and have seen every movie version of this horrible nightmare that I've ever heard of. This was the absolute worst.
0385335482|1.0|I'd rate this novel on the level of a Danielle Steel novel where unrealistic expectations of finding a solution to the &quot;money problem&quot; are just as unrealistic as finding the &quot;perfect love.&quot; One of the few books I've read where I want both my money and time spent reading it back. Shopping as addiction isn't all that amusing and the writing was of poor quality. I kept hoping it was a parody, but no such luck. And what's with the ending??? Since when does more money really spell the end of all our worries? If given no self control, most will spent above their income limit, whatever it may be. Does that mean we're in for a sequel? Hope not.
B00005NW02|5.0|more often than not, the first album a band comes out with is generally considered their best.(I.E. Stone temple pilots, korn, rage against the machine . . .). I expected this album to be good, but not great. I even told a friend of mine, &quot;their first album was great, and will be really hard to top.&quot; but they did. there isnt a song I dont like on it! my favorites are Forest and ATWA. but I never go directly to the songs, I start it from the begining, and let it play all the way though. this album is great and I had a good laugh watching the documentary video of S.O.A.D. that came with it. I highly recommend this CD. you wont be dissapointed
B0000019PA|3.0|The melodies and instrumentations are really good. The singing and sound quality are purposefully grating, but I got used to it. Unfortunately, the lyrics are embarrassingly stupid.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|...or he may kill the same person many times over.<br />I saw this movie in a theater and in a few hours completely forgot about it, until month later, when visiting the same theater suddenly recognized it among the playing features. Perhaps the film had so powerful an effect that it caused in me a condition, similar to one of the protagonist (at least in relation to the contents of the movie itself). Or may be it was a lack of emotional depth, unrelated shallow characters, and complete absence of purpose that left me nothing to remember. I tend to believe it was the latter.<br />Two stars for an honest attempt at originality.
B000021YQV|5.0|The first time I plugged into SOD I was a little miffed at the unique sound of this guys voice. I must say I didn't like it, at first... until the guitars kicked in with their punk-like metal riffs and this guy's screaming in perfect harmony. I was addicted ever since.<BR>This album not only compliments their first but is better. The songs are more dynamic and slighty more hard-core. The lyrics have a message ranging from drugs to relationships to politics to give each song a purpose. Spin this CD, I highly recommend it.<BR>&quot;...and... ...angels... deserve... to... ... DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made! After seeing it in theaters I knew I would have to buy it on DVD. Great sound and visuals on the DVD and pretty nice special features. I really enjoyed the &quot;newspaper article&quot; that helped explain a few confusing parts. I highly recommend this movie.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I enjoy animation, especially when the art in it has been pushed to the nth degree.  Hubby is a hard convert though.  I did get him to watch this film though and he hasn't liked an animated film this well since I got him to watch Bashki's \\"American Pop.\\"  So we have two five star votes for this film.  It is legend oriented, set in a forest with spirits, rulers, warriors and so forth.  The animals all talk too and are key characters as well.  The story is engrossing but probably not any more so than a really well done fairy tale.  Where it pulls out all the stops though is the artistry that goes with the storytelling.  The art work of the forest spirit alone is absolutely incredible and that is hardly the only thrilling moment.  I saw \\"Shrek\\" this past summer and in my mind there is no comparison between the two films.  I enjoyed \\"Shrek\\" but I loved this film.  It is not for small children though as it is violent and there is a lot of mayhem and blood.  Probably \\"American Pop\\" still is in No. 1 position for me with animation because of the more sophisticated story line but \\"Princess Mononoke\\" certainly has #2 position firmly locked up now.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000001FS3|5.0|This CD will never seem dated, the songs are timeless and Bono's voice never sounded better.  Very passionate vocals!  Destined to be a &quot;classic&quot;, if not already in your collection, it is a &quot;must-have!&quot;  The Edge's soaring guitar make this great &quot;road-music&quot;.  Even the videos that went along with this CD were great, too, especially since all the songs were written about the good ole USA...warts and all!  SUPER!

630575067X|4.0|This movie is great.  A wonderful introduction to the Skywalker family and the Star Wars Saga.  It was fun and made you cringe when you remembered this cute boy who saves the day becomes Darth Vader.  Here's the deal though: much like A New Hope was told from the point-of-view of a naive farm boy, Episode I is told from the point-of-view of a 9 year old ex-slave.  It is about a 9 year old boy.  It contains a lot of stuff 9 year old boys would enjoy. Embrace this and you will love the movie.  I know I did, and I am not a 9 year old boy.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies was perhaps my favorite movie as a child of the 80's.  Watching the movie again brings back fantastic memories.  This is a movie that the entire family will enjoy.  Nothing like a search for pirate treasure while avoiding an infamous family of criminals to get your heart pumping!  To top it all off, the cast of mostly then-unknown-now-renown stars succeeds in bringing out the kid in all of this<br />The DVD is fantastic!  The crowning feature is undoubtedly the cast and director commentary.  This is how commentary was meant to be done!  The screen shows the entire cast along with director Richard Donner sitting at a table with microphones while simultaneously showing the actual movie in the corner of the screen, so you can see both what the actors are commenting about and exactly what their reactions are.  Through the commentary you definitely get the sense that The Goonies was as much a joy to make as it is to watch.
0790732017|5.0|The star power alone is worth watching. Steve McQueen shows even more depth than in his other great films such as the Getaway, and The Great Escape. Dustin Hoffman gives a tremendous performance, and could be his best out of a respectable film career, which includes movies like Outbreak and Rain Man! Directer Franklin J. Schaffner tops his gritty WWII film Patton in this great tale of the only man to break frome the notorious Devil's Island. Based on the true story of Henri Chairree you will be blown away in this classic film.
0792844890|5.0|I thought this was a very funny movie. Of course when you watch it enough you can watch is in a foreign language and you still know what they are saying. This is what my family does. It is funny in different languages. I think its just all around a cool movie.
0380817683|5.0|I cannot praise this book enough. It definitely transcends the genre of British Chick Lit (and dont get me wrong, Im a big CL fan). Its funny and witty and full of romance, but its also dark, shockingly painful, and full of realistic loneliness. Keyes masterful storytelling sucks you in  the books starts out breezy and full of laughs (even though we find Rachel, our protagonist, in the hospital after shes almost killed herself with an overdose). Her family whisks her out of New York City and back to Ireland, to rehab. The use of flashbacks can be tricky  in the hands of less adept writers, theyre jarring and annoying  but Keyes uses flashbacks to carefully reveal to us just what a horrible, horrible mess Rachel was. At the same time, you get inside Rachels head, and despite what a wretched mess she is, you start rooting for her. The supporting cast is perfect, and they evolve too  as you read, Luke moves from a macho caricature to a wonderful, sweet man (that the old Rachel truly didnt deserve!) But how many of us have had times in our lives when we felt about a wonderful guy the same way that the bad Rachel did about Luke  too caught up in what was supposed to be cool to notice the things that really matter. I especially found sister Helen to be a hoot  at first I didnt like her character, but by the end you see that she loves Rachel in her own way and wants her to be well.  Overall, you get much more than just a piece of lightweight fluff with Rachels Holiday, its funny and ultimately romantic, true. But its thought-provoking and inspirational, as well.   Id also recommend Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married but Rachels Holiday is in a class of its own. (Although I do have Watermelon in my stack of books to read  the story of Rachels big sister.)
B00003CXSP|2.0|This is probably the most disgusting movie I have ever seen.  All of this is throughout the movie and I can not believe that people paid to see this movie.  I was anxious to see this, but never got around to it.  once I rented it on DVD though, i was glad I didn't spend six bucks to see this movie.  The end is the most disgusting thing I have seen in years.  What saves this movie is the brilliant performance of Anthony Hopkins.  He should be nominated for an Oscar.  Julianne Moore is dry ans boring as Clarice.  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, rent this just to see another part of the story.  Do not buy it though if you truly like it.
0375703861|5.0|This book is amazing. The huge cast of characters are confused, emotional and \\"involved\\" in a web of relationships that they can't seem to figure out how to handle. It gorgeously describes the clash of cultures, even within families. And though I love the story and the characters, the writing is what sets it apart. Each carefully crafted paragraph reads like Zadie Smith has been writing this in her head for years. Each line fits into place like an insane literary jigsaw puzzle.
0784011222|5.0|I know many hate this film, but i don't understand why?, it delivered what it promised &quot;non-stop action&quot; i don't know what people were expecting? i mean lets face it, it may not have the emotional depth that part II had but it definately plays on the political atmosphere that was occurring at the time (1988) the invasion of Afganistan by the Soviets who pulled out right at the time of this films release, i think to much hype ruined this film's potential to be entertaining pretty much the same way hype ruined &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; potential to be entertaining, i don't know why hype ever gives people the impression that is might be the second coming or somthing, just enjoy this for what it is &quot;escapist entertainment&quot;.
B00003CXSP|1.0|STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM!  If I could give it less stars, I would.  First, I absolutely love, LOVE, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;.  It is an all-time classic.  &quot;Hannibal&quot;, is a weak excuse for a sequal.  Hopkins and Moore were great in the parts they were given, but the suspence that made the first film so great is completely absent in this one.  &quot;Silence&quot; was a big movie that felt like a wonderful small film.  It was artistic, enthralling, and spine-tingling.  &quot;Hannibal&quot; is predictable, boring, and laughable.  I know we live in the age of actions movies, digital audio, and two hour music videos, but come on.  Ridley Scott should not have been allowed within 1,000 miles of this story.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|I'm 17 years old, and this is some of the best music i've ever heard in my life. This box set contains great alternative rock, punk, garage, heavy metal and pop music from 1965 to 1968. The sound quality is fantastic, and the songs sound so timeless. Each cd in this set is a unique revelation of rareness. Some songs are top 40 hits, and many are just lost NUGGETS that are golden baby. These bands were influenced by The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Kinks, and Bob Dylan. They have raw power and energy, and maybe some of the artists on this box set could have been right up there with the best, but unfortunatley for some reason they weren't big. It doesn't matter what age you are, this box set has something for the young and old. Get this great set, and you'll be surprised how excellent this music really was! The booklet that comes with this package is beautiful. It has tons of photos,history, and iformation on all of the bands featured in the set. If you've been let down on your recent cd's, this will make up for them all. Grab a neon duck, and shave the moon's face.
0312243022|4.0|I wanted to write, \\"Drop this book and go read Virginia Woolf at once,\\" but I became so engaged in it that I couldn't take my own advice. Cunningham has borrowed heavily and successfully from Woolf's style and plots, using them to explore the fluidity of emotions and thoughts and how they affect our perceptions of life. Woolf remains inimitable of course, but The Hours manages to find a ground of its own on which to stand.<br /> Cunningham practically paints his words onto the page, liberally using the names of colors to punctuate a mood - red, blue, green, white and, more than forty times, shades of yellow. In the apartment of Richard (the writer who \\"tried to split the atom with words\\"), yellow colored walls call for recognition of Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper, an earlier story of mental decline. There is a near Joycean moment, a \\"plump and stately man\\", in a night scene outside London, and no doubt other literary allusions of which I was not aware as the author creates his multiple worlds of psychological and visual imagery. He gets so much of it exactly right (a child's relationship with his mother, Woolf's attitude towards writing, Richard's apartment), that I didn't mind the bits that were less satisfying. <br />Through his characters (four of them really: an editor, a mother, a prize winning novelist and Woolf herself), Cunningham examines the process of creativity and writing well, calling it \\"an inner faculty that recognizes the animating mysteries of the world . . . the most profound satisfaction.\\" Some readers may be put off by the intense psychological focus, but when he states that we are all \\"both afflicted and blessed, full of shared secrets, striving every moment,\\" always hoping to produce something of beauty, who would disagree? While authors may be criticized for writing novels catering to literary subjects and interests, I don't see that as a fault; in this case it's wonderful. I also applaud this novel winning the Pulitzer if doing so leads to greater understanding of the prevalence of mental illness, which still exists despite modern pharmacological advances.
B00000K2SE|5.0|Although the plot is a bit trite (&quot;the one&quot;), this is a wonderful film. The SFX and the revelation regarding &quot;what is the Matrix?&quot; are alone enough to make this a must own.
B00000JZI9|5.0|&quot;Modern&quot; western films tend to be dark and depressing, but Silverado is a happy exception. A sterling cast and excellent director give new life to the standard story about big rancher versus little homesteader. This is a movie styled after the &quot;old-time&quot; westerns, where stalwart good guys defend the little folk before riding off into the sunset. Great action, a hefty dose of humor, and brilliant cinematography all help to make Silverado one of my all-time favorite films.
B000056K04|4.0|Normally you find bands that play harder music soften up with time.  What a change to find a band that goes the reverse.  With Everyday DMB manages to drop the jazzy sound for a more straight forward rock\pop sound.  It is no suprise that loyalists are put off by this and they have every right to be.  I was put off by U2's escapades into American Pop with Zooropa and Pop Mart.  If you appreciate the artist and have an affinity for his range then you will appreciate this album.  You may not love it but it will not dissapoint you and I bet you will find that it fits a mood that DMB may not have been able to do in the past.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|The state of confusion I am left in after watching &quot;Memento&quot; is one that is as thought-provoking as it is maddening. The plot twists and surprises that director Christopher Nolan employs in his energetic, frenetic script are intelligent to a fault, ones that tease the mind for hours after the film has ended. And while I was still left with questions about certain plot points and character relations, I was nonetheless enthralled by the experience. <br />At the center of this frenzy is Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a former insurance investigator in search of the man responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. His search is complicated by the fact that, due to his inability to create new memories, his short-term memory is of no help. He quickly forgets the beginnings of conversations with those he comes in contact with; his only way of staying on track are small notes on paper, Polaroids of those he meets and their names, and homemade tattoos that cover his chest and left thigh. <br />And here's a surprising twist: the film is told from the end to the beginning, starting out with what should be the film's climax and taking things from there to the very beginning of Leonard's search. This is little more than a device, though it tends to make us ponder the film's many machinations on a much more intricate level of thought. There is more to keep up with, which makes it even more interesting. <br />As we progress into the film, we are introduced to characters that Leonard has already interacted with at some earlier point in the reversed story. By the movie's midpoint, many of the puzzle pieces are in place: Leonard has been receiving help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is out for revenge against someone who took the life of her own love. At the same time, Leonard interacts with the man we see him killing in the beginning, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who offers him information we automatically assume is bogus. <br />Or is it? The movie keeps this a secret even after its ending, inviting us to think on the subject, to ponder on the film's many turns and spins. There are so many questions that come to mind: who is really responsible for the murder of his wife? Who is the real ringmaster behind all of the mayhem that goes on throughout the film? Who is the mastermind? By the time we finish thinking about it, we're more concerned with who is on top rather than who killed Mrs. Shelby. <br />And that is precisely what makes this such a fascinating film. It will turn many off for its lack of a final resolution that is blatantly obvious to everyone, but those in the mood for some deep thought will not pass this up. The ending provides no answers, no easy solution to its complex formula of mystery, leaving we, the viewers, to ponder the final conclusion in our own minds, and decipher what has just come to pass in front of our eyes. <br />The film has its share of effective performances that range from subtle mysterious to all-out masterful. Guy Pearce brings a hushed fervor to his character, embodying Leonard with an inner willpower that keeps the film at a fever pitch. Carrie-Anne Moss is eerily mysterious as Natalie, whose intentions play a bigger role than you would first consider. Joe Pantoliano gives his character just the right appearance, that which instills a great sense of suspicion for his character, Teddy, who uses Leonard's memory loss to his advantage. <br />My advice to anyone who sees &quot;Memento&quot; is simply this: don't give up on it. Appearances can be deceiving, and this is a fine example of that. Nolan's reversal device enhances rather than diminishes the movie's effects, perhaps because it allows us the chance to give serious thought to the events going on. I entered into this realm of filmmaking not knowing what to expect; I came out with a thought-produced headache of pure satisfaction.
B00003CXXI|1.0|This is one of the most ugliest pieces of ... I ever seen. The characters in it look like corpses of animation. DON'T BUY IT OR EVEN SEE IT!
B00005LKHW|5.0|The difference between the R and unrated versions is 15 seconds of the pie humping scene. You can decide whether its worth it to purchase it just by reading that.
B000005JA8|4.0|I've only listened to thing five or six times (I finally broke down and bought it, on 180g vinyl, no less, after hearing for years how brilliant/insane it was), but I hear a little more each time I play it, and that's ALWAYS a good sign. Difficult? Yes. Annoying? Kind of. But none of that, for some reason, seems to matter -- all I wanna do is play &quot;Ella Guru&quot; again and again and again.....
B00004U8H4|5.0|The difference between the R rated version and Unrated version of American Psycho is 20 seconds........That's the bottom line...... To be technical, about 18.5 seconds. In the scene with the 2 prositutes, the unrated version shows more explicit footage through the black and white video camera shot screen for about 8 seconds and the other 10.5 is a brief oral shot, with another foreign shot of a woman lying flat on the bed, breasts exposed............. <BR> The three-way scene last 41.5 seconds on the R and one minute flat on the Unrated version. It is such a minor difference, it really doesn't matter which one you view. The DVD has superior picture quality and an anamorphic transfer. BOTTOM LINE: IN ALL REALITY THE R-RATED VERSION FOR THAT ONE SCENE HAS FAST EDITING AND SEEMS UNEVEN. The song Sussudio by Phil Collins is cut away quickly in the R rated version to allow the picture to quickly catchup to the dialog........ Sounds complicated I know, and won't matter to most people.<BR>THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SUPER UNRATED VERSIONS THAT HAVE SEVERAL EXTRA MINUTES OF JUICY FOOTAGE.
B00000ICN5|4.0|This CD is amazing. Forget about Stevie's guitar playing, he absolutely has no equal in that department, the music just flowed from his hands, but there was something extra special about Stevie that I have never seen in another musician, something very magical. He also became completely lost in his music when he was performing, and that's the best and most enjoyable kind of music of all, its the kind of music that you can feel. I am still very sad that Stevie is gone, because I'm afraid that I will never have the pleasure of experiencing another musician like him again. As great as Hendrix was, I personally believe that there was a special quality to Stevie that even Hendrix himself didn't possess. Don't just buy this album, buy all of Stevie's recordings and videos. Believe me, you won't be sorry, unless you don't love great music that flows from the soul, because that's exactly what you'll get with Stevie. There is just something missing from this world with Stevie gone, but at least we still have a part of him that he left behind, the music that he created. I only gave it 4 stars because I like his live performances the best, and most of these recordings were done in the studio, but it really is a 5 star album, as long as you own this along with his other recordings.
B000000XCK|5.0|I really like this old band!!! There is one thing that all old rock had and that some of today's rock has lost: it expressed a great joy of life, it inspired love for life. And CCR surely are one of the best examples, because their music had another quality that today's rock has completely lost: it had humour!!! Just listen to songs like \\"Cameleon\\" or \\"Hey Tonight\\"! But PENDULUM is also the album of one of the most beautiful rock-ballades ever written: \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain\\"! And if you really like rock'n roll you'll surely enjoy the instrumental part of \\"Pagan Baby\\": when I listen to it, I simply can't stay quiet! So this is really a complete album and it is really good music for a party: just try it out and you'll see.
B000056NX4|4.0|The definative version of Jesus Christ Superstar is now available, and I must say I am pleased. For the majority of the cast, the voices and overall acting were on-the-dot. It was much better than the 1973 movie, and the energy of a live performance shone through, which is usually difficult in transferring stage to film.<BR>My only problem was with Glenn Carter. His voice was too sweet, even in the more confrontational sequences, and he couldn't hit any of the necessary high passages for Jesus without going into an extremely weak falsetto. His acting was all right at best in many parts, and in other parts, abyssmal. He is even smiling while he chases out the moneychangers.<BR>However, Jesus can really be overlooked in such a show as Superstar, as he is merely a central character around whom all the action revolves. The rest of the cast is sensational at worst. Special kudos to the lighting at the beginning of the betrayal, and to making the priests into illuminati.<BR>The only other bad thing I have to say is on the part of the directors.  Judas becomes too evil too quickly, and we don't see his emerging doubts.  These particular decisions are usually more in the hands of directors than actors, so I'll lay it on their doorstep.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is definitely the best one I've seen in the last year or so.  It is a very smart movie that will appeal to all ages.  In addition to being beautifully animated and well-voiced, it is also extremely funny.  It is a fun-filled movie that never gets boring.  It is entertaining and deep enough to reach people of all ages.  In other words, Shrek is a MUST-HAVE in your DVD collection.  It is far too good to miss!!
0061020680|4.0|DEATH wants to take a break. So who has to take over the task? A lot of souls out there waiting to be processed, y'know?<br />Easy. Get an apprentice. Experience not important. Horse, scythe and all the curry you'll ever need.<br />But dont get too involved with your...eer..'clients'. Thats what Mort did, though. Saved someone who was supposed to die just because he thinks she's cute. But the world doesnt like that. When a person who's supposed to die is still walking around, things begin to turn pear-shaped.<br />So DEATH (no, Im not shouting) needs to sort things out. But where is he? He joined a conga line and is having a jolly time.<br />This is where the Discworld books start to become laugh out loud funny. The first three books was okay but 'Mort' is the book where Pratchett finally found his funny bone and infects everyone with the laughing disease.<br />Those who have yet to start the fun ride through the Discworld and the great city of Ankh Morpork should start their journey here. <br />Enjoy.
B0000027G6|5.0|I must confess to the world that this is my most favourite sound theme that I have ever heard in my life. The title &quot;The Love Theme&quot; is most appropriate for a piece of music of such grandeur and beauty, something which I am sure many listeners would agree.<br />Forgive me if I may sound a little too exaggerated here, but very few music has struck such a chord in the heart as this particular piece. So simple, so soft, yet majestically grandeur and beautiful! I give my salute to the composer. Bravo!
6305181772|5.0|I was one of the people (it seems the minority) who understood the plot for this movie, and it was excellent. I was a big fan of the original series, and I expected a lot. Well-done, unlike #2 which suffered from incoherence and a lack of intelligence, not to mention tremendous overstylizing. You will have to watch this brilliant thriller at least three times so as to get all of the plot twists down. The story is about a team of coverts deep inside the bowels of the CIA that can bring down any dictator, recover any object, and even assume the identities of celebrities and schmooze. Jon Voight takes the role of Jim Phelps, the only character returning from the TV series. Tom Cruise is an everyman, but he is most similar to the Martin Laudau character. Emilio Estevez is a techno-geek with creativity to spare, much like Greg Morris' character. Both the women try to take over Barbara Bain's mixture of sensuality and intelligence, and although Hannah appears little, Claire nearly steals the film. What happens is a plot to expose a spy and protect agents fails. All of the agents on Ethan Hunt's team are seemingly dead. Who is behind it, and why? The answer to who the traitor is lies with the enigmatic Max, who Ethan must entrap to clear his name. Throughout the movie there is some fascinating posturing as first Claire, then Jim are found alive, and all three must piece together what happened and expose the traitor. Several memorable scenes: The aquarium exploding, the Terminal Room (of course!), and the bullet train segment are simply eye-popping. Why this movie got so much negative reactions puzzles me. Maybe people wanted guns and gore for their summer film instead of spies and intrigue. Before you become prejudiced, see it for yourself.
0345441184|4.0|I picked up &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; after seeing ads for the TNT movie.  I was intrigued by the idea of a retelling of the King Arthur saga from the female perspective.  As a child I was fascinated with King Arthur story, but always wished there was more about the women.<BR>This book was so much more than I expected.  I learned a lot about pagan and Druid religions and a lot about what the &quot;new&quot; religion of Christianity meant for these people.<BR>Morgaine (Morgan Le Fay) has always been portrayed as evil, but as the main character of this book, she was very sympathetic.<BR>The only complaint that I have of this book is the length.  I am normally not intimidated by long books, but this one could have used some editing.<BR>I highly recommend it nonetheless.
0060245867|4.0|As a children's librarian I often heard parents refer to this title affectionately; now, as a parent, I more fully understand the wonderful feeling of curling up with one's child and reading about this demanding little rodent, who proceeds from demand to demand until his accommodating friend is exhausted.<br />The illustrations are packed with humorous details, and the image of the mouse splayed out drawing with crayons is a hoot.  Young and old will enjoy this little classic.
B00000K0DT|3.0|The script is both the hero and the villaim in this film.  Undoubtedly well-written, with abundant (albeit expletive laden) wit, the script establishes characters of great potential interest but fails to develop them.  Gabriel Byrne's character in particular contains elements that beg to be explored - a former corrupt policeman, now reformed thief, in a relationship with a lawyer, trying to live legitimately, with ties to a club-footed conman: one might expect some complex and conflicting motivations to be played out in the plot - surprisingly, the character quickly becomes one-dimensional.  The fact that Kevin Spacey's conman is largely 'narrating' the film only deepens this problem, since he refuses to complicate his own relationship with any of the characters in the tale - he is an inarticulate 'friend' of Byrne, and simply distant and untouched by any of the others.  Frankly, I don't think the central conceit of the film necessitates this failing.  The convolutions of the plot actually boil down to a fairly straightforward premise, and when one finds this out, one can wonder why all the convolutions were necessary, and, for me, this makes it difficult to care about the film as a whole - it means the plot, while coherent, is poorly motivated, and as already mentioned the movie fails as a character study.  Still, the acting is by turns subtle, convincing and humorous, and the 'myth' of Kaiser Szozy (?spelling)  is a suggestive and cleverly dramatised idea.  The film is a highly polished product.  Yet I'm not sure why anyone would want to see this twice, aside from trying to fit a loose piece here or there into the overall puzzle - there are no illuminating insights into human nature, no compelling relationships, and the visuals while competent are hardly memorable.  It's a bit like seeing a skillful magicain perform a complicated trick - very entertaining, even thrilling, but with little connection to one's emotions.
B000059T1V|5.0|Muddy Waters is, and probably always will be, the very epitome of the blues to me. Any blues fan knows that the blues is best when performed live. Newport 1960 is probably Muddy Waters' best live recording. It comes from the era when he was at his creative peak. This CD is a must-own for blues fans. Muddy goes through such classics as Hoochie Coochie Man, Baby Please Don't Go and Got My Mojo Working as well as newer (then) material such as I Got My Brand On You and Tiger In Your Tank (the studio versions of which are also included on this remastered version). If you like Muddy Waters or blues, be sure to pick up this CD.
020530902X|5.0|White and Strunk's Elements of Style is still, several decades after its initial publication, the definitive book of its kind.  The book is not only useful, it is remarkably readable.  The authors advocate clearer, simpler prose, and this slim volume reflects their minimalist philosophy of writing.<br />E.B. White brought similar honesty and grace to his still classic essays and to beloved children's stories such as Charlotte's Web and Stuart Little.  Literary-minded readers of Elements of Style might also be interested in Ernest Hemingway or Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  Both writers were journalists before they began to write novels, and both are well worth reading.
B000002MY3|5.0|FOr any of you that don't know, JLP is the number one selling album by any female artist in history, with over 30,000,000 sold. THis CD is phenomenal. Every song has it's own personality and everyone can relate to one song or another, whether it be &quot;you oughta know,&quot; which is primarily women's. &quot;Perfect,&quot; is for anyone with low self-esteem. Mary Jane, I believe is her personification of someone addicted to marijuana, which appeals to MANY people everywhere. Everyone &quot;has&quot; a song on the cd, so don't worry about liking it or not. Listen to everything and you'll like it all!
0876855575|3.0|Bukowski is the writer that pimpley-faced middle-class boys turn to when they want to feel a bit bad, a bit tough. He isn't a very good writer but he is the dirty old alcoholic uncle you (perhaps) wished you had when you were younger. 'Ham on Rye' is certainly not literature but it might amuse you, particularly if you happen to fall into the 13-18 year old category or enjoy Benny Hill. Bukowski is unable to articulate a single genuine emotion without resorting to obscenity. I gave it three stars as it is the funniest door prop I own.
B000023VR6|5.0|If You Like Good Gangster Rap Its Either Dre Or Tupac. Since Everyone Owns Tupac(And If You Dont Go Get That) Lets Buy Some Dre. This Albumn Is Great. you Dont Even Have To Skip A Track. Theres Some Really Funny Skits(Pause For Porno, Re-Education) Plus Awesome Rap Tracks. My Personal Favorite Is F*** You. Great Song With Snoop. Also The CD Has Cameos From MC Ren, Xzibit, Jake Steeds And Of Course Eminem. You Need This. You Need This. You..............
1572523166|5.0|There seem to be two kind of opinions about this movie. One: it's a great, fascinating, if slightly weird film. Two: It's boring, meaningless and why did anyone bother to make it? Actually, I found more reviews of the latter kind, and almost didn't buy it. Luckily, I couldn't resist. And I think &quot;The Man Who Fell To Earth&quot; is gorgous, if slightly weird. It is hard to get into and it is indeed long and sort of complicated. Than again, what's so bad with a movie you actually have to think about? Because that is what this film will do, it'll force you to think. And you do need to have a mind to think with, really. <br />&quot;The Man Who Fell To Earth&quot; is a movie so far away from anything mainstream that it just can't apply to many. I found it wonderful, there are so few really good movies out there, and this is one of them.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Yeah Im The Only Rapper Who Loves Britney Spears. It's Embarrasing But Worth It. Well, This CD To Say The Least Is A Huge Change From Her First Albumn. On Her First One She Seemed Kind Of Ditzy And A Love Slave. Now Her Songs Are More Mature And Hold More Intelligence(Although Pop Never Really Holds That Much Intelligence Anyways). Funky CD Less Poppy Than The First One. Shows She'll Oneday Be A Very Respected Artist If She Continues On This Path.
078401213X|5.0|I saw Pi for the first time about a month or so ago. It is turly one of the most brilliant and original movies of all time. It is like nothing else I have heard of or seen. Though I'm not a math thinker and my skills lie more in the aesthetic quality of movies and art, I didn't find the math jargon too distracting or too confusing. Though I didn't understand every little thing that was going on, the mystery was beautifully depicted and easy to follow. I suggest it to all who read this or hear of the movie.
B000001F3C|5.0|I admit that I'm a huge U2 fan, but this albumn never gets old. It's full of classic, clean rock that shows the soul of the young band. 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' is the obvious hit that everyone remembers, but '40,' 'Two Hearts Beat as One,' and 'New Years Day' are also amazing songs. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the Joshua Tree era of U2. This is a less mature sound, but it is sincere.
0780629450|5.0|This is my favorite of Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of Derek Jacobi, since his version of Hamlet for the BBC Shakespeare plays is my other favorite. I only wish the studio would release this on DVD!
B00005OWEG|5.0|The original cut always felt incomplete. It was a bunch of great vignettes which were just thrown together. The new footage has helped give the film breathing room which was much needed. No longer is the ship raced from one surreal incident to the next. At the same time, the new footage also helps strengthen some of the films themes.<br />Before I continue, it's worth noting that &quot;Redux&quot; isn't your typical directors cut, where new footage is simply just shoved into the film. Coppola and editor Walter Murch created an entirely new cut of the film using the original negatives. The film has also been beautifully restored using Technicolor dye-transfer prints, giving the film the Technicolor look of movies from the 40's and 50's. The colors are vibrant, rich, lush and blacks and truly black. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; was always one of the most beautifully photographed films and this new transfer helps justify that. The Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro said he cried when he saw the transfer. The remasterd sound is also spectacular. Murch has done an excellent job of putting the audience in the jungle. Now back to the film.<br />The first bit a new footage was an extension of the last scene with Robert Duvall's character, Lt. Kilgore. After giving his famous napalm speech Kilgore is informed that the waves at the beech aren't going to be as big as he expected because the napalm strike has disturbed the wind. This is a nice little touch showing the cause and the effect of the US's actions; no matter what they do, there is a negative effect. After that, Martin Sheen's character Willard, steels Kilgore's surfboard. This was another nice addition. The original version always lacked scenes of Willard before his transformation from going up the river. The scene also helped reinforce the relationship Willard has with the men on the boat; they of course all get a kick out of what Willard does.<br />The next big addition is the Playboy Bunny scene. This scene helps showhow the war has even dehumanized sex. Lance (Sam Bottoms) is in a mud filled tent and is painting the face of the bunny he is with. I thought it was great how Coppola showed how dirty sex had become. Meanwhile, Chef (Frederic Forrest) is transforming the bunny he is with into another bunny by having her wear a wing and pose the same way this other bunny did in her spread. This was a masterful way of showing how incredibly impersonal sex has become.<br />The last big addition I'll talk about is the infamous French Plantation scene. The scene started off well, but slowly went down hill. In the first part of it, the French help Willard and the men conduct a funeral for Clean (Fishburne). The men do their best job to conduct a funeral, but it's not exactly up to what a typical army funeral is. There's some great imagery in there, like the small shredded American flag which is used. The funeral scene also makes a great comparison to how Chief (Albert Hall) death is handled. By that time in the film, they are so far up the river that the Army's and American values have vanished; Lance is having a fun time with the body (the body's final resting place is the river, not the earth) while Willard and Chief are totally preoccupied.<br />The plantation scene also helped reinforce the going back in time theme, something which came up a lot in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; but never panned out so well in the '79 version of &quot;AP&quot;.<br />After the funeral there is a dinner scene with the plantation heads, and this is where things go down hill. There is just way too much dialogue in this scene and Coppola's intentions are quite transparent. The French basically give a recap of the West's involvement in Vietnam and then talk specifically about the US's presence there. It was like Coppola was saying &quot;Incase you don't know what the film is about and why the US are the bad guys in this war...&quot; Worst of all the scene dragged out and hurt the pacing of the film. Coppolaspent the last two hours communicating his anti war message visually and suddenly he just had someone blurt it all. <br />There's some new stuff at the Kurtz compound, nothing too important but it helps give us some more time to take in the last 3rd of the film; again helping to reduce that rushed feeling.<br />The end still doesn't quite work, but there is no way to fix this. The Vietnam war had no real ending, there was no climax, there wasn't one last big battle. The US simply accepted it was a war which couldn't be won and pulled out. The ending actually reflects this fairly well. Once the mad Colonel Kurtz is killed, Willard walks down to the boat, leading Lance out, who has become totally wrapped up in the madness. They then peacefully go back down the river. While something like one last battle would have given the film more of a sense of finality, that wouldn't have been staying true to the war.<br />Overall, &quot;Apocalypse Now - Redux&quot; is an extraordinary film. Coppola never wastes a even a single frame (well there was the dinner scene...) Since this film was made, I don't think anyone has ever asked so much of the audience.
B00005A46T|3.0|2nd album, heavy like hell, of course, but this band still seems to be searching for a groove. Tremorous and sometimes lyrical, occasionally a little Rage (We are), a little NIN (come see my cage), a little FaithNM... where SlipKnot has backed off on hip-hop, they seemed to have bowed towards punk (Everything Ends, Left Behind). The guitars are still way too constrained. Horror seems to be the tenor, but can't compare to Far Beyond Driven (study how an album this loose can sound so perfect). This is layered noise, complemented by sic drumming/pummelling, topped-off by the most brutal voice in the history of metal. Take away the voice and the spook, though, and you'll find the tracks to be repetitive.<br /><br />SlipKnot is the upper echelon of metal, no doubt. Slayer is simpering and old-fashioned by comparison (thanks for the fresh perspective on God, Tom). But the boys will need to get used to being compared to the best and treated like Tiger Woods.<br /><br />And this second tour lacks significant evolution. Multiple listenings reveal a few hidden nuances, but nothing really memorable will be found here. The first half is a set of would-be anthems (with few hooks to grab onto), the second half is a roller coaster, leaving you hungry for a prime finale, which Iowa does relatively well.<br /><br />This is a good and complete album, but if you told me that this was a collection of B-sides, I wouldn't be surprised, either. This means that the real pressure will be on for #3, which probably needs to appear relatively quickly. A lot of thought went into this album, but not enough genius. Next time, guys, cut loose, and bring everything you can... don't be ashamed of your influences... the first album happened for a reason. And why have 9 if you can only hear 5?
B000002NFM|5.0|Ok the prodigy are at their best,they know what to do,and in the end they make a wonderful album named &quot;Fat of the land&quot;.I dont have to say anything more ,if you arent a prodigy fan this is a good start.Simply wonderful
B0000024PC|3.0|I bought this purely for the Simon and Garfunkel. They're songs were spectacular. The other songs were okay but the sound quality of this CD is fuzzy and sounds old. I recommend going to a local music store and getting the original record for the old time sound and the quality to boot. The CD quality of this CD wasn't remastered well at all in my opinion.
B00005NW02|5.0|This Armenian quartet did the impossible in my opinion.They released a much harder and better album than their self-titled debut! The disc starts off with the quirky Prison Song.Needles is a thrash metal fest! This disc overall has better songs with real flair and catchiness.Evident are political and personal issues in their lyrics.This time around though the music truly backs up Serj Tankian's lyrics to full effect! You can feel his anger literally.They also have the dark humor needed to make the right twist.Disc 2 includes multimedia for the pc.Basically all of it is outtakes and the process in making of this album.This is undoubtedly essential and truly unbelievable.Got get this!
0316776963|3.0|Love David Sedaris, but this effort isn't as consistently funny as his previous pieces. At times he tends to go off on these self-indulgent tangents that I found pretty boring. Overall I still think he's genius.
015626224X|5.0|A modest book void of foul language sex and violence, yet a masterpiece all the same. <BR>Anyone who has been through adversity or poverty would find the book almost too honest to accept. Anyone who hasnt should be glad that one man can take you this close without having to leave the life youve been accustomed to.<BR>A true literary genius.
B000002KBD|5.0|This albums contains many great classics from Van Morrison's early days that you really don't hear much anymore.  Not to mention, this album also contains that great hit from \\"Proof of Life\\" that no one can find called \\"I'll be your lover, too\\".  Definitely a great album for those who like that early seventies folksy song of Van Morrison
B00004U28G|4.0|More dumb fun from Burt and Hal Needham, just enjoy the ride.<br />This movie probably set a record for total cast members that can't act at all, but hey, it's looks like they shot this movie over a weekend, so who cares?<br />One big mistake, this movie could have used a lot more Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.<br />They have the funniest lines in the movie along with the always great Jack Elam.<br />The voice-over commentary track was fun too, a couple of old-school movie guys talking  about &quot;makin' pictures&quot;.<br />They also tell some great stories about the real Cannonball Run race.<br />Put this one in the DVD player when you just want to relax and be goofy.
B000021YQV|5.0|toxicity is a rare cd for me... i love it... i've listened to it nonstop since i purchased it... i want to tell everyone i know how awesome it is... but... i have no words that do it justice.  i can't explain the different paths the music takes on this disc... each song is full of jagged peaks and peaceful valleys... and it all fits... and it all sounds great.  some of the songs are a bit childish at first listen... perhaps that's just a bit of culture clash... as this is not an american point of view kind of band... which is a good thing.  it is wonderful to get some diversity into today's rock/metal scene... nothing kills music like mindless repetition... if it's selling... manufacture 20 more bands just like it... well... system of a down is like nothing else... it's like someone took the best bits of faith no more, sex pistols, ramones, rage against the machine, sabbath, and infused it with this incredible desire to make their music a force for right... as well as something to make you dizzy with excitement in the mosh pit.  great, great cd... and a great band that i hope survives the ever decaying record sales for rock bands that challenge listeners... it's worth the price... but don't expect another clone band... they are loud, fast, rythmic, and utterly unlike anything out there.
B00004STW1|3.0|Al Pacino is Pappas, the first great Greek mayor of New York City in this overly complex ploitical thriller hinting at the rot underlying big-city politics.  Though the advertising and packaging of the movie focus on Pacino, the real hero is John Cusack as Kevin Calhoun, a Louisiana transplant who lives to be Mayor's eyes and ears.  Calhoun's Louisiana background hints at Huey-Long style politics and a massively powerful and successful political future of his own, but for the moment, he's jumping for bullets aimed at the Mayor.  We're supposed to see the city as Calhoun's biggest test - he's savy enough about politics, but New Yorkers with their Yiddishisms just baffle him.  <br />Unfortunately, the city plainly baffles the people who made this movie.  The story begins with a street shootout on a rainy day involving a recently released con.  The sentencing judge, the PO and the city's political bosses discover their own dirty acts as Cuisack follows the trail.  People die mysteriously and the hints of organized crime remain fairly visible.  But there's no story, only a bunch of scenes (not enough containing Pacino) hinting at the political rot, but no connetcing plot.  By the time credits roll, you're not sure what you've seen or who should take the consequences.  The flick boasts some top-flight talent (Cusack and Pacino, Martin Landau as the embattled judge, but also Danny Aiello as the political boss, the underrated David Paymer and Bridget Fonda), but they do nothing more than float through the movie.  It's not clear if Fonda is supposed to be Cusack's foil, love interest or the charachter that gets Cusack to step out of others' shadows and become the leader he knows he can be.  Little of the film comes together, but it's still worth a view.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Why is this so popular?. What is there to listen too?. If this is the way rock and roll is going, then it is dead and cannot be saved. Not that this is rock and roll, it's just plain incoherent noise. These guys get acclaim and sell millions of albums. Why?. What do they do?. You listen to the music and hear the same thing over and over again. This album is like one big long song. It is nothing that any untalented hack couldn't come up with. This is not creative or fresh. Nothing is going on with this tripe. How about we give acclaiim to people who actually sing and play instruments in a way that is actually intelligible?.
630463949X|5.0|You don't run across many people who don't like Fleetwood Mac. Their success puts them in a category that is reserved for artists that are perhaps more calculating, more commercial. You can't really categorize them. No one sounded like them before or after their success, and listening to their music was something of an obligation, a respectful obligation. Then there's all the gossip about their strife that seemed to precede any of their work.... Several decades later, &quot;The Dance&quot; brought home for me the sheer artistry of this group and of the individuals who comprise it. No one rides on the coat tails of another. Each is vastly different in personality and vocal style, but when they make their music together something profound happens. Lindsey Buckingham's solos even raise the level of transcendence. This release engineers the beauty of their performance. Little cinematic gadgetry in the video allows you to witness their stage presence (like Demme's &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;) and the audio is without precedence.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Billy Joel kept getting better and better with each new album. This is no exception. 52nd Street is a showcase of masterful writing and musicianship. The hits, &quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;Honesty&quot;, &quot;Big Shot&quot;, are, of course, highlights. The rest is just as good. One track that's a stunner is &quot;Stiletto&quot;. It has such a great groove and melody, that it's a shame it wasn't released a single. &quot;Zanzibar&quot;, ditto. &quot;Half A Mile Away&quot; is another winner. The only one I could've done without was a song called &quot;Until The Night&quot;. This is another classic from Billy. This album winning the Grammy for Album Of The Year was no fluke. The Stranger should've won too. Buy this!.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Until this film, movies based on Stephen King's work--and there were tons of 'em--were clunky at best; silly at worst.  This film showed audiences who had never read Stephen King, what the rest of us already knew: the man can write!  And, he writes about 'ordinary' life as well as--perhaps even better--than he writes his stock-in-trade fantasy horror.<br />The film revolves around four amazing characters, played by four amazing young actors.  It was soundly criticized for the harsh language used by these kids, but--even though I grew up a couple decades after the film's characters, it's the kind of language my friends and I used, to prove how 'grown-up', tough, and unshockable we were.<br />I find the dialogue in this film dead-on--honest and sincere.  Kids really do speak this way, primarily because such language DOES shock some adults to such an extent.<br />One thing that needs mentioning, beyond the fact that this film is so amazing; Richard Dreyfuss plays the main character as an adult, and also narrates some of the action of the film.  His performance is, while understated and brief, equally amazing.<br />The final scene of the film (which I won't spoil) in which the ultimate fate of River Phoenix' character, Chris Chambers, is revealed, is heartwrenching--especially given the real-life fate of River Phoenix.<br />If you're seeing this film for the first time, don't watch it with your wife.  (You won't want to cry in front of her...)<br />Keith Russell.
B000021YQV|5.0|I love every bone-crunching, headbanging moment of Toxicity! The thing about System of a Down is that they are not like any other hard rock band around. They know that in order for their heavyness to be effective, they must be softer at times. They seem to understand that intensity is nothing without buildup. If the whole album were nonstop pounding and screaming, it would get rather boring, but System knows how to mix it up with time changes, rifts, bridges, and solos. Every song is diverse and never boring. I must admit I doubted that these guys would pull off an album as masterful as their first...but they have. You can hear the album begin to mature around track 6, their first single Chop Suey!. From that point on the songs take a shift from pounding to more melodic...granted, melodic for these guys is still preddy darn hardcore, but you can't say it's all just noise. System of the Down in my opinion is the resurrection of a breed we thought extinct before: a talented, diverse, original rock band.
6304675348|5.0|This movie is one of the best horror movies out there!<BR>The whole begining was a great way to start the movie off!! I think this movie changed the face of HORROR movies. Most horror movies that came out in the last 4 years always try's to do something that was in the movie &quot;Scream&quot;! <BR>This movie will scare you to death the first time you see it... After the 3rd or 4th time of seeing this movie its not scary but you know all the mistakes that they made.  I love the movie Scream !! anyone who has not seen this movie they should definitely see it.  You wont be disappointed.  And see all the sequels... There just a good as the ORIGINAL!!!!!!

B00003CXE6|5.0|This extended version is a lot denser that what I remembered of the 2000 commercial version. The politics of Rome are explored in a lot more detail, particularly that strange power the Roman Emperor had because of his own praetorian guard that was doing absolutely everything he ordered, and took orders only from the Emperor. At the end, when the Emperor is dead or nearly dead because he is defeated and disarmed, they refuse to obey their own officer. They will obey him only when the sister comes down and legitimizes Maximus. You only meet servile people and even the Senate and the Senators are just as servile out of fear for their welfare. That could be extended to today, even if today in our democratic countries this manipulation of people is less obvious, less direct, less based on the fear of the leaders but on the fear of an external danger propped up and exploited by the leaders. Fear is still the main nerve of the crowd, and then provide them with some bread and good circus entertainment and they will follow your fears to the end of the world. The film is also extremely clear about two barbaric practices of this supposedly civilized Roman Empire. The conquest war that is not, far from it, always justified by any offensive aggressivity from the \\"barbarians\\" from beyond the frontiers of the empire. It is brutal and unequal. The advanced technology of the time is on the Roman side. Easy to win when you add to this advanced technology the military professionalism of the Roman Legion. And even so it is shown as what it is: an unclean inhumane and inhuman practice. Worse even the film shows the slave trade and the total reduction of these slaves not even to animals but to objects, properties, commodities you deal with and dispose of the way you want. What the film does not say is that the vast majority of this Roman society is composed of slaves, house slaves, garden slaves, hard work slaves, sex slaves and of course the famous gladiators, the fighting slaves. They all end in death, these slaves, a vast majority premature death imposed onto them by their masters or circumstances, but always to satisfy the desire of a free Roman citizen. The particularity of gladiators is that their end is to die in public from the hand of another gladiator or just mangled by a wild beast or some technical trap. At the top of the ladder of that death is the death decided by the Emperor himself. The film is of course extremely precise about these circus entertainments though concentrating only on the gladiators. There were many other ways to entertain the populace in the Coliseum, true entertainment always bringing death to some people down there in the arena for the real pleasure of the public. This has not changed at all, I mean the pleasure of being the witness of some gross, violent, repulsive dying process imposed onto the dying person by one or many other human beings. The only change is that it does not happen in circuses any more, and with real live, if I can say so, performances of the death of each victim. We have invented in the meantime a machine that enables us to give the illusion of seeing that and yet that does not happen for real. That is called the cinema. In the old days, the Greeks had dramatic productions for that cathartic function, but the Romans did not want anything illusionary, they wanted the real thing and they got it for several centuries with these gladiators and later the Christians, and all the time the executing in public places of all discontents, and even, when you could afford a slave, the real torturing and killing in all possible variations of your slave. We seem to forget, and this film reminds us of it, that the Roman Empire, and before it the Greek or Hellenistic empire was just based on the inflicting of death to any kind of people as the very justification of the social order, the political order or plainly your own prestige or authority. And some speak of this empire as a great period of civilization.Due to these slaves some inventions like watermills devised in the first century BCE were only exploited in the 10th century CE by the Benedictines, hence in the middle of what some call the dark ages (sorry no capital letters). A great film in this extended version.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en YvelinesDue to these slaves some inventions like watermills devised in the first century BCE were only exploited in the 10th century CE by the Benedictines, hence in the middle of what some call the dark ages (sorry no capital letters).

B00005NW02|5.0|After hearing about System of a Down and seeing the video for &quot;Sugar&quot;, in 1998, I bought their first record.  I found it extremely interesting how the band incorporates Armenian elements into their heavy metal sound; its a very unique style of music.  Their second album is better than their first in almost every single way imaginable.  The songs are more focused, there is a greater sense of melody, and the lyrics are more thought-provoking.  There is no track on this record that i skip, whenever i listen to it I listen to every song.  Thats a big compliment.
0783219172|4.0|This film is a parody, a funny horror film. A mass killer and his teenage accomplice go on the rampage in a hospital and kill a great number of people. The mass killer is electrocuted. His accomplice is sentenced to a prison term and freed after a while provided she remains under the control of her mother who makes her a recluse. This mother is the real cause of her love for the mass killer : she evades her mother's victimization and choking control this way. After her release from prison, she submits to her mother's victimization in the most humble way. But the mass killer comes back and kills many other people by frightening them into a massive heart attack. The hero, Franck, is in touch with some ghosts and he tries with these friends to neutralize and send the mass killer's ghost, along with his lover, into the limbos of hell. It is thus a parody of many other films in the horror field, but there is a heavy load of humor, even if morbid humor, in his fight against the essential killing ghost thanks to the FBI agent who is completely crazy. An entertaining film that you must watch to have a giggle and to reflect on this idea that executed criminals come back to go on with their crimes, turning the film into a denunciation of the death penalty, because a crazy criminal becomes a crazy ghost after his execution. It is in a way a call for treatment for those criminals, even if they might be executed afterwards, though it would not be justified then. If they are, at least they will be sane ghosts.

B00000099Y|3.0|I love Tool.  Undertow is by far the best Tool album ever.  This having been said, Aenima is also a very good album, however it doesn't quite live up to the standards that were set by Undertow.  The problem here is that the album is simply too...long.  Some of the tracks just go on for too long, and while Maynard's voice helps to keep it somewhat interesting, it ends up just being physically draining to listen to this album all the way through.  There are however, some fantastic moments on this album, and no Tool fan should be without it.  However, casual fans should stay away, because they will be dissapointed.
B000003N89|4.0|Not as unified an album as WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES, which I consider her masterpiece, Krall still manages some wonderful performances on this tribute to the Nat King Cole Trio.<br />I highly recommend it for after dinner music and just over all lounging around.<br />Krall's sultry delivery is one of a kind and she is perhaps the most gifted contemporary jazz vocalist.

0393314804|5.0|This is one of the one hundred greatest fiction works of the twentieth century. I'm not joking. This is the book that launched Welsh as a prominent author. It spawned heroin-chic. They even made a great movie out of it.
0920668364|5.0|I work at a school, and when I read this to my preschoolers, they loved it. Not only did they listen to the entire book, but towards the end they were singing along with me. This a favorite of all the kids. And has the potential to be a very sentimental book for parents and children. I give it 2 thumbs up.
0790734850|5.0|When I first went to see this film, it was only because it was based on James Ellroy's novel of the same name.  The amazing thing about this film is that it actually captures Ellroy's terse narrative into bottles that lightning on the screen.  The only problem I have with the adaptation is that Ellroy provides no redemption at the end of his novel, as the guilty continue on, while the film demands some affirmation of redemption.<BR>  I agree with all of the other reviewers that the performances in this film are uniformily the best that these actors have given, with the exception of Spacey (I still prefer his work in The Usual Suspects).  What is wonderful about this film is that this is the quintiscential American mystery film.  Unlike mystery films or police dramas anywhere else, where the investigation eventually leads to a single individual, the American mystery film starts off with a single act, and like a pebble in a pond, radiates out into its own corrupt little world until it encompasses a massive conspiracy.<BR>  A wonderful film overall.
B00000IQC8|5.0|For a movie that was made for no money has become one of the most popular indie films ever made!!  Dante and Randal the stars of the film are perfect together, and have excellent chemistry, and comedic timing. The language is not for the tame, or timid, but it seems pretty accurate to me so the faint hearted be warned. The film explores the customers that they must endure on a day to day basis while spending their lives working at the Quick Stop, and RST Video. From insane requests of cold coffee, and nudie books in the restroom to which film was better Return of the Jedi, or Empire Strikes Back (Empire!!!). Dante, and Randal carry on, and try to solve the world's problems, and their own in this first installment of the Jersey Films Trilogy.  Buy it, rent it, or (as Jay would do) steal it.  Enjoy it for what it is, and leave it at that.
B00000K32J|5.0|I loved &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; the first time I watched it. So naturally, I was exploring other videos done by Michael Flatley and I came across and purchased &quot;Feet Of Flames.&quot; This is Lord of the Dance taken to the next level!! The dancing is much faster and the music is great! It was also a clean, clear picture and not constant camera angle switches like in LOTD. With the returning lead roles and a massive group of dancers, Michael Flatley hits the enormous stage with a show that surely will take your breath away, and leave you in a state of astonishment! I Highly recommend Feet of Flames and Lord of the Dance for great entertainment that any age will enjoy!
6301599411|3.0|This film presents some pretty ridiculous interpretations and is extremely loose with its source evidence. With that being said, I must confess that when I first saw this film on TV around age five or so, it began a lifelong interest in ancient history for me that finally resulted in a PhD in the subject. At that tender age, my curious little noggin ate up the spectacular views of pyramids, statues, and monuments while Peter Thomas' eerie score wormed its way forever into my auditory memory bank. (So far I have been unable to find the soundtrack on CD although I have acquired a copy on vinyl. I agree with one of the other reviewers about the DVD- it looks and sounds a lot worse than most videotapes.) So, what can I say? Take with several metric tons of salt, but also take it in the spirit of fun and mysticism.
B00005B36H|3.0|This album is overated, and i think tool is getting too mainstream. its not bad to be mainstream, you know on radio n stuff, but when you're on mtv that just brings in a bunch of un-genuine fans that will listen to schism and whatever other single tool puts out from this album. its not regular tool style, but i supose they don't have to stay the same the rest of thier careers. there are good songs,  the grudge, schism, ticks and leeches, and parabola to name a few. Maynard's voice is a little unlike thier other cds, which i don't like. if you're new to tool, buy aenima, or undertow which are better. im tired of seeing all these bands that i start to like go mainstream. When i went to the store and bought lateralus, they were stockpiled next to the cd rack. im thinking     what??  than i see thier video on mtv 10 times a night, then i go to school and now everyone has all these tool shirts and loves tool and everything. it really annoys me. overall, don't buy this album if you're new to tool-it'll give you the wrong idea about them! that's all!  hopefully tool's next cd is better...
B000021YQV|4.0|After their incredible debut album, system of a down brings us this much anticipated work. The album is great for the same reason that made their first a new metal classic: system of a down sounds like no other band in the whole world, mixing savage riffs and rythims with beautifully constructed melodies. Best songs in the album are Chop suey, aerials and deer dance, which doesnt mean that the rest of them are not as good. Great album, but maybe a bit similar to the first one... Anyway, buy this record, it rocks all the way!!!!!!
B00005NW02|5.0|Back with avengances and rockin harder than ever. This CD is soooooo much better than the first one, w/o taking anything away from the first one which was great, this is definettly a great progression as a band, and they didnt loose their passion or anger like some bands of late... Tool, Staind, etc... you see the pattern. where all those bands try and be mellow and then rock like they used to cant pull it off like SOAD proved they can do AGAIN! Get this album if you're a SOAD fan you wont regret it at all.... THIS KICKS
B00005JHAB|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie. J.LO was funny, I thought, Matthew McConaughey was so sweet and so romantic in this movie. I can't wait to buy it!! Those who hated it wouldn't know a good thing if it slapped you in the face. I think everybody wants to be swept off their feet like in the movies. This is by far, one of my favorite movies!!
B00000720W|4.0|i urge those who have this album to look for its printed lyrics. simple, straight forward and downright sick. probably the sickest ever...soundwise, there's nothing to do with the newer MayheM (the newer albums showed an infinitely better and more experienced mayhem)but it's a must. the riffs are efficient and easy to remember. and back in 1987 this was certainly the heaviest sickest and scariest stuff ever released.
0805209999|5.0|I welcome Mr. Mitchell's work to the literary table. His translation of the masterwork is a crisp one. His skill is reflected best in the central character, the terribly over-accused and often hungry Joseph &quot;K&quot;. While other translators have spoon-fed us simple serial descriptions, Mitchell does far more. Indeed, Breon Mitchell's K is a special K, and one I will long remember.
B00003CXSP|4.0|I went into this movie not expecting anything, especially to the nature of Silence of the Lambs altitude. Hannibal wasn't a bad movie. However it was very predictable. The story line itself is just a \\"catch me if you can...\\" movie. No real base, no real plot.<br />I feel bad for Julianne Moore to try to replace Jodie Foster. Jodie Foster did a fantastic job in SotL. Don't get me wrong, Moore did a wonderful job but to fill Foster's role...just felt...odd to me.<br />Anthony Hopkins, I love and adore. His haunting voice carries out in this sequel. Hearing his voice sends shivers down my spine from \\"Silence...\\"... <br />I will opt to buy this movie, either VHS or DVD. I would recommend others to perhaps rent it first as it is definitely not as good as Silence of the Lambs if one REALLY expects it to be!! How many sequels are as good as the first? Not very many and therefore why should this be any different. Watch the movie to be entertained...try not to measure it up to SotL!!
B00003CXA2|1.0|i wanted to stop but i could not. this movie was so bad that i kept watching in ever-increasing disbelief and horror. this is the worst movie i have ever seen. i do not say that lightly. a bad movie can be bad because it has a low budget, or an inept maker. a terrible, shameful movie such as forrest gump can only be produced by someone who has money, skill, and pretension. by those criteria it is, in my opinion, the worst movie of all time. i watched it all the way through, my jaw dropping, eventually through the floor. stupid. yes, but many big american movies are. this movie is incredibly, painfully (and i fear unknowingly) reactionary. in its drive to find a mythical good america it teaches several appalling lessons: politically aware african-americans--bad; politically aware women--deluded, probably by african-americans; the vietnam war--an opportunity for racial harmony sabotaged by spoiled white men, deluded blacks, and confused women; happy dancing black children--they still live, protected by the shadow of the gates of forrest's late 20th century mansion. how any person could accept an oscar after tom hanks won for this movie escapes me.<br />i'm stuck with one star. minus ten would be accurate
B00005ATQ9|4.0|Stanley Kubricks's long picturesque saga of an Irish rogue in 18th Century Europe is certainly the most entertaining costume drama ever made. Each frame of the film is filled with visual splendor as meticulous as a classic painting. Panoramic battle scenes and richly detailed costume and set designs come alive as from an artist's palette. Ryan O'Neal's bogus Irish accent is easily forgiven as he seems merely a prop in the center of Kubrick's vision of European aristocracy in conflict with an Irishman's independence. The pistol dueling scenes are outstanding.
B00005NW02|5.0|I thought I was taking a risk buying Toxicity just for the hit song, \\"Chop Suey!\\". Man, was I wrong. These guys are so intense and unpredictable. Every time I thought a song was getting all wussy, they start kickin' ... again. Riding home from the store, I almost got into an accident cuz I was banging my head so hard. In this age of one-hit wonders, SoaD stands out from the rest with a CD where EVERY track RRRROOOOOOOCKS.
B0000025C0|4.0|Having been blown away by their debut album 'dont look back' certainly didn't dissapoint and infact kept up the high standard of its predecessor. where their debut didn't have any bad tracks 'dont look back'(in my opinion)has two, but not bad to the point where i'm skipping tracks,there still good songs.<BR>The classic 'dont look back' instantly takes off from where their debut left us,'the journey' is a minite and forty four seconds worth of keyboard/guitar build up before a crisp loud crack of the snare and crash cymbal takes you into 'its easy' 'a man ill never be' is an excellant ballad,and 'feeling satisfied' and 'used to bad news' cant go without a mention. at just short of 34 minites long some might find it a little short but to these ears this album is very nearly perfect.
6304118392|5.0|This film is not &quot;about&quot; the glorification of violence. It is not &quot;about&quot; the influence of the media. To see what is is about, fast forward to the scene in the motel room where the girl is held captive. In the window, images fly by at a frantic pace, belying Mickey's calm exterior.<br />These images are both experiences from Mickey's past as well as the collective past, those outside Mickey's direct experience. They are shown to be the subconscious driving forces behind Mickey's violence. What is inside Mickey now surrounds him. Stone splatters Mickey's mind upon the walls. It's brilliant.<br />This scene, and other like it in the film, go a long way to answer the question &quot;Why Mickey? Why Mallory?&quot; A fairly relevant question these days. <br />But these aren't the only &quot;invisible&quot; forces discussed in the film. Mallory senses these forces in the scenes with Russell Means. These forces exert power over the characters. They are shown as malevolent forces, seeking retribution for the killing of the grandfather. Or perhaps they are the swing of the pendulum once balance has been destroyed. In either case, they are more powerful than either Mickey or Mallory, who, up to this point in the film, have, together, controlled their worlds: the masters of death. <br />It is the first time in the film that Mickey and Mallory face consequences, an important statement in the film. <br />At the end of the film, Mickey ascension to almost superhuman power may be because he has shed the skin of his past and joined with the powerful hidden forces. He is tranformed in some way; a metamorphisis occurs in appearance as well as attitude: perspective. A shift has occurred.
B000002HMH|4.0|First things first, I totally agree with the guy that said Metallica had to make this album and you really can't fault them for it. That said, this album is mediocre as far as Metallica goes, but its still worth a try, espescially for those uninitiated to Kill 'em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets or ...And Justice for All. I usually skip the first 3 tracks on this album as they arent really anything to write home about, espescially the awful House that Jack Built. The first really worthwhile track on Load is Until It Sleeps. King Nothing is quite good, while Hero of the Day is a rather weak effort. Then comes Bleeding Me. Metallica finally does a long song, and it pays off in droves in this song. Definitely one of the highlights. Cure is also a solid track, but then the album goes downhill for a few tracks. Poor Twisted Me and Wasting My Hate are both very weak with extremely weak lyrics. However, these pale in comparison to...Mama Said. This is the one song I've ever cursed Metallica for making. Load would be so much better if they left this song off and replaced with with Devil's Dance from ReLoad and added on the final minute of The Outlaw Torn. Thorn with in ok, but not really a standout track at all. Ronnie is a compotent song, but it has great lyrics that make it worthwhile. If for nothing else, buy this album for track 14, The Outlaw Torn. This song blows everything else on Load away. With great lyrics, reasonable guitar work and that \\"wide open space\\" feel, Outlaw Torn is easily the best song Hetfield and Co. have made recently. It is the longest song Metallica has ever made at 9:52(10:48 if you have the unencumbered version on the Memory Remains single), and it uses that time beautifully.<br />In conclusion, even though this album has quite a few bad songs, they are outweighed by the few good ones. Load is definitely not as good as their previous albums, but still better than most of the [stuff] we're exposed to today. This is not an album for first time listeners(unless you listen to alternative alot). Instead, you should pick up the ubiquotous Black Album.

6303327974|5.0|This film is not &quot;about&quot; the glorification of violence. It is not &quot;about&quot; the influence of the media. To see what is is about, fast forward to the scene in the motel room<BR>where the girl is held captive. In the window, images fly by at a frantic pace, belying Mickey's calm exterior.<br />These images are both experiences from Mickey's past as well as the collective past, those outside Mickey's direct experience. They are shown to be the<BR>subconscious driving forces behind Mickey's violence. What is inside Mickey now surrounds him. Stone splatters Mickey's mind upon the walls. It's brilliant.<br />This scene, and other like it in the film, go a long way to answer the question &quot;Why Mickey? Why Mallory?&quot; A fairly relevant question these days. <br />But these aren't the only &quot;invisible&quot; forces discussed in the film. Mallory senses these forces in the scenes with Russell Means. These forces exert power over the<BR>characters. They are shown as malevolent forces, seeking retribution for the killing of the grandfather. Or perhaps they are the swing of the pendulum once balance<BR>has been destroyed. In either case, they are more powerful than either Mickey or Mallory, who, up to this point in the film, have, together, controlled their worlds:<BR>the masters of death. <br />It is the first time in the film that Mickey and Mallory face consequences, an important statement in the film. <br />At the end of the film, Mickey ascension to almost superhuman power may be because he has shed the skin of his past and joined with the powerful hidden forces.<BR>He is tranformed in some way; a metamorphisis occurs in appearance as well as attitude: perspective. A shift has occurred.
B000000OEI|5.0|This is a great cd with some great choral work and a cool main theme. There is over 70 minutes of music on this cd, even if ther is only 5 tracks. (Some tracks exceed 20 minutes in length)<BR>Buy it today
B00001QEE6|5.0|Visually stunning, filled with loveable characters. This film is easily the best Disney ever made. The characters are driven by a wonderful story that pulls you into their world. The music is incredible and will have your kids humming and singing along with the soundtrack. My 2yr old daughter and I watch it over and over. This film posseses a timeless beauty that must be shared with viewers of all ages. A must buy. Dont even bother with the sequel. It is a shadow of the original and unworthy of association with this level of greatness.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I cannot understand why this film has been poorly received by so many people. Perhaps I can only guess that at 3 hours many people are unwilling to invest the time, that the slow introduction to the characters and the rich emotional tones of this movie leave many people behind. For me this film has moved me in ways I cannot adequately describe. All I can say is that every time I watch it I come away with more.
0783225970|5.0|Al Pacino possible the best actor of all time takes on the role of Tony Montana (Scarface). Michelle Phiffer makes her acting debute in this film also.<br />Tony Montana is a political refugee from the country of Cuba and comes to Miami and is forced into a cagged community in 1983.

Tony is now to dopped up to even know whats going on but he takes out his assalt rifle/grande luncher and puts up a pretty good fight but in shot in the back and killed in the famous final scene.<br />This movie is in the top five for the best movies of the 80's. Al Pacino gives one of his best performences ever. This DVD edition has good extras with interviews with the cast and much more. Overall this is a great movie. This is a must for any movie collector.
6304698623|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie.  It's an adaption of my all-time favorite book, and figured I'd invariably be disappointed...  I was surprised to find a simply delightful movie.  Great fun.  I liked the Shirley Temple version even better!
B00005A46T|3.0|ok.  i must admit that after seeing all the new fans of slipknot and seeing them so quickly become the biggest thing in aggressive music, i thought that they were way to popular to make a good album.  they'd sell out and deliver to all those linkin park loving teenage girls who claim to like this band.  but, after getting the new release &quot;iowa&quot;, i am happy to say that they didn't sell out; but they are way overrated.  slipknot aren't the kings of metal.  they aren't the most evil, twisted, and angry band ever.  don't even insult great bands like slayer and meshuggah (who are the real holders of these titles) by calling slipknot that.  what slipknot is is a good band that makes heavy music that is easy to mosh too.  this album was much more than i expected.  they actually stayed within the metal guidelines and went and made a good album that is more than enough to satisfy any fan of hard music.  they aren't the kings;  they aren't the best;  and they certainly don't deserve all the attention they get.  but they did make a solid album that will keep you interested until something truly great comes along.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Just when i thought the only great new film writers were billy bob thorton [the gift simple plan] and m night shyamalan [sixth sense unbreakable] i come across chris nolan. I have wanted to see Memento since it was in theaters...unfortunately it never came to my area so i was forced to wait till its video release. Words cannot express how well written this film is. Its not only incredibly difficult to write a film with such an ingenous concept with the memory loss and everything, but the dialogue is great as well. That makes for good acting. The direction by nolan was glorious as well. Its not easy making a movie where you see everything backwards pretty much and do it succesfully. Deffanately one of the best films all around this year, with great direction, great story and script, and great acting...where can you possibly go wrong. Not only that but you actually have to think about what you are watching, and that my friends is something incredibly rare in today's pop culture run society. I highly encourage seeing Memento right away, there isnt a film out that is more worth your time!<br />-matt

B000002BSG|4.0|I bought this album without having heard any song except for \\"Virtual Insanity\\".  This is still one of my 5 favorite songs ever, but there are some other good songs on here that I didn't like at first.  \\"Alright\\" and \\"Cosmic Girl\\" (the two singles released after \\"Virtual Insanity\\") are two songs that sort of sound like disco, but they also have a nice funk/r&b vibe going.  \\"High Times\\" doesn't have that great of lyrics, but it has a really good chorus.  The title track and \\"Use the Force\\" are also very good.  In conclusion, this is one of the must-have albums of the past 10 years.  I would like to say though that as good as this album is, you should really check out Jamiroquai's newest release A Funk Odyssey.  In my opinion, it is Jamiroquai's best overall album.
B00005KHJR|5.0|The reviews saying the boxset does not have the full version are wrong. It has the full version. The 103 minute VHS video version is actually a timing error. It is the same length as the DVD extended version in this box set!
B000007NYS|5.0|The world finally seems to have noticed Lucinda's greatness, and she's become a mild commercial success in addition to retaining her critical cachet. If you've not heard this album, seek it out. It's Lucinda's best, yet her most accessible.<br />I'm not a huge country music fan, but I realize these songs were considered too rock for country radio &amp; vice versa when they came out, but now that popular country music seems to have shifted the emphasis to &quot;popular&quot; I think there's a huge audience out there that hasn't discovered this great album (especially since it hasn't aged a bit).<br />Lucinda never seems to work when she's writing her lyrics. On the first listen, they seem like they came off the top of her head. Once you've absorbed them, they start to exhibit a wonderful poetry. They evoke the subject matter (usually relationships in a state of shambles or ecstacy) amazingly well. She's one of our best lyricsts, and is obsessed with production, so the album glimmers with quality. <br />The resigned ballad &quot;Side Of The Road&quot; is the album's most obvious masterpiece, since it manages to spin a complex emotional tale of wanderlust while never losing its verse/chorus catchiness. Still, this is an album loaded with gems. &quot;I Just Wanted To See You So Bad&quot; is the rollicking country precursor to Cyndi Lauper's &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;. &quot;The Night's Too Long&quot; precedes the Dixie Chicks' country tune as female empowerment anthem style by a decade, but is smart enough not to suggest that an empowered woman is above a night of fun with the right man. &quot;Crescent City&quot; is the most fun track on the album; a slice of down home nostalgia that doesn't make you feel guilty for loving its simplicity. &quot;Big Red Sun Blues&quot; contains one my favorite of all Lucinda lyrics: (&quot;Sun in hanging in the sky / Sinking low, and so am I.&quot;) it's simple, metaphysical, beautiful, and packed with feeling. <br />But that's what Ilove most about Lucinda's lyrical style... as she narrates, we see her as a constant observer. The world she examines melds itself to her state of mind. Lucinda, even when at her most depressed, tells us of the beauty she sees. There's nothing that can be ignored in her music. This is an album, not just a collection of singles... and its the best in a career filled with best albums.
B00005KHJR|5.0|Buy the boxset because it contains the full version of the film. The single disc version is chopped up. This film is a 5 star film in it's full length. One of the most unique movies you will ever see.
B00000F5KH|4.0|This film is definitely better than Life Is Beautiful, which won the Best Foreign Film Oscar the year it was nominated for that award. It's like a somewhat more palateable, less brilliant version of Victor Babenenco's Pixote (which is also set in Brazil &amp; deals with the country's abandoned youth). <br />The main reason to watch this film is Fernando Montenegra's great lead performance. Her character is a cynic, and that cynicism helps disarm us as we're made to watch a little kid suffer. What could easily descend into trite emotionalism doesn't, mostly because of her work. The film's got an epic feel even though it's well under two hours long, and we get a good sampling of Brazillian culture (including some surprisingly incisive skewering of the country's religious preocupations). Overall, it's a film that is eminently watchable (and thankfully never slides into artistic pretention), and I would highly reccomend it.
B00004WIBW|5.0|I always felt that the original story was good but over rated. Well, Burton and Depp outdid the story in every sense of the word. This movie grabs us right from the start. Making Icobad an officer of the law who defied his superiors and was sent to investigate the murders in Sleepy Hollow supposedly by a headless horseman was a great improvement over the original story. Right away we are offered true horror with the shocking flashback of the horseman's death. Burton also skillfully speeds through the events of the original story and tells us in a subtle way that this movie will be much more complex. Along with Icobad, we are gradually exposed to the reality that the terror from the past has somehow worked its way into the present. (Excellent!) But the drama and suspense do not stop here! We gradually learn that the horseman: &quot;does not kill at random.&quot; So, what is the mystery behind this? Excellent suspense! I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who have not seen it. But I will say that we are actually given the option of offering the headless horseman a small amount of our sympathy. Without giving the story away, he is not exactly acting under his own will. (Shatters the boundaries of all rules! Excellent!) This movie offers us a wonderful combination of great action, drama, horror, suspense, and even some light comical moments. But the good points do not stop here! Tim Burton is not quite Franco Zeffirelli. The scenery may not quite match Franco Zeffirelli's &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; or &quot;Hamlet&quot; with Mel Gibson. But just as in Burton's &quot;Batman Returns,&quot; he offers us dramatic images that carry dignity. One common mistake HE AVOIDS is overdoing the blood and effects. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that the movie that frightened me the most was the 1979 &quot;Dracula&quot; with Frank Langella as Dracula and Laurence Olivier as Abraham Von Helsing. Well, this movie is a really close runner up. First you willenjoy trying to solve the mystery and seeing how it unfolds; then you will enjoy seeing how it all comes together. In this day and age when media  seems to have taken a turn for the much worse, it is wonderful to know that a phenomenal masterpiece like this does turn up now and then. WARNING: BECAUSE THIS MOVIE IS NOT OVERDONE IT IS REALLY FRIGHTENING. YOU MAY NOT WANT TO WATCH THIS ALONE IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO HORROR.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I am the a huge radiohead fan. I am not writing this review becsue of that fact though, I want to put the record strait. People have been saying on this review board, they should not get 5 stars because they are radiohead. Well, ok lets put it this way, yes they should. There music, although sometimes seeming complicated, show fans everywhere that they are down to earth enough to make music that they want to make, and you kow what, a little change never hurt anybody. To hose of you who disliked kid a, good riddens, you don't know genius until you go to a live radiohad show and close your eyes and get engulfed in real music. Thanks
B000024L5R|5.0|The tracks in this album are all great! Celine's songs touch peoples' lives all over the world. And this album really proves it. From the sensual &quot;Seduces Me&quot;, to the fabulous &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot;, and the uptempo &quot;Make You Happy&quot;, all music buffs can find a song here that suits them. Other tracks that I really love in this album are &quot;Falling Into You&quot;, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, &quot;I Love You&quot;, &quot;Dreaming Of You&quot; and &quot;All By Myself&quot;. The 2 Bonus tracks here are &quot;To Love You More&quot; (which is included on the US edition of 'Let's Talk About Love') and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman&quot;. There are 16 tracks in all. After listening to this Celine masterpiece, all that you can say is that she is a great diva!
0425180638|1.0|What a gigantic waste of time.  The story isn't compelling; the plot doesn't resolve itself with clarity; the characters are shallow and unlikable.  <br />To make matters worse, the author portrays every male as sex-crazed, inherently evil, and shallow.  Even the main character's male side kick is described as fat, slovenly, and shifty.<br />The only surprise in this crime/mystery is that I actually finished it.
B00003Q43A|2.0|It's truly amazing to look at this &quot;film&quot; now and marvel that it's one of the top grossing motion pictures of all time. Basically, it's a marvel of marketing. Emmerich and Devlin have &quot;borrowed&quot; ideas from really great films and clumsily placed them in their movie. They even swipe the ending of their previous effort, STARGATE (which appeared prior to that in ALIENS and the obscure MOONTRAP).   And when they're not lifting other filmmakers' ideas, they're putting in some of the most illogical concepts seen (ie, an alien computer can instantly download a program from an Apple).
B000021YQV|2.0|Ok..... Chop suey is the only good song on this cd.. if u expect that this cd will be like there Last LP that's where your wrong.. they seem to have a christian\gospel touch...insted more of a heavy metal\rock touch... if u want some real metal\rock try Slipknot,Static-x,Disturbed,Slayer,pentara and more artists like that.
6300213714|5.0|In my opinion, \\"The Warriors\\" has made its mark as a classic. It is an entertaining representation of gang life at the end of the seventies. The story line is simple which adds to the film's good flavor. The Warriors are wrongly accused and sent on the run. They must dodge and go through several different gangs and police to get home. The leader of the Warriors is played by Michael Beck(Alcatraz-The Whole Shocking Story,Triumphs of a Man Called Horse) who delivers an excellent performance as the quiet yet tough Swan. Also adding a lot to the film's attraction is the trouble-hungry character, Ajax, played convincingly by James Remar. Swan and Ajax provide an excellent contrast within the Warriors. Mercedes Ruehl also makes a short yet memorable appearance. The many different types of gangs are really fun to watch. To me, this movie has it all, action, drama, and even a small touch of romance. I highly recommend this film. If you haven't seen this film, I suggest making a night of it. I first saw this movie when I was 8 years old. I'm 23 and the words \\"Warriors....Come out to play-y\\" still are stuck in my head along with those Warriors' vests. This is one of those movies that will have you cheering for the \\"good guys.\\"
B00003CXTG|1.0|This move is not as good as i thought it would be.<BR>The special effects was really great but the actors and the stoy was a joke.<BR>I came to se an great war movie but i was wrong.<BR>When i saw this movie on the cinemas everybody in the audience started to laught when we saw the movie and acually gave the movie a thumb down for it.<br />Sorry about my english but im not an American or an English man. Im from Sweden so my English is not perfect.
6302725534|5.0|Even though some people think this film isn't good and can't stand Annie. I think, personnally, it's brilliant. The actors are great and the dancing is perfect. I never knew that such young children could dance like that but I was wrong I think Aileen Quinn made an excellent Annie.<BR>I was dissapointed when I found out the movie was originally three hours and John Huston cut it down to 2 hours. It would have been better for the three whole hours. I would recomend this movie to anyone and any age. Its defitenly worth watching
B00003CY3W|5.0|In the mid seventies, I believe, some people made a remake of the horror classic, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, my psychiatrist told me that the movie was made as a protest against Est and other conformist social movements.  Ghost World deals with the theme of what happens if you are 18 or 40 something and you're still real alive, creative and you're in a world of Body Snatchers.  I deal with the world of Body Snatchers all the time, I know a person, like Enid (the main character) who I worked with (I am a social worker in my 40's, she is in her early twenties and a clerk and alive, passionate, friendly), which she paid a high price for with her boss and some coworkers. She was easy for me to talk with, much more so than the people body snatchers.  She took the bus!  She quit and went to Spain, because she always wanted to see what Spain was like, she'll take the low cost route.  Ghost World is what's going on!  Open your eyes Body Snatcher Types.
B000007177|5.0|With the &quot;Passion Play&quot; album and the &quot;Chateau D'Isaster&quot; tapes, it is no wonder why 1973 was Jethro Tull's finest hour. The first cd is by far their most impressive work. The &quot;Chateau D'Isaster&quot; tapes, recorded in France, are more like a symphony by Bach then 1973 type music. Ian Anderson is a musical genius and a present day Mozart. My personal favorite of all Jethro Tull songs is &quot;Look at the Animals.&quot; This is one of really four songs that are not instrumental. &quot;Critique Oblique&quot;, &quot;Post Last&quot; and parts of the first three songs were used as starting points for the &quot;Passion Play&quot; album. I don't think you will find 13 more musically sound pieces on any other album. In fact one day as I was driving down the highway with a friend of mine who listens to mostly punk music. I decided to put in the &quot;Chateau D'Isaster&quot; tapes for him. He never really heard much of Jethro Tull and I didn't tell who it was. But after about halfway through the third song he said, &quot;These guys are really great musicians and this is some really brilliant music.&quot; He is a bass player by the way. As for the second cd, well, it is quite the bonus. &quot;Broadford Bazaar&quot; is beautiful. I get a little choked up every time I hear it.
B00005LMBK|1.0|there are plenty of great cd's out there to put you money into... this cd is most definiately not one of them.  if you like the clint eastwood song buy the single.  for the simple reason that all the rest of the songs on this cd are terrible.
B00000IN5G|4.0|When I heard Follow The Reaper I was so blown away that I thought &quot;No way could they have made an even better album&quot;. Quite frankly they haven't. But on the upside, this is still a much better album than most of what is out there. As always, the music has a really addictive nature, Alexi Laiho's amazing vocals and guitar leads are what really do it. Janne Warman's talent feels a little repressed here - his keyboard leads are faster, better and more fluent (not to mention more frequent) on Follow The Reaper. Very often his keyboards take the back seat until a bridge comes. But he still does a great job when he's called for. The rest of the band aren't so mindblowing, but they still all do a great job in the rythm department. My favourite songs would have to be the opener Warheart and the closer Downfall.<br />If it sounds like I'm slagging this album, I'm not. Far from it - it's a more than worthy addition to any metaller's collection. It's just that Bodom have such an amazing effect on you when you first hear them so when you buy another one of their albums that effect is obviously not gonna be there. You can't be surprised or blown away by something when you know what to expect. After much listening I've decided that Follow.. is definately the better album anyway, meaning that something that is not as good has to live up it. And if its not as good then it simply can't do that.<br />I don't mean to put anyone off. In fact, I recommend you BUY THIS ALBUM FIRST so that you can really appreciate it more, and then go on to buy Follow The Reaper. If it weren't for Follow The Reaper (near masterpiece) then I may like this more. All in all though, its still an excellent performance by one of the most talented bands in extreme metal.
B00005HUYC|5.0|just hear it, and rate it. to me, it is one of the best of John Mclaughlin live.
0783226063|3.0|There is really no way to adapt this complex book to the film, unless you do it as a two week long mini-series.  I think some cowboy wisdom from Bruce R. McConkie is in order here: &quot;Don't drink below the horses.&quot;  If you want the full effect, just read the primary source, the book.<br />This 1984 is the first attempt to transpose this sci-fi classic of classics to the screen.  This adaptation didn't work because it only made sense if you read the book.  I haven't seen the extended version, but think that in this case length would help.<br />THE GOOD: This is not an Edsel; there are redeeming qualities.  First, it is pure eye candy.  The sets and costumes are top notch, and not only that, they are believable.  Second, this version has a better feel for the futuristic royalty, and does a better job of conveying that special sense of pageantry and majesty associated with royalty, which is something we as Americans lost on July 4, 1776.  Third, this is what I am beginning to call a &quot;twofer&quot; or a &quot;threefer&quot; film: some films need to be seen twice or three times to be understood, such as &quot;Unbreakable.&quot;  Did  you understand Hamlet the first time you saw it?  Fourth, with the high budget, you have a high budget cast.  I love seeing Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, Max von Sydow, and yes Sting all in one film! Lastly, this film captures the &quot;spark,&quot; or the essential fell of the book.  Despite being jumbled and over-edited, it captures the essential story of the book, a McGuffen struggle over control of the spice, with every organization against Paul-Muad'Dib.<br />THE BAD:  This film has two main problems, and everything else is a detail.  The first problem is in the adaptation of the book to the screen.  The book Dune is a classic on the level of Lord of the Rings, and has the complexity of the plots within plots within plots, so in the adaptation you will always leave something important out, which leads to the second criticism.  This films second problem was over-editing: too much was taken out, so the story became muddled. Use &quot;Star Wars&quot; as a test case. There are few characters, not much is done in explaining the culture or the environment.  It is basically a &quot;damsel in distress&quot; story with a &quot;David and Goliath&quot; ending.  The focus is on the action of the plot, not on the milieu.  Dune, is more of a milieu story, and not plot driven.  This is what makes Star Wars such a good film, but a bad book, and vica versa.  You can't put a milieu sci-fi story into a film.<br />Some of the other little things are the dramatic whisperings used to represent thought.  I could not make out the lines over the whisperings and the accents.  In a movie, some thoughts are better conveyed by expressions, and not by lines.  The premature birth was also unnecessary, and were not described in the book or on the Sci-Fi channel version.  It contributed nothing to the plot, and was visually repulsive.<br />IMPROVEMENT:  The longer &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; version of this film should be released.  I know Lynch hates it, but give the public what it wants.  He put so much work into the film, why not release the better version?<br />LAST WORD:  I did not like this film when I saw it in 1984 since it was so confusing, but at least it made me &quot;Dune Aware.&quot;  After prodding from my fried Ephraim, I read the book, then re-saw the movies as I read.  A-HA!!  Use this movie as a stepping to back to the bookism.  This films second problem was over-editing: too much was taken out, so the story became muddled.

0688156819|4.0|Tim Burton's style is so recognizable and you'll see it right away in the drawings of poor freak children and their sad tales. It's certainly like a child's book, being short and easy to read, but it's very sad and almost disturbing (yet sometimes funny.) If you feel like your life is bad and sucky, just read about these living birth defects and share their pain.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is one of the only CD's in which I like EVERY SONG!  This whole CD is filled with kick arse music!  They got the beat and the sound to last a long time in the music industry.  I can't wait for their next CD!
B00005NGZX|5.0|Regardless if you consider them metal or hardcore or whatever odd combination of the two you can't deny just how amazing Converge are. Jane Doe strongly holds their reputation up and in my mind is at least an equal to When Forever Comes Crashing if not better. One thing I noticed was that while the music here is as brutal and technical as ever it was a bit catchier I would say and possibly even sticks in your head a little, not something I thought I'd ever be saying about this band. Another thing slightly unusual is the amazing production job they did this time, lightyears beyond the horrible lo-fi rumble on the Agoraphobic Nosebleed split. Of course there are many diehards out there who instantly equate catchiness with &quot;selling out&quot; and their ignorance of what makes a good song sets them short of seeing how incredible the music here really is. Jane Doe will be in my stereo for a while without question.
B00003CWRX|5.0|With today's current crop of movies, it is easy to think that quality films that make you think might have gone the way of the dodo.  However, The Insider is a BIG exception to the rule.  Don't let the long running time or the fact that it may seem like any other A &amp; E documentary discourage you.  This movie is potboiler that keeps you glued to the screen and howling at every the injustice of it all.  <br />One of the greatest compliments for this movie would have to be the fact that I watched it with five of my friends who could care less about current events or journalistic integrity, yet all of them sat through every single minute of it absolutely riveted to the screen.<br />It is kind of discouraging seeing the self-censorship and the &quot;chilling effect&quot; on the media that's taken place since the events of the film. However, the film ends on a high note and is well worth watching if you enjoy great cinema!
B00005JG6R|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic. Lush animation, intense story...All the qualaties a good movie needs. This is truly the god of anime and the only other anime films that stand up to it are Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke. In other words....BUY THIS NOW!!!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Momento is based on an original idea.  The star (Guy Pearce) has a head injury, so he can only remember things before the incident.  He cannot generate new memories.  In the incident where he was hurt, his wife was killed.  He is trying to avenge her death.  The problem is he forgets everything he learns, so he comes up with a system which is somewhat reliable (tatooing himself), but he doesn't know who to trust.  The movie has a good plot and keeps one on the edge of his or her seat.  The movie is basically played in reverse, so we spend the entire movie trying to figure out what happened at the beginning.  Very cool!
B00004WC6J|5.0|How is it that every song I hear by Sylvian strikes a chord in me.  This mix of songs are great not only because it gave me the chance to finally get some more of those hard to find songs but because of hearing the re-makes of the older songs.  I'm a long time fan of Sylvian and have never been disapponted and this is a great one to get.
B00005LMBK|1.0|I love music, especially rock, but when i heard the Goraillaz I ccouldn't believe that that noise was supposed to be music. If I had to pick one band to never have to listen to again it would be the Gorillaz.  The only reason they are getting any stars from me is because I can give them nothing lower.
B000002AGN|5.0|I heard about this cd from a friend of mine. Now that I have it, I can't imagine my life without having heard it. It's just that good.
0788821075|4.0|movie is good.Very excellent acting from Julia Roberts.She is very Sexy in this movie.Richard Gere wasen't bad of a actor.Ohhhhhhhh Julia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(she is hot!!!)VERY recommeded for dating,engaged,and married couples.Very romantic
B00003BDXG|1.0|When director Stone gave viewers Jim Morrison's euphoric, visual perspective of his drunken, drugged journey in &quot;The Doors,&quot; it was a hint of what would later come. In-your-face directing, fast edits and psychedelic direction becomes a bore within the first five minutes. This is as cynical as movies get. The plot: the &quot;media,&quot; news media that is, plays up serial killers Harrelson and Lewis as heros. The performances are great, but Stone's direction of the film is just awful. Impossible to bare for more than 20 minutes. Most critics and viewers agree. Stick to &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; or &quot;Thelma and Louise.&quot;
B000059XYK|1.0|No plot,just you modern day out classed movie.
B00003CXTG|2.0|What a disappointing movie!  I was so looking foward to what I thought would be the exciting blockbuster of 2001. Instead I found Pearl Harbor to be boring, cheezy and very predictable.  First of all it takes FOREVER for any sort of action to get started.  My husband and I were sitting in the theater just waiting for the Japanese to start bombing Pearl Harbor, almost looking foward to it, so we could see something interesting happen on the screen. The romance between the two leads is Laugh out Loud ridiculous.  The dialogue seems to be written by a 14 year old.  I was actually reciting out loud what the characters would say next, it was that predictable.  The story didnt let the audience become at all attached to the characters.  The only reason I give it 2 stars was the great special effects.  Dont waste your time on this dumbed down version of history.  If you want to watch a great movie depicting history see 13 Days or Tora Tora Tora.  Movies like that actually treat the audience like they have a brain.
B00004Z459|5.0|well, to start, i think that hybrid theory is one of the best purchases i've ever made! EVERY song is catchy, has meaningful lyrics, and great riffs. i think it's cool that there are 2 lead singers: one for rap and one for rock. they sound great together. i was sooo tired of the nu-metal era taking over ( though i'm a fan of korn and bizkit) and when i heard hybrid theory, i just smiled and said to myself, &quot; this is rock's providence.&quot; my personnal favorites include &quot; papercut&quot;, &quot;one step closer&quot;, &quot;with you&quot;, &quot;crawling&quot;, and &quot;in the end.&quot; i almost NEVER give any of the albums i've reviewed 5 stars, but this one definately deserved it.
B000021YQV|5.0|This has got to be the release of the year! No one sounds like these guys. The voice of serg is totally different than any other, along with background grunts and growls from daron makes this group a force. As musicians, they are very talented. They incorporate the hard slayer style riffs as well as classical guitar riffs too. If you are looking for something new and hate the \\"pop\\" scene and mtv, buy this. Hopefully they won't go too mainstream. NSYNC SUCKS!
B00005KHJR|4.0|What an odd movie. But very good! I only vaguely recalled it having seen it many years ago (probably on TV). So seeing it now was liking seeing it for the first time. It is a weird hybrid of horror, mystery, thriller and ... well, probably a few other things as well. It definitely has an early 70's look (just look at Christopher Lee!).<br />For those who want the extended version, it's available on the Limited Edition DVD (where both versions are included). Frankly, I'm not so sure the additional minutes make that much difference.
B000021YQV|3.0|The first review of soad's new album? Woohoo!
B000001FT2|5.0|This is Grace Jones's best album to date. On this album contains the hitsongs such as: the mystical song Walking In The Rain, the disco song Pull Up To The Bumper, The nightsong Nightclubbing, The jazz song I've Seen That Face Before, the funny song Feel Up and many more. When Grace first startet to make music was in the middle of the disco years, and her first three albums was also disco album's, ( 1977: Portfolio ) - ( 1978: Fame ) - ( 1979: Muse ). But in 1980 Grace switch her stile to Reggae Dance music and she got her international braktrough in 1981 whit NIGHTCLUBBING. So buy this album coz U will not find a better Grace Jones album.
B000002WCJ|5.0|Who can rightfully debate this is one of the finest power metal albums ever made? A fantastic and underrated offering from Germany's Helloween. I agree with (most) of the others that this album bests part I. Whether or not you buy into Helloween's over-the-top histrionics depends on how much your tolerance for more progressive Iron Maiden (think _7th Son of a 7th Son_). Helloween is very similar to Maiden in many ways, including the magnificent high pipes of Michael Kiske and the dual guitar attack of Kai Hansen and Michael Weikath. They are more thrash-y than Maiden (thank god they don't try to constantly ape the infamous Maiden gallop beat most of the time). And as the other reviewer stated, there is cheese. Cheese GALORE. Thats part of the point though, I think, especially when you look at songs like the satirical &quot;Dr. Stein&quot; (which has a LOT more going on lyrically than meets the eye) and &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; with its madcap accordion swatches, are both absolutely hilarious. EMBRACE THE CHEESE. You have to keep that in mind with the more ridiculous and deliberately anthemic songs, like &quot;We Got The Right&quot; or &quot;Eagle Fly Free&quot;, which will either make you want to stand on top of a mountain with an American flag and shout to heaven, or cringe horribly at the sheer magnitude of their pomposity. On a whole its a lot more fun and entertaining than most of the bands they are compared to. For more serious fantasy-oriented headbanging, check out the fantastic &quot;I Want Out&quot; (IMHO their finest moment). The epic &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys&quot; drags a little, I think, but its interesting compositionally and ends with a nice touch of acoustics to fade out the album.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've heard in years. It is one of the few that grows on you and the more you listen the more you want to hear. Shiver and Yellow are great but Trouble has to be my favorite. I find myself playing this CD over and over.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I first saw her sing her single, Video, on the Oprah Winfrey show and immediately I knew I had to get this CD.  If you haven't heard that single it's worth the price of the entire CD!<BR>However, the rest of the songs are equally wonderful.  Her voice is deep and full of soul and the songs are easy to relate to.  So far it's a winner for me.
0316779237|5.0|I enjoyed this immensely and have given it as a gift to a couple of my friends because it makes a great read anytime of year.  I think it's better to read it when it's not the holiday season because you appreciate it more when you aren't immersed in your own brand of holiday funk.  Thumbs way up.
B000002L7R|5.0|This awesome follow-up 2 &quot;Purple Rain&quot; (and kooool prelude 2 &quot;Parade&quot;) is just what was needed 2 fill the needs of any Prince fan!!! From beginning 2 end, there is a 1derful flow of emotions and color! N hindsight, this is a crucial step N the career of Prince and HIS artists (the Revolution and the upcoming NPG). It is 2 die 4.
0671024256|4.0|ON WRITING reveals what every Stephen King fan wants to know--where he grew up, when he began writing, why his writing is so effective, and how he survived a nearly fatal vanaccident to resume his writing career. The brief autobiography is wonderful, but theinstruction on the craft of writing is outstanding. That section can stand alone as beingextremely helpful for an aspiring writer. Blending his unique style of humor and language,he explains how techniques such as honesty, action rather than adverbs, and believabledialogue contribute to good fiction. The English teacher in the author shines through! Sometimes surprising, but thoroughly readable, memorable, and instructive, ON WRITING is a small book but a large delight.
6304795254|5.0|What is a &quot;Propaganda Film?&quot;  And what does it mean<BR>to boldly proclaim in an opening credit that this is<BR>a &quot;Propaganda Film?&quot;  What is the Propaganda...what is<BR>the message?  Is the message open and overt?  Or is the<BR>message hidden and covert?  <br />  And since so many films have messages and agendas<BR>and NEVER proclaim that fact but set about to influence<BR>attitudes and values, anyway...it's rather refreshing,<BR>if not startling, to see a film which tells you up<BR>front that it is &quot;up to something&quot; but then leaves it<BR>to you to figure out what it is up to.<br />   &quot;It is frustrating to me if you don't pay<BR>attention.&quot;<br />   The lighting, clarity of imagery, and whole<BR>atmosphere of this film are rich in color and<BR>sharpness...and tone.  The lighting and camera<BR>angles...and quality of the image in many scenes<BR>are pure Kubrick...the outer hall in the building<BR>where CRS is located is &quot;2001&quot; style...but the bar<BR>in Nicholas' club is right out of &quot;The Shining.&quot;<br />The use of sound is significant and interlocking<BR>with the visual imagery.  When Nicholas sets out<BR>his birthday &quot;supper&quot; from the oven where Ilsa<BR>has left it...a sandwich, some fries, a chocolate<BR>cupcake with one small candle on it [how sad...<BR>how alone he is...]and he puts the wine glass<BR>down on the tray...the sound reminded me of<BR>the clinking of the glass by Dave Bowman in the<BR>&quot;hotel room&quot; at the end of &quot;2001&quot; just before he<BR>dies...and is reborn...as the Star Child.<br />      &quot;What does it profit a man if he gain the whole<BR>world -- and yet loses his soul?&quot;<br />    &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you...unless one is<BR>born again...&quot;     Does Nicholas die symbolically<BR>in this film?  Is he not even put in a casket?<BR>Is he reborn?  Is he transformed?  Is he dead to<BR>the old self...the old life...that was him?  Does<BR>it have the power to reclaim him with its illusions<BR>and lures?<br />   &quot;No one has expressed an opinion about how it will <BR>affect the pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton.&quot;<br />   &quot;What does that matter to a bloated fat-cat<BR>millionaire like you?&quot;<br />   And what is the t.v. commentator [Daniel Schorr]<BR>talking about...he is talking about the economy...<BR>and how some companies don't want to give health<BR>insurance to their employees...and how 59% of the<BR>people believe that they will lose their jobs<BR>in the next 5 to 7 years.  And what do we read in<BR>our nightly newspapers...or hear on t.v. ...if<BR>it is not mostly economic news and how the market<BR>is doing...and only a brief passing note that<BR>some company may have projected that it will not<BR>meet its earnings during the next quarter so<BR>it is going to lay off 5,000 people worldwide<BR>to cut costs.  But do we hear anything of those<BR>5,000 people and what their fate is after they<BR>lose their jobs...what devastation or disruption<BR>it is to their lives?  Or do we just get<BR>interview after interview with CEO's and<BR>money managers trying to tell everyone how to<BR>be successful and get rich?<br />  Part of the illusion of this film is if you get<BR>caught up (particularly in the first viewing) in<BR>trying to make sense of the game...and trying to <BR>figure out who is doing these things...and how<BR>they are capable of pulling it all off so<BR>&quot;perfectly&quot; (as one reviewer commented) -- only<BR>God could know if Nicholas would step the right<BR>way or not...or jump the right distance or not.<BR>Perhaps the answer is that the game is not<BR>being administered by any human agents...but<br />rather is an allegory for life itself...no<BR>one has life, in all of its aspects, under<BR>control either...we might like to think that<BR>we do, like Nicholas...and some of the reviewers<BR>who react so strongly and negatively to the film<BR>here.  Does the film disturb their own illusions<BR>that they have life under control...and that life<BR>could not be a threat to them either?  We have<BR>programmed illusions of safety and &quot;meaning&quot; and<BR>&quot;purpose&quot; for life...most of them very worldly<BR>and secular...but what happens when life starts<BR>going out of control?  When Nicholas returns to<BR>his house and finds it vandalized...and that loud<BR>music of Jefferson Airplane singing about Alice<BR>[in Wonderland] ...or perhaps we should think of<BR>the &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;...what if that harmless<BR>children's story full of violence and monsters<BR>and a supposed Wizard who &quot;has everything under<BR>control&quot; is also a hidden allegory...what if the<BR>Wizard is supposed to be a hidden stand-in for<br />God...and what if there is no real Wizard behind<BR>the curtain?<br />   The problem comes here, of course, in that the<BR>messengers (the writers, directors, and producers<BR>of this film) suffer the taint of the message...<BR>for they are part of the system too.  They are<BR>making money, too.  Do they salve their consciences<BR>by believing that they are doing a &quot;good work&quot; for<BR>the salvation of their fellow man?<br />    And what of the ending of this film?  Does<BR>Nicholas survive?  Is the ending also a deception<BR>and an illusion?...what if Nicholas actually dies<BR>in the fall...and the rest is an &quot;after life&quot; ...<BR>or &quot;in flight&quot; fantasy...perhaps like &quot;Vertigo&quot;...<BR>did the detective really survive the fall from<BR>the building at the start of that film...or is<BR>everything after that a &quot;death dream?&quot;  What if<BR>the transition between life...and death...is<BR>a transition to a different plane of existence<BR>with no knowledge that one has actually died...<BR>but one is simply moving into another illusion<BR>of reality to replace the one that one has just<BR>left?  Where does the soul go...when the body<BR>dies?  These are not Christian ideas...but they<BR>are certainly worth KNOWING about...<BR>  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
6303481272|5.0|This was the video that got me into anime. Needless to say if you've seen this title, I was hooked. This is one of the best FILMS ever made. A classic and extremely violent tale of feudal Japan following the lives of Jubei the ninja and Kagero, a female assasin he rescues whose mere touch is fatal. The action rarely slows for more than a moment with one interesting and unique character after another helping to tell the well conceived and engrossing story. Purchase this item. I dare you. Becus after you see this, anime is ur life man!
0446310786|5.0|&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a wonderful book exploring issues of southern american life. It is shown through the perspective of the young girl, Scout and depicts the lives of her, her brother Jem and father Atticus over a three year period. Throughout this time we learn of the narrow minded community of Maycomb and the silent neighbour to the Finch's- Boo Radley who has been socially persecuted because fo his individuality. This book really comes down to stereotyping and the judgmental ways of small towns struggling to deal with the big issues. Scout has always been told that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, as they<BR>only provide beautiful music, and do not attack. This motto is strongly applied throughout many storylines within this book. The most prominent being of the black man, Tom Robinson, who is trialled for raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell, the daughter of the local disorderly drunk. Atticus is called to represent Tom, and although a lost cause to set him free, tries to the best of his abilities and sticks up for what he believes in- even though being the is the sole person in the town that thinks so.The messages Harper Lee conveys throughout this trial and the story are fundamental issues that all must deal with throught the spiralling journey of life. As Atticus says to Scout- you can only come to understand a person when you climb inside their skin and walk around in their shoes. A poignant, masterful text that should be read by all.
B00005NW02|5.0|Buy this album now. It is so incredibly rich sounding...like eating pure butter but in convenient music form. Smooth, mellow, strange, quirky, and at times incredibly hard...buy it now.
6304383177|5.0|Hepburn and Grant are at the peak of their abilities in this classic -- a zany rich girl, a zoologist, a dinosaur, and a missing leopard.  This is probabaly my favorite Hepburn movie (OK, maybe the Lion in Winter), and the dialogue is fast, witty, and intelligent.  An excellent example of movie making at its best.
0790729644|5.0|This is one of Clint's best movies. I think it ranks right up there with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and Dirty Harry. I loved the characters especially Hackman's. The DVD is of very good quality.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop Dogg is the king of gangsta-rap, hands down. Get this album
B000021YQV|4.0|I'll admit. I was a bit skeptical about System of A Down's sophmore album Toxic City at first. Thinking there is no way s.o.a.d. could top their self titled debut. HOWEVER! its amazing how this great band captured that energizing feeling yet again in Toxic City. I have yet to purchase this cd yet due to lack of money.... but that is the ONLY reason. My brother on the other hand has already bought it, and so Ive listened to it a few times, it is simply remarkable and very commendable that Shavo, Serj, Darren and John have given us another tremendous album to mosh and headbang to! If you havent already, BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00003CXE6|2.0|The only things that saved this movie from mediocrity were the acting qualities of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix as well as some of the excellent editing achieved in some of its scenes -- particularly the initial battle scenese with the Goths and in some of the gladiator scenes when in Rome. Otherwise a historically inaccurate depiction with set designs resembling Ceasars in Las Vegas than Rome in the distant past.
B00004R99I|3.0|No Disney movie has ever been awaited with such anticipation as was Pocahontas. After the series of early '90's masterpieces--The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King (which broke both box office and video records) everyone expected the trend to continue. I was wary before the fact that this one might be a letdown, and indeed it was. It didn't live up to the anticipation or the pre-release screening. The &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; song was good enough to tantalize, but the rest of the score and songs are far from Alan Menken's best (seen in Mermaid and Beast).<BR>Simply put, this movie was a disappointment after the Great Four. It isn't all bad by any means. I appreciate its good points, especially the fact that it didn't give us a predictable white=bad/all things Native American=good scenario and showed us the Indians' prejudices as well as those of the whites. That being said, however, the movie's heart-on-sleeve political correctness becomes very stifling indeed to the escapist joy we expect from even the most serious Disney animated stories. Aladdin proved that Disney animation can be both fun and appealing to adults at the same time. Pocahontas is seriously deficient in the fun factor.<BR>It really was the beginning of the downturn in the latter half of the decade for Disney. None of the other films following it come close to the quality of the Great Four, even though &quot;Hunchback&quot; is undeniably powerful. Now, with the disturbing trend away from musicals seen in &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; (which began as early as &quot;Tarzan&quot;), it's hard to believe that Disney can catch the early '90's magic again. Unfortunately, Pocahontas is clearly the beginning of a decline.
B000002INR|3.0|At first I didn't really care for Skid Row at first.I bought this album just to listen to &quot;I remember you&quot; and I just fell in love with this album.I had a headache the first time I heard this album because it's so hard but I didn't want to put it down.Great Album.
0440224764|5.0|Like always, Grisham captivates us with his masterful story telling.  The main Character is a lawyer, as usuall for Grisham, that fakes his own death, steals money from his firm and a client, and gets caught by a sleezy Private I.  You will keep guessing in this great story.
B0000584V3|5.0|This is bar none the best album I've purchased in a very long time.  The variety of the songs is completely perfect, mixing the hard core thrash metal with the accoustic's as only Opeth can do.<br />I have yet to partake of a band with the talent Opeth exibits.<br />If you buy no other album, buy this one.
B00000J7S8|1.0|After reading all these glorious reviews, I'm still stumped by the responses. The only thing I liked about this was the music. Her voice is awful, and she sings off key. She is a mediocre singer at best, with skills but no real talent, and probably would have stayed playing small town piano bars had it not been for her model good looks....
B000021YQV|5.0|I had high hopes for this album and surprisingly System of a Downs sophmore release, &quot;Toxicity,&quot; doesn't disappoint.  I have been a fan of SoaD since their self-titled album.  Although I loved that album there were some songs I just didn't care for and I found myself skipping 2 or so songs everytime I listened to it.  This is not the case with &quot;Toxicity.&quot;  Every song is awesome.  From lead singer Serj Tankian's rants about the U.S. prison system to the get up and dance song &quot;Bounce,&quot; in which he sings about a pogo stick.  It's interesting the way Serj's voice and guitarist Daron Malakians voice seem to fit together in harmony.  It just sounds so perfect.  If you like System of a Down then your going to love this album.  If you've never heard System of a Down then chances are you'll still love this album.  Pick this one up before you pick up Slipknot's &quot;Iowa,&quot; you won't regret it!
B000002P5W|5.0|Released the same year as their debut, AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE is perhaps just as good as the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first record, ARE YOU EXPERIENCED. This time around, though, Jimi and his bandmates are verging into a more experimental stage, a stage that would be best demonstrated on the Experience's next record, ELECTRIC LADYLAND. ARE YOU EXPERIENCED meant power, grit, speed and heavy distortion. But AXIS, however, starts to use studio technology as a part of their music. Throughout this album, there's some studio gimmicktry scattered around here and there. <br />All the tracks have a strong point to them. Even &quot;EXP,&quot; a highly experimental tune which begins with Mitch Mitchell interviewing an alien life expert by the name of Paul Carousoe (Jimi), has some value to it. With that stuck in the front, we hear some classic Hendrix songs all the way through. &quot;One Rainy Wish&quot; demonstrates a great use of the wah-wah pedal, while the heavy guitar in &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot; preludes heavy metal by nearly a decade. Another element which could be fascinating is the way that Jimi talks the lyrics very briskly in &quot;Castles Made of Sand.&quot; Without exception, this may be the first rap song ever. But AXIS's highlight may well be the ballad-like masterpiece &quot;Little Wing,&quot; with its memorable guitar riffs and oh yes, the triangle. The supremely melodic and catchy &quot;You Got Me Floatin'&quot; is also among AXIS's best cuts. More interesting is the dated but fascinating &quot;She's So Fine,&quot; which may be the only released recording in the Hendrix catalog in which anyone but Jimi sings (Noel does). &quot;Ain't No Telling&quot; stands out, too. The only unemarkable song on the entire album may be &quot;If 6 Was 9,&quot; in which they overload on studio gimmicks.<br />If ARE YOU EXPERIENCED was the most famous and best overall quality Henrix Experience record, then AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE may be the most enjoyable. The material was strongenough on here to make it a classic, although not the classic some critics paint it to be. If I was to recommend how to make a Hendrix collection, start with ARE YOU EXPERIENCED and work your way chronologically, then transpose BAND OF GYPSYS and FIRST RAYS OF THE NEW RISING SUN. Then spend your money on compilations.

B00003CXV4|1.0|What's wrong with Hollywood? Just like the pure idea alone of Silence of the Limbs would amaze you well enough, the idea of this movie will, oppositely, sicken you all the way. Remember The Watcher (badly enough in its own rights), would be a classic comparing with this one.<BR>I am still confused why good actors like these two would take on a project like this. After two hours of viewing, not only careful consideration of choosing future title is needed, but also watching some boxing just to drive away the disgust this movie left.
B000008GAC|5.0|While Matthew already wrote an excellent review I would still like to add my own thoughts on this album.<BR>This album contains obvious hits such as Sweet Child O' Mine and Paradise City, but I assure you, it is the rest of the songs you'll end up listnening to again and again. One of the best die hard song ever written, &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;, gets better every time you listen to it. Also the funk influenced song &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; keeps on rockin'. <BR>In many ways, this is the best hard rock album ever made, and I'm pretty sure it'll go down in history and be remembered as such, for years to come. No other album contains the energy that this one has. You must own it!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I'm not a big fan of gimmick films. The Usual Suspects existed totally for the twist at the end, and honestly I find that cheap and easy.<br />When I first heard about the &quot;backwards&quot; story in memento I was put off. Sounded like another cheap trick to set your film apart....until I started watching it, and realized that it's not a gimmick at all. It's the ONLY way you could really tell the story. They actually managed to make it work, I give them GREAT credit for that. That to me was the greatest achievement. They managed to make the fact that the move is running backwards have a reason.<br />Good Job guys
B00003CXZ4|4.0|There is much good to be said about Memento. The low-key direction is a big plus (no annoying swells in the soundtrack and such) that adds to the tension. The cast, principally Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano &amp; Carrie-Ann Moss, is terrific. And that's just for starters.<br />The best thing about it is the story. You probably know the basics: Leonard Shelby (Pearce) out to avenge wife's murder, has no short term memory, scenes are shown in reverse chronological order. This is a high concept that is done very well. Memento may be one of the cleverest movies ever. Not only are you caught up trying to figure out what's going on, but many of the scenes are surprisingly powerful: Leonard's tatoo-covered body, his attempts to assert that memory is over-reated, one character showing how easy it is to manipulate someone with his condition. And &quot;Do not believe his lies&quot; can take its place along with &quot;Rollo Tomassi&quot; and &quot;Who is Keyser Soze?&quot; in the neo-film noir hall of fame.<br />A few gripes: the big twist at the end, while a good one, didn't strike me as quite as original as the rest of the movie. (Don't worry, no spoilers; but I can think of another flick that had a rather similar twist at the end.) A story this complex probably leaves a few goofs in continuity, though it takes some careful observation to spot them. And duh! How on earth did whoever produced this DVD avoid the most obvious feature: a version with the scenes in chronological order? What were they thinking?<br />That said, this is a great movie with mondo potential (demand, almost) for multiple viewings. Watch carefully. Do not believe the lies...
B00003CXZ4|3.0|The movie itself gets 5 stars, but the DVD gets only 1.<BR>To not put a director and cast commentary on this DVD is a crime!<BR>This movie craves for it!
B00003CXP1|1.0|Straight off: Ellen Burstyn puts in a wonderful performance.  No one could say otherwise.  And none of the actors let the side down.  (Although I have reservations about the casting.)<br />Requiem is about drugs and how we all take them and how they mess us up and specifically it is about one family, a mother and a son, both addicted to their own drugs and the preservation of their own too glamorous world visions.  Darren A swallows Aristotle's line about tragedy hook line and sinker.  Small flaw, BIG fall (well, ...how many kids do [drugs]? how many moms pop valium? and survive without ruin, disaster, shame).  Loss of limb, loss of sanity, loss of life are all in the goody bag here and no one goes home without picking one out.<br />Now drugs CAN do horrible things to people.  Obviously.  And movies like \\"Drug Store Cowboy\\", or even \\"Trainspotting\\", which on the face of it are far more fantastic (ie unreal) handle their subject with a greater realism and they treat their audience like grown ups who can take a little smooth with their rough without getting the wrong idea.<br />But Requiem is just a fable at heart; it's about Beautiful people (leto and his girlfriend) destroying themselves.  It puts the audience through [agony], close up scenes of injections, of diseased wounds, of mad, distressed, old women, and for what?  To tell us that drugs kill pretty people too?  Yes, not only that, but just because you're a pensioner your not off the hook because if you start a habit then you've got it coming too.  Come on.  It's not enough.  And it's absurd that we should go to a movie theatre and be emotionally beaten up and made to feel reverential as if we were watching eye witness testimony of the horrors of the Trenches, D-Day, or Vietnam and leave with a little nifty camera work and an oh-so-subliminal message: \\"Kids! Don't do drugs.\\"<br />But it's worse than that. Because at the same time that Darren A. forces us to take his sordid little world seriously he doesn't.  he uses these pretty boy and pretty girl actors and he uses techno camera work and all manner of slick fancy stuff.  And he uses it all very obviously.  And that's dealing in double standards.  And if it is trivial, and I maintain it is, then scenes like the disgusting sexual self-abasement of Leto's girlfriend by a pimp-dealer and his party guests are actually offensive.  I don't know why more people don't think so.
0441172717|4.0|Dune is one of the most popular science fiction novels, and with good reason.  If nothing else, it's ambitious; a complex plot draws on elements from ancient and medieval history as well as Islamic culture, blending ecology, politics, messianic religion and mysticism to create a long, sometimes engrossing, sometimes baffling tale of a young superhero who revolutionizes galactic civilization.<br />The novel has several flaws; much of the mysticism is not luminously clear, and much of the dialogue is stilted.  Herbert's style is in the process of maturing here; it's a quirky and distinctive voice, and his writing is generally of high quality, but the pacing is uneven, and many readers will find the book difficult to get into.  (I started it seven times over a period of several years before it finally caught on for me; and Herbert himself admitted the book was not an easy start.)<br />With so many details involved in the story, it's not surprising that there are questions and plot holes.  Some readers may find the characters two-dimensional, and Paul Atreides, the hero, remains remote.  Still, Herbert deserves credit for tackling so many issues in the context of a science fiction adventure, and also for constructing what's basically a Van Vogt-style superman story whose central character is opaque, rather than the straight-up-and-down hero a more simplistic writer might have created.<br />Many of Herbert's ideas don't fit comfortably into a single novel, even one of this length; I found that I came to enjoy both his writing style and his ideas as I read further books in the series.<br />This is a worthwhile book that deserves all the attention it's garnered, but many readers should expect to be patient and to make a certain effort to get used to Herbert's approach to storytelling.  The opening chapter is a stunner and immediately grabs your attention, but the book shifts gears after that and takes another fifty pages or so to pick up the pace.  But stick with it --- it's fascinating and rewarding.- it's fascinating and rewarding.
B000001FS3|2.0|An overrated adult/contemporary schlock-fest pretending to be alternative, the Joshua Tree is as one-dimensional as the rest of U2's catalogue. I have never found Bono a particularly soulful singer, and his lyrics are like the scribblings of a 10th grader who just learned to rhyme. Put me in prison and force me to hear this stuff, I would lose my mind. There was better music than this in 1987 (try Pixies). (Interestingly, this was the same year REM sold out with Document). Bono is not the Bob Dylan of his generation, nor even any sort of a poet at all.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Yep. The Best CD anythng can buy. Britney 's outdone herself producng this CD. Featurng great tracs. Oops! Stronger Lucky Dont Let Me Be The Last to Know and more. BUY IT! <BR>Remember... You heard it here from Britney's biggest fan right here.     ~Ashley
B000001F3C|5.0|War is a sensational album that has already become a classic in the annals of rock music. There's not a bad cut on this album and I highly recommended it to all U2 fans. Here is a summary and an evaluation of each song on this album: <br />· Sunday Bloody Sunday: For all the airplay this song has received over the years, it's still a good song that has something of a timeless quality to it. This is one of U2's signature songs that not only cries for help but also offers hope. Grade: B<BR>· Seconds: An apocalyptic piece that features an evocative rhythm section from Mullen and Clayton. Good vocal by Edge. Grade: B+<BR>· New Year's Day: Another song that has apocalyptic overtones. Features a screeching guitar, driving bass, a razor-sharp acoustic piano and an in-your-face vocal performance from Bono. Great anthem, great song. Grade: A<BR>· Like A Song: Larry Mullen hits the drums with full intensity and Edge's guitar will scorch your speakers on this one. An intense song that features a hard-hitting bass and a passionate vocal performance from Bono. Score: B+ <BR>· Drowning Man: A haunting yet pensive number that uses an electric violin to convey the mood here. Like many of U2's songs, this one includes a passage from Scripture (in this case, Isaiah) to underscore its message. Grade: A<BR>· The Refugee: A political commentary on the plight of a Latin American refugee. Larry Mullen's drum work dominates this piece. Good vocal performance from Bono. Grade: B<BR>· Two Hearts (Beat As One): The second single from this album. Nice guitar work from Edge and Bono's scat-like singing make this one of the more distinctive cuts on the album. Grade: B<BR>· Red Light: One of my favorite cuts on this disc. The combination of background vocal harmonies, solid guitar work from Edge and the hearty sounds of a trumpet makes this one of U2's most atypical songs. Grade: A<BR>· Surrender: Edge dominates this song with his usual guitar prowess. Also features a resounding bass from Adam Clayton and solid drum work from Larry Mullen. Bono's vocals are solid as usual and the background vocals enhance the song's tempo. Note: As I understand it, the Martin Scorsese film, Taxi Driver, was the inspiration for this song. Grade: A+<BR>· &quot;40&quot;: Psalm 40 was the inspiration for this piece. Although conflict and emptiness are the main themes of this album, U2 ends it on a positive note by asserting that there is always hope. Nice acoustic guitar work complemented by a restrained rhythm section. Grade: A
B00004XQP4|5.0|I have all of Green Day's cds and this one is the coolest one. I still love them.  Even with their new sound. I read somewhere that the next Green Day record is going to be alot hardder then warning and when the Green Day greatest hits album comes out buy it but buy it from amazon when they put it out for pre-order.  I hope they do it soon.
B00003CXTG|5.0|A great guy movie/chick-flick. Lots of action and great historical documentation!
B000001E18|5.0|A lot of people didn't like this brand of U2.  But I did.  I'd really rather give it only 4.5 stars, as I still don't think this is their best work, but still very good.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is awesome! The only thing I can compare it to is \\"The Usual Suspects\\", but at the same time it has nothing to do with it. You just have to see it for yourself.
B000001FRY|4.0|This is early, raw U2.  Good stuff.  Production quality isn't up to current standards.  I'd love to hear it redone with current studio production standards, but of course that is just a dream.
B00005A1PR|4.0|How refreshing to listen to this record. India sings with a heart and Soul that takes me back to another time.She reminds me of this record that came out years ago called Womanchild by Bemshi but updated for today. India keeps it real and like Jill Scott, Maceo Parker and Rodney Jones, &quot;Soul Manifesto&quot; cd is keeping the heart and soul in the music! Acoustic Soul is a must buy is you love Soul music. I bet her next record will be even better!
B000001EAQ|4.0|Not that many people liked this CD.  Its not their best, in my opinion.  But I still really like it.
B00000DLUV|5.0|With disco cover bands (like the Boogie Knights in Los Angeles) having a field day in night clubs and a renewed interest in 70's music, perhaps the Bee Gees took notice. This LIVE CD is refreshing to hear because everything is so crisp and \\"high fidelity\\" sounding compared to the old studio recordings. Instrumentally everything sounds better than ever. The only thing that is at times sub-par is Barry's falsetto voice when he sings alone. Maybe it was the Las Vegas weather or maybe his voice just matured. Who knows? Some of his imperfections add character but sometimes I found myself wincing .... Yet miraculously Barry's performance is rescued by absolutely FLAWLESS backup vocals. The harmonies sound absolutely PRO! I give any band 5 stars for making a return 20 + years later. Nobody in the current era seems to be able to write a song like they used to.
B000001F5F|5.0|I've been a U2 fan for a long, long time.  But for some reason, I never got around to picking up this CD until just recently.  I found it a rather pleasant surprise.  Stong live versions of early U2, plus some tracks not available any where else.  Good stuff.
6305627347|5.0|This movie will make christians angry, parents disgusted, and war veterans.. well, laugh! I love it! It's the most sick, offensive, thing ever. It should be banned AND I LOVE IT! I like it that Metallica was doing to song &quot;Hell Isn't Good.&quot; I thought that the Mmkay song was the best. The french kid who hates godis so silly and twisted. These guys are great.
B000001DTM|5.0|This CD rocks.  But I bet you knew that already.
B000002J03|4.0|This album may not be their best, but it should be your 1st pick from them. This album unleased so many bands. Some of them actually play riffs just like them, but dont give 'em credit. This is a good album, but there is some weak stuff. Whole Lotta love is probably the most popular, but it's pretty much the same riff over and over again. Not that it's bad. Oh what a riff that is! What is and What Should Never Be is my favorite, because it's like Nirvana. Quiet verses and loud choruses, then near the end, it kicks you in the teeth. Nice bass work by John Paul Jones, by the way. Lemon Song is superb, but it does rip-off old blues. Oh what the hell, everyone rips off blues, when you think about it. Thank You has the best acoustic guitar solo ever, and it's a nice soothing ballad before the big asskicker comes in. Heartbreaker. Being a guitarist, I love this song, (laughs) because it's got that great improvised (I think it was) solo. Some excellent drum playing by Bonham. Living Loving Maid is pretty much filler. It's the only thing close to a please-make-us-big single that Led Zeppelin did. Ramble On is great, since im a huge Tolkien fan. It's got really good traveling music, especially in the guitar harmonies. You can feel Frodo leaving the Shire in that part, cant you? Next is Moby Dick. Despite the extensive drum playing by John Bonham which is good, i dont really like it. The drums sound too soft. But that's ok, cause the next one is Bring It on Home. Nice harmonica playing from Plant. Plant sings in this rednecky tone in this song, then it gets big in the middle. So, it's good. But not their best. Hope you like it!
B000001FS6|4.0|This is their most uneven work.  But, being double length, there is still plenty of good stuff.  You could throw away half of it, and have left a 5 star CD.
B00003CWL6|4.0|This movie is dark comedy, but I still feel that the acting was over-the-top, especially by Benning.  This film is a warning to us about the breakdown of families consumed by careers and materialism.  That's one of the themes, at least.  I like most of the scenes with the girl Angela, notably her cheerleader-performance with the Spartanians, and then near the end of the film when she is all alone with Lester.  If the performances were less campy, I would have given it five.  The DVD has great sound, but the extras are only average IMO.  My favorite parts of this film are the music (main theme/Angela's CD) and the screenplay.
B000001F3C|5.0|The Joshua Tree is oft considered &quot;THE&quot; U2 CD for all times.  That one's good, but I still think this one surpases it.  In my opinion, if I could only have one U2 CD, this would be it.
156895929X|5.0|This was the first Linda Howard book I read, and so far the best! You ccan't help but like Janie and learn to like Sam. This book made me laugh like crazy, cry, and feel their losses and triumphs. Luna, Marci, and T.J. also become close friends, and you want justice done to the killer. Strangely enough, you are sympathetic to the murderer. Her best book out of all I've read!<BR> This is a murder mystery that starts when T.J.,Marci, Luna, and Janie make up a list of requirements for Mr. Perfect. When they are being stalked and killed because of it, you want to see the murderer get caught. Well-written and very intriging. I strongly recommend!
B000001FS3|4.0|This is of course a great CD. But there are a couple of U2 CD's I like better. This is often considered &quot;THE&quot; U2 CD of all times, and I disagree. If I had to pick &quot;THE&quot; U2 CD of all times, I'd pick War.
B000000OQF|5.0|Not much can be added to the myriad of 5-star reviews. This album remains excellent, and it is with a silent smile that I see it in the bargain bins these days.<br />One wonders where the new mega-albums are to appear from? For those who believe that only one category of music has value, fail to see the point. Music must stand for something, and the boys from GNR provided this on a plate with this explosive first album. There are tracks on the two UYI albums which are better in my opinion (more musically accomplished), but tracks 6 and 9 (I don't think that I need to name them) allow those of us who are over 25 to return to a simpler period of our lives. Let's face it, everybody knows them... and whatever anyone may say, they secretly like these songs... I observed the reaction to play listings during the nightclub sessions at university.<br />Definitely one of my 10 desert island discs.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I just finished watching this movie and I'm trying to figure out what the other reviewers saw that I missed! It was a waste of money as far as I'm concerned! The movie is totaly backwards, just when I was hoping I would get what was really going on , the credit's started rolling. I sat in my seat thinking, ok now what was that all about, now I know,a real waste of time and money. Maybe the movie was to deep for me?<BR>If you want to see this movie, rent it, don't buy it like I did and wish you had your money back!
0780020685|5.0|This is one of Kurosawa's greatest masterpiece. This movie even set the path for some of the best classic western films. It was artisticlly directed with strong characters and a strong story line. If you're expecting a kung fu flick with lots of blood and no plot but revenge, then don't watch this. Seven Samurai is like a great book put on film. The DVD has a commentary for indepth site on the story, the characters, the director, and the actors. I definitely recommend this DVD to any film enthusiast.
0805062971|5.0|If you liked the movie, You'll love the book.  There is so much more in the book that the movie left out, you'll enjoy comparing the two.
6305014140|5.0|This anime is action packed with flying samurai, ninjas, demons,and creatures of the night. There's a simple story to follow with the right amount of drama and romance(almost none). This DVD is great for any Martial Arts or Anime fans.
B00005K3O4|4.0|I thought that this movie was pretty darn good. The only part of the movie that is ridiculously hideous is the opening theme song, and that's why I give the movie a 4. Now all we need on DVD for 80's horror movies that have been out of print for a long time are, &quot;The Return Of The Living Dead&quot;, and, &quot;Return Of The Living Dead Part 2&quot;.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Although I haven't heard Pablo Honey or The Bends except from excerpts, no Radiohead album is the same as another.  OK Computer is a great album to listen to and is incredibly entertaining.  Kid A is different from anything I've ever heard, it's electronic, but it isn't annoyingly over beated.  Amnesiac is more of a blend of the two.  Amnesiac would seem to be a good album to have released before Kid A, sort of like a translation album.  OKC has quick straight delivery of lyrics.  Kid A and Amnesiac are muddled, slow, and calming.  Both styles do the job of entertainment and a sort of enlightenment.  If you are looking for an album that will keep you listening, buy OKC.  If you want an album that is not an MTV favorite and is entirely different, get Kid A.  If you want something that is inspiring and calming, get Amnesiac.  Radiohead is the best modern band.  Enjoy them.
B000005ZGZ|5.0|End Hits is one of the greatest albums ever produced, period. Never have i listened so much to a CD and never tired of it, but rather rejoiced everytime it repeated. This CD adjusts to my mood when i need it. If i'm happy, it makes me feel free and blissful. If i'm sad, it makes me feel alone and dismal. I admit, i didn't get into most of Fugazi's earlier stuff. I loved &quot;Repeater&quot; but i thought &quot;In On the Kill Taker&quot; and &quot;Red Medicine&quot; were nearly as good as people say - they do, however, have some of fugazi greatest songs, surrounded by some not so great. But END HITS is just a completely evolved creation. Ian and Guy are amazing poets in my opinion, yet on END HITS, some songs evade my comprehension completely, such as &quot;Caustic Acrostic.&quot; But the music often out preforms the lyrics in this CD, which is a first for Fugazi. Buy it, you'll regret it if you don't.
0380002930|5.0|This book is amazing for most age, but as the negative reviews show, it's not for everyone.<br />It's a long book. You need to have some sort of attention span to read it. Which is why so many high school students dislike it when forced to read it. <br />It's &quot;about&quot; rabbits. They talk. If you can't get over that, skip this book. There are made up words too. Oh the horror. It is in part a fantasy. If that genre repulses you, skip this book.<br />That's part of the reason so many people loved this book as young kids. If you know a child who's not too easily scared (because some of the book is dark) they'll love it for the pure fantasy elements of it, though they might need it read to them if they're really young.<br />It's great on so many other levels too. I first read it the summer before freshmen year (yes, it was required for school). And each time I've read it since I have gotten more out of it. It's a moving story, a fanciful adventure, an allegorical tale, and more, all in one.
0425098478|3.0|The One Minute Manager is one of those books that stands even on grocery store shelves, which indicates to me not only that it is a best-seller but also that it is for people with short attention spans who crave repetition. In fact, the One Minute Manager is one of those books that is easy about which to generalize without even reading it first. You, like me, might be wrong about your pre-conceived notions about it. But it is nearly inevitable to make judgments about the book before reading it. While the content turns out to be more useful and less dismissive than I first feared it might, a book of this style and (considerable lack of) length really lends validation and credibility to a managerial style suited for those without real leadership skills-the brush off, the rude and direct kiss off or needless and personal criticism. Sure, when time is limited we may not have the time to be sensitive and to speak deliberately in soft metaphors that cushion the real and blunt intent of our words. However, tact is always appropriate, but this book somehow excuses those who choose to communicate in a non-productive but always critical fashion, even though the book's content by no means condones such tactics. The book's style might lead you to dismiss it as I originally did. It offers quick, keen, simplistic distillations, a McDonaldization fast food approach, if you will, to dealing with people. Never having managed people, I always had the impression that I have been managed by people who absorb the brief and oversimplified &quot;methods&quot; espoused here. Read the eminent qualifications of the writers (developers of the &quot;one minute system&quot;) and you will be convinced that they definitely discovered the essence of this fast food managerial style. Maybe Blanchard and Johnson have perfected it, but in true self-help &quot;hackery&quot; those who read the book will selectively choose bits and pieces of the philosophy to apply to their own stylistics or, worse yet,will adopt the book's tenets with almost Biblical reverence and live all facets of life according to the One Minute Gospel. This sort of book is theoretically dangerous if misapplied because it very easily and summarily reduces people, problems and communication to ONE MINUTE. It reeks of shallowness and erases the human face of management (much like Boeing executives who recently announced that they will leave Seattle. Most likely so they will not have to face the employees when the time comes to fire them). Strangely the simplicity of the book is deceiving. Some people who employ these theories fail to remember the very first and overriding principle the book names, &quot;The One Minute Manager's symbol-a one minute readout from the face of a modern digital watch-is intended to remind each of us to take a minute out of our day to look into the faces of the people we manage. And to realize that they are our most important resources.&quot; This book encourages managers to discover &quot;how people produce valuable results and feel good about themselves&quot;, but the &quot;knowledge&quot; most people gain from this book in reading it is seldom applied this way. For example, the book emphasizes giving constructive criticism... letting an employee know immediately when s/he has done something good or when s/he has done something wrong and why. A close friend's manager, as an example of a horror story of misapplied principles, read an employee's write-up of something and wrote an expletive in LARGE, red letters across the text of the write-up but failed to provide any insight as to why he wrote that or why he felt it necessary to belittle the work of his employee. He might ask himself the question that the book asks, &quot;How on earth can I get results if it's not through people? I care about people AND results. They go hand in hand.&quot; It is only natural and logical that if you belittle, ridicule, or mistreat your employees, they will not respect you as their manager, will not be as willing to give their best and will certainly be less productive as a result. &quot;Productivity is both quantity and quality.&quot; In the One Minute Management philosophy there are three simple precepts which the One Minute Manager establishes with his employees: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praisings, and One Minute Reprimands. These are all very logical steps-goal setting makes sure that employees understand perfectly what their duties are, what is expected of them and that there are no surprises. Many times in real life managers assume employees know exactly what to do without sitting down with them and concisely defining the goals. (A problem exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening). Sadly, a common description of a misguided manager sounds a lot like managers I have encountered, including those who have read this book. They focus on the negative and do not make their expectations clear. Then they &quot;zap&quot; the employee at a performance review to make themselves look good or like they are administering discipline, an approach completely full of vanity and professional insecurity. It also leads to unhappy and fearful employees and benefits no one. One Minute Praising is all about the manager catching the employee doing something right and giving her/him immediate feedback. This is seen as a motivator, with constructive progress reports, focused on the positive. Lastly, the one minute reprimands are honest, direct, specific &quot;what's wrong with what you did and why&quot; moments. These moments are handled with sensitivity and define only wrong behavior not personal attacks on an individual. The book, my friends, is basically common sense. Plain and simple. &quot;People are not pigeons. People are more complicated. They are aware, they think for themselves, and they certainly don't want to be manipulated by another person. Remember that and respect that. It is a keyto good management.&quot; This is one statement I can take away from this book, feeling like the 80 or so pages were worthwhile. Now if only I could plaster that statement across the foreheads of the bad managers throughout the world.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Wow.  This is without a doubt Pearl Jam's most fabulous CD that they've put out so far.  From the hushed sounds of Sometimes to the closing Around the Bend, this CD could never get old.  I'm so glad that Ed and co. decided to be themselves and not conform to the &quot;jeremy fans.&quot;  This is Pearl Jam at is finest.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|While this album has a pretentiously long title, Fiona Apple's sophomore offering is anything but pretentious. Her lyrics are precise, painful (although not nearly as painful as in her brilliant debut, Tidal) and achingly honest. Apple has a gift for putting her pain into words in songs that are somehow intelligent, cathartic and positively addictive. Her voice is smoky, husky, soaring over what are sometimes catchy tunes and idiosyncratic lyrics. You listen to the music and want to think, \\"What a psycho.\\" She displays her wounds lyrically more starkly and painfully than anyone would really want to hear. Apple, though, is distant, smart. She makes you fascinated, and you want to know more. She does not have quite the draw of an Alanis Morissette \\"You Oughta Know\\" on her hands on this album or her debut, but Fiona Apple doesn't need a gimmick or flash in the pan because she has depth, a real story to tell, a gift for writing captivating music and lyrics, and credibility as an artist.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Have you ever felt there should be music in the world that is somehow otherworldly? Something that you yourself could never imagine but which would soothe your soul and make your everyday concerns dissipate in the sound? Hard as it may be to believe, a few guys from Iceland have made your dreams come true with this album. It was released in its native Iceland two years earlier than in the States, but it was worth the wait for those Stateside. I first heard this CD in 1999 in someone's living room in Akureyri, Iceland, and I instantly felt transported, ran to the store and bought several copies of the album and promptly distributed it to my friends in other places. The music envelops you in a way that changes your entire outlook and transports you to another place. Problem is, it is an unidentifiable place and time because you have never really heard anything like this. Mellow, atmospheric, Sigur Rs will feed your mood. Granted, the vocals take some getting used to, particularly on the single \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\", but for those who appreciate indie music, new sounds and experimentation, this is a beautiful album.
B0000025JT|5.0|Yeah, this is her best selling album but most of all is her best album in  pop music terms. The Broadway Album , the albums of the 60s, the latest recordings...all that is great too, but if you want her best POP album Guilty is the answer. All the songs are worthy, the vocals are really something oustanding, her voice was better than ever in her musical carreer....This was my first Barbra album and I fell in love with her very soon. Make it like a memory became finally my personal favourite in this album, but I really think all the songs are gems. Love this. Truly something magic and very special
0385474547|3.0|I have read Things Fall Apart at three different times in my life, and I still don't love it. I probably never will love it, but I can appreciate and admire it for the fact that Achebe captures something of the essence and non-linear quality of living in an oral/verbal culture rather than one that is more focused on reading and writing. The stories of oral traditions are passed on by word of mouth and therefore change slightly with retelling. The stories essentially embody the same characteristics as the original story, but different twists certainly must come into play depending on the teller because memory and experience can also influence how one tells a story.
B000001Y42|4.0|This Limp Bizkit album is okay, but not really. I give it 4 stars because of it's yellin' and screamin'. It's a PAAIINN to everyones EARS E-A-R-S Fred. My fave song is Counterfeit.
B000002BE9|5.0|I guess I probably say that because I got it in Fall. Last Fall, really. And I've played it religiously ever since. P>I first heard NEVER IS A PROMISE whilst sitting in the library with my friend. This was before I got it, really, and it was her CD. I was at first struck by the sheer beauty of the openingstrings. I knew I liked it. And I just skipped over it. And I remember going outside with her and sitting in the gazeebo across the street. It was rainy, in October I think. It was really chilly but my kinda weather: gorgeous. I listened to it and realized it paralleled my \\"relationship\\" with a guy I really had strong feelings for. It was very pretty and she used her voice so soaringly.<br />The song, to this day, is my faovrite and makes me cry almost everytime. To get the full effect for youself, listen to it while walking home on a chilly, drizzly autumn day. Everything will change.<br />I love every song on this CD and when it's over, you feel like you've been on a wonderful ride. I'm flattered Fiona offered us a seat.
B00000AFGM|4.0|I'd read reviews of this album, too glam, etc.  Since I really liked Antichrist Superstar I put off buying this CD.  Too bad, I could have been enjoying some of these tracks all along, especially User Friendly and The Dope Show.  If you like Manson, this may not be your favorite CD but maybe it won't disappoint.
B00005614N|5.0|Duke is wonderfully understated on this CD and Louis Armstrong steals the show by toning down his Dixie-land trumpet; instead playing beautifully, free trumpet solos that soar with clarity and energy.  The sound on this entire CD is tight and Louis' assertive playing has never sounded so reassured.  Overall, the sound is jazzy and none of the pop stuff Armstrong played for White audiences tends to surface.  Only Louis' and Duke's unrestrained talents shine through.<br />I love this CD and if anyone can recommend to me a similar effort; let me know!!<br />Meanwhile, if you haven't heard this incredible effort; buy it!!
B000001Y2U|5.0|You are here, so you are interested in Marilyn Manson in some way.  Well, you've got to have this CD.  I listen to it when I'm partying.  I listen to it through my headphones at work.  This is THE Marilyn Manson CD, you won't be disappointed, especially by the build-up to and within Little Horn.
6305910103|5.0|1982's STAR TREK - THE WRATH OF KHAN was a dream come true for TREK fans everywhere. The return of series' villain Khan Noonian Singh, consumed by his obsession to exact revenge on Admiral Kirk for the death of his wife, resulted in a TREK that was bolder and more dramatic than ever before, (or since -- take note, Rick Berman!) Key to the rebirth was the hiring of director Nicholas Meyer, an admitted novice to the STAR TREK phenomenon who nonetheless drew an astounding, best-ever performance from Shatner and created a taut, tightly-paced adventure in the tradition of the series' finest episodes. As usual, DeForest Kelley steals scene after scene.<br />From the very beginning, Paramount has lead the charge in packing their DVD's with supplementary materials, and this disc doesn't disappoint. For starters, there are two VERY cool behind-the-scenes documentaries: STAR TREK: RECAPTURING THE MAGIC explores the effort that went into ensuring the film FELT like STAR TREK, while the second documentary, IKE EISENMANN: FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN TO THE MILKY WAY, examines in exhausting detail how the actor went from child star at Disney to his tour of duty aboard the Enterprise in KHAN. Both shorts are interesting and informative, and above all, fun. But the studio didn't stop there; in addition to the documentaries, we get a pristine transfer of the film's original theatrical trailer, a generous collection of TV spots, and a rare, seldom seen teaser trailer created expressly for the Polish market. But the real jewel of the extras is the inclusion of an entire taping of The Merv Griffin Show from 1982 featuring Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley, just prior to the release of the film. That alone would have been sufficient to make the disc a must-buy, but Paramount ups the ante by giving us not one, not two, but 25 audio commentaries!!! This treasure trove of extras, combined with the dynamic picture and sound of the film transfer, will have TREK fans everywhere rushing to beam this one up!
0393316041|5.0|I found this book to be easy to read, fun to read, and memorable. I feel it increased my scientific curiosity about the world around me. For example his testing the ability of his mind to time something, I try occasionally and find I am very bad at it.  I think he wanted to learn about everything and it was interesting to me that he came across as psychologically blind.  This made me more aware of my own blind spots, such as my inability to see any beauty in a Braque painting, whereas someone I greatly respect can go into ecstasy over them. It was fun to be a fly on the wall allowed to be let in on some aspects of the life of one of the great scientists.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King wrote or co-wrote many classic songs that defined several eras of rock n roll.  On Tapestry Carole proves that she is quite an adept performer.  Every song on this collection is a winner.  I Feel The Earth Move and So Far Away may be the radio favorites but Home Again is the real hidden gem.  Will You Still Love Me Tomorow is an alltimer.  Danny Korchmar makes some nice contributions on guitar and James Taylor contributes some good vocal harmonies.  For those who like the softer sounds of the seventies, pick this one up at once.
B00001OH7N|5.0|I like to think of &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot; as a precursor of cerebral hard rock such as early Pere Ubu and Bowie's own Tin Machine. Unlike most hard rock of that era (1970), &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot; is less about testosterone and machismo, and more about insanity and the ways it pervades society. Another aspect that distinguishes this Bowie release from all of his later ones is that the musicians are given free rein to jam, albeit within a different context from most blues-based bands of the time. This is strange, heavy music with elements of folk and psychedelia, but well worth checking out
B000002552|3.0|This CD collection is really beginning to grow on me.  The instrumental touches on this double CD are pretty creative for the most part.  Garth Hudson in particular adds some quriky organ and saxaphone solos.  Check out Orange Juice Blues.  J.R. Robertson adds some slick guitar solos.  Just listen to Long Distance Operator, Odds And Ends, and Don't Ya Tell Henry.  I love Levon Helm's vocals on the later track.  I'm not the biggest fan of Bob Dylan's vocals as there are moments when his wheezy vocals are quite annoying.  However, there are afew songs where Mr. Dylan actually tries to sing and he truly sounds quite good a songs like This Wheel's On Fire and Tears Of Rage.  The harmonies only add to the beauty of those songs.<br />I wish that there were a few more rock n roll based numbers on this disc in the vein of Don&quot;t Ya Tell Henry and Long Distance Operator.  Levon Helm was not present for many of these tunes and his strong backbeat was surely missed.  None the less, there are plenty of good songs throughout this record.  3 1/2 stars sounds right to me.
6304316267|5.0|A zany cross country race based on an <BR>actual event called &quot;The Cannonball <BR>Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash.&quot; The brainchild of writer Brock <BR>Yates, who competed in the first Cannonball in 1971. The object is to <BR>drive as fast and as safely as possible from Connecticut to Redondo Beach, California. <BR>In every Cannonball, no driver or person has ever been injured. <BR>The worst case, a team or two put behind <BR>bars for no more than an hour. <BR>&quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; is based on real <BR>characters and adventures. It was penned <BR>by Yates,  who makes an appearance in the early stages of the movie as the &quot;organizer.&quot; <BR> <BR>Burt Reynolds headlines an all star lineup as &quot;J.J. McClure&quot; a wealthy <BR>entrepreneur who, along with his  <BR>'executive assistant' Victor Prinze, <BR>played with great verve by comedian <BR>Dom DeLuise. Victor has some issues. <BR>In times of 'mortal danger' his personality changes from mild mannered <BR>mechanic, into an alter-ego called <BR>&quot;Captain Chaos&quot; who wreaks havoc on <BR>some less than respectable hombres we encounter along the way. <BR>Farrah Fawcett is teamed with J.J. and Victor when she's kidnapped in their ambulance. <BR>Jack Elam as &quot;Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing&quot; provides lots of laughs <BR>and few chills when needed.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Veteran performers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. join the ensemble as <BR>a pair of priests in a souped-up Ferrari. <BR> <BR>Roger Moore makes a departure from his <BR>'James Bond' character playing &quot;Seymor Goldfarb.&quot; An individual who believes he's <BR>Roger Moore. It's a great spoof and Moore plays it with perfection. <BR> <BR>Mel Tillis and former quarterback <BR>Terry Bradshaw show up as just a  <BR>couple of good ol' boys ala &quot;Dukes <BR>of Hazzard&quot; style, toting cases of beer but sans the &quot;General Lee.&quot;  <BR>  <BR>Tara Buckman and Adrienne Barbeau are seen throughout the film in their <BR>custom black Lamborghini Countach, <BR>breaking speed limits and the hearts <BR>of some unsuspecting law enforcement <BR>officers along the route.  <BR> <BR>Jamie Farr from &quot;MASH&quot; is cast in the role of a Sheik obsessed with winning the Cannonball <BR>in a hot-rod Rolls Royce. <BR> <BR>The Cannonball Run was directed by <BR>Hal Needham who brought us &quot;Smokey and <BR>the Bandit&quot; and &quot;Hooper.&quot; Hal and Brock <BR>were partners in a Cannonball held in the late 70S.  Needham sets a flat out, <BR>pedal to the metal pace for &quot;Cannonball&quot; and it doesn't let <BR>up till the finish line. <BR> <BR>After twenty years, this film still makes you laugh. Rent it tonight :)
0792101448|5.0|Henry Fonda gives a great role as a villian in the old west in this Sergio Spagetthi Western helping to show what he is capable of doing. The camera work is brilliant like any sergio leone movie showing off the old west and helping to convey emotions about scenes and characters.
B00000JCOV|5.0|It doesn't matter what i say, i can't say enough about this guys. Slipknot help form Fallen Maggot. This is their best C.D., no only that, but it is the [edit]ing BEST (and i mean BEST) C.D. ever produced, end of story. Of course this gets the Fallen Maggot seal of approval. [edit]ing rock on. Buy this C.D., for God's sake, buy it, you will not be disapointed at all. There is no bad song on the album.<BR>Warning: if you find Slipknot's \\"Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat\\" C.D., don't buy it for the music, the C.D. itself is horrible, the vocalist ..., they replaced him with Corey thank God.<br />-FM
B000005HFH|5.0|As a fan of Chet Baker's for almost nine years now, particularly of his singing, in my opinion this is one of his three best albums (the other two which I highly recommend - although they are hard to find but well worth the search - are: Let's Get Lost (the Soundtrack to the film about the life of Chet Baker- RCA,AAD,89), and Chet Baker Sings Again (Timeless SJP 238). This album contain many of Chet Baker's best early songs, but does not include his best later recordings, and has omitted some early gems too, such as How Long Has This Been Going On; Forgetful (Chet has four amazing versions of this publicly available, each one quite unique); Come Rain or Shine; or Angel Eyes. For completeness this album should have also included his best vocal recording from later in his career, which are mind-bogglingly poignant and reveal a depth and reticence in Chet Baker that his early recording only hint at, specifically: Moon and Sands; For Heaven Sakes Let's Fall In Love; You're My Thrill; Autumn Leaves; Alone Together; and I Can't Get Started With You. The opportunity is still out there to compile a more comprehensive, definitive set of Chet's best songs, a collection that would fairly reflect both his early and later achievements as a searing, raw, vulnerable singer, who shows here that he is - as a point of reference - on a par with John Lennon in the directness and honesty of his delivery. While it's hard to pick favorites on an album like this, in which (in my opinion) almost all the songs are stellar, one or two do lead the pack (in this order): i) I Remember You; ii) Just Friends; iii) Long Ago and Far Away; iv) It's Always You; v) Daybreak; vi) Time After Time. ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00005A46T|5.0|This C.D. is deffinitely a hell (and i mean a HELL) of a lot harder than &quot;Slipkot&quot;, but it sort of lacks the quality of the first one. Don't get me wrong, this is one of the best albums i have ever heard, but still. The songs &quot;People=S***&quot;, &quot;Disasterpiece&quot;, and &quot;Heretic Anthem&quot; are disturbing as [edit] and are the best songs on the album. This deffinitely gets my seal of approval. Buy this album. It as simple as that.<br />-FM
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is that rare thing! A sequel that's better than the original (although it's not &quot;really&quot; a sequel in any of the characters from the Lock, Stock &amp; You Know The Rest).<BR>Ritchie's maybe employing the same formula and some may argue &quot;Snatch&quot; offers nothing new, but same can be said for certain George Lucas and his original Star Wars trilogy, or F.F. Coppola's Godfather epic. My answer is the same for all: &quot;Why change something that works?&quot; At least until it becomes a boring routine, which this is not (yet).<BR>The story involves fixing illegal boxing matches, diamond heist and sumggling and then it gets complicated (in a goody good way).<BR>Characters are so comic (in both meaning of the word), dialogues sharp and funny and directing is stylish and fast-paced.<BR>There are so many good special features on this DVD, but the best has to be parallel viewing of the storyboards and the final cut of the movie, which can really help anyone who wants to see how te movie is made...
B00000JPHG|4.0|well I always LOVED the child's play series.  This one is not like the first 3.  This movie has knew characters like TiFF and alot of others.  the only same person from the first 3 is ChUcKy!! This movie could have been better if it had Andy back in it OR... told what happened to Andy after he went in the police car in part 3!!! I liked The Child's Play series because in the begining they showed what happened in the last chucky movie.  This movie had no follow up on any of the other 3.  I was kinda sad that chucky never said anything about Andy or Tyler.  This movie was still funny like the others but... a little more comedy in the movie than scary.<BR>1 other thing I didn't like about this movie is THE MUSIC.  Child's play music was always the best.  This was not like music that we all heard in the first 3 movies.  Overall this is a very good movie.  YOU should see it!!!!
0441172717|5.0|It seems the book has received many reviews on it's finer and lesser than finer points. All of them are valid and well made (but like everything in life - should be judged with a grain of salt).<br />I would like to add only a couple of points -<br />First, I thank Frank Herbert for the literary gift to humanity - for this book (and series) is not just attempting to be a SciFi book. It has many rich ideas about the flaws and beauties of humanity under a guise of another world created in 'science fiction'. Second, the best way to start this series is to delve into it with no precept of any kind - not even what you would expect from a Sci-Fi story. It gives you much more - a reflection of our universe through the eyes of an incredibly creative man.<br />There are parts of the series where it gets a bit wordy. But I respect it nonetheless because if the book was any different, than it would not be the masterful piece of work it is. Besides, how many of us in the ENTIRE WORLD can give to us in literary form, a story of an entire universe full of such diverse beings carried through for generations with plots within plots, with truly unwavering ideologies and philosophies directly parallel to our own humanity and issues? Plus, with the scientific ground work which it was all laid upon?<br />Considering when Herbert wrote this book and the immense research and work put into it by ONE man, TO SAY THIS IS ANYTHING LESS THAN GENIOUS &amp; BRILLIANT, WOULD BE ARROGANT. <br />Lastly, this book is for people who have INSIGHT, VISION and a desire to be open-minded. I say a desire because if you are patient enough to read this series diligently, this book will be a good place for all those who desire open-mindedness. I have no judgment towards any of the characters or story plots. I think there is much to learn from all of it, even to the most trivial and the smallest.
B000021YQV|5.0|First off, I will say that I am by no means a metal listener. Then again, this isn't a conventional metal album.The album does feature a lot of harsh sounds but there are just as many tranquil and quirky noises thrown into the mix.  System of a Downs 'Toxicity' is a very refreshing album and is definitely worth checking out!
B000003B6J|5.0|With a combination of Ice Cube's raging lyrics, MC Ren's rhymical mastery, Eazy E's stinging vocabulary and beats from none other than yella and the one and only Dr Dre its not difficult to see that this is, and will remain to be the finest rap album of all time.
B00003CXN4|1.0|First off i like the &quot;deep&quot; &quot;art like&quot; type movies just like the next guy but this movie just had me wishing it would end. The plot and characters were like.... annoying...i think thats the best word to use. I GAVE my DVD copy away to someone as soon as it ended (i had to talk them into it mind you). This is just another example of Holloywood falling in love with a movie/director/actor  and no matter what junk they make, its always &quot;thumps up&quot;. Lets not mention how the heck did DelTorro get the best supporting actor award?...did my copy have like 20 or 30 minutes of some outstanding performance footage that was missing on it? Hey i even like the guy but he was in the movie only for some short time and his performance was like anyone elses in the movie...average at best. Someone tell me at what part in the movie did he perform such a powerful scene that you were left with your mouth open?...can someone tell me?. Well i guess this was just one  of those &quot;overated movies of 2000.&quot; it seems to me none of the movies that were up for &quot;Best Movie of the Year&quot; deserved to be there. Hollywood is just running out of ideas.
B00001NFMF|5.0|i cant believe this is the first review.this one,is a fun sexy music.the flute melodys are very chearfull.very happy feeling cd indeed.this is tull\\"s first cd,recorded in the \\"greenhouse\\" england.the cd is a little too short 38.43 min,but get it any way it will make you feel good!
B00005K3NR|4.0|I'm happy to say that, for the most part, the DVD release of &quot;Carrie&quot; is quite good. The film itself is clean and appears to be intact. The sound quality is quite good, and has been put into Dolby 5.1 surround format. And for those who might want to experience the film the same way they remember it in theaters, the original mono sound format is available too.<br />This DVD has lots of good extras. There are two featurettes, each a little more than 40 minutes long, that talk at length about casting/acting aspects of the film, and the visual style of the film. Both are interesting, of high quality, and include interviews and discussions with principle actors and the director. There is also a short discussion of the musical version of Carrie (no footage from the musical though), an animated photo gallary, and a couple of text pieces.<br />The menus are well designed. The main menu is animated, as are the menu transitions. The menu animation and music/sound are creepy and disturbing, meaning they are wonderfully consistent with the movie. This is a good example of the RIGHT way to release a classic film on DVD.<br />With three exceptions.<br />The biggest detraction from this DVD is that there are no deleted scenes included. They talk about some cut scenes in the featurettes that sound really neat, but they are not included on the DVD! Why??? They don't say why. They're just not there. For example, there were scenes from Carrie's youth where the term &quot;dirty pillows&quot; is introduced, as well as early signs of her telekinetic capabilities, including a rain of gravel during a particularly enraging event that foreshadows the rain of boulders that destroy the house at the end. I would have LOVED to see this extended canvas, either as deleted scenes or in a &quot;director's cut&quot; version of the film, but you won't find either on this DVD.<br />The second problem is the lack of a commentary track for the film. Running commentaries provide a wealth of insight into what was going on in the scenes and behind the scenes. Personally I think that every film released on DVD should have at least one commentary track.<br />The third problem is minor, but it's a pet peeve of mine. There are no English subtitles for the movie. I am a little hearing impaired, and I really like to have good subtitles to help me make out the words during scenes where the words are a bit jumbled, or there's too much noise to make out what people are saying.<br />Bottom line: If you like this movie, you're going to enjoy this DVD. It's not a home run, but it has more extras and is designed better than most DVD releases of movies from this period.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I been a Green Day since 1999 when I first started to listen to Green Day after my dad bought it and never picked it up again. I have every Green Day album to date and Warning is definatly an instant classic. This is a new sound for Green Day and most people really liked it.<BR>1.Warning-This is a great start up for the album. It's about having no safety in the world.<BR>2.Blood,Sex and Booze-This is one of the few rock songs on this album. This song will run through your head all day. Also great performed live!<BR>3.Church On Sunday-This song is also a rock song. It's about Billie Joe and Addrienne's marriage. It's a sad song but it one of my favorites on the album.<BR>4.Fashion Victim-About being a fashion victim in middle school and highschool.<BR>5.Castaway-The song is about a loner out on his own. One of the most popular songs on the record.<BR>6.Misery-This song is alot different from any other Green Day songs Tre'plays accordian, Mike plays the Farfisa, and Billie plays mandolin. It's about different people living in misery. This was written by the band.<BR>7.Dead Beat Holiday- This is about celebrating a dead beat holiday.<BR>8.Hold On- Billie Joe wrote this song for a friend who lost three loved ones in one year.<BR>9.Jackass-This song about idiots and how irritating they are.<BR>10.Waiting-This is about waiting a long time for something to come. This is Billie's favorite song on the record.<BR>11.Minority-This song is the most popular song on the record. The whole song is great.<br />12.Macy's Day Parade- About thinking about the things that you don't have. This song is an awesome closing to a GREAT Green Day record.<BR>If you don't have Warning get it TODAY you won't be sorry!

6305078181|2.0|The color is so washed-out that the film is very disappointing. I have liked the movie over the years, but this DVD leaves much to be desired. The video tape is a better viewing even though it is not widescreen.
B000059XUP|5.0|The Crow - City of Angels, to me, is an excellent film. It manages to be an entertaining sequel without stealing anything away from the original. The character, Ash played by Vincent Perez(I Dreamed of Africa,Swept From the Sea), is brutally murdered along with his young son and then...you know the rest...a crow will show him the way. Vincent Perez gave an excellent performance that is bursting with emotion. He manages to portray exactly what the character is feeling. The character of Ash is completely different from that of Brandon Lee's Eric Draven. What is fun to watch, however, is the physical similiarities they both share, being around the same height, lean build, and age. I liked the make-up much better in this one, not as dramatic as the first; less is definately more!<BR>Once Ash is geared up and ready to go, he one by one hunts down those who wronged him leaving behind a symbol of how they took part in his murder. The set is gothic and dark, the special effects are well rendered, and the acting is excellent. The only complaint that people may have is that it is not Brandon Lee. All I can say is, take the movie for what it is, a different story and installment of the crow fantasy, NOT a replacement of the first. If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it. Although I am still a huge fan of Brandon Lee, I like this installment of the Crow just as much if not more. After seeing this film, I instantly became a fan of Perez's as well. The always perfect theme of good vs. evil rings true in this movie. Go ahead and experience the hope and wonder of this film and take satisfaction as Ash is able to &quot;make the wrong things right.&quot;
B00004RHZU|5.0|A cross between pop and R&amp;B to hip hop all rolled into one. A very dance/club cd. I can easily listen to this cd all the way through. Pink has a unique voice...which is why I think she could easily fit into the pop category as well as the R&amp;B category. The whole cd is easy to sing along to.<br />My favorites on the cd are Split Personality-I enjoy the concept of the song. Pointing out the other side of Pink and....everyone else!! ;-)<br />Hell Wit Ya...great beat and rhythm.<BR>You Make Me Sick...again a great beat to it.<BR>Let Me Let You Know...a pleasant ballad. One step up from being a slow ballad.<BR>Stop Falling...a slow ballad. Wonderfully done. About a woman who is afraid (or isn't ready) to fall in love.<BR>Do What You Do...a simple song, with simple words but a great message about doing what you want to do and, moreorless, not caring what people say or think.<br />Among others. I don't know how anyone, if they listen to the cd, doesn't lip along or even move. It's a catchy album. A nice debut and I hope to see more from her!!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I went to see this movie without ever seeing any advertisements for it, except for a billboard. I didn't expect anything of it but I was blown away nevertheless! This isn't your typical film. It's absolutely wonderful and Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing with their own voices. The costumes were great, the dialogue was great (even though it was, at times, borrowed). It must have been hard to make entirely new songs out of lines from old ones. I loved this movie so much I bought the book and learned little secrets and got to see excellent photographs you don't see in the film. I'm going to buy it when it comes out on tape and DVD! I recommend this to everyone!
B00004SCX6|5.0|In my opinion, compared to her old album &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; this album is a VERY GOOD improvement. The songs are really catchy and the beats make you wanna dance. If you enjoy pure pop music you just have to have this one.<br />1. Oops!...I Did It Again- Everyone should know this single by now. It's a fun song and a nice beat.<br />2. Stronger- One of my favorite songs on here. I like her voice on this song and it is extremely catchy. The beat is just sooo cool, and the err....ummm....robot-type 'special effects' in her voice really make this song rememberable.<br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door- It's a catchy song, but I don't usually listen to that much.<br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction- er....um...not much to say about this one...Can't say that I like it, but I can't say I don't like it. Maybe you should here it on your own. -_-<br />5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know- I really don't like this song. The video was cool, but the song is definetely NOT what was expected for the next single.<br />6. What U See (Is What U Get)- Another one of my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE songs. It is really catchy and I love the beat on this one. For people who like N*Sync's songs &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; and &quot;It's Gonna Be Me&quot;. The beat is kind of a combination of those two. ^_^<br />7. Lucky- A whole lot of people like this song and think it's the best off the album. I think it is not. It's maybe one of those songs that you have to get used to in order to like.<br />8. One Kiss From You- It's kinda like a song that 'a mother would sing her teenage daughter after her father told her she couldn't have a boyfriend'. I like it.<br />9. Where Are You Now- Out of all the slow songs on the album, this one is best and one of my favorites. Her voice sounds so beautiful on this track. <br />10. Can't Make You Love Me- Hollywood Pop Style. Very catchy and fun to listen to. People who like N*Sync will also enjoy this track.<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It- ....oh please,waste of Britney Spears talent.<br />12. Dear Diary- A total waste of Britney Spears talent. If she wanted to play piano she could've done a better job then this. Somebody should've made this a better song.<br />Let me put it this way, this album so a definete buy. ^_~
B000031XCR|3.0|I mean I love Celine Dion but what about her earlier songs, and all by myself is a major hit, forget about that one?
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a great book. I love all the characters, especialy Sabriel. She has so much depth to her, she seems as real as you and me. The plot in this book has so many twists and turns, you will be on your toes the whole time. This is my all-time favorite book. i hope you will love it as much as I do.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This is a great  film with a great twist at the end, however about midway into the film i found my self annoyed hoping it would just end soon. however i do have to say that i did not guess the ending at all and it was a complete surprise.
0451167716|5.0|After reading the reviews that lean toward &quot;negative&quot;, I'm amazed.  This is one of the best examples of pure storytelling ever printed.  Yes, it gets VERY in depth about the lives of characters and events that shape the body of the novel.  That is the novels strength.  The first movie and the pre-quile part of the second are excellent, because they follow the story telling to the letter.  I did see the movie before I read the book, and after reading the book......it was the difference between reading Cliff Notes and reading the actual classic.  I enjoyed the movie so much more the second time I saw it, because I understood things that the director could only hint at.<br />An excellent, excellent novel!
B00004TJFL|2.0|This movie was a major dissapointment to me. The gore and stuff is fine it's just that the characters are soooooooo annoying! Rent this movie before you buy it!<BR>...
0452282152|5.0|As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I was quite impressed by Tracy Chevalier's novel GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING.  Using the famous Vermeer painting as a launch pad, Ms. Chevalier invents a life for the historically unknown subject of this portrait.  Along the way, she provides convincing character portraits for Griet, Vermeer, and numerous other people encircling their lives.  Ms. Chevalier also captures the essence of their time and creates a realistic setting for her novel.  Great book.  Read it soon.

0792846710|4.0|I remember seeing this movie on TV as a little kid, but since then hadn't seen it for a long time until I bought it. This is a GREAT movie for anyone who likes dumb movies like me, but even if you don't, this movie will still keep you laughing. The clowns are very funny, especially the little one. I definitely recomend it.
B00003CXSP|4.0|The book, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is the most depraved, disgusting work I have had the misfortune of reading. I kept thinking as I read it that it could not get worse, but it did. I HATED the book and was not really interested in seeing the film version of it. But I recently watched the magnificant &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; again and decided to see how a film could possibly have been made of &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster were so wonderful in &quot;Silence&quot; that I could not imagine how another actress could possibly play Clarice and have the same relationship and depth of emotions with Lecter even though she was now 10 years older with a lot more experience.<br />So with these prejudices, I watched &quot;Hannibal&quot;. It was a decent film, but very flawed. So much had to be left out and so much was changed. The whole situation with Verger in the book was completely changed. In the book he could not leave his bed because his body had been shriveled and distorted by the hanging he went through during his session with Lecter. The only thing shown in the film was the result of his shaving his face off. The whole family situation with his lesbian sister was gone which was vital to his character. This meant that a whole new method of killing him was necessary. The fact that she killed him to gain the family fortune was gone plus the symbolism of his eel like body being fed to the large eel he kept as a pet. Much of his character was altered for the film. Also his make-up was less than satisfactory. I kept thinking how the make-up for the Phantom of the Opera in the stage musical would have been much for effective for Verger - more horrible and more in keeping with the idea of a face being removed. What is seen in the film is too obviously a mask. Gary Oldman's performance is lessened by this makeup. He is excellent but could have been even more effective in other make-up.<br />Anthony Hopkins is magnificent as Lecter and is the main reason to watch the film. His performance is multi-layered and always fascinating. He is the finest actor around today and always worth watching. One deleted scene on the DVD where he gets into Clarice's car and licks the steering wheel is chilling and riviting. But each of his scenes is magnetic, he doninates even those scenes when just his voice is heard.<br />Unfortunately Julianne Moore just does not make it as Clarice. She is, at best, only competant. She is acceptable in the role, but never plumbs the depths of the character. A viewer keeps wondering what the character could have been with Jody Foster. Her ghost dominates each of Clarice's scenes. Even Miss Moore's voice is a pale imitation of Miss Foster's. <br />One of the things that saves the film from the excesses of the book is that Clarice does not become Lecter's lover and waltz off on the patio with him as Krendler sits babbling at the table with the top of his head off as in the climax of the book. BUT the ending of the film with Lecter sharing the &quot;lunch&quot; with the little oriental boy on the plane is even more perverse and really more horrifing than anything else in the film.<br />After having rented the DVD, I will now purchase a copy to have as a companion to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Manhunter&quot; so I will have the three Hannibal Lecter films, but it is the least satisfying of the three.
0345440757|4.0|All in all, I found this book's contents to be a good level-headed approach -- it's not too complicated, and easy to remember.<BR>I have to admit, I haven't had the baby yet, so I haven't yet put the information into practice!  But, as a first-time mom who hasn't had very much experience with babies or babysitting, it does give me confidence in being able to handle this new little human being in my home.  The two strongest concepts that I drew from the book are 1. You don't have to lose your mind every time the baby cries -- take a moment to understand what the baby is trying to communicate to you, and 2. Get the baby on a schedule -- not a tight one, but one that you can live with.  You're the one in charge, not the baby.
B00000294R|4.0|&quot;Lifestylez ov da poor and dangerous&quot; by Big L is so very close to being a hip hop masterpiece, but it unfortunately falls just short of the line. Now it's not any problem with Big L because the flow and lyrics he puts down on this album are amazing. The real problem with this album are it's beats, while songs like &quot;Put it on&quot;, &quot;No endz, no skinz&quot;, &quot;Street struck&quot;, and &quot;Fed up with the bull...&quot; are masterpieces, most of the others on the album fall short beatwise because alot them are just flat out boring. But Big L's talent definetly makes up for the lack of beats on some songs, which makes it worth a listen for any rap fan new or old.
0452282152|5.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier is an historical fiction set in Holland in 1664.<BR>It tells the story of the painting by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. The painting is a real one, and you can see it on the front cover of the book.<BR>Griet, the heroine of the book comes to the Vermeer house as a servant, and the book is written with Griet as the narrator. We follow Griet through her hard work for the Vermeer family, her first meeting with the father of the family and how he wants to paint her. Griet falls deeply in love with her master, and the book tells a beautiful though heartbreaking story of love and sacrifice. Griet is not only falling in love with her master, but also in his life of colors and paintings. Griet masters the art of mixing colors, and through her work together with Vermeer their relationship becomes very intimat.<BR>The clue of this story is the way it is told through Griet, and the way she manage to bring us with her to her 17th century world in Delft. I loved the book when I read it the first time, have reread it, and know I will read it again. It's a jewel of a novel, or on other words - a master painting. And it has made me interested in other books with the same theme, Dutch art and Dutch history.

0380817683|4.0|I couldn't wait to read Rachel's Holiday after devouring &quot;Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married,&quot; and I was not disappointed.  From the very start, Ms. Keyes grabs our attention and maybe a little sympathy for the main character, Rachel.  Rachel is in a rehabilitation program after a suicide attempt - however, Rachel is also in denial that she attempted suicide - let alone that she has a drug problem.<br />Through flashbacks and her therepy, we find a lot about Rachel that is as bittersweet as it is shocking and depressing.  It is an excellent read and the supporting characters from Rachel's sisters to roommates are all familliar to us. <br />I loved this book until the ending.  While I am glad it ended on a happy note - I think it is a little unbelievable - but other than that - a very good read.
B00004Z459|1.0|My original review for &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; I praised Linkin Park for their efforts, up to this day I am not sure why.  Rap rock is a genre that should be sedated, crossing them has always produced disgust in me (Limp Bizkit).  I should of learned after buying &quot;Signifcant Other&quot;, but no, I made the mistake of picking this one up as well.  Here is a hint for Linkin Park, ditch your horrible MC, trash the DJ and start over.  Don't get me wrong, I listen to hip-hop, I am a big techno fan, so I have nothing against either of those two, but this is just horrible.
0792839730|5.0|The movie did a great job in bringing the battles back into life.  It is full of epic battle scenes that are historically accurately and well-shot, especially the cross-river assault by 82nd airborne soldiers, the battle encountered by 30th corps, the bridge assult by SS grenadiers.  Important commanders of this battle are very well-cast.  The story is also very well-balanced, the role of Polish brigrade and Dutch resistance were included.  This movie has done a better job than movies like The Longest Day in showing you a WW2 battle!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|...OKAY now that I got your attention, &quot;The Battle Of Los Angeles&quot; by Rage Against the Machine is raw and hard edged music with a purpose. Tom Morello's guitar playing is amazing, and Zach De La Rocha's vocals give the band a perfect touch. Originally I didn't like them, but after hanging out with my friend alot who happens to really like them, they began to grow on me, and I eventually ended up with this album. Songs like &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot;, &quot;Calm Like a Bomb&quot;, &quot;Sleep now in the fire&quot; really hit hard just like the rest of the anti-politically fueled album.
B000007OY0|5.0|Stephen King and Frank Darabont are quite a team. They did 'The Green Mile' together, another superb prison drama. 'Shawshank' is definately a classic, and as far as I'm concerned, it's up there with the cinema greats of all time. Some critics moaned it was too long, but the 140 minutes soon go, you forget it's that long. Moving, often violent, this film is a must see. Simply brilliant.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Ever since I noticed the hype around this movie and its soundtrack I confess I had been a bit skeptical about watching it: I'm not a fan of bluegrass music or movies that take place in the beginning of the 20th century, but the Cohen Brothers most recent masterpiece (they have The Big Lebowski and Fargo among others, in their background) proved me wrong.<br />The whole theme for the movie can be based off Homer's &quot;Oddisey&quot; or even &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; as one reviewer conmmented before. But the real key to the heart of this movie is the goof nature of the characters: just as Joel Cohen says in the production featurette included in the DVD, the funny trio are like the &quot;Three Stooges.&quot;<br />This has been one clever movie all through which I was able to laugh very hard, and the funniest thing about it is that it's not a comedy at all. More like the struggles of this runaway trio you sympathize with from the very start, to find some treasure that Ulysees Everett McGill (played by Clooney) buried before going to prison. Through their adventures they face the sirens call, they oppose the cyclops (Big Dan Teague, played by John Goodman) and hit local musical stardom not knowing about it with the song &quot;Man of constant sorrow.&quot;<br />The acting is very solid: Clooney, Turturro and Nelson all play great roles. The cinematography, by Roger Deakins (long time film companion of the Cohen brothers), is even more outstanding: it is the first time the entire post-production of a film is done digitally. The process used for doing this is explained in extensive detail in a very interesting featurette included in the DVD.<br />Overall, deserving all the credit and the hype around it: it's an authentice masterpiece overall. Thanks to the Joel and Ethan Cohen for such good film making.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I've been a Disney fan for forever, the release of this DVD is amazing.  Finally a true marriage of technology and artistry.   I love Snow White because it gave us one of the best villans ever, there would be no Snow White without Malificent.  Thank you Disney, when can I expect the release of the other vaulted classics?
0385486804|2.0|i thought this book was boring and even though it was supposed to be adventurous i found the book to be very boring. it is a great story but poorly written.
B00005ASOI|5.0|When I smuggled this from Begium on the Best Video label I did not think much of it coss it was grainy, one scene was cut and it was not meant to be seen in that state. However, I decided to view it this way and what an experience. WOW! It is mazing, uncut, great quality in sound and picture letting you enjoy this classic the way it should be seen.
B00004U8H4|4.0|I have just watched this film for the second time, and have finally come to some real conclusions about it. I have also read the novel, by Ellis. First let me say that the film is both a brilliant adaptation of the novel as well as being only a pale shadow of it. The adaptation was brilliant in that it adapted the most significant parts of the novel in terms of theme, rather than turning the film into a gore fest. Yes, this film is about a serial killer, but it is also about alienation and emptiness and the utter despair of having everything but having nothing worthwhile. I think that often the real meaning of the book and the film go unnoticed. Yes, it is a brilliant film in terms of cinematography and plot, but what does it all mean? Patrick Bateman, our protagonist, says at the beginning that he does not really exist, and throughout the film he is always mistaken for someone else. I think this film has a great deal to say about alienation, about the emptiness of modern life. It really has the same theme as Fight Club, though that theme is represented differently. But that theme still comes through very strongly: that modern society has lost touch with reality, that it is estranged and unfocused, and that people need something more than lots of money, high rise apartments and perfect bodies. Bateman becomes a killer because he needs to feel something just as the guys in Fight Club initiated fights in order to really feel, to feel that they were alive. I think that American Psycho is more a general comment on society than it is on serial killers. But it stands as an important commentary, a very valuable film. I would have given it a full five stars, but the fact is that the film is not for everyone.<br />And, if you have any doubts, just seeing Christian Bale's performance is worth the entire film. Why he didn't get the Oscar is beyond my understanding. This is one of the greatest performances on film I have ever seen.
B00000JCOV|5.0|But very good! This is by far, one of the best heavy metal CD's I have. Good songs like (Sic), Eyeless, Wait and Bleed, Surfacing, Spit it Out, Liberate, and Scissors. I have to admit, Scissors is pretty sick in the lyrics. Oh well, who cares. Well parents can be a little over protective. But they will understand our music someday! Anyway, this album make you have adreniline rushes and it has very good guitars in it. What else is there to say, well, this album is well worth 15 bucks but I advise you to get the Digipack. That one has all the original songs on it, plus it has bonus tracks and demos...
B00005LKHW|2.0|Four high school seniors make a pact to lose their virignity before college.<BR>This is the premise for &quot;American Pie,&quot; a phenominally successful comedy that's long on raunch and short on laughs.<BR>&quot;American Pie&quot; has its moments, though. The scene in which Jason Biggs attempts to make love to an apple pie is hilarious; the cheesy &quot;Arabian&quot; rock band performing &quot;Midnight At The Oasis&quot; at the prom is sensational and what normal male between the ages of 12 and 75 could complain about Shannon Elizabeth's bedroom scene?<BR>This new &quot;ulitimate edition&quot; DVD is a bit of a sham, since there's little difference between the 'unrated' version and the print released commercially and the special features (deleted scenes, outtakes, commentaries) are by no means worthy of TWO discs!<BR>Essentially, &quot;American Pie&quot; is a touch of soft corn porn masquerading as a teen comedy and as Paul Mc Cartney once sang: &quot;what's wrong with that?&quot;
0451450523|1.0|I love books like Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Neverending Story, so seeing all of these titles compared to The Last Unicorn on the back cover, I thought this would be a book that I would enjoy.  However, I was very dissapointed. The Last Unicorn can't even be compared with the aforementioned masterpieces. I don't know why so many people love this book.  It is gloomy, depressing and very slow reading, almost to the point of boredom.  That is all I have to say on the subject.  Pick another book because this one is not worth reading.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie can be difficult to watch in the theatres because of the wierd accent especially Brad Pitt ... who plays an Irish Gypsy in the film. (Damn Pikeys .......... ;-)<BR>Thanks to DVD you can catch the dialogue in the subtitles and I guess that's what went wrong for this movie as the theatre audience felt a little helpless trying to understand the dialogue.<BR>Guy Ritchie in his latest offering gives us something which is a cross between &quot;Lock Stock and 2 Smoking barrels&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. <BR>The story involves Diamonds and underground bare-knuckle boxing and different gangs of underworld characters with interesting sub plots all intertwining into 1 single story. Snatch is a bit more riveting and also a lot more violent than LS2SB. Giving away the story would be a crime as half the fun in the movie is in the process of discovery and the element of surprise (sometimes shock !!!).Guy Ritchie handles the camerawork brilliantly and the actors playing their parts are well chosen. Jason Statham and Vinny Jones return along with some big stars like Dennis Farina, Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro. Overall a smart and witty film which inspite of the amazing complexity and the frequent jumping back and forth in time does not confuse the viewer.<BR>Memorable scenes ...<BR>Bullet-Tooth Tony --- &quot;Replica and Desert Eagle&quot;.<BR>Brad Pitt in all the scenes.<BR>Any scene with Dennis Farina especially the one at the customs<BR>'Anything to declare ?' ,  &quot;Yeah Don't go to London&quot;.<BR>This movie shows Guy Ritchie doing what he does best ... but I hope the next time around this extremely talented film maker tries something different instead of sticking to the formula.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie and actually went to watch it 4 times in the theatre and can't wait for it to come out on video. I just looked through all 354 reviews on this site and about 30 people said they couldn't stand it. Unfourtunately, most of those people said they left after 15-20 min. True the first 20 min of the movie are very fast paced, but it is mainly setting up the movie. Also many people say that the movie was predictable, probably because they say what happens in the begining. <br />Most people who see this movie will not be dissapointed. from this site alone, it shows about 90% of people will consider it the best movie they have seen in a long time!
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater, up until recently, was one of those bands that I had heard OF but never actually heard.  Being a huge Queensryche and Rush fan, I'd been told repeatedly that I should take a listen to DT.  When I decided to take the plunge, I quizzed my DT-loving acquaintances as to which CD I should purchase first.  Every one of them said, &quot;Images and Words.&quot;<br />Good choice, you guys.<br />Surprisingly, I'd never heard &quot;Pull Me Under,&quot; the lead-off song on IaW and the closest thing DT has had to a conventional hit.  Within the first few notes, however, I knew that I was going to love this song.  In fact, there's not a moment of downtime on IaW, and I haven't said that about a CD since probably Queensryche's &quot;Promised Land.&quot;  The musicianship is staggeringly good, particularly John Petrucci's blazing guitar work and the sheer percussion prowess of Mike Portnoy.  James LaBrie's voice sounds a lot like Anthrax's Joey Belladonna to me, but his range is excellent.  Keyboardist Kevin Moore (no longer with the band) and bassist John Myung are equally adept.  IaW has literally not left my car CD player in the two weeks I've had the CD.  The comparisons to Rush and Queensryche are apt, but DT has a little harder edge, a little more grounded sense in their lyrics, and small unexpected touches that make their sound uniquely their own (the sweet-sounding sax in &quot;Another Day&quot; is a good example).  The only drawback, if you can even call it that, was their image at the time.  My husband took a look at the photos in the booklet and said, &quot;These guys look like Firehouse.&quot;<br />So I will continue with my history of discovering bands years after they debut.  Dream Theater, however, was well worth the wait.
B000002LND|5.0|I personally have owned this one since its release date, and so far, I have worn out two cassettes and the print on my CD is beginning to rub off.  There's just no way to emphasize how extraordinary this collection is.  It's over an hour of pure sonic pleasure.   After so many years of hits, it's nothing short of astounding to look back on what Madonna has done and measure her impact on popular music (not to mention popular culture).  These songs have held up surprisingly well, while the derivative versions by other '80s divas (Paula Abdul, Jody Watley, et al) sound dated.  &quot;Holiday&quot; positively heralds the oncoming revolution that Madonna was to usher in, and &quot;Lucky Star&quot; is still one of the funkiest tracks to gain massive airplay.   As far as filler goes, there is none here.  Madonna's skill as a recording artist capable of churning out an album filled completely with quality didn't become evident until later in her career, so this collection is especially valuable as a filter for some of the weaker tracks on her earlier albums--and, in 1985, Madonna was such a massive star that some of her less impressive tracks were huge hits (&quot;Dress You Up,&quot; &quot;Angel,&quot; and &quot;Who's That Girl?&quot; are fun songs, but their omission on this album doesn't really detract from its wholeness).  Of course, everyone will have personal favorites from the Madonna hit parade that probably weren't up to snuff, too (I love &quot;Causing A Commotion,&quot; which was basically a reworking of &quot;Into The Groove&quot; and was justifiably left off &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;).   Everyone will be inclined to &quot;cherry-pick&quot; their way through this collection, skipping the songs they care less for, but in retrospect, many of these songs are comparable to the great singles of the 1950s and 1960s.  &quot;Crazy For You,&quot; &quot;Live To Tell,&quot; and &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; boast the most accomplished singing (the version of &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; included here is not the version on the video, though, but a remixed dance version).  &quot;Cherish,&quot; &quot;Material Girl,&quot; and &quot;Into The Groove&quot; are familiar to all, and at this point conjure up nothing but fond memories.  And there are also the classic Madonna controversies, &quot;Like A Virgin,&quot; &quot;Papa Don't Preach,&quot; and &quot;Justify My Love.&quot;   But perhaps the most amazing thing about this collection is the fact that two tracks, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; and &quot;La Isla Bonita,&quot; stand out as so ageless.  &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; was rumored to be a song that both Cyndi Lauper and Michael Jackson passed on, but now stands as one of Madonna's most unforgettable performances.  If you can separate yourself from the accompanying video (and, granted, that is not easy to do with any Madonna cut), &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; comes across with all the urgency of &quot;Please Mr. Postman.&quot;  &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; stands out as the most graceful track on the album (if not in Madonna's career), with haunting harmonies floating into and out of the chorus.  In retrospect, it's hard to imagine that this track was released less than four years into her career--back when my parents thought she was nothing but a passing fancy.   Madonna's superstar 1980s-era contemporaries--Michael Jackson, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen--have fallen from the public's favor in some sense.  Each of them has pursued his own creative goals and held on to his most ardent fans.  But Madonna's achievement--maintaining the same level of popularity--is nothing short of shocking.  With the hits still coming for Madonna, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; stands as a complete overview of the first phase of her career and the key to understanding all subsequent phases.  As the liner notes say, Madonna takes you there.
B00005NW02|1.0|I really can't believe how \\"melodic\\" (wussy) this cd was. I waited anxiously to buy it and when i did, i was so disapointed at the way SOAD changed. If the only song you liked off their first cd was \\"Spiders\\", then you will love this cd. If you preferred the real hard core metal sounds of SOAD, then I'm afraid you'll be sorry if you buy it. I hope their next cd sounds more like the first than this ... sequel.

0871137380|5.0|I came across this book a few years earlier while looking for something to read on an 18-hour flight. The author happened to be in-store signing books that day, so I decided to check it out. This book is a moment by moment retelling of the worst U.S. military firefight since Viet Nam. It is told through the eyes of participants from both sides of the Battle of Mogadishu. The author writes in his book the exhaustive research that went into it, and tells the story accurately and objectively(judging by what I've heard from people who are authorities on the subject). The book is graphic, but it humanizes the participants in this battle at the same time. Anyone in the military should read this book. It will give them a better appreciation of what may one day be expected of them. Civilians should read this book to gain an understanding of the sacrifices made by the military. It is pertinent to everyone because it shows the results of good intentions gone bad, and faliure of a government to hold to it's own policies.
B000001E3V|5.0|Derek &amp; The Dominoes was one of rock's first jam bands. Whereas their classic album LAYLA (1970) can be best remembered as the prime mixing of the blues and dual rock lead guitar, IN CONCERT is the testament of their impressive jamming abilities. They were associated with the Allman Brothers Band due to Duane Allman's crucial contributions on the Layla CD. However, the core quartet(Clapton, Whitlock, Radle &amp; Gordon) were on their own for the subsequent 1970 tour. The Allmans' spirit was certainly there on the concert stage. In 1973, they released the album IN CONCERT, which is the main source of this more recent box set. Although the 1973 release met little fanfare (the band had already broken up 2 years prior), a listen revealed that this album rivaled the intensity and beauty of the Allman's Fillmore East classic album, which was recorded around the same time. Both albums contain extraordinary guitar solos, extemsive drum solos, essential blues reworkings, and plainly intense jamming. In the early '90s, both albums were remixed and similarly repackaged by Polydor: The Allman's FILLMORE CONCERTS and Dominoes' LIVE AT THE FILLMORE. Each box sets contained new liner notes, extra tracks. Everything sounds brilliant in its remastered glory. Eric Clapton and his American bandmates were at the top of their game when they came to the Fillmore in October 1970. This extraordinary box set faithfully preserves the mind-boggling complete live show they presented.<BR>Very few people actually had a chance to attend a Dominoes concert, so this double CD certainly shows the rest of us what it was like.
B000000OTY|5.0|To me and I know many others, Peter Gabriel's music is something you just lay your hands on sight unseen (or ears unheard) and you know it will please. This is a good example.  <br />I have been to so many concerts in my lifetime, one day I need to write them all down. I know this sounds overly dramamtic and I am not a very spritual person but before you die, go to a Peter Gabriel concert!  You will walk out a different person.
B00005NW02|5.0|In a year that has had radical ups and downs in the music industry, from the ... of bands like Drowning Pool and Saliva.  We've also gotten a handful of classic albums from some great bands (Radiohead, Opeth, Sigur Ros) and a few great surprizes (Fantomas, Primer 55) but Toxicity out shines all of them.  <br />System of a Down is the one band where you have to have diverse musical tastes to pin point their influences.  Faith No More, Frank Zappa, and the obvious Middle Eastern themes are still present from their S/T debut, but with Toxicity they've also developed their own sound.  The guitar work is magic, just amazing chord progressions through out the whole album.  Daron also does a great job with back up vocals.  From his high pitched croon to his death vocals, he contrasts Serj perfectly.  Shavo's bass work is great too, ranging from Tool like plucks to adding extra thickness to the guitars.  The drumming is intense and pin point in every song too.  Serj has turned into one of the best front men of the 90's, his range is great.  He uses a tiny bit of death vocals here and there but has one of the most original singing voices I've ever heard.  Songs like ATWA, Deer Dance, Chop Suey!, and well just about all of them show off his variation too.  He also writes some great lyrics ranging from political (Prison Song, Deer Dance) to hilarious (Bounce, Shimmy, Psycho) to powerful (Chop Suey!, Aerials) hey spouts off his variation in this field every chance he gets too.<br />The album is nit together extremly well and has a certine amount of flow with it.  Prison Song is a great opener with it's great riffs and variation.  Deer Dance is a stand out track with a cool message and a great ending.  Jet Pilot shows of an almost thrash edge with cryptic lyrics.  Chop Suey! is a good choice of single with it's soft and heavy passages and even a tad of strings to it.  Science has great guitars, and Psycho is one of the more interesting songs on the album.  But the best songs areAerials, ATWA, and Toxcity.  ATWA has a very mellow pre chorus but has some of the heaviest moments on the cd with it's chorus, and Aerials is just beautiful with rad lyrics and a cool outro.  Toxcity has great lyrics and the as we come to expect great chorus.  <br />This is THE album which is going to influence the next generation of music.  So go buy it now what's keeping you?
6300184064|5.0|Brazil. All the other reviews say it is so artful and depressing and dark humor and on and on. I'm glad none of the reviews give the ending away, and i don't want to put down the other reviews.  Watch this movie with an open mind. I read so many reviews before I watched the movie i think it may have ruined it a little by making my expectations too high (still my favorite movie, though). Don't expect Brazil to be some visual masterpiece with a thought-provoking plot and a suprise ending. Just watch it, maybe you'll find that it really is.  <BR>By the way.  For the parent, it is rated R for mild violence, very mild sexuality, and very mild language (in my opinion it could've been PG-13).  Keep in mind I'm not the official source to look to for movie ratings.<BR>Hope this movie turns out to be everything you DIDN'T expect it to be!
B00005NW02|5.0|oh my God. this cd is a work of pure genius and is far better than their brilliant debut. the songs here are alot more melodic with more of a singing emphasis, but still has very heavy music backing the vocals up. fav songs are prison song,deer dance,chop suey,science,and toxicity. go pick this cd up now if you are a true metal fan. lets hope these guys stick around for a long time to come.
B0000584V3|5.0|one word &quot;AMAZING&quot;
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Although I loved the movie I was disappointed in the CD because some of the songs from the movie, such as SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR and LIKE A VIRGIN, were not on the soundtrack while less likable songs that weren't in the movie were on the CD.  Also, the songs on the CD have been altered from the movie version.  I strongly prefer the movie to the CD and recommend going to the theatre if it's still showing in your area.  I went 5 times because the CD just doesn't do the music justice, and because the movie's so dang funny.
B00005A46T|4.0|This album is absolutely Wicked! Although i have to say the first one is marganly better. There are a few definate stand-out tracks on this one;<BR>People = Sh!t - Very good loud build up to one of the darkest albums the world has seen.<BR>Disasterpeice - Again, loud as f**k and a bit faster than the above.<BR>The Heretic Anthem - An absolute classic track<BR>Left Behind - A brilliant mixture of loud screams and soft singing on this one, the best track by a mile.<BR>Metabolic - Slow trobbing build up until it explodes into sound.<BR>These are just a few of the tracks on this classic album, but be warned, if u didn't like the first one, u won't like this one either. It's hard to live up to such great songs as 'wait and bleed' and 'liberate' from the first one but the leaders of the maggot corps hav dun it again. Buy it now.
B000002J1U|5.0|This is my favorite Zeppelin album. Led Zeppelin hinted slightly at folk music prior to this. Page and Plant had their ears turned toward the electric traditional folk music of Fairport Convention and their stunning female singer, Sandy Denny. They became close friends with Denny, who was already a big fan of theirs and she would guest a year later on &quot;The Battle Of Evermore&quot;<BR>Led Zeppelin caught fans and critics off guard with this gem. It still retained the gritty blues influence, while being countered  with serene folk melodies. They took a traditional folk song, &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;, and made it rock intensely without losing the folk feel at all. &quot;Imigrant Song&quot; is true early heavy metal. &quot;That's The Way&quot; is one of the best ballads they ever did, and &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; rivals or surpasses any of their previous gut bucket blues.<BR>This album proved that there was much more to Led Zeppelin than being loud and over the top, but let's face it. No one was better at being loud and over the top than Led Zeppelin.
B00003CXAA|4.0|I think The Godfather and Godfather II are classic American films which should be owned by ever cinema-phile.  Unfortunately, the third movie was just awful.  So maybe you should buy the set for \\"completeness\\", but I'd recommend saving a bit of money, shelf space and nausea by getting the first two and passing on any collection that includes the third one.
B00003CXN4|1.0|Technically, the film was well done.  It did a good job of portraying the many facets of the drug problem.  But I had come off a streak of seeing several films that left me saying - wow! - now that was a good film, and telling friends about it.  THIS ONE WILL LEAVE YOU THINKING - THANK GOD I DIDN'T WATCH THIS WITH ANYONE.  I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.  I WILL HIDE IT FROM THE KIDS.  If you want to go to bed depressed - this is your film.
B000001EYO|4.0|I agree with one reviewer who'd buy a DVD player just to read the rest of the song credits! I ended up buying my own copy of the video AND the soundtrack. I too wish for a \\"Vol. II. There has been some flak of different music styles cobbled together, but that's the key to the movie's and soundtrack's charm. Captain Beefheart was a perfect choice; I would suspect \\"The Dude\\" had all his albums. Meredith Monk, Yma Sumac, and Henry Mancini tied in with the other characters beautifully. Could have done without \\"Gluck Das Mir Verblieb\\" as it dragged the pace too much...would much rather have had the Crowe version of Viva Las Vegas. Missed Santana and Creedance. The Van Zandt cover of \\"Dead Flowers\\" was the perfect touch. I'm grateful to have discovered \\"Moondog\\" through this soundtrack. If anyone should know what was playing when Dude finally had the showdown with the private detective please e-mail me!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I've seen hunderds of movies over the years, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I was bored with plot and the acting wasn't much better. The only positive thing I have to say about this movie was Jolie who looked great during the movie. Other than this avoid this movie at all cost and I regret giving my hard earned money to watch this.
0060930187|4.0|The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath was written in a modern contemporary setting.  The novel is based upon a young girl who slowly descends into a deep depression.  The world around her affects her living style causing her to not be able to function normally.  She begins having trouble eating and sleeping.  Throughout the book, she begins to have thougts of suicide, and soon after many attempts at it.  After an incident where she disappears for a week, she checks into several mental institutions.  Toward the end of the book, the author begins to forshadow her condition worsening and creating a more devastating disaster.  It is believed that most of the book was based on the authors own life.  Soon after the book was published, the author committed suicide herself.  The novel was often times confusing but shed light on many unknown aspects.  The reader is taken on a journey of drastic emotions.  This book is mainly targeted for high school students.
6301768809|5.0|Our family has the original vhs movie where it has like 20 30-second previews at the end of the movie and there is a weird Tubes video and stuff.  This is a great movie.  Action packed, thrills, and its cool.  Everyone of these movies are great.
B00000HZFP|5.0|If you are trying to decide which CD to buy-- the original live cast performance, or the film version-- go for the original cast. The film version is excellent, but the original cast version is absolutely amazing! It has more raw energy to it, not to mention more voices in the songs and a more overall 'rock' feel, thanks to Cheater's guitars, bass, and drums. John Cameron Mitchell is a much raunchier Hedwig on this version, and Miriam Shor's Yitzak is the perfect vocal complement to her. If that isn't enough to persuade you, this CD comes complete with unforgettable pictures and the words to all the songs. Also included in the booklet is a very intriguing and entertaining portrayal of Hedwig from a reporter who visits her dressing room for an interview.<br />In all, this album pays Hedwig the perfect and complete homage she so very much deserves and commands.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is one incredible album that has redifined the way that I judge metal.  Each piece is a masterpiece in its own right.  Steve Harris (Bass) Writes or cowrites most of the piece and he is a genius.  He puts together these pieces with such thought and depth that it blows my mind every time I listen to it.  I'll go over each song:<BR>1 - The Wickerman - Great opening track with good driving rythm.  I swear, every time I hear the end of the second pre-chorus \\"The shadow of a Wickerman is calling you his way\\" I can imagine myself right up there i the front row getting ready to sing the chorus of \\"Your time will come!\\"  It's awesome.<BR>2 - The Ghost of the Navigator - Acoustic intro, distorted power chords enter, a wonderful build up to a great song with good drumming by Nicko.<BR>3 - Brave New World - loosely based on the old book of the same name, this was a wonderful title track and describes the return of the original metal gods.  (Black Sabbath, I consider to be up there too)<BR>4 - Blood Brothers - This is slower with great vocals and a wonderful score of music written by Harris.<BR>5 - The Mercenary - Kind of Average, but cool vocals, not that deep, but it's still a good headbanging song, great metal.  Not [like some of today's stuff] - like practically all the bands in the 90's that were produced on big record labels, with one single that [was not good], and sold a million or five million copies but was forgotten the next day - Korn, Limp Bizkit (ok they put out a few albums, but they still [were not good].) etc.<BR>6 - Dream of Mirrors - This...is pure genius.  This I consider to be the greatest masterpiece of the album.  Ballad-like mysterious intro.  Very deep, great vocals, great guitar, great everything, I can't say enough.  There's a section in the middle with vocals telliing how he is \\"Lost..\\" with classic Maiden Galloping in the background on guitars, -wow. Even though it's 10 minutes, when it's over, you wish it kept going.  It's incredible.<BR>7 - The Fallen Angel - pretty good, punding vocals, great triplet feel to it and a pretty cool, almost-celtic-sounding intro riff.<BR>8 - Nomad - Sounds very Egyptian, not a favorite, but it has a real mellow interlude that's fun to listen to.<BR>9 - Out of The Silent Planet - Supposedly Criticizes society, with very deep vocals, and an awesome chorus that you never forget.  Only Dissapointment is the solo, it sounds like they just found some chords to play over and improved it in the studio, a hard thing to accomplish, but it still sounds like they didn't put any thought into the solo.  3rd Favorite on the Album.<BR>10 - The Epic of the album.  This is definitely a piece of great thought.  Reminds me of Hallowed Be Thy Name, except it ends in a slow section that builds to a heavy section with a great solo, once agin returning to the slowness stating the thougth provoking final line \\"The Thin Line Between Love in Hate\\"<br />This is a great, but different Maiden Album (almost progressive, but no overall theme which is closely followed) which is tied with my other favorite \\"Live After Death.\\"  I would recommend LAD for a first timer if you like live albums because it has all the greats, otherwise Piece of Mind is a great studio album.  Hope this review beneifits you in your exploration of Maiden, oh, and don't ever listen to that reviewer named \\"carmarthen\\" or sumthin like that, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
0671027573|4.0|I am such a fan of Ms. Howard's works and have read almost all of her books (that I have been able to find locally!). She has a wonderful sensuality in her writing that urges me to pick up a book after sitting on my shelf for a few months and relive the moments all over again.<br />There was a *lot* of chemistry with a nice dash of humor. I enjoyed the growing electricity between Jaine and Sam. The ending was a surprising twist too, which really caught me off-guard. (Despite the fact that I kept thinking this story was soooo predictable from page one...)<br />&quot;You think you know... but you have no idea.&quot;<br />This book wasn't her best work, IMO, but it had its moments!
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you've never heard of the term, &quot;concept album&quot; or love them just as much as I do, buy OK Computer. One of the best albums I've heard in months, OK Computer sums up many aspects of the robots that dehumanize us from insanity to paranoia. Of course the album seems to focus on androids but it could also be applied to todays technologies (as seeing that we don't really have androids avalible to us). With that great Radiohead style it really has some tunes that stick with you, if not the tunes then the message. Definetly different from the more recent Kid-A and/or Amnesiac, OK computer is by far my favorite Radiohead right now. Having been listening to it for 3 or more months now, I can definetly say that it will always be next to the CD player. It didn't grow on me like Amnesiac did but I knew the second I played, &quot;Airbag&quot; that I would love the album. I'm completely serious about that too. Get this album to try it out and don't just borrow it for a day, really listen to it and you'll love it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|... and the bewildering nightmare of life without it--therein lies the crux of &quot;Memento&quot;, a quietly brilliant film by Christopher Nolan. The film's opening credits, set over the image of a Polaroid photograph in the reverse process of developing itself, indicates the way the story will unfold--backwards. The cast is filled with first-rate actors, headed by Guy Pearce in a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby--driven, tormented, with a sallow, haunted visage that is maintained throughout the film-who suffers from a rare medical condition which has robbed him of short-term memory. He is on a relentless quest to find and kill the man who attacked and murdered his wife, and who is responsible for Leonard's memory malfunction. The &quot;rub&quot; is that Leonard can't possibly remember the identity of the assailant. Leonard is only able to track him down by the use of Polaroid photos scribbled with reminders, a few odd post-it notes, and, most chillingly, by tattooing clues to his body, including a constant reminder of the reason for his mission, emblazoned backwards across his chest, readable only by use of a mirror. (An aside: &quot;We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are&quot;, says Leonard at the end of the film-but the film's question to the audience seems to be: what does that mirror reflect? And can we always believe in the truth of that reflection?) While some may find the vigilante aspect of the main character abhorrent, the audience's empathy for Leonard is gained by the poignancy of his plight. In one heart-wrenching scene, Leonard, while burning some of his wife's belongings, wonders if he has ever similarly disposed of her things before and thinks: &quot;I can't remember to forget you.&quot; &quot;Memento&quot; is an astonishing homily about guilt and vengeance (and is vengeance ever really attainable?), manipulation and betrayal, and the lies we often force ourselves to believe when we fall into our own self-inflicted episodes of short-term memory. NOTE: Those with short-attention spans need not apply! This film demands from its audience absolute attention from beginning to end.
0792106989|5.0|&quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; tells the story of a young and wild west, where the gun is the law, and law and order is either scoffed at, or coward behind; and where eastern ideals of cvility are fastly encroaching upon this expanse of untamed land.<BR>Jimmy Stewart plays the young lawyer, Rance Stoddard, fresh out of law school, determined to tame the wild west with law and justice, rather than with a gun. On his way west, the stagecoach he is on is stopped by an band of outlaws, run by Liberty Valance, played by Lee Marvin. Stewart, badly beaten by Valance, is found on the trail by Tom Donophin, played by John Wayne, and is brought to the little town of Shinbone. There, he is cared for by young and beautiful Haley, played by Vera Miles. She is Tom's girl, or so he thinks; but he won't ask her to marry him until he can finish the house he is building, and earn enough money to support her. Stewart is determined to bring Valance to Justice, and is scoffed by Donophin when he tells how. Only a gun will stop Valance, Donophin says. The town marshall, played by Andy Devine, cowars when he hears the name of Liberty Valance, and hasn't the courage to put the outlaw behind bars. In the meantime, Stoddard heals from his wounds, and sets up a school in the back of newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody's, office. He hopes to instill the value of law and order, and common civility, in the townfolk, and persuade them that guns will only lead to more violence. While Donophin is away on business, the relationship between Stoddard and Haley deepens, much to Donophins dismay when he returns. Talk of Statehood is debated, and feircely fought over. Valance works for the cattlemen, who do not want to see statehood; and when he vies for a seat in congress, he vows revenge against Stoddard when he is rejected by the town. The ultimate showdown proves that in Shinbone, out west, at least for the time being, law and order can only be solved by a gun. Stoddard and Valance face for a final duel. But - who really kills Valance? Donophin reveals to Stoddard that he did it; but did he really, or did he tell him that merely to ease the young lawyer's conscience? Regardless of &quot;who shot Liberty Valance&quot;, with this ruthless bandit dead, law and order, morals and ethics, and common ideals and civility may enter Shinbone, and spread across the land, reaching ever further into the lawless west.
B000000OAA|4.0|Being chronologically between Queen II and A Night at the Opera, It's easy to see why it doesn't have the due respect. Both are the two best Queen albums. But this one is marvellous too. Several different feelings, from &quot;stone cold crazy&quot;, an almost heavy metal song, to the beautiful simplicity of &quot;in the lap of the gods&quot;, to &quot;bring back that leroy brown&quot;, which I 'm not sure if it's Dixieland, traditional jazz, or what. I know that it's great only. I'm a great Queen fan and I like this very much.
B00003CXSP|1.0|This movie stinks.  Anyone who liked it has no taste.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Buy this DVD!  You will thank me later.<br />This is truly a great movie.  The best movie I have seen all year.  Maybe the best movie I have seen in about two years.  Guy Pearce is excellent in this movie.  If you don't know who he is he was in L.A. Confidential with Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger a few years back.  (Also another great move.)<br />Guy plays Leonard (don't call him Lenny), a man with no short term memory.  Due to the fact that he cannot remember conversations that took place less than five minutes ago, he uses a series of notes and photographs to remind himself of events and people.  He also tattoos himself with important facts that he does not want to forget.<br />I won't give much away because you really have to go into this movie with a clear mind.  As you have probably already read or heard elsewhere the movie goes in reverse.  It starts at the end of the story and ends at the beginning.  This makes for a very interesting plot device.  Yet it does not make the movie difficult to watch.  <br />The thing I loved most about this film was that there were really no answers, no resolution.  Things were left open to interpetation of the viewer.  I still find myself thinking about this movie all the time.  I look forward to watching it several more times to see what further interpetations I can gleam from this great movie.  This movie will be a classic.
B00005NW02|5.0|System's brutally heavy, daringly experimental, angelically melodic second album is in a class of its own. The opening track &quot;Prison Song&quot; grabs your attention and gets you an immediate adrenaline pump. You'll find yourself singing this song after a couple of listens. &quot;Needles&quot;, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, &quot;Bounce&quot; and &quot;Arto&quot; also stand out in this album. Hook laden riffs abound in this album -- typical SOAD. SOAD is not just another heavy band -- they have something new to offer.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this CD.  It is one of my all time favorites.  The thing that is so great about it, is that every single song on the CD is good.  You don't have to skip over songs or anything.  This CD is so good you can eat it (cheesy, I know).
6301967984|5.0|I think Salo is a master work.  Sure, it is stagnant and slow in the European tradition of film making, but that is not a citicism of the film itself, merely how we in the US read the language of film.<br />Yes, there are disgusting moments in this film, but I consider those moments as horror the must be witnessed - an object lesson.  ...

0380733358|5.0|This book started Ken Follet's career as a bestselling novelist, and deservedly so...it's an amzing piece of work. Tight plotting, an entirely believable historical premise that even ties together some of WW2's &quot;loose ends&quot;, sizzling romance, three-dimensional characters, one of the best chase sequences I've ever read, and a finale so filled with suspense and driving mayhem that it brings &quot;The Terminator&quot; to mind...but with real people and real situations. Read it when you have some uninterrupted time...you won't be able to put it down!
B000002BSG|5.0|This album is made of solid gold, the acid-jazzy-funky vibes of this album, the third of the Jamiroquai odyssey, will surely put you booty to dace right away, the album sounds and interpretative lyrics make you feel as if you were travelling along with the songs to the places they describe, absolutely a must-have for your collection, of course, if you like EXCELLENT music.
0748662979|5.0|Morality for Beautiful Girls is third in a series about Precious Ramotswe, a lady detective in Botswana, Africa. For this Midwestern reader the landscape, weather, and daily life in Botswana were fascinating and clearly depicted. <br />This is not your typical mystery--there is no murder to be solved. Ramotswe and her assistant detective cleverly handle a couple of cases for clients, but her personal life is just as interesting: moving the office, caring for two foster children, and handling the auto repair shop belonging to her fiance who has suddenly begun acting strangely. Ramotswe deals with both the problems of her clients and her personal life in a thorough and straight-forward manner.<br />I had to buy the first two books in the series (The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency, and Tears of the Giraffe) from Amazon.UK, so I was very happy to find this third book on Amazon.com. <br />For something just a little different--highly recommended.
B00005B4GU|2.0|No doubt that KID A was a contraversial work. Personally, I enjoyed it, but many thought it was pure heavy-handed rubbish put out by an ever-elitist art rock group. Well, I have faith in Radiohead still, but they definitely went too far with AMNESIAC. It is simply a failed experiment in soundscaping. God bless Radiohead for having the chutzpuh to try this in the first place, but &quot;bold&quot; albums are not necessarily good ones, especially when you have standards as stratospheric as Radiohead's. <br />Ultimately, AMNESIAC lacks energy and melody, two traits at which Radiohead normally excel. I thought that, with an added emphasis on lyric, AMNESIAC might top the lyrically punile KID A. Yes, the poetry is indeed more complete here, but at the expense of the music. Give me KID A anyday. Better yet, gimme THE BENDS, which is damn near perfect if you ask me.<br />Not that AMNESIAC doesn't have it's brighter points (well, &quot;bright&quot; in the loose Radiohead sense): &quot;Packt Like Sardines...&quot; and &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; are adventurous tracks with tight melodic substance. It was also good to hear Radiohead end off with another foray into jazz/swing. These solid bookends, however, can't save an excessively dreary and uninspired work. Try again, boys.
0451169514|5.0|Although it's the longest Stephen King book I've read, the extra time was worth it. This book is about 7 kids from Maine who encounter a vicious evil that has held their town hostage since before mankind was created. Every 27 years, It appears as a victim's greatest fear, kills them, and drags them into the sewers, where It lives and sleeps. Each cycle lasts 18 months, and can take dozens of children. The kids believe that they've killed It, but 27 years later they are called back. It's awoken. There is so much detail and passion in this writing that you don't want to stop for even a moment. Definitely a must-read.
B00003CXA2|5.0|As everyone already knows, the story of Forrest Gump is timeless and something that will be viewed for generations to come.  The DVD has done a great job in preserving its great quality.  First, the picture quality is superb.  The colors and definition are crisp.  Take a look and you'll notice great clarity in each scene.  The 5.1 sound is decent.  It doesn't employ all 5 channels of sound to the fullest extent, but it'll do for most people.<br />Now for the special features.  Disc 1 offers great, comprehensive commentaries by the producers and the director, Robert Zemeckis.  While other directors provide useless information, this commentary is actually informative and pertinent to what's shown on screen.  Disc 2 is simply amazing.  Do you want to know how Forrest Gump was made and then some?  Disc 2 is all you need.  Considering how great the special effects were, this set of bonus features are very welcome and entertaining.  <br />If you own an the older, original copy of the Forrest Gump DVD, set it aside and get this new one.  It's worth the money.  If you don't own Forrest Gump, get it now.  Not only is the movie great but Disc 2 provides an amazing set of bonuses that other DVD's should live up to.
1559409010|5.0|If you're a fan of Monty Python, the the Criterion Edition is the only way to see the Life of Brian. Hilarious commentary by the Pythons, the original theatrical trailer, beautifully outlandish radio ads, rare deleted scenes, and a documentary all make up the extras that make it a DVD well worth every penny. The movie itself looks as great as it ever did, with all the hilarious hijinx of this Biblical comedy marvelously preserved for all time on a single disc. It just doesn't get any funnier than this. This film is a hilarious attack on Liberalism and features the Pythons at their peak. What more can I say other than, &quot;Always look on the bright side of life.&quot;
B00005JIZA|4.0|I would really give a 4.5 stars, but thats not an option.  A 5 star cd is hard to come by, but this is good.  I hope to see him live soon-it's intersting to see how the music transfers to that setting.  If you like good music, give this a listen!
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes, is the profound heart-warming autobiography of Frank McCourt, an Irish who describes the harsh conditions, which he was forced to grow up in.  His story begins in the time of the Depression when he was born to his poor recent immigrant parents, Angela and Malachy in Brooklyn.  Frank is brought up in a home with siblings that he is forced to take care of and watch die.  He must be his mother's strength as she waits for her drunken husband to come home every night with out food.  Little Frank continues to have hope as he travels to his parent's homeland of Ireland.  As his dreams of a rich life in his new home diminish due to his father's continual drunkenness he finds optimism in his new siblings who he believes are brought to him by an Angel to the Seventh Step in his run down home, and through his father's tales of Cuchulian, who saved Ireland.  Every week Angela is forced to beg to a council for food and clothing.  Because of the overwhelming poverty in their small town Frank learns to live with shoes repaired with tires, a pig's head for Christmas dinner, and having to take two jobs to provide for his family.<BR> This book is recommended because of the genius of Frank McCourt's writing. He is able to capture the essence of a poor Irishman's life with humor, satire, and strife, while at the same time telling a touching story.  As he writes of his everyday life the accents and culture of the Irish can be felt.  McCourt also brings out all emotions from laughing at his father who would make him and his brother wake up to tell his \\"Pride for Ireland\\" to crying as Malachy holds his dead daughter in his arms due to lack of medical attention.  This book also opens eyes to the life of poverty, and the obstacles that are overcome.  Before reading this account I was never aware of the struggles that people must go to if they do not have money.  The fact that Angela was forced to get down on her hands and knees and had to beg for money to go to the doctor ispreposterous.  I was educated and my eyes were opened to a whole new world as I read the horrific details of having to live in solely the upstairs of the house because of flooding.<BR> At the same time that this book was entertaining and heartfelt, it is incredibly depressing.  Learning about the grim realities of Frank McCourt's childhood was extremely difficult.  I often would have to put the book down because of the immense details we would get into about his life.  For example, when his father finally got a job in England and was supposed to send money home.  The whole family would wait by the door for the postman to come baring money.  Day after day there would be no money.  Reading about the hunger they were forced to go to because of a father's addiction, really stings the heart.<BR> Angela's Ashes is the best portrayal of the difficult life uneducated poor people lead in order to survive, while at the same time providing insight into the Irish culture, and creating a moving, earnest story.
B00005A46T|3.0|I really liked slipknot's first album, really grinding guitars, somewhat complicated arrangements, and catchy lyrics. However this album has missed the mark. This album goes to fill the noisy rap-rock genre with drop tuned guitars, with whiny singing that eventually evolves into growling. They should have just stayed with the formula they had in the first album. I have a real bad feeling that they will end up like Korn and most of the other rap rockers, they all release a really good first album-a really tight arrangement, good melodies and songs- but then every follow up album is crap. If you want to hear some really good metalcore-the orgin of this genre which originated in the late 80's early 90', get some Anthrax(&quot;persistence of time&quot;) or Biohazard(&quot;urban discipline&quot;) which is real metal(no drop tuning or whiny growls). I guarantee you will not be disappointed with these two alternative suggestions.
B00005M4JS|5.0|Chocolat has got to be one of the best movies you could see. It has everything a good movie needs; a wonderful director, great music, great scenes, and above all a stupendous cast. Juliette Binoche stars as Vianne, the chocolatier who moves restlessly from place to place with her daughter Anouk (played by a six-year old whose name eludes me at the moment). Judi Dench plays the old crotchety woman who rents a patisserie and apartment to Vianne. Lena Olin shows just how accomplished she is, playing a woman who is abused by her husband. (Very different from her character in &quot;A Polish Wedding.&quot;) Alfred Molina is hilarious as the town's mayor, who (at first) seems to be very pious. And Johnny Depp is marvelous as the Irish gypsy guitar-playing &quot;river rat&quot;, Roux. I was actually quite surprised that Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench didn't win Best Actress for their portrayals of Vianne and Armande. They were truly wonderful every moment on-screen.<BR>Over all, there is no movie that is quite like &quot;Chocolat.&quot; It's not a comedy (although there are some funny parts) nor is it a tragedy. It's just a pure sweet movie.
B00005NW02|5.0|This is definitley the best cd of 2001, and prob one of the best ever.  The cd flows great, every song is excellent and well placed from \\"Prison Song\\" to \\"Aerials.\\"  This intelligent, hard-rocking opus is a must!
0380973650|4.0|Although the ending is anticlimatic, especially to those familiar with Shirley Jackson and &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, this novel is a great trip. The characters, especially our hero, are multi-faceted and entertaining. Not a simple formula, paint by number effort. You will have an interesting time.
B00005A46T|3.0|man, this album is a huge letdown.  i really like their first and listen to it all the time so naturally i was excited to run out and buy iowa.  then i listened and didn't really like it so well, but i thought that if i gave it some more listening to i would start to like it better, as some good albums are, it takes a couple of days to get the feel of it.  <BR>not iowa though.  it's ok but definatly not near as good as the first.  dumb lyrics and rehashed riffs don't make for a good album.
0375707972|3.0|As with a lot of the novels I've read by Eastern European writers this book does not spend much time on useless adjectives or flowery language.  Instead the story is brisk and well formed.  Could have used a bit more character development to enhance the psychological drama of the situation (which seemed to be the crux of the story).  Overall a good (short) read that hung with me for a few days.
0780626966|5.0|One of the best series of Horror movies are all together in one little box, all remasted and no famous rental &quot;fuzziness&quot;! Freddy Krueger is a revolutionist in the Horror genre. The first two were &quot;horror&quot; movies, but the rest that followed became &quot;black comedies&quot;. Which is okay because it's Freddy Krueger because he can get away with it. You won't see Jason doing some comedy... wait. He did do Friday the 13th Part 8... nevermind. If you're a fan of Horror movies, then you must own this DVD box set.
B00005IC2H|4.0|How cool is it that a band as big as Sigur Ros picks a band as excellent as The Album Leaf to support them on their U.S. tour!!??<br />Despite the indie cred factor, Sigur Ros' musical soundscapes drift you away into another universe that is filled with warmth and sonic pleasure. I have no idea what the singer is saying but to me his voice is just another instrument -- similar to the way that My Bloody Valentine used vocals as a means to create more diverse instrumentation.<br />If you like Sigur Ros then you may like The Album Leaf too -- check 'em both out on tour.
B00000JQFL|5.0|Being one of the best selling soul bands of the 1970s, it's not hard to imagine the large arenas that Earth, Wind &amp; Fire were filling at the time of these recordings. This superb album, originally released as a double-LP but now issued on a single CD, captures the excitement they generated on stage at their creative peak, and is probably the closest that younger fans such as myself who were not around back in heyday will get to being able to experience the sunny and uplifting vibe that so obviously was in the air. The horn-powered funk grooves of 'Yearnin Learnin' and 'Shining Star' seem to just explode with their communal spirit, especially when coupled with the enthusiastic audiences they were playing to. And when they delve into beautiful and inspirational slow jam classics like 'Devotion' and a stellar and absolutely priceless performance of 'Reasons' which boasts not only Phillip Bailey's stunning, other-worldly vocals, but a memorable alto sax solo by guest Don Myrick, I can guarantee you there would not be a dry eye in the entire crowd. The final quarter of this album is comprised of studio recordings that were completed before this tour and those songs harness their own explosive energy, as is evidence on the moody and emotional classic 'Can't Hide Love' and, one of my personal favorites, the sunny, summertime happiness anthem 'Sing a Song', which is impossible to listen to without smiling.<br />I do not hesitate in saying that 'Gratitude' is one of EWF's finest accomplishments, and even the most casual fan should not deprive themselves of it. I would have crawled on my hands and knees to a concert of their's back in their '70s funk heyday, and this album displays their dynamic stage show as excellently as you could hope for. The genius mind and vision of Maurice White may lead this musical ensemble, but he never acts as if it belongs to him anymore than it belongs to the next guy. He wanted it to belong to everyone. Listen to him as he yells back to thecrowd &quot;We love y'all too&quot; and leads everyone in clappin' their hands and singin' out for love. He wanted every single person in those arenas to feel it, to feel the vibes and the good energy that he and the crew were putting off. This was back in a time when it was really about the music. Music that lifted people's spirits and brought people together. Almost anyone you talk to will tell you that as captivating as EWF's original albums are, there is absolutely nothing like being at one of their live shows. After hearing this album, you will believe just as I do.
B00004T0UT|5.0|After making movies in Hollywood during the '60s, Elvis returned to being the Undisputed King of Rock And Roll! This album was Elvis' best since &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;. The 1969 sessions were rockin' and Elvis was glad to quit Hollywood, and go back to live performances and leisurely recording! You'll absolutely love this! With extra tracks added this is even better ever since this album was first released over 30 years ago.
B000002LAC|5.0|I live in Tucson and so does Linda Ronstadt. From rock to Spanish ballads, Linda sings it all with pride in her Hispanic roots. Dolly Parton has the truest soprano voice in music today and possesses the ability to sing a variety of music types. Emmylou Harris sings from the soul, simple and plain. TRIO displays the talents of each singer, melded in a harmony; so feminine, so powerful and so heartfelt. This album's musical selections are well thought out for the best mix. I like the album's overall balance. I find it easy to identify with the songs on TRIO. Sing on,you TRIO of Angels. I'll listen from earth!
0767830520|1.0|My wife and I found this video to be very boring because there was no plot, poor dialogue, and even the score was monotonous. We viewed it in Sept, 2001, which is 25 years after the movie release. Maybe when it was released it had something to say but it does not hold up to time. Great movies have great dialogue.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|THIS IS A CLASSIC LIVE ALBUM EVER...WHEN ROCK WAS ROCK N ROLL, NOT THE JUNK BANDS THAT ARE OUT TODAY....UFO LIVES!BUY THIS CD AND ENJOY ONE OF THE BEST BANDS EVER.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I bought this CD for the song &quot;Thank You&quot;.  I figured that would be the only song that I would like.  I was very wrong.  I love her introspective lyrics and haunting melodies.  It is a CD that gets better every time you listen to it.
B00003CY3W|1.0|What a horrible, horrible movie.  Here we have the sory of Enid, a girl who everyone is calling a &quot;counter culture rebel&quot; but should be labeled &quot;lazy, worthless slacker&quot;.  Enid's problem is that she doesnt fit into todays society so she believes that she is better than them because she listens to lesser known music, dresses like a euro-teen prostitute and dyes her hair on a whim.  Enid has just graduated.. ermmm strike that... has almost graduated (art class conflicted with slacking but since slacking comes first, she failed the class) and has unleashed herself upon the world!  Whoops!  Enid failed to realize that her slacking powers only work in school where others may label her &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;rebellious&quot;.  In the real world, Enid has the skills of a drunken lab rat and her powers are not effective because she has failed to persue her obvious life-long career track as a part-time record store employee.  Somehow Enid has made a friend in a girl named Rebecca and they have had a dream of moving out and getting an apartment after graduation.  Rebecca wishes she could be like Enid but fails when she realizes that in order to reach her dream of moving out, she has to get a job, which she gets... at Starbucks.  Enid wants to get a job but it interferes with her tasks of following strange people and potential Satanists and since she is so clever and witty she cannot keep the simplest of jobs because &quot;its not her&quot;.  One day she decides that she wants to meet someone thats a bigger loser than herself so Enid jokingly responds to a personal ad placed by a man named Seymore.  Enid has Seymore show up at a diner so that Rebecca and herself can see what kind of person can place that sort of ad.  Needless to say Enid, Rebecca and Josh (a boy who Enid likes but cant tell him that in fear of invoking the mighty wrath of her best friend) follow Seymore home, root through his mail and eventually stalk him until he unwittingly lets Enidinto his life.  Let the hijinks ensue!!!  Enid believes she can set Seymore up with a date but then wonders why he never takes her out... I dont know... maybe the fourty year age difference.  She gives school a second chance but when the teacher turns out to be an idiot, she decides to bring herself to that level and not only ends up turning Seymore's life into hell but also sparks the entire town's rage.  Could of been avoided if she showed up on time to speak to the mob like she was supposed to be but hey, slacking requires you to be two hours late to any social event. Oh yeah, she eventually dumps on Rebecca as well (who has somehow gotten an apartment in a nice neighborhood with no credit history and on part-time Starbuck's pay! I'm applying there tomorrow.  I'd do it today, but I'm slacking.)  Dont worry, in the end Enid realizes that she's a big turd, comes to her senses and makes everything right for herself and her friends.  Oh wait, that would make sense and potentially be the right thing to do so no.  Enid runs away looking for somewhere thats exactly like her. A place that would embrace her slackerness, wittiness and inability to think of other people's feelings.  Wait, dont they kick you out of high school after a certain age?  <br />Everybody is sporting a 3/4 chub because Terry Zwigoff directed this steamer.  Thats right, Terry Zwigoff.  Terry Zwigoff.  You know, the guy who directed the documentary &quot;Crumb&quot;.  &quot;Crumb&quot;.  What?  You havent heard of that?  Well it's about this centuries Marquis de Sade who instead of writes his naughty tales, he draws them in comic book form.  I'm not knocking Robert Crumb, but come on.  One documentary does not make Terry Zwigoff a good movie director, as seen in this film.... many times over.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|You know, the more I go to the movies, the more I appreciate watching them at home. At home, I don't have to deal with screaming kids, idiots who think it's the height of coolness to project their laser pointers on the screen or talkin' on their cell phones every five minutes, and schmendricks who think they're standing in for Joel/Mike and the `Bots from MST3K. With wonderful little distractions like this, is it any wonder I prefer to stay indoors to maximize my cinematic enjoyment?<br /><br />This, the first of the modern cinematic `Batman' outings, became a case in point. In a strange fit of masochistic insanity, I decided to catch a midnight matinee re-release of `Batman' at the local bijou. I was in luck for a while- people were behaving themselves. Then came the moment where Eckhardt, a cop on the take, gets shot down by Jack Napier (the guy who becomes the Joker).<br /><br />William Hootkins, the man who played the portly and corrupt cop, is also famous among pop-culture sci-fi aficionados as Porkins, the first X-wing pilot to get shot down during the climactic Death Star battle in `Star Wars'. Ironically, this character's last words were, \\"I'm all right, I'm all--Aaaaagggghhh!\\", which were the very words I heard a group of uber-Warsies yell out when he caught a bullet in `Batman'. You know, I like the `Star Wars' flicks as much as the next geekin' fanboy, but not to the point that I'll annoy other folks with my high-decibel verbatim recitations of an actor's lines from another movie. It's kinda gauche, you know?<br /><br />But, aside from that, I rather enjoy this little slice o' comic-book celluloid. Jack Nicholson's Joker is one of his most nutso performances ever! Actually, that's not saying too much, is it? I mean, you take a look at `The Shining', `The Witches of Eastwick', or `One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', and it's pretty obvious that Nicholson isn't exactly challenged by roles involving psychos and evil incarnate. Still, he makes the Joker over-the-top without going overboard, unlike the villains from the Joel Schumacher-directed Bat-flicks!<br /><br />I'll be one to admit that Michael Keaton doesn't exactly look the part as Bruce Wayne... which I learned was what director Tim Burton wanted (he states in one of the behind-the-scenes shows that he wanted the Bruce Wayne character to look like he HAD to dress up to be scary to criminals). But as Batman, it's a completely different story. Neither Val Kilmer nor George Clooney could ever hope to match that chin! Of course, if Jay Leno were to ever accept the role...<br /><br />Speakin' of special features: as I stated earlier, there's a big ol' freakin' butt-load of stuff to look through here. I started off with the feature-length commentary track by director Tim Burton-- which I stopped listening to about ten minutes in, `cuz I was zoning out to his incessant droning about... something or other. Okay, so the commentary track was a bust; no biggie. To be honest, I'm not all that thrilled by most DVD special features; after watching several zillion behind-the-scenes mini-docs and retrospectives, I've gotten more than a little jaded by it all. Still, for the sake of putting together as thorough a review as possible, I gotta make a few sacrifices...<br /><br />Anyhoo, there's a whole ton o' behind-the-scenes featurettes, retrospectives, and even a history of Batman in comic books featuring interviews by such comic book luminaries as Paul Dini, Alex Ross, Frank Miller, and Kevin Smith, as well as the late, great Batman creator Bob Kane. While I usually find most behind-the-scenes docs kinda dull, many of the shows on the bonus platter had some reasonably interesting moments. Especially entertaining were the movie's principals discussing how \\"iconic\\" and \\"archetypal\\" their respective roles were, and how the roles \\"related to their comic book counterparts.\\" This whole love-fest got to be so nauseating that I almost \\"barfed.\\"<br /><br />Also covered were looks at the special effects, as well as the building of the bat-suit and batmobile. Quite frankly, I found some of the effects in this particular go-`round a tad less than special, especially Joker's fall off the cathedral. But others worked out pretty well, albeit not totally perfect.<br /><br />Also covered are profiles on the film's main heroes and villains, with retrospective interviews by the principals who played the parts. They even did a profile on the Joker's trusty sidekick, Bob the Goon (as played by Tracy Walter)... who is my all-time fave bad-guy sidekick. Well, aside from General Disarray, faithful aide to the scourge of South Park Professor Chaos, that is.<br /><br />All in all, the 2-disc special edition release of the first Batman flick gives you about as thorough a look at the history, development, and making of the movie as you can get! `Course, if you're not into the extra stuff, the movie itself looks pretty danged good... a little better than the original DVD release, even!<br /><br />`Late!were looks at the special effects, as well as the building of the bat-suit and batmobile.

B000005HN6|5.0|Absolute brilliance. No band in the 90's can compare to the godly band known as &quot;Opeth&quot;. They are simply the greatest band in music today...The melodies are beautiful, the growling is a very nice compliment to the guitar harmonies on this debut release...and my god, this is their debut...tell me another band who's debut is this original and incredible...This album should not be sold in stores, it deserves some work to get it, it must be ordered...Anyone looking for some really heavy, yet melodic music with alot of acoustic passages, check out this cd. You won't regret it, and if you do, you're not human...ORRRRRDDDEEERRRR IIITTTTT!!!!!!and once you have that, order Morningrise...then get the other masterpieces.
0671024256|5.0|I loved this book! I was given this book as a present, and must admit that I am probably one of the only people that has NEVER read a Stephen King novel. Thus, I approached it tentatively at first, but quickly found that I could not put it down... and realized just how articulate Mr. King is.<br />King makes no promises to transform you into an excellent writer. He likens write to unearthing an archeologic dig, and claims he doesn't even know how the story will end while he is writing it.<br />The book is divided into a number of sections, reflecting his life. The first of which is titled &quot;CV&quot; and is a thoroughly delightful look into how King got to where he is. It details his rejection slips as well as his first successes... and does a nice job of showing the influences that pushed him into the &quot;Stephen King&quot; world.<br />The second section is the meat and potatoes on his writing suggestions. The books insights into making dialogue and character descriptions interesting is invaluable. He even takes the time to show an example of a first draft chapter, and then his exact hand written changes for the rewrite. I found this to be extremely illuminating.<br />His final section is on life. Perhaps the books biggest gem for me was in illuminating the man. I came away from this book with two realizations. The first, by his examples of how he writes, was just how much of a genius he truly is in his field. The second, by the honesty expressed in this book, is just what a great man he truly is... he comes across as the kind of guy a person would love to have as a friend... in other words - he is very &quot;real&quot; and warm in his description of his problems with drugs, and a nearly fatal car accident.<br />I cannot help but recommend this book as one of the most enjoyable I have read this year.

B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot; on the radio and was very surprised. It seemed to me that every song on the CD was good, but after listening to it again I found that I was right. For your convenience, I've rated every song on the CD, the highest rating 10 and the least 0 (but trust me, there's nothing close to a 0)<br />Papercut: Catchy beat with fast pased lyrics. A good way to start off the CD. 8<br />One Step Closer: I think by now it's a surprise if you haven't heard this one. Although a good song, its constant play on the radio makes it get old rather quick. 7<br />With You: The lyrics themselves are a good blend of rap and rock, but the chorus is slightly annoying. Overall though, a fairly good song. 8<br />Points of Authority: Awsome song. This is when Chester really shows his vocal talents. The catchy playing off of each other at the end of the song really ties it together. 9<br />Crawling: What can you say about this one? Great rythem and amazing lyrics knock your socks off. 10<br />Runaway: A personall favorite. Smooth lyrics that are almost haunting make for a great addition. 10<br />By Myself: A good song that again uses rap in the lyrics, yet comes out with a slamming chorus makes for a good song. 8<br />In the End: So sad it brings tears to your eyes. Incredible! THe best song on the CD. 10<br />A Place For My Head: Another personal favortie, not so much for the words but for the guitar, which is excellent. One of the best. 10<br />Forgotten: With two vocallists playing off of each other, this song almost has you swaying from side to side. Starts right after track 9, so you don't have any time to take a breath. 10<br />Cure For An Itch: The first time I heard this I was like, &quot;what the hell is this?&quot; but after I listened to it a few more times, it really grew on me, and became one of my alltime favorites. Starts out weird, but then follows up with a stunning remix with pianno flitered in here and there. 10<br />Pushing Me Away. A great way to end off the CD. You can almost see the band waving good-bye to you. 10<BR>Overall, this CD has it all. I bought it the day I broke up with my girlfriend, and it really helped me through the loss. It seems like the band was able to tap into the things in your life that are sad and lonely. Overall, you'll love this CD and I hope these guys will remain around for a long, long time!
B00003CXZ4|1.0|memento is one of the movies i ever saw i can't believe it actually stole 25,000,000 from moviegoers it made no sense to me what so ever if want to waste the money then rent memento.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|I truly love this movie very much. I always have since I was thirteen. My mother had found the movie to be blasphemy, due to the references of Christian mythology towards the end of the movie. There was a scene where two ghostbusters talk about judgement day. I can still remember sneaking over to my friends to watch the movie. The one thing that makes this movie stand out, is that it had superheros who were average day guys. They were not buffed up like Rambo, and had no super powers. They were guys like me. See you always see attractive super models saving the world, but not in this movie. Nope in this one we get to see couch potatoes become saviours of the world. We get to see these average guys, start off just like us and become icons. This wonderful movie showed me that even a guy like me can stop an evil God. Oh and one more thing this is the God of one liners. (Back off man I'm a scientist) (Go get her ray!!) (Cats and dogs sleeping together, mass hysteria!!) <BR>You better go see this movie. It's a movie of biblical proportions.

Ok now I know it's not the most intelligent movie of all time, but to be honest that's the whole point. So if you're the kinda person who can take a break from classy stuff and have a little fun like a kid, then you'll love this. Don't get me wrong I love shakespear and Dickens,  but it's good to sometimes not be serous.  Oh and warning to some of you, there are a few violent scenes. The new cover makes it look more like a family movie. I would show it to my kids, if I had any but others may disagree. So if you got kids and are picky with what they view, watch it by yourself first. I know kids love the movie though, cause I remember how I felt.

0380817683|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I could not put it down.  I love how it turns out and the characters are great.  Try it out...you'll love it too..
B000059Z8J|5.0|Ok first of all this movie is great, no amazing! But I know for a fact that you picky and annoying little self proclaimed movie credits out there well hate it. I mean those picky little creeps, the ones who prob and prob for flaws. Ones who main purpose in life is to destroy the fun of everyone. You picky breed, will poke at the older special effects. You'll jab at obvious things like the fact there is no krypton. I know a guy who hates the movie just cause there is no such thing has flying men, or that's how he put it. Don't you hate people like that? Now I love this movie, cause it has such a strong story. It's filled with emotional scenes, from beginning to end. It probes at the inner desires, that hopefully most of us have, the urge of wanting the power to just stop the stuff we see on the news. Like when ever you see a shooting on tv, you just wish you could walk right up to the guys and pull their guns away. In this world of high school shootings, we need a good fantasy movie to escape too. And trust me  even though you know it's just a movie, every time someone gets saved in the movie, you'll have a big grin to match the size of Superman's.
B00005N5S5|5.0|James Cameron has to be one of the finest Directors of our time.  An elite perfectionist, he is one of the few who knows how to meticulously balance a love story smack dab in the middle of a Science Fiction action movie.  The story starts in modern day 1984 (not so modern anymore) where a cyborg has been sent back in time to destroy the birth mother of the machines greatest enemy so that their nemesis cannot be created.  Thankfully the girl has a common name and lives in Los Angeles where several women exist with the same name.  Being logical, the killer intends to take them all out.  One by one the women fall victim to this `serial killer' and Sarah, played by a younger Linda Hamilton, starts to think she's next...and she's right.  Enter the man to save her life, Kyle Reece, played intensly by Michael Biehn.  He's a soldier from the future who is sent back to protect her from this unfeeling machine.  The best part about these two coming through the portal from the furture is that they come through with nothing.  So they have to rely on what is already in 1984.  This eliminates many complex elements in the story, as well as some costlier special effects.  It keeps grounded a little more.  Since the weaponry they're forced to use is less sophisticated, the Terminator is harder to  kill.  Kyle and Sarah find themselves not only running for their lives but finding something more in each other.  This movie sounds like a cheesy love story within an action movie but there is a special chemistry between the two leads and Cameron juggles them all like a professional circus performer.  Both Hamilton and Biehn's character have a dire innocence about them.  Sarah has no idea that anything she ever does could be considered so important, and being told the reason why this machine is after her makes her world seem that much smaller.  Reece has never known deep emotions of love, and the only women he has ever known are tough soldier types.  Getting to know Sarah makes him really feel what he knows was in his heart already.<br />No one but Arnold could play the Cyborg Tank that stalks poor Linda Hamilton throughout the movie.  His unstoppablility is only outdone by his cold unfeeling exterior and deadly violent actions.  The chemistry between Biehn and Hamilton is strong and believeable.  The action scenes are intense and you always know what's going on.  I would highly recommend this film.  It set a standard for many other Sci Fi films, as well as gave birth to one of the greatest sequels of all time, Terminator 2, Judgement Day.
0452282152|5.0|Girl With A Pearl Earring<BR>The book Girl With a Pearl Earring, by Tracy Chevalier, is an insightful look into the life of the protagonist Griet. Griet is a young woman living in Holland with her caring but manipulative mother, blinded father, and young enthusiastic sister when out of the blue her mother informs her that she is to leave to work for the painter Vermeer and his household in order to make ends meat for her family. Reluctantly she packs her few possessions and head off to the other side of town where her life will be completely different even down to the smallest changes(like the butcher she is to go to). First of all her new house is in the Catholic section of town and growing up a Protestant makes her feel very out of place. Secondly she knows know one there and is treated by almost all like she is no one. As she works masterfully cleaning Master Vermeer's studio and running errands for the old Widow and mother in law, Maria Thins she finds how difficult her place in life is. Half the days Vermeer is kindly and affectionate towards her while other days he is distant and cold. Griet, among all her troubles finds herself falling for the charming butchers son. Although  she and her master clearly have feelings for each other they are kept apart by their class differences. this makes things even more complicated for the young Griet. She must worry about was is best for her family and herself, although she does not have much of a say as a young woman in seventeenth century Holland. Tracy Chevalier manages to really get inside Griet's head while keeping the reader thoroughly enthralled. <BR>This book was by far one of the best I've read and I highly recommend it. One reason why this book is so wonderful is because you get to knw Griet so well that you feel as though you we're right there with her. You can truly understand and relate to many of the feelings she confronts. Although Girl With a Pearl Earring takes place in the 17th century her problems are not unlike the ones many young women face. It is often hard to tell where one fits in especially in a group that you are foreign too. Being able to feel for the protagonist made a big difference in how read the book and it kept me turning pages late into the night. Another reason I found this book interesting was because the characters were so deep. At the beginning you are introduced to the major characters but as the story progresses more is revealed about their personalities and you are able to sympathize with even Griet's antagonists. For example Tanneke, the other household made, is often cross and bitter towards Griet. However you learn that although she may not be so sympathetic to Griet she is a good person at heart and is not set out just to make Griet unhappy(as one may assume at first). This book was fascinating for me because of deepness behind Griet and her acquaintances. <BR>Although I greatly ejnoyed reading Girl With a Pearl Earring I understand that others may not because they don't knwo what it's like to be a fourteen year old girl. Although the protagonist is a girl and many of the issues she deals with are due to her gender (especially at that particular period of history) it is not a legitimate reason not to read the boom just because you aren't or never were a young woman. There is much more behind the story that boys can appreciate too, and although they may not be able to sympathize with Griet's issues it does not mean that they can't get an idea of what it feels like to be her, and enjoy it while they're at it. This is great book for anybody to read and be able to get an amazing sense of 17th century Holland.
B000002UB3|5.0|ABBEY ROAD, the Beatles' last album to be recorded, will amaze even a dedicated fan. By August 1969, when it was recorded, the Beatles were on the verge of breaking up. Then it's some feat that it's one of their most united efforts together. <br />The material on ABBEY ROAD is first rate, as it is with many other great Beatles records. ABBEY ROAD is Lennon &amp; McCartney at their best, and the same is true with Ringo and George. Possibly Ringo's best Beatles song, &quot;Octopus's Garden,&quot; is included. George, at this point, had materialized as a first rate songwriter, as evidenced by two of his best Beatles songs, which are the very catchy &quot;Something,&quot; and the beautiful acoustic <BR>&quot;Here Comes The Sun.&quot; Reportedly written about what happened when he left the Beatles frequently, that tune is a forgotten classic. <br />John gives it his best. The result is the supremely melodic <BR>&quot;Come Together,&quot; with its classic 'shoot-too' chorus. He also gives us some quite enjoyable heavy rock in &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy),&quot; written as a love song for Yoko Ono. &quot;Because,&quot; with touches of the synthesizer, may be the greatest Beatles singing harmony on record. McCartney may not be in this as much as the others, but his churns out &quot;Oh! Darling,&quot; an energetic ballad pleading for his darling to belive him. &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money,&quot; another McCartney original, doesn't make much sense. And &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; finds Paul in a more experimental stage, which at times can be mediocre, but is a good piece of music nonetheless.<br />But ABBEY ROAD is most known for its Side Two medley of studio songs that, at times are little more than throwaways, but nonetheless a testimate to what the Beatles could do with their days winding down. Here, the driving force seems to be Lennon &amp; McCartney, giving us the &quot;Sun King,&quot; &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard,&quot;<BR>&quot;Polythelene Pam,&quot; &quot;She Came In Through the Bathroom Window,&quot; <BR>&quot;Golden Slumbers,&quot; &quot;Carry That Weight,&quot; &quot;The End,&quot; and &quot;Her Majesty.&quot; Of these songs, the ones that really stand out are &quot;Bathroom Window,&quot; a slightly bluesy tribute to the woman who broke into his house one day; &quot;The End,&quot; which the Beatles get to really rock, but where Ringo gets to do his only drum solo; and finally the easy, laid back &quot;Sun King.&quot;
006092988X|5.0|Francie Nolan is a character who will long be remembered by anyone who reads &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.&quot; Bright but lonely, poor but resourceful, Francie Nolan is captured from ages 11 to 16 with poignancy and love. Francie is her daddy's &quot;prima donna&quot; and she treasures his love while fighting to win her mother's. Although she never achieves the place in her mother's heart that her brother holds, her strength and sheer perserverance guide her through difficult times. Like the sturdy tree that grows outside her window and survives all catastrophes, Francie Nolan survives poverty, lack of formal education, sexual assault, extreme loneliness, and lost love.<br />The reader first meets Francie at age 11 when, as an inquisitive young girl, her favorite time of the day is on Saturday when she can go to the library then rush home with her treasure and read the afternoon away on the fire escape of her Brooklyn tenement. As a young girl, she feels &quot;rich&quot; when she receives bits of chalk and stubby pencils her mother and father bring home from their janitoring job at a local school. She finds simple pleasures in her life, like being allowed to sleep in the front room on Saturday night and watch the busy street below. You will ache to go back in time and be Francie's best friend as she battles loneliness and rejection by her peers but learns to live a solitary life. But, like the tree, she is ready to burst into bloom and when she does it is beautiful to read about.<br />This book is a wonderful description of life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn and a strong statement on the hope offered to the immigrants who came to the United States. The story emphasizes quite clearly the value of reading and a good education, but most importantly the strength of family and the dreams that sustain people. As Francie learns, &quot;there had to be the dark and muddy waters so that the sun could have something to background it flashing glory.&quot; Young teens and mature women alike will relish Francie's story and hold its message in their hearts forever.mature women alike will relish Francie's story and hold its message in their hearts forever.
B000002UAX|4.0|THE BEATLES, also known as THE WHITE ALBUM, has been described over many years as being one of the greatest albums of all time and the Beatles' best. In fact, in comparison to such classics as REVOLVER, SGT. PEPPER, and ABBEY ROAD, it's some of their worst work. But, in comparison to YELLOW SUBMARINE, it's definitely their better work, so it's not like THE WHITE ALBUM is a complete disaster. It definitely would have worked better as a single album containing its strongest tracks. It was supposed to be the record that got it right; in other words, bring the Beatles back to Earth after all of their psychadelic experimentation and conceptual work. Instead, they let it get all over the place, sometimes to the point of being self-indulgent, and sometimes to the point of creating their best music. Most critics rate it so many stars simply because it has so much material on it, so it wouldn't hurt if a few songs weren't any good. In fact, however, nearly half of THE WHITE ALBUM is filler, so it's not like a small amount isn't very good.  <br />Talking about THE WHITE ALBUM's strong points, there are plenty (enough to fill a single disc). George's moment of glory is &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; one of his best Beatles songs. Lennon &amp; McCartney have great moments, although it seems that they aren't working as closely to each other as they had been. They both deliver: &quot;Dear Prudence,&quot; John's tribute of Mia Farrow's sister shines; Paul's melodic &quot;Blackbird,&quot;; &quot;Julia,&quot; John's tribute to his mother works well; Paul's near heavy-metal slammer &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; bangs; &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; John's bluesy, if slightly cheesy blues playing, is cooked well; Paul's &quot;Birthday&quot; is definitely enjoyable; John's silly but melodic &quot;Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey,&quot;; and Paul's &quot;Why Don't We Do It In the Road,&quot; is hilarious. But there are also some other great songs, includingRingo's &quot;Don't Pass Me By,&quot; &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun,&quot; &quot;I Will,&quot; &quot;Cry Baby Cry,&quot; and &quot;Martha My Dear.&quot;<br />But all the songs that are not mentioned here are either filler, throwaways, or plain bad songs. As I have said previously, THE WHITE ALBUM would have worked as a single album, not a double. Tracks like the pompous &quot;The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill,&quot; the extremely irritating &quot;Wild Honey Pie,&quot; the jazzy &quot;Honey Pie,&quot; the dull &quot;Glass Onion,&quot; the weak &quot;Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da,&quot; the stupid &quot;Piggies,&quot; and the ridiculous &quot;Good Night&quot; agreeably should never have gained official release. But perhaps the most preposterous track on this album is &quot;Revolution 9,&quot; that simply is just a number of countless sound effects, spoken words, and banging noises instead of a melody; a precursor to the waste that plagued Lennon and Yoko Ono's first albums together. Thankfully, this experiment failed. <br />But yet, with all of this filler, THE WHITE ALBUM still stands up and doesn't fail the test. Yet, for something that was supposed to bring the Beatles back to more basic rock, it's unimpressive.
0451191153|1.0|After many years reading Ayn Rand's work -- both fictional and philosophical -- and sincerely trying to understand why so many people find her philosophy of selfishness to be &quot;the answer,&quot; I have finally come to believe that these people who claim to value &quot;reason&quot; are either seriously misguided, or just plain evil.  Ms. Rand, quite clearly, falls into the latter camp.  She promoted selfishness because she knew it would make her a goddess figure among people desparate to latch onto a philosophy to justify their pursuit of the most base impulses of self-indulgence, and to allow them to continue to avoid the genuinely human practice of compassion.  I am not a religious person, but it seems unavoidably significant that every religious or moral system in the world recognizes the virtue of helping those in need, with one glaring exception: the moral system promoted in this book.  That, to me, is pretty good evidence that this philosophy is evil. <br />(Note: I am remaining anonymous not because I do not wish to engage in thoughtful dialogue over this book and philosophy, but to avoid hate mail from the many hateful people who espouse Objectivism.)
B000001ABD|1.0|the first realization that i probably needed to brush up on my Stevie Wonder came when i fell in love with a song on the Beach Boys album Wild Honey, called \\"I Was Made To Love Her\\".  Upon inspecting the liner notes, i saw that it was an old Stevie Wonder song (easy to laugh at at the Beach Boys doing a Stevie song; but trust me, it's from a much funkier, 1968 album and is pretty true to the original).  in any case, i rushed over to my parents, leafed through my mothers cd's, and turned up with this set.  VICTORY!  it had the song i was looking for!  but wait....what's this?  the album is weighted down with so much unlistenable, synth-schmaltzy, sappy, drippy goop that the real attitude and funk is almost totally drowned in the ocean of syrupy sentimentality and programmed drum tracks.  we aren't even given the grace of having the songs arranged chronologically, so as to perhaps get 2/3 of disc one full of classic Stevie.  the album leads of with bad 80's technology and is saturated all the way through with it.  trying to be on the cutting edge with your musical production can be a blessing in as much as it makes you something of a visionary at the time, but it can make you sound dated as the years go on.  the thing is, \\"Superstition\\" sounds dated in a hip-shaking, head-bobbing, strutting onto the dance floor, baddest of the bad, kind of way, but songs like \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\" sound dated in a very sterile, harmless, uncompelling, Walt Disney Movie sort of way.  this set does little more than pay tribute to Wonder's ability to be bland, tepid, and score big hits with cheesy ballads and 1980's drum machines.  stay funky.  buy the older albums.
0316776963|5.0|Having just finished Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris, I felt really let down. Not because the book was a failure in my eyes, but because it was over, and I had no more opportunities to laugh out loud,nudge people and say, &quot;Hey, listen to this!&quot; Which doesn't exactly buy me any points with anyone. The book is the best of its genre: ascerbic and witty and, as I used to tell my creative writing students, self-effacing. One can hardly point out the absurdity of others without showing his own, and Sedaris does such a clean, uncluttered job of it that my critical editor demon, who lives in the hope that she will get a good piece of prose to chew up and spit out, goes hungry, and I am fed just enough. He manages to tell just enough, enough to make the reader believe in the truth as stranger than fiction essays in the book. I was being treated like an adult, one with enough intelligence to see much more than is on the paper, trusted with intimate details of a life strangely lived. Sedaris is the kind of writer that makes you want to meet him, hang out with and talk to and listen and try not to be embarrassed at the fact that he is maybe oblivious to the social laws he is breaking by sitting in boxer shorts and black socks in an outdoor restaurant. And I want to do the same. <BR>On a trip to England, my husband and I watched Miss Firecracker on the television in our room instead of joining in with the rest of the country's celebration of the 50th anniversary of D Day, which just happened to begin when we arrived, and which I was unaware of until getting off the plane.  As we staggered into Heathrow, hundreds of signs were waving, hoping to connect with the great numbers of older couples,politicians, and entourages that had accompanied us on the flight. And on our return,a week after OJ drove down a California highway with a disguise and his passport, we were oblivious to the event and sordid details until we hit Boston. That's the kind of thing Sedaris helps us see--the embarrassment and confusion of coming into the room and knowing everyone is talking and then they suddenly turn to look at you and you want to think you don't know why but you have probably six reasons tucked away ready to jump up and own the enbarrassment and humiliation.<BR>I loved this book, pure and simple, and hope others who avoid nonfiction like the plague, as I do, will give it a try.
B000006XDR|5.0|I love the melodies on this album, and from reading other reviews that seems to be the overall concensus.  I love bands that focus on melody, i believe it is the most important factor in music; there must be a good melody.  But they're melody is stressed in instrumentation rather than human voice.  It's very hypnotic and mellow sounding, nothing like Yes or the keyboard work from Tony Banks, i wouldn't call it progressive as far as virtuosity goes.  It's progressive for it's themeatical and chordal development, very much like classical music, but with rock and roll instruments.  After listening to Mirage i am very much looking forward to getting their most popular album &quot;The Snowgoose&quot;.
B000053VAF|5.0|Ah, another religious movie victim of vicious pre-release criticism. Much like &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ,&quot; many critics ralied against Dogma, though they had not seen it. Perhaps what they were most afraid of was agreeing with Kevin Smith.<br />Smith favorites Matt Damon and Ben Afflect star as a pair of angels, banished to Earth, who have discovered a loophole to get themselves back into Heaven. This loophole is provided by a hilarious George Carlin as Cardinal Glick, who is leading an effort to put a happier, modern face to Catholicism. Cardinal Glick is officiating at the re-opening of an old church, with an offer to all who pass through its gates a chance at redemtion. This is the loophole the angels wish to exploit, which would allow them to re-enter Heaven. Unfortunately, doing so would destroy everything in existence.<br />I have a small nit with director Smith: he's not very subtle. There are times during the movie where it seems Smith is Saying Something Important, as the cast launches into many a religious lecture.<br />And what a great cast it is, with Linda Fiorentino as Bethany, a woman called upon to stop the renegade angels and save the world; Chris Rock as the forgotten 13th Apostle, Rufus; Selma Hayek as a beautiful, heavenly muse; and of course, Smith mainstays Jay and Silent Bob. Jason Lee, underused in the film, plays the smirking, evil demon Azrael, as is George Carlin, which Smith discusses in his commentary on the second disc.<br />Being a special edition DvD, this one delivers, with a second disc of outtakes, commentary, and deleted scenes. The film transfer is absolutely beautiful, full of rich color, with great Dolby 5.1 sound.<br />As someone new to the View Askew universe, I found the movie very accessible, and the commentary provided by Smith offers a humorous introduction into this universe.
B000021YQV|5.0|Let me just say that System of a Downs new record Toxicity is nothing short of awesome. The CD starts of hard with &quot;Prison Song&quot; and leaves you begging for more. Once again the lyrics are focused on political issues and well thought out ideas which is a welcome change from the typical &quot;my girlfriend left me&quot; records. So if you're into hard rock and meaningful lyrics pick up this CD. You won't be let down.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is simply phenomenal.  I bought this CD a year and a half ago, and I'm still listening to it!  I bought S&amp;M with no knowledge of Metallica except that they made &quot;Enter Sandman.&quot;  That being said, this album turned me into a full-blown Metallica fan.  I had no idea how many great songs they had on their record.  S&amp;M covers a whole spectrum.  Some songs are slow and soothing, others are fast and heavy as can be.  All the songs preformed have the same flare as the original versions, but thanks to the San Francisco Symphony, they're doubled in intensity!  If you enjoy heavy metal, hard rock, soft rock, or music in general do yourself a favor and buy this CD.  You won't be disappointed.
0780622650|1.0|Why would New Line even bother to make this a special edition??? Why waste time and effort on THE worst movie ever? EVERYTHING about this movie was absolutly horrible. EVERYTHING. It was not fun, it was not anywhere near entertaining. There was so much wrong with this film, I could easily exceed the word limit, but to do that, I'd have to rewatch it to refresh my memory of all the stuff I tried in vain to block out. I had completly forgotten why I hated it, untill it was on cable, and it came back in a horrible flood. The MAJOR flaws however are:<br />1. The special effects WERE NOT THAT GOOD. If you look at the CG effects, you'll note that they are pretty much devoid of realistic shadowing and texturing, giving it a 'Roger Rabbit' style.<br />2. The plot, ESPECIALLY at the end, is completly incomphrehensible, Sure, I could have figured it out, but by that point, my head had exploded because of the staggering badness of what was before me.<br />3. The whole idea. Lost in Space was never a good show, and it was never popular. So why why WHY make a new one???<br />How anyone actually could enjoy this, especially ebough to actually BUY IT, pretty much proves that it is the end of the world.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|LONG LIVE LOVE!!! I thought that this was the best movie out of the whole year. That person who wrote that terrible review is the stupidest person in the world, a person who cannot understand good work when they see it. It was so well put together, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman did an absolutely marvelous job, and they have wonderful voices. And the dialouge especially was fabulous. &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love,<BR>and be loved in return.&quot; The fabulous actor that plays Toulouse is very good. I encourage the whole world that has any sense of music or talent to see it.
0792839749|2.0|As for the movie, I loved it as a kid and I love it more now....and I expect more as an adult as well.  With the hefty pricetag of a new DVD edition, I expect to see the entire film, not a cut-up version, formatted for the small screen.  Imagine...Chitty Chitty floating blissfully through the sky, and most of the sky cut out!  The stately castle scenes, with half of the scenery cut out!  How disappointing!
B000000WF0|5.0|It's so sad that the Verve broke up, they really had potential, and if any of their records proved it, it was &quot;Urban Hymns.&quot;  There's a lot more here than the sweeping &quot;Bittersweet Symphony,&quot; as the album moves from one gorgeous ballad to the next, particulary &quot;Sonnet&quot;, &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot; (one of the most moving songs I've heard in the several years), and &quot;This Time.&quot;  The dreamy, subdued texture that everyone's talking about truley is apparent, especially on the hazy, almost drug-like chilled rocker &quot;The Rolling People,&quot; the sexy, ambient &quot;Neon Wilderness,&quot; and the psychedelic &quot;Catching the Butterfly.&quot;  The songs are very emotional, romantic, and can be taken however you want... a reflection of your deepest pain or the most dreamy, beautiful songs you've heard in quite sometime.  If you're trying to find some clear distinction of the Verve, think of a cross between U2 and David Gray.  I really recommend this.
B000021YQV|4.0|*Any four star rating given by me is a good rating, for my four stars would be someone elses five. Just clarifying. Thanks. =)  If needed, I will do a follow-up review.<br />This album has a definitely different feeling from their dynamite debut. Taking two steps forward in the field of creativity and diversity, they take a step back with a few mediocre songs on this album. Where as the last album kept me exited and attentive througout, I find myself skipping through parts of this CD to get to the greater contents. But none of the songs on this CD are bad at all in my oppinion.<BR> But some of the songs are truely phenominal! The hit &quot;Chop Suey&quot; is a great song with great lyrics. It's eclectic variety of instruments and styles is great. Strings, piano, hardcore, punk, acoustic guitar...it's all there! Great melody, too.<BR> The first song, Prison Song, is a great political song with many movements.<BR> If you're looking for something reflects System's sound on the last CD, look to the song &quot;Shimmy&quot; for a hard hitting, fun loving song. <BR> Last but definately not least, &quot;Aerials&quot;, the last song on this disk, is a phenominal song that is musically and lyricaly beautiful in my ears, and at the end takes a very musicaly suprising and beautiful turn! If you are getting or already have the CD, you'll know what mean....<BR>This CD has it's Flaws, but it great for the most part. It was worth the money for me. Maybe it is for you, too.
B000002B7M|5.0|Ozzy's first solo album, and his best. You only need 2 of his albums. This one and Diary of A Madman. After that, it goes downhill until No More Tears. Randy Rhoads's solos are amazing. It really is very sad how he died at a young age. And there's also the great drumming and basswork. It proves that they're not there to make the guitarist show off. Ozzy's singing is not as nasal as other albums, but it is Ozzy, alright. Some classic riffing here. &quot;Crazy Train&quot; and &quot;Revelation&quot; are the best tracks on this album. ENJOY!
B00003CXZ4|3.0|The concept, execution and acting are all brilliant. There are two problems, however.  One is that you have to work way too hard to follow this.  The second is the standard art film convention that the film must end with an unsatisfying non-conclusion.<br />Guy Pierce is a very fine actor but I sort of wish they had used Keanu or Travolta because they themselves wouldn't have known what was going on.<br />So its ingenious...and the point of it is.........must have slipped my mind.  As Groucho Marx said &quot;Next time, come back when you can't stay so long!&quot;
B00005LKIM|4.0|While not up the best sequel, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is much more gory than its prequel &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;  Mason Verger, who peeled off his face, is out to catch Hannibal Lecter.  But so is Clarice, Jodie Foster was better at acting than Julianne Moore, but Moore still did a pretty good job.  My favorite part is when Clarice is unconsious in Hannibal's arms and it's showing their shadow as Lecter carries her to her home.  At the end Lecter cuts of this guy's skull and there are his brains, right there sitting in the top of his head.  I would recommend renting this movie before buying it, but if you want true Hannibal Lecter entertainment then watch &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;
B000009QO6|5.0|Well, Danzig is more of a rock band than heavy metal, so don't buy this expecting stuff you can headbang to... It's more like stuff you can shake your shoulders and &quot;rock&quot; along to. My favorite song on the whole CD is &quot;Twist of Cain&quot;. It has a slow, steady, rock beat and will have you singing along after you play it a few times. Now then, as for &quot;Explicit Lyrics&quot;, there aren't any. It has the little warning label on the CD about the lyrics, but a book of lyrics are included with the CD, and I didn't even see the &quot;d-word&quot; in it. Strange... Well, anyways, Danzig is an overall decent band and I think even non-rock fans should get this excellent CD by them.
006109594X|5.0|Maybe I gloss over technical errors to easily.  This is a novel,  not a manual.<br />Mr Robinson wrote a great book.  His description of Taking off and Landing on an Aircraft Carrier made me feel like I was actually in the F/A 18 taking a trap.  <br />Read this book, its great
B00005AAFS|5.0|Of the three albums, &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; is Rammstein at their most experimental and eclectic. Less conventionally heavy-metal than &quot;Herzeleid&quot;, less aurally-cogent than &quot;Mutter&quot;, it nevertheless makes up for that with a breathtaking palette of innovative rhythmic beats and snappy guitar riffs. Indeed, every track here is soaked with such surefooted rhythmic verve and snap --- making this Rammstein's most toe-tapping and &quot;catchy&quot; album to date. <br />Augmenting this strength are the memorable, rib-tickling lyrics. Yes, rib-tickling. Some of the lyrics (like &quot;Kuss Mich Fellerfrosch&quot; and &quot;Bueck dich&quot; for instance) really get my funny bone. I do humbly consider myself to be a member of Sane Society, and do not reckon the lyrics in this album to be the product of malevolently sick or pathological minds (as some of the unsympathetic media/critics have suggested). Rather, there is definitely a wry, sardonic humor at work behind the band's lyric-werk. Lyrically, Sehnsucht is Rammstein's most innovative album!<br />And even if you don't understand German or have the lyric-translations at hand, you can still enjoy the album solely on the strengths of the music alone. Like I'd said: great beats, great guitarwerk, and great singing too. This is one rock album whose appeal transcends its genre. (I'm a classical music &amp; Sade fan normally...) <br />So I can't imagine anyone not liking this great album. <BR>Probably only Fellerfrosches. :::guffaw:::
6303014100|4.0|This is the Battle of Gettysburg as presented by Turner Home Entertainment/Turner Pictures. You will recognize Ted Turner -- top banana in this bunch -- as the man known worldwide as Mr. Jane Fonda. <br />The battle scenes are as advertised in the blurbs on the box: &quot;...some of the most authentic Civil War battle scenes ever committed to film, accurately depicting events and battles....&quot; Yes, the battle scenes were impressive, convincing, and appeared to be the result of a good deal of effort by the director and the cast. <br />The actors, appropriately, speak through great, obvious wads of cotton batting pretending to be whiskers, as they deliver their lines. Apparently, this film provided work for many re-enactors and students of the Civil War.<br />Right from the get-go, however, Turner Home Entertainment stakes out the anti-Confederate low ground with this film. They depict the South's greatest hero -- and arguably the greatest general of all time -- as an almost dwarf-like creature astride a stunted horse. This is an elaborate metaphor, involving casting, direction, and the portrayal of General Lee, intended to diminish honor, glory, bravery, and to revise history. Both horse and rider appear as &quot;smaller-than-life&quot; characters.<br />In scene after scene, General Robert E. Lee, a man of erect bearing just over 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighing 170 pounds is shown among men who tower over him, both on foot and on horseback. If this were the case, the entire Confederate army would have to have been over 6 feet 4 inches tall. The only people obviously shorter than Robert E. Lee, in this film, are the 12-year-old drummer boys.<br />The &quot;Dukes of Hazard&quot; had a more convincing General Lee.<br />Martin Sheen, a small (in many ways) leftist actor, but not without talent, plays the heroic Southern General as a stubby neurotic in various states of confusion bordering on hysteria. The viewer is led to picture Robert E. Lee as a Leprechaun insteadof the giant that he was. <br />Mr. Sheen's Southern drawl was well done, almost musical, but one wonders if Professor Henry Higgins would find it appropriate for a man raised in Northern Virginia?<br />Not content with this miscarriage of history Ted Turner and his hench-persons perform the same alchemist's transformation on Traveller: General Lee's trusty battle charger. The war-horse is depicted not only as too small, but also as the proverbial &quot;horse of a different color&quot;. <br />The real Traveller was in Lee's own words: &quot;Confederate gray with black mane and tail,&quot; while the animal under Martin Sheen in the film appears white, with gray mane and tail (sometimes it appears as all white).<br />The real Traveller was fully 16 hands high and over 1,300 pounds, apparently too much horse for the diminutive Sheen. So, a great battle charger was transformed into a stunted pony-like animal. <BR>Quite an effective metaphor really: depicting Robert E. Lee as a stubby historical figure. It is only a short hop to the conclusion that, because he was small in stature, he had small ideas, small talents and little courage. None of this is true. <BR>Despite the shortcomings discussed above, this film is worth watching for the battle scenes and for the attention paid to the details of the battle of Gettysburg.
068484267X|5.0|My girlfriend begged me to read this book and at first I was reluctant to read it. I read the first chapter and I couldn't believe this was a true story about someone's life. I read this book in one day and I can't believe how glued I was to this book! I normally like fantasy, sci-fi, philosophy or historical fiction. I was truely blown away about Frank Mccourt life and how he survived the depression especially in Ireland. This book was depressing and made me want to cry, I was hoping for a happy ending. Even though the ending wasn't what I expected it. It makes me want to read the next book. Great writing Mr Mccourt!!
B00000IQC8|5.0|Easily one of the funniest movies ever made. Each character (especially Randall) delivers some of the most scorching lines you will EVER here in a movie. Be careful! Watch it once, and you may become hooked (not only to this flick, but all of Kevin Smith's other projects)... I watched it three times the first night I rented it way back in '95, and then bought it shortly thereafter...
B00000JPHG|3.0|This movie certainly isn't like any of the other Chucky movies. That much is for certain. It has horror and comedy mixed together and a rather funny, but vulgar, reference to that wicker making, cookie baking alien from another planet, Martha Stewart. Although the Tiffany doll doesn't have the housekeeping skills of Martha, she tries very hard. She is, you know, a doll. The movie isn't really scary. It's more of a twisted black comedy than anything else. It has a few horrible deaths in it, but doesn't have the horror or suspense like past sequels. Still, it is a rather odd, yet entertaining film. My niece Kadra says this one is her favorite of all time. Will it be yours?. John Ritter shows up in a cameo as the uncle of the movie's heroine. He is good. Jennifer Tilly, as Tiffany, is very watchable and good. Bride Of Chucky is totally different from the others. Watch it and see for yourself. Another one wouldn't be a bad thing.
0743216458|3.0|I'm a big fan of Ambrose's Undaunted Courage, and I had read all the hype about this book. Unfortunately, the lavish praise for Band of Brothers is not deserved. The writing is surprisingly flat, colorless, and devoid of detail, emotion, or perception. The problem seems to be that few of the members of Easy Company were particularly expressive or literate. Most of the accounts are as flat as an entry in the typical business person's DayTimer. Some examples of Ambrose's writing, picked more or less at random:<br />&quot;Speirs led an attack on the final gun, which he took and destroyed, losing two men killed.&quot;<br />&quot;Hill raised his head to look. A bullet hit him in the forehead and came out behind his ear, killing him instantly.&quot;<br />&quot; 'Fire at will,' Williams called out.<br />It was a duck shoot. The Germans were fleeing.&quot;<br />&quot;Contact was reestablished. Easy moved out again.&quot;<br />And so on -- the book appears to have been written for a grade school reading level. Band of Brothers represents passable storytelling, but falls far short of literature.
6304924216|5.0|John Woo astonishes with his camera movements and balletic action sequences.  &quot;Face/Off&quot; is the action movie that everybody should see because of its spectacular action, as well as the tremendous performances by John Travolta and Nicolas Cage.<br />Travolta plays FBI agent Sean Archer, who wants to have revenge over the death of his little boy, killed by terrorist Castor Troy (Cage).  But the real deal about their perfomances occurs when Archer decides to switch faces with Troy's in order to avoid the explosion of a bomb at the L.A. Convention Center.  It's fantastic how the two actors perform one another -Travolta playing Cage, Cage playing Travolta.  I mean those actors should have been nominated for some awards.<br />The confrontation between those two characters makes this John Woo film a real kick.  Don't miss it.
0070511136|4.0|I'm a geek, but, due to circumstances beyond my control, I was forced to create some sales training.  I had this book recommended to me, and it saved my sanity.<br />The title is very unfortunate. &quot;SPIN&quot; in this book doesn't refer to the stuff that White House flunkies and PR flacks do...it's an acronym for the components of Rackham's sales methodology. <br />If you're not a sales type, you may have been grossed out by the high B.S. level of most books about selling.  This book, on the other hand, is very factual and direct, and it's free of hoopla, glittering generalizations, and vacuous, trivial &quot;case studies.&quot;  Most amazingly, it presents sales in a way that makes it seem not so morally repellent.  If it's humanly possible for sales to be a customer-service function, it's by following the practices in &quot;Spin Selling.&quot;
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is a one-of-a-kind movie, not to be missed for ANYTHING!!! Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix put on a tale of epic proportions. Two men desperately struggle for power as they try to tear each other to apart. Ridley Scott and crew do an outstanding job in recreating the shear power of the Roman empire and it's beginnings to an end. Connie Nielsen is stuck rite in the middle of the intense rivalry, brothering Phoenix and loving Crowe. <br />Maximus (Crowe), the loved general, is finished with war in Germania as his valiant army finishes off the last of the opposing threat. Maximus seeks a peaceful return home to his farm, where he left his wife and son 4 years ago. Times change as the current emperor passes onward into Alesium. Phoenix orders the death of Maximus and his family. To bad only part of his wish is carried out as Maximus escapes just in time to see the aftermath of his family's death. Forced into slavery Maximus becomes a basically a target for killing in the arena. Maximus does not stay in the arena for long. The new emperor has decieded to host a series of games in his late father's honor. Maximus is flushed right into the center of Rome, where he gains the peoples respect. Using that as his only defense from Phoenix killing him, Maximus manages to become the Savior Of Rome.<br />Gladiator is a force not to be reckoned with. As each second passes a chill will race down your spine and then a warmth will race back up it, as you are thrown into the sand of the Colleseum. Scott, Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen all names known widely now because of this one spectacular feature.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Despite it being a six(eight)-track EP, Broken is without a doubt as essential as any of NIN's full length albums and is an important part in the musical evolution of nine inch nails. Some of Trent Reznor's finest compositions are on this release, including &quot;Happiness In Slavery&quot;, &quot;Wish&quot;, and &quot;Gave Up&quot;. This may well be NIN's loudest, most guitar-driven album, full of hysterical noise and scathing, angry lyrics. It paves the way for the even more abrasive &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I loved this movie. Everything about it was outstanding: the casting, the setting, the &quot;feel&quot;, the script, the costumes. And the music --- it was wonderful and set the scenes perfectly. I rarely, if ever, like a movie as well as the book, but this was a definite exception. I hated to see it end and plan to watch it again soon.<br />Enough has already been said about the story, so I will not add more, except to say that the movie was very close to the book. With the exception of a few politically correct changes (the mayor, not the priest is the bad guy and Depp's character is never called a gypsy as he is in the book), it was very true to Harris's novel.<br />The extras at the end of the DVD were better than any I have seen before. One section was about the town in which the movie was filmed. Another part was a discussion with the costume designer. These parts added a lot to my enjoyment.<br />A totally wonderful viewing experience.
B000002AS3|5.0|The year was 1994.  I was in the 7th grade and was just getting into the whole music scene.  Sadly, Kurt Cobain died and so did most of alternative rock.  Then came the boys from Manchester with their cocky swagger and their confident rock 'n roll.  Most people in the States remember Oasis for their multi-platinum albulm, &quot;What's the Story?  Morning Glory?&quot;, but &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; tops that albulm in my book.  If you love pure, catchy rock 'n roll and are just tired of that manufactured Pop music that's out there, you should definitely get this CD.  Songs like SUPERSONIC, LIVE FOREVER, SLIDE AWAY, and ROCK 'N ROLL STAR are the epitimey of the mid-90's:  Being young, carefree, and on top of the world.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down's unique style of music has made them one of my favorite bands.  They sound like no one else that i have ever heard.  The lead singer is very talented and i think that SOAD will go a long ways.  BUY THIS CD IT IS A MUST HAVE!!
B000002BBY|5.0|Just an amazing albulm as a whole.  It doesn't matter whether you're into brit-rock or hip-hop, you'll fall to your knees about this CD.  This is one of those albulms which you can listen to it a thousand times and never get tired of it.  It's easy to forget how big these guys were in the mid-90s...and for a good reason.  &quot;What's the Story?&quot; is a product of a rock band at the height of their musical and creative geniuses.  Definitley a classic!
B00004YW6I|5.0|Not many albums are (all of these things) edgy, honest, beautiful, desperate, and hopeful.  Pj Harvey turns an appreciative, yet discerning eye on her world.  If you like PJ Harvey, you're guaranteed to like Stories From The City. . .  If you don't like PJ Harvey. . .
B00003CXRM|4.0|I did not like the way he acted in ER, and I have the Batman he portraited. How surpise..George Cloony is quite good in this musical, so is another two actors which is a little more funnier. The song impressed me from the beginning to the end. The story itselfs not very funny and so-so plot. But the way they made this movie, I felt the satisfraction up to the end. Just like watching the &quot;3 strooges&quot; (not funny) mixed with &quot;Butch cassidy and the Sundance kid&quot; with a touch of &quot;A Coal mining dauther&quot;
B00003CXSP|1.0|The bad news is, they did a terrible job of turning the novel into a film. The good news is, maybe that means (if it's legally possible) someone someday will try to do it right? What makes you want to scream is not the scary movie; what makes you want to scream is the stupidity of actually filming the gypsy woman and actually filming the Botticelli &quot;subplot&quot; then cutting both of them out of the final film, with the usual directorial mumblings about Well, it didn't seem to advance the story - we just didn't need it (as we learn from the DVD special feature segment). But for the mood to be properly established, yes you do need it all: you need BOTH gypsies; you need the Botticelli &quot;subplot&quot; (which adds up to far more than Ridley Scott's condescending label suggests); and of course you need the nursing scene, the romance at the end, where it all begins to make a crazy kind of &quot;sense&quot; at last. As it stands, Hannibal the film, has about it the feel of a project where they kept toasting one another with champagne periodically and saying, in effect, &quot;If we get a champagne buzz, then isn't our work good?&quot; Fools rushing in where angels fear to tread, without ever having read the book. In this case, buy the novel (in hard cover, as it deserves) but don't even bother to rent the so-called movie out of idle curiosity. (I have nothing against a movie outshining its novelistic source material, by the way: Cape Fear is an example where the cinematic treatment - especially the later one with music by Bernard Herrmann - is so superior to the book that you have to wonder how that dreary little dime novel could ever have inspired such poetry on the screen. But with Hannibal, the relationship is sadly reversed: the novelist shows us exactly where the poetry resides, and the filmmaking team throws half of it away, rationalizing their every step, of course.)
B00003CXZ4|3.0|I heard such great things about this film, but I tried to watch it with little expectations.  I really like Guy Pierce and Carrie Anne-Moss, and the style and concept were interesting - however, It just took too long to get there -and I didn't think that figuring out the ending was all that difficult or surprising.  Rent, not buy.
B000001IPL|5.0|Awesome! This is an awesome CD. It's most like Ixnay on the Hombre and Ignition.
0789723107|5.0|Before I bought this book I had bought Jakob Nielsen's book Designing Web Usabillity and thought that it was an awesome book on web usabillity. Then I got Don't Make Me Think and was blown away.<BR>Where Nielsen is often fairly right in his observations he's a bit pretentious in his outlook. Krug is far from that is his book. He offers his insights on the subject in an extremely personable, engaging way. (I read the entire book in one sitting) The writing is succinct and to the point but doesn't read like a text book. He offers you his insights in the context of real world observations which enable you to comprehend the subject all the more easily. If you're looking for a book that will give you a crash course on how to think like a web usabillity expert look no further. If you have a project your working on and are considering usabillity and design issue like I was, I think you will be completely satisfied with the information contained in this book.
B00000K31Q|5.0|i love this movie. its a great romance and comedy. it stars the incredibly hot julia stiles and cool andrew keegan. the story is a guy likes a girl but she cant date till her sister does so andrew keegan sets her sister up with heath ledgers charector. the rest you will have to find out.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Maybe its just me, but the &quot;hooks&quot; in Clint Eastwood bear a striking resemblance to a '70s Neil Young song entitled &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;.<br />This record is worth buying because I was hearing new and interesting things each time I would listen to it.  Be warned this album is very eclectic, but at the same time it is not annoyingly so.  It is difficult to categorize because it combines a little bit of everything.  <br />More power to this sort of effort, because it takes experimentation in order for music to evolve and that is sorely needed right about now.
B00004RFFS|5.0|i loved this. tom cruise did a great job and it was well made. bradd pitt plays a vampire and so does tom cruise.

B0000214F3|4.0|I didn't see this movie in the theatre because of the critical reviews. I did rent it after listening to the soundtrack. The length of the movie was so necessary to letting the characters explore their feelings instead of quickly cutting to the next scene. I appreciated the directors foresight in this area. I was gratefully surprised by how much I enjoyed this thought-provoking film.  One itty-bitty change at the end would have made this a 5 for me.
0783222955|4.0|I had loved the book of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and we were made to watch this film in English class. I found it very touching, owing to all the performances of the actors, particularly that of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. The Tom Robinson trial was handed with sensitivity, as was the reclusive Boo Radley. The moral messages still came through as strong as the novel, and though some essential parts were left out, it still was an exceptional film that tugged at the heartstrings and left a satisfied taste in the mouth.
B000006045|5.0|An amazing bunch of songs by what I would consider to be the best trip-hop group there is.  The first four songs are simply astonishing, and the rest of the album works together great.  An essential album for any fan of the genre.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Due to my carelessness of trusting &quot;critics&quot;,who most of the time turn out to be quite off the &quot;point&quot;...i missed this masterpiece. I regret not having seen such a classic on the wide screen at the cinema. However by chance,i saw it on the plane during a biz trip..i watched it over and over through out the whole course of the flight...i could not help myself from crying when Satine was at her last breath. And suddenly I came to realise, &quot;love&quot; when its 'true', is frankly something quite very 'simple'. Many on the otherhand, I guess think otherwise --assuming it to be that of a 'complex' nature. The reason i say what I say is simply due to the the critism of which the movie had received -- being a very &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;sappy&quot; love story. But hey, isn't love &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;sappy&quot;...and thus what is wrong with it being so? Remember that these are the things that make us &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;hopeful&quot;. And I must admit that it was quite refreshing to actually see one of those &quot;classic&quot; love stories come to life on the screen again - and that of which was so magically done! The actor/actresses were breathtaking...the music was so moving, so creative and so well sung...as a lover of the arts...i was blown away. I especially would like to give my highest regards to &quot;Nicole&quot;...&quot;you are an amazing actress&quot;and of course, &quot; Baz&quot;, I would love to be inside your head.....you are one dedicated genious&quot;. Sweet, lovely, moving...so much talent...simply the best i have yet seen in a long time! I feel truly sorry for those -- especially the &quot;critics&quot; -- who cannot see that 'love' is actually something quite simple.<BR>Moulin Rouge...CARPE DIEM!
B00004XOWM|4.0|Limp Bizkit is my favourite band of all nu-metal band, and I have to admitt that Chocolate Starfish is a really limp album from Limp. Fred is saying on the website that their new album that they are recording will be their and us next level, it will be more heavy than Three Dollar Bill to he says. Well we just have to wait and see. Are you the real fan as I am, then you should buy this!!!
0812550757|5.0|Card maintains his throne in the oligarchy of good modern fiction. Speaker for the Dead is a marvelous continuance of Ender's Game. It is gracefully followed by Xenocide, then Children of the Mind (which I'm finishing now).<BR>Card is wonderful both for a great read and for providing true insights on life and living together.<BR>Perhaps what I'd most recommend, however, in Maps in a Mirror: the Short Fiction of Orson Scott Card. The hardback is out of print, but it's being re-released in four softbacks. There are stories are from all genres, and he provides his inspirations and insights for the stories, which is wonderful. Imagine - Card doing horror!
B00003CXSP|2.0|After Silence of Lambs,this film is a bad surprise for me.
B00005AFVR|2.0|I have three major problems with this release.  <br />1.)  The mix is awful!  It sounds like mud.  The piano and organ are drowned out by the guitars, and the vocals override everything else in the mix.  Finally, is that really The Boss singing?  Doesn't sound like it to me.<br />2.)  The performances are uneven.  Some performances, such as Two Hearts, Badlands, Born To Run, &amp; Out In The Street are too far over the top and sound as if the band was purposely trying to record a live album within a very short window, rather than let it loose and pick the best performances.  Some performances, such as 10th Avenue Freeze-Out are truncated =&gt; only Patti is given anything more than a hand-wave during the introductions. Finally, many performances, such as Jungleland, The River, Born in the USA, are just plodding.  They're not the songs I've grown to love.  Only Murder, Inc., Youngstown (though muddy), and Lost in the Flood are worthy performances for this release.<br />3.)  The track list and order is bizarre and annoying.  Why can't The Boss just give us something that halfway resembles a complete show?  His shows have unity, pacing, high points, and higher points.  This hasn't yet translated to his live releases.<br />Too bad.  This could have been one of the great live recordings.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|In Memento, Guy Pierce plays a former insurance investigator with a rare form of amnesia trying to track down his wifes murderer. What seperates Memento from Dana Carvey's comically fumbling opus &quot;Clean Slate,&quot; which had an eerily similar plot, is that Pierce's amnesia is based only around short term memories, which can be as frightningly annoying at times to the viewer as it is to Pierce. Memento also wreaks havoc with the usual time continuom, much in the same way that Pulp Fiction did, tracing it's characters personal history backwards. For the most part this works to great effect in creating an intriguing scenario and thickened suspense, although at times it neccessitates that the plot be overly simplified just so it's easier for the viewer to try to correctly piece everything together chronologically. This brings me to the major faults of Memento. Since the main character doesn't really know who anybody else is, neither do we. The characters are all paper thin and nothing more than shadows, leaving the viewer a little hollow. On top of the poorly (although albeit neccessarily so)defined characterization, the movie ends abruptly and somewhat unreasonably. The conclusion actually negates the importance of everyone we've been introduced to, and implodes what little we actually did know about them. The general feeling we are left with is one of emptiness, as if the previous hour was all just a waste of time. Understandably, this brings us closer to experiencing Pierce's feelings, but is ultimately detrimental. It seems like the writer was stretching for one last plot twist, ala Usual Suspects, that just wasn't feasible. Overall, the first three quarters of Momento is a four star movie, the last quarter is just sort of ridiculous.
B00005NW02|1.0|I don't get this band.  Why so popular?  \\"Toxicity\\" is the worst song that I have ever heard.
B00005LC6Z|5.0|If you're familiar with this sequel (the best of the series), then you know Michael Myers dies in the end.  As far as I'm concerned, he should have STAYED DEAD instead of having the scriptwriters &quot;bring him back from the grave&quot; for the later sequels.<br />To me, this is the final chapter of John Carpenter's horror series.  Dino DeLaurentiis works his magic (as he did with DUNE) in this, the best horror sequel ever.  What Carpenter started, DeLaurentiis finished.  Never mind the fact that this is just another slasher film.  This is one horror film that will leave you on the edge of your seats to the very end.  I'd like to think of &quot;Halloween II&quot; as the last of a two-part miniseries.<br />For maximum effect, please watch both Halloween movies on Halloween, October 31 and time it so &quot;Halloween II&quot; ends exactly at midnight, the morning of November 1.<br />Rest in pieces, Michael!
0062502182|5.0|Having heard many good things about Paulo Coelho and having an interest in modern literature, I picked up The Alchemist.  From the very beginning his very fluid writing caught my interest, and at times I had trouble putting this book down. He achieves quite a bit in terms of character and thematic development very concisely, and his writing never becomes drawn out or boring.  This book rates very highly on my list, and I definitely recommend it.
0195067142|4.0|My generation was late even for the Vietnam war. So when we want to understnd war, we ar indebted to authors such as E.B. Sledge, who describe in vivid detail what it was like to live through the &quot;meat grinder&quot; of battle. It is too much to say I envy the soldiers who fought in the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa, described in this book. The author's descrition is too true-to-life to admit such a comment. But it is not too much to say that one comes to admire the sacrifice and courage of men who fought these battles. Mr. Sledge's book is a great gift to those who never have had to put their lives on the line for thier country -- it informs and humbles us. I expect this book is also a great gift to those who have endured the crucible of battle -- it articulates their common experience.
0790743132|5.0|It is great to see the most classic romance movie of Hollywood in DVD.  The casting was superb, the best of all time.  Most important behind the scene information was the director, film crews and most actors in this movie were actually affected by the Nazi.  They were fleeding for their live and later got to be in this movie, so you can see the high moral spirit in this movie.  It not just a romance movie about love between two people.  It is a movie about social responsibilities, and greater love for the country, people and principle they fought for.  It is a great movie to see and learn and understand.  Though it was black and white movie, but the cinemaphotography was the best of its time.  Ingrid Bergman superb beauty and cherisma just made tough guy even like Humphrey Bogart melted. This movie had made Humphrey to be a romantic icon since then. This movie is a must to collect DVD!

B00003CXDZ|5.0|I had never thought that Nicole Kidman is beautiful nor she can sing.  This movie had gave me a big surprise.  Nicole was actually at her best, she was shinning like a diamond!  She had the sad, humour and joy emotions control brilliantly.  Not only she acted well, her singing was superb, simple fantastic.  <br />Ewan McGrepor has great voices, and the handsome look that matched well with Nicole, to make this movie with great romance, made to believe.  The best musical movie this year so far!  Great Director Lurmann to put up with such such a fantastic casting, setting, musical arrangement, cinemaphotography!
6303109950|5.0|Excellent characters chosen for this portrayal. Val Kilmer presents Doc Holiday in a sensitive, amusing manner. Kurt Russell very believable as Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott always a great character player in his many roles.  Use of many stars was a surprise to this viewer. I would recommend this movie to all action, Western lovers.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Never has a CD taken me more off guard than &quot;NIghtfall in Middle Earth&quot; did the first night I turned it on to give it a listen as I was going to sleep. I was a bit apprehensive, at first. Despite the numerous favorable reviews I had read, I had never before heard of the band Blind Guardian except from the website I had seen listing bands that had done songs based on the writings of Michael Moorcock. As I closed my eyes I listened to the first track (a dialogue/narrative). It lulled me into a kind of soft repose, and, since I had read BG were into incorporating folk instruments into their songs, expected to hear something soft and minstrel-like.<BR>&quot;...she, the mistress of her own lust&quot; and then the intro to &quot;Into the STorm&quot; erupted in my ears, and my eyes were wide open. Often, I have listened to a song, and at the end acknowledged to myself that it was quite unique, unlike any song I had heard before. Three notes into &quot;Into the Storm&quot; everything I thought I knew about heavy music crumbled to dust.  Songs &quot;The Curse of Feanor&quot; &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; &quot;Time Stands Still&quot; etc. only served to reinforce my conviction that I had found something truly awesome.<BR>&quot;Nightfall&quot; was just the beginning for me. After only one listen I was hooked to the furious, powerful melodies this band was able to create, and I am now a die-hard Blind Guardian fan. NIghtfall is among my all time favorite discs, and I recommend that anyone who is open-minded and looking for something ground-breaking and brilliant in the tired world of music give Blind Guardian the listen they deserve.
B000005DQR|5.0|DJ Shadow, along with Dan the Automator, Domino, and El Producto, is the foremost genius in a very select group of hip hop orchestrators.  &quot;Endroducing&quot; is the masterpiece by Josh Davis which moves through fourteen tracks that are undeniably original and emotionally efficacious despite the absence of lyrics or any sort of theme/story.  Apart from the definitive statement of &quot;Why Hip Hop Sucks in '96&quot; (&quot;It's the Money!&quot;) to a soulful futuristic funk groove, there is nothing tying the record together but sound motif and the listener's own inference. This proves to be more than enough.  &quot;Building Steam with a Grain of Salt&quot; and &quot;Midnight in a Perfect World&quot; are the two greatest testaments to the success of the samplers that musicians were smashing apart years ago in resistance to disco and hip hop. Shadow solidifies the DJ and hip hop as a true and very praiseworthy art-form, if only his position were reversed with Trick Daddy!
0345350499|5.0|Desire, mystery, adventure and deception -- these are a few of the many virtues that this epic novel holds within its grasp.  The Mists of Avalon is the tale of the Arthurian legends as you have never read them before, from the vantage point of the women.  The story is told primarily by Morgaine of the Fairies, Arthur's sister.  The glorious tale is of King Arthur coming to power and his life-long struggle between the two religions he is bound to, the old ways of the Goddess and the new Christianity.  While reading this book, the reader witnesses first hand everything that the Arthurian legends have to offer, from the crowning of King Arthur to the knights of his round table.<BR>   On the cover of the book, The Mists of Avalon is advertised as &quot;the magical saga of the women behind King Arthur's throne&quot;, that that claim really does not do the book justice.  The story is the magical saga of everyone behind and amongst King Arthur's court.  The author does such a magnificent job of describing the characters in her book that it would shortchange them all to mention just the women. The reader gets such a sense that what and whom he is reading about is real and true that one feels almost like he is sitting in Camelot's Great Hall while Arthur and his companions dine on the great feast of Pentacost.  Every detail of every event teems with life.  Another reason to recommend the book is the thick entwinement of the characters' relationships with each other.  While reading this book, one feels such a connection with the main characters as to truly feel their emotions.  To get involved with the characters' lives in The Mists of Avalon is truly a privilege that no one who loves to read should miss. The one reason that anyone might disagree with this heartfelt recommendation is that some might think that there is too much detail in the book, that it is too wordy.  This thought slanders the very essence of the book and the reason for what makes it so great.  The Mists of Avalon is a book to be savored, not devoured.  The bottom line is that this book has everything for everyone.  If one loves adventure, you will find yourself right along side Lancelot fighting the evil dragon that haunts King Pellinore's lake.  If you are a feminist, you will delight in the retelling of a story that historically is a tale of masculine dominance into one that gives the perspective that women will always rule over men, in some way or another.  If one loves romance, you will be enthralled by the clandestine love affair between Lancelot and the High Queen Gwenhwyfar.  And finally, if you are a person that loves a climactic ending, well, you'll just have to read the book to find out what's in store for you!
B000021YQV|5.0|After their first release it felt like we finally have the band who can deliver loud, aggressive and intelligent music. After Toxicity, it's already a fact that no one can get these guys down from the very top. System of a Down is heavy, aggressive, theatrically sarcastic and - as something we haven't seen so far - very deep. Both their lyrics and music use their rich Armenian heritage as a creative source... which is especially vivid in Science and Arto. If you like hard and speedy music, being at the same time sick and tired of all the commercial pretty dolls around, then you have the found the right band. This Armenian band is the truly the best in today's rock music.
B00005K3OT|4.0|A movie that is refreshing in hollywoods manufacturing machine.  Juliette Binoche saves her career after The English Patient from drool predictable &quot;blockbusters&quot; by taking this subtle title role.  Johnny Depp is his usual magnificent self. <br />Actors--Excellent<BR>Story--Refreshingly different<BR>Look--Classic
0452282152|3.0|I read this book back in April as part of a book group; I don't know if I would have picked it up otherwise, being naturally contrary and suspicious of success.  The writing is good, and the plot is O.K., but about halfway through it started to lose me, enough so that I forgot to read the last chapter and didn't notice until several days later, when I was putting it away.  Griet's attempts to stifle her emotions in various scenes seem to have the same stultifying effect on the entire atmosphere of the novel.  (Except, of course, for my wanting to kill the eldest child of the house, who is truly a little snot.)  For those wanting a far more entertaining fictional account of Holland at about the same time, I wholeheartedly recommend _Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister_ by Gregory Maguire.
B000000ORE|5.0|Tesla's debut album &quot;Mechanical Resonance&quot; blew me away. Rarely had I ever heard such a straight ahead, quality hard rock sound. Well, with this second effort the songs are every bit as good. Of course I love the radio songs--the top 10 quality (not cheesy) ballad &quot;Love Song&quot;, the also slower tempo but excellent &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, and the gritty &quot;Heaven's Trail (No Way Out)&quot;. However, every other song on this album RULES too! Like with the first album, I could rave about each and every track. &quot;Hang Tough&quot; is an awesome heavy start to the album, &quot;Lady Luck&quot; just screams with attitude, &quot;Lazy Days, Crazy Nights&quot; is a party rocker, and &quot;Paradise&quot; is just one amazing anthem with a great softer side but a very uptempo ending--a true masterpiece of a song. Anyone who likes straight ahead, heavy, and yet melodic rock and roll should definitely own this one. A truly underrated classic.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|This Movie is the first review for me on a movie so please bare with me. Ghostbusters the Movie is one Super Movie. Many ideas in this movie were based on the study of Ghosts and such. Much of the charctor of this movie that Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and Sigourney Weaver add a great depth to the charctors and plot of this movie. There seems to be nothing lacking in this movie. Even the music in the movie is classic. Let me now review this dvd in detail:Movie charctors: This is where this movie stood out the most. Bill Really knew how to make the humor come out. There is so much to talk about in this movie. The extra charctors for little screens is another thing that made this movie such a hit.  ..  . . .100% Movie Plot: The story is pretty good tho I sometimes question some screens and over all I had wished they had left in the Pott /Ramis love thing. It hurt a tad. But over all this movie has a great Plot. . . . .95%   Movie effects: Some of the best of the 80's anyways. Most effects worked great and made the movie work but once or twice I didn't really think the effect really did it's job.  . . . .90%Dvd features: This one is good on this note. The deleted Scenes were not so good to me but the Commentary did work well. The drawings you also get to see really shows you how deep this movie was.  . . . . .95%If you like this movie I suggest: Ghostbusters 2, Candyshack, SNL in the 70's - early 80's.
B000003TAL|5.0|This album took me about three or four listens until I finally began to see what the big deal was. It's a very long record, and the length can take its toll at first. The noisy feedback and shifting song structures will take some getting used to, but after a while, it sinks in. And when I played this album for that fourth time, I was blown away. The songs are very noisy, but also very melodic at the same time. And nobody has used feedback and weird noises the way Sonic Youth have. For instance, the ending section of \\"The Sprawl\\" uses gritty noises and feedback with harsh chords to create something strangely beautiful and powerful. The most instantly loveable song is the incredible opener \\"Teenage Riot\\" which never sounds too long or too short. \\"Total Trash,\\" \\"Silver Rocket,\\" \\"Cross The Breeze,\\" \\"Eric's Trip,\\" the Trilogy, and the songs I mentioned before are required listening. Purchase this, give it some time, and you'll be glad...
6303215734|5.0|I'd prefer not to echo the praise this film receives from seemingly everyone, but I've always been fascinated by its continuing, and growing, appeal to modern audiences....so I suppose the next few echoes you hear will just be me, throwing somebody else's two cents in.<br />The Bedford Falls of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has never really existed - that's hardly a news flash. Bedford Falls is childhood and innocence tucked away in the safe harbor of the past, a deeply comforting fantasy composed of equal portions of wish-fulfillment and nostalgia: a fantasy which summons our better angels, lifting us out of dog-eat-dog mundanity and towards a picture-postcard version of the Ideal. It's this first half of IAWL that chafes against the jaded postmodern sensibility that seeks always to justify and celebrate aberrance, even evil, in the name of 'understanding'; a generation whelped on wrestling, gangsta-rap, South Park and Howard Stern (all of which get brushed under the rug as 'harmless fun') is hardly likely to respond to Capra's idealistic Everytown with anything beyond bemused contempt. The second half - the dark, slightly creepy, Twilight Zone portion of the film - exerts a far more seductive pull on modern moviegoers. Well, let's face it, Pottersville is what contemporary America IS; it's what people have gotten used to, at least, in many cases convincing themselves is preferable to some candyass Norman Rockwell never-neverland. (Because it's 'real', you see; and consistent with this ghetto existentialism, harsh &amp; ugly 'reality' trumps every other kind.) Has anyone ever noted that while Bedford Falls is obviously a studio creation, the camera pans across the nightmarish neon marquees dotting Pottersville might be stock footage of any postwar American city? That contrast, that wrenching emotional dichotomy, is what strikes such a chord within those of us who love this film without reservation, as does Capra's message in IAWL: that Bedford Falls is within reach of us all if we love our friends and family, stay the course despite setbacks, treat others with kindness and respect...and believe in God. <br />The simple key that unlocks this film is belief in God; having steadfast faith in a benevolent Higher Power which views each human life as precious &amp; important. Capra &amp; Stewart were both troubled by currents of cynicism making strong inroads into American life after WW2, particularly wanting to combat a creeping purposelessness they saw as rooted in atheism (which always becomes fashionable after wartime). Though not made as a Xmas attraction per se (not a single depiction of clergy in the entire damn film!), IAWL promotes a belief in God as the vital glue of conscience, family, community, nation  - without which all our Bedford Falls would be inevitably subsumed into Pottersvilles. Give Capra credit for managing to impart this message subtly, despite all the angels, answered prayers and celestial voice-overs he has woven into the story fabric. (Maybe TOO subtly, as the movie tanked on first release, eventually tumbling into the public domain.) Though lately such strong endorsement of religious faith is considered cultural anathema (at least according to the empty suits running film studios), nevertheless IAWL now seems impossible to resist to audiences unceasingly bludgeoned with entertainment built upon callousness, carnality and previously-unthinkable levels of brutality. (Which is why the notion of a remake is utterly laughable: even teenagers who don't 'get' old black &amp; white movies are intuitive enough to grasp that this kind of deep-rooted sentiment properly belongs to a different America - the America contemporary Hollywood has taught them to despise.) <br />Though everyone rightfully focuses on Jimmy Stewart's truly stunning performance as George Bailey, it's worth noting that this might be Capra's finest hour as a filmmaker. There's no exotica a la LOST HORIZON or showy MR SMITH filibusters on view; WONDERFUL LIFE is more introspective and mellow a film, Capra in a muted key. But every setpiece is staged and photographed expertly, and all the big payoffs resonate with honest and powerful emotion. The scene with young George Bailey and the drunken, grief-crazed druggist is as beautifully done as any in Capra's long career, and that's just the first of many high points here: the lovingly-shot nostalgia of the farewell dance; George &amp; Mary's tentative, slowly-building love scene as they share a phone call from a friend; the sick, shamed look of helplessness on George's face directly following his violent tantrum in front of his kids. All are indelible moments that cling to your memory for a lifetime, and Capra seems to have been saving them all up for this movie. Yet perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the film is the inability of film critics - otherwise at a loss to explain its strong hold over an increasingly secular public - to resist 'interpreting' it for the new millenium. Thus, the endless 'cutting-edge' bromides one reads that patiently explain how IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a 'dark' film with a pessimistic view of American middle-class aspirations &amp; values...even an indictment of them! Yet somehow, year after year, millions of viewers faithfully watch it for the umpteenth time, reaffirming those same values, laughing and crying along with George, losing and finding their religion through the proxy of George's suffering and renewal. It took a while for Capra &amp; Stewart's favorite film to finally do what they'd hoped it would - speak to an audience, and help give it faith to believe &amp; strength to abide - but once WONDERFUL LIFE got its bearings and began gathering momentum, not a day goes by that this remarkable movie isn't earning its wings somewhere in the world.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I really want to let all you people, who don't have written on here that Britany will just fade away like New Kids on the Block. Your so very wrong! That pop is just a fad, your wrong! Have you noticed that the more you put her down the more she just comes back! Britany is great! She is a great person, beautiful and very lucky! I have to say that yes I am jelous of her, but I realize that I should just put her down, but listen to her and she what she is about plus if I had her body I'd be doing the same stuff and you would too! Britany is a strong girl and will keep taking what you all say about her! I love her and her music and thinks that she puts on one hell of a show on each MTV VMA's and hopes she continues to do so. I think what we have her is the next Madonna in a type and look what everyone said about her. But you all have your opinons and can feel what you want. But your just jelous. I mean you think pop will fade.. Where is Silver Chair and those bands, don't you think every type of music has its share of flops... She isn't one of them. Neither is Nsync but as for christina and bbs... say what you want.. haha This cd. is better than the 1st, but still i know her next will be her best!
0385501560|5.0|First, I must say I am very proud that I can spell Chuck's last name, hehehe.... That is a must if you are trying to find his works in a bookstore. Choke is another great work from the author that brought us the plot to the movie Fight Club. In Choke, Chuck is again able to write an action packed novel witha  surprisng, gut-renching plot, that keeps the reader hooked until the last page. My only problem with it: the price. The novel is short, because it gets to the point. My suggestion is to try out some of Chuck's other works and come back to the book when it becomes available in paperback for. However if you are a die-hard chuck fan that forget the price and just enjoy!!!!
B00005JHAD|4.0|From the other reviews here, you either loved it or hated it. Personally...I loved it. There are several interconnected storylines that play off of each other, creating the movie. If you don't like deadpan/British humor (verbal and action), you probably won't get half of the jokes. Guy Ritchie made an extremely clever movie that's enhanced by the sndtrk and the fact that the actors fit their characters.
0380789019|5.0|A friend of mine, who is usually not a fantasy reader, told me about this book. At first, I was hesitant because I have never heard of this author, however, I was soon to find out I made a very good choice. Gaiman crafts a wonderful story with a truly original plot (which is really saying something considering how impacted this industry is). But what makes this book even more wonderful is that Gaiman does not disappoint the imaginary plot because he crafts beautiful, realistic characters that the reader can completely bond with. He evokes real emotions and inputs them into his characters which makes it so that we, the reader, cannot help but become linked to the story. If you are hesistant, like I was, then let me reassure you that Gaiman is a true genius and you are definitely in good hands. After reading this work, check out his Sandman graphic novel series, they are breathtaking!
0780626494|5.0|One of the better DVDs to come out reciently!! If you like love movies staged in the 1950s with a unique plot, then you will like this. The wife and I both enjoy this DVD.
0385474547|5.0|This book is wonderful in it's simplicity of prose. The plot isboth simple in the read and complicated in its implications. Living in America, we are unaware of the lives of people in other countries. Achebe's work is an eye opening introduction to the effect of colonialism from the eyes of those being colonized. We get to view through the eyes of someone of that culture and see what western society's 'changes' mean to them. Although the work is short (around 200 pages), Achebe was able to evoke a setting of an African tribe that should be unfamiliar to us, something that we can both understnad and place ourselves in. This book is definitely with great merit and makes us hesitate about our position to standby when unjustices are being meted out around the world. Enjoy, ponder, and take a stand!
0380973650|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a master. His stories are well-crafted, magical, works of fiction that are impossible to put down.<br />Do your self a favor and read everything he has done, you'll be a better person for it ;-)
B000021YQV|1.0|I am not sure what the previous reviewers considered cutting-edge, interesting, and above all 'intellectual', but if this album has one overall theme, it is that it sucks! I bought this based on faith from the testimony of reviewers, and on hearing the single 'Chop Suey' - this was a huge waste of money, which would have been better used if I had flushed it down the toilet or burned it. <br />Anyone who can even compare these hacks and Tool obviously does not know all that much about music, has NEVER played music, and is looking for an alternative niche. If you are into 'nichey' groups, that is, groups that no one likes or has heard of, jump aboard the latest alternative bandwagon. For those of you who like metal, it generally follows suit that you like one of the following elements: complex rhythms and melodies, great guitar playing, or something completely different without being contrivedly novel. <br />Bottom line: I am not sure who you people are who like this band, or what school has passed you to the 8th grade, but this album is not interesting, different (unless you consider annoying different), or intellectual (neither lyrically or musically). Sorry System boys, but the sooner you are gone the better.
B00004T0P1|5.0|This cd always invokes fear and exhileration into my mind no matter how many times I listen to it.  I especially like Tracks #2, 4, 6, and 8.  What a great buy!!!  You won't be dissapointed!!!  I found it even better than the Lion King!!!
B000006TRV|5.0|I own the cd and the concert. Nuff said
B000002BFZ|5.0|Arguably Pearl Jam's best album, No Code is their most focused and thematic to date. While the music jumps (sometimes in the frame of a single song) from Neil Young to Led Zeppelin to punk, the cryptic lyrics hint at the spiritual searching that Cat Stevens knows all too well. \\"Seek my part,\\" Vedder sings in Sometimes, \\"Devote myself.\\" This album actually has a lot of the same intentions that U2's Joshua Tree did, but Pearl Jam knows a subtlety that Bono finds anethemic and U2 has a bombast that is more accessible than Pearl Jam are willing to be. Bono also desperately wants to lead you to the promised land, whereas Ed would just as soon meet you there by way of your own chosen route.<br />Ed Vedder's experiences in the early 1990's actually remind me of a moment from Monty Python's Life of Brian movie. \\"I'm not the messiah!\\" He exclaimed, and while critics hunted him down (basically for NOT being Kurt Cobain), fans cried out \\"You are the messiah! I should know, I've followed a few!\\" And the song Sometimes, occupying the first 2 minutes or so of No Code, seems to me to be Ed's way of finally realizing that those people can't effect him if he doesn't let them. From there he's free to contemplate any number of things. Thoughts on life, death, and beyond coat this album like thick paint, dripping off of every edge and refusing to dry. One strong point of No Code is that for the first time on a Pearl Jam album these grandiose thoughts don't demand to be answered, they merely ask to be recognized and pondered. The low-fi recording fits this new perspective the way Tom Waits' music fits his personality, which is to say it couldn't be done any other way. Off He Goes, during which you can almost smell the incense burning, would sound silly with massive overdubs and echo. Present Tense cleaned up would seem like it was being a lot less honest with you. Also appropriate for the album is the erratic emotional and sonic landscape. Hail Hail almost seems like a seizure followingSometimes, and the transition from adrenaline-fueled punk to quiet contemplation that is Lukin and Present Tense makes the later seem all the more intimate.<br />Strangely coming immediately after the death-obsessed Vitalogy (this barely sounds like the same band, let alone like it could be the very next release), recorded by a group that was barely speaking to each other, and not as influenced by side projects with Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn and Neil Young as some people would have you believe, No Code is one of the most beautiful nods to life that I have ever heard. Audiophiles rejoice, for this was the day that Pearl Jam truly joined our ranks.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This disappointing and emotionally bankrupt take on Dec. 7, 1941 pulls out every manipulative trick in the book -- the soldier who comes back from the dead, the love triangle, the hokey ending -- and yet still fails to ultimately engage the viewer.<br />The 40-minute battle scene, seen as the best part of the movie by most reviewers, is undeniably stunning. But for all of the technical prowess and craft displayed, the combat itself takes on a video game-type quality lacking in the visceral emotions that one would expect to experience in a war movie. To me, this was the Disneyfication of Pearl Harbor. One of the most brutal days in American history, and yet most of the blood is not up close and in your face, it's comfortably in the background, perhaps not to offend their apparent target 15-year-old girl Titanic audience. Even the hospital scenes have a gauzy white sheen between us and the wounded, a technique that does not work and further removes us from the action. The scenes of soldies being strafed while swimming in the water could have been far more powerful, but in this rendition the bodies look like ants on the screen. Worse yet, unlike in Titanic, where we came to know the cast and were thus interested in their various fates, the main characters here are removed from the action, until they stage an improbable (but somewhat true to history) aerial defense with two planes. To the viewers, the deaths of thousands of soldiers has about the same impact as a laser rifle striking down a Storm Trooper in Star Wars, because we don't know the soldiers in the thick of the action -- they are merely fodder for the special effects.<br />As far as the ship capsizing scenes, it was extremely Titanic-derivative.<br />The love story, which takes up an astounding 2 hours of the 3-hour epic, is neither horrible nor good; it's simply pedestrian. You don't spend $200 million on a movie for pedestrian, do you? There are plenty of hokey plot developments, oodles of laughable dialogue, and some bad accents thrown in for good measure.<br />The thing about this movie is, despite all of my complaints, I actually came out of the theater thinking that it was pretty good -- a three star flick. But over time, the visual impact of the special effects fades and you are left with disappointment in a war movie that wasn't, a $200 million mediocre piece of schlock that gets its by-the-numbers two stars, but ultimately a missed opportunity for greatness. (I would have loved to see the James Cameron version of P.H.!)<br />By the way, watching this movie on video or DVD will likely lessen the impact even more, since those special effects will be reduced and those ant-soldiers will become dust-mite soldiers. If you are going to watch P.H., at least watch it on the big screen.<br />Last week, I saw Apocalypse Now Redux, which, while it shares a three-hour-plus length, is ten times better than Pearl Harbor. If you want to see what a real war movie looks like, do yourself a favor and watch Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Vitalogy isn't just the closest Pearl Jam ever came to deserving the \\"grunge\\" title unfairly heaped upon them, it's also one of the most maddening and disillusioned records of the 1990's. Despite losing focus occasionally (Spin the Black Circle, Betterman) and the fact that most of the albums quirky moments are heaped onto the second half (Aye Davanita, the disturbing Bugs), Vitalogy is powerfully singular in it's goal. The album is Pearl Jam's first step away from making records that were basically a bunch of songs together on a disc. It has an underlying theme, reaffirmed by and controlling every aspect of the album from the guitar tones to the album art, and giving it mood and dimension that the first two records lack. In that respect, it was Pearl Jam's first step into a larger world. \\"Tremors turn to quakes,\\" from Tremor Christ, may be the best summary of this album anyone can hope to offer.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is a towering achievement that causes nearly all other rock albums to pale in comparison. The third best-selling album of all time (after The Eagles greatest hits and Thriller), the Wall tells the tale of an angry young man who was verbally abused as a child, and consequently builds up &quot;The Wall&quot; to protect himself. Each attack on his young psyche results in &quot;Another Brick in the Wall.&quot;<BR>As the angry young man grows up, The Wall interferes with his relationships and some pretty weird stuff happens. At one point, the wall is so complete that the man becomes, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; -- a chilling thought that still sends shivers up my spine. I always envision that serial killers become &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; before they are able to kill people with dispassion, again and again. Ultimately The Wall is a story about a child who just wanted to be loved and isn't, and on this level anyone can relate to it.<BR>Aside from perhaps Tommy, how many other two-volume sets in Rock tell a complete vision of a single story? None that I'm familiar with. <BR>Aside from the depth and resonance of the material, the music is also mesmerizing, powerful and deeply disturbing. Spare instrumentals, the use of sonic sounds like breaking glass and busy signals as music, are all far more original than any of the rock-schlock that has been released in the past 20 years. I could list all of the great songs on the record, but that would be pointless. To me, the amazing thing is that there are no BAD songs on this record!<br />So, go out and buy this, and, maybe, ten years from now, The Wall can overtake Thriller and The Eagles as having the No. 1 best-selling album of all time. It would certainly be worthy of that title.
B00005BCOL|5.0|MAGNIFICENT!!!  This movie has it all...love, lies, deceipt, scandals...mixed with enough vamp and bitchiness to entertain the most descriminating oldies movie watcher. You'll love the characters, the plot, the clothes, the catchy never-to-be-forgotten one-liners...from start to finish. I've seen it on TV, rented it and now am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my very own copy from Amazon! Oh, hurry UPS man....or someone &quot;bring me a bromide...and put some gin in it!&quot;
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Those who argued that the plot would make no sense, or be inconsistent if the movie was shown &quot;forwards&quot; should get the dvd... it has an option to watch the film &quot;chronologically&quot; by scene. It is wicked to watch it this way, after having watched the film the way it was intended... Furthermore, the movie makes complete sense watched this way. (though it is way less effective) This movie is just plain wonderful. Watch it now.
0452282152|4.0|&quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; by Tracy Chevalier is an interesting and intriguing book. It begins in 1664 in Delft when a young girl from a low class family named Griet meets the painter Vermeer and his wife Caterina for a job interview. This book is very hard to put down once started. It is suspenseful in a non action way so that the reader is hopeful to find out what happens next. It also shows the reader the conflicts between rich and poor, and Catholic and Protestant. Griet leaves her Protestant family at the age of sixteen to work as a maid for the Catholic family of Vermeer. Griet needs to help her family make more money as her brother does. Griets father is unable to work because of an accident with the kiln that made him blind. From the moment that Vermeer met Griet there was a connection that upsets everyone in the household especially his wife Caterina. Because of this Griet has many obstacles in which the family makes her work very difficult, but that does not stop the unspoken love that Griet and Vermeer have for each other that is never revealed.  This book was very controversial in showing the conflicts between rich and poor, and catholic and protestant. family that is not wealthy, Griet has to maintain who she is and where she comes from while liking in a completely different life. There  are times when Griet is unable to understand things about the family and assumes it is because they are catholic. She is not used to the detailed ways the Vermeer family portrays the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and is upset when there is a picture of it at the foot of her bed. There is also conflict between rich and poor. Griet is not used to living with people of such high class. There are times when Griet is with the children of the Vermeer family and she sees her sister in the market. Griet is embarrassed and ashamed of how shabby looking her sister is and ignores her regrettably. She is afraid that the children will be mean, as most of the usually are.Griet has many problems with Cornelia, the second oldest child. Cornelia makes the book more suspenseful and interesting with her sly ways of framing Griet and some how getting in her trouble because no one trusts a poor maid. The most conflict begins when Vermeer paints Griet, not as a maid and not as a wealthy woman either. The entire Vermeer household goes ballistic when Griet wears Caterinas pearl earring. No one can stand that someone with no importance is able to wear Caterinas earring. Through all the conflicts and hard times that Griet goes through, Griet still stands strong and does what she believes, even though at times she may give in along the way. Griet and Vermeer have this love that is never really fulfilled.  Many readers may criticize the book because Griet and Vermeer are never together, although they love each other.  Their love is never spoken of or acted upon, but is defiantly there.  Many may not like that they restrain their feelings and dont express their love.  Vermeer is attracted to Griet from the moment they meet, when he notices her love for art.  Griet is very attracted to him as well, and loves his art spending many nights admiring it alone.  The love part of the story should not be criticized, but praised.  Griet and Vermeer restrain their feelings and have the discipline to not act upon their feelings.  the reader may not realize the strength they both have to keep their love unspoken because of the consequences which would ruin them both as done before to others in the book.  This book is well written with a good love story added to a interesting books.  It is highly recommended and enjoyed.
0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chbosky's eye opening and realistic first novel, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, was a great book in many ways. First of all, it captures your attention, both with the characters and with ALL the things that happen to them. Second, Charlie, although on the verge of being an outcast but not quite there, has a voice that you feel compelled to listen to once you start. And third, the book is realistic and heartfelt, and as a person who entered her first year of high school six days ago, I feel I have it easy compared to him (all I am is bored. If you listen to the things he goes through...). I enjoyed the book very much and keep a copy in my locker at school to look at before class. I encourage you to read this book if you can find the time amidst all your new English reading assignments.
B00005NW02|3.0|After buying the great debut album of System of a down, I recently heard the single being played on the radio of &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; and sounded just like the old SOAD that I grew to love, and after buying the CD and listening to it a few times it began to grow on me, but it lacks the rythm the first CD had.  Its amazing how SOAD makes the phrase &quot;All research and successfu drug policy show that treatment should be increased, and law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory mininum sentences&quot; (from the Prison Song) sound like music, but they somehow pull it off.  Malakian's voice in some of the songs makes me crack up, and adds to the enjoyability of the CD.  While this is a great CD to add to your collection, if you haven't heard the original SOAD, make sure you buy it, it is a true masterpiece.
B00003CY3W|1.0|Ok, I should say right up front that I went to high school with Dan Clowes who scripted Ghost World.  I sat in the same art class that he based scenes from this movie on, so it was kind of neat to see a piece of my life up there on the screen.<br />But the fun stopped there.  While all of the actors in this film where good, the characters they portrayed were hateful, and their story was a complete bore. Clowes' misanthrope characters may carry an issue or two of Eightball, but much like the comic, they become tiresome in their perpetual cynicism and outright hopelessness.<br />Twenty minutes into the film, people started voting with their feet.  Out of loyalty to Mr. Clowes, I white-knuckled it to the bitter end as his story of teenage angst hopelessly unraveled.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The only film that I can think of that comes even close to the ingenuity of Memento is The Usual Suspects. Like that way underappreciated classic, Memento gives you the ending immediately, and then spends the rest of its time showing you how it got there. Each scene offers clues and various revelations--Leonard's tattoos, why he writes what he does on Natalie's and Teddy's pictures, what happened to his wife, Leonard's job before &quot;the incident&quot;--each of which are thrilling mini-narratives in themselves.<br />The acting is first rate. Guy Pearce, best known as &quot;the one who wasn't Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential&quot;, is Leonard, a character who will intrigue you, engage your sympathy, and might even scare you by the end. Joe Pantoliano's Teddy will have you debating his intentions towards Leonard for days afterwards. The real acting coup, however, is fellow Matrix alum Carrie Anne Moss--her performace as Natalie will make you love her, hate her, and make you fiercely protective of her.<br />The movie can only be watched on DVD. Keep the remote handy as you'll want to pause every now and then, if only to read Leonard's tattoos for various clues. After watching the movie, be sure to check out Otnemem in the Special Features section for newspaper articles, pictures, journal entries, and psychiatric reports on Mementos intriguing characters. They will help confirm what you think happened in the movie.  DVD also offers the playful option of choosing to watch the movie backwards (or would it be watching the movie forward?). You will definitely consider the option after watching the movie. I haven't done it yet, but I can't wait to see the effect that it has on the movie.<br />This movie is worth the critical hype. If you enjoyed movies like The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, Seven, Fight Club, and Dark City (some of my personal faves), then Memento will be the crown of your DVD collection!
0743216458|5.0|If you have children who are 10 or older, you might consider reading this one aloud, sharing it as a family. The courage, the strength and heroism of the men in Easy Company make for a powerful story, one that deserves to be shared. And Ambrose's writing is irresistable, pulling the reader (and listeners) into the thoughts and actions of the soldiers.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Do you know what really makes me sick in this movie?... To see every minute on the screen the name of a famous Italian fashion designer. This is really where obscenity is in today Hollywood cinema.
B000002UV9|5.0|Ah, Queensryche, one of my favorite bands ever.  They make great music, and write lots of great songs about the rain.  They have not one, but TWO songs that mention rain!  Maybe more, at least I hope so.  This album has one of the best songs ever, &quot;Another Rainy Night Without You&quot;.  It's so emotional, and you can almost see the rain coming down.  Queensryche hails from Seattle, a place where it rains a lot, and if your girl leaves, you're going to have to go through a lot of rainy nights without her.  I love rainy nights, so it'd be okay by me.  If you love great music with empassioned vocals, and rainy lyrics, &quot;Empire&quot; is the album for you!
B00003CXPD|3.0|I really am not that impressed with a film that leaves the viewer NO room to form an opinion contrary to what you're &quot;Supposed to&quot; feel. The film's so formulatic that it's really sad. There are a few early scenes that show Billy's discovery of ballet that really are something special, but even these are cross cut with shots showing the police quelling a worker's rebellion. The biggest problem with the film is that Billy is meant to stand for more than he is. He's filling in as hope for an entire community here. His dad &amp; brother are resigned to being coal workers. His teacher has a failed marriage &amp; teaches for 50 pence a lesson. His gay friend feels stifled by his homosexuality and sees Billy as the only one who understands him. His grandmother had hopes of being a pro dancer, but never got the training. Taken one by one these subplots are fine, but the accumulation of them all makes the film feel so forced that it really hurts the overall impact of Billy's dancing glories. The film achieves its successes in the small moments of personal discovery; the rest seems unnecessary. <BR> <BR>The scenes simply work much better alone than in the framework of the picture where they all combine to form mush despite the fact that there is little mush contained in them individually. There's a good supporting performance by Julie Waters. The rest of the cast is fine if unexceptional. It's hardly an awful film, and I realize there is talent present, butI just with it wasn't all so damn manipulative.
B0000028M7|5.0|Grunge is one of my favorite kinds of music, and for a good reason.  As a lover of all things rainy, I enjoy anything having to do with rain.  Grunge comes from a very rainy place called Seattle, and the rain must inspire them, because they make lots of songs full of rainy goodness!  This album is no exception.  I love all the songs here, like &quot;Down in Hole&quot; and &quot;Rooster&quot;, but the best is definitely &quot;Rain When I Die&quot;.  It's long and slow, and great to play when it's raining outside.  I really hope it rains when I die.  I've lived all my life having to endure these stupid sunny days, and it would be nice if I'd get a little rain on my last day.  If you love rain, and grunge, you should buy this album.
B00005K3OT|1.0|Chocolat is awful. Juliette Binoche stars in the film (which gives her next to nothing to do), which is sort of \\"Where the Heart Is...\\" meets \\"The Full Monty.\\" It's a completely offensive liberal fantasy.  The basic plot is that a woman comes to a small town in 50's France, and through the power of her chocolate making, changes their outlook on lives.  The problem with this is that you need to share its viewpoint, which is that all of the townspeople are stupid &amp; blindly follow their way of life &amp; religion since they don't know any better.  <br />The film treats Catholicism as folly. I'm not Catholic, but I was still offended. It takes place during Lent. Binoche's character tempts all of the characters to break their Lenten vows with her chocolate, and this is seen as a good thing. She doesn't attend church &amp; seems to callously brush aside their views on religion. Basically her character's goal comes at the cost of the town's way of life, and we're expected to applaud that.  I just want to warn you that the film, while seemingly sweet, is incredibly subversive in the worst way. It manipulates the audience into accepting the offensive views it has, and then tries to beautify its ugly ideas with mood lighting. <br />If you watch the film with any sort of rational mind at all, you can't help but be offended. I'm up for magic realism as much as the next person, but this film doesn't work at all. I didn't read the book, but the film is so flimsy. For example, it doesn't explain why the chocolates have the effects they do at all. There's one flashback in which Binoche explains the Indians believed cocoa beans make people lose all their inhibitions. That's well &amp; good, but I don't lose all inhibition when I eat a Hershey's bar. There is obviously something different about HER chocolate and the film does nothing to explain it.<BR> <BR>What I had a huge problem with though were its attitudes toward society. It's one of those movies that celebrates vagrants atthe expense of people who are settled down in life, but then expects us to be happy when the main vagrants in the story all decide to settle down at the end. I don't mind that the film condemns the church &amp; the town's people so much as that it expects us to be happy when it betrays itself and decides these are good things.<BR> <BR>Also problematic is Judi Dench's character. She is presented as a fellow outcast from the town, but she is obviously influenced by what her daughter (the mayor's loyal assisstant) thinks of her. The film definitely wants to be subversive &amp; conformist at the same time, and you simply can't. The condescending way it treats the townspeople in and the pedestal it places Binoche &amp; Depp on both are ridiculous. The film is a total failure (though I'm sure people who don't much think about what they're watching are apt to enjoy it.)
B00003CXSM|4.0|I usually don't go for romantic flicks, but even so few were as enchanting as this one. It was a little predictable (but all romance movies mostly are) and some of the cute comedy was a bit flat - again, nothing I didn't expect. Matthew McCaughnehy (I know I'm spelling his name wrong) is always really good, in all his films, and he was endearing as the cute and responsible doctor opposite Jenniefer Lopez. Oddly enough, I expected to find her a bit irritating in this movie (even though I liked her other work) and was thankfully mistaken. She's really good, adding a lot of spark to this picture-perfect movie. The two main characters also have lots of chemistry, something that's sadly lacking lately. Scene stealers include the bumbling yet sweet Italian misfit Massimo, played by Justin Chambers, who is perfect. His character is almost ridiculous when first introduced, but provides endless humor. Chambers' bewildered grin and odd mannerisms redeen his otherwise annoying, yet cute, character. Also look out for Lopez' father in the film, whos name eludes me, he's very good too. Everyone is!<BR>Great dialogue, script, and acting. Much better than expected. Right up there with other romantic comedy favorites of mine, 'Sliding Doors' and 'Notting Hill', if a little silly. Worth checking out, definitely.
B00003CXRP|2.0|The trailer of this film does more of a job spoiling the film than any review could do, so if you've seen that, there's going to be little to surprise you in the film's  2 1/2 hour running time. <br />The main thing missing here would be a realistic resolution of the relationship between Hunt &amp; Hanks characters (we're told she's been through a lot of pain, but we don't really see it... there would be wounds on both sides caused by the idealizations of each other that are completely ignored). The whole film is really a setup for Hanks' return to society, but that's the part of the film that gets least developed. Instead, we get Tom Hanks as a Boy Scout becoming one with nature (culminating in a truly embarassing moment in which a whale swims up to Hanks and winks at him.)<br />During his stint on the island, Hanks implausibly talks to Wilson, a volleyball. This might sound refresingly quirky, but for me it was awful (at the very least the moment where Hanks snaps &amp; talks to him the 1st time was unbelievable). The film never really explores any of the psychological issues that a man that does such things must surely have. <br />The first 20 minutes of the film were awful, with Tom Hanks being the prototypical idealized American (bringing Elvis to the Russians, saving them from their own inefficiency, etc..) The casting of Tom Hanks appears to be the film's major characterization. The guy's obsessed with time, and loves his fiancé, but what else do we know about him? We're expected to assume he's an everyman solely by the typecasting of Hanks.<br />Those are all pretty major concerns in my book... I didn't HATE it, but it's hardly a success. I think that Cast Away spends roughly half its time off the island. It would be nice if the film actually created a believeable set of developed characters for Hanks to interact with when he was off the island. I don't<BR>think there are any decent characters in the film.<br />What *did* work for me was the decent direction, and the basic narrative. There's something inherently compelling about the situation, even if the movie screwed up on the specifics... I guess my basic complaint is that I've seen Fearless &amp; The Sweet Hereafter, etc... , which deal with this sort of thing in a much better, more realistic manner. A traumatic event like this has wide-ranging emotional effects. Those interest me a lot more than how someone opens a coconut with a rock.
B00000IMTE|4.0|Playing alongside Ronnie Dio, Blçackmore's outfit Rainbow released masterpiece after masterpiece (four of them) until running out of steem and begiining to work with horrible commercial / pop singer Joe Lynn Turner. It was not Joe's fault, it was Blackmore who wanted to make some money. He deserved it, by the way. THe guy is a genius, a total master of the electric guitar, a master from a time when the masters really played with conviction, very different from today &quot;masters&quot; like Satriani, Vai and Malmsteen. THis Rainbow debut is very good, altough Blackmore fired all the band (except Dio) after this album. I like all the songs, even the cover of BLCK SHEEP OF THE FAMILY. RISING is better, but this debut is a proud effort.
6305627347|5.0|Without the shackles of TV censorship, Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created a brilliant work of comedy art with this movie. Fans of the popular TV show will love this movie as it has every bit of the TV version's unique humor but with so much more...This movie is a musical! Seeing your favorite foul-mouthed foursome burst into song is an extremely hilarious experience. Many of the show's regular characters make it into the movie as well, including Jimbo, Ned, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Mackey and, of course, Chef. Buy it!!!
B000001ELP|4.0|MUSIC FROM THE ELDER is a fantastic concept album, no matter it was KISS who wrote it. The songs are killers, altough obvioulsy not written for FM consumption, what is a merit for KISS. I read that Eric Carr and ACe Frehley were totally against following that direction, and they must have tought that they were right, when record sales did not reach what was expected. But the album is great, believe me.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Dido's case reminds me a lot of Jewel in more than one respect. She's a fabulous female composer and singer, to begin with. But most important of all, she rose to true fame almost two years after the release of this her debut album, 'No Angel' (1999).<br />As for comparisons (they're inevitable in today's crowded arena of female vocalists) the style of the sister of Rollo (leader of Faithless) stands somewhere next to Natalie Merchant, Alanis Morrisette and Sarah McLachlan.<br />Contrary to popular belief, the single &quot;Thank You&quot; exhausted now after so much airtime, and a very popular version of it made in collaboration with Eminem is far from being the best track in the album. The opening track (&quot;Here with me&quot;) exhibits an unusual force, and the softer tunes, &quot;My Lover's Gone,&quot; &quot;Slide,&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot; are by far the best works in this album.
B000001EKX|3.0|Of course HOTTER THAN HELL is a classic KISS album, but that does not mean it is so great as some people say. IT's an average KISS album, when you still could see clearly their musicians' musical limits and the total dumbness of the lyrics. Anyway, KISS will always be KISS and, even being average for KISS standards, it's miles and miles better than most of the crap that is being released around nowadays !!
1569382603|4.0|In what amounts to a survey of some of the world's most extraordinary ancient sites, Hancock provides interesting though not always credible theories of a prehistoric monocivilization from which descended, he believes, civilizations as geographically and culturally diverse as those centered at Easter Island, Cuzco, Nazca, Tihuanaco, Teotihuacan, La Venta, Giza, and Angkor Wat.  Although, in my opinion, it's weak archaeology to opine pyramids as evidence of the same mother culture that produced Mexico, Peru, and Egypt, Hancock produces very intriguing evidence that all these cultures possessed astronomical knowledge of a very high order.  That they were obsessively concerned with astronomical precession is spooky; however, it doesn't help his case when Hancock comes up with some pretty elaborate and debatable rationales to make this point.  I suppose it's unrealistic to expect much more than conjecture about this kind of prehistory, but I'm not favorably disposed when I see a film that purports to be science but that was obviously made more for its entertainment value than for its scientific rigor.  Nevertheless, it's fun to be entertained in this way as long as one keeps a large grain of salt on hand.
B00003ZKS1|4.0|Fantastic 1980 debut by Mr. Schenker. I don't give it five stars only because the dumbness of the lyrics for ARMED AND READY is so great that defies any explanation...
0792837622|4.0|This was my first musical to watch with the intention of reviewing, so I am inexperienced at critiquing musicals.  I did enjoy watching the musical.  It is usually better when you watch a movie before you know the final outcome is going to be tragic, but it was still exciting enough to keep my attention.  The actors were as realistic as I could imagine one being to do such a persormance.  The songs set the tempo of the mood always.  It was fun.  I would try other musicals based on my initial experience with West Side Story.
B000002J1O|4.0|I've been a Genesis fan for somewhere around 15 years and there's really not that much material they've done that I haven't liked.  Selling England By The Pound, in my mind, is a special case.<br />When Genesis wrote and recorded Selling England By The Pound in 1973, they had just completed their most ambitious tour yet and had recorded what was to become one of their most beloved and complex pieces of music - \\"Supper's Ready.\\"  In 1974 they would face different challenges - an elaborate tour playing the conceptual double-album The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway and an uncertain future after lead singer Peter Gabriel goes solo.  But what emerged from the Selling England By The Pound sessions became a truly defining piece of music for pre-1975 era Genesis.<br />\\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" kicks off the album with gentle vocals and acoustic guitar but quickly builds into a progressive rock classic tapping each member of the band and receiving incredible performances from all.  <br />\\"I Know What I Like\\" became an instant Genesis classic and live crowd favorite.  While I don't believe it to be one of their best songs, it does capture the playful element of the band.<br />\\"Firth of Fifth\\" is, in my opinion, one of the defining songs of Genesis' career.  The song's lyrics are representative of the mystical, magical twist present in almost every song penned by Gabriel and company.  The instrumental passages embody all the musical talent the band had containing both keyboard and guitar-dominant pieces.  Phil Collins' drumming is full, crisp and incredibly powerful while Mike Rutherford lays out a strong bass line.  But if \\"Firth of Fifth\\" is representative of the mystical tone of Genesis' lyrics, \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" is representative of Gabriel's sense of humor.  This is a complicated piece of music but its tempered with a few very funny lyrics.  Instrumental passages are well done as well.<br />\\"More Fool Me\\" is a very short, soft piece driven by Phil Collins'pastoral vocals while \\"After The Ordeal\\" is a short instrumental piece.  The first half is dominated by Banks and Hackett while the second half shows all members in full participation.  The music is not all that complex by Genesis standards but it is a strongly emotional piece.<br />\\"The Cinema Show\\" and \\"Aisle of Plenty\\" (really one piece of music) are more masterpieces from the Genesis catalog.  \\"The Cinema Show\\" typifies all those things so great about the band from lyrics to instrumentation.  Its beautiful end provides the perfect climax to Selling England By The Pound.<br />So, while I would not say that Selling England By The Pound is Genesis' best album, I would say that it is a perfect example of what was so right about the band in the early 70's.  If I had to choose one album to use a representative snapshot of the Peter Gabriel era, this would be the one.
B00005KHJR|5.0|See the movie.  All this noise over which version is best, or which this one is, is irrelevant if you have never seen the movie before. This is a great story, with great acting, with a thought-provoking message, and a suprise ending. <br />What are the foundations of your faith? How do you define right and wrong? What impact have our spoon-fed religions had over us as we shaped our beliefs and set our paths into motion? In the moment of truth... how will your faith manifest itself?  Is neo-puritan rectitude (from a Christian point of view) more holy and desirable than a Pagan path?<br />This movie will cause you to face these concepts, while entertaining you in the process. Ignore the quibbles about which version this is.  It is a deeply provocative movie in any of its incarnations and worthy of your time.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is a mesmerizingly lavish rendition of the familiar love triangle set in Paris circa 1900. The cinematography is remarkable in its oddity, the costumes are glittering and glamorous and the music is a collection of twentieth century anthems presented together with a jarring but effective twist that is both rejuventating and nostalgic. The story itself is simple so as to not detract from the wonders that appear on the screen and in many places its advisable to let the story take a backseat and allow yourself to carried through the dizzying array of colours and sights. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both exhibit vocal skills that seem to erupt with emotion and conviction and effectivately remind many of us why we love musicals. It's possibly the oddest movie made this year - odd but refreshingly so.
B000051VWW|5.0|Lovely and relaxing from the from its opening through its close.  Each track laced with the purity of emotion we come to expect from Sade.  This album proved itself well worth the wait.<br />At first, I did not like the first track (her first release off the album) but with her second release I found myself unable to live without the disc.  Once I received it, I found it a smooth yet not static album.  Each track has its own distinctive flavor: &quot;By Your Side&quot; rich with instrumentation and innocence, &quot;Flow&quot; filled with a darker rhythm and more sensual qualities, &quot;King of Sorrows&quot; a beautiful gem of a track as only Sade could render, &quot;Somebody's Already Broke My Heart&quot; echoing this sorrow, while on the other hand, &quot;Slave Song&quot; picks up the pace with a stronger beat, yet a disturbing message, &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot; serves as one of the purest marryings of poetry and music ever found, the CD picks up a new energy with &quot;Every Word&quot; which incorporates not only the refined Sade sound but strong Carribean influences as does the up-beat and happy title track, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;(and I say happy because many of Sade's songs simply are not).<br />Overall, this CD is a welcomed part of my CD collection.  I discover some new detail or nuance every time I listen.  Some of Sade's best work.
B000002VC3|5.0|Yes, this is my favorite CD in my entire 200+ collection, and I can't say much more than what the other reviewers have said. &quot;Sirius&quot; is a nice, powerful, yet simple instrumental piece that fits well as a Chicago Bulls basketball intro, and it does a wonder introducing the popular &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;. My favorite piece on here is the instrumental &quot;Mammagamma&quot; for its quiet energy and mystical sound. It reminds me of seeing a horse galloping in the desert in the moonlight, put into music. &quot;Psychobabble&quot; is cynical yet humorous, and its tune is catchy. For those of you who like slower, mournful songs, listen to &quot;Old and Wise&quot;. It sounds almost like a death overture, but there's a sense of hope and optimism in the background. The other songs have generally the same sound as each other, more along the lines of &quot;Eye in the Sky,&quot; and the lyrics are powerful and quite quotable. If you like the easier tunes of Pink Floyd or are an avid fan of Supertramp, you will probably love this CD.

B00000BKDX|5.0|This is simply put the best cd of all time.  There is one tract that I simply must point out: Rime Of The Ancient Mariner.

0399230033|5.0|I don't quite know what my daughter (age 2 years) saw in this book, but it was her favorite for about 2 months. She wanted it read several times a night, and even slept with it. Perhaps it's the fact that the illustrations tell the story -- the few words are superfluous. She loved it so much I bought her plush toys for each of the animals. Well, actually, not the armadillo or hyena ... come to think of it, the book would probably be slightly improved by leaving out the armadillo and hyena.
0064430227|5.0|How can you not love the simplicity and the imagination of a story about a kid who draws his own reality?<br />This book makes a great bedtime read for kids, since it has easy to absorb illustrations, and a simple story.  And of course, a happy ending.<br />You're depriving your children if you don't have this on their bookshelf!
B0000029DD|5.0|I saw a video about two or three years ago and I didn't get the name.  I never had another run-in with that artist until very recently this year.  I was sitting in my kitchen when I heard that lovely voice on TV (and NO, I never forgot it).  It was a biography on JEFF BUCKLEY.  At last, I had found the singer I was looking for.  Two years after first hearing his music, I knew who I was actually hearing.  I instantly downloaded every song I could so I could find the one that touched me so long ago, but before I could find it, I was caught up in something.<BR>      I spent countless hours obsessing over every song I heard of his.  I first downloaded &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; and tried to immitate Jeff, but to no avail.  Then I heard &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; a Leonard Cohen cover, and I was swept off my feet by the life he put into that song.  When I finally stumbled upon that melody I heard on TV years before, I knew who my favorite ever musician was.  &quot;So Real&quot; brought back a feeling I had tried to get back for so long.  Before long, I had downloaded every song Jeff had ever written.  But I bought his album &quot;Grace&quot; anyway.  I, a lover of rock, jazz, and classical, bought a seven-year-old album that contained everything I ever dreamed of in a collection of ten songs.<BR>      I showed it to my band members and for days we talked of how great it would be if Jeff was our lead singer.  After listening to his music, all currently popular music looks silly.  And that's sad.<BR>      What's even more depressing is that the world has no more Buckley material to look forward to.  I was shocked at the fact that Jeff played in a coffee shop in my hometown five months before he died in a drowning accident in 1997.  And I missed it.  I'll admit, I'm in my late teenage years, and I cried.  This death was truly a waste.<BR>      That's why I hold this album and all of Jeff's music dear to me.  It's the only thing that has touched me.  As a songwriter, I have beeninspired by this like nothing else.  If you don't own this album, you're missing some of the most heavenly harmonies that this world has to offer.  Words cannot describe it.  Buy it now.
6305511055|5.0|Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford combine their talents for this impressive suspense film.  Robert Redford plays a reader for the CIA and gets lucky one day.  He then has to piece together a rather complicated puzzle.  This movie unravels its secrets slowly and surely, leaving the audience stuck within it's web.  Other movies nowadays like to spring it all on quick and thick, not so with this film.  It piles twist upon twist, and the plot doesn't seem contrived or pre-destined to get to the big revelation, common in most suspense films.  It flows wonderously and smoothly.  The characters are believable and real, not caricatures or superhuman action heroes.  It remains a favorite of mine after watching it years ago, and that is a testament to its staying power.  A truly impressive film.
0385484518|3.0|I'm sure words such as touching, poignant, etc., have been used to describe this book, and in many ways it was.  However, here is a man who continues to be upbeat, cheerful, maintain a positive attitude towards life and people, and spout many little philosophical tidbits all while his health is deteriorating rapidly day by day because of Lou Gehrig's disease.  Personally, I have a hard time grasping how somebody can maintain such a positive attitude in the face of a debilitating illness such as this, but I'm glad I read the book.  This story has the ability to teach people some valuable lessons if they are willing to learn them.
B00004Z459|2.0|Now I got no hard feelings for Linkin Park or anything since they did manage to get themselves in the music industry which requires a fair amount of hard work.  <br />It's pretty interesting how a band that changes their name to sound almost like Limp Bizkit all of a sudden become really popular because of it.  Have people forgotten what music really is?  I didn't know that music was a beauty contest to see who's got the cutest guys in a band and who's got the coolest names and such and such.  It's like 'Nsync's new song 'Pop'.  The song isn't really good yet it goes straight to number 1 on trl simply because the fans think the guys are cute.  This is how music is rated??<br />This CD gets a rating of two from me simply because it's got a few good songs (which happen to only be the singles).  The rest are simply too mediocre, unoriginal, or uninspiring unless you're a big MTV fan.  It is a fairly short album (37 minutes long).  But even though it's short, you do get pretty bored with it quickly.  The first few songs start off good, but then you end up realizing the following songs hauntingly sound similar to the first few.  <br />I'm sorry, but this is in no way a rock or heavy metal album.  Most hardcore rap fans who listen to this genre of music will argue that it isn't rap either.  It's more of a pop metal that was meant to attract trl fans into liking metal.  Sure, I guess it does work but these people aren't getting the full meat of heavy metal and rock.  A lot of the latest nu-metal clones have proven that the genre will in fact die soon because many of them have really done some terrible music.  <br />It's funny how Linkin Park is trying to copy the grooves and styles of bands such as Limp Bizkit while Limp Bizkit tried to take after KoRn.  KoRn was one of the founding fathers of this genre, since then, these clones have given a bad impression of genre.  What's also bad is that many of the fans are very unnappreciative of the original nu-metal bands that helped shape the existence of bands like Linkin Park.<br />I'm not saying Linkin Park and the Hybrid Theory is a bad group or album.  But think about what i've said and think about if it's really worth buying this album.  If you like their style of music and all, then by all means...buy the album.  But if you're only interested in it because of the hit singles or because your friends like it...you might be happier looking elsewhere.  :)
B000059T1V|5.0|This is one of blue's seminal albums -- a must-have for any blues fan. Simply put, it defined the Chicago style. Muddy's vocals are sensational -- he's in top form here -- and the band steams along like a locomotive. Don't expect high-quality sound, though. This 41-year old gem was recorded live and the sound gets pretty thin at times. No matter. It's the historic performance that you get.
B000053VAF|5.0|I suppose I shouldn't let my long time fan boy like admiration of Kevin Smith get in the way of my judgment for this movie, but I just can't help myself.  When I first went to see this flick in theaters I had to walk through a crowd of very angry religi' just to get to the box office.  I suppose my showing them my ticket didn't help the situation, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.<BR><br /> Anyway, about the film.  You could say that it did lack the drama that gripped me with Chasing Amy, and it most certainly had less comedy than Clerks.  With Mallrats, well, we'll just forget that ever happened (Even though I freaking love that movie).  However this movie I thought, was deeply insightful and funny enough to stand on its own.  Ben Affleck and Matty Damon are wonderful, Linda Fiorintino is mediocre, Chris Rock is hysterical, Alan Rickman is magnificent, and Salma Hyeck is enchanting.  Lest we forget Chasing Amy's Jason Lee.  Who is by his own right witty and entertaining to watch.  <BR><br />But what makes this film stand apart from Mr. Smith's other films, is the abbundent use of Jay and Silent Bob. (Please keep in mind this movie came out before Jay and Silent Strike Back, if you've ever seen his other movies you'll notice a significent lack of the characters thereof.)<BR><br /> The best part of this DVD is the commentary of course.  Listening to the creators and portrayers of this epic speak their mind on the likes of acting, casting, and each other is entertainment in itself.  I particularly like the part when they start asking each other what they'll be doing later that night in which they all reply watching TV.  X-Files, Simpsons, and what have you.<BR><br /> So I encourage those of you who have never heard, seen, or believed that Kevin Smith even existed to watch this movie.  It's kemp, witty, urbane, and just plain fun.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Acoustic Muddy, one step removed from the Delta and backed by outstanding musicians. Most notably Buddy Guy on acoustic guitar. Wonderful stuff. Muddy's gut-wrenching vocals run the gamut from sweet-as-honey to scorned and shaken. Make this a must for your collection -- blues or otherwise.
0061053147|3.0|I approached this book as someone who has always loved watching the hypnotic, gorgeous &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; but who has never considered it a particularly good movie, and who was curious about how this undeniably influential film was made and was marred. That curiosity was more than satisfied. Sammon seems aware of every question ever asked about &quot;BR,&quot; as he constantly and cozily calls it, and he does answer those questions--sometimes four or five times in the course of this 435-page book.<br />The writing is awful--coy, fawning, and inexpressive. (One minor example: Actor Rutger Hauer is described as &quot;warm but genuine&quot; on the occasion that the author interviews him. Does warmth imply lack of genuineness?) Sammon is also so far inside his own fandom that he is unable to deal with the film or its makers objectively. He goes so far as to say that the critics didn't like the film because it was too good for them. (His actual words: &quot;. . .as if many of the nation's critics had somehow been personally offended by the subtlety and care that had gone into this picture.&quot;) That's the sort of thing that a teenager would say: &quot;You don't understand me [my favorite movie] because you're just not as sensitive as I am.&quot;<br />This is not a critical examination of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; or a study of its influence on the cyberpunk genre. It is more like a straight narrative &quot;making of&quot; book (the sort that is usually one quarter its length), with the viewpoint that mostly everyone now agrees that it is a great film, so let's see how it got that way. With that point of view acknowledged, if the thing is to be done at all, one might as well go all the way, with all the detail that has been assembled here, and I did find a lot of it quite interesting. The organization is okay, although it could be better. The book could definitely use an index.<br />One of the most interesting aspects of the book is that it appears, from the comments gathered by Sammon, that it was as much a Rorschach test for the people who made it as it was for critics and audiences afterward: everyone has different explanations for what went into the movie and what things were meant to &quot;mean.&quot; Some would argue this is evidence that the film lacked a coherent vision; others that a shambles (such as &quot;Casablanca&quot;) can add up to a great movie. At any rate, Pauline Kael was right: whatever you think of &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; it definitely has its place in movie history.
B000002TQV|5.0|Read all the other reviews, they are absolutely correct. This is simply an amazingly good album, one which manages to be classic rock without having the &quot;rock&quot; take center stage. Radiohead, whatever their incarnation, is always intensely emotional and intensely personal. Every single Radiohead album, with the exception of Kid A and Amnesiac, which should really be considered one work on two discs, is completely unique. And The Bends is no exception. It stands on its own, and is, as an album, one of the best I have ever encountered.
B00005LB50|5.0|For those of you complainig about the obvious I say &quot;SO WHAT?&quot; I love this box set, even with all of it's flaws. The whole point of buying CD's for most people is to listen to it. I haven't stopped listening to this one since I bought it over a month ago. For those of you looking for perfection, I say &quot;Stop listening to Rock n Roll&quot;, because Rock n Roll is not perfect. That's what makes it brilliant.
0553583182|4.0|I suggest that you read the original, unrevised book.  That book is so powerful, it is unnecessary for any revisions to have been made.  I have read both, and the original is better because it is all in Dr. Murphy's words.  It is somewhat silly to assume that present day readers can not appreciate a book written in the 50's and that they need to have the gender of the subjects of the case studies changed from predominantly male to 50% female, in order to appreciate the information presented.  Other changes were to the professions of the subjects in the case studies and the technology which was discussed. It's just silly that someone felt these changes had to be made.  In any case, if that's what you need in order to be comfortable with reading the book, then by all means get it.  It's better that you read the &quot;updated&quot; version than not reading it at all, because it is a wonderful book and will teach you to understand that you are the most powerful and creative force in your life, and that you quite literally can have everything that you need to live a happy life, without struggling.  I use the information I learned from Dr. Murphy all day, every day.  I read the book a year ago, and I am beginning to make big changes in my life, economically, physically, mentally and spiritually.  I don't have everything I desire, and my life is not easy, but I am healthier and happier and more hopeful than I have ever been.  I have no reason to believe this trend will not continue.
B00005OWEG|5.0|I just saw Redux and I must say that it is, by far, one of the most well-directed, well-acted, films that I've ever seen. Though I would have to agree with the previous viewer that many of the extra scenes, especially the French Plantation scene, didn't seem to blend in well with the rest of the film's pace, the film is still very impressive. The one new scene, where the Playboy bunnies are forced into prostitution for helecoptor fuel, is absolutely essential to the movie. It further illustrates just how horrible the conditions were during Vietnam. Anyway, just SEE THIS MOVIE! Try to see it on the big-screen too, before it's too late!
B00005Q4GA|5.0|a great movie .one of those i want to watch over and over. i love movies that have strong female charecters , and lora is the queen of strong charecters .i strongley requomend this movie .
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This film is one of those that keeps you guessing until the end; and one that provokes discussion after you finish watching it.  A must for mystery affecionadoes.
B000002MTR|5.0|OK, Ill admitt I am a HUGE RHCP fan.  Here, we ALMOST have a masterpiece here.  My only dissapointments are the lyric content and some of the musical set-ups such as the kid background vocals on &quot;Aeroplane&quot;.  Anthony didnt realy do a good job in the means of lyrics in places, we know he can do better.  Dave is a guitar virtuoso hero! all musicial oriented people know it! Here he does things that John &lt;not putting the man down, hell he is doing equal to what Hillel (may the man Rest In Peace)did&gt; never thought about; Drop-D tuning amongst other tuning patterns.  Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary is his God-Like best, as always. Overall, this was an album for them to all come clean, it will take a few listens to get &quot;into&quot; it, but it is well worth it.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India Arie speaks from the heart of all woman. Video is a message that was needed to be told. Her words are true poetry.
B000001FT2|5.0|&quot;I have seen this face before&quot; is the most atmospheric and enticing song I have ever heard. I always have the &quot;repeat&quot; function active when its on my CD player (much to the chagrin of my neighbours, I suspect)
B00005NW02|5.0|If you liked System's debut album than you are gonna love this one! I can't stop listening to Toxicity. This album has exceeded all standards. System of a Down as a band has matured and enhanced their musical skills in the last two years. Serj's vocal ranges are so dynamic and the drumming is fantastic! Like what Daron said &quot;There are no filler songs&quot; and it is evident. This album features some tasty guitar licks with groovy bass lines. If you are looking for an album to purchase that will not let you down, it is Toxicity by far. Long live System of a Down!
B000003CUJ|5.0|The &quot;ring&quot; With Words is a &quot;must&quot; for those who enjoy Wagner, and who relish in the themes of his Ring Cycle. This CD brings the themes of the Ring Cycle together in one peice, without the blaring of the individual pieces usually heard on various CDs or at symphony orchestra presentations.
B00003CX59|4.0|To say simply: Great Film. The atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous. It has the quality of a dream. Or, to some, a nightmare. <BR>The film is filled with spurts of blood and gore and of course, headless corpses. But if you're a Tim Burton fan like I am and are familiar to Tim Burton's creative style, you won't be too surprised. Like Beetlejuice and Nightmare Before Christmas, the gore and horror are basically just a little bit of Tim's twisted humour, only this time it's a bit more graphic and yes, a little bit more vomit-inducing.<BR>With a cast that includes Johnny Depp (Tim's trusted friend whom he's worked with in his other films such as Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood), Christina Ricci (who undoubtedly seems destined to play in a Tim Burton movie), Christopher Walken, and other well-known actors, this film is a hit and a half.<BR>The story is based on Washington Irving's story about the a headless horseman who goes around decapitating townspeople. A forensic scientist strangely named Ichabod Crane was sent from the criminal headquarters of the world (namely New York in the olden days) to investigate the murders. He insisted that &quot;ghouls and goblins&quot; do not quite exist in crimes and believed that the murderer was a man (or woman) of flesh and blood. And boy did he get a bloody little surprise.<BR>Despite the thoroughly gorgeous look of the movie, and the interestingly gory (and sometimes funny) moments in the film, the plot does run a little thin at times and get a tiny little bit boring. But this film is definitely worth seeing nonetheless. Don't call yourself a Tim Burton fan if you haven't seen this movie. <BR>Watch out for a cameo appearance of the guy who played Batman's Alfred (I can't remember his name).
B00005O3VC|5.0|We now have everything Python can supply on DVD. As well as being able to obtain all 4 series of the Flying Circus television show, in a wonderful collection box, you can also get all 4 films on seperate DVD produtions, with The Life Of Brian being packed with extras on the Criterion Edition. And Now For Something Completly Different and The Meaning Of Life, offer little in the way of special features, but with the re-release of Holy Grail with more extras such than the first productuion, we should be able to forgive them for this.<BR>And by the looks of it - things don't stop there. There seems to be A Monty Python Live DVD that will be available at the end of next month, which will also include the 1st of the two German specials that were made in the early seventies. The second of which is already available on the Life Of Python double DVD.<BR>Once again, this proves how much better produced the DVD's are in the USA than in Britain. Even though these shows were all made over here and had British actors starring them, no effort goes into the DVD's at all.<BR>If you cannot purchase the Python collection of DVD's from America, all you get is a selection of the best sketches from Series 1 of Flying Circus with no extras, and a rather poor production of The Meaning Of Life - again with no special features. <BR>Even Fawlty Towers, isn't available on DVD over here, and that was, again one of the comedies to come out of the UK.<BR>Going back to this DVD, it's good to see that there is more thought gone into producing this one, as the first release was lacking in extras. The Film itself is a classic, second only to Life Of Brian as the worlds best comedy film.<BR>Standout moments - The Black Knight sequence, Brave Sir Robin's Song, and my personal favourite, Sir Lancelot being frisked up against the Police Car!!<BR>....
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I haven't seen a movie written this well for quite some time.  purchased this film without having seen it in the theaters or renting it.  It has turned out to be one of the best dvd's in my collection.  The film is shown in a backwards manner.  Meaning that the film progresses after the fact.  The beginning of this movie is actually the end of every other movie out there.  But this works for this film...because like us, the audience, the main character, Leonard, has no idea what occured just before the scene that we are watching.  It is a quirky, yet very original way a filming and creating a picture.  I believe that if the film was shown sequentially, it wouldn't have been the same picture.  I loved it.  <BR>The film is about a guy named leonard that has a sort of amnesia, except that he hasn't lost all past memories, he is unable to retain short term memories.  He forgets everything that happens 10 minutes after the fact.  No matter how hard he tries.  Anyways, leonard is trying to find the man who killed his wife...and in order to do this he must remember all of the facts that he has gathered in the past.  Sounds easier that done.<BR>Awesome move.  Highly recomended.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This 2000 release from Iron Maiden proves that classical metal is still alive and well. Back in the fray are Bruce Dickinson on lead vocals (where he should be) and Adrian Smith on guitars (ditto). A little more progressive than Maiden's earlier efforts, to me that merely signifies that they are keeping up with the times and evolving while not producing drivel merely to make money (unlike some band that has released crap ever since their black album. Oh and most of the bands on K-Rock too.). From the opening of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; to Nicko's &quot;Oh I f---in' missed it&quot; at the end of &quot;The Thin Line Between Love &amp; Hate&quot; there is no one song that you can say is really bad on this CD. &quot;The Mercenary&quot; and &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot; harken back to Powerslave and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son in songwriting, while &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; and the title track show us a glimpse of the aforementioned new, progressive Maiden. The only complaint I have with the album is the guitars, or lack thereof. What ever happend to the crunching sound that they had on Piece of Mind and Powerslave? I defy anyone to tell me that the production on Brave New World is better than the job Martin Birch did on Powerslave. If what Janick said on the Maiden website is true, that they plug in with no effects and turn the amp up to 10, then someone please donate a distortion pedal to these guys. But, I guess after what we had to listen to during the Blaze era (which I personally think wasn't so bad, but it looks like I'm in the minority) to have Bruce and Adrian back in the band and churning out some quality music, I can live with that. Highly recommended, if only to wash away the aftertaste of X Factor and Virtual XI.
B00004SZWB|5.0|This is a tight record. \\"All I Do\\" is too smooth. \\"Rocket Love\\" is mesmerizing and lilting, the strings make this song. \\"Cash in Your Face\\" is a sociopolitical synthesizing groove. You cant dance to it, you just feel it, what a statement! My favorite is \\"As If You Read My Mind\\". The rhythm and vibe of this song is exotic and exhillarating. Play this one! I slept on this record for too long.
0838577016|5.0|Now a day, with a fast development of sciences you may feel a hesitation before buying a new book, due to hard to find a book containing both classical and modern concepts. However, you are lucky in case you are interested in brain science, the field you can find &quot;principles of neural science&quot;. With one book, you may find most knowledge of not only neural science but related ones, which was discovered for decades up to now. This book is valuable for both novice and experienced researchers in life study.<br />Setting light on buy itself, the book is worthy to be praised &quot;a twinkle one like stars&quot;.
B00005IC2H|1.0|Did they just unwrap their electronic instruments? Did they ask the meter reader to sit in on percussion?<br />One can for a few minutes drift along the  melancholy into the mist, rust and maudlin, ghostly moors. But when you come to you will realize it is just not good.
B000003EUL|5.0|I agree totally with everyone else that this is one of those miracles in recordings. It leaves a perfect feeling at the end of what Germans call &quot;Gemutlichkeit&quot; a word with no English equivalent. The feeling of fulfillment, of contentment that comes from having participated in something perfect. The cello obligato at the start of the third movement is peerless. The dialogue with the piano throughout the movement is just spellbinding. There is nothing left to say.
B00000JMQE|5.0|I remember renting this one over and over again until a few years afterwards I couldn't remember the title of it anymore and it disapeared from the shelves. I think they could have done a better job with Dorothy being a bit older than what Judy Garland was in the first, but its neat to see the cast from a different light it kind of makes it fresh again, more like the storybook than hollywood. Get this one, Save it, Cherish it.
B00004S6GL|3.0|There is some great material on here. There is also some of Elliott's worst. &quot;Junk Bond Trader&quot;, songs 6 thru 9, plus a few others suffer from a horrendous case of over production. Junk Bond Trader in particular bothers me because it would be a great song were it not for the CHEESY bells that keep ringing. I saw him play this live and it was a fantastic song, blew me away in fact without the terrible production. &quot;Honky Bach&quot; may be among the worst songs I have ever heard, period. &quot;Pretty Mary K&quot; is up there among the worst too.<br />The production does work on some of the songs such as the psychadelic &quot;Everything Means Nothing To Me&quot; and &quot;Color Bars&quot;. On others such as &quot;Son of Sam&quot; and &quot;Can't Make a Sound&quot; it is tollerable. <br />There is still some solid song-writing beneath the marred production but it is clearly not his best work to date (Either/Or is easily the best IMO). I have no doubt there is more brilliance to come from Elliott, I can only hope he loses Tom Rothrock on the next one.
B00005JIZA|5.0|I was at a concert recently and guess who was the opening act.  Well duh, it was John Mayer.  I bought his CD at the show.  He is absolutely amazing.  His CD is outstanding, and his live show was enthralling.  He was so involved with his music.  &quot;No Such Thing&quot; has potential to be a radio hit as does &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland.&quot;  The latter is one of the sweetest songs, and is reminiscent of Dave Matthew's Band's &quot;Crash.&quot;  Every song is awesome, and I would highly recomend this album to anyone.
B000000HTL|5.0|I agree absolutely that this is a gem of a record.  excellent songs, musicianship, and specially one of the best drum recordings i have ever heard.  The sound is very good and  guy evans execution is absolutely killer.  Also, Hammil's voice is monumental.<br />Highly recommended for  top level progressive rock seekers.
B000002V0Q|3.0|There is some good songs on this album but they don't really live up to the Megadeth standard.<BR>The sound is very good and the good songs lyrics are very deep.<BR>Buy it if you what to
0060977493|4.0|The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy's first novel, was quite the pleasant surprise. I found this book a bit slow at the beginning but was soon drawn into Estha and Rahel's world.<br />This is the story of twins, Estha and Rahel, and their mixed up, backward, slightly twisted family. We hear the story of the twins' childhood, why Estha finally stopped speaking, the joyous and horrific things that changed their lives forever; we also get glimpses of their later years when Estha still didn't speak and Rahel longed to ease his pain. The story also touches on the Marxist/Communist conflict through the lives of the characters. This is far from a mainly political story, but it does serve as a backdrop.<br />Arundhati Roy's language and writing are very unusual but charming. I found some of the metaphors in the book deserved underlining and committing to memory. I find it hard to explain her style, but the best way I could explain would be to say that her style is simple...like that of a child...but beautiful in its simplicity and candor. You really feel that you are living life through the eyes of the twins.<br />I almost put this book back on the shelf before I was 100 pages in, but I'm so glad I didn't. The story is gripping and touching and one to be remembered.
B00005BJC7|4.0|IMHO this sounds like Kid A outtakes.  Don't get me wrong, there is some great material here but it doesn't have the cohesiveness of Kid A.  Some of the songs are as good as, if not better than, the Kid A stuff.  Could do without Hunting Bears though, Neil Young did it better on the Dead Man soundtrack...sorry Johnny.  Not a big fan of Knives Out either (yawn)...the rest of the world seems to love it though so trust them, it must just be a personal thing.
B00003CXSP|1.0|I must agree with Robert B. Paul, of Bridgeport; newsguy202, of Falls Church; and rkfj, of Upper Darby, PA.<BR>It's too bad you can't rate a movie less than 1.  This movie is for the intellectual types that can understand the deeper meanings of thespian arts that were obviously overwhelming in movies like \\"Night of the living Dead\\"!<BR>I collect movies of all types, many of them strictly for the cast.  I have all but one of Anthony Hopkins movies, \\"Hannibal\\".<BR>I bought it on D.V.D. but gave it away after my first viewing.<BR>This movie was far below the talents of Hopkins.  I will think twice before purchasing another of his films. Certainly not without reading some of ... reviews.  I have never been sorry with Jodie, and am proud of her for turning this one down!<BR>This story is needlessly fragmented, although not hard to follow.<BR>The author of \\"Dick and Jane\\" could have written the script. Much of the violence of \\"Silence of the Lamps\\" was implied, as opposed to the extremely distracting visual effects of this film. You can't enjoy a film if your head is turn away through half of it. This movie should be mandatory for pre-med students to see if they have what it takes.<BR>I'm not sure what Ray Liota's character's governmental position was, (remember I only saw this film once), but he was a dufus.  God forbid we actually hire people like that to watch over us.
B0000067L2|5.0|Forged from technical expertise and personal animosity---remember Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce were at war with one another back then---Cream came screaming across the music scene of the late '60s as a powerhouse that demanded to be heard.<br /><br />\\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\" and \\"We're Going Wrong\\" are perhaps the best known tracks on a stellar album, though \\"World of Pain\\" and \\"Dance the Night Away\\" may best represent the prevailing vibe of the time.<br /><br />Though he did not write much of the material and what he did write tended to be eccentric, Ginger Baker clearly powered this trio with his amazing time signatures and ability to match Bruce or Clapton's inventiveness. Jack Bruce seemed to be in his element here: solid, clean bass lines and gutty vocals. Eric Clapton was on a mission back then, and his inspired work throughout this recording lives up to any hype.<br /><br />If you only buy one Cream recording (excluding the artifical anthologies and best of's), I think this is the one to have for it is more mature than \\"Fresh Cream\\" and largely lacks the excesses that marred parts of \\"Wheels of Fire.\\" The weaker tracks, such as Blue Condition, have not improved with age, however.
0441172717|5.0|I found this book to be extremely intriguing.  I had never bought science fiction and had never really cared for it.  Frank Herbert did an excellent job of entrancing me into his work.  This book is fast paced and keeps the readers attention well.  Once started on this awesome adventure, Herbert takes the reader through politics, scandal, betrayal, religion, addiction, love, revenge, and of course the desert.  The ending leaves you hanging and forces you to read the next one.  This book is well worth the read a couple of times.
B000007OY0|5.0|This movie is superb.  I loved it.  It has that sense of magic.  And this movie was based on the short story by STEPHEN KING!  Those of you who are scared by that, don't be.  This movie is not scary at all.  It is wonderful.
B00004XONN|5.0|I am kind of wondering if all of you who wish Radiohead would return to the OK Computer days missed out on those days yourself. You must have been off listening to something else: maybe Green Day or rap or something, something simpler, maybe you weren't old enough to buy music yet, who knows. I was there. I bought it on the day of its release. I witnessed the similar media hype for it. I saw them on that tour. I got my fill of OK Computer completely. My thirst for that music was quenched completely. After seeing Meeting People is Easy and hearing the Airbag EP as well as the B-Sides of some of their singles, I knew things would never be the same for Radiohead, you could already tell they were moving on but that was OK...I was excited to hear WHAT THEY WOULD DO NEXT, I was excited for them to move on. The first time I heard Kid A, I was listening to it with headphones on and it made me drool, it made me squirm, it shoved me into an existential freak-out! Fantastic! Radiohead has done it again! A completely new sound which builds upon the work of the albums that came before it. The Radiohead feeling and emotion are still there, just as powerful as ever! Sure it is more abstract, but it is there and I love it. I thought to myself, thank god(!) they did not put out OK Computer part 2. That truly would have been one of the biggest disappointments ever. Kid A is without a doubt my favorite Radiohead album to date, probably my favorite album by any artist to date. To all those who missed out on the OK Computer days and are calling on Radiohead to make a return, get over it and forget about it. No doubt they will move on to something new the next time around and I can't wait to hear it.
B000002TP7|4.0|&quot;Sabotage&quot; is a killer ... &quot;Sure Shot&quot; and &quot;Root Down&quot; are deep.  A lot of the rest of this plays like mildly amusing filler, but the highlights take the Besties further than before and make this worth having.
B000002J27|5.0|This album was, as all good Genesis fans know, the first album produced after Peter Gabriel left the band during their tour to support &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;. Many in the press and in the general public had pretty much written Genesis off after Peter's departure. As strange as this may seem now, it was not so hard to believe at the time. During the band's previous career, Peter had affected a powerful stage presence due to his use of makeup, props, and costumes. It was widely believed at the time that Peter pretty much wrote everything and that Tony Banks, Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford, and Phil Collins were just his backup band. However, Genesis themselves knew different, and they set out to prove it in spectacular fashion. After Peter, the remaining members conducted a long, exhaustive, but ultimately fruitless search to find a lead vocalist before Phil Collins reluctantly stepped out from behind his drumset to assume singing duties. Ironically, he had provided &quot;secondary&quot; vocals for the band for quite a while, most notably on &quot;Colony of Slippermen&quot; on the Lamb album, as well as lead vocals on a couple of tracks from &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot;. However, it was not until this album that Genesis and the world would realize that Phil Collins was a first-class singer, in addition to being a drumming powerhouse. The album starts off very strongly with &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot;, which is still one of my all-time favorite Genesis tracks, largely on the strength of Steve Hackett's excellent guitar. Next up is the haunting &quot;Entangled&quot;, a otherworldly, yet hilarious piece concerning the medical profession and the high cost thereof. &quot;Squonk&quot; follows, a poppy song about a mythological woodland creature that, to me, foreshadows the Genesis of the 80's. In fact, I feel that this track, as well as the fast-paced and funny &quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery&quot;, would fit right in on the &quot;Genesis&quot; and &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; albums of the mid-80s. &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot; - Tony Banks' compositional skills at his finest! &quot;Ripples&quot; - A bittersweet saga about aging and the loss of youth. &quot;Trick of the Tail&quot; - Another Genesis classic about culture shock and alienation, as well as the longing everyone feels sometime to return home, where everyone understands you and no one sees you as different or inferior. No one makes music like this anymore, folks. The album wraps up with the instumental &quot;Los Endos&quot;, a fine instrumental that includes parts of the melodies from some of the other tracks on the album. When this album was released, it sold more copies than all other Genesis releases combined to that point. Legend even has it that this album was the favorite of Princess Diana. As some other reviewers have said, this may be the one Genesis album that everyone likes, both the Peter Gabriel fans and the Phil Collins fans. As for me, I think it's among Genesis' best efforts overall, although I am one of those rare people who actually like and can appreciate both &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; and &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;.<br />An interesting note here - this album and &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; are, I believe, the only Genesis albums where individual songwriting credit is given. It's interesting to see who wrote which songs and compare their musical styles. On this album, the lion's share of the compositional duties were shared by Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford. Phil Collins had not yet really come into his own as a writer, and Steve Hackett, by this point, was getting shoved more and more to the side. This had a big influence on his decision to leave Genesis in 1977, and it's too bad. His talents are showcased very well on this album. It makes one wonder what the Genesis hit machine would have produced in the 80's if he had stayed around.

B00003CX5P|4.0|For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Star Wars saga I'd like to welcome you to the planet Earth and ask if your stay on Mars was enjoyable.<br />Now with that aside, I'm sure this is a statment that will anger alot of fans out there; This movie is not that bad. It is rather enjoyable if you take it in the context of the series. It essentially lays the foundation for the entire Star Wars saga. Now with that said, I will freely admit that there are some problems with this film. First being that the Star Wars mythology is so vast and so expansive that the story does tend to get bogged down in detail (Unknown to the casual fan there is even a back story BEFORE the Phantom Menace detailing an era in the Star Wars timeline called the &quot;Sith War&quot;. The Sith War could have easily been scripted for another trilogy. That's is how enormous the scope of the Star Wars universe).<BR>There are some scenes that seem very extraneous that make me wonder what deleted scenes that will be included in the DVD version that actually did end up on the cutting room floor. All the basic elements of a Star Wars movie are here ( i.e. the lightsaber duels, epic scale battles, daring escape, etc.) but the pace of the movie tends to lag in the middle. One can't help but think if this is the result from the fact that George Lucas hasn't made a movie in over 16 years. Where a movie like X-Men seems to grab you and keep you riveted to your seat, Phantom Menace offers plenty of time for bathroom breaks without missing any relevant action. Hopefully in Episode II &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; ( can you believe that name?) the story will be tightened up considerably.<BR>Even with all that said the fact remains that this is still a Star Wars movie. Though it is probably the weakest film in the series it still is head and shoulders above anything else in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Being an anime fan it is not a stretch that the Star Wars universe could easily co-exist within the anime universe. It does after all borrow alot of story elements from many of todays popular anime series ( such themes as redemption and self discovery are popular in the anime genre). It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the Star Wars saga is in fact a live action anime story. And the Phantom Menace, though flawed as it may be, is still an excellent starting point to that story. It is well worth owning and well worth even purchasing a DVD player for.
0553573403|5.0|...George R R Martin deservesto be spoken off among so great writes as Tolkien, McKiernan, Donaldson and of course one of my other favorites... Robin Hobb.<br />This is intriguing, fascinating and absolutely wonderful, it has it all... danger, action, intrigues, magic, good guys that turn bad guys and bad guys that turn good guys and then of course heroes and heroines... and then it has wolves and strange characters and humor, not to forget.<br />Read it and Enjoy it greatly!!!!!
B000001EKX|4.0|Almost everything KISS released before DYNASTY is now considered to be a classic. This includes HOTTER THAN HELL, their second studio album. THe album is strong, contains silly lyrics all the way, but musically is really strong. Its no DRESSED TO KILL nor LOVE GUN, but it rocks.
B000002J1F|3.0|As a Yes fan of well over nine months (waits for laughter), I've quickly snagged up a fair amount of their albums.  However, I have no intention of buying Fragile. Ever.<br />While I agree that most of the &quot;real songs&quot; (i.e., with all five members playing) are well-played journeys into complexity, I see no reason to hear &quot;Cans and Brahms&quot;, &quot;5% For Nothing&quot;, &quot;We Have Heaven&quot; or for that matter, &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;.  These three tracks are glaring earsores on what could have been a really groundbreaking album.  Instead, the drum, vocal and keyboard solo pieces serve nothing but to break up the cohesiveness of the album.<br />While it is certainly slightly off the usual beaten path, musically, this band has put out much better works before and after then.  Fragile doesn't really describe this album right.  I'd call it Fragmented. <br />You may groan now.
B00000DI06|5.0|This CD is a welcome mid-price CD coupling Rutter's two large-scale works, his &quot;Requiem&quot;, composed after his father's death, and the more recent &quot;Magnificat.&quot;<br />Rutter's &quot;Requiem&quot; clearly shows the influences of Gabriel Faur&eacute;'s Requiem, composed about a century earlier, while his &quot;Magnificat&quot; is, in some ways, based on Bach's &quot;Magnificat,&quot; especially in the interpolation of additional texts. Both are fairly straightforward pieces, well within the range of amateur choirs.<br />Both of the recordings feature clear singing from the choir, and subtle playing from the orchestra. My only complaint (a minor one at that) is that occasionally Rutter's forces seem a little too small in the first movement of the &quot;Requiem,&quot; but the rapturous cello solo in the second movement, &quot;Out of the Deep,&quot; more than makes up for this.<br />However, at mid-price, this CD is certainly a bargain; fans of the &quot;Requiem&quot; who are looking to acquire a copy certainly would not go wrong with this disc.
B00005M989|3.0|buy the 3 cd set if you want the best from prince.
B0000025YL|5.0|RESTLESS AND WILD is Accepts best offering. Period. Theres no question about that. BREAKER and BALLS TO THE WALL are also stunning pieces of music, but Restless is the one. But I just feel, from the bottom of my heart, that this band could have achieved so much more success and recognition had it another singer than this guy Udo Dirkscheneider.... The case is that the music is so good, so well crafted metal, that you become used to listen to this guys horrible voice.... Probably Udo has a very strong personality, one that enabled him to convince such talented musicians as Wolf Hoffmann, Peter Baltes, Hermann Frank Jr. and Stefan Kaufmann that his &quot;pain in the stomach&quot; voice was the best for the band !!!
B000002L71|4.0|The movie Stop Making Sense was an amazing chance to see one of the most creative bands of the 80's in action. This soundtrack does a good job of capturing the sound of this event, but does not quite reproduce the power of the show as well as the concert film. The band is in fine form and David Byrne's vocals are impassioned and forceful, very different from the sterility and control found on the studio recordings. A new version is available with added tracks. Fans probably should check that out as opposed to this version.
B00005NW02|5.0|After first hearing the single &quot;Chop Suey&quot; off of this CD I immediately had to run out and buy it. I took it home, sneaking the Parental Advisory Warning past my parents, put on my head phones and proceded to listen. Boy was I suprised! I love Rage Against the Machine, so the first song &quot;Prison Song&quot; really got me hooked, everything after that was &quot;like butta&quot;. All of the songs are great, and the African Soul Drum Jam at the end was icing on the cake. It sure beats the jock strap off of Barbra Streisand.
0871137380|5.0|Mark Bowden delivered an excellent novel destined to be a classic in the non-fiction community. The level of journalism and reasearch involved in writing this book must have been amazing, as was described in the back. Finally, an accurate account on modern war and a look at what a soldier truly is. A person who well trained, is still a human with a past, with a mother, and a life. Bowden shows that the American military in the modern world is capable of winning a battle and losing the war as it did in Vietnam. Bowden also delivers a phenomenal look at what it means to be an elite soldier, and the fear and bravery that flows through the veigns of those called to do America's worst.<BR>The book is an honest and detailed look at the Battle of the Black Sea, which erupted in Mogadishu, Somalia when the United States sent the elite Army Rangers, and almost mythical Delta Force to begin a campaign of bringing down Somali warlords tearing the fragile African nation apart.<BR>A must read for anybody who is, was, or plans to be apart of the greatest military in the world.
B00003ZKS1|5.0|As it happens with a lot of already known musicians that leave a famous band and starts a new solo career, often theirs first albuns are the best of their career. This is the case with this Michael Schenkers Group debut. THis album is the best released by Schenker, even if in the future he really released great albuns as BUIL TO DESTROY, etc. But this one from 1980 is fresh and authentic, creative, has great Simon Phillips on drums, moderately unknown singer Gary Barden giving his best. All in all, a perfect album from the first to the last second of rock !!!
B00003CX95|3.0|This may not have been Mel Gibson's first directorial effort, but it's certainly the most egotistical of his movies. Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace is so modest, in fact, that he allows his character to be not only the greatest warrior ever seen (able to ride his *horse* into a building, kill a man, and still get out alive despite the presence of a phalanx of armed guards), but so charismatic that the daughter of the enemy king falls in love with him after only one meeting.  He not only fights and romances, he also speaks several languages, and can dazzle lords and commoners alike with his intelligence. (&quot;En francais, s'il vou plait!&quot;) With a stirring speech sounding suspiciously like Kenneth Branagh in HENRY V, Wallace inspires his men to feats of derring-do, invents battle strategies never even conceived during that day and age (because they were tactically impossible, such as letting the enemy run right into a wall of spears), and leads his army into head-on crashes against the foe that bear more than a passing resemblance to the battle scene from Eisenstein's ALEXANDER NEVSKY.  And when Wallace finally meets his end, it's not enough to merely die a defiant, heroic death...instead, he becomes a Christ figure and has a full-blown crucifixion.  (The portrayal of the king's son as a flaming drag queen brought howls of protest from gay-rights groups, as homophobia is a running theme in a number of Gibson's movies.)<br />The movie is certainly not boring, and the battle scenes are good (if bloody); but it's merely an attempt to combine Errol Flynn's ROBIN HOOD with the typical Mel Gibson character, such as we see in MAD MAX or LETHAL WEAPON.  I'd lament the fact that this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 1995, but then the playing field that year was very poor and the Oscars are usually given to the most &quot;politically correct&quot; movies anyways.
B00000IMTE|4.0|First of all, I must need to meake a statement: every one of the four &quot;Rainbow with Dio&quot; albuns are much better than anything RAINBOW released after that, mainyl the horrible &quot;pop metal&quot; albuns of the Joe Lynn Turner days. Saying that, I must say that this one, their first release, is astonishingly great, its great merit being the fact that each song is very different from the other, withou following the same old path or formula, but at the same time without sounding indulgent. This album is just fantastic !!! By the way, Id like to congratulate all th reviewers below. THis album seems to have received an unproportional ammount of fantasticly written reviews, all of them are &quot;killers&quot; and well written !!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This is yet another example of Hollywood distorting history with a tedious love story. I am a Pearl Harbor junkie because the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on my fifth birthday. For this reason I will probably buy the video, but I don't recommend that anyone else do so. The actual bombing scenes are worth watching, but nothing else. A steaming pile of oduks (kudo spelled backwards) to all those who rated this turkey at four or five stars. The acting is mediocre and the plot is worse. Alec Baldwin once again shows that he can't act his way out of a paper bag.
B0000025CP|5.0|Stained Class and Hell Bent are near perfect examples of early metal, before it became \\"popular\\" to wave your fist and bang your head.  Its hard to say one is better than the other but I personally prefer Stained Class and believe it contains the best JP song ever; White Heat, Red Hot.  The 2 powerfull guitars of Downing and Tipton sound more like 20 and never get too loud.  Listen to the entire album at high volumes because lower volumes don't do it justice.  Make sure you are alone (preferably in your car) so you can freely jam out without making a complete fool of yourself.

B00005JK93|4.0|Say, what!! An angry inch indeed. This movie will become a cult flick along with 'Rocky Horror' and a few others. Cameron was devastating as Hedwig, and the rest of the crew were great. Really liked the songs, but couldn't quite get all the words. As it took my concentration away from the screen. <BR>Parts of the jerking gyrations in some of the stage numbers reminded me of some  fast-moving-numbers in Moulin Rouge. I will have to rent it and or buy it to really be able to get those words right. As it was;<BR> I was the only one in the theater who was laughing out loud. Or maybe I couldnt hear the others above my own...the colors were vivid and if u can see it in an auditorium type theater and sit up in the back..to be able to take it all in. I gave this a ****star rating.<BR>ciao:yaaah69
B00003CX5P|2.0|episodes 4-6 are in fact some of  the most outstanding movies I have ever seen....but this one, is just [bad], i really didnt like it at all, I can't  believe I saw it in the theatre. The only cool guy Darth Maul has like two lines, but on the plus side the computer animation is top notch, other than that you'd have to be an ultimate star wars nut to like this.
B00001W0FD|5.0|Ethereal,haunting,creepy,depressing,otherworldly,euphoric,nightmarish,brilliant.These are only some words I can describe Carnival of Souls(maybe my favourite movie ever)with.Okay here is what to expect plotwise.A girl gets a ride with some other girls they challenge some guys to a drag race.Apparently these girls really are not racecar driving material because they go off into a body of water and only the girl they picked up survives crawling out from the water.The world is just not the same to this poor young lady after this.She sees the image of a cadaverous spectre in all sorts of strange places and the world seems to be slipping away from her.Now why I love this movie so much.Well for one I think I am a pretty odd and morbid person because no this movie could never be a blockbuster because it is not for all tastes.This movie truly gives you a feeling of death and the presence of the supernatural in ways no other film has.Yes the budget to this movie is low but no movie no matter how high the budget has been able to seemingly give you the feeling of being in the strange world of the dead that lies just behind the curtains of this comfortable world.It goes to show that being able to put lots of money into a movie has nothing to do with how good it is.True artists do not need million dollar budgets to create a great work of art.This Herk Harvey who I do not know much about is truly a great artist.I think he only directed one more movie after this one but I am not sure the title of it.It is sad though he had a gift for the surreal and gloomy.Now if you enjoy only what is normal and comfortable in film go and see whatever is big at the box office when you read this but if you are tired of modern society and its trappings you will love this movie!You can experience something truly incredible.If Poe was still living I think he would love this movie.Its as important to horror as many of his literary works I think.They have had good horror movies and they have had bad ones but they have never had one like this since.
1878424319|2.0|Voters take your mark (mouse), set, object.  Warning, I'm afraid I sense uncontrollable episodes of spasmodic mixed metaphors to follow.  Without lapsing into a discussion of the morality of conquest and colonialism, if the Aztecs truly adhered to this philosophy it's a wonder Hernan Cortes met with any resistance whatsoever in Mexico.  Now I remember why I avoid the self-help section like leprae bacillus was imbedded in the cover of each volume.  In order to spare others exposure to the contagion, here are the four agreements:<br /><br />1) Be impeccable with your word;<br />2) Don't take anything personally;<br />3) Don't make assumptions;<br />4) Always do your best.<br /><br />How might any rational being question with the validity of these rather benign objectives? I would surmise most have heard them in some form or fashion from wiser elder mentors since the beginnings of time. Yet, as elucidated by Don Miguel Ruiz, the simplistic text has more un-detonated land mines than an eastern European war zone. In essence, Toltec wisdom, which is fundamentally identical to Yaqui wisdom as expounded by Don Juan Matus in the Castaneda series, has threads of commonality with most spiritually based belief systems known to man, dating back to homo.Erectus. In this easy-to-read little volume, Don Miguel offers clear analogies to Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and at one point appears to veer off into a flight of pantheistic fancy. New Age might be inclusive, but this is way over the top.<br /><br />The internal contradictions I noticed here reside with the Castaneda books as well. It took years to recognize them in those books when I was too consumed with becoming a sorcerer or warrior of the Yaqui tradition to notice. I may have been young or naïve; young and naïve; or young, naïve and unwilling to acknowledge the complexities of human interaction. In this case the inconsistencies are easier to recognize without the metaphor, allegory and mysticism (or peyote) that permeates Castaneda's works.<br /><br /> Don Miguel's calm and controlled pedagogy is solipsism. He explains how each of us has undergone a process of domestication, where the inculcated lessons result in value and belief systems that preclude independent thought and autonomy. We construct a set of negative agreements we employ to arrive at negative self-assessments, self-abnegation and self-victimization. If man sprang as a physically mature being from the head of some entity like Athena from Zeus, Ruiz's objections might make sense, as it is we do have to learn how to become productive members of a culture or society.  Toltec wisdom infers aversion to acceptance of responsibility and accountability for one's actions; a narcissistic outlook where any proscribed behavior may be excused as the attempt to do one's best, as is clearly evident in the following excerpt from the book:<br /><br />\\"The first three agreements will only work if you do your best.  Don't expect that you will always be able to be impeccable with your word.  Your routine habits are too strong and firmly rooted in your mind.  But you can do your best. Don't expect that you will never take anything personally; just do your best. Don't expect that you will never make another assumption, but you can certainly do your best.\\"<br /><br />Two-thirds of the book is devoted to clarification and expansion of each of the four agreements, with contradiction and repetitious passages leading the way. The final third is devoted to explanation of the techniques to elimination of our existing personal agreements, implementation of the three phases to mastery of Toltec philosophy (awareness, transformation, intent), and how to arrive at a new dream of the world.  He concludes with a couple of prayers for freedom and love.<br /><br />The wisdom here is sacrosanct. Write down the agreements and attempt to incorporate them into your daily routine if you wish. But, you don't need this book as a guideline.ates Castaneda's works.<br /><br /> Don Miguel's calm and controlled pedagogy is solipsism.

B00000I01A|4.0|The soundtrack is pretty good. However, I was dissapointed that the music wasn't exactly as the film (but close). The sprinting and running scene up the mountain sounded better on the movie - the tempo was more quicker. It is still good to listen when you work out.
B000000ORE|5.0|This is one of the best hard rock albums and the best Tesla record. All of the songs are great, not only because of Keith's voice, but also because of the guitar and piano works. You can feel the force in Hang Tough and Heaven's Trail, and the peace in Love Song. A strong recommended album.
0385486804|3.0|This tale of &quot;Alex&quot; who started by driving, then hitchhiking and finally walking into the Alaskan wilderness has a tragic end.  Jon Krakauer dragged up all kinds of information about the recent graduate's tracks, interviewing those that Alex had befriended on his travels.<br />The story is somewhat disjointed - in part because Alex did not take the straight route to Alaska - and also because there's not that much to tell so the story is interwoven with Krakauer's own and other insights into venturing off on one's own.<br />The story is an easy read and well written, conveying a sense of adventure. Alex may have been criticized for being unprepared - which he was - but at least he took the time to explore his country.<br />Those contemplating escaping from the real world into the wilderness  will find a cautionary tale and useful ideas. It will also appeal to parents of hitchhikers and to armchair travelers who want to learn what its like to be a bum.
B00003CXPD|4.0|Billy Elliot is growing up in a mostly all-male home, his elderly grandmother lives there, but his mother passed away when he was younger.  This testosterone dominated house only understands mining, union workers, and boxing.  So, Billy fears telling his Dad and older brother of his secrect passion... dancing. The small-town realness of the characters and believablity of the perfomances helps the audience identify with the Billy's plight. Especially notalble, are Billy's father played by Gary Lewis, who is the fulcrum on which the story pivots and Julie Walters, the dance instuctor who encourages Billy to pursue his love.  <br />The shred use of a hugely varied soundtrack drives the heart of the film, but one does not have to like music and dancing to identify with Billy Elliot and his plight.  It strkes a chord with anyone who has ever feared being different and afraid to pursue their dreams. Small note: Understanding of the thick Irish accent is increased greatly with use of closed-captioning.  Rating: 4 ½ out of 5 stars.
B000000OSO|2.0|Actually, 2 and-a-half stars...<br />\\"Get A Grip\\" was Aerosmith's follow-up to their multi-platinum \\"Pump,\\" and the band's first album of the 90's. Coming up with a worthy successor to a stellar collection like \\"Pump\\" would prove difficult for any band, even veterans like Aerosmith. There were pre-release rumors that Geffen was unhappy with early versions of \\"Get A Grip.\\" True or not, the final version of the album is neither a disaster nor a masterpiece. An assortment of outside talent was recruited to contribute to the album. Yet despite (or perhaps, because of) the input of co-writers like Lenny Kravitz, Jim Vallance, Desmond Child, Tommy Shaw, and Jack Blades, \\"Get A Grip\\" never rises much above mid-line Aerosmith. <br />     At 13 songs and over an hour long, there's more filler than killer on \\"Get A Grip.\\" The filler isn't awful - but there's a sense of \\"been there, done that\\" pervading much of the record. With over three years between \\"Pump\\" and \\"Get A Grip,\\" things could have sounded a bit fresher.<BR>     <BR>     In retrospect, the album served as a bellwether for Aerosmith's future musical direction. The Boston Bad Boys served up a fairly balanced mix of hard-rock boogie-woogie and power-ballad nirvana. Songs like &quot;Fever,&quot; &quot;Livin' On The Edge&quot; and the furious &quot;Eat The Rich&quot; demonstrated that Aerosmith could still rock in a hard place. But - as was the case for many rockers at the time - the CD's ballads are what made the greatest impact on the charts. <br />     The best of the ballads, the mid-tempo &quot;Cryin,'&quot; is animated by a driving horn section. By comparison, \\"Amazing\\" and \\"Crazy\\" are better seen (in their accompanying videos - featuring Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler) than heard.<br />     All in all, there's enough on \\"Get A Grip\\" to keep fans of \\"Pump\\" or \\"Permanent Vacation\\" happy. Likewise, if you believe that the last great thing Aerosmith did was \\"Toys In The Attic,\\" \\"Get A Grip\\" will only reinforce your opinion.
B00000IB4D|4.0|This album is santana's fifth album and it is mostly a straightforward jazz album. This album tended to steer away from his previous Latin sound and focused a little more on Jazz. The title cut along with four others are all instrumental. This album is worth it for the track &quot;Flame-Sky&quot; in which Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin go head to head on guitar. The track takes you on a journey from beginning to end during it's 13 minute running time. I'm also very surprised that this album is so hard to get a hold of in the United States. From start to finish this album definitely makes you look at Santana in a slightly different light. Lyrically and musically.
B000021YQV|5.0|Only when I have this CD in my mouth, can I truly understand the unadulterated beauty that is \\"SYSTEM OF A DOWN\\". Saliva slowly engulfing every square inch as though my body is accepting it as yet another organ. I get goose pimples when I but think of my outstretched cheeks as if ceaselessly asking for more gritty goodness. This CD is almost as comforting in one's mouth as any digitally re-mastered work of the Velvet Fog himself.
B000005JA8|4.0|It's definitely not something you're going to like the first time you hear it. It sounds like someone took a whole bunch of music, threw it down the stairs and didn't quite put it back together the way they found it. As many others have said you definitely have to come back to it after you buy it. The more you listen to it the more you realize how amazing it really is. With band member names like The Mascara Snake and Drumbo you know right off the bat that it's definitely going to be interesting. The album cover is also bizarre. You've got a picture of the band on the back standing on a bridge. Captain Beefheart is holding a lamp that has no lampshade and he's pointing it at someone else who's down in the water. You need to see it to believe it. Just check it out and you'll see what the hype is all about. Also check out the material Captain Beefheart did with Frank Zappa for another mind trip. Another very fantastic Captain Beefheart album was the one after this one which is now out of print in this country. It is entitled &quot;Lick My Decals Off Baby&quot;. Some great tracks on Trout Mask Replica are &quot;Frownland&quot;, &quot;Neon Meate Dream Of A Octofish&quot;, Hair Pie Bakes I and II&quot; and &quot;Ella Guru&quot;.
6303314015|5.0|The Lion King may be the very best Disney film ever! The creative team and energy that went into the making of this film is phenominal! Sending a whole team of animators to Africa to study the bugs, plants, sand, rocks, trees, and other animals and how they move to make sure that this movie was as realistic as they could make it.  In Disney tradition having live animals on the set to draw. If you watch the way simba walks his movements are not cartoony but rather very real looking cat like movements.  <br />Not only the animation but the Music. Tim Rice and Elton John, all I can say is WOW!  Talk about great songs from Circle of Life to Can you feel the love tonight, which made great additions to the other hits that Elton John has in his career.  To the fun Can't Wait To Be King and who could forget Ernie Sabala and Nathan Lane in Hakuna Matata. And of course all of the backround music was superb! <br />The All-Star cast of course helps quite a bit too. Jonathon Taylor Thomas (from my favorite TV show ABC/Touchstone/Buena Vista show Home Improvement) provides the voice for young Simba, James Earl Jones provides the voice for Mufasa and what a great job he did as he actually sounds like a lion when he talks.  Nathan Lane as the smart talking meer cat Timon Ernie Sabala as Pumbaa who is a stinky warthog. Jeremy Irons provides the voice of scar who is the wicked uncle to Simba and Brother to Mufasa.  And of course Cheech Marin and Whoopi Gholdberg provide the hillarious antics of the Hyenas! Together what a team!<br />The story opens with the great song Circle Of Life as Mufasa and Sarabi have just given birth to Simba and the entire African Pridelands have come to witness the event. All of them except Scar of course, who was supposed to be next in line for the thrown but now Simba is prince and heir to the throne, thus jealousy lerks in Scars soul.  <br />Mufasa shows Simba the entire kingdom but orders him to never go the the shadowy place. However Simba being curious takes his friend Nala and they try to sneak down there and through the wonderful song of Can't wait to be king, they succeed in losing the Kings Domer Bird Zazu.  They find themselves in a dark and scary place however Simba acts brave until the Hyenas come out and begin chase after the cubs and Zazu who has caught up to the young cubs. <br />The following day Scar takes Simba down to the gorge and tells him that his father has a big surprise for him. But instead a stampede starts and Mufasa is forced to rush down to rescue Simba.  In the process Mufasa is killed by the rushing stampede and falling off of a cliff.  Scar makes Simba beleive it is his fault and to run away and never return.  Simba does what he is told, and Scar tells the lions that Mufasa and Simba were killed. <br />Simba finds himself alone in the desert where he runs into Timon and Pumbaa and learns that no matter what is in your past it doesn't matter to Hakuna Matata &quot;No Worries&quot; There he grows up and learns to live a different way than a prince. Until he runs into some old friends from the pridelands and realizes that he must go back and challenge scar for the throne.<br />A beautifully and yet somewhat cheesy animated fight scene between Scar and Simba takes place and Simba takes his place in hte great and glorious kingdom as he gives a roar and the dark dingy Pride Rock that Scar had ruled over had now become a beautiful Pride Land again!<br />Definatly a must see for not just kids or the young at heart, but anyone who has ever had something bad happen to them and wanted to give up, this movie will help you to move on and to look at the brighter side of things! So weather you are 1 or 101 you will love this great Disney Masterpiece! I guarantee it!
B0000024Z7|4.0|This is Santana's Fourth album and instrumentally his best of the 70's works. This album contains Neal Schon on guitar, Mingo Lewis on percussion, Tom Coster on keyboards and Gregg Rolie on organ. After this album Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon left the Santana Band to form Journey. This album also includes some of the best percussion work and, with the exception of two tracks, is mostly instrumental. Some standout tracks on this album are &quot;Song of the Wind&quot;,&quot;Stone Flower,&quot;Future Primitive&quot; and the closing track &quot;Every Step Of The Way&quot; which contains each member doing their own solo. Check out the flute solo, it's amazing. If you own Santana's first three albums your collection is not complete without this and the following album &quot;Welcome&quot;.
B00004XQP4|1.0|I saw the 'warning' signs in Nimrod, their last album. Green Day are no longer the artistes we grew to love with their catchy punk songs and dejected/heartfelt pieces. <br />We all remember irreplaceable guitar riffs that accompanied `Brain Stew', the melancholy and heartfelt tunes that were `Christie Road' and `80' and the sheer reckless energy contained in `She' and `F.O.D' this last one being my favourite. Those days have gone, this album being a major departure from this.<br />It's fine if you like this album, you may even call it \\"grown up\\" whatever this means (grown up doesn't necessarily mean better). You may even say that it's good for them to demonstrate an ability to move on in musical terms. I am not here to criticise people's tastes. All I am saying is that it's definitely not the Green Day we grew to adore. Instead their songs are now almost folk-like and in my eyes a big disappointment. I'd never thought I'd say that of them. <br />The only song of any note is song 10, `Waiting' which just has something moving to it. `Fashion Victim', song 4, is the only other song I'd tap my feet to. ...<br />I can no longer say I await their next release with bated breath.<br />Sigh!
B000050XEI|4.0|I am a huge fan of Enya's work and have most of her C.D.s so of course when I heard she had come out with a new one I was already out the door. I bought it and listened to it more than once before I decided that she could have done better. I thoroghly enjoyed, don't doubt me there, but I thought that it sounded much like her others and that there wasn't really anything new about it. I feel she could have put a little more effort into it, but, hey, at least she came out with another C.D. I am not putting her down, all I'm saying is that she could have done better. But I still love her music!
B000002BE9|5.0|This is probably one of the best CD's I've ever heard. I found myself drowning in her sullen aptitude four years ago when I bought this and am still caught in her current of succession. Her lyrics are dark and poetic and far-beyond her 18 yrs., shedding some talent in this time of mindless pop... In the past her Grammy was well-deserved, and though I think that 'When The Pawn' is a step down the ladder from this, she's well deserving of many more. Her tone is powerful and thick with passion, her piano playing exceedingly good for her age. Fiona has real finesse when it comes to creating unforgettable melodies that will stick in your head for years to come...<br />Highlights for me include Sleep To Dream, Sullen Girl, Slow Like Honey, The First Taste, Never Is A Promise, and Pale September.<br />Highly recommended for fans of rock that's moody yet classy too.
0679721037|4.0|The book Hiroshima by John Hersey is a brief literary work written about the experiences of six different people who survived and witnessed the Bombing of Hiroshima. The book was very suspensful, leaving you hanging at the end of each page, quivering for the next thrill of foreboding. The book does not judge America's decision in using the Bomb. The book does not take Japan's side, or even America's side in the War topic. No matter what the readers views are, this book is extremly valuble to those fact thirsty and to those WWII students. It's compelling and raw and we Four Mercy Girls strongly recommend this book for a new slide on your view finder.
0553108034|5.0|Yes i just gave this book five stars. I never thought I would ever give a book five stars but it has happend with A clash of Kings. Here's why.<br /> I grew up reading fantasy all through my teen years. Tolkien, Feist, and Goodkind used to take me to another world and take me away from everything. Now that im older none of these authors (well except Tolkein of course!) can give me that same feeling. That was until I encountered Geroge R R Martin. Here is fantasy for grown ups. <BR> What really appeals to me about George R R Martin's books is that it doesn't do what most modern fantasy writing seems to do. There are no black or white characters, there are no immortal-all-powerful characters who never seem to be in any sort of danger (and therefore, in my opinion, are not worth caring about). There is no done-to-death plot about an ordinary person who against his wishes suddenyl is thrust in to a hero role. No huge magic, bad writing (which most fantasy writers these days seem to be guilty of)<BR> What this series has is realistic characters who are guilty of displaying emotions, making bad decisions and acting and reacting as you would expect people in the situations that these characters are in to act. This is what appeals to me about Mr. Martin's writing. It is real and substantial, the characters seem alive and multi-dimensional. This is what fascinates me about this series, it is character driven. <BR> This is fantasy for adults. There is no holding back with anything. Sex, violence, language. Some people (and some of the reviews) named these as the bad points of the book but I think the opposite. After all, if you dont like certain parts of the book simply skip through them. This is not Jordan or Feist after all.<BR> Finally a fantasy series that resembles reality more than a cartoon series! This series has me absolutely hooked! Long live George R R Martin and A Song of Ice and Fire! After reading this series I can't go back to any other author (well maybe DavidGemmel but that's an entire different ball game....)
0131103628|5.0|Concise ..and to the point explanation of the C programming language.<BR>K and R explain the language syntax and semantics in a succinct manner, that makes the reader understand C in record time.<BR>This book serves as an invaluable reference on my bookshelf.
B00003CXA6|3.0|Read Shaara's book -- fast-forward to the battle scenes.<br />Filmed on location, some of the visuals are truly memorable, despite easy-to-spot multiple uses of the same scene.<br />I did buy a copy after seeing it more than once, but there are serious problems here for the student of history or cinema.<br />Martin Sheen as Robt E. Lee is a gross disappoinment.  It's as though he were reading cue cards, his accent sometimes on the wrong syllables even -- does Sheen speak English as a second language?  He makes a better Bill Clinton.<br />Whoever plays J.E.B. Stuart fails miserably to capture anything of the man but his tardiness at the battle.<br />Too many &quot;we're fighting to free the slaves&quot; references to be stomached by any serious student of the war, or any Southerner in particular.  There are no blacks anywhere in the Army of Northern Virginia, despite the documented presence of literally thousands throughout the war.  The obligatory runaway slave in broken manacles and the rousing &quot;War-to-Set-Other-Men-Free&quot; speach by Joshua Chamberlain is completely over the top.  FF.<br />The accents are generally contrived -- the dialogue is poorly written.  It sounds more like 5th grade backyard drama than 18th century Americana.<br />Longstreet, is not bad, but for the accent, the wierdly wagging false beard, and incredibly HUGE hat.  Other than that, great job by Tom Berenger.<br />Finally, the blubbering representation of Armistead crying over his erstwhile friend Hancock is nauseating in the extreme -- it goes on so you would almost think the two were lovers.<br />Battle scenes were definitely the highlight.  Some weak long shots consisting of poorly painted mattes.<br />JEFF WHITE<br />Major, United States Army MS, DMSM
B000059WH0|5.0|This indeed was Jeff's last TOTO recording and one of his best! Yes, this music is a departure from TOTO IV. Any real TOTO fan is deathly ill from those who only refer to<BR>this great band from their landmark Grammy winning fourth album. If this band has any odd LP's or departures from their sound, it has to be Turn Back (3rd) and Isolation (5th).<BR>When lead singer Bobby Kimball left after TOTO IV, they reached with Fergie Frederiksen for the one LP and then went with two sporting Joseph Williams (Fahrenheit &amp; The 7th One). Williams was great. After a break period, Kingdom of Desire and Tambu<BR>had Lukather with lead vocals. Bobby's back with Mindfields and it's TOTO IV all over again. So those who love IV will love Mindfields. I always hear tunes from Kingdom as intros to the Guitar Center ads... If you are a TOTO fan, this is a MUST. Clearly TOTO is the most versatile band alive. Jeff was a master of the shuffle (MAMA on Hydra), the jazz shuffle (Pamela on The 7th One), 16th note groove (Lion on Isolation and the classic, 99<BR>on Hydra), Triplet (Hold the Line on TOTO I). He played every note to count and his time, feel, and groove were the best for pop rock music. Check out TOTO's web site; TOTO99.com and  see the discography for this session monster. Also, check out the tribute CD to Jeff by Daiid Garfield and Friends titled,Tribute to Jeff on Zebra Records. Most of today's session drummers are on this CD; Ferrone, Erskine, Weckl, Hayward, Keltner, Imboden, Bissonette, Colaiuta, Joe Porcaro, Laborel Jr, Hamphrey, Gadd, and Phillips. Same is true of percussion, bass, guitar, and vocals. It really is a who's who on one CD.
B00005B3Z6|1.0|I heard all the raves about this show so I tuned.  Frankly I could not see what all the fuss was about.  It was absolutely pretentious and obviously done to shock.  As far as I am concerned it fits into every gay stereotype that I have ever heard.  That gay men are imature, irresponsible, mysoginistic and promiscuous.  Stuart is a pig and Vince is a moron. Nope doesn't do much of a positive spin on gays.<br />  Surprisingly I found the American version (though I often think of it as being Canadian since it is shot in Toronto) much much much more interesting.  The characters are more varied and the show covers all sides of the human dichotemy.  And SURPRISE NOT JUST THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GAY!!!!  I hope from the bottom of my heart that Showtime puts the entire first  season on DVD.
0440234743|5.0|In this Book its John Grisham at his best and that's all Ive to say
B000001ZS3|5.0|Its a mysterious trip through time and space, where you meet thousands of galaxies and alien organs. You are floating smoothly, feeling no fear, despite of unknown and strange voices. Every sounds takes you higher, drives you faster, leading you to the places you have never been before but always wanted to go. And in the end you are thankful for the driver, the genius behind this. Take this trip and come back smarter.
B000002LKU|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. Your Own Sweet Way is typical charming, ironic MK. This is one of those CD's you can listen to over and over and still find something you missed hearing. The title of the group and the CD have that subtle humor we know and love about MK. I know they called this a &quot;one off&quot; but I sure wish the Billies would get back together
B000002UVZ|5.0|By the time this album was released when I was in college, Murmur and Reckoning were already in heavy (constant) rotation in my car's tape player.  (I've still never had a CD player.  But I digress.)  Life's Rich Pageant was confusing, uplifting, inspirational, and just different than anything I had ever heard.  It's poetic, powerful, and beautiful.  While Murmur remains my favorite REM, I'd recommend Life's Rich Pageant first to people familiar with their latest material and ready to explore REM's early work.
6305648522|5.0|Guiseppe Tornatore's masterpiece proves for once, and for all, that you can indeed go home again. &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; is a timeless tribute to family, friendship and love as seen through the eyes of Toto, a filmmaker, who abandons his small town roots in search of that elusive &quot;something more&quot; in life. In a truly universal manner, Toto experiences success, failure, love and emptiness prior to the film's beautiful finale in which life's true meaning becomes clear to him. The childhood relationship between Toto and his father figure Alfredo, a projectionest at the local cinema, is the centerpiece of the film. Their ensuing lifelong friendship is simply priceless. The legendary Ennio Morricone's unforgettable score provides the perfect emotional backdrop . Overall, &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; is a stunning film that works on all levels. A word of warning: even the most macho of all macho will have trouble holding back tears during the film's remarkable final 15 minutes. Not to be missed!
B00000269M|5.0|Never again will an artist like Michael Jackson grace the planet of the earth.  As a kid growing up in the late 80's early 90's I thought this guy was god.  I'd listen to &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; almost every night, and was hypnotised everytime one of his videos came on or was interviewed on tv (remember the Oprah interview?).  Those were the good ol' days.  I can remember feeling absolutely radiant whenever I heard &quot;smooth criminal&quot; or &quot;Another part of me&quot;, I'd relive the Captain E.O. experience every time.  My other all time favorite is &quot;leave me alone&quot;, which wasn't on the &quot;BAd&quot; album when it first came out. <BR>    I remember reading that when this album came out Michael was criticized as being the worst male vocalist of the year.  I've never heard such utter nonsense in my life.  Nobody puts more emotion and heart into singing than Michael Jackson. The tone of Michaels voice is inexpressible, all i know is that when i hear it it makes me feel really good.  God, thank you for giving us Michael Jackson!
B000050IL0|4.0|Of course Glenn Gould has always been known for his Bach playing abilities. And if you buy this DVD you won't be dissapointed. His playing is superb. Technique is fantastic and his interpretation of the piece is first rate. It's always entertaining to watch because of how freaky old Glenn looks at the piano so low on his chair and his always disturbing &quot;other hand conducting&quot; thing he does. Anyway, the DVD picture quality is pretty good considering it was filmed almost 20 years ago. Sound is excellent. The only reason i thought this only deserved four stars: 1. A large attraction of DVD's are the extras. i would say this one has little to none. 2. Murray Perahia's recent recording of the work (available on cd) is  preffered by me and most people. Murray is just as able as Glenn and his performance is authentic only his playing is much more charming <BR>and he adds so many beautiful ornamentations on the second repeats. But this is worth the money to add to you collection.
B00000AFHM|5.0|Last year I first heard belle &amp; Sebastian, though I had promised myself not to get addicted to 1 band ever again, and healthily spread out my musical tastes over as many bands as possible, i failed again. On first hearing they seem a bit like happy, 60's pop. But after listening a couple of times, the depth comes out and the great lyrics come through + the music is melodiously layered by the many instruments they play. For some sort of reason it seems possible to listen to their cd's continuously for more than a year.<br />The boy with the arab strap is only 1 of they're good cd's. It has great songs like The boy with the arab strap and  Dirty dream nr. 2.  Of all their cd's only the last one (fold your hands...) is slightly less pleasurable to me. <BR>And strangely enough also their ep's/singles are great. Their singles don't contain any songs from their cd's but have great songs off their own.
B00005KHJM|3.0|The Wicker Man is one of those titles I have heard and read a lot about, but for one or reason or another haven't seen. Until now. I found WM to be an underwhelming film experience primarily due to Robin Hardy's very uneven direction. In the documentary available on the DVD, mention is made that Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now was also in production by WM's backers (British Lion)around the same time. I certainly think Roeg could have pushed the basic elements of WM further - Summerisle's isolation, the sexual uber-text, the tension between the repressed policeman and the liberated Lord Summerisle and his subjects, the underused locations, etc. I have admired and enjoyed Anthony Schaeffer's other screenwork, but found it hard to believe he labored on the WM to create the ultimate British horror film. While there is much to discuss about the film as a case-study in studio interference and for the presence of such cult film stalwarts as Christopher Lee, Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt, I am still mystified by the lofty status of this particular film. Granted there are some striking sequences - particularly the concluding sacrifice - but you have to wade through the cinematic equivalent of 'dead air' to get to these moments. But hey, I am not big on the Rocky Horror Picture Show either. Intriguing making-of documentary and promo spots with the extras, but I am holding out for the Don't Look Now DVD.
B00005LMBK|4.0|The only reason i bought this is because i heard automator was producing a good amount of the album, someone who happens to be a great producer, and responsible for some of the decades best hip hop albums. (Dr. Octagon, Deltron 3030, Handsome Boy Modeling School, among others.) Automator's latest project, the gorillaz, is a very fresh album. The guy from Blur sounds fresh over these crisp automator beats, as do the guests. (Del, Ibrahm ferrier.) Some of the albums best tracks include the experimental tracks &quot;double bass&quot;, and &quot;sound check.&quot; Other highlights include the infectious &quot;5/4&quot; as well as &quot;rock the house&quot; feat. Del, and &quot;Latin Simone&quot; feat. Ibrahm Ferrier. If your into experimental pop music or Automator's production, then this is highly recommended. For Automator's best production check Dr. Octagon.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|My title pretty much says it all. This movie had it all and I can't wait for it to come out so I can buy it on DVD.
0425107469|5.0|In WATCHERS, Dean Koontz weaves some of his most powerful, recurring themes into a story so compelling it demands to be read again--and again! Dangerous government experiments run amok; characters tortured by terrible childhoods and fears of losing those they love most; and the redemptive power of love and hope. These themes serve to give this novel an emotional punch that few thrillers can match these days.<br />Perhaps Koontz's greatest accomplishment with this novel is that the story succeeds on so many levels. Readers who appreciate finely-tuned phrases and scalpel-clean, lyrical prose can delight in the prowess of a master wordsmith. Other readers, seeking only a story that delivers an entertaining plot, will be riveted by the twists and turns and &quot;Oh, My God&quot; moments that this story delivers. Lastly, those readers who have followed Koontz's career for many years can read WATCHERS simply to appreciate the spectacular progression of this author's skill.<br />I've read WATCHERS many times, and every time, I pick up a technique that I can apply to my own suspense novels. Needless to say, this book has gained the &quot;must read, then re-read&quot; status on my personal reading list!
B00005J6UP|5.0|I remember watching THE GOONIES as a child and loving it.  Now, I can share in the enjoyment of watching it with my children.  This is probably the most complete DVD available today.<br />THE GOONIES is a wonderful story of a bunch of friends that experience the magical ties and bonds of their friendships.  It is a classic story of good vs. evil, and Steven Spielberg did a wonderful writing it.<br />A group of friends are out in search of &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Willie's hidden treasure in the hopes of stopping a land developer from taking their homes.  Once they find the pirate's map in their attic, the wild fun begins as the group is put through many rigorously challanging tasks in their quest.<br />The film moves along at a rapid pace, with excellent acting, witty dialogue, and a nice, cohesive storyline that is fun and easy to follow.  You can't help but cheer for the Goonies to succeed in their search.  <br />Besides the entertaining film, the DVD is loaded with some super extras.  A Cyndi Lauper music video, three never-seen-before scenes, and some excellent commentary by some of the actors are just a few of the perks of the DVD.<br />This movie is nothing but fun, and with the help of a super, colorful cast of actors, THE GOONIES is a very enjoyable experience.  It is a pleasure to watch the magic unfold on the screen.  This is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by everyone, especially people with children.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|As a film buff (including noir), it is rare that I ever get truly annoyed at a file for wasting my time.  Memento was a complete time waster.  I read these five star reviews here and wondered if it was me?  My girlfriend thought the same, and of 20 people in my neighborhood who are fellow dog walkers, 18 said two thumbs down.  And, these are very intelligent people. <br />Telling a story in reverse has been done before.  (See 1977's And Now My Love.)  But the 5 minutes forward, 10 minutes back every 5 minutes.  It was worse than a migraine.  I had to watch it in two sittings, I got so tired of TRYING to follow it.  <br />Yes, there were moments when I said &quot;Oh!&quot;<br />Yes, the acting was excellent.  But this movie probably resembled what pre-editing looks like!  And inexpicable black and white scenes.  The DVD really needed a directors commentary to explain what the heck was going on - after you'd seen it.  <br />And the ending?  That wasn't an ending.  You still had no idea - I waited with baited breath to see if the right guy had been killed.  Still no idea.  And, frankly, who cares!!!<br />This movie is making headlines because it was not conventional.  The final scene in Basic Instinct was subtle - and that movie made headlines without the need to go back to front.     <br />One fatal flaw.  If you did suffer from this condition, you would forget that suffered from it, period.  Wasn't it convenient that he only forgot certain things like beer others spit in (who wrote that rubbish?) and not the fact the he forgot things period.  Which means he also forget to write notes.  Because he wouldn't remember why he was even writing them!!!  <br />Where was the score?  <br />Yes, the movie drew you in.  It mezmorized you.  It made you think for 90 minutes (or was it 90 minutes.)  And then left you hanging at the end.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a movie that demands attention and you will want to watch it several times.  It's fast-paced, and told in reverse.  To make you REALLY pay attention, everything you see and hear is from the perspective of the main character (brilliantly acted  by Guy Pearce) who has short term memory loss.  Since the plot line is reversed, it grows more complicated at the story progresses and challenges you (along with the main character) to solve the puzzle.  My best advice for the first time viewer is to sit back and enjoy the ride.  You can worry about figuring out the details later!
6303011012|3.0|I have bought (2) copies of this video prior and both have been &quot;borrowed&quot;. This copy I'm putting under lock and key. The music and performance is excellent and it would seem that anyone who likes Yanni wants to have this video...would highly recommend
B00004XOWM|1.0|The sooner we quit comparing how great every other nu-metal/rap-metal band is in comparison to Limp Bizkit, the quicker these bozos (LB) will disappear from sight.
B000009QPE|5.0|This album will always take me back to 1986. I was a senior in high school, and I had some friends who had been trying to convert me to speed metal for at least a couple of years. (I was a devout punk.) They tried repeatedly with Ride the Lightning, Hell Awaits, Haunting the Chapel, To Mega Therion, Bonded By Blood... and repeatedly they failed. Finally they succeeded with Reign In Blood. (To be fair, Master of Puppets was also part of the equation.) I've been listening to it on a more or less regular basis for 15 years now. I've never bothered to compile one of those 'Desert Island' lists, but this would definitely be one of the first albums on it.<br /><br />Every band has a peak in their career. This is Slayer's. That's not to say that the rest of their albums suck. Just that Reign In Blood towers miles high above the rest of their material. This is just one of those rare albums where the planets aligned and everything fell perfectly into place. It has a certain aggression and violence to it that they've never repeated. Each song is as good as the last, there is absolutely no filler. The production is nigh perfect. Somehow everything in the mix was pushed forward; it literally sounds &#34;in your face.&#34; Well, except for the bass guitar. I used to wonder if there was actually any bass recorded on this album. Perhaps Tom was putting all of his effort into the vocals... I think this is his best performance. He sounds positively maniacal, and he's never sounded quite like this on any other album. Perhaps most surprising is that virtually every single lyric that comes out of his mouth is perfectly intelligible. But the real meat of this album is Hanneman and King and Lombardo all keeping up with each other and making it sound easy. Obviously, faster thrash came later, thanks to bands like Napalm Death... but nothing anywhere near this demonically complex and brutally satisfying.<br /><br />The bottom line about this album is that until Reign In Blood, &#34;speed metal&#34; basically sounded like a Judas Priest album played at 45 RPM. Reign In Blood took it to the next evolutionary phase.<br /><br />EDIT: 10/7/08 -- I just finished reading the 33 1/3 book about this album, which I definitely recommend to all fans. It mentioned something in passing that I think could possibly explain what the &#34;secret sauce&#34; was that makes Reign stand out from the rest of Slayer's catalog. The one and only record that was ever named as a direct influence at the specific time they were writing Reign was DRI's album Dealing With It, which was released right around the same time Slayer released Hell Awaits in Spring 1985. Yeah, that would do it. Too bad they didn't have influences of that caliber when they made the rest of their albums.etal&#34; basically sounded like a Judas Priest album played at 45 RPM.

B000000OU0|5.0|This is one of the best CD's in my collection. Unlike some of the newer pop ballads which I just get tired of listening to after awhile, I never get tired of this album. This is the one album I think of when I search through my entired collection.
0385335482|5.0|Although this novel was hilarious in some parts, I felt I was reading my diary.  Goodness, I wonder how many other women out there felt that way!  I'm passing this book on to my 'shopaholic' buddies.  =)

6305327041|4.0|Like many of the people who have written negative reviews for this movie, I wasn't especially excited about this movie after the first couple of segments. However, by the end of the movie I was intrigued enough to watch it one more time. That led to another viewing, and another. Suddenly, I was hooked. Sure, it's not the greatest movie ever made, and there are people who will absolutely hate it. There's really not much to say to those people; the plot is absurd and the characters aren't much better. It really grew on me though, and it's possible that it could grow on others who would give it a chance.
B00000D9TK|5.0|Slow, sweet, and relaxing. Though I have no idea what she sings on this whole album, nevertheless I have to say French is a very beautiful language, combined with Celine Dion's voice, this is one of her best works, different from her usual power ballads, but definitely worth the money.

0375707972|4.0|Admittedly, this seems to be one of those books that you either love or you hate, but I really enjoyed it. Perhaps that is because I lived in Germany for three years as an adolescent in the early 1980s, where I experienced firsthand the average German's reluctance to discuss the Holocaust.<BR>The first half of the book follows the illicit love affair between 15-year old Michael, and his 30something lover, Hanna, in post-War West Berlin. The affair ends when Hanna disappears. Michael doesn't see her again until years later, when he is a law student, and Hanna is on trial for a terrible crime. As the jacket states, &quot;As he watches her refuse to defend herself, Michael gradually realizes that his former lover may be a guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.&quot;<BR>Ultimately, &quot;The Reader&quot; explores the legacy of shame wrought on the post-War generation of Germans by the atrocities committed by their forebears in the Holocaust. Through the story of Michael and Hanna, Schlink exposes the dilemma facing Germans of his generation: reconciling the love they feel for their parents and grandparents with the realization that those very same people allowed the &quot;unspeakable&quot; to happen, either through direct participation or through silent acquiescence
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is utterly original and extremely well made.  I can't get this movie out of my mind.  I'm definitely adding this to my DVD collection
B0000029LG|5.0|Hey if you like good dance music, and like those 80's and early 90's pop.  This is the cd to buy.  With great hits like &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot;, and countless more, Michael Jackson's History is one of the greatest collections of Pop music.  Michael Jackson who has inspired so many of the popular pop artists in the modern day, is one of the greatest performers of all time.  Michael blends dance and music perfectly, because of this his music is easy and fun to dance to.  Believe me if you like any of the new artists (Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, N'Sync, Backstreet Boys), then you will love the man who started everything in the pop world.  Buy this cd and you will know why Michael Jackson is the &quot;King of Pop&quot;!!!
B00004XQ83|5.0|Country music is so misunderstood. These days, anything from Garth Brooks to Faith Hill to LeAnn Rimes is considered country music, when really their music caters more to the commercial market (aka pop music enthusiasts). <br />Whether it's bluegrass, folk, gospel, blues or traditional country - the soundtrack to the Coen brothers' film showcases real country music at its rawest best. Don't expect any familiar names on the list, except perhaps Alison Krauss and Emmylou Harris, but do look forward to some great singing and melodic tunes. <br />The main song from the album is I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow, appearing as many as four times - one instrumental (acoustic guitar) from five-time Grammy nominee Norman Blake and another one (fiddle) from John Hartford. <br />Fictional band The Soggy Bottom Boys sings two versions of the song (radio version and band version - not much difference really, but both are pretty good). The Soggy Bottom Boys appears in the movie, and comprises George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro. <br />However, Nelson is the only one who actually sings on the soundtrack, singing lead on the catchy In the Jailhouse Now. <br />Ralph Stanley contributes his soulful tenor on the traditional gospel O Death. The song really gets you in a mournful mood as he laments, &quot;O Death, won't you spare me over till another year?&quot; Lonesome Valley is also one of those depressing yet spiritual songs, and the Fairfield Four's deep, deep voices (bass, baritone and tenor) give a spot-on effect to the song. <br />One interesting &quot;song&quot; is Po Lazarus, the album opener. Sung by James Carter &amp; The Prisoners, it's a 1959 recording of a prison chain gang in a Mississippi penitentiary, singing and chopping wood in unison. Their bellowing voices and the sharp raps of the axes hitting the wood makes one wonder if the fancy &quot;twings and twangs&quot; of today's music are really necessary.<br />Chris Thomas King's bluesy Hard Time Killing Floor Blues features appealing guitar work and is somewhat soothing, especially as it slowly and softly trails in the end. Krauss' take on the traditional gos-pel Down to the River to Pray (with additional voices from the First Bap-tist Church Choir of White House, Tennessee, and some of the other singers who worked on the album) is, well, uplifting. The choir's echoing harmonies make a good accompaniment to Krauss' soprano.<br />O Brother, Where Art Thou - the movie - might never make it to Malaysian cinemas, but fortunately the soundtrack has been released here. (However, as it is imported, the album might be a tad hard to find. One tip: Look for it in big music stores instead of the smaller ones.) <br />Undoubtedly, this album is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're all for good music and good singing, take a shot at it. It might just be one of the better things you've heard all year
B000002U9L|5.0|I remember first seeing Labyrinth on ITV (British television station) when I was about nine and I taped it. I watched it so many times though that the tape was getting a bit worn and so my best friend bought me a copy and I watch it all the time. I didn't know it was actually on in cinemas because I think it was only on television in England, but that's probably a good thing as David Bowie in Spandex 12 inches high is bad but a 7 ft David Bowie in spandex doesn't bear thinking about! Anyway, it's an absolutely brilliant soundtrack and an even better film and I recommend that any deprived person that hasn't seen it to go and make their life complete now. It'll have you singing 'Dance magic dance!' in no time.
6305308659|5.0|This movie is one of the most mind-boggling I've ever seen. More than a year after I've watched it for the first time, it is still opening my eyes, opening them so wide that I get sleepless when thinking about it at night.<br />For this movie is about the fate of humanity. This movie is about why it is better to suffer here on earth than any kind of beatitude in a blissful paradise. This movie is about the inevitability and the adventure of change, it just shouts CHANGE! CHANGE! CHANGE! at you, and the backwards message of the movie is that if you don't, then you'll fade to grey. This movie shows you why civilizations clinging to the past are bound to disappear like dinosaurs because you just cannot prevent change, that children will be thinking differently than parents because this is the way humanity progresses, and that the one motor for change, for putting color in our world, for making it different, is the human mind and its craving for discovery.<br />Gary Ross, you're a genius.
B000006ZZV|5.0|I can't remember how I came to pick up her first CD; maybe I had heard her sing on some movie sound track, or perhaps it was just her pretty face in the crowd on the CD rack, but ever since then I have had to buy every recording she has out. (In fact, I have one on order that is not yet released!)<BR>This one is another jewel I am happy to report! Her style is amazing and harkens back to an era when jazz/blues was king. (Isn't it still?) Her sultry voice allows one to sit back and just relax. Her songs make their point without forcing it on you, which makes them even more powerful.<BR>There are so many good tracks on this CD that I would be hard pressed to decide which one was my favorite. The angst of &quot;All or Nothing at All,&quot; and &quot;I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance;&quot; the honey laden &quot;Peel Me a Grape,&quot; the playfulness of &quot;Lost My Mind;&quot; evey one of these is a perfect gem. In short, this is a &quot;Must Have&quot; for any jazz enthusiast's collection!
0790749815|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock may be know for such classics as &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Notourious,&quot; but his best picture by far is the action thriller &quot;North By Northwest.&quot;<BR>Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is your run of the mill guy. He has a good job, he has two divorces and a loyal secretary. One day, in the Plaza Inn with some friends, he gets kidnapped by two thugs weilding guns.

After being forced to drink a glass of bourbon and drive home, he gets framed for the murder of a UN ammbasador and gets promptly arrested. <BR>Then, if that wasn't enough, he meets a beautiful, sexy girl by the name of Eve Kendell (Eva Marie Saint). He later finds out some startiling secrets about Eve that kept me in my chair.<BR>This witty film had all the makings of a classic: a big time actor, a stunning leading lady, and Alfred Hitchcock. <BR>The two greatest scences, as expected, were the cropdusting scene and the Mount Rushmore scene.<BR>Alot of people have speculated what the title means. I think it means that he has no general idea of whats going on, or no direction.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I understand why this movie may be a disappointment to those who enjoyed the first two movies in the series.  This movie is far less the typical mystery/horror movie than the other two.  While Hannibal does actually contain some more interesting insights into the operation of the FBI than the other two (its internal politics and sexism) and does illustrate some interesting investigative techniques (e.g., using experts in the perfume industry who can accurately pinpoint the sources of different scents), this movie is more of a psychological exploration.  And although it does have the goriest scenes of the whole series (although they are few and far between), it isn't much of a horror movie until the infamous dinner scene (which made even my iron-cast stomach queasy).  For one thing, it is more of a character study of Hannibal, giving more insight into his character than the other two movies do about their villians, than a mystery.  And it also requires more participation and introspection by the audience and isn't a movie you can just expect to sit back and be thrilled by.  As a result, Hannibal, brilliantly performed by Hopkins, becomes one of the most three-dimensional, multifaceted characters I've seen in the history of cinema, especially for a villian, and the movie also winds up raising questions about our perceptions of &quot;evil&quot;, etc. <br />The movie is divided into three basic sections: an introduction, the story of the Italian detective who tries to profit from tracking Hannibal in Florence, and the story of Clarice also pursuing and confronting Hannibal.  The actions of Clarice and the Italian, both of &quot;poor breeding&quot;,are contrasted to show how, e.g., one rises above her station in life, proving that class is meaningless, while the other allows himself to be sunk into a pit out of his greed.  (The Italian detective is a person who Hannibal would describe as having two low-diving starlings as parents instead of one (Clarice).)  Unfortunately, the ending of the movie is a bit too ambiguous for my taste, but the journey is very worthwhile.  Furthermore, the acting (Julianna Moore is superior to Jody Foster), music, scenery and cinematography is breathtaking (it is, as some jokingly describe it, like Merchant-Ivory's first slasher film).  Its only problem is in finding the right audience (one that is intellectual but loves horror).  A very interesting hybrid of high-brow and low-brow cinema.
0793927501|5.0|This is a GREAT movie!<BR>The acting is GREAT the scenery is GREAT the action is GREAT the storyline is GREAT Elle McPherson is bloody GREAT (and sexy)<BR>This movie is easily one of the best i've ever watched!
078401213X|5.0|This film has been compared to Lynch's Eraserhead, but it's not a good comparison (beyond the fact that both are excellent small budget B&amp;W movies with dream sequences).  This film is far more cohesive and straightforward and grounded in reality, although the main character apparently becomes increasingly neurotic as the film progresses.<br />Basically it is about a respected young mathematician with the social skills of your average hermit trying to develope a method of predicting the stock market on his homemade computer. Meanwhile an evil group (brokerage company, CIA, whatever ... their identity is not really revealed) keeps him under surveillance and tries to get him to make a Faustian deal to reveal any formula he developes to them.  Eventually he reaches a breakthrough when he becomes interested in the mystical Jewish philosophy of Kabbalah and finds parallels between it and mathematical theory.  As a result his understanding of math becomes increasingly philosophical, and he begins to note patterns in everything, learns how to predict the market and winds up being pursued by the unidentified group as well as zealous Kabbalists who all want to use him.  He also, perhaps, winds up learning to communicate with God (or else he goes insane)(or both).  This last bit of confusion is not because the movie is confusing, but because it cleverly leaves some events open to several equally supportable interpretations.  <br />Don't worry if you're not really into math or the Kabbalah, Pi is still very entertaining.  It has excellent acting and great photography (despite the obviously low budget).  But if you are into such things, the movie also does manage to make excellent parallels between theoretical mathematics and Kabbalah (however you want to spell it) while presenting both accurately, and is mind expanding and thought provoking.  Pi reflects an increasingly strong trend amongst theorists of finding parallels between pure science and mysticism (e.g. quantum physics and zen buddhism) whatever significance you might want to read into that.  My only problem with the movie is its title: the concept of Pi is not actually discussed! (At least not directly.)
B00005LC1H|5.0|Thank You...Thank You!!! This is a dream come true. I grew up with John Cleese's Fawlty Towers and I swear by all things holy and true it doesn't get any better than this! This is pure comedy, raw and genious to say the least. To have the DVD version, is just the next step up!
B00003CXTG|4.0|I found something amazing about this movie, not the movie itself but the reviews of the movie. Just look at the reviews in the &quot;Customer Review&quot; column, every time when someone gave a good rating, he/she always got &quot;0&quot; support, one the other hand, when someone gave a bad rating he/she got vasty supports. I always thought Pearl Harbor is in Hawaii,U.S.A. not somewhere in Tokyo Bay or Death Star or wherever!
0380977281|4.0|Excellent fantasy novel but Neil Gaiman's vision of faerie was inspired (as he himself admits) by Hope Mirrlees classic 1926 novel Lud-In-The-Mist which i recommend very strongly to Gaiman fans. I have just finished reading it and its superb. Currently in print in the UK (amazon.co.uk) and described by Gaiman as the &quot;The single most beautiful,solid,unearthly and unjustifiably forgotten novel of the twentieth century&quot;

B00003CWTI|5.0|I cracked up reading the comments of the folks who gave this outstanding movie 1 star. I suppose they aren't happy with a movie unless there is a car chase, and a few explosions, and a thousand bullets.<br />Forget the naysayers, forget the people who couldn't keep more than one plot line in their heads at a time. They're happier watching reruns of South Park.<br />If you want to see cinema as a work of art, this is your movie. It is not to be taken literally. It is a work of allegory. For instance, quiz shows are not live, and they don't have shows pitting children against adults, with the children besting the adults. There obviously wouldn't be a 'Seduce and Destroy' infomercial. It is all over the top to make a point. And that point is....relationships, love, and loss. What a powerful film. Yep, it's long, but well worth it. This is a must-have DVD.

B000002G7E|5.0|This was the first Velvets album i got.  After hearing droning things like Spacemen 3 Pink Floyd.  I liked it from the beginning.  I like the rythems especially on Sister Ray which could have been the only song on it.  There are so many little noises you can hear after listening to it many times.  Lou Reed's harsh spitting lyrics are great too.  Whenever someone in an apartment near me is playing annoyingly loud top 40 pop.  I love to put this on. I can see why alot of people would think it is noise especially if theyve never heard anything but classic rock or pop music.  I dont really listen to it all the time just for special occasions.

B00005AFVR|4.0|The good is most of the songs. Not all but most. American Skin, Land Of Hope And Dreams, Jungleland, and others are excellent. The trifecta of Youngstown, Murder Inc. and Badlands rocks and is intense. 10th Avenue is fun, and Out In The Street is always good. The bad is what could have been. There are songs missng that should be here. Ties That Bind which was the opener at many shows should not have been left out. Backstreets played many nights is missing along with some gems that we would have killed to have on the collection. One song that does not fit is Don't Look Back. It is annoying and does not work especially where it is placed. Sometimes you have to wonder what goes on in the Springsteen-Landau organization. The ugly is the packaging. Terrible cover and the colors are even worse. The cover pic is not bad, but it could have been much more dynamic. My conclusion is anything from Bruce Springsteen is always great as he is my favorite artist of all time. There is no better performer on the stage. What could have been on this collection is what disappoints me. It is not a true live concert CD as it is more of a highlight of the tour CD. As always, I appreciate anything Bruce records and will listen to this over and over.
B0000508U6|5.0|I'll tell you what...I was just saying to freinds how I felt the music industry is in a serious funk and in need of a major revolution.  Although Coldplay is not revolutionary, they are a welcomed breath of fresh (albeit emotionaly messy)air.  The thing that puzzles me is how i didn't read any mention of &quot;Troubles&quot; in any of the reviews.  When I heard that song on the radio, I spent an hour trying to find out which Dave Mathew's song it was that I've never heard before.  Then I accidentally stumbled onto the name of the song on a radio station web site.  I will admit, I sort of get the iclination to eat a bullet after listening to the whole cd, but when I feel like listening to emotionally complex &quot;mood&quot; music, I pop in Coldplay.  &quot;Trouble's&quot; is by far my favorite song.  The notes they hit and the convincing emotion achieved by the song encourage me to hit the repeat button my cd player.  I can't wait for the next album to arrive.
B000021YQV|5.0|I was kind of short on money but really wanted to buy this CD, and I'm glad I did. SOAD's second CD is amazing. It's full of heavy guitars infused with a surprising melodic quality, searing bass lines, and hard frantic drumming. Serj's vocals are distinct, ranging from growling and distorted screaming noises to the beautiful singing on the chorus of Chop Suey. Many of the songs are heavy and fast with brief interludes of softness. SOAD dispells the general myth that you can't be heavy and have thought provoking lyrics at the same time. For proof, look at Prison Song, and some of the words: Following the rights movement, you clamped on with your iron fist, drugs became conveniently available for all the kids. SOAD seems to be able to take their music seriously, without taking themselves to seriously, as on the song Shimmy.<BR>Some of the standout songs, in my opinion, are Aerials, with more singing than many songs and crashing riffs, Chop Suey, with its' great opening guitar work chaning into almost grating, intense guitars, and expanding into the chorus, which is one of the most melodic and high points of the CD. ATWA starts out with a slow guitar solo and soft vocals and morphs into their signature frenetic sound.  Its hard to pick favourite songs from Toxicity, as there is little to no filler on here. I also think the very short time between songs helps keep up the momentum and feel of the CD as a whole. My only complaint is that it isn't longer!
0767903862|5.0|...he penned this book to prove otherwise!<br />I bought this book reluctantly, because I thought it would be another set of, frankly, quite predictable Bryson's jokes and his annoying moralizing. It is anything but - Bryson looks at the country (too often perceived as home of thick semi-literate rednecks) with genuine interest, admiration and goodwill, and these qualities result in a very, very entertaining and informative read.<br />The chilling account of gruesome fate of Australian aborigenes is relayed with compasion and sensitivity. Horrid details do not spare the reader; at the same time, the book avoids self-righteous preaching tone which was beginning to plague Bryson's previous books.<br />On a lighter note, some people may think that Bryson's self-confessed fascination with all that is deadly and poisonous on the Australian soil is a touch excessive - but I find these factoids about murderous jellyfish et al very interesting.<br />The book reads with ease and (unlike, for example, in &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot;), you actually learn something new after you have finished it, on top of having really good time reading it.

The special effects, the meaning behind the story, the modern lingo...how many movies are any good today?  This one is.  It is great.  If you loved and appreciated the way they made Toy Story from the artistic stand point...you will be amazed at what this looks like.

0792157850|2.0|the movie starts out pretty cheesy, as when jones throws a spear and it flies like it got shot out of a cannon.  a plane flies into the mountain and the mountain is unscaved.  a raft as a safety device...c'mon, my butt hurts when i fall off the couch.  next is the natives that can speak better english than the little chinese kid short round.  i can go on...guns reappearing in indys hand after they fall fly off a cliff, water from a 1000 gallon bucket fills up a lava filled cave.  mining carts flying like a plane.  alligators that eat clothing.  people having their gun jammed and cant shoot it, but still makes a bang sound.  people running like bears.  rubber swords and pick axes used for fighting.  bad guys falling through trap doors designed for when western guys in cowboy hats attack them.  but if youre looking for a laugh, rent this...i liked it.
B0000069CT|5.0|I'd never really listened to Bruch before I bought this CD. I think I was more interested in Kurt Masur and his orchestra more than the composer. One hearing of the first concerto and I was hooked. Every time I listen to the second movement I get shivers even after a year. <br />I had misplaced the CD for a short time and almost became hysterical looking for it. The first concerto had become like a drug upon which I had become dependant. So many people have written rave reviews of this CD and only mention the 2nd and 3rd concerti. I've been a huge Mozart fan my entire life but I count Bruch's 1st concerto the most beautiful music ever written or performed.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|At first listen the album is interesting. With repeated listens it grows on you. The music is compelling and Dylan's voice sounds better than it has in a long time. There's a great variety of styles and moods in this album. My only complaint is that I'd like to see the lyrics. The album notes don't list them, and bobdylan.com has yet to post them.
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk is a story that allows a glimpse into the mind of the teenage male.  Maybe the society that would allow such an event as the Long Walk can never happen, but the willingness of the boys to take part in this 'game' can easily be imagined.  The boys are not forced to enter the game, but instead compete for a chance at what they see as the glory if they win.  Only after they ahve started and their friends fall behind around them, do they realize their small chance of actually making it through the Long Walk.  My favorite Bachman book!
B000002BYD|5.0|In retrospect, 1998's Yield seems like the completion of a very long thought. It started on the dark, chaotic Vitalogy, bending slightly the landscape of Pearl Jam's sound, and was in full force by the time the band recorded No Code. The result is that Yield has the ability to be as intense as anything Pearl Jam has made, but doesn't NEED to be the way Ten or Vs did. The band has discovered just how many other options are out there, and has grown adept at knowing just when to use them. Even the album's most powerful (and possibly best) track, Do the Evolution, relies on brilliantly sarcastic lyrics and vocals, almost danceable guitars, and an eerie choir break to drive home it's point. Had the band tried to create a song around the same subject matter in 1993, we would have been given classic rock riffs and pounding drums under a painful howl and lyrics that, while brilliant, didn't owe so much to creativity as they did to ragged fury. Angst incarnate. Those songs are long-gone and good riddance to them. The band is far too creative to fall back on them now, and Vedder's lyrical ability and state-of-mind have grown with them. What were once complaints are now merely observations. <br />It doesn't hurt the album that some of Pearl Jam's finest moments are here: Given to Fly (which has some of the finest lyrics I have ever heard), Wishlist, the aforementioned Do the Evolution, and Lowlight are almost unmatched even in this impressive bands catalogue. There aren't any weak moments on the record either (some may gripe about the red dot `song').<br />The album is excellently recorded. The textures of the gentle, brilliant (and for some dumb reason never played live) Lowlight are startling. Vedder's throaty chuckle in mid-lyric In Hiding is captured in all it's glory. The band helps the matter by meticulously finding the perfect guitar sound for every little riff or chord.<br />For the third time running the artwork is so on cue with the music and lyrical content that thealbum feels like a package, focused enough to evoke emotion from a single look in a fan of the band (a run that died when Binaural came out...not a bad album by any standards, the artwork just didn't fit). They don't get credit for it because they owe more to Neil Young, and that earthiness and well-planned sloppiness shines through, but Pearl Jam are capable of creating artwork on par with Pink Floyd. I'm talking quality, not feel.<br />Also nice is that this might be the first real Pearl Jam album. Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament both contribute lyrics to two songs for the first time (outside of Stone's exuberant Mankind on No Code), and Mike McCready provides aural backgrounds to the punkish Brain of J and the soaring Given to Fly. The musicians, who barely knew each other when they recorded their first album, were more a group of strangers in a room than a band. And by the second album Vedder's anti-social behavior was already beginning to dominate the band. That, of course, has changed (see In Hiding, a song about shutting yourself off from the world in search of enlightenment that is a bit of a continuation of the themes in No Code).<br />Creative, focused, and grounded, Yield is Ten or Vs made by a band that has lived through Vitalogy and experienced the enlightenment of No Code.
0786915749|5.0|The characters in this book are so real it's amazing! You can reach into this world &amp; touch these people. Even when you're not being told what they're saying or thinking, you know!<BR>You can hear them anyway. You can literally hear the old dwarf grumbling with every step. Most of these characters are silent-types but you can HEAR their troubled thoughts.<BR>The best parts about this story are: It's about the characters, not dragons or monster. The fantasy elements are only the settings, not the story(something a lot of fantasy &amp; sci-fi writers could learn from).<BR>Unlike Jordan, Weis &amp; Hickman don't overdescribe. They are able to paint you a graphic picture without slowing down the pace of the story with un-necessary details.<BR>And the best part of the story is once you step into the world you won't want to leave. The characters will become like friends &amp; the world they live in will be like your second home
0385486804|3.0|Chris McCandless was a well-read, intelligent, sentient young man with a lot going for him. So why did he travel from Atlanta to Alaska with little more than rice and paperback? Mountaineer and journalist Jon Krakauer tries to answer this question in this book of little more than 200 pages of terse text buoyed by the author's personal opinions and somewhat supported by those whose path Alex (once taking flight Chris assumed the name Alex Supertramp -- the Alex apparently taken from a Tolstoy work and the Supertramp never explained) crossed.<br />The story is very compelling: Chris, clearly an individual who thinks (some would say) too much, sets off on his great adventure upon college graduation without much more than a word to his parents and sister (in fact, he never contacts his parents again). In an effort to remove the shackles of materialism, he gives all his savings (close to $25,000) to charity (ironically, a charity to prevent hunger) and heads west in his old yellow Datsun. He manages fairly well (and he had been prone to solo sojourns in the past) and eventually loses his car out west. He burns the rest of his money and relies on his feet and the kindness of strangers for travel. Almost two years of travelling and vagabond living later (he did maintain some employment including a brief stint at a fast food restaurant and farm work in South Dakota), Chris heads into the Alaskan Wilderness with his paperbacks, a rifle, a .22, some ammunition, a book on poisonous plants/berries, and some rice. An idealist searching for the meaning of life (and not the lack thereof), Chris was an avid reader of the ascetic Tolstoy, Jack London, Boris Pasternak, and Thoreau. Clearly, these thinkers influenced McCandless's thinking, fed his adventurous spirit and probably added more questions than answers to his desire to decipher what this life is all about. Unfortunately, we will never know what Chris' conclusions after four months in the wilderness were, although there are some clues in his brief, but poignent journal entries.<br />Krakauer does a decent job in the telling of the story, although the writing is somewhat clipped, tenses occasionally confusing, and the feel throughout is more that of a newspaper article than a literary work--and this for me is the major weakness in this book. Additionally, the author spends two chapters telling about his adventures (and several others talking about other seekers/adventurers) in an effort to elucidate some of McCandless's motivations. This wasted space could have been better served giving more details of Chris' background. Little is said about his childhood or teenage years. Krakauer includes some of Chris' writings and shares some of the highlighted passages in the many books Chris read, but I somehow feel there could have been a lot more--high school or college papers, more interviews with friends and family. The major failing in the telling of this fascinating story is there is too much conjecture and not enough fact. Admittedly, some of this could likely not be helped considering the solitary nature of McCandless, but I still feel there was/is more to be told.<BR>Nevertheless, I would recommend this book for the story itself. It is moving, heartbreaking, in some ways uplifting (see Chris' comments alongside Pasternak's prose from Zhivago toward the end of the book to see what I mean), and definitely worth the telling.

She ends up finding out she is a great lawyer and making making new friends while saving workout extroidinare from a horrible murder charge. This is a great movie for everyone. It doesnt matter what people think of you or how &quot;blonde&quot; you are, it your determination that gets you what you want.
B00003CY0V|5.0|This movie does not depict Travolta as a villain. He is our shadow government's answer to terrorism in the world. He and his team specialize in attacking terrorists that threaten American liberties in the world at large. That Travolta's character has to resort to extraordinary means to obtain the tools and money his commission requires is logical and necessary since no government or private individuals can publically and legally support such actions. The justification of &quot;harming a few, to protect the many&quot; is the theme of the movie, in case anyone missed it!
B00000IP4H|5.0|This cd is heavy. Chuck usually sings but on this one he just growls like..uh, er, um..a growling thingy.  This is really only the cd they have made like this so if your just getting into testament then don't expect all their other albums to sound like this one.  The Gathering has death elements but it's not like this one.  People who are into testament but haven't heard this cd need to be aware that this isn't your typical testament. If you own, say, the Legacy then go out and buy this you will be take aback.  <br />Musically, it's pretty complex as Eric is the only guitar player here and he mostly just concentrates on playing shredding riffs rather than just solos.  Each song has time changes and different riffs to keep the listener intersted.  Although death metal vocally, there are a few times where Chuck sings in his older, more high pitched style.  <br />Drumming wise, it's hard to beat.  Gene is the drummer here and, as always, he is a great drummer.  I don't think he did his best here but he's still in top form.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I've never really been that fond of Metallica. Always looked at them as OK musicians without any goal or aim. Then some time ago I meet a guy who presented me to a lot of their albums and told me a bunch of anecdotes about the band. After seing the concert on television I then went down and bought the album.<br />At first I would have rated it as a 3-star. But since it is about six months since I bought the album and still listen to it daily, I must admit that it has struck something in me. And after having listened to other Metallica albums, I simply have to rate this as a 5-star.<br />The constellation - Metallica and Michael Kamen plus the San Francisco Symphony - works magic. 'Hero of the Day' has never been played better and the brand new song on the album 'No Leaf Clover' is hard just to put aside.<br />Metallica and Kamen have created a fine balance between the modern hard rock and the traditionally beautiful classic. A master piece that in my opinion haven't got the attention it deserves. <br />As Michael Kamen puts it: &quot;I live in both worlds... now, so does Metallica&quot;. And being a witness to that is truely fantastic.
0380778556|4.0|I must admit, at first I really wanted to discard Rebecca but as I had to read it for school I continued it. After the first few chapters I was so intrigued that I finished it in the one day! All the way through the book I was waiting for something to happen, very much like Mr. De Winter as it just keeps you on the edge. Suspenseful, gripping, mysterious, romantic (kinda) and a classic. A story of 2 people who live in lies, mistrust and dishonesty due to Rebecca until the secrets unfold...
B00003CXSP|5.0|When Hannibal was eating his way through theaters earlier this year, I thought to myself &quot;I can't wait for the DVD!!!&quot; I live for the behind-the-scenes stuff, so I was dying to find out how the filmmakers accomplished the effects...Gary Oldman's Verger makeup, the pigs, the climactic buffet scene....so did the DVD deliver? Pretty much. The deleted scenes were very good, and I was especially pleased to see a VERY long sequence concerning Inspector Pazzi's hunt for the infamous &quot;Il Mostre&quot;. These scenes really fleshed out the characters. The 5 behind the scenes featurettes are informative, even if there is virtually NOTHING about the Verger makeup. I really enjoyed the the poster gallery, as well. The film itself looks great, and the commentary by Director Ridley Scott is a keeper. I especially liked his overview of the 3rd ending they were considering. Couldn't they have filmed the Book's ending though?

I haven't seen a live show yet but if this film is as real as it seems to be, then, we don't only have a glimpse of the stage glamour but the bitter truth behind the curtains as well.  There's the age-old dream of &quot;rags to riches&quot; &amp; the age-old moral of &quot;what goes around comes around&quot;.
0679437223|5.0|Laugh out loud funny at times, Heller's catch 22 will bring you quickly through an otherwise unfunny topic.  Irony is dripping from every page, as Heller twists and turns the absurdity of war and the associated absurdity of the political aspect of war into one massive reality check.  A fantastic read.  As far as the actual book itself, as with all everyman's editions, the quality of the book is first rate.

B00005JCAA|5.0|I love this movie but it's an odd duck. Most of the complaints about it concern its length. Yes, it's long. But I have not found it too long - I've seen shorter movies that were much longer.<br />What makes this movie odd is that it has the gauzy, high production look of Hollywood but the film has a European sensibility in that scenes tend to be lengthy. Martin Brest lets his characters actually have dialogues, complete with normal human pauses, very much similar to a European approach. If you're conditioned by rock-videos, then you'll find this a bit hard to take, I suppose. But I like the way it allows the story to breathe and unfold at its own pace.<br />At the core of the movie is Anthony Hopkins character and the film really owes a lot to Hopkins' performance. He clearly carries the film, but quite effortlessly. <br />It should also be noted that this film lands solidly in the field of romance - of the Shakespearian variety, not Harlequin. Also, the overall look of the film is gorgeous. It's a great film to simply look at. And the film's score by Thomas Newman is both beautiful and perfect.

B00004SWBD|5.0|As far as death metal go's this is a wicked album. the one drawback to slipknot is that they are manufactured (like the westlife of metal) i went to seee slipknot at ozzfest uk in 2001 and heard their new album iowa . as good as that is (and it is)   it is not a patch on this album. it is slipknot's 2nd album and their best. if you are into heavy metal don't rule out slipknot because they are manufactured,they are a very good band. i don't class them as death metal but they are very heavy metal.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|I am a huge fan of movie orchestra music.  The music greatly enhances your emotional reaction to what you are watching and nobody does it better than John Williams.  Whether he frightens you with his simple but ominous theme from Jaws, or excites you with his pulse-pounding themes from Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars, or saddens you with his haunting theme from Schindlers List.  The thing that impresses me most about him is that despite the fact that he has been composing scores for over 30 years, he still manages to create a huge variety of different themes for a vast number of different movies.  I am especially impressed with how he can create a completely different score that still carries similar themes for movies and their sequels (for example: The Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies).  This CD features an incredible variety of some of his most memorable movie themes and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys not just John Williams' movie scores but movie scores in general.
0812550706|5.0|I hesitated reading this book for YEARS because I had already read the short story, and figured that knowing the ending would ruin the book, but Scott Card has made the story much more robust and added many subplots that weren't there in the original.  Plus the added little twist at the end that makes you question your impression of the aliens.  I found it thorougly enjoyable and look forward to Speaker For the Dead.
1570627215|4.0|This was a beautiful moving tale of one mans' journey to enlightenment.  He reaches perfection by shedding and attaining several different identities; first, he is a Brahmnin's son; second, he is an aesthete and shramana; third, he is a hedonist and wealthy gambler; then, finally, he is a ferryman and lover of a river.  Finally he reaches perfection.<br />Ideas mean little to him in the end, and unity is everything.

B00004TH83|4.0|On first listen, I did not like this CD much. Upon, relistening, I understood it better and enjoyed it, and it has become one of my favorites of the newer releases. Lara Fabian has been around for quite some time and has only just begun to enjoy a degree of success this side of the Atlantic. I found her vocals initially to be too acrobatic, similar to a Star Search contestant. The problem with Fabian is that she sounds like three great vocalists: Celine Dion, Connie Francis, and Barbra Streisand. She is dramatic as all three are, and her vocals now and then can be confused for Dion or Streisand. Perhaps no one has had more global influence than Francis, and she was certainly a versatile vocalists, able to very competently perform just about any form of music. Fabian attempts this on this CD, moving from ballads, to dance, to ethnic. Francis' handling of her music was with quite a natural voice. Fabian needs to develop a more solid style of her own, and needs to periodically simplify her vocals.
6302054982|2.0|Pauline Kael wrote: &quot;Martin Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; has a lift.&quot; Well,<BR>not for me it didn't. It's a well-made movie, tho the dialogue falls<BR>flat at times: the colours, the lighting, the camera angles, it's<BR>all very well done. Compare De Niro's &quot;Bronx Tale&quot; which all seems to<BR>take place in boring daylight or brightly lit interiors. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; opens<BR>with an atmospheric car interior. When the wiseguys get out and stand<BR>around the boot (from which the strange knocking sound is coming), they<BR>are lit by the ominously blood-red rear lights of the car.<br />But as for the characters, all I could think throughout this movie was<BR>&quot;they're stupid!&quot; As in &quot;Bronx Tale&quot;, the story is told (mostly) from one<BR>point of view - Henry Hill, who, as a kid who lives in the area of a mob, admires them, then<BR>grows up to be one of them. We see what he sees of them, but not what he sees<BR>in them: without Henry's explanation, we would have no idea.<br />As Pauline Kael wrote, we see all the characters from the outside only -<BR>I didn't get a sense of them from the inside at all. When a close friend<BR>is assassinated by the very mob he's in, De Niro's character goes nuts, <BR>but does it give him pause for thought? Does he question his loyalty?<BR>Apparently not: he goes berserk, then gets over it, and life goes on<BR>as before. <br />Joe Pesci's character offhandedly kills a young boy who annoyed him.<BR>The cold-blooded murder seems to upset Henry Hill, but again it's only<br />momentary and quickly forgotten. Did this and other sickening acts of<BR>violence (burying a body then having to dig it up again 6 months later,<BR>for instance) lead him to turn traitor in the end? The movie gives no<BR>clue.<br />When Henry runs out of luck and money, and comes to boss Pauly for <BR>cash and forgiveness, he repents, and Pauly gives him something but<BR>then turns his back forever. Because we don't know whatis really<BR>going on in Henry's mind, the tears of contrition sound and LOOK fake.<BR>Henry is incensed at the tiny amount of money Pauly gives him (a mere<BR>$3,200!), yet Pauly comes out of the scene with more moral integrity<BR>and generosity of spirit than Henry. This makes Henry's final betrayal<BR>seem an ignoble thing, and perhaps it's meant to.<br />The early part of the movie describes the early part of Henry Hill's<BR>membership in the clan, and it's all positive - the thrills, the money, the glamour, the girls, the power. The latter part is how<BR>all this unravels. Yet the movie's opening scene comes from the latter<BR>part of the story, and therefore shows us the extremely violent side of being<BR>a gangster right from the start. This doesn't make sense in terms of<BR>narrative, only in it's shock value: it's certainly a scene that grabs<BR>you by the gut, and makes you terrified of Joe Pesci's character from<BR>then on in.<br />For me, the glitter and excitement of a gangster's life is so clearly outweighed<BR>(in the movie) by the tawdriness, the violence, simply the consequences of a gangster's<BR>actions that there was never a moment when I didn't think &quot;they're complete idiots!&quot;,<BR>and I think this is the movie's biggest detraction. Apparently Henry never thought<BR>his wife might not like him having a mistress (she doesn't) and might do something<BR>about it (she does!). When Henry and Jimmy beat up a recalcitrant client, they never<BR>think his wife might not like it (she doesn't) and might go to the police (she does!). <BR>When Tommy murders a &quot;made man&quot;, all 3 realize he did a stupid thing, but pretty soon<BR>they forget about it and assume everyone else does, too (they don't). <br />I didn't come out feeling uplifted or exhilirated; I didn't come out feeling I'd learned something about human nature, that gangsters are human and have the same doubts and hopes as the rest of humanity; instead I came out feeling terribly superior: these guys have garlic for brains, they're complete morons! Watch out for Henry's wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco - a great performance). As the credits roll, we hear Sid Vicious doing his trashy send-up of Sinatra's famous &quot;My Way&quot;, and for me that says it all: these guys thought they were it, but their very arrogance was rubbish, not even the nobility of a tragic downfall.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks is a one-of-a-kind songwriter and singer whose lyrics and voice epitomize rock and roll.  After owning this CD and listening to it dozens of times over the past several months, I recommend it enthusiastically.  If you just want to kick back and enjoy the sound, this disk does the trick.  If you are in a contemplative mood and want to delve into the thought behind the words, this disk allows it.  And if you want to just spend an hour hearing a woman sing with genuine intensity and feeling, this CD should be a part of your collection.  If you enjoyed Stevie's work with Fleetwood Mac and her previous solo efforts, you will not be disappointed.
B000002GB9|5.0|Oh man, how I can I express this album? It is one, or the, Styx masterpeice. Come Sail Away is probably the best song on that album, though they're all excellent. I absolutly love Come Sail Away. That song is so moving, so inspiring, so imaginative. Dennis DeYoung himself said that that one probably his favorite song, of all the ones he's written. You can close your eyes and just imagine the places the song's taking you to. I can't elaborate enough on that song. The Grand Illusion is fitting for the title track, and opener. Words and music are great, expression is too... Fooling Yourself is a great song of Tommy's though unfortunately doesn't stick in the head as much as some of the others. But Tommy sounds great on it, the keyboards are very cool, and the theme is very appropiate at times. Superstars is a pretty cheerful song, with the solioquy at the end like in a circus. Love the keyboards/organ/synthesizers at the beginning. Miss America is the only really hard rocker on there, but perfect for JY. His voice is perfect for that song, and the beginning as the Miss America theme song is very appropiate. Then there's Man in the Wilderness. THat song is very dark, but very well orchastrated and underrated. It's hard to truly describe, but it's also a song you can picture in your head. I wish I could say more abnout that song. Castle Walls is very excellent, and also quite underrated. Another very well written song, with great imagery, and dark. The bass(?) notes at the beginning are like a heartbeat, and the rest of the song carries your like you're walking along. Goes along with the theme of the rest of the album. The Grand Finale is a combination of Come Sail Away, Superstars, and The Grand Illusion, and an appropiate ending. It just wraps up the entire album rather well, with another circus-like speech, though not quite as grand-seeming. So the album seems to go from the brighter sides of the Grand Illsion that we live in, to the darker sides, transition startingwith the opening title track, to the slightly more mellow, yet rockier Come Sail Away and Miss America, to the dark Castle Walls. An excellent album, and probably my favorite (especially since CSA is on it), though I don't listen to it as much as I should. A must-have by far!
0393317552|2.0|Flaws everywhere. He calls the European Union ECC in 1997. What kind of historician is who does not know the Mastrich Treaty? In 1992 the ECC was renamed to EU, EUROPEAN UNION. He refers the ECC (the EU) as the tiniest and unsuccessful move for a united Europe, such &lt;&lt;tiniest&gt;&gt; move, for example, is the Euro, the European currency adopted by 12 members states. Lovely!
B00005NZBN|5.0|As a person who came to Bob Dylan's music later than some. It has now been 20 years + for me. I own everything he's released. Some I dislike and/or are bemused by what I heard...at first listening.<BR> Thus, was not the case with &quot;Love and Theft&quot;.<BR> Bob's most riveting and finest &quot;produced&quot; work in the past 20+ years has been arguably through the creative sonic visual genius of Daniel Lanois. These albums, &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; and &quot;Time out of Mind&quot; resulted in a remarkable body of subsequent performances with again, arguably the best band Bob Dylan has ever shared a stage with.<BR> This band and Bob's stellar songwriting and production work (yes folks, Jack Frost is Bob Dylan)has made this Bob Dylan's own individual vision fulfilled or at the very least tapped into. A development and sound that is a continuing Pheonix in Bob's career, This is Bob Dylan's Masterpiece that he spoke of that first time in the basement in Saugerties, NY.<BR> I believe after several listening's into &quot;Love and Theft&quot;. Fans, New and Old will be moved for as long as anyone has been since they first heard Subterranean Homesick Blues.<BR>As a Bonus, in this Special edition you get two song, One I had only heard Bob sing on tape in a Hotel Room in 1961 as an import. It is a beautiful piece of Bob interpretation.<BR>Times they are a-changin'(alternate version) is like an old friend with a slightly different vibe but, with no loss to it's greatness of idea, arrangement and performance.<BR>Enjoy this music from a man who knows the truth's and lived a life. Many lives really. He is so deep rooted in being human and to living in the present. This is Bob Dylan. In his most accomplished and contemporary reinvention.

B00005BJ2O|1.0|i was SO disappointed with this CD! the music in the movie is AMAZING, and the few songs that are ACUALLY ON THE CD are totally different!<br />i had really really been hoping they would have the song that nicole and evan sing, when she is with the duke, (about to do it with him) and she is looking down from the balcony and holding on to the railing, singing a beautiful song a looking at evan as he walks out of moulin rouge w/ his cute little scarf about his neck, and he is singing too, but a totally different song at the same time. and the two songs where SO BEAUTIFUL together, that i cried. i was so disapointed when it wasn't on the CD. and the ones that WERE on the CD, wheren't even the same as the movie. <BR>:-(
B00005NZBN|5.0|This CD brings us the supercharged road warrior who has crisscrossed the globe during the last four years. The weariness of Time Out of Mind has been replaced by beautiful brutal honesty.By far High Water is the highlight of the album with its bluegrass tinged style and surreal lyrics. The rest of the album is like an anthology of how Dylan percives his American musical roots. Those roots incule rockabilly, jazz, blues and pure pre-1955 pop. I highly recommend it a great companion to TOOM. God bless the families of those who died today. America, we must hang together or we will not survive. God Bless America and damn the cowards
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Ditto what everyone else said about the theatrical version's outstanding cast, direction, and screenplay. This review instead will focus on the DVD's bonus content.<br /><br />For a DVD, the added content -- one TV interview with the director, widescreen format, Dolby audio, digital video, small picture gallery -- is unexceptional. For a movie of Memento's artistic stature, a secondary soundtrack featuring commentary by the cast and director would have been greatly appreciated.<br /><br />I did discover one worthwhile goodie: Buried amid the DVD features is a collection of fictitious newspaper articles and doctors' reports that cast the main character of the movie in still another surprising new light.
B00003CXQX|5.0|Disney is well-known for their high-scale musical cartoons. Pop ballads from or inspired by their musical cartoons usually find themselves at the top of the charts. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE was supposed to be a musical like that, one with a strong moral message, lots of syrupy love songs, and breathtaking animation. However, something happened along the way. The movie took a completely different turn (why do you think the film was 1st released at the end of the year instead of the summer?) and ended up being the least serious of all Disney full-length animated features. Thank goodness! It's about time the power-mouse took a break, had some fun (without too many perverted subtlties), and made a movie that adults will probably enjoy more than children.The closest Disney flick THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE resembles is ALADDIN. However, the humor in this film is more akin to the Muppets, the Simpsons, and early Warner Brothers cartoons. David Spade is perfect as the voice of Emperor Kuzco, John Goodman is delightful as the peasant Pacha who saves Kuzco many tmes, and Patrick Warburton steals the movie as the voice of Kronk.The basic outline of the story is that Kuzco is a selfish Emperor who wants to destroy Pacha's village so he can build a summer home. He fires his advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt) because he doesn't trust her and in retaliation she plans to kill him. However, Kronk accidently mistakes a llama transformation potion for poison and Kuzco turns into one of the hairy bests instead. Yzma still wants Kuzco dead, but Krok has a conscience and can't complete the task. Eventually, Kuzco ends up in Pacha's wagon and that's all your going to get; my groove just changed.
B00005NZBN|5.0|With this latest, mighty effort Bob Dylan blows away all the pretenders who have been populating the upper reaches of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and selling us sham pop music. Now THIS is real music -- it would be a shame if only Dylan fanatics and old fogies are the only ones to listen.<br />On first spin, &quot;Love and Theft&quot; seems like a spiritual cousin to the top-selling soundtrack of &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; in that they both concern themselves with &quot;old-timey&quot; but mostly American forms of music. Dylan offers blues ruminations and Tin Pan Alley tunes and -- driving the toughest, tightest band he's fielded in years -- takes us on a whirlwind tour of American musical styles with pit stops along Highway 61 and Desolation Row.<br />This album is so rich and deep it's hard to single out one tune. &quot;Mississippi,&quot; a mid-tempo meditation, wouldn't have been out of place on &quot;Time Out of Mind.&quot; &quot;Honest With Me&quot; rocks like the old days, and &quot;Summer Days&quot; is a slap of honest-to-gosh rockabilly.<BR>And don't be fooled by the somber subject matter of Dylan's recent work -- &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is the funniest Dylan album ever. &quot;Po'Boy&quot; even has a sort of knock-knock joke.<br />Some copies come with a second CD, with two previously unreleased early Dylan songs. &quot;I Was Young When I Left Home,&quot; cut in 1961, is Bob's version of an old folk song and the other tune is a somber, quietly sung alternate take of &quot;The Times They Are A' Changin'.&quot; I get a weird feeling listening to this song, today (the day of the CD's release) while watching the news from New York and Washington. Dylan has always been rather prescient, but ...<br />In short, this is classy, absolutely assured rock music from the form's greatest practitioner. &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is assuredly the year's best CD. Highly recommended.
B00002ND77|5.0|The scene is set. Black angst, extreme predjudice, and injustice reflected through the Rodney King beating and racial tension of the '90's, and it's nothing new, because Spike Lee takes it from there. He tells us another story that happened almost 30 years prior. The story of a man, a human, a hero, a sinner and a saint, Malcolm X. <br />After seeing &quot;Bamboozled&quot; and reading the &quot;Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; by Malcolm X with Alex Haley, I thought &quot;X&quot; would be worth a look, and it really was. Spike Lee tells X's life story with amazing detail and realism. He does not gloss anything over because this is a true story. The 3+ hours that follow are absolutely astounding. Malcolm X was a man who was led on a road of strict conformity to Islam. His ideas were molded and shaped by his own experiences into black supremacy and pride. And just as he had realized his own grievances and was pushing towards a brotherhood of blacks and whites alike, the disidence he had caused amoung he own people finally caught up with him. But for his efforts to create a sense of unity and pride amoung his people, he will be a legend, a hero, a human, and a man in the greatest sense of the word. <br />Denzel Washington unleashes a full calibre performance as X, and Angela Basset does an equally performance. It's a shame that &quot;X&quot; failed to do as well as it did on screen at the Academy Awards, but it can be said that Spike Lee is definitely a man with a message. There is no other filmmaker today that captures the tension, prejudices, life and culture of the African-American lifestyle and all the issues and pertenance to our contemporary society as Spike Lee. Whether it's &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, or &quot;Bamboozled&quot;, Spike Lee captures on film the multi-faceted feelings of the people he represents and the feelings of our nation. Spike Lee is an essential component, and an outstanding filmmaker, in our culture today. &quot;X&quot; is his masterpiece, and certainly a must-see for anyone.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bob doesn't fail to deliver an amazing collection of songs, showing that not only do his roots go deep and far back in American music, but he's also keeping American blues and folk music alive and making it relevant and contemporary. Believe all the reviews you've read ...great band, great performances, an eerie, earthy vibe that's a marvel of renewal and reconnection. He's making music that is deep in the America soul, has generations of ancestors, is bold and brave, confident as a journeyman, inventive like a poet.  This is a grooving rock 'n roll, proof that his music isn't only for the young, hinting at more amazing things to come.
B00000D9TK|4.0|I do wish, however, that there were translations in the program notes.  That's a small gripe on my part though.  I have three of her other albums and this is the first of her French albums that I've added to my collection.  I quite enjoy and value it.  One can relax and listen and feel the emotion, and much of the meaning just by her singing.  I don't yet have any true favorites because each one is very enjoyable.  Highly recommended for her fans, and for those who enjoy the French feeling of the music.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dylan is a master of many different styles. From folk to rock and everything in between. Love and Theft is another example of it. Train ride a la Johny Cash (Tweed-le Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum), Chuch Berry Rock'n roll (Summer Days), country with picked banjo (High Water), violin melancholie from the thirties (Floater), all these styles can be found on the album. <br />But there is more - they are all delivered by Dylan's unique voice. Voice that has gone a long way during his professional fourty years. It sound almost absurd, like a cartoon, but it is a symbol of a certain music style or even of a life style.<br />Love and Theft is not a big detailed production work like the previous album Time Out Of Mind produced by the brilliant Daniel Lanois. Instead, it is just a band playing songs. Simple and effective. The band plays awsome. <br />Very, very, very good piece of work. Congratulations Bob!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I have just finished watching &quot;Memento&quot; on DVD and it is simply the best film I have seen all year.  I was hooked on this film from the opening sequence and even though I was in the ballpark in terms of unraveling the puzzle, the ending surprised me.  The most important thing is that the ending fit.  The idea of a man trying to find the person who raped and murdered his wife is old enough, but the twist of making the protagonist devoid of short-term memory is utterly fascinating.  But what makes &quot;Memento&quot; great is what writer/director Christopher Nolan does with that clever idea.  Those who complain that the story is one of those post-&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; films that plays around with the time should just calm down and realize the story is simply being told in a regressive manner, with each scene taking us back for the next key piece in the puzzle.  Guy Pearce turns in an utterly convincing performance as Leonard Shelby, the man with a mission but no short-term memory, with Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, the woman who appears to be helping him, and Joe Pantoliano in a restrained performance as Teddy, who cannot be trusted according to the note Leonard has penned on the back of his polaroid.  The DVD version has a few select treats: Christopher Nolan is interviewed about both &quot;Memento&quot; and his previous film, &quot;Following&quot;; the short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan, which inspired the film and was written contemporaneously; background information about the characters and events you have to searh and find in the &quot;otnemem&quot; section.  If you have seen a better film noir than &quot;Memento,&quot; I bet it was in black and white...
B00003CX95|5.0|Greatest Movie Of All Time<br />As for the DVD, an excellent use of this format.  The original documentary sheds light on the experience of making the film and Mel Gibson's commentary is superb.  On most DVDs, the commentators attempt to talk over the entire movie, this makes most DVD commentaries unwatchable, as the key insights are often marred by boring filler space.  Gibson only chimes in when he has something relevant, from key details and information like &quot;It took six weeks to film this part&quot; and &quot;that's a real scar, not makeup&quot;, to nice little moments of trivia &quot;That guy is my brother.&quot;<br />Five stars for the movie, five stars for the features.
0385335482|5.0|...you'll love Rebecca Bloomwood. This book is by no means a clone of Bridget Jones's Diary, but it has the same first-person intimacy and Becky is a character that most of us can relate to as she goes from blithe denial to finally accepting responsibility for her money woes. If you've been to Credit Card City and taken that long walk back--or if you just want a light, fun read with more than a couple of laugh out loud moments--buy this book before you go on your next budget. And keep an eye on Sophie Kinsella, this is a writer you'll want to read more of!
020530902X|3.0|and other than the spiffy new silver cover, the 4th edition of this excellent book has little to distinguish it from its predecessor. If you aspire to write well, you should read this book, and if you do not own a copy of the 3rd edition, by all means purchase this latest so-called revision. If, however, you already own a copy of the 3rd edition in serviceable condition, spend your hard-earned pennies elsewhere. I wish I had.
B0000025FG|5.0|This cd reminds me of my sister, she turned me onto all the music greats. Sammy Hagar, Black Sabbath, and ELO. This cd is such a perfect mix of pop and subtle guitar work/keyboards, it's frightening. Every song is a winner, from the upbeat Last Train to the mood setting Midnight Blue. This is the first cd from ELO that I truly love. Sure Out of the Blue has a hit or two but the albums as a whole before this had too many holes. This and &quot;Time&quot; are my favorite ELO works, and I suppose they always will be. Buy this.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Starting with the end, this brilliant thriller weaves an intriguing spiders web and culminates in the best ending since 'The Usual Suspects'.<BR>Guy Pearce (back on his 'L.A. Confidential' form) stars as Leonard, a man with brain damage sustained during a horrific attack on his wife. Leonard cannot remember short term experiences, if he talks for a few minutes he forgets what he started to say. He's trying to track down his wifes killer. which is difficult if you can't remember the clues to the puzzle.<BR>Leonard uses tattoos and polaroid photographs to remind himself of the important points, but can he trust the past?<BR>Remeniscent of Pulp Fiction in the way the timeline is de-linear, this sparkling classic will be remembered as the film which made both Guy Pearce, and the writer/director Christopher Nolan. (one to watch) Highly recommended for all fans of tight plotted braintwisters. If i could award 6 stars, i would.
B00005A46T|5.0|It's about time a band DIDN'T wuss out on their second CD.  Iowa is as hardcore as Slipknot was before.  It's not watered down to appeal to the mainstream MTV audience.  They stuck to their guns and they ROCK!
B0000399WI|5.0|This is a classic movie that should be seen by everybody.  Based on the story by Stephen King, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is a powerful movie filled with talented actors, a brilliant story, and more.<br />Morgan Freeman, who plays &quot;Red&quot;, narrates the story.  He has been in Shawshank prison for many years for murder.  It starts out like everyday.  Him and the other prisoners would run as soon as they hear the bus bringing in the &quot;new meat&quot;, and make bets on who is going to crack first.  Red bets on Andy, who is played by Tim Robins.  As it turns out, Andy went through the first night without saying a word to anybody.<br />Andy has been confined to Shawshank for being convicted of murder.  Although he maintains his innocence, it seems that nobody believes him, and for that he must serve hard time in the unforgiving prison which is filled with violent guards who are just waiting for an excuse to brutally beat prisoners to death, and a crooked warden who holds the Bible close to him.  Soon, Andy and Red become friends, as Andy does his best to never let his hopes of freedom die.  However, he sure learns that most of the people that enter Shawshank never come out human, and do not know how to handle freedom.  Still, Andy knows in his heart that he will be free someday.<br />This is a terrific film which gives the true meaning of friendship, and what one must go through in order to find the final redemption.  I would've liked it if there were more extras on the DVD, but other than that this is a must-have.  This film is brillantly directed, and the screenplay is outstanding.  Filled with heart and surprises, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is an outstanding picture.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|As a medical doctor with a neuroscience degree, I very much appreciated the intracacies of this psychological thriller which has a very real basis!  I do believe the main character over-stepped his capabilities for somebody with his condition; no amount of organization could allow someone to retain that much information.  The character would have to re-read EVERYTHING to the point where he would have forgotten it well under half-way through.  A real person with this condition actually stopped recognizing himself in the mirror because he had aged beyond the point where he was able to remeber himself.  This movie, and anyone with such a condition, is a living nightmare.  Fortunately, it doesn't appear to be overly emotionally painful for the patient.  For family members, it is obviously very painful.  Eventually, they will not be recognized either once they age sufficiently.  This is an incredible mind trip done in an extremely creative fashion-- a fashion that puts you in the main character (patient's) shoes!  This is an experience not to miss.  You will want to watch it again.  You will have to watch it again.  Tatoo it to your arm before you forget!
B00004XQ83|5.0|After I saw the movie, I was hoping a CD would be available of the soundtrack. I searched online and to my delight found the album. I love this CD!!! Wonderful sing-a-long music that always puts you in a good mood. If you liked the music in the movie, you'll love the soundtrack.

B00004R99K|5.0|Whimsical, magical adventure with terrific animation and memorable score. Entertaining introduction to classic literature, plus Walt Disney explaining animation. Promotes diversity: &quot;Everyone is different, and that is OK.&quot; Really taken with the fantasy. &quot;I would like to dream like that.&quot; &quot;It told a very funny story of things that we can't see here in this world.&quot; &quot;We also get bored with school and want to go exploring.&quot; Some kids even said they would like to read the book. Ages 5-8.
B0000029LG|4.0|first disc which includes greatest hits is good, second cd bad,scream is okay, stranger in moscow is okay, you are not alone is the best cut on here, only other song really listenable to is they don't care about us, others are weak even this time around featuring ther late notorious big. like i said the new tracks on here lack much.
B000059MEK|5.0|Ok, I was just going to give this CD a 5 star rating just cause I liked it, but I think it deserves a description even though 140 people have already reviewed it. Nonetheless...<br />I'll have to admit I first went for the cliche &quot;One More Time&quot; (I say cliche because that's what nearly everyone heard first from Daft Punk's new album), when I saw it on a commercial for MTV2.  When I finally saw the video I was enchanted by the music and the video; I had to have more.  I bought the CD and have been dilligently searching for the other videos and I found that Daft Punk currently has at least 4 videos out from his new album, the first four songs of the album, all sections of a story that I find to be captivating, and greatly unfinished, so hopefully they'll get a video out for each track (they each deserve one).  The CD is AWESOME, all sorts of music, from generic pop to house music that will literally make you get up and dance to industrial sounding melodic techno, and not too much of anything.  As many of the other reviewers have said, this does have a very 80's feel to it, but I (a teenager) have been exposed to the best of both worlds (80's and modern music) and I personally find &quot;Discovery&quot; to be a VERY superb mix of both.  It's so refreshing to have house music with such good vocals, and the squealing guitar tracks are welcomed breaks from the smooth but hard dance tracks.<br />I've even heard Daft Punk's older stuff, including Stardust and &quot;Homework&quot;, and I personally think this is a redone band that everyone should listen to.  I guarantee that if you've found this album through references to other bands or &quot;customers who bought this also bought...&quot; then you will not be disappointed, in fact you will love this album.  Definitely my best buy here on Amazon.com
0671799320|4.0|The 20th Century was truly dominated by the advent of internal combustion and daniel yergin's classic is a fantastic study of how and why this occurred.  From its meager, uesless beginnings to the oil boom of the 1980s, oil has been the catalyst for a lot more of history than most would think.  Here it is all laid bare.<br />The story of oil and the engine make possible the influx of new and faster wepaons of war in the two world wars, and made its availability a critical strategic goal from then on.  Yergin's account of the huge importnace oil had on the wars and Cold War geopolitics is incredibly obvious in hindsight, but the information here is presented in a clear, insightful manner.<br />I use this book each year to explain to my classes the how and why of 20th century diplomacy and goals.  And each year, they find it easy to learn thanks to The Prize.
B00004R99M|5.0|&quot;It's as wonderful now as I remember it.&quot; Visual effects add to the story. Even though it is technologically dated, it doesn't matter. Teaches kids key lessons in a humorous way. &quot;I hope we never get too old or too sophisticated to enjoy a family gem like this.&quot; Enjoyed it and wanted to watch it again...&quot;over and over.&quot; Liked learning the lessons. &quot;You have to take the good with the bad...a spoonful of sugar helps.&quot; &quot;It's gonna be one of my favorites.&quot; &quot;It was supercalifragilistic...&quot; Ages 5-8, but good for all ages.
B000002BVN|2.0|i know mike can do better than this.
0553573403|5.0|I really like this book.  The story is very involved (that is good) and well thought out.  The multitude of characters have great interaction.  I usually do not buy any book of less than 700 pages and with at least 2 sequels.  I have not been disappointed with this book.  I am currently reading the sequel.
6304288433|2.0|Don't get me wrong, on a technical standpoint, Halloween 2 is a very well-crafted film. Rick knows his technics and knows how to deliver a &quot;solid&quot; film. But does he know about the art and &quot;incredients&quot; and &quot;know-how&quot; for crafting a sucessful slasher-film in the wake of one of the most sucessful Horror films ever made? The answer is, not quit. While Rosenthal has the gift of giving his films a rather nasty-repellent atmosphere (though not enough to turn you off) perfectly fitting the tone, that of the orginal. He doesn't seem to know how in the hell Carpenter made the original &quot;Halloween&quot;(1978) work in the first place. Then again, most people don't. With the sole excepton of Alfred Hitchcock. It also must be brought to attention that Carpenter's main infulence for Halloween was Dario Argento's DEEP RED(1975)...(happy Phil?!) Most of the plot thematics were borrowed, if not some of the situations, such as the scene where the police find a school where Michael Myers broke into only a few hours ago. Making the connection with Micahel Myer's sister as the camer looks upon a knife inbeded on a paper with a child-like drawing that Michael Myers drew himself...flashing back to the scene in Deep Red, when they make the killer's connection with the &quot;House&quot;. (You Have to see Deep Red, otherwise your probably lost) I might as well say here, I really have no intetion of really dwelling into this film, perhaps a future review of mine might uncover it further, but right now, Im lazy and I need to do my homework.....<br />Rating: 2 1/2 out of 5<br />Grade: C 80%
B00004R99I|5.0|Excellent production with beautiful animation. Good depiction of the fight against cultural bias. Portrays strong values regarding the importance of friendship.

B000001EHS|5.0|This is quite a good album which contains some of their best songs from the High 'n Dry through Retro Active era. It is a bit heavy on material from Hysteria, with all five of the successful singles from that album on Vault, but otherwise offers a good mix of material.
B00000JHAU|4.0|I was late to discover B&amp;S (early 2001), but quickly realized their brilliance.  I find their music intelligent, thoughtful and quite catchy with very clever lyrics.  The songs often sneak up on you. You listen to them once or twice and think, 'Yeah, that's a nice song.' Then you realize you want to hear them again.  And again. Then you say to yourself, 'God, these guys are fantastic!'<br />I am a huge fan of the Smiths and never thought I would like a band as much as I like them. I'm not trying to compare the two musically, but if you had a Smiths obsession in the 80s/90s you can understand the feeling one gets when you connect with a band in a special way. B&amp;S are the second band I got that feeling about.
0060934913|5.0|This book one of the most enjoyable books I have read in years.  Not only did it capture the edgy lifestyle I remember from restaurant work during my student years, but it is extremely funny.  Even if you have never worked in a restaurant, if you have ever eaten in a restaurant you owe it to yourself to read this book.  My husband and I have very different tastes in books, but we both laughed out loud and wound up reading chapters to each other out of this one!
B000002JS6|5.0|If you want a CD full of rockin' tunes about girls and booze, get this!  Top lyrics, great solos and just an overall crunching geetar fest that is very humourous and never gets old!
B000001Y9I|5.0|I have been a Deep Purple fanatic since 1972 with the releases of &quot;Machine Head&quot; and &quot;Made In Japan.&quot; I have seen them in concert twice, once with Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Gillan and once with Tommy Bolin and David Coverdale (@ Radio City Music Hall, of all places.) I guess I am telling you all this in order to share my credentials. I'm journalist, collector, musician and rock trivia buff. And I know a thing or two about this band.<BR>I have always felt (and still do) that Deep Purple was and still is one of the greatest rock bands ever, and the fact they aren't in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame is scandalous at best. They have had a career that has spanned five decades and produced some of the genre's most classic songs, both enduring and endearing.That's why I am absolutely over the moon about this album. In my mind, &quot;Purpendicular&quot; the best thing they've done since &quot;Burn,&quot; and the best Gillan-led set since &quot;Who Do We Think We Are!&quot;<BR>You have to give Ritchie Blackmore credit. He always knows when to leave. (He did it first in 1975, only to be replaced by Tommy Bolin - which resulted in &quot;Come Taste The Band,&quot; again, one of the best outings in the DP canon.) I thought the wholly forgettable albums the band released with Blackmore at the helm in the late '80s and early '90s would surely be the death knell for this once great ensemble. But off went Ritchie once again - in the middle of a tour no less - and the band was left to ponder its future. Deep Purple soon discovered its future in the elegant, yet incendiary acrobatic guitar riffs of Steve Morse - late of the rock/jazz fusion band Dixie Dreggs. (Weirdly enough, Morse also slummed briefly in a tenure with Kansas.)<BR>While Morse's style is obviously different than Blackmore's, the album remains distinctly Deep Purple in both sound and attitude. (Morse is more fluid and improvisational, while Blackmore's influences come largely from classical music, giving his solos are more rigid, rehearsed sound ... not that they weren't blistering and, at times, breathtaking - ie. &quot;Highway Star.&quot;)<BR>The CD kicks off with the catchy and amusing &quot;Ted the Mechanic&quot; - a crunchy, rollicking song that owes a nod to some of the hair band metal from the '80s. The third track, &quot;Soon Forgotten,&quot; is one of the oddest, most disturbing songs I've heard in a while. It's not the lyrical content that does it (it hardly ever is with Purple!), but it's the odd syncopation of the guitar and keyboard and Gillan's strange intonation as he sings. I hear a touch of Black Sabbath here.<BR>One personal favorite track from &quot;Purpendicular&quot; is the shimmering &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming.&quot; It opens with some beautiful acoustic guitar picking (and yeah, when was the last time you heard an acoustic guitar on a Deep Purple song? Huh? Huh? I thought so! This is yet another dimension Morse brings to the band!) Ian Gillan's restrained, lilting vocal passage soon gives way to a head-on crash chorus that is highlighted by a gorgeous Steve Morse guitar signature that gets repeated throughout the song. Though I can't even imagine Blackmore coming up with something like this, the song remains undeniably Deep Purple.<BR>Much has been mention in these reviews about &quot;The Aviator,&quot; another song with not only acoustic guitar, but mandolin as well. It's catchy, touching, has lyrics one can actually understand and sing along to - and you'll want to - and a big fat accessible chorus. Gillan does an impressive Ian Anderson impersonation here and the whole thing smacks of early Jethro Tull with a twist. It's really cool... a delight!<BR>&quot;Rosa's Cantina's&quot; - another highlight - is a thundering bluesy shuffle feature Gillan blowing some smokin' harmonica. Deep Purple you can dance to? Sure, why not!? It's down and dirty and just waiting for you to join in.<BR>Deep Purple's lead vocalists (all three) havenever been noted for their lyric-writing ability, but Gillan takes it up a notch on several outings here, most notably &quot;A Castle Full of Rascals,&quot; a scathing attack on politicians, corporate execs and other fat cats. Nice to see the boys write about something else other than hookers and fast cars, eh?<BR>Finally, there is a hidden track at the end of the CD... so let it play out. It's called (I think), &quot;Don't Hold Your Breath,&quot; and ironically is one of the best tunes on the record. It's a fun, rockin' rave-up with a great catchy chorus that would have no trouble finding radio airtime as long as it was during an era when the airwaves weren't being marketed toward 8-year old girls and 14-year old boys. (I bet it would sound awesome live, as well.)<BR>Overall, the band has never sounded as tight or as fresh as they do on &quot;Purpendicular.&quot; I believe the addition of Morse re-vitalized Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Roger Glover and Gillan. In fact, Gillan sings with maturity, restraint and nuance throughout the album. His screaming gymnastics are kept to a minimum, thus making them more interesting (and apropos) when they do appear.<BR>If you are a true Deep Purple fan, you are gonna love this record. If you are fan of hard, guitar-based rock, you are gonna love this record. If you've been away from Deep Purple for a while because you haven't liked what they'd been doing of late - you are in a for a big treat!<BR>It's good to know that these guys at my age are stilling doing as good, if not better, then they were 30 years ago. If that's not something to smile about, I don't know what is!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|IF THIS ISNT THE FINEST EXAMPLE OF THE CRAFT OF SONG WRITING I DONT KNOW WHAT IS!!!!! THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!! THANK YOU BOB FOR NOT GIVING UP ON US DURING THIS TIME OF MUSICAL NOTHINGNESS THAT IS DOMINATING THE RADIO.......I HOPE YOU GET AIRPLAY BECAUSE THIS IS STUNNING!!!!!
B00003CXN4|3.0|Make no mistake - whatever you've heard about Traffic - this a very well-made movie. It has good directing (Oscar), good editing (Oscar), good acting (Oscar) and solid script (Oscar). Overall, you can sense the smell of quality written all over.<BR>Some of the critics (and previous reviwers) compared this one to be 2000' L.A.Confidential. Well... Everyone and his opinion.<BR>I'll try to explain mine. This movie tells you in edgy manner three stories connected to drug business, quite succesfully weaving them together. I won't discuss the plot, because everyone else on this site already've done this.<BR>There's nothing truly shoking or original you haven't seen actually - it covers the same territory as other &quot;drug&quot; (and also very good) movies. But it also can't be original - it's adapted from the British mini-serial Traffik. And according to the &quot;misterious&quot; internet rumours- from the superior one.<BR>But that's not my problem with this film. Originality is a very rare quality (and not only in Hollywood!) but i happened to notice - also a very overrated one. What actually important to a viewer at home is not the novelty of the plot. It's the acceptability of the story and the way you tell it.<BR>L.A.Confidential has the story about people, not about 50's LA corrupted police department.<BR>Traffic tells us about drugs, not about people  - just as every Evening News programm on TV (just not in the very fresh mode). I doubt you'll watch tomorrow today's news - it'll be outdated.
B00005NW02|4.0|Im a punk rock fan with a distaste for ...-rock metal bands, and dumb rave pants wearing limp bizket fans. Usually i despise anything catogorized as metal, until i heard System of a Down's new release. HOLY ..., this is great music. It is agressive, but not just screaming, its poignant, but not trying to be over-intellectual. I think that SOAD is much better than any \\"metal\\" band ive ever heard, and i throw them right in the mix with AFI and Cigar as hard rockin' music that means something.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I, like many others who purchased this album, did so because we all read or heard somewhere that this is one of Radiohead's favorite groups. And how I am glad to be a simple-minded lemming!<BR>Why? Because this album is unlike anything i've ever heard, yet stays connected enough to bands like Radiohead, Aphex Twin?, and some unexpected blues to keep it a strong album. This is one of those albums that at first listen, you have a look of confusion, yet a determination to listen to all of it (70 min), then your eyebrows rise happily, then the jaw drops (a little over-dramatic, but it does), and then your curtain-like cheeks rise to reveal your safistied smile. You love the cd.<br />Besides, they're not American, so of course it's going to be great.
6305363668|5.0|I accept that this movie may be considered a little strange to the average viewer; with its hood of constant darkness and seedy LA underbelly, with it's strange mix of film noir and science fiction. Certainly, it is a strange film, but one that is hugely meritous for it's somewhat apocalyptic vision of the capitalist future within the context of a city of fallen angels, and the manner in which it explores the concerns of the age and humanity's fall from grace. Does being human give us all the attributes of humanity, for example, compassion? Do we need to be on the edge of death before we can appreciate life?<br />This version leaves many questions unanswered, and though I have not seen any version but the Director's Cut, I cannot imagine 'Bladerunner' with a positive outcome. It seems to defeat the entire purpose of the text, and the loss of the most important and beautiful line of the piece (as I see it) 'Its a shame she won't live, but then who does?' would affect the entire concept. A piece were life was present (like the original work) seems almost contridictory to the hopeless, loveless and careless setting of the work. Deckard as a non replicant (he is a replicant-how else would Gaff know his unicorn dream unless they were programed..) would also destroy the entire meaning of the work.<br />It is truly a fabulous work if one really considers the concerns of the director, and how his view of the future and critism of the present world and growing capitalisation is considered.
B00004XPP0|5.0|This isn't Sammy, actually it's his wife jen.  my husband loves these movies, but not quite to the extent i do.  he saw them for the first time he can remember when we first got together four years ago. i grew up on this stuff.  i'm only twenty, so i don't remember going to either of these films at the theater, but i don't think it really mattered.  they are just as big on the old tv, but i must say when my younger brother and i went to the new release of the Star Wars special edition, it was amazing.  these movies to me are just perfect.  they are not comparable to any other movies ever made, or any to ever be made.  there is everything you could ever want in these films and nothing is ever over done.  nothing cheesy, no corny jokes and nothing overexaggerated.  there is happiness, victory and sorrow but not so much that you can't relate to what's going on and how everyone is feeling. i hope no one ever sins and redoes these films. there is nothing that could ever make better what has been made, there are no actors that could ever suffice for the roles (if for some reason you would be reading this, i love you mark hamill; and episode I took awhile to get used to without the dashing trio-quartet, sorry chewie).<BR>to anyone who has yet to experience these films, they really should.  they display everything fantastic about film making, everything entertaining that has been lost over the past few decades in the film industry.  bravo to all who participated in this creation, it will be remembered and cherished forever. <BR>and for all you teens who just won't submit, kevin smith refers to Star Wars religiously in clerks, mallrats and there's that new jay and silent bob strike back movie.  it can't be that bad, now can it?

0553106635|5.0|Storm of Swords is the BEST BOOK I ever read. There. I said it. I got my book in Sept 2000 (yay for the quick deliveries in Holland), curled up in my favorite spot on the couch and began to read. I believe we had visitors that fateful weekend, but I don't think I paid much attention to them. Storm of Swords grabbed me at the throat and wouldn't let go until I finished it.<BR>Of course, it started off awesome already - Jaime, someone I felt highly fascinated by, got himself a POV. Yay!<br />Good, now for the review. This book has teared emotions out of me beyond anything I've ever read. I've been seen chuckling, laughing, choking, and at somepoint downright crying over what happened. When I finished Storm of Swords, I was high on adrenaline and out of breath.<br />Everything seems to come together what has been building in the past two books. About everything just explodes in your face. All the intruiges, everything. Some thing were to be expected, other's were most definately not. Want to know who killed Jon Arryn? Want to know how the Wall withstands it's first war? Want to know how long that brat Joffrey remains King of Westeros? Just read. It's more than worth it.<br />Some people complain about the grimness of the books, and the bloodbath of Storm of Swords (hey, the next book isnt called 'A Feast For Crows' for nothing ;)) was, but on the other hand, the dominating negativity makes the positive happenings so more brilliant and intense. Especially Arya's revenge was wonderful, also because you're really rooting for her, and you *really* don't know whether she'll survive or not.<BR>In other fantasy series, the main hero always lives. In WOT, for example, no one is dead until he's been vaporised by balefire.  And even then you're not certain he's been hit. That gets old soon. In ASOIAF, you're gnawing your nails over a simple brawl fight in an inn.<br />And that's the magic of Martin's work.<BR>A Storm of Swords is his best book yet, and I'm eagerly awaiting more.Eagerly? Frantically would be a better word I think.

B000002U9W|1.0|Atom Heart Mother is a lot like Meddle, with one long &quot;composition&quot; on one side (of the original LP) and a handful of lame &quot;songs&quot; on the other side.  Meddle is at least interesting.  AHM is just awful, disorganized and aimless.  The songs are totally forgettable.  The side-long title track was orchestrated and constructed by Ron Geesin, so think again before you go pronouncing Atom Heart Mother the ultimate Pink Floyd album.  It's a good thing an LP side only holds 20-30 minutes of music; who knows how much longer &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; (the suite) would have been if made in the digital/CD era.  The band disavowed the whole thing about 2 seconds after they finished it.  The album cover is wonderful, though.  For completists only.

The bright animation and colorful characters keep the story swinging and full of life. Differences are set aside to help each other. Our kids danced and sang at the end with comments such as: &quot;I love this movie!&quot; &quot;I love cats!&quot; &quot;I want to be a cat!&quot; They completely identified with the characters and teamwork and noted: &quot;It teaches you how to be good to people.&quot; &quot;The dogs teased each other like I do my friends.

0446608955|4.0|I have already read a few of Nicholas Sparks books and because I enjoyed them,  I decided to pick up &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;.  I didn't really know what to expect, however most of the way through I figured out that Sparks seems to have a knack for the romantic, yet tragic love story. <br />     This begins with an older man recalling a year of his life that he will never forget.  Basically, Landon Carter is the typical senior in high school.  He is applying to college and trying to figure out a way to cruise through the year.  Also, he is the typical teenager who is worried about his appearance in front of his friends.  Somehow, Landon befriends Jamie Sullivan who is the daughter of the town's Baptist minister and a conservative Christian girl.  Through the course of the school year, they fall in love as we get to know more about Landon and Jamie and see how these opposites attract.  Jamie changes Landon's life forever and he is never the same person.  If I say anymore about the plot, I will totally give it away and then you won't need to read it....so that's all I can tell you about the story.<br />     This book was refreshing because it was truly romantic because Jamie and Landon only share a few kisses and hand holding.  I am very used to any romantic book somehow culminating in some sexual activity, but this book was even better because it didn't.  <br />     It would make it a great book for a teenager for many reasons.  The great morals in respect to showing &quot;love&quot;, the fact that everyone has something to offer even if they are different and showing what some of the important things are in life.<br />     I would definately recommend reading this book, but I still think that even if you don't enjoy this one, check out some of Sparks' other novels for more tragic love stories!
B00005O3VC|5.0|Whenever I watch this masterpiece comedy I come as close as anyone can to pee and cry of laughter, I always cried, the first time i peed. This movie is so hilarious, I can't even tell you a scene that was the best, they all are classics.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I once asked my mother, who's a recovering alcoholic, why people become problem drinkers. She told me that there's no easy answer to that question, that the reasons are as numerous as the people who drink. That simple response told me more about the complexities of alcoholism than any ten books could have.<br />It's this objective, non-judgmental look at the drug problem that makes &quot;Traffic&quot; a superior film, and an excellent example of how to make a movie about a social or political issue without preaching. Rather than supply us with pat answers or preachy solutions, accompanied by a soupy Hollywood score, director Steven Soderbergh simply presents the problem as it is, and lets us take it from there.<br />Many other recent films about social or political issues have been notable as bully pulpits for their makers' political views. &quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; &quot;The American President,&quot; &quot;Bulworth,&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia&quot; all come to mind, and while none are bad films per se, the political/social commentary in each becomes tiresome. <br />However, after watching &quot;Traffic,&quot; I defy you to tell me where Soderbergh stands politically on this issue.<br />It doesn't hurt that &quot;Traffic&quot; is also one well-made, well-acted film, with great characters. <br />In particular, Benecio Del Toro stands out as an honest Mexican policeman trying his best to save his town from drug dealers, with the overwhelming corruption of the Mexican justice system fighting him every step of the way. <br />In America, the corrpution is less obvious, but it's there. Newly appointed national drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) talks tough on drugs publicly, but his own daughter (Erika Christensen) is addicted to crack. Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a upper-crust socialite living the good life in San Diego, and she has no idea that her lifestyle is bought by drug dealing. Two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) are hell-benton busting Ayala's drug dealing husband, knowing full well it won't make a bit of difference in the long run.<br />If drugs have caused overt corruption in Mexico, the corruption they've caused in our country is far more insidious and tougher to fix. &quot;Traffic&quot; brings this point out in standout fashion.<br />&quot;Traffic&quot; is powerful stuff, and its power comes largely from its absolute refusal to give the audience easy answers. If nothing else, the realization that there's no pat answer to the drug problem - such as declaring &quot;war&quot; on it - will do anything to solve it may just be the key to really ending it.
1559409010|5.0|This movie is just smart, genious, and oustanding! From classic scenes like the Crucifixtion, HAHAHAHAHAHA, so freakin funny, to  everything else in this movie. This and the Holy Grail are some of the greatest comedies of all time, if not the greatest movies.
B00003CXRP|3.0|&quot;Cast Away&quot; is, if nothing else, an example of how one great performance can almost lift a so-so film. In this case, the great performance is turned in by Tom Hanks, and it's a dandy. <br />Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express employee who's obsessed with time. We inhabit Noland's go-go world for a time, starting with one terrific sequence in which he's trying to sell Russians on the virtues of being on time - no mean feat with Russians. <br />We meet his girlfriend (Helen Hunt), a sweet woman who has to compete with Noland's job for affection (she gives him a conductor's pocket watch for Christmas, and he says he'll always keep it on home time).<br />All of this changes when Noland hops a Federal Express plane for a business trip to the South Pacific. The flight gets lost, then the plane is forced to ditch in the Pacific. After fighting to escape the burning, sinking plane, and struggling to survive in typhoon-racked seas, Noland finds himself stranded on a deserted, hardscrapple island. He instinctively reaches for his pager...and it's dead.<br />Suddenly, the man who is ruled by the clock has nothing but time. Hanks' transformation from helpless castaway to hardened survivor (and back to a civilized man after he's rescued) is alternately funny, sad, triumphant, and downbeat. He can say more with a facial expression, or body movement, than most actors can with brilliant dialogue.<br />The sequences in which Hanks tries to survive on the desert island are by far the strongest pieces of &quot;Cast Away,&quot; and taken alone, they're brilliant. Unfortunately, the bookends of the castaway story - the time before Noland is stranded and after he is rescued - don't even begin to approach the power of the island sequences. <br />For starters, once Noland's rescued, he wants above all to see his old girlfriend; unfortunately, in the intervening years, she has written him off for dead (as she should have), and she's married with kids. Director Robert Zemeckis - no stranger to schmaltzy relationships - toys with the audience briefly by suggesting they might get back together, but the mere idea of it is beyond silly, and thankfully, it's never consummated. The two characters are not the same two people who existed before Nolan was lost, after all. <br />But the mere idea of these two reuniting is so silly to begin with that Zemeckis is foolish for even entertaining it. Better to have cut that one off at the root, and had Noland start his journey of rediscovery. I also wish that Hunt would have been given more of a character to work with; she's basically stuck in a &quot;loving housewife&quot; mode, but we don't know what makes her tick, and I didn't see many sparks between her and Hanks.<br />Like all Zemeckis' movies, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is technically brilliant, but the island sequences challenge Zemeckis' usual hyperactive visual style; after all, how do you do &quot;Back To The Future&quot; camera moves on a desert island? Zemeckis compensates by adding other sensory stimulation - namely, sound - to the largely static camera shots to give us a kinetic sense of place. <br />Overall, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is very much worth seeing, if for nothing else than Hanks' brilliant performance and the raw power of the desert island scenes. It's too bad that these pieces didn't make a better whole.
630027120X|5.0|The basic theme for The Mission is the willingness to do what's right in the face of oppression and is universal in its meaning.  The Los Carlos mission lays in the area of South America that is disputed by the nations of Spain and Portugal, which for the most part, Spain owns.  However, Spain sells portions of their land claims to Portugal.  The importance of this upon the Spanish missions is that Portugal allows the slavery of the natives they find living in the Amazonian jungle while Spain did not openly condone slavery.  Two Jesuit Priests, portrayed by Jeffrey Irons and Robert De Niro, fight to keep the mission from falling into enemy hands, Mendez with both the sword and mouth, and eventually die for their causes.  Also added to the movie is the theme of repentance and forgiveness.  Mendez returned home from one of his slave hunts to find his lover betrayed.  In a moment of anger he stabs and kills his brother in the town square, and goes into a 6-month retreat at on the churches.  Although forgiven of his sins, Mendez chooses to climb the falls to Los Carlos carrying the old tools of his trade, where, remarkable, he is forgiven by the natives for the crimes he had committed against them.<BR> <BR>Father Gabriel, Jeffrey Irons, is a dedicated and caring Jesuit priest determined to save the people of his mission through purely diplomatic and spiritual means.  He is able to gain their trust by playing his oboe, a brave feat in light of the crucifixion of an earlier priest, and thinks, \\"If I had an orchestra, I could have subdued the entire continent.\\"  He is more orderly than his brethren Father Mendez, in that he won't publicly defy the court system sanctioned to govern over these affairs.  Father Mendez, contrary to Father Gabriel, is willing to attack the system that presides over this issue and is more overt in action.  When faced with the fact that the mission would be handed over to the Portuguese, Father Mendez renounces his priesthood and takes up arms asthe warrior he once was.  Both priests are alike in the caring for the natives and their beliefs that the natives deserve the same freedoms under God that they themselves have.  Father Mendez is just more willing, perhaps because of his background, to take arms to defend his cause.<BR> <BR>I am both deeply troubled and moved by the ending of this movie.  This film's score is amazing in portraying the emotions of these last scenes and scenes themselves are works of art.  The judge perhaps summed it up best saying \\"he wondered if they [the natives] truly wished that they [the white men] had never come in contact with them.\\"  In any event, I will never forget the ending of this film--Jeffrey Irons leading the women and children in prayer while they are being shot down as if for sport.  This film really touched, as, if it weren't for a phone call right at the end of the movie, I may very well have started to cry.  That's not something I can say about any other movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
0380817683|5.0|I loved this book as much, if not more than &quot;Watermelon&quot;.  It is a funny, poignant and emotional story of a young woman's battle with drug and alcohol abuse.  It does not describe the seemier, down-in-the-gutter aspects of drug addiction that you may expect, but what can happen when &quot;social&quot; use of cocaine and other narcotics can quickly go out of control.  One minute you want to shake Rachel for her denial and then you want to hug her and take care of her because she is a genuinely good person who simply can't help herself.<br />I find Marian Keyes writing style to be so very readable and look forward to her new novel.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|I don't think that L&amp;T can really be compared with all time Dylan Masterpieces like &quot;Highway 61&quot; or &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, but nevertheless its a good album. 4 songs will stay in your memory: &quot;Mississippi&quot;, &quot;Highwater&quot;, &quot;Po' Boy&quot;, and &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;.
B000002B2T|3.0|This was supposed to be a collaboration between Layne Staley (Alice In Chains) and Mike McCready (Pearl Jam) after they got out of rehab; hence a sober recording. Yeah right. This whole cd sounds like an extended acid trip. For the most part, this cd is pretty good and a departure from both the Alice In Chains and Pearl Jam styles. Much like Chris Cornell in Temple Of The Dog, Layne Staley shows the world that he does really have a beautiful voice when he wants to really sing.<br />The most recognizable song here is 'River Of Deceit'. It's radio airplay is justified with its toned down, relaxed, almost acoustic feel to it. The album opener 'Wake Up' is a brilliant song both musically and vocally. It's bellowing bass and subtle guitar combined with Layne Staley's stunning vocals, make this track one of the stars of this disc. 'Lifeless Dead' has an almost arena-rock feel to it, Layne Staley's voice turning what was almost a rocker into another melancholy dirge.<br />Another great song on here is 'I'm Above'. It has a catchy vocal and hard beat without losing the melancholy feeling to it. 'X-Ray Mind' also proves to be a great song, but one of the quirkiest songs is 'Long Gone Day'. Imagine Fastball's 'The Way' if those three guys were strung out on smack. I've never heard a song like this one before, and it's really kind of groovy.<br />This cd showed a lot of promise for a band that was getting together as a therapy of sorts for these veterans of self indulgence and addiction. However, it lacks the punch that I would have hoped for, save a few stellar tracks. Some of the lyrics could have used a little further development, lacking the same amount of introspection that a typical Alice In Chains disc would have and some of the riffs seem like they could have used a little more work as well. It is apparent from this disc that Stone Gossard really is the main riff writer in Pearl Jam. Mike may be a guitar guru, but a great songwriter; he is not.<br />I still recommend buying this disc, especially if you are a hardcore AIC fan like I, or if you love Pearl Jam. It is a good disc, not great, but good.
B00005NW02|5.0|Personally, I think this album is far better than System of a Down's self-titled debut.  This one is more musical, with time changes, dynamics, and melodies outside of downtuned power chords.  Also, this one is not as redundant as the first.  The songs are all pretty much death-metal mania, but each one has a different touch to it.  If you are new to this band, I would reccomend the first album because it's a little easier to digest and get in to.  If you are a seasoned veteran and you don't have this album, you should be ashamed.  Every song is simply amazing, filled with blistering guitars, machinegun drumming, sludging bass, and of course, Serj's signature vocal &quot;stylings&quot;.  The funny thing is that when he's actually singing, he is an amazing vocalist.  The best songs are &quot;Deer Dance&quot;, &quot;Needles&quot;, &quot;Jet Pilot&quot;, and of course, the epic &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;
B000001DV2|5.0|If you didn't think Def Leppard could clean up their act any more with Hysteria, you need to listen to Adrenalize.  This CD takes what made them popular on Hysteria and cleans it up.  Adrenalize is like the cut and polished diamond that was Hysteria.  Everything on this CD has energy and refinement.  Almost to the point that you may think they just cranked out cookie cutter songs.  Not so though, they slaved on this work.  Doing things again and again until it was right, a tribute to the work ethic ingrained in them by Robert `Mutt' Lange.  The power and performance on this CD is downright Leppard and I believe it was the height of their creativity.  A place where they have never come down from though.  The progression of their talent on this CD shows their talent and ability are not a fluke.
0380788624|3.0|This book had the makings of a wonderful story for those of us who love computers, intrigue, codes, ciphers, and the humans behind them.  But what an ultimate disappointment.  Gosh, can we please advance beyond adolescent male fantasies and gonzo journalism?  The situations themselves, real or imagined, are fascinating enough, but are unfortunately diminished by the aren't-I-clever quips, which are rarely funny and usually irritating.  I hear similar language from teenagers who are attempting to define themselves with their &quot;toughness.&quot;  It is unbecoming and frankly embarassing to hear it again from a writer of this magnitude.  If the author could just rely upon his considerable skills to tell the story without resorting to Kool Kommentary, this would have been a superior novel.  As it is, this style tells us why geeks remain geeks: when alienated, it is easier to wallow in the fantasy one's own sense of hipness than it is to figure out what really communicates to the rest of the human race.  All in all, I would have loved to have seen this considerable talent focus more on telling the story and less on feeding the ego.  Intelligence is sexy enough.
B000001FKY|5.0|With Hysteria, Def Leppard polished their sensibilities and kicked into high gear.  A little more pop sounding but definitely more mature and developed, It's easy to see why Hysteria was their best selling album.  It took one song `Pour Some Sugar on Me' to really get it off the ground but there is so much more gold on this album.  Women, Rocket, Animal, Hysteria, Armageddon It, Gods of War, everything on this CD is awesome.  Personally, I think they just got even better after this, but if you want to even begin to like Def Leppard, this is a really good place to start.

6305327041|1.0|Trees Lounge was the worst. That film had no redeeming value whatsoever. At the very least, I can say that the last ten seconds of Four Rooms (prior to the end credits) are amusing and memorable. On the whole, though, this is a wretched, loathsome attempt at entertainment and should be avoided if at all possible.<br />Four Rooms is a series of four short films chronicling one very unenviable night in the life of Ted the Bellhop (played by Tim Roth in one of the worst performances of his career). While each of these short films has a similar background, the director of each mini-feature is different, with Allison Anders (Gas Food Lodging), Alexandre Rockwell (In the Soup), Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Spy Kids), and Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) collectively directing the movie.<br />Originally I saw this in theaters the night after it was released, and I walked out in the middle of the third segment. Later I saw the rest of the film and was not impressed. More noteworthy, though, is how sickened I was by what I originally saw of this film. Lesbian witches exchanging inane and unamusing tripe dialogue, Tim Roth's face covered with someone else's vomit, young children jabbing hypodermic needles into each other, and Quentin Tarantino... and frankly, I'm not amused.<br />I have met people who found this movie humorous. To each his or her own, and so you may wish to consider renting this if you absolutely must have more independent films in your life. But I cannot recommend this horrid film to anyone under any circumstances.

B00003CWTI|3.0|This film centers around a number of seemingly-unrelated characters in seemingly-unrelated situations, yet every one of these characters' situations has something in common-- none of this film's characters are portrayed as containing any sort of redeeming value. The director and screenwriter would not have you believe that the characters here are evil, but Magnolia's perspective on humanity is very negative. <br />Throughout this ungodly long film you will see these characters in pain, in misery, in desparation, crying out but not being heard, needing help but not receiving it; and all the while, no rationality is given as to why we, the audience, might want to see so many miserable people in pain, suffering, even dying. The dialogue here, and the direction, is reminiscent of other films that have previously been hailed as thought-provoking films, and so many may mistake this as a thought-provoking film, speaking of its powerful message about society. But this film has no message. This film has no point. If this film has any point whatsoever, it is that one man can write a meaningless, dry, miserable story, and make it look intelligent through intelligent presentation; and for this he will receive critical acclaim, even Golden Globe awards, all because today's audiences are too stupid to realize when they're being mocked.<br />For Magnolia is a mockery. It mocks its characters, it mocks its audience, and it mocks other films that manage to entertain by providing a pleasant and/or complete resolution. I commend this film on its success, for it has managed to prove its point: film audiences and critics alike know nothing about storytelling, only about what they are expected to appreciate. But in the end, this is a miserable film, one that I cannot recommend to anyone.<br />For fans of the film, though, this DVD is an excellent package. Considering the film's length and the inclusion of more than one audio track, the quality of the transfer is very good, if not excellent (there is some artifacting at times). More importantly, though, a second disc is included which contains a number of interesting extras, including a seminar done by Tom Cruise while in character.
B000021YQV|5.0|i am in love with this cd.  at the moment it is all i am listening to.  diverse.  melodic.  ecclectic.  intensely intelligent.  i love every song on this. if i had to list my favorites... wow.  atwa.  shimmy.  aerials.  those are favorites of the moment.  i can honestly say that it has been years since i've had a cd that i can stand to listen to from start to finish... and love each song for it's own reasons (instead of the fact that they all sound like the first single and are catchy... so of course you like them for a week or two)  each song is an entity.  well, i'm babbling here.  great cd.  great band.  buy it.  if you have their older cd and thought it was too dense or too striving to be serious... this effort has shown that System Of A Down has grown as a band... it makes an equal impact upon you... with subtlety and melody.  beautiful cd.
B000002LVB|3.0|The Editorial review states that John Cale wasn't a part of this album, which is correct, but also states that Moe Tucker played drums, which is incorrect. (I think she left the group to have a baby, maybe?)  Moe has said in interviews that while she liked this album, it's not a Velvet's album.  There was some guy playing drums.  <br />Overall, a good pop album, and a good solo Lou Reed album, but not the Velvets, or a sub-standard velvets anyhow.  It's funny how the Replacements did the same thing on All Shook Down - cleaned up and made it less interesting, even though the songs were good pop, Paul Westerberg solo songs.
0553579908|5.0|George R.R. Martin is not content to just cruise thorugh the second part of his series like many other authors who deliver nothing but a running-in-place plot that only serve to lengthen their novels needlessly. No, Martin delivers and surpasses A Game of Thrones with much more warfare, treason, intrige, plot twists and an ever increasing magical element that adds spice to the proceedings. In this installment, everybody and his brother (literally) fights and schemes for the Iron Throne and any one of them could be King. The thing is, like in real life, we're never quite sure who we should be rooting for as there are no clear cut villians or heroes, only people behaving like people do, and that's what sets this series apart from the rest- its almost historical realism. Yes, there is magic, but it is subdued, which makes it more mysterious and deadly.<BR>Tyrion Lannister, Robb Stark, The Kingslayer, Cersei, Jon Snow, these and a multitude of other characters jump off the page with their own distinctive voices. Speaking of which, the book indeed has a LOT of characters, fortunately there's a listing of all of them at the end of the book to use a scorecard. All in all, not to be missed, very exciting stuff.
B00004TJFL|3.0|There is great debate over this film among the die hard fans. They either love it or hate it. It's a film that has definitley lost it's way, but makes up for it by being fun. Yes, I think it was quite fun. It's not near as bad as they would lead you to believe. Halloween 5 takes up where the more superior Halloween 4 left off a year earlier. Little niece Jamie now has a psychic bond with Michael. Loomis is back and uses Jamie's link to him to try and track him down. Okay, the psychic link thing was kinda stupid and a stretch for a plot but, strangely, it works. I don't know why.Danielle Harris as Jamie is one of the best young kid actors I've seen. Her performance here and in Part 4 are both very well done performances. She is real and very believeable. Plus, she's adorable. Donald Pleasance continues his roll as slightly demented Dr. Loomis, and you love watching every minute he's on screen. By this time, Loomis has gone a little mad himself. He is a determined man on a mission. He won't stop until Michael has been. It is Mr. Pleasance who is the center of these films. The heart and soul of them. Not Michael Myers. It's a huge disappointment that Ellie Cornell, who plays Rachel, has a smaller role. She's a beauty with good talent. To use her so little in this film was a mistake. She and the character of Rachel should've had more to do. The mask of Michael Myers is debatable. The forehead was too high and the hair too long. It was not a good mask. It looks nothing like the one in Part 4. Nothing happened to that mask, but it is quite different in this film. The film has really sharp choreography. It's one of the better looking films in the series. If you could only give one good credit to this film, it's that it looks darn good. The film definitley has the look and feel of October. That is very important in these movies.  The scene with Michael unmasking and shedding a tear was emotional. It showed that Michael isn't a zombie or a ghost. He is real flesh and blood. He just happens to kill people. Lots and lots of people!. Don Shanks is the stuntman to don the mask this time. He is a solid addition to the mask of Michael. If only the mask were as good as he was!. One of the things that this movie does with Michael that is bad is that they turn him into just another savage slasher like Jason. Michael doesn't rack up huge body counts with excessive blood and brutal slashings. It's not the character. That has changed thru out the series. This is one where he is in 'Jason' mode. And finally, the mystery man in black was a bizarre addition to the story. What point was there to this?. Do we, the audience, benefit from this?. No. Not in the least. It was a ridiculous attempt by the screenwriter to add another story. It doesn't work. Halloween 5 is by no means a classic. It's a routine slasher film, but it's got great entertainment and suspense. A worthy sequel. Part 4 is still much better. If you still don't agree, then you can tell yourself that at least it's still better than the very hated Halloween 6.He just happens to kill people. Lots and lots of people!.

6303921248|5.0|The BBC's 1996 version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the most wonderful film I have ever seen. I own two copies of the miniseries and I continue to watch the 6 hour length film nearly everyday. Of all of the film adaptations of Jane Austen's books I believe that this is the only one that relays Ms. Austen's true lessons and observations of character. The performances by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are astounding, to say the least. Their tremendous performances transport the viewer into the world of Jane Austen. If you aren't interested in the plot then watch it for its exquisite set design and costuming. If you desire to see the most remarkable, intelligent actors battling a war of the wits, then this movie is for you. If you love the subject of relationships and true love then you absolutely must watch this film. Lastly, if you are an Actor or other stage performer or musician then you absolutely must view this film at least once. For all of the reasons above, this film is good for almost all audiences. I highly recommend it and I hope that you view this film and purchase it. If you own one film then let it be this one. I have rarely before seen such an exquisite marriage of set design, costuming, acting, and music in a film.<BR>Please rent and/or buy this movie, you will not regret it.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dylan strikes again!  You all are probably very curious what Bob Dylan has been up too since we last heard from him in 1997 with the Grammy winning TIME OUT OF MIND, and I was fortunate enough to pick up a copy on September 7th, with the bonus disc of two tracks.  Don't worry, you all are in for a treat.  The bonus disc has a traditional folk song entitled &quot;I was Young When I Left Home,&quot; and has a running length of 5:24, and the other is an alternate version of &quot;The Times They Are A' Changin',&quot; and 2:57.  Both are remarkable.  But what about LOVE AND THEFT?  Well, I'll tell you.<br />Dylan's miracle working knows no stopping, and with this release, he single-handedly creates an homage to the blues and yet captures all the tensions therein this particular genre.  It's truly a greatest hits album, but not of Dylan, but rather the blues.  That is the central paradox of this album.  He has created a blues album which is simultaneously being torn in two directions, which epitomises the genre itself in the 1930s to the 1950s. <br />LOVE AND THEFT certainly marks its roots in the blues.  Just a little over half the album plays like the successor that this record is to the 1997's smash TIME OUT OF MIND in the sense that it feels really bluesy but without the death obsession that its predecessor had. The other half, (these five tracks: Summer Day, Bye and Bye, Floater, Moonlight, and Po' Boy) sound like they call come from the same synapses of Dylan's brain, as their sound blur into one another.  The best way to describe it is it sounds like old, simple bluesy folk compositions with a real 1930s to 1940s  feel too it.  Summer Day's intro reminds me of old 1950s rock, but then transform back into the similar feel of the aforementioned tracks.  On first listening thru these songs, I found myself wanting to skip them, but on second listen I became more impressed with the compositions.  It's as if Dylan wanted to make old scratchy records without the scratches from the Depression Era, and generally he is successful.  Although I never thought I would make this analogy, the track &quot;Moonlight&quot; reminds me of old Blue Eyes, Frank Sinatra.<br />Because this is the release immediately after TIME OUT OF MIND, an album that won Dylan critical praise and renewed interest, I feel I need to clarify LOVE AND THEFT's relationship to TIME OUT OF MIND.  TIME OUT OF MIND, which plays like a concept album about death and being in love with a woman he wishes he wasn't,  feels like BLOOD ON THE TRACKS aged twenty or so years, and an utter weariness permeates the proceedings.  (Taken in this context, &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot; stands as one of the most depressing and pained things Dylan ever wrote).  <br />And just like BLOOD ON THE TRACKS and DESIRE, TIME OUT OF MIND and LOVE AND THEFT are two completely different albums.  BLOOD and TOOM are very personal albums.  DESIRE has a weird world beat, and LOVE AND THEFT, although much closer to TOOM in its musical foundation (for both share blues as their central structure), loses the intimacy of TOOM, which creates yet another paradox, because TOOM has all the intimate factors that make Blues feel so personal to us, and yet LOVE AND THEFT loses that feeling of raw intimacy and yet it better captures the blues genre that TOOM does.  TOOM is personal application of Blues principles, where LOVE AND THEFT is more of a textbook study of the tensions of the blues genre. <br />LOVE AND THEFT keeps the same blues base, but ultimately TIME OUT OF MIND is ultimately the bluesier in the modern context of the two records because there is more of a cohesian of the pain and more commonly perceived blues elements.  Each song adds the pain felt in the previous song, making it like a snowball effect and culminating in the 16 minute closer &quot;Highlands&quot;.  Ironically, though, this record captures more of the blues tradition and the genre's myriad influences, although time may have obscured this.  This tension between those old scratchy folk sounding songs and the more commonly perceived bluesy material creates a tension that is not felt on TIME OUT OF MIND at all.  Side 1 (the first six songs), opens with two blues, then two of the other, then another one that's like TOOM, and then ends with &quot;Floater&quot;.  Side 2 is a similar story.  Dylan's sequencing proves absolutely essential on this release, for without it the tension would simply be lost.  A very notable composition is &quot;Highwater (for Charlie Patton)*,&quot; which sounds like a close relative of &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown,&quot; and straddles the fence quite appropriately between the blues and folk but with more emphasis on folk.  Because folk's influence on blues is never made more explicit in the context of this record than on here, &quot;Highwater&quot; stands as a very important link to the song cycle that is LOVE AND THEFT. <BR>  <BR>Dylan said of LOVE AND THEFT that the songs don't really have any genetic history, and that they're probably not like his previous works.  Dylan said he thought of it more like a greatest hits album, either Volume I or II.  There weren't any hits on this record -- at least, not YET.<br />Again, Dylan proves the most perceptive of his work.  Although LOVE AND THEFT's closest relation in Dylan's catalogue is TIME OUT OF MIND, it stands as a greatest hits record of blues' history and the struggle with in the genre to find its own sound, and yet these are all new songs created by Dylan in the new millennium.  That is the central paradox of LOVE AND THEFT, and what makes it so incredibly interesting.  <br />*If you have any information on him please email me.
0446677450|4.0|I couldn't put this book down and I read it in just two days. It is written in a easy to follow style and format. No prior knowledge base is required. The author is repetitive at times, but the fact that he is, I feel, just helps drive the points in this book home. Most people spend so much of their life finding reasons why they can't get ahead that most readers need a few extra pages of reassurance to help them believe that they can succeed. The book describes, in a laymen's fashion, how to ensure that you do not go through life doing nothing but acquiring liabilities, and describes the basic thought patterns of the rich and successful. This book shows, when it all comes down to it, being rich is just a state of mind. Because &quot;Rich Dad&quot; started explaining these principals to two nine year old boys, the concepts are not hard to follow. Basic cash flow diagrams are shown, and the definitions of an asset and a liability are explained. You may be surprised when Mr. Kiyosaki challenges the notion that your house is the biggest asset you have. In a country with an ever-growing gap between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot;, this book serves as accounting and investing 101, and as a way to make up for most peoples lack of financial education and training.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All is arguably Metallica's best recording. In my opinion, only Master Of Puppets comes close.<BR>The most amazing thing of this record is that not a single song is boring. The album's nine tracks make over an hour of Metallica, but there is no dull moment to be found on this record. The album's style is diverse, from the fast and furious Dyers Eve, to the slow and touching To Live Is To Die. One is perhaps Metallica's greatest song ever, slowly evolving from a slow guitar solo to the great and incredibly fast ending. The title track is one of the most complex numbers ever composed by Metallica, giving Lars and Kirk the possibility to display their exceptional skills. James' deep, growling voice fits in perfectly. I cannot imagine some else's voice singing these songs, James' voice is just perfect for this.<br />The skills the band members show on this album are incredible. Lars is almost machine-like when he gets behind his drums. Lars' drumming is often complex, sometimes very fast but always great. Just listen to the title track and concentrate on the drumming, it is just great. Kirk is definately one of the best metal guitarists. He sometimes leaves me completely awed with one of his solos. He too can play very fast, but if you listen to To Live Is To Die you'll see that slow doesn't have to mean boring.<BR>James' deep, growling voice has now fully matured . James also play's the guitar alongside with Kirk, sometimes he even performs a solo. Now you may have missed a mention of Jason, but that has a reason. The reason is that the production of this album is not, to put it mildly, very good. One of the side effects is that Jason's bass playing is hardly audible. Some people consider this to be an ode to Jason's deceased predecessor Cliff Burton, but I don't believe in that theory. <br />Lyrically this albums explores new heights, handling subjects ranging from the destruction of the earth (Blackend), abuse of power (the title track) to a ferocious rage about struggling with your parents (Dyers Eve). Metallica is one of those bands who not only produce excellent music, but whose lyrics are very much worth listening to. The lyrics really want to tell you something, the songs capture you through the lyrics.<br />I have owned this album for more than 5 months, but I still listen to it very frequently. For real metal fans this is a must have. Metallica fans who only know Load or ReLoad might give it a little hearing first. For the rest, go and buy it! You wont regret it!

630245333X|1.0|I saw this film because I was such a fan of the orignal version.  What a dissapointment.  This film goes heavy on the gross-out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes.  The original was much scarier because of what you didn't see.  The imagination is a powerful tool.  We can imagine much worse that what we see.  Just knowing the blob was somewhere, without actually seeing too much of it provided me with years of nightmares.  I own the DVD of the original and watch it at least six or seven times a year.  Matt Dillon was the flavor of the month when the remake came out.  His performance was less than remarkable.  An earlier review mentioned that Dillon was a much better choice of teen angst/rebellion than was Steve McQueen.  Interesting, where the hell has Dillon been since this abortion of a film?  McQueen is an icon and is still much more popular than Dillon.  McQueen is also dead.

We all go through life chasing after goals, longing to fix what's missing, obtaining things such as status and wealth, and yet we really never feel fulfilled.<br />What a gift Morrie Schwartz was not just to Mitch Albom, but to the world. His gift was &quot;living in the moment&quot;. Morrie states many times you can not make up for things that happened in past, you can only forgive what you believe either you did wrong or what was done wrong to you and be where you are right now. <br />He states at one point when his health is failing very badly that he is happier dying than most people are living.<br />This book is a must read.

B00005NZBN|5.0|First off: don't be put off by reviews which talk about the \\"old-fashioned\\" style of the songs. Most of them will sound good to anyone with even the slightest familiarity with American music from the 20's to the 50's. <br />The record is really good, and I'll give it the coveted fifth star on the grounds of indispensability (you've gotta get it because it's not like anything else he's done). But I'd have to say it only makes Bob's top 10, not his top 5; it's got only three or four great songs, and so loses out to \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", and \\"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3\\", and it doesn't have the cumulative emotional knockout punch of \\"Street-Legal\\" and \\"Time Out of Mind\\". <br />Rating the individual songs, I share the consensus that seems to have emerged. \\"High Water\\" is the best, a genuinely great track that recalls the other great tribute \\"Blind Wille McTell\\" (which is even better). \\"Sugar Baby\\" is also terrific and unforgettable, and \\"Mississippi\\" is the third 'A' song (of course a 'B' for Bob is an 'A' for anyone else). All three are beautiful, majestic, and deep.<br />'Moonlight' is a less substantial song, but perfectly written and performed, and more intricate than it sounds at first.  After many listens, I actually like it better than \\"Sugar Baby\\" and \\"Mississippi\\".<br />'Lonesome Day Blues' and 'Cry Awhile' are remarkably enjoyable blues numbers, very original, and the ones that repay repeated listens the most.  Probably the most \\"timeless\\" of the 12 tracks.  Bob's cracked and ruined voice fits them perfectly.  (It's not utterly destroyed -- when he wants to, as on \\"Moonlight\\", he can croon pretty well.)<br />The other songs are very good, but are lighter fare ('Summer Days', 'Bye and Bye'), or lyrically too weird ('Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee', 'Honest With Me'), or musically too grating ('Floater', \\"Po' Boy\\") to make the first rank. They're all full of treasure, though.<br />The two bonus tracks are terrific! 'I Was Young When I Left Home' is astonishingly mature, the equal of any song on the first \\"Bootleg Series 1-3\\" disc, and the version of \\"The Times, They Are A-Changing\\" is slower and more powerful than the standard version, despite the slight hiccup in the last verse that probably led to its rejection.<br />-- Joe Shipman

B00005NI5Y|5.0|[Upon] The release of Bob Dylan's 43rd album, 'Love and Theft', ...a smile came across my weary face as I realized Bob had done it yet again - AMAZED, STUNNED, and offered yet a little more light in such a dark world. <br />The morbid tones of the Grammy winning 'Time Out of Mind' are traded in for a much more playful Dylan. Joined by his crack touring band of the past 2 + years, as well veteran keyboardist (and previous Dylan collaborator) Augie Meyers, Dylan travels the back roads of American music. This is easily an album Dylan could have done at the beginnng of his career, when he was finding himself musically. Influences come from jazz, blues, bluegrass, country, swing, and, yes, ragtime. This is an album that cannot disappoint and gets better with each listen.<br />Lyrically, Dylan finds himself running into the likes of Romeo and Juliet, Othello & Desdemona, Charles Darwin, & Big Joe Turner, among others. His career long struggle with women is still very evident, but never quite as humorous (Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months / Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once). Sure ya didn't, Bob! ;>)<br />If you claim to have any love of music whatsoever, especially the roots of American music, get this album. Not, that he needed to any further, but Dylan has once again solidified himself as part of this history - and proven several times over why he is the greatest songwriter of all time.
B0000025C0|5.0|I have to disagree with the other reviewers.  This CD is better than the debut CD.  Yes, the first album was unique and defined what was almost a new genre in Rock music, so the second one can't possibly be unique.  But I think that the best song on &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; is better than the best song on &quot;Boston,&quot; and the second best... and so on.<br />Unfortunately, I think at the time they came out, the sound was so unique that a lot of people dismissed it with some variation of &quot;all their songs sound the same.&quot;  Unfortunate treatment for what I think is the best of Boston.

It goes beyond on the narration. <br /> - It`s not \\"Americana\\" on its spirit. Mr. Hanks and his team deserve merits for showing this great achievement as a mankind victory instead of an \\"America only\\" feat. Congratulations! <br /> - Each episode is presented thru an original point of view, not the one you`d expect. This gives new life to the facts. The Apollo 13 episode, for example, shows how an anchor man from a TV network faced his drama at the same time as the astronauts. A great achievement since if it was presented the other way it would fail when compared to the movie. Actually, one complements the other. <br /> - Many generations have not lived the man on the moon. This is the best way to give them a small feeling of what that meant. It`s the closest an historical document can get to emotion. Anyone will learn great and funny facts from the Apollo project and its missions. <br /> - Episodes are very successful in passing the feeling of this great achievement. You`ll be proud of it, specially if you happened to be alive when it happened. At the end you`ll regret the fact that today we (humans/nations) spend too much time and energy with small problems that don`t take anyone anywhere. <br /> - On the latest episode you`ll learn that one of the century`s \\"greatest\\" men was, actually, the first pirate whose actions screwed up the life of the first great filmmaker. <br /> - Mr. Hanks talents go far beyond acting. Congratulations! <br /> - Acting is amazing, direction perfect, screenplays compelling. You won`t believe this was \\"just\\" a 12 episode TV miniseries. It`s FAR better than many movies made on science fiction/space explorationgenres. <br /> The only point where they`ve sleeped: <br /> - The box and its opening \\"book\\" scheme doesn`t feel it`ll be up to date when man reaches Mars. <br /> I`d like to remind you all that this is not a science fiction miniseries. Its focus is on the spirit, the challenge, the emotions, the technology, the men and women involved on taking the man on a voyage from the Earth to the Moon. <br /> It`s not cheap. But worth every cent.
0671042858|2.0|I must admit that I enjoyed this book, but I was only able to do so because I suspended my belief in reality and accepted King's premise.  The little girl is lost early in the book, and from there I read each page wanting to find out if and when and how she would be rescued.  The rescue at the end would be the big payoff.  The girl Trisha spent several weeks in the woods, getting bitten to death by bugs, slowly going crazy, starving and sick, but somehow she keeps moving.  Her favorite baseball player is Tom Gordon, and she listens to his games on her Walkman and talks to him to try and keep her sanity.  All of this works well, and the end is a satisfying payoff to the girl lost in the woods story.<br />But was this good for a Stephen King effort?  Sure it was, but it wasn't worthy of a novel.  Even at large print and 220 pages, this short novel seemed to drag in places and to also be repititive.  This would have been better a short story part of a larger collection.  I think King could have done better than producing this afterthought of a novel.  Other recent novels are probably 4 times longer than this one.
B00005NZBN|5.0|I have only been a fan of Bob Dylan for a few months, but in that time I have listened to most of his albums through all the genres of music that he has covered, and it is my sincere belief that this album is one of his best ever.  <br />To start off with, he has described this album as being based on the 12-bar blues progression.  Basically this translates into many of the songs on this album having a distinctly blues sound.  While this may initially turn some people off from the album, I would advise giving it a shot.<br />It opens with Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum, a gambling song that reminds me of 'Lily, Rosemary, &amp; the Jack of Hearts.'  It's one of my favorites on the album.  Mississippi is standard Dylan.  That is, anyone who has listened to Dylan's more traditional songs (folk stuff, the Oh Mercy album) would not be surprised by the sound of the song.  It contains his usual lyrical quality, nice rhymes, and a catchy tune.  <br />Other highlights on the album are Po' Boy (available as a free download on bobdylan.com, Lonesome Day Blues (perhaps the best blues song I have ever heard in my life) and Sugar Baby, which contains a line or two that assures us that his Christian faith is still much intact.  Bye and Bye is a wonderful slow song.  It sounds like watching clouds.  Just listen to it.  You'll understand.<br />Overall, this is a great album.  Much like a lot of Dylan's work, you don't need to know, or even be a fan of, his other albums to like this one.  It's blues themes and lyrics add up to a wonderful album that deserves to be Album of the Year in any and all awards given each year.  Highly recommended.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Whenever I hear the name &quot;Billie Joe&quot; I get the image of the little singer guy who set fire to a drum kit last August at the Gig On The Green festival in Glasgow, Scotland. I seriously thought he was going to smoke the kickdrum!  <br />Basically, as for the album, it is superb, not many albums get me this hooked, but it really is perfection. Green Day once again, never fail to impress with, deep, meaningful, upbeat lyrics, a vast array of instruments. On this album alone, lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe plays the Mandolin, Saxaphone, Harmoinca and The Guitar. Credit is most definitly due to the guy. Be assured, Green Day cut no corners when releasing albums and it is this integrity, this perfectionism that I admire in the trio. Not to forget their instrumental talents, but Billie Joe is a great singer too. <br />Songs that stick out for me on this particular album have to be, the outstanding &quot;Jackass&quot; and the funny story of &quot;Blood, Sex And Booze&quot; (trust me, it is a comedy!) Singles are the immensly popular &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Minority&quot;.<br />My only one complaint (honestly, I've tried to find one, believe me.) Is that there should have been more singles off this album! but why spoil the album for people by releasing half of it as singles? As all the songs are superb, I can't see you getting disssapointed, so you've got nothing to lose. <br />Don't be A &quot;Basketcase&quot;, &quot;Nimrod&quot; or complete &quot;Jackass&quot;, just buy &quot;Warning!&quot;
B00003CX5P|5.0|i loved this movie and i can't wait until Christmas so I will get it!!
0440217563|5.0|It's unbelievable how Gabaldon is able to pack so much action and suspense into an 870 page novel.  How can she come up with it all?  How can she KEEP TRACK OF IT ALL?<br />The readers get to see Jamie and Claire find each other again (and I don't just mean physically) as they rush to track down and rescue their nephew.  Gabaldon introduces old and interesting characters from the first novel as well as bringing a few new interesting ones into the pot.<br />Over all, I found this novel remarkable and the best yet--and darn glad I'm finished so that I can finally have a decent night sleep!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Christopher Nolan has crafted an excellent modern film noir (a genre that is basically as dead as the western). The central performances are emotionally engaging and taut. Some have complained that this DVD is problematics because there's no commentary. If you watch the film closely and rewind when necessary, is commentary really needed? It might have been nice to hear what Nolan had to say, but I think this film speaks for itself.<br />Unfortunately this has come out on DVD now; it might have had a great shot at winner a best original screenplay Oscar, but being out on video reduces, if not completely elimates, the &quot;event&quot; value of such a picture.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I'm highly suspect of modern music. U2's latest was a yawn, so was Oasis'. and I know better than to buy a new REM cd. these acts haven't moved one space from their first records. Dylan's latest is raw to the bone and has soul in its marrow. his voice is ravaged and sounds like Howlin' Wolf on Sun records. the songs are great and stick in your head and heart long after listened to. Mississippi and Sugar Baby are deep, deep songs that crawl under your skin like leeches. Lonesome Road Blues hammers on for 6 relentless minutes that outrock anything done by overamped alt. bands. not to be overlooked is how refreshing it is to listen to a BAND at work. Dylan's outfit is a cohesive unit that really inhabits the songs. a rarity in modern music. you either have soulless comp chip rap or earsplitting alt bands screaming their phony &quot;rage&quot;. the only good musicians are found in Nashville and they're so concerned with keeping their audience of emotion starved 25 year old women that their songs have no edge. listen to Love and Theft for songs and a sound that's all but lost in music unless you go back at least 40 years. the best new record I've heard since Townes Van Zandt's No Deeper Blue. music for your bones.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This film is a terrible disappointment. It showcases all that is BAD with the dominance of the special effects film of the 90s. The story is absurd, the characters flat and hackneyed, as background to the previous triology it offers nothing new, the casting is uninspired and the villian is wasted. I won't even touch on the putrid Jar-jar Binks.<br />I think where this film went wrong is that Star Wars has become larger than George Lucas, it's become part of the public trust for pop entertainment. The fans almost own the property as much as LucasFilm. And it would have been difficult to create a sequel (prequel) that could ever live up to the height. Especially after 16 years.<br />Creatively it seems that Lucas has lost it (if he ever had it - witness the title of Episode II). Why couldn't we have seen things that would have altered our perception of the Star Wars universe? Like Obi-Wan losing his arm in the battle with Darth Maul? One event, as simple as that at the end of the movie, would have had the audience guessing for the next two films.<br />It seems that Lucas also can't just randomly extricate Jar-jar from the next film, because then it would look like he is bowing the public opinion. Something no artist would ever admit or adhere to. Also, as a sci-fi film this film is woefully boring the way it's photographed and directed. As with Empire and Jedi, Lucas should have hired another director to do this (and the other) films.<br />As it is I sincerely doubt I'll see Attack of the Clones (did he have to choose a B-movie title from say Republic Pictures catalog?) or the third film. I can't even stomach the first trilogy any more after this fiasco. And word is Lucas plans to go back and redo the digital effects on episodes 4 through 6 anyway. So it's high time I regulate these films to my nostalgic youth and reflect on better films by better filmmakers, like Francis Coppola and his highly anticapated Godfather trilogy.
020161622X|4.0|This book contains a good spread of techniques for making you a better software engineer. It discusses aspects of software development from refactoring to design by contract and a little about how each can be used effectively.<br />Those who are familiar with these techniques may find the book a little simple (or, at least, a quick read), but if you are looking for exposure to a variety of ways to improve your engineering approach, I recommend this book.
0792846443|4.0|An acting tour de force for stars James Caan and Kathy Bates and a triumph for director Rob Reiner.  The action is mostly confined to a single house and involves conflict between just two characters, yet the tension is palpable.  Bates' character undergoes violent and frightening mood swings, which are expertly played.  Caan's air of quiet desperation is also well-done.  William Goldman's script also deserves mention: the characters behave intelligently, so it is enjoyable to watch the cat-and-mouse game that unfolds before us.
6305570450|5.0|As many of you might notice, I gave Raiders a bad review.  I said that Crusade was THE Indy adventure that Raiders tried and failed to be.  But I also forgot to mention Indys seacond (Actually first, its one of the first &quot;Prequels&quot; ever made, taking place 10 years before the origional) adventure.  Doom is one of if not the best Action films of all time.  There is infinitly more action then Raiders could ever provide and a good story.  Indy is still as lovable as ever, with the addition of the neat Short round and the unfortunate addition of Indys new girlfriend (Can you spot Steven spielberg and George Lucas as hidden charachters?).  The story, while weak, is still good, with Indy trying to save kids from a thugge cult.  The action is unprecidented, with nifty special effects and a great pacing of it.  The bridge finalie is fantastic, and will make your heart stop at some points.  John Wiliams returns to try and make up for Raiders with his great moving soundtrack that fits well with the action.  Granted, this film is gresome in some points and is not for little kids, but this is still a fantastic action film.<br />The good: Its a Indy flick, Lots of satisfying action, great special effects, good story.<br />The bad: Parts of extreame violence and gore<br />And the ugly: not for little kids
014100018X|4.0|As I slip a nougat of dark chocolate into my mouth I feel a tingle go down my spine and my mouth craves more! More! This is similar to the sensation I got when turning each page of Chocolat. We all know what a treat a delicious piece of chocolate is to the tongue. But, this novel, Chocolat, was just as delicious to my soul. Just as I find myself craving my daily intake of the warm dark candy, I couldn't stoop thinking, yearning to get home to continue reading in my beloved novel, Chocolat. Whimsical and sentimental, with the perfect combination of ingredients, this novel takes its reader on a journey to the small French town where the story is set. A great book to curl up in bed to or relax after a long day.
B000002G8H|4.0|Pleasure to listen, Calpton's band is amazing here, including bass player Radle (RIP) and drummer Oldaker. All the eight songs are killers, a pleasure to listen, alternating slightly between straight rock, blues, country and pop, but always played spontaneoulsy and without commercialism. Perfetc album.
B000009EAD|5.0|This is another great Iced Earth album.  As always they stay true to their fans and never let us down.  Watching Over Me is one of the most well written songs I have heard in a long time and it gives you an idea about the band's history.
0783225970|5.0|what is up with the transfer-one of the worst of any dvd I have ever seen, it's jittery, shifts colors, BAD QUALITY.  I have talked to many people who have this dvd and they say the same thing.
B00005M989|4.0|One cannot challenge what the other outraged Prince fans have written - it's laughable that any one disc can even attempt to encompass the career of Prince.<br />Neither can we challenge the fact that Big Music is once again trying to line its pockets at the expense of one of the most creative artists the world has known.<br />That said, it does not take away from the fact that the Music on the compilation is the face of Prince's music to the world. The album &quot;1999&quot; made Prince one of the most recognizable musicians of the 1980's, and that's where this compilation begins... and it rocks on through most of Prince's CHART hits. Again I agree that a significant amount of Prince's best work never even sniffed the Billboard Top 40, but that does not diminish the appeal of the tracks that did.<br />The Purple Rain section alone (&quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, &quot;Let's Go Crzay&quot;, &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, and &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot;) jars one back to the 1980s when Prince actually went toe to toe with Wacko Jacko himself... and won. The synth-laced, psychedelic pop that marked this juncture of Prince's career made him a superstar, and made fans out of many who have since discovered his &quot;better&quot; work - including myself.<br />There are lots of great pop hooks all over the place here, from the funk of &quot;Kiss&quot;, the slow burn of &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, the smooth sex in &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; and the sleek &quot;Money Don't Matter 2 Night.&quot; If you focus on what you HAVE here, rather than what's not, then this compilation is worth far more than a lot of other compilations out there.<br />&quot;The Very Best of Prince&quot;? Hardly. Definitive? Not on your life. But worth your $14? Absolutely.
B00005A46T|5.0|Wow!- These guys have really outdone themselves here. This is<BR>one pummeling, brutal METAL album- Not rap-rock, or nu-metal-<BR>it sounds more like death metal than anything. I'm a huge fan of<BR>Meshuggah, Slayer, etc. but this is so much more FUN to crank up in the car. The drumming is AWESOME, as are the vocals.<BR>Some of the lyrics are stupid, but who cares? They removed<BR>just about all traces of DJ's, rapping and kettle drum playing<BR>from the first CD and replaced it with pure agressive metal.<br />I'm pretty hard to impress these days, but I love this frickin' CD. If you love HEAVY music, you will too.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dylan's new album is his best lyrically and musically since  Blood on The Tracks. This album has so many different kinds of songs on it, from swing to rock, from banjo-based to electric clide guitar...the whole thing is a masterpiece. I don't know how he did this. This is better than Time Out Of Mind... Get this album, you will not be disappointed.
B00004XPPB|3.0|In 1997's &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, Al Pacino added another mafia film to his resume as he took Johnny Depp under his wing and taught him about ganster life, where survival of the fittest was the law of the land. Playing a character called Lefty, Al stumbles around talking about which car is better: Lincoln or Cadillac, and he says &quot;Forget about it&quot; about 4,000 times throughout the first 5 minutes of the movie. For once, Pacino was in the co-starring role, and I don't think he really belonged in this movie. He was probably only cast in this movie because of his image and his appearance. He is a terrific actor, but not in this one. This just wasn't the Al Pacino that we saw in &quot;Devils Advocate&quot; and &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. But, Johnny Depp surprised me with his performance that seemed to fit the mold more naturally. <br />The ending to the movie was very unpredictable and changed the entire context of the movie. There were some very good scenes of ganster violence within restaurants that were better than the classic's, like &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. But, Al Pacino's surprisingly lackluster performance did nothing to help this movie out. They should have cast Sean Penn.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I found Pearl Harbor to be a movie that not only pulled at my heartstrings (a lot, actually) it taught me a lot about the time period and the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor.  As a college student who was on vacation in Hawaii when this movie came out, I knew the basic background of Pearl Harbor and what had happened.  Seeing the movie in Waikiki, Honolulu, HI made that much more of an impact.  I visited Pearl Harbor a day later and was overocome with sorrow just as I had been at the movies.  It was unimaginable to me that I could feel this way over a MOVIE but this movie not only told a terrific love story, it gave a very in depth history lesson.  There are people out there that think that this movie doesn't cover enough of the actual bombing and doesn't touch on very important details.  However, this movie was not made to tell the ENTIRE history of this &quot;Day of Infamy&quot;, it was written to tell the general story and tie in a taste of Hollywood.  Overall, the movie was great, all-around.
B000002BE9|5.0|What can I say about this album?  Fiona has an amazing voice, writes beautiful music and has some of the best lyrics I've ever heard.  She has a style all on her own and does NOT sound like Alanis Morissette!  Get this album!  You won't be disappointed!
B00005NOZ6|5.0|The gods of music are so great.  I really liked the DVD and hearing &quot;Another Day&quot; live just makes this album.  Even though Petrucci has short hair I saw him at G3 and he's still goin' strong.  Buy this CD now, it's so freakin good.
6305137293|3.0|This is okay movie
B00005LMBK|5.0|anyone who has any taste in music will love this whole CD. i know to many people who listen to one kind of music to the exclusion of all others. well, this album has it all. dance, punk, hip-hop (dell is the man), everything. buy it, and savor every track.
