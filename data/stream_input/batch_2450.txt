B009GEFXLC|5.0|th<br />ought acting,cast interaction,writing were phenominal!<br />hopefully writers will not disturb/destroy relationship<br />between main characters as i thought i heard in promos<br />for 5/13 episode-if that happens i will never again watch<br />look at Bones-8seasons going strong!
B00B4JIVOS|5.0|Awesome, diverse and totally worth buying. They have improved tons since last album and their last one was awesome. One of my favorites of 2013
B003TH14H4|4.0|i liked the interaction between a young woman detective and<br />the charming playboy with some real substance under that<br />handsome face.
0425252868|5.0|This book will tell you a lot about the airmen and their aircraft who fought in the Second World War. It is an exciting read and well written. It should interest all who are wanting to know more of what happened during that time in the air war over Europe.
B000EVKWYY|5.0|This was my two sons' favorite story book.  Well, now they each have children, and I was happy to another book, so both would have a copy to share with their children.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I really liked this movie, the acting was great, and the plot was great too.  I would have given it five stars except for the excessive language, which didn't add anything to the movie.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|A classic ending to a great series. However, I would have liked the end to be more clean unless there is the possibility of another book after this.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|This moving was not what we thought we were getting. The abuse and viewing it as entertainment was hard to watch.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|i absolutly love these dvds they came to me new and on the exact arrival date!! I could not be happier!! my mom said it was going to be a waste of my money but it is not i watch them almost everyday and they are great to watch with the family! From personal experience it brought my family and i closer because we sit down and watch some episodes everynight!! GET THEM!!! THEY ARE AMAZONG AND WELL WORTH IT!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Intelligent. Complex. Akin to listening to streams of consciousness. &#34;Twisted&#34; in every sense of the word.<br />What more could you ask?
B0056CUZRA|5.0|A bit of a slow start, in my opinion, but once you got involved well worth the effort.... Very good read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book - now I'm ready to read BOOK2 - trying to decide if I want to watch the movie - will it be worth it ???
B004SIIBGU|5.0|ii love this app! its very handy. tthe only thing i would like to c improved is when there r different color items to pick from, the graphic details should be a little easier to place with the worded options if that makes any since lol

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie and performances by both stars. Fantastic love story. I recommend you rent this and watch it with the one you love
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I started reading this series way back when Robert Jordan published EYE OF THE WORLD in 1990. I noticed that there is a difference in writing style between Jordan and Sanderson but I am so thrilled that the story is finally complete.  23 years is an<br />awfully long time to wait for the conclusion.
B008602KQI|2.0|The story is too simple, not very clear. Is it about romance, is it about survial, is it about mankind and society?
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This series follows the book well. I really enjoyed watching them. The actors do a wonderful job. If you like Jane Austin then you will love this series!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is really fun and challenging.  My six year old and I team up in an attempt to conquer some of the more complicated levels.  It takes planning, a clear though process, and some luck to get past some of them.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|This is definitely a five star album because each song is very unique.  The three singles (Sail, Not Your Fault, Kill Your Heroes) are great but the rest of the album is awesome (if not better) .  Purchase this album!!  You will not be disappointed.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|Amusing at best. This film is a major disappointment given the reputation of the filmmaker and principal actors.  Don't bother.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun! To be honest, I only downloaded it because it was highlighted as the the free app of the day. But I'm so glad I did!! I literally play it every day! Very addicting!
B000I9VON0|5.0|What I look for is fun and adventure and I also love the actors in this film.  If you want a critic then you'll have to ask my daughter - she tends to spoil for me what I think is good.  Just lay back and enjoy this movie - they'll make you laugh.  First time watching I did not get everything and so the second time helped me understand.  I've watched this movie half a dozen times and will probably watch it again.
B00BMT9C84|4.0|Very warm movie. almost had a tear a few times. Barbra Streisand is still a very fine actress. Hope she does more stuff, like this. The dude was o.k. also.<br />haha
1612130283|1.0|I purchased this book to arouse my prurient interests.  It is so badly written that I lost interest after the first five chapters.
B00CBRAD2A|5.0|As always Arnold does a great action hero. Love the car. Some reason I was seeing only Conan during the fist fight at the end.
B000J670ZI|5.0|This movie will always make  me laugh and cry - it is fun and funny and meaningful and touching.  ENJOY an old classic
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|He may be a bit odd in his personal life, but he's still a really good actor. always 120% from him, no matter what he does.<br />Nice work Mr Cruise.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|Live it when sequels get the same actors from part one of their series! Over 2 hours long,  but didn't feel like it at all!
B000002UB6|5.0|Edgar Wilson Nye (not Mark Twain- look it up) said of Wagner's music that it is better than it sounds. The last album released by The Beatles, though not the last recorded, falls into the same category. It has some very memorable music, no fewer than three number one hits and some great live playing, but yet it's generally regarded as one of The Beatles weaker albums. The reason isn't the music, it's the way the album was put together that's the problem.<br /><br />The Beatles began the Let It Be (or Get Back as it was originally known) project with two aims. One was to return to their roots, playing straightforward songs as they used to in the beginning, with few overdubs and no recording trickery. The second was to make a documentary film of the recording process. Both of these praiseworthy objectives went disastrously wrong; in hindsight it's not hard to see why. By the beginning of 1969 the members of the group were largely going their separate ways and had very different ideas about the future of The Beatles. Paul wanted them to be a live band again. George was thoroughly disillusioned by everything to do with the band. John was so infatuated with Yoko Ono that he couldn't bear to be apart from her and saw nothing wrong in including her in everything The Beatles did. Ringo, although the most easy-going of the quartet, was finding it hard to see where he fit in the plans of the others and felt he was just being used rather than included. In the year and a half since Brian Epstein died, they had lurched from one crazy idea to another- making their own film, meditating in India, opening their Savile Row boutique/arts promotion center, getting Magic Alex to build a studio for them. All these ideas had gone badly wrong, they had spent an enormous amount of money and been bilked of a lot more and they had nothing to show for it but a financial mess. They hoped in the simplicity of the Get Back project to find stability, but it didn't work. The result was that insteadof the beautifully crafted albums of their golden period, they came up with a group of good, some even great, songs but with no polish or consistency. The music was better than it sounds.<br /><br />The album starts with a truly lovely and simple song- 'Two Of Us'. A pretty tune, wistful words and brilliant harmonies by John and Paul It's one of my favorite Beatles' songs. Strangely, it came about during one of the low points of the session, a big argument between George and Paul; but the song itself is pure and innocent of all negative implications.<br /><br />After that comes one of the songs recorded at the Rooftop Concert in January 1969, Lennon's 'Dig A Pony'; a raw belter, with Lennon in good voice. That is followed by an intruder, a song not recorded for the album at all, Lennon's 'Across The Universe', taken from a 1968 recording and extensivly remixed, to the point of changing the key (so much for getting back!). Then we get 'I Me Mine', again not recorded as part of the Get Back Project, but recorded in early 1970 by Harrison (whose song it was), McCartney and Starr- Lennon was 'away' at the time.<br /><br />50 seconds of 'Dig It', lead vocal by Lennon, composition credited to all four Beatles, follows and is succeeded by a studio version of 'Let It Be', though not the single release. Then we have a snatch of the old street song 'Maggie Mae'- the only cover released by The Beatles in their final 3 years.<br /><br />'I've Got A Feeling', Lennon, is followed by a real throwback, 'One After 909', a song which the Beatles recorded but did not release in their very first album session in 1963. Both these come from the rooftop concert and have the merit of being live performances, which gives them energy if not sophistication.<br /><br />Probably among the worst recordings musically and technically is 'The Long And Winding Road', which is really no better than a demo disc, featuring a strong McCartney vocal but awful backing, with Lennon demonstrating that he can't play bass. Then we have the Harrison 'For You Blue', pleasant enough, and the great McCartney song 'Get Back'. This is a studio version, but John's line from the rooftop concert hoping that they passed the audition is tagged on the end.<br /><br />Many people had a hand in production, including Glyn Johns and Phil Spector, but notably missing was George Martin. The result is not so much that individual songs are bad (indeed, Spector's involvement probably saved 'Long And Winding Road'), but that the sounds and styles are all over the map- a far cry from the cohesive structure of the Martin-produced albums. This gives the impression that the album was thrown together without thought, rather than having the longest and most painful birth process of any Beatles album.<br /><br />The strength of the songs on this album merits 5 stars, but it stands as one of the great wasted opportunites in popular music. We can only imagine how good this album might have been if George Martin had produced it; he was shortly to demonstrate how much The Beatles had missed him by producing 'Abbey Road'.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app it's the frikin bomb. How could anyone not love a free alarm clock app. It has the weather the day and the time
B009MYAQOA|5.0|I haven't finished it yet but it is amazing so far and I think it is going to get better. It was an assignment for an architecture class of all things. Yet it is the basic story of mores and a relationship between a man and a woman. Great reading.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It's not a miracle.It didn't heal me ! It did what it said it would do...I guess I like the large display...
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The first book was just OK....I was really in to the second book and the third book was ho-hum.  It actually took me 3 months to finish it.
B005KB0SU6|4.0|Un libro diferente a todos los que he le&iacute;do.<br />Te engancha desde las primeras p&aacute;ginas.<br />Lo recomiendo para quienes les gustan las lecturas intensas y llenas de intriga y misterio.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I purchased this on my kindle after looking for something easy to read without having to read straight through. Just had 3rd baby and knew I wouldn't have much time to myself. It is a hilarious collection of stories from Tina's childhood through adulthood and would be easily relatable for any female. It kept me laughing page after page!
B00133KFGW|5.0|watched this with friends awhile back and we were all touched by this lovely exquisite mystical film; can't wait to share it with others
B003XYE7VS|4.0|Should be required reading at all primary schools at least be taught before high school. Gives a basic knowledge of all thats real in a easy to understand way. Great read.
B005XLN97M|5.0|The 4 year old twins I bought this for love it. The Barbie House was ordered for Christmas and arrived perfect and on time. I would recommend it for other children.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I enjoyed the novel very much. I like anything that has to do with Bones. It was an interesting book.
B00258SS72|5.0|It was a good movie. I would recommend for people to watch this movie any time. I give it five stars.<3
B009NY43NY|5.0|With out spoiling it, it's a great way to end the series! A must have for your Charlain Harris collection.
193700788X|1.0|After reading Dead Reckoning I knew that the series was going to take a nose dive into WTF. First of all, the book didn't read like the other Sookie Stackhouse books. It's hard to explain, but all the characters looked different in my mind - Eric was no longer the Eric from the previous books. I did not care at all for Sookie like I did in the previous books.<br /><br />So, like I did when the re-make of Footloose came out - I didn't watch it, read out about it, and forgot its exists. By doing this, I was able to retain my love for the original Footloose as well as my love for the previous Sookie Stackhouse books, therefore I can go back and reread them with no bile in my mouth. Because I knew if I read the last two books, I would give away ALL of my Harris books.<br /><br />After reading the reviews for the last book, my prediction about Harris' nose dive was correct. So therefore, I will make up my own ending because this is FICTION and I can make anything happen. Starting at the end of Dead in the Family, I have two endings.<br /><br />(1) Sookie's fairy genes kick in. She becomes magical and immortal. As a result she's now part of Fairy Royalty line with valid claims to the throne. Being a Fairy princess and all Sookie's marriage/breeding partner, who is a full fairy, is arranged. He's a cool bean - hot, nice, hot, and a great guy, but Sookie's holding out for Eric. Eric becomes a King of a state or two after getting out of his arranged marriage. Sookie and Eric manage to find a way to stay together, which causes the vampires and fairies to nag and moan about, but they get over it. Sookie and Eric fly off to Italy to live forever together with Pam and Pam's new vampire girlfriend who looks just like Selene from Underworld and wears black leather cat suits. Don't care about Bill and the others.<br /><br />(2) Sookie's grandfather gives her another magical item which she uses to \\"cure\\" or make all the vampires \\"alive\\" again. Now that Eric's not shooting blanks anymore - Sookie and Eric can be together as humans and breed a lot of babies who will end up becoming very close friends with Tara's children. Bill who? Alcide who? Sam who?<br /><br />I don't think I'm going to watch True Blood anymore either. I didn't care how far away they strayed from the books - as long as they gave me my shower scene. If you read the books, you know what I'm talking about. Instead I get Sookie and Eric tripping on each other's blood and flocking in the forest. To add insult to injury - Bill and Sookie ended up having that show scene instead. I am so not team Bill.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I liked the twist in the book and the writing. Interesting characters and the best first kiss in the history of kisses.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The book is easy to read and keeps you guessing throughout. There are so many different elements that are combined to make up the story - you have the human element and the relationships between the charactes intertwined with an interesting concept and background story. You think you have figured out the plot but you are never quite sure as you just get given glimpses of new twists every so often. This book will keep you hooked.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am still reading... but so far so good. I bought this for college read and actually have enjoyed it more that I thought I would. . It is way better than the movie due to the authors description and captivating story telling.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|A murder mystery that was intriguing & full of suspense - infact a great read for guys & girls.  I couldn't put it down.  It dissolved hours of train travel in my week and made the trips something to look forward to.  There are parts in the book that are  disturbing & shocking so I wouldn't recommend it to my mum.
B0030B621W|5.0|its simple, its nothing out there in cinematic or CGI. But it definitely leaves you much more content than many big budget movies. and it has some themes that were completely opposite than what I expected. a must watch.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Although Dark Places is my least favorite of Gillian Flynn's 3 books, it was still a dark, twisted tale that sucks you in just like all her others! She has a way of really creating these truley disturbed characters...like the ones in Dark Places. I also enjoyed a hidden quick reference to her 1st novel during a really creepy moment at a visit to a Kill Club.<br />It will keep you wanting to keep reading & keep reading & wondering who you should be routing for. It hits a few little slow patches, but as expected from Gillin Flynn has plot twist that make your mind boggle.
B005ILYWN2|4.0|Although this says &#34;English Subtitled&#34;, my copy had both English and Norwegian dialogue.  In fact, three versions appear on Amazon's website, a DVD and Blu-Ray with subtitles only, and a DVD with the two language tracks, which was the one I bought.  As usual, there are slight differences between the subtitle and voice translations with the subtitles occasionally providing a clearer translation.  This is evident in the deleted scenes which are subtitled only.<br /><br />This was a great little movie, especially for the money.  I was very impressed with the special effects.  The trolls were a surprise and well done.  The hunter, his equipment and truck were perfect for the storyline, and the rest of the visuals were excellent.  While the acting of a couple of characters was a bit rough at times, the rest of the cast made up for it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone wanting an hour and a half of good fun.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|i loved this book ,the different  factions all after the one throne. the different story lines for all the characters..great read the stories within the main story .great read
B001NVIZ3E|4.0|Kids enjoyed it! Wish there were more like this available. Please bring back more of the old productions on Instant Video!
B00000JPH6|4.0|this is a great movie and my grand children will love it as much as my kids did, its great
B006MW3V6U|2.0|I started out enjoying this, as I like period drama, but honestly, it's just getting too trashy  and not worth my time. It's true that good and evil exist[ed] in the world, no matter the social status, but really!!?? Can't ANY of the characters be honorable and upstanding without having some sort of scandal associated with them? Please!!<br />The quality of the production is great [as I expected] and I enjoyed the behind the scenes look at life among the servants very much; appreciated the fact that they are depicted as more than mere robots with no life or personality of their own. [as is often the case in period productions],,,,,,but alas! One can hardly respect any of the characters in this series anymore, so I've stopped watching.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|Pretty impressive but limited on Kindle Fire without GPS.  Still, the maps are there if you fiddle around enough you can find your way t o a place and home.  Whoops!  I'm  thinking of the pro version.  Lite is still pretty good.  Looking forward to improvements in the pro version.
B00B7XGFO4|2.0|One of the Best of the Jane Eyre Movies but this restored version  LOOKS awful.  This fine movie and music from John Williams deserves so much better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The second season continues its excellence.  This is story telling of the highest caliber.  No music to distract and none is needed to establish moods for the audience.  It is a great &#34;reality show&#34; in the best of sense.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|A small, inexpensive, D to A convertor. Works fine for my needs in a little audio system. No bells and whistles---which sometimes is actually an advantage. This hits the mark!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|hard to put down.  can't wait for his next book.  his characters are well defined and his humor made me laugh despite the circumstances.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|It started out pretty good, but the plot was stalled for most of the book and hastily resolved at the end.

0375703764|3.0|So I bought this book used for $13 I think. I get the package, and the book that they said was &#34;good&#34; condition, I would say is more &#34;its still alive&#34;. The cover had been detached at some point, and been reattached with some tape. Cool. The cover doesn't even seem to be the same size as the book, its short.<br /><br />Other than the appearance of the book, its ok. I had read a lot of reviews on this one, and thought it would be great. Its alright. I read through maybe 60% of it before slowing down, and right now its on the shelf I am not reading it at all. I will finish it at some point. Not as captivating as I anticipated. Might just want to put your name on the Hold List at the public library instead of buying it.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Okay, first thing I want to go over is the cover. I love the cover of this book. The model who portrays Cricket is really good looking. I love his outfit. The plaid shirt and the pinstrip pants are an interesting combination, but it totally works. And then there is Lola... She is cute. I love her outfit. I would totally wear it. I am so not good at putting together outfits, but what she is wearing is so cute.<br /><br />And the story was so cute. I haven't read Anna and the French Kiss yet, but this book totally put it on my library queue. I cannot wait for it to arrive. I do not like love triangles. I was initially worried that I would have this problem in this book, since there was the whole Criket - Lola - Max triangle... but Cricket is so perfect that really it was no competition, and in the end, Max was not worthy of Lola.<br /><br />The cast of characters that Perkins put together were perfect. Nathan and Andy remind me of Cameron and Mitchell from Modern Family. They are probably two of my favorite characters so you can view this as a compliment. I like how they are strict and not your &#34;typical gays&#34; (whatever that means). They are awesome!!! And then there is Lindsey... I love how she is a Nancy Drew wannabe and that she called Lola &#34;Ned&#34;. She was amazing. She truly was a great best friend. And then there is Anna and St. Clair. I have not read Anna and the French Kiss yet but seeing them in this book makes me really interested in it. They are so cute and really seem to be soul mates.<br /><br />Collipe is one of those characters that, by the end of the book, you are on her side... and you totally get why she acted the way she did. As an overprotective sibling, I totally get why she did some of the things that she did to Lola. Max is someone that you are kind of ambigious about until you aren't... I won't say anything more about that because I don't want to ruin anything. And then there is Cricket. Perfect, dependable Cricket. There isn't really much to say about Cricket other than that he is amazing.<br /><br />I love how the setting is in California. I am from California and let me tell you, there aren't a lot of great books set in California.<br /><br />Really, all I can say is that this book is AWESOME and if you haven't read it... go get it! Read and it! And then come back here and tell me what you think about this book!ly much to say about Cricket other than that he is amazing.<br /><br />I love how the setting is in California. I am from California and let me tell you, there aren't a lot of great books set in California.<br /><br />Really, all I can say is that this book is AWESOME and if you haven't read it... go get it!

B00BWJARHO|3.0|When I saw how long this movie was my first thought was that at almost 3 hours long it was about an hour and a half longer than it needed to be to tell a relatively short story (compared to LOTR). And then I was amazed to learn that this was actually just the first installment of a trilogy.<br />Although I would have liked a shorter movie I have to admit that Peter Jackson kept things moving. Also, I am aware that many Tolkien fans will welcome being in middle earth for as long as possible.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The actors were great and that was the biggest draw, but the movie was tedious.  The cult, which seemed to be based on a Ron L. Hubbard character, led by Phillip Seymour Hoffman (The Master) took in a damaged alcoholic Joaquin Phoenix for no apparent reason except as an experiment to maybe make him well and join them. From then on it was dark, uncomfortable, and pointless.  It didn't draw out sympathy or empathy for the characters, so my interest in the movie was waning throughout. It skipped around with no explanation of how or why. The performances were, however outstanding. Don't waste your time.

B00005JPTK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much! Makes a person wonder, what if this were to really happen, how would you handle it?
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A great addition to my Lord of Rings Trilogy. This movie isn't as dramatic as the trilogy, but still a very good story. Can't wait until the next one.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Great movie presents an epic struggle of the pioneer West. John Wayne is at his rugged best in this story of a man's years long search for his nieces taken by Comanches. No other JW movie shows such a gut-real change in his character's emotions. Some extraordinary cinematography in Monument Valley showcases this iconic Western landscape. I was there in 2012 and this movie shows the valley to be largely unchanged since the movie was filmed.
1400079276|4.0|If you're looking for a nice, down to earth tale with a comfortable and predictable plot, you won't like this book.  Murakami's style of writing is no holds-barred.  He creates a dream-world where fish and leeches have unsettlingly started falling from the sky -- where sentient beings that take the likenesses of Johnnie Walker and Colonel Sanders (Yes, the KFC guy.)  intertwine with a teenager, Kafka Tamura, who  lived with his father, while his mother and sister had suddenly disappeared years earlier.  To try and find his missing family members, or perhaps because of the oedipal prophecy his father had revealed, he runs away from home.  His life connects with other characters, such as Nakata, a \\"not-so-bright,\\" yet very polite individual who has the unusual ability to talk to cats, as well as a steel-witted transgender librarian named Oshima, who seems to understand that meeting Kafka was more than just a chance occurrence.<br /><br />This was my first time reading something from a foreign author, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is written in a very detailed manner which makes it easy to picture landscapes and empathize with the characters, which I liked; however, I felt that all the detail was unnecessary with certain parts of the book, but Murakami leaves nothing unsaid -- even intricate and sometimes disturbing details.  Regardless, I did enjoy the book and I believe I will read another of Murakami's books at some point.

1433524708|4.0|I haven't read much in this study bible yet, only paging through so far.  I ordered it because I handled this one in a local book store a few weeks ago and had to have one.  The cover has a really good feel, the Celtic cross and design is very nice and the binding is smyth sewn, so good quality all around.  This is my first study bible in ESV so I'm glad to have one in that translation and this Crossway version has the highest ratings.  Really nice tables, diagrams and maps throughout.  My only 2 issues is that the font size is too small, and I actually like the double column layout better than the single column in this one, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  But am I glad I have it?  Yes, its a wonderful little study bible.  I would certainly recommend it.
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and I got so hooked on this series, we actually stayed up late many nights just to finish an episode, always wanting more. I'm not a big fan of Sci Fi but once I got past the weird creatures (skitters, harness-snails, and overlords, oh my!) I loved the many story lines as characters did their best to survive in a completely new world after &#34;aliens&#34; arrived on our planet. Noah Wylie is great as the dad of 3 sons and was very believable in this role. I hadn't seen much of him since ER days and enjoyed his older wiser persona. Besides enjoying the family dynamics, group dramas and military versus civilians story lines, I also was impressed by the provocative overarching themes of how humans might go about rebuilding society, civilization and culture when so many disparate groups have survived something as life changing as Beings from another planet arriving to fulfill their own agenda. At times I felt myself being way more fearful of how humans were pitted against one another even when they were trying to figure out how to fight off, or perhaps work with, the aliens. We just finished Season 1 and can't wait to watch Season 2!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is very sensitive and quick.  You can change the sensitivity, which I had to do until I got used to it.  The buttons are fantastic... I programmed them to copy and paste & delete.  I love the ability to change the anchor color (it lights up).  Well worth the money.  I also love the fabric type cord.  It comes with weights you can add inside the mouse.  This is the best mouse I have ever owned!!!
B0063M22QO|3.0|I love to play Mahjongg, but this is a little boring and am disappointed in the play. Would like more of an interesting game.
193700788X|1.0|Sookie ends up with Sam, Eric ends up in slavery to never see Sookie again. Really? As an author you have control over what your characters do this is true but also it is your fans that keep  you going. I guess you felt that you had enough fans, made enough money and just didnt care about your fans or your characters for that matter. I mean hell you could have added a freaking twist of her being half fae that it allowed her to have a child with a vamp so could have ended up with Eric but no, you had to put in such a horrible ending for his character that it just makes me want to burn my BOOKS!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The case fits great, love the color and it works to hold my Kindle in the right positions.  I am so pleased with it.  My son recommended that I buy it, I did, and now I would recommend it to everyone to buy.  It made my Kindle even better.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I have evernote on all my devices so I can see notes regardless of which device I am using. There are better Apps out there, in particular Noteworthy, among others.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This video show exactly how talented Michael Jackson is and this outstanding video brings it all together.  This video gives you such an awe of appreciation as if you are actually in the audience.
B004GFN11A|3.0|If you write a blog the Kindle App is okay in a pinch but stick to using your laptop because typing, at least on the original Kindle Fire, is cumbersome.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Great story line and characters. Loved the twists and cliffhangers . I've be looking for a good show to replace my 24 addiction, and this is it.
B007N85POS|5.0|I have most, if not all, of the Angry Birds games and this is my favorite one of them all.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|This is definitely a different Clutch I'm listening to in this album. I am VERY happy about that. I've loved the last few albums, but they were a tiny bit too bluesy for my taste. They've gone in a much heavier direction, and I love it!
0316067598|5.0|Marcus Luttrell's story is one of the most powerful and moving books I've ever read. The bond that develops between men  in combat is impossible to explain but Luttrell does an amazing job of sharing his experience. Having served in combat myself, I was moved to tears in parts of this book.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Great little game. Addicting thoughts careful.I always have a lot of fun playing this game. It's got pretty cute graphics too.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Maybe Victor Hugo's best work although it is hard to narrow it down to one book when you are talking about one of the greatest writers in history.
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|So far people have loved to talk this album down, but I found it to be really enjoyable. Still got the Blues was worth the price of admission!!!  I mean , it's Eric Clapton.  If it was Eric Smith WXPN would have it in their top 10.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|The calculator works great but there is a ton of advertising that comes along with it. I'm sure there are better Apps out there and I usually use the one on my phone instead.
B001NKI60W|5.0|This movie is so much FUN!!!!<br />The dancing and singing bring joy, the actors even seem to be enjoying themselves and the scenery is gorgeous
1936891026|4.0|Pressfield is a brilliant writer of historical fiction. This book is filled with mantras he uses to get himself motivated to ply his craft on a daily basis.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very good family movie with suspense and heart warming moments. A must see based on a true story. Acting and camera work was amazing.
B000JML90Y|3.0|As a Christian I wanted to see what Mr. Darwin had to say in his own words. To be sure the political left has corrupted much of what he says in this book. The writing is easy enough to understand but is quite dry and tedious.
B005PK56TA|5.0|The show keeps getting better.  Each season has its own story and is very enjoyable.  The best is how great the actors are ian this show.  How did this little show attract such great actors?
B0088P2A7A|5.0|If you like to look things up while reading this is a great App to have on your Kindle Fire.
1476734941|5.0|Common sense approach. Have been doing it for seven weeks and I feel good. Slow and steady.<br />Will make it a lifetime practice.
B00111NDQK|5.0|I have several pairs of Timberland boots and casual shoes in my closet and they're all extremely comfortable. I wear suits a lot for work so on weekends I like to be comfortable and Timberland gets the job done!
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|All modern albums should sound like this.<br /><br />First off, no brickwalling, so I will spend money and buy it.<br /><br />Like almost every album made in the CD era, it's too long. Trim the fat and you have a potentially great album. More isn't always better, look at every Metallica album after Justice, or every Rush album after Power Windows (but before Clockwork Angels which is just brilliant start-to-finish), etc.<br /><br />No, it's not Machine Head, but it's good in its own right.<br /><br />Gillan isn't far away form 70, and his voice shows it, but again judge on it's own right and not compare to In Rock/Machine Head.<br /><br />Great musicianship, a few great songs, a bit too much filler though.<br /><br />I'd dump Body Line and Blood From A Stone, and forget about the silly throwaway Cliff Richard cover bonus track. Take an hour long album down to a nice tight vinyl-era 45 minutes.<br /><br />Oh and I don't know if they did it deliberately as a tribute to the late great Jon Lord, but the star on this album is Don Airey. More keyboard influene than past albums.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|One of my favorite video games growing up and its a blast playing it on my Kindle Fire, sure brings back memories.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I am So glad I was able to watch this episode so they didn't air it in the US.  Well worth the $2 I had to pay!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is a super fun way to play. You get six new levels each week and get to challenge your friends in a tournament format.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game because of the action. You have limitless play time and being able to restart the game as many times as you want. It also saves your last high score so you know what to aim for.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I have linkedin on all of my devices and the Kindle/Android version is good but the Apple platform is better.
1423124111|5.0|The Disney Poster archives over the years, with the signifigance and history behind them.  Beautiful book and well presented.  A must-have for Disney fans.
B009R659L8|5.0|Another great book by Mary Higgins Clark. Once i started the book it was hard to put down.I thought I knew who done it early on but I was wrong in the end. LOL!LOL! Highly recommend the book.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like this game, it makes you think fast. I like challenging games. I would tell my friends about it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have played many of these types of games and this is by far one of the best. nice storyline
B00821OX98|5.0|I think this series is great. I got sick last year and missed the whole think. This was a fun thing to watch
B005H9B44A|3.0|There isn't anything special about thor, he is just a dumb jock like superman. Peter parker is smart so even when he loses his powers he still has a brain. BK-201 of &#34;Kuro no keiyakusha&#34; lost all of his powers and he was still kicking ass. That is a good superhero.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I have created five notebooks so far for different purposes..Easy to use and organize, even has a speaking mode so it can read your notes back to you... keep notes on any info you want to maintain or keep handy<br />Create to do lists, gift buying lists,anything you want to remember later...and  organize them by color and title..Great app
B0081KTI0E|3.0|I am giving this 3 stars just to be fair, I honestly don't think it is scary, but the people I watched it with they think it is, so that  is why the 3 stars rate. it was nice to watch and I was having a good time with friends.
B00BQ1DBUS|2.0|I must say I have only heard a few songs off of the cd. I was hoping for the passion of the 1970's Rod. When the Faces were backing him, man that was the best. Roots music, folk music, something different than 20 years ago. Rod playing some harmonica. The band with dobro, mandolin, and a banjo. Something like Robert Plant, Gregg Allman, or Dion have been doing the last few years. Maybe a cover of a Muddy Waters, B.B.King or Sonny Boy. All in all not what I was hoping for.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Interesting concept that is well executed. Excellent special effects and good acting combine with a clever script that keeps you watching. Can't trust governments or scientists, so keep looking over your shoulder.
B00004RGUI|5.0|The music is so soothing and calm. I love water sound. It is nice healing sound and I enjoyed it.
B00821OX98|3.0|Good concept and special effects. Mediocre acting, story line and dialogue. Good potential, poorly executed. Expected more from Steven Spielberg.
1451695195|4.0|The interesting part about this account is that this is from a very well educated man of science, who had not been a believer before.  He tells very well how this experience could not have been something which just happened due to the attack on his brain.  It is remarkable that he recovered fully and has been able to continue his life work.
0393345084|1.0|This book really exposes the extreme lunacism prevailing among Keynesian economists today. Don't waste your time unless you are curious to learn how far the lunacy goes. Of course, you won't hear Krugman discussing the end game after another few trillions are thrown at the economy and, just by chance, it doesn't improve. What's next - keep trying? Yes! That's what the man suggests. In other words, either succeed following Keynes or all goes to hell. Heads I win (god Keynes was right), tail everyone loses (impossible). That's not science, that's religion. That's not scientific engineering or planning, that's gambling.
B009R659L8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I have read several of Mary Higgins Clark's books and have loved them all.
B0026QC0YU|5.0|The Mission Impossible series is very entertaining if you like action/adventure movies.  They are a modern and slightly more comical James Bond since they get a little outlandish with the gadgets and the disguises/masks.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Another great one! Cant wait to read the next in the series. So many great story lines. Read the books first before watching the series.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Love but wow three movies from one short boot and a couple of addition books? Two maybe but three is ridiculous
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|Six of the Eagles early albums, all of them loaded with good music, at a great price and assembled in very compact packaging. Very pleased.
B0097K21YW|3.0|This game is a take-off on \\"Angry Birds,\\" with a Godzilla theme.  In that regard, it doesn't get many points for originality.  It's fun, it's just not anything new.  Plus, you have to use real money to buy upgrades, which is nothing short of annoying.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />For reference, if you're not familiar with \\"Angry Birds,\\" here's a link:  [[ASIN:B004SJ3BCI Angry Birds Free]]<br /><br />Like \\"Angry Birds,\\" you use your fingers to set up a shot that sends ammo sailing through the air, destroying the target.  It's an aim, shoot, & destroy game.<br /><br />Oops!  I forgot to mention - downloaded as a free app of the day promotion.  In my humble opinion, it's probably worth a spin at 99 cents.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Wonderful story of one womans struggle with her feelings of worthlessness as she attempts to accept unconditional love. Great insight to unspoken communication.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Absolutely excellent novel.  Well paced and well written.  The ending was a little disappointing because it was so quick and expected, but other than that, absolutely STELLAR.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Maybe I'm naive, but I never saw it coming. What a twist to a great story. Intriguing & intense throughout.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The title pulled me into this book and I really enjoyed reading it.  I felt a lot of sympathy for the main character and was so, so happy with the way it ended.  Excellent story.
B008Q0D32S|4.0|Although a &#34;B&#34; western in my opinion, has some of the best music.  Gets a little slow but plenty of action.  If you love the old westerns this won't dissappoint.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game, but it constantly shuts down on me.  It takes at least 3x to finally open up.  When I'm trying to accept the gifts, it shuts down after I've accepted some.<br />They need to improve and update the problems before they try out something new.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Plenty of action! Great stunts!  Shia continues to be perfect in this role.  There is plenty of action to keep all of the action buffs happy.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I am so glad I was able to get this as a gift for my sister for her new blue ray player.  It is a clearer movie picture and she can share them with her grandchildren.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed Mockingjay this series.  I have read all three titles at least three times each because I liked it so much.  The writer moves the story along quickly and keeps the reader glued to the book.  It's difficult to put it down.
B000NMW6M0|3.0|It has 3 plots going at the same time and you don't tie them in till the end. I enjoyed it.
0812982622|5.0|This book grabs you from the beginning and holds you as the humanity of the main character is awakened and a hero comes to life.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This is such a fun series. True entertainment.  Each season has its own flavor and leaves you begging for more.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Although this book is meant for teens I thought it was a great read. It was definitely able to keep my attention!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Could do without so many ads but realize that's just how it has to be but play a lot. Love it.
B00AEFZBAU|5.0|Such a great movie, surprising and thought provoking. You'll want to watch it again,  and let your friends borrow it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's just like being on a computer. Pictures are clear and large enough to see. I just love it and my kindle.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I believe if I had not read the book, I would have been totally confused.  Loved Jennifer Lawrence -- her face is so full of her emotions.
0792163710|4.0|One western that truly deserves to be called a classic and certainly the best<br />film ever made by the plodding, ham-handed and preachy George Stevens.<br />He remains, along with Hitchcock, the most over-rated of all directors.<br />But even a blind hog can root up an acorn now and then and \\"Shane\\" is<br />Steven's acorn.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Better films out there where you don't already know the ending.  Moves slowly but that is done since they do not really have a lot to show.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Entertaining hard enough to keep you interested. Works well simple interface. Why do I have to have a specific number of words. Dumb.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It would satisfy you if you had a city building game craving its a los better than city Ville on Facebook
B001P3SA94|5.0|Another on of my favorites! Good for the DVD collection and to learn about the history of Chess Records and the many artists who recorded for the label.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It served its purpose of entertainment, but I don't think I would watch it again. It had some funny parts!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the Spider very much I play everyday. It is ridiculous that i have to write a specific number of words as a comment, will not do anymore surveys.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Being of Irish descent, I wanted to learn about the Irish culture.  I'm also gathering information for a planned trip to Ireland.<br />This is a  special year in Ireland, called the &#34;Gathering&#34;, when all Americans of Irish descent are invited to come to Ireland.  This may be a marketing tool for tourist industries in Ireland, but who cares?  I would love to go there, and do my own version of &#34;Roots,&#34;
B00BF11STU|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie since I loved The Hurt Locker.  However, I was very disappointed.  The actors -- especially the female lead -- seemed so inauthentic and I couldn't help but notice the makeup that she was wearing (somehow I doubt that in the middle of a desert landscape anyone would be wearing eye makeup or lipstick.  This fact alone made me recognize just how boring her performance was.  How many times can you run your hands through your hair or over your face to show frustration?  The torture of the prisoners was brutal and personally I thought over-used; I had to look away many times.  I also thought the pacing was way too slow or maybe the acting and script was just not good enough to sustain the slow pace.<br />Give me HOMELAND and Claire Danes any day!
B009EFP278|5.0|I love this CD, everyone should buy it. Hey you beautiful and dear darlin are awesome songs. Keep it up Olly!!!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I totally enjoyed watching this movie.  The effects were stupendous, the acting superb & the story was realistic & heartwarming.<br />Watts was extraordinary in her role as the mother who is separated by her children & spouse. It is a very emotional story & it brought tears to my eyes, on many occasions, throughout the movie but, it was well worth it. If you haven't seen it I would recommend that you do so.  It is a true story & worthwhile seeing. Definitely a 5 Star movie.
B00499QUK2|4.0|If you like mysteries, you will like this.  It is fast moving<br />and full of twists and turns.<br /><br />Thank you
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great directing job. Historical moment now revealed. Not a lot of action but some parts will put you at the edge of your seat.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|I really thought there was going to be a lot more action but the movie is not actually dissappointing since it's about a young girl and you cant expect it to be like a full fledged spy action movie, but overall, it's a pretty enjoyable movie.
B007REV4T8|4.0|The movie was good but only a four star rating. Action was good but could have been better for a bond movie.
0670026557|5.0|Excellent volume.  The science behind the ideas is explained clearly, and it is very readable.  It should be of great interest to students in psychology and business as well as to professionals who are concerning about the development of their own careers. It raises many questions as well.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Good movie even though Jet Li does not play the whole movie. This is a good re recording but not good enough. Towards the end of the movie, the disc show some sigh of poor quality.
1468179993|5.0|The book is succinct and very well organized.  It offers good advice, often with examples, of how a talk or lecture should be prepared and organized to deliver its message clearly and in an interesting way.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Love this movie. Lots of action and Jeremy Rener did a great job. I like this more than Skyfall. Highly recommend this to the Bourne fans to add to their collection.
B0097K21YW|4.0|At least, that was my first thought. But sadly, not as cool. No peasants or big, beefy arm. Heh. It's a flingy kind of game where you pull back and shoot.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Personally my best movie. Lots of action and to see actual Seals in action and how they perform (not acting) and the use of live ammo in the movie is amazing. Highly recommend this to the war buffs.
1451696191|4.0|Although I am in my mid twenties I still loved it. It had me reminiscing of my teenage years. I am going to give this to my nephew who will be starting high school next year.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This pack holds allot of stuff, My mac, all dongles and power, tools and software including a water bottle in the side pocket, files and other utilities I carry for my job daily. It's rugged and just works. Well worth the money.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|As stated the game is a ton of fun, however there are two major interconnected issues. Firstly you simply cannot progress without spending money, secondly like with ANOTHER Gameloft game I was charged money that I NEVER actually spent!!<br /><br />Amazon support was able to identify the false charges and have them handled, they even spotted things I had missed. Sadly this is the second Gameloft title I have had amazingly great fun with but have had to delete for the exact SAME problem.<br /><br />With luck Gameloft at the very least will fix their charging system to avoid the constant double-charges. Even better if Gameloft decided to design their great looking fun to play games so you are not forced to constantly pull out your credit card to progress within the game.<br /><br />In short, download at own risk...
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Love this movie....it's always fun to watch for a good laugh and I always check Amazon first for anything I'm looking for......very fast service and cheaper.
B000002L68|5.0|Stop wasting your time with this review.  Scroll back up the page, click &#34;BUY THIS NOW&#34; or whatever the one-click button says, and get yourself a copy.
6304696515|5.0|Love this movie and am thinking about reading the book. A great cast all around and a well done movie.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is smart, witty, hilarious, and heartwarming. Season 8 doesn't disappoint. I do not want his show to end.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Frank Ocean is an artist to be reckoned with. His style reminds me of some of the grants. While Crack Rock doesn't appeal to me much, Thinkin' Bout You has qualities that touch my soul, as does many other tracks from Channel Orange...Great!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having had a similar experience, I appreciate the author's desire to share his adventure of that deep mysterious other world.  The book is well written and uplifting.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really enjoyed this game....it really made you work at winning...it was fun to finally win the game...Use your bonuses wisely
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter is full of surprises. It keeps me wanting  to see the next adventure.  Can't wait for season 8.  What is Debbie going to do next ? ?
B0054YH8DY|5.0|one of my favorite records of all time although I have it on vinyl  my turntable is in another state and I will not be getting it for several months although I could find some compilation c ds that had most of the songs on it I wanted the original  and it was not easy to find then i tried amazon and sure enough they had it and for a reasonable cost a brand new copy  so I now can listen to Bookends and I am happy thanks amazon
B009NY43NY|1.0|I still gave this a chance after the spoilers... I really wish I hadn't. I started it, and it's a complete stranger to me. It doesn't even READ like a Sookie book. And that upsets me most of all. The other POVs make less than no sense, Sookie in DEA is someone I would NEVER root for (let alone read 12 freaking books about). I won't even bother talking about some of the things that were impossible to stomach as someone who has been reading these for the past decade. Suffice to say, Charlaine... when you were talking about it being a Shakespearean ending, did you actually ever read any Shakespeare? How on EARTH is that a Shakespearean ending? It was the most mundane and pointless ending I have ever read!<br /><br />*******SPOILERS AHEAD********Honestly, if I had wanted that ending I would have watched any teen romcom from the 90s. It was that exact same formula. Girl is finally happy where she started, everyone SUDDENLY loves her (those that labeled her Crazy Sookie...), and whaddaya know... her bff who has been right under her nose is the guy she ends up with.. but you know.. not in a crazy, passionate, spectacular way.. but because he's always been around. Yay?<br /><br />Honestly, I've read some bad books. But this made top 3. And the only reason it is upsetting me this much, is because I spent ten years following this supposedly \\"fun\\" series, recommending it to people, etc.<br /><br />And the way Harris is now treating her readers... is appalling. Making them out to be unhinged crazies is honestly low. These people have bought your books for YEARS. Have a little respect. As a successful author, you need to grow a pair when putting your work out there. I honestly find it surprising you can't take criticism. All I hear is you talking about hate and anger. When really.. it's betrayal and disappointment. And you won't even give these people the chance to air their opinions. Why do you even have a public forum and page? The biggest disappointment, I think, for the fans, has been your treatment of them., has been your treatment of them.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|If you're in IT, you need to read this book.  It opened our eyes and gave us tools for managing our project workflows.  I can't say enough good things about Gene Kim and his book.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The setting of Enland and Scandinavia in the middle ages is fascinating. Well written, well acted and directed. Fascinating historical drama
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|is simple, and easy to pass time away while waiting for something to occur.  This game is more for children
B0063GORYU|4.0|Once you win once or twice then you start liking to play it more and more. And the hours will melt away.
B009R659L8|5.0|I was sure I know what was going on and then I foundout I was all wrong.<br />Good summer read.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a beautifully written novel. The story is magical as well as disturbing in some parts.  There's a real opportunity to partake in a vibrant educational experience regarding flowers...and life.
0553801473|5.0|Never have I enjoyed a book or series of books as much as I have in reading the 'The Game of Thrones' series.  I have never read anything that draws one into the characters and makes you feel a part of the story as this series does.  You come to love every character, good or evil and you want to be a part of their lives.  This is one adventure that everyone should experience.  A Masterpiece of writing.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I downloaded this onto my Kindle. I had about 5min worth of playing time before I began having trouble with the program.<br /><br />I shut it all down & re booted the program. I tried doing this a couple of times & kept getting an error message from the app.<br /><br /> I have since deleted this off my device. I was never able to get back in to the app after the first 5 min. Too bad as it looked fun.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This is one of those cases where it's funny because it's true.  Great film worth a watch, but not with children around.  There are definitely some child inappropriate scenes.  So choose a good viewing time and enjoy!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I have been playing this game since I first saw the advertisement for it. It's a very good game when your bored. It also builds hand and I coordination.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!!!  Edward Norton is at his best in this role and Jessica Biel was so surprising!  I would highly recommend it!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|They cannot make a movie about these books.. NO MAN will ever fit the bill 100%.<br />Great read! I loved them all and have read them twice..
B004X6PRO6|5.0|An amazing look at the lives of the people of North Korean and the brutality of a dictatorship.  It makes you appreciate the USA even more.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved the way it was written, going back and forth on time, similar to Gone Girl, going back and forth with characters.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Explains how the 2008 recesion was fueled viewed from the point of view of the few guys who saw it coming and shorted the market derivatives that were in the root of the recesion. It is really well written, because while it gets inside financial details of the whole thing, Mr. Michael gets inside the lifes and characters of the guys who saw it coming AND ACTED on it. Great book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I cannot explain yet why I like this show so much. I just do. I am not typically a PBS watcher, nor am I a high society guy. I'm more of a Sons of Anarchy guy. (Yes, I ride a Harley.) However, there is something about Downton Abbey that resonates with me. Of course, the acting is superb and the setting is fabulous, but I don't think that explains it. Recently, I've become attracted to all things European. In other words, I'm pulling my head out of the American sand and looking around at what the rest of the world has to offer. I've switched to mostly European ales. I'm trying more European foods, not just Italian all the time (I'm a NYer - we're raised on Italian foods). We're planning a European trip next year. And so on. But again, I do not think these explain it. When I figure out what precisely is the reason, maybe I'll re-post. That may take a few more seasons, which I'll joyfully watch. Until then, I'll just assume that somewhere in my bloodline is royalty and that watching Downton is like coming home for me.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My sister is a big fan of the Harry Potter series. She loved this small condensed film-collection. It's easy for her to bring with her whenever she goes away for the weekend and the films are perfect quality.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|bleh theres a few laughs but this movie could have been a lot funnier. im not sure they tried too hard
B0027MJU00|4.0|But not as good.  I absolutely loved Gone Girl, and was hoping for a similar great book, but it was just okay.  A good read, but a bit disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like being able to read on the go. It is lightweight and easy to use anywhere, unlike paper books.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This was a surprise for me:  watched the pilot on a suggestion, and could not stop.  Somewhat violent for my taste, but, with that said, the performances are outstanding, all the way around.  I believe these characters.  Katy Segal is truly amazing as Gemma; and I like the soft side that they bring to Jax.  Looking forward to Season two.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I was stupid. It wasn't all that it was cracked out to be. I don't even get the movie. Maybe I was to drunk even though I dont drink. I did watch it twice once for here and once free on youtube. Just a hint most movies you can watch on youtube for free.
B0061PEAUY|1.0|Read several chapters and the story and writing style did nothing to engage my interest. I need five more words... silly Amazon
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I don't even know what to put because I cannot remember the movie it was so boring. I need three more words Hate It
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I live the game it is really fun and addicting when your bored its perfect the game is unique and interesting I LOVE it it makes my life  complete
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|All it was about was an alcoholic polit. I can watch that from my own family thank you. Not really. It was a great movie. Some action. Didn't need some sex seen's in it. Didn't make sense. I think they should of been up in the air longer to make the story more interesting. More people could of been hurt in the plan crash. I would of like to of seen blood and guts thats just me.<br />BY the way you can watch it on YouTube. Down load it off your Android Phone for free. There's an app and you can what this movie and not pay the fee.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be a great movie. It's a &#34;feel-good&#34; movie. Sundays need movies like this one. Definitely worth watching.<br /><br />It's a mix of dark comedy with chick-flick, but fun (come on, HF is in it).
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I should of listen to my heart and said a talking teddy bear movie would be stupid and sure enough I was right.<br />Also I found it on Youtube a day later for free so I felt stupid. Full feature good quality. If your going to watch movies download an app off google play store and watch them for free off youtube. Why waste your money.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|A true classic. If you enjoy movies, you'll love this. It is entertaining from start to finish and has a great twist
B0052AC8C6|4.0|The animation was fine, the story is good. It's nice to see a piece of animation that doesn't feel it has to be hyper real IN YOUR FACE WITH STORY AND EMOTION AND ANIMATION WOW all the time.<br /><br />Recommend
B00CM96A60|4.0|I wouldn't quite say this album brings much new to the table. It has 15 tracks (a great value!), and each one of them is at worst, very good. However, it's nothing I haven't heard before, and there aren't really any tracks that stand out to me. I would highly reccomend buying this disc, since it's a great value and it features a bunch of great tracks by a great producer. However, don't expect Intense to become your new favorite album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play minecraft on xbox and this is by far the best app i have for my kindle. basically just a condenced version. so much fun you will easily get your moneys worth within the first day of playing.
B002RRN952|4.0|Defiantly a good action movie if you are into this series. I would recommend it to anyone who likes futuristic movies.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|awesome movie. great actors. good songs. definitely is one of my favorite movies. Who doesn't love the Beatles or Jim Sturgess?
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|i play it more than any other game more than x box and play station pretty good i also like the con trails
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I ACCIDENTALLY DELETED IT NOOOOOOO!!!! IM SOOOOOO UPSET! i love this game now i have to start from scratch ughhhhhh! it took me 3 days to get to level 10 ughhhh!!!! get it ir regret it. trust me you'll love it!
B00AJAFNIA|3.0|Well this game is okay.<br /><br /> I don't get the point of this game cause your never gonna get to earth
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I was looking for a solution to extended usage hours while in transit and away from power sources. Frankly, I think the airplane seats should come equipped with power sources for recharging all our gadgets while we're stuck in one spot.<br />I haven't gone on my trip yet so I haven't made the ultimate test. But, I did test a fully charged Anker. I was successful charging the iPhone once, iPod twice and a tiny charge on the iPad. No device charges to 100% but they charge to 98% which works for me.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|very interesting, learning things I didn't know. Teaches you how to train your mind.  Teaches you how to understand about yourself.
B00BEYX7TW|4.0|we watched the movie inflight and it was pretty good. It takes abit to get into it, but  Ireally enjoyed it. Tommy Lee Jones is always good.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|The book is very practical and easy to relate to. I wish more women leaders would come out as Sheryl does and share from their hearts and allow others to learn from their experiences. Sheryl speaks from her heart and that is what makes the book so appealing.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I've seen this movie before and I enjoyed wastching it again. This is a fast paced and quick witted film.
193700788X|4.0|I'm going to miss Bon Temps.  The fictional town in Louisiana is just as much of a character as Eric, Sookie, Jason, and Bill in Harris' novels.  The connection between the regular folk is what grounds the series.  I just love that Michele brings over a casserole.  That is what people do.<br /><br />The author does a good job winding up the Supes' storylines.  Sookie ends up with with the only person that makes sense - someone that can live a life with her.  The only weak spot in the story is the tie up of the mystery.  She seemed to open a portal that in her previous books, was permanently closed.<br /><br />Thank you, Charlaine, for giving me a glimpse into such an amazing town.  I could live there, but only if there was a supply of Tru Blood available.
B005NGKMOU|3.0|In \\"Blackthorn\\" Sam Shepard plays \\"James Blackthorn,\\" a mysterious American who, having lived in Bolivia for nearly twenty years, decides to go back to where he came from. While preparing for his return, however, James loses everything - his horse and savings - because of a young Spanish mining engineer Eduardo Apodaca (Eduardo Noriega), who shoots at James \\"by mistake.\\"<br /><br />Set in the early 20th century, the film's story about a tired outlaw drawn into one more (and probably last) adventure is not particularly new, except one part. The outlaw in exile is in fact Robert Leroy Parker, better known as Butch Cassidy. While following the story of \\"James\\" and Eduardo, the film tells us in its intermittent flashback sequences what really happened to Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and Etta Place in South America.<br /><br />Spanish director Mateo Gil's film works better as a character study of James Blackthorn than as a western, with a beautiful on-location photography and charismatic Sam Shepard, who almost single-handedly carries the film. The main story of Eduardo and James, both pursued by a Bolivian industrialist's posse (overlapping the story of the George Roy Hill classic), is fairly entertaining, though it is slow-moving and often interrupted by flashbacks that are not really interesting. Not a bad film, not great either.
B009NG1Q96|1.0|I was intrigued and read the first book in a day.  This second one is terribad.<br /><br />The main character is pathetic, boring and fickle.  The book is a horrible high school drama that has her bounce from one manufactured drama to the next with little thought.  I kept waiting for it to be better... but clearly it's the #2 book in the new craze where authors do a 3 book series.  Sigh.  What pathetic action this book had could have been summarized in just a few sentences in a 3rd book.<br /><br />pathetic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was full if adventure and awsomeness it was so great I need the second book  I'm sad I have to buy them though
B001AQQR2S|3.0|As a movie, rates only 3 stars.  Equally, because of the many transmission breaks, it was less than enjoyable to watch.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I am a big Baldacci fan and this book is just another in a fantastic series of books by him.
B009EEGSDG|4.0|Nobody can own Danny Trejo, but the director sure tried. The choppy style of directing? producing? sucks, to say the least.  This movie gets a little bloody and the nude scenes add up to keeping this away from the under-15 crowd (PG-15?) but for the action-lover, go for it. Just be ready to roll your eyes and go with the flow with the stop action/quick-advance method of movie.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This &#34;diet&#34; plan seems more doable than most - and may even have real health benefits besides just losing weight.  Waiting to see results of more research.....
B00B19DW0E|5.0|How fun to watch this old dog hunt! Pre-zombie zombie-like flick with its goofy styles of that era, the horrendous snake &#34;tattoo&#34; on Kurt Russell, the &#34;bad guy&#34; attitudes of kurt and Van Cleef.  Yes, I'll watch it again!
1442359315|5.0|I'm a believer, but reading (hearing it, in my case) it really reinforces my faith.  When a scientist can explain the unexplainable as Dr A has done, it helps me understand that faith and science are indeed compatible.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a very long time. The history was very well researched.  The premise really raises some intriguing questions.
B0055S348W|2.0|I have had this item on my wish list for some time, waiting for the price to drop. When it finally did, I was poised to purchase, but decided to check the reviews one more time. Chastened by some recent frustrated Fire users, I went to the web page and downloaded the free version, so I could check to see if it would work with my printer. It located my wireless printer right away, but didn't have the driver (ALERT- there are NO drivers for Dell prnters). THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER if the website listed the compatable printers, instead of making us download the app and do trial and error. Listing the supported printers would also make it easier to check back for updates. As it is, I won't waste my time again to see if by chance they've discovered Dell. But I do encourage anyone considering this app to get the free version first and check it out. My guess is that its a pretty good printing app if you're one of the lucky one's it supports. Good luck.
B000FC10MU|5.0|I do like Neil Gaiman's work, (I'm biased) and this is a great example. Maybe not as accessible as Neverwhere or as sentimental as The Graveyard Book, this one is almost gritty. Visceral. I'm reminded of Hammet in some of the hard-boiled characters here. It was long enough to be truly satisfying, and racy enough to be a bit sorry I tried to read some parts on the train.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Great package for a great show.<br />Well worth the price.<br />Contains all episodes, movies and webisodes.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi, this show is awesome!
B007HACDLK|2.0|I'm sick of this genre - glorification of torture for 'national security', extra-judicial killings of slimy characters, double crossing assassins manipulated by caring, paternalistic spy chiefs. Flynn sounds like a damaged version of Ollie North, here. If this is his version of heroism, I'd rather we packed up the sniper rifles and left the oil where it is.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a book with doable exercises proving to oneself that accessing the &#34;Field&#34; ( Universe, God, Hologram, etc) is not hard.<br />And to top off that good news, Pam Grout shares with the reader, her fun approach to a serious ( for most ) subject , encouraging<br />the reader to jump right into these experiments with enthusiasm, a smile and anticipating results.<br />Brilliant really.<br />This is a book I will be gifting to friends and family.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|This is a funny movie the couple is very funny together. Not as funny as I was hoping it would be but still funny.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Very good movie with good effects.  it's an old plot, but wonderfully done with good acting.  The movie is very entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This series is very good, it leaves you wondering what it going to happen and every episode has a surprise.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Very well made for a series.  Each episode has good plots and carries on the story as a whole.  I would suggets this series to anyone but please start at the begining before you see this season if you havent been following along.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Now I definitely know what all the talk is about. This is a fantastic show. All of the acting is wonderful and I can't get enough of it. I do not get the BBC channel out here in the sticks where I live so the Amazon Prime membership is perfect for me to watch all the shows I love but never get to see on TV. Now with Amazon Prime I can watch through my PC in my bed room, my Wii on my Family Room TV, and my son has an internet ready TV that he can watch what he wants on. I love this show and I love love love my Amazon Prime membership.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|This movie is good but not great.  If you are in the mood for a somewhat predictable but entertaining movie, this is the movie for you.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|This is a fantastic series; my 16 year old so and I both love it. I do not get the BBC channel out here in the sticks where I live so the Amazon Prime membership is perfect for me to watch all the shows I love but never get to see on TV. Now with Amazon Prime I can watch through my PC in my bed room, my Wii on my Family Room TV, and my son has an internet ready TV that he can watch what he wants on.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|I am IN LOVE with this game. I have a kindle fire and I was really confused when it wouldn't let me play it and it kept saying &quot;Doodle God has stopped&quot;. But then I was riding the bus home (which means I had no WiFi) and it worked and when I got home (I had WiFi)  it still worked so I tried closing out of the app and going back in and it stopped working again. I turned off my WiFi and it worked. My point is, the game only works on kindle fire if u open the app while your WiFi is off. Once it's on and running then u can turn your WiFi on and it will still work. I just wanted to say that for everyone that's having problems with it. Try turning your WiFi off and see if it works.
B0064QNS62|5.0|Had a blast with this game on my Kindle Fire HD and my Grandsons love it also.  Mush have for some fun relaxing enterainment when you are not looking for something too heavy or a change of pace from reading a book.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Love smash season 1! It was so worth the purchase! I literally love the music, characters, story line, etc.! I would highly recommend!
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Now this film will amaze you.  I surely was impressed with the entire film and never found a dull moment.  The historical information coupled with the beauty of &#34;Karol's&#34; life story will amaze and delight anyone with a good heart.  It is a must see for every child and adult.  I surely enjoyed it and highly suggest you view it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I like it mostly, just rather repetitious. Know it's a story, but could use a little more of something. Good read, definitely different!
B0000549B0|5.0|This movie is fun, great for the whole family.  The acting is excellent, the plot is filled with funny moments and I do suggest that if you have never shown this to your children that you set aside some time for them to view it.  Jimmy Stewart shows off his marvelous talent as he is an actor to be admired and never forgotten.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We got this movie when my 5 year old nephew was visiting and it was a huge hit.  It's a sweet film with some laughs for everyone.  We recommend it.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|Excellent story, superior acting and great for the entire family.  In a world where life changes so fast it is great to expose the family to a glimpse of days gone by, as this film affords that opportunity I strongly recommend it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 18 month old daughter likes to play this game in short stints as does my 5 year old nephew.  There are lots of options so kids of different ages can approach it different.  It's a nice little occupier if you want something to keep their attention for 10 minutes at a time.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love the cd and will order another one,the package was great and the music was wonderful.Keep up the good work.
0399536108|4.0|I wish I had this book when I was in college. As a non-conformist that life has constantly tried to bend to its will, this book would have been the tiny bit of encouragement needed against a world of naysayers. I'm giving this book to at least two graduates this year.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I would recommend going back and reading the book either before or after viewing this stunning movie.  If the viewer misses the underlying message it would be a shame.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I personally am a longboarder and this is a awesome app I can just click it on my phone and boom! I see all the weather for anywhere I want.
030758836X|5.0|This novel leads you one way, then turns around and bites you in the butt.  Well written, incredible plot.  Couldn't put it down
B004UPALT6|5.0|Definitely one of the more fun movies for Saturday night in with friends. I have enjoyed this movie for many years, and I enjoy showing it to new friends who have not seen it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series so much I couldn't wait for it to finish on TV so I ordered the DVD and my sister and I literally stayed up all night and watched the whole thing.  It is torture waiting for more.
B00947N6D8|5.0|my child loves this movie and will watch it over and over and over again. Thank you very much. It is awesome.
B004LWZW4M|1.0|I was excited to get this movie, it arrived in perfect condition. the price was great, BUT sadly the movie it's self sucked.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|These books were awesome. I've seen the three movies and loved them as well.  I should have read them first because somethings are missing in the movies. I wished there was more information about her twin so that there could have been more closure.  Overall the books were well written and I gave them five stars.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun. Good way to waste time. Not overly easy or extremely hard. And it doesn't drain your battery likr crazy either.
0143122916|5.0|I've always been interested in true stories from all cultures around the globe. I've been especially interested in South & North Korea when I started practicing Tae Kwon Do years ago. I had heard the story about a man who had not only been a prisoner who escaped North Korea but had actually been born into a prison there. I came across the book on Amazon while in the process of ordering another excellent book &#34;Eyes Of The Tailless Animals&#34; Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman by Soon Ok Lee.  &#34;Escape From Camp 14&#34; is one of the most shocking stories of human survival I have ever encountered. What Shin Dong-hyuk had to endure as a prisoner is absolutely shocking & something so brutal that no human being or animal should have to suffer through! This man & all other prisoners wre treated worse than abused animals & being born in a prison, he had no conception of the outside world. Not only is his story of living as a prisoner & eventually learning of a life beyond the prison walls & escaping remarkable but now his adjusting to a world where emotions can be expressed is unbelievable! They weren't even able to show any emotion without punishment! It is truly a heart wrenching & courageous story of one man's journey to freedom & is a must read for everyone in the free world! This inhumane treatment must end now!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I was skeptical, at first, about this book, but now im hooked! I read this book on a whim, mostly because I had read everything else that was on my list and this was the first book that came up when I asked a forum about new books to read. Usually, I do a lot of research into the books (and authors) I read before purchasing them, but I took a chance with this one, and it was phenominal! I was a little disappointed that the next book in the series has yet to be released, though., because I am now waiting on pins and needles until I can buy it. Im even debating pre-ordering the book in hardback, even though I have been exclusively reading on my kindle for three years now.
B000GX05RO|5.0|This book is one of my bibles, considering how my perception has been cleansed these are words to live by
B005CRQ3H0|5.0|Pynchon serves up So Cal in mid century with an interesting Doc and other characters. Reminiscent of Oedipa Maas with another level/type of conspiracy along with fascinating groups.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I like how easy it is to use and sounds great, nice choice of music ,my grandchildren Luke it to !
B005JE1KHE|4.0|This was perfect holiday reading. Not to heavy and easy to read with an absorbing story line. You sympathised with several of the characters and the wolf was the star.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|Changed from LOOKOUT primarily based on  various Android bloggers reviews of being more efficient and use on windows platform which I also like.  So far all my mobile devices(4) operate the same as before the switch and definitely not worse.  Haven't had any of the protection functions activate and hope it is working as claimed.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I got the app over a year ago to run on kindle fire and it worked great. However since the upgrade I will receive random pop ups advising it is unable to run and I must click to force close. Restarting kindle usually clears it but then it returns in a couple days.
0811729117|5.0|I bought this for my husband, who loves history. He feels like he is sitting on the Stammtisch with the officer and listens to him telling his story. Great price, fast delivery
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie makes you believe in the power of faith. The way this true story is depicted is amazing. Highly recommended
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Every layout runs out of open tiles too soon and repeatedly after that. Otherwise a very good game.  Notice of need to shuffle is so small and out of the line of sight that you loose too much time looking for matches where  there aren't any.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|When I heard they were making Thor, my mind flashed to his incarnation in the 1980s TV movie &#34;The Return of the Incredible Hulk.&#34;  That wasn't bad for its time, but this is absolutely incredible.  If you like super heroes, you'll love this.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Loved the series but hated this cliffhanger.  There better be another book!!!  I will be looking forward to another one coming out soon.
B0015T6G2G|3.0|Interesting story but too detailed for my reading.  It was too political for my personal interest, but still a book to recommend.
193700788X|1.0|I must say up front that I found the last two or three books to be a big disappointment.  While the plots were mildly entertaining, it felt like we were being told a story rather than shown a world in which we could lose ourselves.  I have grown increasingly less invested in the characters, and by the time I got to this last book, I almost just wanted it to be over.  While I'd hoped to be pleasantly surprised, I instead was horrified at how downright awful this book ended up being.<br /><br />There is not one interesting turn of events in this book.  Same old story of poor Sookie can't get her love life straight, and meanwhile, half a dozen people want her dead.  She almost gets killed, but of course gets saved at the last minute.  The end.  Oh, but wait.  Ms. Harris also felt the need to include the original HEA romantic ending she supposedly intended from the beginning, despite the fact that the series evolved in ways I'm sure she didn't anticipate, as did her loyal and supportive fan base.  Sometimes you gotta give the people what they want.  Instead, Ms. Harris took a huge dump all over Sookie, and all over her readers.  I'm disappointed beyond belief, but I can't say I'm totally surprised.  I called this ending several books back, but I hoped I was wrong.  Sadly, I was spot on.<br /><br />Ms. Harris needs to retire from writing books, because her prose has degenerated into something akin to listening to an aunt at a potluck tell a story about a third cousin you met once back in third grade.  You catch every fifth word or so, while looking around the room hoping for something more interesting to come up and waiting impatiently for her to shut up already.  Fortunately, Aunt Harris has finished her rambling monologue.  And we can all hope that Alan Ball does something much more interesting with the time he has left with these characters we (used to, at least) love/hate/otherwise actually find interesting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a great game, this has become my babysitter, my daughter loves this game, she can play it for hours and hours, I will rate this as a 5 star just because their is not a higher rating.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Better than other bingo  games.  Should have a feature to buy bingo credits with $ earned.  Not all the time but randomly.  Have tons of $ and will never be able to spend it all.

B009GX7IRA|5.0|I've seen every episode. the storyline flows perfectly and i don't feel like i'm missing something between seasons or episodes. absolutely the best show on tv. and i love the fact amazon has the episodes to download, i'm currently serving overseas in afghanistan.
B00B4W8AIW|5.0|If you are a fan of the first album you will like this one as well.  All the songs are solid.
B001JIDE3M|4.0|The only reason i love this movie so much is because Josh Hutcherson is totally amazing and so funny. Really a good movie - better than the second, i would say.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|I saw this many years ago in the theatre when it was released and brought back great memories.  The concert footage is great of the best rock band ever.  Jimmy Page's solos are unreal they all were so young but the talent that they all had shows through.  A must have for the Zeppelin fan.
B00006LIRI|4.0|I would really like for U2 to have a CD with their greatest hits on it.  Some of these songs are not familiar to me.  I really like a couple of the songs, but was kind of disappointed that their best songs I'm familiar with did not seem to be included.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I bought this set of DVDs without seeing any of the shows on TV and now I'm hooked on The Vampire Diaries.  It is great with a lot of twists and turns to keep your interest up, not to mention some really good-looking characters.  I will probably get all the season sets available.  The seller did very well at sending the product on time in good shape.

193700788X|2.0|The words of Sam...\\"That's pretty convoluted\\"...sums up the whole book. It didn't seem like a worthy ending to a long series. CH squeezed every former character into the book. Even Debbie Pelt. No real storyline. Just regurgitated all the old storylines into one novel. The sex scene in Ch. 20 was LAME. Even worse than \\"50 Shades\\". BTW, Karin Slaughter might be a child of Eric's, but she's also a writer. Look her up. She's pretty good.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'm not sure why people are complaining about the things they are about this app. I can play it without wifi and play it while using other apps on my kindle. you have the option of pressing stop before exiting the app and no longer have it play when you go to the home page. people seem to always complain before actually trying to fix a so called &quot;problem&quot;. This app is wonderful and as one other person stated you can layer the sounds and adjust the volume for each individual sound. I have never had an issue with it stopping while in standby mode and in fact its fantastic for that reason if you're using this as a sleep aid. I highly reccomend this app to anyone who loves the sounds of nature and or mild sounds to just help you zone out. I use this app even while at work and doing surgery to help relax me. I've also noticed patients enjoy the soothing noises as well.

B0031RS2HC|3.0|Poorly written and not a very plausible or engaging story.  I was bored, and disappointed by the end of it
B0084IG7KC|4.0|when the hunger games played theaters in march it posted the biggest opening in history for a movie released outside of summer. while there is no direct correlation between box office success and quality, the numbers are worth reporting, especially the hunger games is a blockbuster that is actually good. truth told 2012 has been an excellent year for blockbuster movies. the avengers and the dark knight rises also boast a nice mix of quality spectacle and audience approval, but it was the hunger games that got the ball rolling. as impressive as the box office totals are, they probably weren't a surprise to fans of suzanne collins' hunger games novels. the books are breakout hits in multiple countries, meaning the movie reached theaters with a built in audience. the hunger games is the first entry in collins' three story set, which takes place in panem, a post apocalyptic version of north america. the country comprises a wealthy capital city and 12 poverty stricken districts. as penance for past rebellion, each district is forced to sacrifce one boy and one girl to and annual gladiator like contest known as the hunger games. the contest is televised much like today's reality tv programs, but the stakes are much higher than survivor or the bachelor. in this game show, the contestants fight to the death.<br /> the heroine of the film is katniss everdeen (jennifer lawerence) a smart athletic 16 year old who volunteers for the games as a replacement for her meek younger sister, who was chosen by lottery. as the movie progresses, director gary ross (seabiscuit and pleasentville) walks viewers through katniss' journey, step by step. first, the contestants are treated like celebrities as they're trotted onto talk shows for all of panem to see. then, they get a brief introduction to combat and survival skills before being thrown into a massive outdoor arena where they must fight each other and number of artificially constructed dangers.<br /><br />two sequels are planned in this series and this one is worth picking up and watching. if you have not seen it get this movie. if you have read the books get the movie. this movie is worth gettinghis series and this one is worth picking up and watching. if you have not seen it get this movie. if you have read the books get the movie. this movie is worth getting
B004D20JP2|3.0|It was a cute movie in my mind.  It is silent and all with what I think is clay animation.  The characters move in a &#34;jerky&#34; format and their eyes are very wide, which scared my daughter and couldn't watch it.  Good music.  I was hoping the silent movie with classical music would make for a nice relaxing movie before bed...not so much unfortunately
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|American Horror Story is an amazing thrill ride that never ceases to amaze. The underlying plot lines and twists always surprise. You never can tell if you know what is going on for sure, or not. When they reveal the true story, the shock will keep you enthralled until the very last second. Love the cameos from stars that you would never expect. The history that is included to give the story deep roots makes you feel like this could actually happen, and draws you in deeper.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show if you are looking for something new and exciting to mix things up and get out of that sitcom rut. Can't wait for the second season to get underway.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building Your Book for Kindle by Amazon starts with the contents, but instead of just some vague innuendos of what’s to come, its broken down like many writers break down a subject they are going to write a book about.  The organization will greatly impress you if you are like most writers, whose heads are so full of dreams that they have trouble finding two shoes that match in their own closet.<br />The contents also make it easier to find things when you get back to what you were doing after being interrupt by (Choose one; Spouse or Significant Other, children, yours and or those belonging to others, the fire dept, the bank, the landlord, the head hunter trying to get you a real job, the boss, if you’re lucky enough to have one, your in laws that dropped in and stayed two weeks, etc.).<br />Next you move into the first chapter and again, everything is laid out perfectly.  The hierarchy of ideas is followed by easy advice on how to accomplish each step with the kind of precision you generally only see in computer programming algorithms.<br />One of the most important things this book does is help you make all the little decisions and give you links to find information if you are not sure what you are deciding is a little decision, especially when it comes to details.<br />This book not only tells you how to format, but WHAT NOT TO DO WITH FORMATTING!  The first book I published on Amazon began with six blank pages because I left three blank lines for emphasis.  Reading this book first will save hours of work reformatting or rewriting because you used a word processing program nobody publishes in, like Xywrite or Ventura Publishing.<br />When you are writing an eBook there is no publisher to provide you with an editor to correct your mistakes and guide you through the process, but this book is probably packed with more experience and tips than you’d get from five editors, so it is well worth your time to read!  And several years after publishing your eBook you will have written another book and will again need help getting it set up online all over again, so keep this with all your writers’ references.will have written another book and will again need help getting it set up online all over again, so keep this with all your writers’ references.

I think Bach made some of the most perfect music ever!Its here on Amazon.
B009NY43NY|1.0|All I have to say is that it was terrible. I'm a huge fan of the series, even as the books have become increasingly poorly written. There is, however, no excuse for this sloppy excuse for a book. This opinion has nothing to do with the ending for I never cared about who she would end up with, I just enjoyed her adventures. No, this was the worst book ive read by far, and I read quite a lot. It was like she forgot who every character was, and then shoved them all in there even if it made no sense. Terrible, Ms. Harris<br />.
193700788X|1.0|This book was such a disappointment.  Harris wasted time on way too many boring details as well as ended the series with the lamest ending. Yes Sam has been there the entire time, but there has never been much of an attraction there and he lives in a trailer behind a bar, very sexy.  Somehow I knew all along Harris would write them ending up together and I was nervous to read the last book to find out.<br /><br />How could Harris end with the bad guys winning?  Sookie would have fought for Eric or vice versa, instead he just left?  Such a built between them over so many books...then it just flops?  That is not true to their characters as Harris says.  The ending to the book was such a disappointment I wish I take back reading it and make up my own Happily Ever After.  Thanks to Harris for creating Sookie, I have looked forward to the books coming out each year but she really ruined the entire experience by ending it so poorly...almost as bad as the ending to the Hunger Games series.

B001G9F9IW|2.0|POOR PRODUCT EXPERIENCE<br />(1) Title Arrived In  Damaged Packaging (2) Blu Ray Picture Quality Was No Better Than DVD<br />I recently gave away my DVD copy of Vicky Cristina Barcelona, with the hope of upgrading to a Blu Ray, given the gorgeous locations and colors in the film. Jumped at the first great deal that came along on Amazon. But to my dismay, the Blu Ray copy turned out out to be a real disappointment.<br /><br />(1) Firstly, the title arrived in a badly damaged packaging with a deep gash running through the plastic jewel-case, as if it had been deliberately disfigured for disposal (perhaps marked as &#34;not for sale item&#34;, perhaps a pirated copy) yet somehow found its way into the legitimate channel. Perhaps it was a pirated disc that was somehow resold. THIS SPEAKS TO THE QUALITY CONTROL THAT AMAZON DOES ABOUT ITS PRODUCTS, AND ALSO THE QUALITY OF ITS SUPPLIERS.<br /><br />(2) Upon playing this gorgeous movie, my experience seemed all to familiar. The picture quality was just about the same as it was with my previous DVD which btw looked great given its format (and had great packaging too). I REGRET GIVING UP MY EXCELLENT DVD COPY OF VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA FOR THIS UTTERLY CRAPPY BLU RAY VERSION.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Admittedly, it had a very slow start. I hated Emma, and found it rather difficult to stick with her for more than a few chapters at a time.

I was beaming by the end! A lovely book.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|Adam Johnson deserved the Pulitzer for The Orphan Master’s Son.  We view the story through Jun Do (John Doe), a character that takes us on his journey from an orphanage, fighting in the dark tunnels under the DMZ, to being a radio surveillance operator on a fishing boat getting a tattoo of North Korea’s famous actress, to America where he meets a Senator and a CIA operative and back to North Korea with a new identity as a replacement husband not initially understanding love, hope and freedom.  The orphan master, is it either his literal father or North Korea, is a hard taskmaster in this totalitarian nation where the threat of violence, torture, imprisonment and disappearing is always around. Country before self is dominant; propaganda is rampant; fear is everywhere. We see the harshness of Kim Jong Il and his regime juxtaposed against glimpses of humanity. The author showed us that it possible to retain one’s own identity and take fate into one’s own hand.<br /><br />The book has three narrators.  There is a third person providing the background of Jun Do is Part I in addition to the propaganda broadcasted by loudspeaker to all citizens all day long telling the “beautiful” story of a national hero, Commander Ga, whose story is “told” in Past II, married to the famous actress and the first person account of the benevolent interrogator who writes the biographies of the accused before wiping their brains trying to understand why people did what they did.<br /><br />While there are many tense scenes in this coming-of-age, romantic, adventurous political thriller and as harsh as some of the violence is, it is it is a page turner.

0618918248|4.0|&#34;As ever when we unweave a rainbow, it will not become less wonderful.&#34;<br /><br />As I kicked off a second reading of Richard Dawkins' 2006 chart-buster, I was reminded of a secondhand conversation to which I was privy at a (now-obsolete) home electronics store. A slick-haired, middle-aged man stands a few paces away, clearly fixated by the latest inventory of high-definition televisions. As a store clerk approaches the shopper remarks, &#34;You ever wonder how it all works? I mean this is just...wow.&#34;<br /><br />The clerk, as if being tested on his knowledge of the trade, seizes the moment with avidity, launching into a monologue on the mechanics of flat panel operation. (Paraphrasing): &#34;Well, sir, you can direct a cold cathode light source, such as a fluorescent lamp, through a light shutter made up of pixels coated with tiny precision filters and get color images that way, as in the case of an LCD monitor, or you can discharge electricity through pixels filled with a rare gas mixture and watch as color phosphors are stimulated to produce visible light. We call the second type a plasma displ-.&#34;<br /><br />The glassy-eyed patron, with all the disinterest he can muster, interrupts, &#34;Oh I'd rather not know. Takes some of the magic out of it.&#34;<br /><br />Mystery, of course, allows the imagination to run wild. Absent a mechanistic explanation for a video monitor, a shooting star, an earthquake or, say, the appearance and evolution of life on earth, our minds latch onto those ideas we find most intuitive or comfortable, be it magic, mysticism or other notions of our own devising. Before we located better answers, we were quite content attributing weather, disaster, war, famine, constellations and star movements, migratory patterns and the rest to divine agency. For much of our early history &#34;God&#34; was the placeholder for human ignorance.<br /><br />Fast forward to present day, and we see that the lineaments reaped by modern society (like the HDTV) were borne out of a firm unwillingness to accept these default, untested answers and an insatiate thirst for deeper understanding. It was this aggrandizing spirit of discovery through which science was born. The process of replacing supernatural causality with natural causality is one that continues to this day. As God has been pushed further and further into obscurity by the never-stagnant march of science, does that, by extension, make God a delusion? Has our wealth of knowledge elbowed God out of the cosmic arena? Richard Dawkins believes so.<br /><br />To borrow his own phrase, Dawkins has been a &#34;consciousness-raiser&#34; for all things science, and is among the most distinguished practitioners living today. His work in gene-centric approaches to evolution and original ideas on memetic theory have spawned fresh avenues of research. Like many scientists, Dawkins' quest to deconstruct reality has not diminished the grandeur of the cosmos but rushed in a deeper intimacy and awe. And in doing so, he believes science has drawn the curtain back far enough to declare God a giant fallacy wrapped in a cocoon of faith and religions mere vestiges of earlier ignorance.<br /><br />Gods and Goddesses<br /><br />In his 2006 meisterwerk The God Delusion, based on his earlier documentary The Root of All Evil?, Dawkins assumes a two-pronged approach: he seeks to demonstrate first the untruth of revealed religion and secondly its detriment to society. In consonance with other atheist literature, his thesis is that supernatural gods almost certainly do not exist and that society would be better off without the religions that have congealed around themf.<br /><br />Of all the &#34;New&#34; Atheists, Dawkins tends to attract the most flack, both from the theist camp as well as from some of his co-thinkers (Frans de Waal comes to mind). This may be connected to the fact that he is the most publicly visible, or it might simply be due to his expressing views particularly controversial to American ears. Whatever the case may be, his scientific prowess and nigh immortal ability to convey scientific concepts through rhythmic prose cannot be denied.<br /><br />Those put off by his public persona may find themselves wooed into acquiescence, lost in his literary gait. However cantankerous Dawkins may seem while perched on a stage, his writing reflects a decidedly more even-handed, sometimes even glancingly humorous scientist trying sincerely to get at the truth. Sure, some of the adjectives he throws around in reference to religion may be a bit undiplomatic, but that is only to be expected given the bottomless rabbit hole of religious ruminations. Overall, I found his approach equitable and well thought out, as will be customary to anyone familiar with Dawkins' craft.<br /><br />He makes clear at the starting gate the conception of God he is challenging in this book: &#34;a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us.&#34; (p. 31) This subsumes not only theistic ideas of God but deistic versions as well. As the chapters unfold, he frequently narrows in on the Abrahamic triumvirate of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.<br /><br />While Dawkins may not be blind to the psychological utility of religion or its merit as a moral motivator, he is above all concerned with whether or not it is true. And it is in this vein that the first half of the book positions itself. Dawkins engages many of the popular arguments in favor of God's existence (while satirizing a few of the spectacularly weak ones), laying each of them to rest or at least exposing their glaring flaws.<br /><br />As a specialist in biology, he reserves the greatest expositional force for dismantling the argument from design. With characteristic lucidity he explains how Darwin's bold idea completely upended the design argument once and for all. Exercising Daniel Dennett's analogical idea of cranes and skyhooks, Dawkins remarks, &#34;Natural selection is the champion crane of all time.&#34; (p. 73) Unlike the top-down, skyhook hypothesis of a designer, evolution by natural selection is a gradated, bottom-up process where genetic configurations can only be understood post hoc. Dawkins stresses repeatedly that natural selection is not driven by chance but by fitness. He then concludes that while natural selection and design are alternatives, only the former is actually an explanation (since the latter merely regresses it) and more importantly, is the only one of the two buttressed by evidence. With descent by modification, one could hardly ask for an idea which more handily routs the chronic refrain of religious creation myths.<br /><br />In response to the cosmological version of the design argument, that of a finely tuned universe, Dawkins brandishes the familiar one-two stroke of the anthropic principle and Rees' multiverse hypothesis. Whether a non-natural agency existing outside of space and time or swarms of buzzing universes is a more satisfactory explanation of the facts may largely be a subjective verdict, especially considering that both currently occupy the same threshold of evidence: zero. At any rate, given what once was ascribed to God and later dislodged by science, Dawkins asks what possible reason could we have for thinking &#34;God did it&#34; will win out here?<br /><br />Prayer and NOMA<br /><br />Considering how many prayers are pitched to the skies each day as devotees inveigle their deity of choice to accomplish some change in the world, we might expect to find observable results validating these efforts. To date there have been several well-controlled, double-blind studies on the efficacy of prayer. In each of these studies, the null hypothesis was confirmed (i.e., prayer was shown to have no effect on patient condition). As Dawkins points out, one of the largest and most significant of these studies was funded by the Templeton Foundation, which of course was trying to prove the opposite. Templeton solicited Christian petitioners across America and provided them with the first name and last initial of 1,802 patients to pray for. The whole unctuous charade lasted for months, and the results were published in the American Heart Journal in April 2006. No relationship observed.<br /><br />Faced with a vacuum of evidence, many religionists take a different approach. Rather than aimlessly looking for something concrete, they resort to the notion of NOMA (non-overlapping magisteria). Popularized by Gould and swiftly picked up by apologists everywhere, it is the idea that science and religion occupy entirely separate domains of reality. Essentially, science operates in the facts sphere, while religion functions in the realm of values, and never the twain shall meet. This conceptual apparatus conveniently renders God immune to the scientific method. But as Dawkins illustrates with the multi-million dollar Templeton study, religion is quick to embrace science when there is but a slight chance the evidence may fall in its favor. This clearly indicates that &#34;NOMA is only popular because there is no evidence to favour the God Hypothesis.&#34; (p. 59)<br /><br />On several occasions he lends an ear to more sophisticated theologians, though he does not tread around them lightly. He gestures toward more rigorous ripostes to his arguments, but ultimately decries them as fantastical. According to Dawkins, the (Christian) theologian's appetency to allegorize the more troublesome and contradictory bits of the Bible and insert dreamed up concepts in their stead amounts to nothing more than arbitrary speculation. One could discern the zealous fans of Harry Potter and other fan fiction who dispute every minute detail of their revered lore as being not too distinct from the theologians of today, whose armchair musings fall on the deaf ears of the congregations of America. In the end, Dawkins says the constructions of modern theology are &#34;just shamelessly invented.&#34; (p. 35)<br /><br />The Roots of Religion<br /><br />Following his competent disassembly of the God hypothesis, he moves on to probing more underlying questions: Where did religious beliefs come from; if patently false, why are they still around? I found this section of secondary interest and feel he devoted a bit too much space to what essentially was a lot of speculation. He attempts to weave his pet memetic theory into a quasi-evolutionary explanation for the survival of religion into modernity, with moderate success. I think the psychological and emotional utility of religious beliefs are sufficient to explain their lasting power on human culture. That's not to say Dawkins' exploration here isn't worthwhile or interesting.<br /><br />Do We Need God to Be Good?<br /><br />Easily my favorite section of the book is &#34;The Roots of Morality&#34;, where Dawkins deciphers the riddle of ethics and morality. While he harbors no illusions that science can help us discern right from wrong (contra-Sam Harris), he argues that our capacity for doing so indeed has a scientific explanation. First, the pillars of empathy and reciprocal altruism are traits readily observable across the animal kingdom. This governing sociality, moreover, is most predominant in the higher primates, just as we would predict. Under an evolutionary view of life, then, it is no stretch to say that such cooperative attributes were biologically and later culturally selected for as an avenue towards greater fitness. If true, this would mean that basic decency codes and what we today call moral behavior long anticipated religion.<br /><br />Even if one doesn't find a Darwinian ontology compelling, Dawkins argues that the religious alternatives have no merit whatsoever. A Celestial Watchman and binary afterlife are typically heralded as motivators for good and, inversely, repressors for evil. In response, Dawkins has this to say, in what might be the single most poignant passage in the book:<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />&#34;If there is no god, why be good?<br /><br />&#34;As Einstein said, `If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.' Michael Shermer, in The Science of Good and Evil, calls it a debate stopper. If you agree that, in the absence of God, you would `commit  robbery, rape, and murder,' you reveal yourself as an immoral person, `and we would be well advised to steer a wide course around you.' If, on the other hand, you admit that you would continue to be a good person even when not under divine surveillance, you have fatally undermined your claim that God is necessary for us to be good. I suspect that quite a lot of religious people do think religion is what motivates them to be good, especially if they belong to one of those faiths that systematically exploits personal guilt.<br /><br />&#34;It seems to me to require quite a low self-regard to think that, should belief in God suddenly vanish from the world, we would all become callous and selfish hedonists, with no kindness, no charity, no generosity, nothing that would deserve the name of goodness.&#34; (p. 226-227)<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />In short, a conscience is not so easily discarded. The humanistic view, rather, is the view that people are fully capable of knowing right from wrong and do not need childish incentives to act ethically toward our fellow brothers and sisters. Human solidarity, empathy and the lessons derived from social experience account well enough for moral behavior. This Dawkins regards as the more adult moral psychology. In contrast, an ethic that even in implication is dependent upon eternal punishment as a demotivator for bad behavior seems to me to be the deficient one.<br /><br />Of equal importance to our justification for goodness (why be moral) is the epistemological (what is moral). Christians often wonder, `For people who don't regard the Bible as the Word of God, from where do they get their morals?' Dawkins showcases with great effectiveness the ethical flimsiness of the Abrahamic holy books, visiting a sampling of the Bible's problematic narratives and itemizing the divine prescripts that not even the most ardent men and women of faith follow. We all separate the virtuous bits from the primitive barbarism. How do we do this, Dawkins asks? By filtering them through our own ethical intuitions. The very fact that each of us passively edits these texts tells us that wherever our moral sense comes from, we are all tapping into the same source.

It is not eternal, nor is it absolute, but is constantly being refined and improved.<br /><br />The closing sections of the book Dawkins devotes to the dangers of dogmatic religious faith, which is really a dispraisal of fundamentalism in all its forms.

B0035Q4AFC|5.0|You know the movie and song entitled &#34;That's Entertainment&#34;?  Well, Charlie Chaplin WAS Entertainment and Robert Downey Jr. is once again absolutely BRILLIANT.  That man is the best of the best!
B005LAII8K|4.0|I wish I had seen it on the big screen, I really enjoyed this film great job, actually wish it was a little longer. Kinda like my review.
B009O07NDY|3.0|I am bit disappointed. A lot of the music is a copy of Lord of the Rings. They don't even have the dwarf song from the movie.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|As much as I like Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds, this was better. Christoph Waltz and Sam Jackson were amazing. It's a.Tarantino film, it's going to be violent and graphic, of course. It's also fun and very witty.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting and plot moved along quickly. I liked the way it went from the past to the present. &#34;The Distant Hours&#34; is still Morton's best but this was also a good read.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|For the life of me I cannot understand a single criticism of this album. I first heard it yesterday and was completely blown away. So much so that I've listened to it all the way through 4 more times since then. Let me say for the record that I am a big fan of his earlier work as well but I would easily say that this is better. I don't really have anything else to say. This album is perfect. Every song is an absolute delight.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|An all around great game played through it and started over multiple times here and on a droid phone they have continually add things to it over the past year which has in ways made it better and worse depending on your ability to be patient with a game and not beat it or max out in hours
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I got hooked after the first episode, and have watched all three seasons.  Can't wait for the new season to begin.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My 8yo daughter loves playing this game.  It presents enough challenge and spatial engineering concepts appropriate for this age group.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|this work is written with the reverence of &#34;spirit of many men who never envisioned anything but self interest&#34;.  I learned that wisdom of Lincoln was a gift he shared with &#34;any man&#34;.  I grew to appreciate the passion and simplicity of the time. thank you for penning the words.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Great characters. beautiful love story. a love story which is brought to life with an intense journey of two lovers and kindred souls. storyline flows beautifully. Loved it immensly.
1592407889|4.0|I use to so admire Shirley MacLaine!  I thought she was a very good actress; but I am one who equates personal to professional.  If your personal life is morally dispicable then I cannot in good faith think that you are a good person.  Based on the desciption given by Mrs. Parker, Mrs. MacLaine was one of the worst parents on the planet (right next to that pedophile of a husband; Mrs. Parker lying dad) and me being a Social Work they would both be in jail for abuse and neglect.  They were absolutely awful to their daughter and grandchildren.  OMG! I would never allow Mrs. MacLaine to be around or alone with my children and it would take a great deal of therapy for me to have a relationship with her.  She seems to be self-absorbed, mentally confused and should not have had a child at all. It is a miracle that Mrs. Parker came out to have any sense of integrity and/or standards because she absolutely did not get any from her parents or family (including her non-concerned uncle Warren Beatty; what type of family dynamics was that?????????).  Overall this book was a great read, informative and an eye-opener on celebrity parental skills (or lack there-of).
B002NJWHHA|2.0|The movie does not do the book justice. It is a shame that a better producer and screen writer did not pick up the series. With new technology the movie could have been outstanding. Read the book and skip the movie until it is redone
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very interesting information about the glycemic index and many related woes. My husband and I are trying the no-wheat lifestyle and so far, so good. It has been a month now and we are eating many more fresh foods and lots more protein. Both of us are sleeping like rocks and have plenty of energy all day. Is this all about eliminating wheat, or is it a combo of better diet choices to take the place of sandwiches and pasta? Not sure, but I'll keep at it. BTW--I would have given this book five stars if I did not have to read it a second time. Pretty complicated in parts, although the stories and humor really help make the medicine go down. Read it and think about it. Seems to make sense.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard many people talking about this show and I finally decided to watch it.  I devoured the first two seasons and had to buy this one.  Excellent story with historical significant and extremely good acting. Worth every minute.
B008ROG1QI|5.0|It's a fantastic war movie. I enjoyed the cast selection. It's a well told true story from world war two.
0843135697|5.0|My twin grandchildren love the Mr. Men and Little Miss books and have almost all of them. They are cute stories that teach important life lessons.
B00B7FWWNA|2.0|Who really wants 2 c Helen hunts all together. Come on she's not that impressive naked good actress when she has the right kind of script though.
0843175028|5.0|My twin grandchildren love the Mr. Men and Little Miss books and have almost all of them. They are cute stories that teach important life lessons.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|You can't go wrong with the weather channel.  It is always a good app to have.  One never knows when a severe weather alert will come up.  I would recommend this to everyone.
0843174218|5.0|My twin grandchildren love the Mr. Men and Little Miss books and have almost all of them. They are cute stories that teach important life lessons.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|First time using notebooks.  Like the idea of creating books for different things.  Using it for work.  Still learning the different things that I can do with it.  I would recommend this app.
0312370849|5.0|This book kept me reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open. I had to get to the end. As all holocaust stories, it is very sobering. But I feel it is essential reading for the good of society.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great! Use this all the time.  Really think it is great. Have already told people about it.<br />Will keep using it almost everyday.
B0078X2LKY|1.0|I purchased this to read in the Kindle app I have installed on my laptop but it can only be opened on Kindle devices.  Luckily I was able to et a refund.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great App and update weather.  Fast and informative weather local and national.<br />Will tell friends about this site.  Use it everyday.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|One of the best movie musicals of all time.  Barbra is amazing, Omar is charming.  This is a true classic.  Everyone who loves musicals should watch this.
B007RQ6WCA|4.0|Works great with standard camera roll from ipad to PC, but not well with other programs such as iFiles. You also have to manually select every single file every time to paste into Dropbox, which is time consuming. They really need to add a 'select all' button to make this sing.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun game.  Had trouble finding it on my Kindle when I downloaded it.  Had to do it twice before it finally took
B0053O89XI|5.0|it came in new condition witch made me very satified and it also came pretty quick so that also was good and it came with a digital copy code. I watch it almost every day.
0307476073|3.0|After reading the jacket of this book I was intrigued. I, like most people in life, have had my fair share of struggles. I am always inspired to hear of people that find great strength in adversity. While it is clear that Ms. Strayed has talent as a writer, her character is questionable at best. It is very hard to root for a person when you cannot respect them. (Warning: spoilers). I immediately noticed how self-absorbed she is. Many people write autobiographical stories and do not come off in that manner. She has a \\"poor me\\" attitude and an excuse for everything. It's one thing to own up to your mistakes and another to make excuses for them. Her mother died. It was horrible. I imagine it was terribly painful, but how long is she going to use that as an excuse for irresponsible behavior? I finally hit my limit during the section on the death of her mother's horse. What kind of a person allows an animal to suffer like that? Not to mention an animal that her mother loved dearly. She said more than once that she could not afford an injection from the vet to have the horse humanely euthanized. Was she trying to convince the reader or herself? She and her family combined could not pay for an injection? Really? That entire passage made me sick.<br /><br />What was missing from this book? Ms. Strayed's ability to own her choices in life. Her hike through the PCT gave her muscles and confidence, not the ability to be introspective.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Pros, sturdy case have had no problems with case. Cons,would be nice if I was able to charge kindle fire while  using kindle in upright  horizontal  position. Overall good price.
0375869026|5.0|I bought this for my grandson, but decided to read it first myself. He is eight and I decided to wait a year or two before giving it to him.<br />I really enjoyed it and I think it is a good story for kids to read and learn from and think about.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|My daughters and I have just started watching this series on the recommendation of a friend. We all love it! So many issues to talk about.... Money & economic class differences, fitting in, being yourself, mean girls, etc. We are only five episodes in & we've laughed, cried, cheered, and have become really attached to the characters. This is a great show!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|As I said in the review title, this book was disgusting.  I never finished it.  Can't believe it's a trilogy.  I'm sorry my granddaughter read it.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|great features and very handy. I have used splashtop and others, but this one makes it easier to use some features.
B009R659L8|5.0|however, the kindle print out was not good<br />the print and font changes were awful...paragraphs were messed up...book was good
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Worth the wait.  Rods' voice has matured with him as has his lyrics. There is a good mix of ballards and faster songs.  As a long time fan, I am so proud of this cd.
B0089LOG02|4.0|wanted to read to end to see what happened. Had a good believable story. liked the characters.  would recommend it.
B002NXOQF2|4.0|Enjoyed it 35 years ago and never forgot it.  Now it was not as intriguing as before, but still enjoyed it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I went into this book with a lot of enthusiasm. I wanted to see how one of my favorite series would be wrapped up. I was ready for all sorts of possibilities and wonderful ideas. That's not what I got.<br />Instead, I got an ending so bizarre and pointless I actually screamed at the book. Sookie ends up with the least likely candidate and match of ALL the men in her world. Characters that had been long wrapped up were trotted out to try and build a very thin plot. The whole thing meandered and went nowhere. It was just horrible. It was very clear Harris was completely out of ideas and didn't really have an interest in these characters anymore. That, or she's bored with writing.<br />I've been a vocal Harris fan for years. I've gone to see her speak and I've read every other book she's ever written. This was so disappointing though, I'm thinking of canceling my orders for her upcoming books.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We enjoyed the movie and look forward to the next ones. Everyone can enjoy this movie, no matter what age they are.
B00AAU7AI0|5.0|It is brilliant and a book that will never age. You can read again and again a must have. Wow
B0016BPWNM|4.0|Never take anything for granted and pay attention to what those around you say. Minor things that others say sometimes turn out to be very important. Blu-ray detail isn't kind to the green screen effects in the scene with the Chillydowns which can even be noted on VHS, but the sound is awesome.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|While I really enjoyed the movie on the whole, I was left wondering... Well, I can't remember what I was going to say here, as I've forgotten the end of the movie by now, and that witty comment has now escaped me. I love lamp.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Paid $7 for it, installed updates, made a log in, and i can't log in or change my password. &quot;will rate better when issue is resolved.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|To quote Yoda, &#34;Do or do not. There is no try.&#34; Either you watch this series, or you will end up like Alderaan.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This has always been a favorit album for me.  The digital remaster is exactly like the original but better quality sound.
B00881PTRC|5.0|We have so much fun playing this game. My son and I pick sports and it is so much fun to try and guess the words. The graphic stickman and his nemesis are hysterical. You almost want to lose or get close to losing so that the stickman will have more animation!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Terrific series! Looking forward to the next segments . Truly an English soap opera. Loved the grammar and good manners portrayed.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is fun, your eyes might go buggy for a minute, but try and swipe groups of three before the timer goes!
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|As a faculty member in business and a quasi-administrator, I'm always curious why some people always chip in to help and others don't, and what is the payoff. Grant's book drew my attention after an NY Times article about him. I'm always looking for good things to share with students and co-workers, and this clearly fits the bill.It's both a manageable read and supported with some actual evidence.  I have already recommended it to 10 people. For students, teachers or folks in the workforce, it's worth your while.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|The actors did an awesome job bringing this movie to the big screen. They kept to the book and made the characters believeable.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the game is very addictive.  very easy to play..I can't seem to put it down...unless it's to build my coins back.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is a story that has stood the test of time. It is thought povoking.<br />The music stays in your head! I have collected several DVDs that are musicals. This is one of the best.
B005XZHQKY|5.0|Purchased for my kids and they really like it. The 3D effects are very good. I recommend it to all.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Wow what a long movie. Trying to shove 10 years into 2 years is impossible, I get it.. but still, it's long man!! The events kinda take center stage and make the actors move into the background.. But nice rendition of actual events.
B00BQJTHYY|4.0|Very awesome metal CD! I only gave four stars because I GREATLY underestimated the creepy factor of some dude screaming at me in a foreign language for an hour.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Title says it all. JLaw does an excellent job of being kwaaazzyy! Cooper, De Niro fit snugly into their characters. Not a &#34;feel-good&#34; movie but certainly will put a small smile on your face at the end.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Glad it was free on Amazon Prime.  I would have been terribly upset if I had paid for it.  With such an all-star cast I would have expected it to be better, but I was wrong!
B00886XQO0|5.0|I had turtle beach head phones xp500<br />I thought these looked cool<br />oh yea they are cool<br />they sound great, I cant even hear my wife. thats a plus wasnt on the discreption.<br />now she throws things at the back of my head, Its ok Amazon has tall computer chairs with padded head rest.<br />life is good Awsome head phones
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Game of Thrones is one of the best shows ever made. Gorgeous cinematography. Art design and costumes are so beautiful. The actors are wonderful but most importantly the writing is so good we were instantly hooked.
B00B5SJEOO|5.0|So glad they finally made this soundtrack a digital download!  Been wanting to get the CD for a long time but they were so pricey!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Game of Thrones is one of the best shows ever made. Gorgeous cinematography. Art design and costumes are so beautiful. The actors are wonderful but most importantly the writing is so good we were instantly hooked.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|This movie felt long and never really got very engaging. The story plodded along while nothing much happened, and then it was over. Invest your time elsewhere.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of our favorites. We love the interesting characters and the art direction. A winner for sure! No wonder it's such an obsession for so many.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the best show. Working on Season 3 and cant get enough. The cast is fantastic and I'm completely addicted.
B00B9366VO|4.0|If you're a music buff you will love this movie. The last part lost the storyline and just became a &#34;making of&#34; his latest album and I kinda lost interest but loved the first 2/3 of the film. He obviously had lost of money, help and power to get those interviews and get this film whipped together in such a short amount of time. Good for him!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show! I just can't get enough of it. I love the time period and how everyone interacts. The cast is fantastic.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I have been using ES Explorer as my File Manager of choice for quite some time.  I've tried other File Managers, and always found that they fell short in one way or another.  Up until now, I have enjoyed ES Explorer immensely.<br /><br />Until the most recent update.  In an attempt to add tons of \\"bells and whistles\\", and (apparently) try to make the UI more \\"sexy\\", the developers have ruined what, for me, were the basic strengths of ES Explorer -- simplicity and cleanliness.  One reason I chose it was because of its simple UI, which -- among other things -- allowed me to see ALL of my folders on a single (10.1\\" tablet) screen.  Now, for some reason, they have chosen to space out the folder icons so that 80% of the screen is \\"white space\\" -- and I have to scroll 4 times just to see all of my folders!  Oh, they added the ability to use \\"small icons\\" -- but that just reduces the size of the folder icon, and they are STILL spaced WAY out, making extremely inefficient use of the screen space.  Then, they figured that they hadn't \\"stolen\\" enough screen space, so they added a side menu bar, a bottom left tool bar, a bottom right tool bar, and an upper menu bar -- all of which serves to reduce the \\"folder space even further.  I feel like I'm running a Web browser with half a dozen toolbar plug-ins!<br /><br />Then they decided that the previous interface was too simple, too direct, too intuitive.  So they moved everything around, changed how you access various things, and basically added \\"taps\\" to get to almost everything that I got to directly before.  All of the new \\"features\\" now mean that you have to sift through additional (unwanted) tool bars, menu options, and extra \\"taps\\".<br /><br />Oh, they \\"pretty-fied\\" the screen -- added colors (making folders blue now, instead of the world-wide accepted standard of \\"manila folders\\" used everywhere else -- why do I want a blue folder????)  If that's not enough, the text on the screen is now so small, I can barely read it on a 10.1\\" hi-res screen.  (I would HATE to try to read this on a phone screen.)  I now have to go back through all of my Settings and *try* to see if I can get this back to something I'm familiar with, something I'm comfortable with.  I'm very disappointed with this update.<br /><br />Here's a tip for *all* developers:  when you come out with an \\"update\\" that completely (and radically) changes the entire UI, check during installation to see if a previous version was already installed.  And then provide the ability to change back to the old UI, either with a Setting or a button click, or even do it by default.  Radical UI changes are not \\"friendly\\".  (And yes, I also refuse to use the Windows 8 Metro POS interface, too.)  :)10.1\\" hi-res screen.  (I would HATE to try to read this on a phone screen.)

B004LUS390|5.0|I have been using Autodesk products for several decades, and have never been disappointed.  With a little patience and experimentation, some amazing arteorks can be created.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|google has always been my search place, it always give me the answers I am looking for some times more.
B003VBNN54|4.0|I love this movie. Don't know why, it just tugs at the happy strings. I mean it's all about the go for it attitude we all should have. I mean, she has a good life going on where she is, loving friends and such, so why go? Because she believes in herself. Problem is, she didn't know how hard it would be to get into the music business. Then, she finally makes her own dream come true with help of a friend who became her Beau.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Excellent acting. Very intense drama. Got part way through the last episode and had to wait a couple of days to finish it because I was reluctant to witness the final outcome, even though I knew how it ended!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It's like a good book you just can't put down! You just have to know what happens next... but, instead of turning the page you start the next episode.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|This movie was basically a bunch of men sitting in various rooms talking.  I was not impressed with Lincoln's impersonation either.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This was a hilarious movie.  I didn't know what to expect when I first placed it in my DVD player.  But, let me tell you, I would love to see these two brothers make another one.  I won't give it away because it's worth the watch.
B00498YZH8|5.0|This amazingly real story is seldom revealed to us with such genuine and profound connection; the novel's author, movie director and all the actors have acomplished this and deserve all the critic's and audience's accolades.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Great story full excitement<br />I gave the book a four because of some parts of the story were hard to remember an  pronounce the names of God's and Goddesses but still an awesome story!
B000JIN3J8|4.0|Would be 4+++ stars.  My alltime favorite is the recent movie version starring Keira Knightly--a true 5 star event.  In regard to this version, I think the actress who played Elizabeth was excellent--vivacious, funny, sly, all the things we love about that character.  The Elizabeth in the more recent A&E version just doesn't really bring what we love about her to life.  That said, while the actor playing Darcy in this version was gorgeous--a little more life would have been more interesting.  I know Darcy is stoic, understated, and prideful but give me a bit more emotion (why the final star was withheld).
0375842209|5.0|This book is a must read!  Beautifully written!  A wonderful story and so thought provoking and leaves you thinking of the book long after you put it down.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I waited so long for this to come to Kindle and it was so worth the wait. This game is fun and funny and has so much replay value and is great for on the go since it can be played in short chunks. It's also amazing the things can be created and your might even learn something. A Must buy for only .99 and don't forget to buy the word pass for only .99 since it more then double the length of the game. Buy now.
B0016JBCJW|1.0|Couldn't wait until it was over. I like Owen Wilson and Adrien Brody. I guess they did this film for a friend just to get a trip to India.<br /><br />Save your time and money.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I only bought this book because someone kept raving about it, but I can barely stand to read it. I can only force myself to read a page or two at a time, but I'm a bit picky.
B00B4W4UAY|5.0|Around about the time I purchased this excellent authentic Snake sounding album, I had the misfortune to hear a track from the new Whitesnake Made in Japan live album (check it out yourself on You Tube). I had never heard such a butchering of Fool for your loving as I heard then. I could probably play it that badly myself. Then I listened to this, and that wonderful, warm, true Whitesnake sound was here. Whitesnake at their best were the pinnacle of blues rock with finesse in their music, and with two original members and everyone a talented musician this what you get here. Everything is here right down to Micky Moody's slide guitar greatness.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is another movie to be watched over and over.  It is a fun, uplifting story with a great cast.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I love all books Ireland.  This one was pulling at my heartstrings.  Could picture it in my mind.  Loved it and hated for it to end
6305128952|5.0|Love it! I had seen this movie several years ago, and decided to buy it. It is a good story.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Best movies of all time! Beautiful soundtrack! Whitney Houston's greatest work!! A legend that will never be forgotten. Can watch this movie over and over again.
B000BNI99K|5.0|This was another gift that I bought for my dad and he's really enjoying it. Neither he nor I have any complaints at all.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game.My 4 year old loves as much as me. It is a fun challenge with easy to more challenging games
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Another good mystery. Kept me on edge while reading. It was hard  put it down. Would recommend this for a good read
B00AKS656U|5.0|It is a good child game and wont give your kids nightmares.  It shows kids that you can be whatever you want.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I liked this movie but would not include it in an all time favorite category.  It came together in the end for a fantastic conclusion but the journey itself was unfamiliar territory for me, especially the island encounter.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Exciting... great acting...  nuf said.  Oh... I need 15 (11) more words.  Action scenes pulled off with great visuals.  The End
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Gangster Squad was pretty damn good. It didn't drag and got straight to the point, which I really liked. GS had a great cast and Penn rocked it. Although, I love me some Ryan G. I feel like he didn't fit for some reason. He did well. I'd definitely watch it again!! :D
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|This was a good movie. It would have been great if it didn't have a few slow periods throughout. By, never the less good stuff.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Overall I thought this was a pretty funny film. A couple parts dragged but I can recommend this as a fun comedy to anyone.
0061119725|5.0|This is my 27-month old daughter's favorite book!  She brings it to us daily and we have to read it AT LEAST 5 times in a row.  We've brought it with us on trips and it's always a favorite for her and her friends to get some energy out and keep entertained.  Always a hit!  If you like Eric Carle, you'll love this interactive book!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fun app and it doesn't get boring.  Each turn is different and it doesn't just fill time, it's enjoyable to play.  You WANT to better your time.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|A visual ride unlike any other, just a purely fun ride that any anime fan should partake in. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. While it is a bit over the top, just the pure fun of the whole thing is just something amazing
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The series is great. Its to bad that I have to wait a year or so before the next one comes out. I'll probably have to reread it to keep the people straight.<br />Great Author.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had heard all about Downton Abbey from friends but never dound the time to watch until I had surgery.  Now I am truly addicted.  It is a beautifully written series and simply lovely to watch.  The period costumes are exquisite and the characters are complex and well-developed. It is a classic that must be viewed!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is a great book. I have been reading the trilogy series and have to wait for the last book. So I'm starting from the beginning books and reading them. No disappointments yet.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This book was recommended to me by someone I admire. It came at the right time in my life! Thank you
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Jessica Chastain shows that she is a multi talented actress that I hope has a long career!  The events were an accurate representation of the real events coupled with the real behind the scenes trials and turbulence.  Great movie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best fiction I have read in ages. Hard to believe there are characters who can be SO BAD!! Won't disappoint!
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is one of the most delightful, uplifting movies made in an era when most contain extraneous violence and/or impossible special effects supposedly accomplished by human beings.<br /><br />Hooray for this one!  It's a home run!
B0064W67IM|5.0|I had put off reading this series for a long time, but I finally decided to pick up a copy and it is amazing! Great story, and I couldn't put it down--and most definitely finishing the whole series.
B002ZG976U|3.0|Saw it on TV and decided it's something I'll enjoy watching occasionally.  Story line is weak, though Christina Agulera gets to show off her talent in belting out songs and even has a ballad that shows another side of her ability.  Still like Cher's personality, but even with today's technical aids, age of her voice is showing when she does her ballad.  However, she sounds great when she knocks out the title song.  Dance numbers are real show-stoppers!!
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I'm now a Bradley Cooper fan.  I like Jennifer Lawrence.  She's an intriguing actor, but I think Bradley's performance really makes the movie.
B004N8CP8K|5.0|I wanted a remote desktop app. to connect to the server in my house and this works great (plus, it's free). The negative reviews for this app seem to be from non-technical users or those who would like this use this as an enterprise-level solution (both of which, I am not). Good job on the app!
B009X00E18|3.0|Got this through the Vine program, but realized seconds after ordering it was for the HD and not the normal Fire. So hard to evaluate, as we have a Fire. But seems solidly made and would suit well. Giving a neutral review, as does not seem to be a way to delete from my Vine listing.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great app. Connects to my Windows Shares as promised. Allows for me to copy files from the Windows PC to my Kindle. Does not provide much file management utilities (delete file, etc.) which isn't a consideration for me.. so I give It 5 stars.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|Great show - focus's in on a different time period then Downton Abby. But very similar in its focus. Political issues and how life changed and went on during some huge change in the world.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Great Watch for the money - They are dependable and hold up well. I would recommend for anyone looking for a good, durable watch that wont break the bank
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones have great sound considering there low price. They are lightweight and stay in your ears, unlike many of the other headphones out there.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Many complex and ambiguous characters, especially Maxie. If this is your genre, there's nothing not to like.<br /><br />The writing is tight, unlike the writing of this review which has to have a minimum word count before I can submit it, hence this irrelevant observation.
B0096PAA6E|2.0|Way too much rock influence for my taste.<br /><br />I have Gary many times live and know he has major blues chops. Please give me more of that.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|love it !!!!!!!!!!  I like the different types of birds and specialty items like the popocorn.<br />recommend it for anyone who likes a challenge
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read all three books and could not put them down.  The story line was continuous, the characters were well described, and there was constant action and adventure.  There is a lot of blood and gore so I do not recommend it for children or junior high aged kids.  It's a great read for adults of any age.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is one to be thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family.  We are now calling our big dog Richard Parker (you'll see what i mean)
B00CL68BK2|3.0|Didn't live up to the hype.  Mildly entertaining.  Fair acting but not an exceptional performance.  Relationships a little unrealistic and contrived.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|From the first season I have been a fan. I'm ready and cant wait for the next season. Love, love, love it
B00BHMETKC|2.0|over rated ,  you know the ending before movie starts and there are no surprises throughout the movie, no idea how this thing won the oscar,bunch folks hiding in canadian embassy for 2 hours
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|this processor into a beast wow I can not believe the ease that makes every game in 1080 all games and the processor does not pass the 50% is a very happy beast recommend intel is best
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Unecessarily long and violent. Yes, that's just his way, but it doesn't make it right. The story had potential but the length and gore took away from the story.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|I like Titin always. The quality and Sound perfect. It is a good film to enjoy with all family members.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great movie it had a lot of action and suspense will be purchasing for my collection. All the actors where great noone disappointed you
B001A4LYN2|5.0|I viewed this because I became a Daniel Day Lewis fan. I had thought it might be violent, but it was not, except at one point. This movie is about oil rigs, and that is a dangerous industry, so gore connected to this movie is secondary to danger of the oil industrial dangers.  Daniel Day Lewis does amazing acting, playing an arch baddie. The movie is almost a classic character study of a bad individual who stumbles into wealth related to oil rigging.  He is so astonished he does so well that, he develops more skills and is financially successful and becomes wealthy. He remains underneath a bad man.  You see possible glimpses for why he is as he is... such as he might have had very very bad childhood.  You see him do oil business and you wonder... will he ever lose self control and do some danger?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was difficult to put down once I began.  A really good read; each chapter is a different viewpoint.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Easy to read and informative about the meaning of the different flowers. I would recommend this book for summer reading.
B004S2W7F2|4.0|I really liked the first part where it gave the outline of the concept of the holographic universe and found it really made sense for me, both in David Bohm idea of the holographic universe and the idea of Pribram's holographic brain. The second part was about all the cases of esp, life after death, etc etc, which is well explained by a holographic perspective. It was more familiar and less interesting than the challenging ideas of the first part.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Loving this new song by Daft Punk! It's a little different than their usual sound but still has that Daft Punk feel! love it!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My kids really like this fun game and it becomes fast paced very quickly. Amazing graphics! The game teaches you as you as well. Win win.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|great classic over the top Tarintino. great soundtrack great acting great movie. Leo is amazing in his role, and really cuts his hand in one scene...check it out!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down!! I cant wait to read it again! the twists and turns were shocking!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Loved the series - sorry to see it end!  It seemed like Merlin could have told Arthur about himself a little earlier-
B000FA675C|5.0|A plot that twists and turns never giving the reader to o much.<br />Symbolic mystery abounds and separating fact from accepted<br />Religious belief makes for a most rewarding read
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Such a great album ! Bought it about 2 weeks after they had come to town and played a concert. I was so bummed that I missed what would have been an awesome show.
0802473156|5.0|Great book and very good advice for all.  Highly recommend it to those in need.  Bought it to help relationship with my wife
B0094K1K8I|2.0|I wanted to enjoy a horror movie but this did not &#34;do it&#34; for me. Guess I'll stick to Monster flicks.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I never thought I would like this book. The title is so very dull, but in my opinion it ranks up there with Wurthering Heights, A romantic mystery. I could read it again and again.
B008XFJEE2|4.0|Really nice to see Mickey without the plastic surgery misstake.  Lots going on here.  I enjoyed watching late at night and my husband enjoyed the &#34;bonus&#34;.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Okay, I was warned not only by the bad reviews, but by the content of the last few books in this series as well. I can only compare it to a bad train wreck, where you know you should'nt look , but you do it anyway. Yes, it was BAD, but this series has been dieing a slow death since True Blood started. Guess that's what happens when you sell out and see all the characters you created get perverted to make $$. Heed the warnings and don't waste your time or money!
B001IF277K|5.0|new battery works great just like the one that came with the phone bought a sony external charger to charge it while using other battery !
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie touched my heart. I sang, laughed, cried ... what more can you ask for from a great movie! This version is awesome.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|There are not a lot of platformers I like on the kindle fire but this is a good one. I recommend it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Excellent price, and two digital downloads included!  The movie was actually very<br />good.  Ordered for my daughter,  decided to watch it, and was hooked.  Any music<br />lover will enjoy this movie.  Can't figure out why Samantha Barks  was not given more<br />mention, better than Anne H., and a better part.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|good musicianship with good songwriting that combines classic rock influence with blues tinged rock. I recommend it to those who like real music without the electronic assistance.
034580404X|5.0|I bought but I did not have time to read yet. But I am so excite to start. I think it is a great book, can not wait! ;). I definitely recommend to a friend.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|I do many presentations every week.  the format of this book was well organized, and easy to read.  Many useful tips that can be applied immediatly to any presenter of all leverls.
0670034711|5.0|Well I did not have time to read yet, but I love it the product and I am so excited to start read :)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey has always been a favorite of mine, but she's even more so now.  I love that the stories were not only funny but also gave insight into the person behind the genius.  I usuallly look for this line in a review when picking out a funny book - &#34;laughed out loud.&#34;  Well, I did!  Loved this book!
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|not bad certainly thought provoking. not really fun but whatever. I play when I'm bored for something to do but I otherwise never posy it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I chose this rating because it was educating for me. I also reccomend this book because it tells people what they need to know.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|It's no Angels & Demons, but it still had me turning pages. So no, it's not perfect, but I have to admit I still enjoyed it. Some of the flaws could have been avoided without much effort. These things bugged me:<br /><br />* The CIA character is named Inoue Sato--two last names. Why? It would be like having an American character in Japanese novel named Smith Johnson. And even that would be more likely. I don't expect Dan Brown to speak Japanese, but come on, there's google. Or give your American (of Japanese ancestry) an American first name.<br /><br />* I didn't know what to make of the museum-guide references put in every few pages. It was like a Frohmer's Guide to DC along with the story. On the other hand, the info was interesting. Wasn't necessary to the story and didn't always fit very well, but I still liked reading it. So I'm torn. But it did pull me out of the story to notice it each time.<br /><br />* I'm not wild about bad guys whose main motivation is \\"I'm crazy.\\" I see where it's handy, though.<br /><br />* The ending. Really? That's your end? That's the secret that's been buried for centuries? Why would that be kept a secret from anyone? I won't say what it is, for people who haven't read it and are going to, but it was an anticlimax, to say the least. If you pretend that the whole McGuffin thing at the end was anything else, though, then the rest of the book still holds up OK.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is full of ideas on how to study and learn more about the Bible.  So many added options to study topics and a variety of devotions.  Exceptionally well done!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Rarely use it I use my Smart phone when I need to use my an alarm.<br />it is easier for me
B0064MGU98|2.0|At first I was interested in the whole liberated housewife appeal the show has but half way into the second episode it's quite apparent how cheesy, predictable and especially unrealistic the show is.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I always wanted to see the movie. I say it last year and loved it.<br />Would be tempted to see it again.<br />It was the only movie I saw  in 2012.<br />I am tired of all of this. I have things to do and this is<br />taking too much time.<br />If this is not enough for you.<br />I am sorry
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I love this movie and really wanted to have it in my collection for the future! Couldn't beat the price either!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|BEST book ever. A love story with action<br />Lots of action and horror but very addictive. I would read again
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I purchased this because I enjoyed the tv show and it references this book line.  I think it was very good, but I did enjoy the tv show more.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Couldn't find this CD anywhere locally.  I couldn't wait to hear that great voice. I could never rate Scotty anything less than 5 stars
1568363931|5.0|This book is pretty great. I pair it with the recipes on Maki's website and my husband's lunch is always delicious and somewhat healthy. Very good recipes that are easy to execute. Highly recommended.
B0041D843M|4.0|A convincing book about the benefits of a plant based diet. Recommends dropping animal products entirely rather than a partial approach. Has studies to show this helps with heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Recommend reading.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is very addictive and challenging. Yes, I recommend this to a friend that has a mobile device handy.
B00358ESI4|2.0|way too much gore and really no plot - kept waiting for a real plot and authentic presentation of how military works...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addictive and challenging. Yes, I recommend this to a friend that has a mobile device handy.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|There's no way I should be playing this game. I'm a busy professional and I just don't have time to keep going through 80 levels-- but I can't get myself to stop --it's just so engrossing! The puzzles get harder and harder to match my increasing skills and repertoire. The graphics and story line are secondary, but really well done. One of the best features of the puzzles is that (so far-- with about 3/4 of the levels completed) --there is a way to solve each separate problem -- but it's not just the same technique over and over-- you really have to think through the challenge and come up with a solution that fits -- and the solutions can be very different -- it is essential to find the \\"weak point\\" to exploit. I'm really impressed with the thought and design that went into creating this game -- and I've really been enjoying working it. I seldom stay with anything this long - usually I get bored or reach a point where I can't move forward -- and neither has happened yet in Around the World in 80 Days.  I highly recommend you give this game a try -- or perhaps you shouldn't-- you might get addicted!
B001EBYM8A|4.0|AS A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL FUGITIVE SERIES I WAS CAUTIOUS IN MY EXPECTATIONS. I'M HAPPY TO SAY I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED.
193700788X|5.0|I got my copy today, and could not put it down, read it in one sitting.  I think it tied up a lot of loose ends, and ended about the only way it could.  It was worth waiting for.  I could have read a few hundred pages more!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Watched HBO series.  Of course book is much better!  Waiting on the sixth book.  Reading 5 th book slowly! Great!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|With Evernote, no matter where I am, or what device I use, I can quickly jot down notes, ideas, or important info and not worry about where I saved it.  With add-ons like Skitch, I can take pictures of things that inspire my art and make notations right in the image, then Evernote once again makes sure all my devices have a copy. Brilliant!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game Is AWSOME. I can't stop playing it. It is an irresistible mix of fighting and dodging. It's similar to running games but much better
B00B4804KS|5.0|I don't have a 3D TV or projector, but if I ever get one, at least I'll already have a lot of 3D Blu Rays.

B00AYCOUOG|4.0|first half (side?) is excellent. Energetic, sharp, engaging. It appears to pick up from where headmusic left (omitting the unfortunate new morning). The second half is slower, more contemplative. It lacks however the magic of some of Suede's classic ballads (such as dark star, she, etc.). It is on par with most of Brett's solo work, which makes a good listen while it lasts, but nothing that sticks for long.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book has it all.  Where one could say the middle book seems confused and the third book leaves the reader unsatisfied, this book has all the yummy bits: action, romance, uncertainty and creativity.

B005LAIIKI|3.0|There's no doubt that Tarantino peaked early with non-linear deep pulp \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and one of the best movies in history \\"Pulp Fiction\\". So it's going to be an uphill battle for any follow-up, even nearly 20 years later.<br /><br />Django Unchained (the \\"d\\" is silent\\") tries hard to live up, and it's a good movie, but it's not as good as you hope. The problem is the linear nature of the film, Tarantino doesn't write three-act screenplays, he writs six-act ones.<br /><br />The first part of Django covers the violent yet whimsical freeing of Django from a set of slave traders by Dr. Shultz (Christoph Waltz) on of Tarantino's finest characters and a purveyor of  brilliant and hysterical linguistics. He needs Django to ID a bounty for him so he offer's him freedom and a cut of the profit in return. Django quickly accepts and they two are off.<br /><br />This could easily be the film, or at least Part-1 of a Kill Bill style epic. There's plenty to mine here as the \\"n____r on a horse\\" learns the game of kill and cash-out while being a black man in a time of slavery in the south riding a horse with a gun strapped to his hip. But that's not the story Tarantino is trying to tell. Too quickly he zooms past - so fast he uses a note at the bottom of the screen to tell us \\"this and that happened, but this is a revenge story gone awry in the telling so we need to zoom past all the fun stuff that happened over the winter.\\" It's an unworthy device.<br /><br />The second film find's Django and Shultz arriving at \\"Candyland\\" (yeah, it's funny) where they pose as slavers looking to buy a well-bred slave fighter for brutal, to-the-death entertainment. What they really want is to have Django's wife, a German speaking slave as an add-on to the deal. When the double-cross is exposed (they never planed on buying the fighter or more important, paying) the screen is filled with blood. Again, this in and of itself is a complete film's worth of plot. Django tends his wounds, plans his (awesome) revenge and rides to free his wife.<br /><br />The end result is not so much epic as hurried. Tarantino should take his own playbook out and re-edit this to put the first splashy blood-soaked sequence first, once we establish which major characters die we can then proceed to tell the story forward to show the audience how we got there and omit the \\"several months passed\\" BS in the middle.<br /><br />Is Django entertaining, Tarantino quality film? Yes. Is it as good as it should be, no.esome) revenge and rides to free his wife.<br /><br />The end result is not so much epic as hurried.

193700788X|1.0|This book read like a bad rough draft. As many many others have said this book is full of plot holes and continuity errors. Ms. Harris also betrayed her characters by writing them completely out of character. I will never again purchase anything written by Ms. Harris.

193700788X|1.0|I could not believe she chose to end the series that way.  It was all jammed together at the very end with no rhyme or reason.  She gave no great ending to previous relationships and then made one out of no where.  Just terrible.  I cannot believe I bought this piece of junk and ruined the series for myself.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|can't get enough of Castle.....very shortly season is coming to a close....it will seem forever before it comes back..<br />when I'm  not watching Castle, I'm watching more Castle.  I love the storylines and the characters....they just seem to fit the story.<br />No one has left, died, or came back to life, so the story goes on just like life.  I know I'm probably not making a lot of sense, but Castle is my most favorite show.  I thought the 100 episode was really great until &#34;Still&#34;.....I've watched it a dozen or more times.<br />It was fun watching all the flashbacks and Kate finally saying the words to Rick

B00AN0KGWE|5.0|What can I say about Game of Thrones that hasn't already been said?  It's Lord of the Rings for grown-ups.  George R.R. Martin (and the HBO writers) pay viewers the courtesy of not dumbing down the complexity or the realism of a remarkable, engaging story.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This movie was awesome!<br />I read about this girl along time ago in a breakaway magazine subscription I use to read when I heard they made a move out of it.<br />I had to watch it and I loved it!<br />Awesome movie!

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Movie is a snapshot of the pre Civil War era.  be forewarned that it is very violent but still very enjoyable.  Also use of the N word is commonplace as used as often in the South as Y'all.  Surprise ending is worth the wait.  Also the director Quentin Tarantino pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock by playing a cameo role in the picture.  Just like Sir Alfred Hitchcock.  See if you can find him.  If not, check the closing credits.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a story with many layers, easy to read.  Keeps your attention from the beginning to the end.  Highly recommended.
B001QUL73W|5.0|This very well recorded and dynamically wide-ranging disc from 2008 was Petrenko's Shostakovich calling card. It declared a number of things. Firstly it clearly declared that Liverpool had a new young conductor who had plenty to say about Shostakovich. Secondly it declared that an inspired Liverpool orchestra had the potential to take on the big name players. Thirdly it declared that Naxos were determined to give a no-holds-barred dynamic level to this series that would do Shostakovich justice and perhaps require understanding or absent neighbours to those who wished to play the disc at anything like a realistic volume level.<br /><br />All of these things were exciting declarations and printed critical opinion from musical journals and newspapers were quick to lavish praise on the venture.<br /><br />Several years later the series has developed and is now a major reference point for those interested in this composer. Petrenko is no shrinking violet and he has succeeded in creating a Russian drive and sound from his Liverpudlian orchestra that has remained constant throughout the series. Generally this is achieved by tempi that keep on the move, but not always. This symphony certainly has long passages of desolation that demand, and get, desolate playing where time seems to stand still. The symphony is very pictorial in its political message and Petrenko makes sure that the imaging is put over dramatically and strongly.<br /><br />This performance is far more impactive than either Rostropovich or Haitink for example who fail to dig deep enough into the Russian psyche. Some of the best Russian recordings are unfortunately not of the highest 'fi' and that matters in such a large scale work as this. Years ago Stokowski recorded a very fine performance on Capitol which delivered musically, emotionally and also sonically. In reality though, it is unlikely, however, that it would now seem superior to this far newer disc.<br /><br />In conclusion therefore, I would suggest that this disc now deserves to be the starting point for anyone interested in adding this symphony to their collection.be the starting point for anyone interested in adding this symphony to their collection.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read with just enough detail to make it interesting without putting me to sleep. I would definitely recommend it.
193700788X|1.0|If I could, I would give this \\"book\\" -10 stars. I was an avid fan of the Sookie series for years. Like everyone else reviewing this book, I waited with baited breath for each new installment. The writing wasn't phenomenal, but the storyline and characters were fantastic. Then the HBO series started... Initially (until the disastrous 5th season), I really enjoyed that as well, but the book series really started going downhill after the television series was released. It seemed like Harris just got lazy and tired of the story and the characters she had created. She spent almost an entire series growing and watering a relationship between Eric and Sookie, only to give it a cheap, quick death and to give our once beloved heroine a blase and completely predictable ending (I saw it coming two or three books ago). Not only was I annoyed that every single character lost their identity and seemed to merge into one single, ridiculously ignorant and irritating entity, but I was simply bored to tears by the end of Dead Ever After. Indeed, the title was true to form, as my love for this series is completely Dead Ever After. Harris is a weak writer at best and I honestly don't think I will ever forgive her for selling out the way she did. She cheated her once avid fans out of a decent wrap up to a once good series (which hasn't deserved the word good since book 10, to be honest). I think an illiterate third grader could have done a better job.<br /><br />Harris: like so many other one-time fans, you have lost my respect and admiration. I will never purchase another book with your name on it. You're a sell-out. You should have respected your fans enough to end the series three books ago instead of lining your own pockets by writing books about characters that you tired of long ago. Enjoy those ridiculously large diamond earrings your're wearing in that chintzy photo on the back of your book. You certainly won't be receiving my patronage ever again.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Not a bad read , but something about it rubbed me the wrong way, I know the author went a long way to say it wasn't all about him , but it sure seemed that way.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Great movie.  I was surprised how fast the movie arrived at my house.  If you like MMA you would like this movie
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A worthy addition to the Ryan family saga.  I would recommend it for fans of Tom Clancy and the action intrigue genre as a whole.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|The CDs were all in good shape and none had problems playing. I would recommend purchasing from someone with solid reviews. It's also one of the best seasons of how I met your mother
B000054OTY|2.0|I bought this hoping for a good wide screen transfer.  What I got was a non-enhanced disk containing most of it.  Missing is the studio logo and first few seconds of the title.  It's as if I walked into the theater a minute or two late.  Maybe I'm picky, but it seems like they could have done a much better job.
B0053O89IS|4.0|I love the &#34;BONES' Television series, but the seventh season did not contain enough episodes for the price. There are two episodes on this collection featuring  a &#34;serial nut&#34; that were very well done.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I liked this book and kept wondering how things would connect in the end.  And to my pleasure, it did connect conveniently and nicely.  There was an awful lot of death in this book, which perhaps could have been minimized, but the plot was interesting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this is an outstanding last book in a trilogy.  nothing else can be added to make this story any better. its more philosophical than  the previous books, but that is what ties them<br /> all together.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third and final book is slow at start but once it picks up the pace near the end, one cannot stop reading it. I enjoyed reading the Hunger Games trilogy very much.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Awesome. And I don't even like music documentaries. I love the path this doc takes. Very surprising and very rewarding.
0802473156|5.0|This is a good book that will help you improve your relationships with your family, friends and co-workers by helping you understand what is their primary love language.  It should be required reading for all high school seniors, and it is a MUST read if you are engaged to be married as the minor time investment now can potentially save you much headache and strife down the road.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I purchased this product primarily for boosting the volume on my desktop computer to my headphones, I found that on certain sites the volume was far too low, I also wanted to listen to my IPod on my set of AKG 240 headphones I just purchased and I couldn't quite get the volume I was used to with the ear buds.  So far so good, the sound is good, clarity is good and the volume is plenty for my needs.  The bass seems to be a little more prevalent but the highs haven’t been sacrificed and I have to say I'm pretty satisfied so far.<br /><br />The size is about 1 1/2&#34; X 1 1/2&#34; X 1/4&#34; so it is very small and portable and weighs literally nothing.<br /><br />I had to charge my unit when it first arrived, so make sure you do that otherwise you’ll be scratching your head like I did and wondering why the darn thing wasn’t working.  The unit does come with a USB charger as well as two male to male connectors and two handy little belt clips.  I'm not sure how long the charge will last at this time so portable users may want to read other reviews to get that info but for my purposes charge time is not really that important.<br /><br />Pros:  Extremely portable, extremely light, great price (for what it is) and more than satisfactory amplification for larger headphones.<br /><br />Cons: It is made out of plasticand does not look or feel like it will stand up to a lot of abuse.
0802473164|5.0|This is a good book and illustrates how the love languages are applied specifically to men.  Much of the content is very similar to the regular 5 Love Languages book, but it's nice to have a man-specific book considering how men are portrayed so poorly as bumbling fools by the media and the entertainment industry.  This book can help you improve your relationships and interactions with others by understanding their primary love languages.

0765325950|5.0|I have been a Wheel of Time reader for 15 years, starting in high school when a friend gave me the first 4 books. I reread the series each time a new book came out. I was very sad that Robert Jordan passed away and was very excited that someone else was going to finish the series since I really wanted to follow the characters. I am very glad they chose Brandon Sanderson. I somehow had never read any of his work prior to his contribution to WoT, but it made me want to read them. I read Mistborn and very much enjoyed it and look forward to reading more. His writing style fits very well into the series and I think he was the perfect man for the job. This is my favorite fantasy series, bar none. I slightly delayed reading this one since it is the last book and I didn't want the series to end. It lived up to my expectations. A Memory of Light is full of action and it really wraps up the series as a whole. There are a few strings left dangling, but all the big plot lines are ended by the last page.<br /><br />Do not read this book if you have not read the series. It's like watching the last 10 minutes of a 3 hour movie. Don't do it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series and you don't mind lugging this giant book around and having to stop reading for mundane things like eating and sleeping, then what are you waiting for? Read the book! :)

B00BLGXL3U|5.0|It's hard to explain why this is the best, except that it's flawless.<br /><br />For those of you who are seeking plot-oriented films in which the answers are given to you....go away or toughen up and watch this with your eyes and mind open.<br />Such innate themes of mastery and the human mind--this film could be a philosophical rabbit hole, but that is left up to you.<br /><br />Absolutely BRILLIANT camera work, some beautiful scenes in here, as well as unique contrasts throughout the film of light and dark and just awesome lighting and values ahhhhhh.<br /><br />Joaquin Pheonix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams....all do such a perfect job. Amazing job really, a level of acting that not any people can get to.<br /><br />JUST WATCH IT.<br />You could even watch it on mute and be just as blown away.

193700788X|5.0|It was the ending I expected and I enjoyed the book and feel happy with the conclusion the author provided.  I always liked Bill and distrusted Eric.  Sam is the most logical choice and Sookie had made it clear in the earlier books that she was attracted to Sam but didn't want to risk her job or friendship.  Eric fans or even True Blood fans late to the series may find it disappointing (and apparently do).  It wasn't the most dramatically plotted novel but I expected this as it was more to tie up loose ends.  By reading a few of the other reviews I gather that I am in the minority, as there are some rabidly angry fans out there.  The most disappointing part of the book for me is that's the last of the series.  I came to the series long before the tv show had started and have been in love ever since (although a little less enamored during the Quinn years).  I really enjoyed all thirteen books and devoured them unlike anything else.  Thank you Charlaine Harris!

B009LMTDL0|5.0|For any woman who wants to go into 5th gear for her career, Sheryl has paved an amazing road to drive on. Her honesty about balancing family with her job is proof that there isn't really a balance, it's simply a desire that is checked daily.<br /><br />Every story she recounts, even the funny ones, are the perfect building blocks we can use to create change for women in business leadership. She doesn't lie and say &#34;we can have it all.&#34; Sacrifices must be made, lines must be drawn, and we all have a long way to go. This isn't an &#34;anti-male&#34; book, it's a &#34;women can do it, too&#34; script. She doesn't bash men for wanting to lead, or say that women have sat on their hands, it's really a look into where the female gender currently is in the big office. And if we want it to change, it starts with women leaning in more.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I am not familiar with the original books, but enjoyed it all the same. Good movie, good investment of your recreational time.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Iron Man is always a pleasure to watch and great eye candy for women.  Another good movie for if you want to just get out of your head for a while.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I started watching current shows and really enjoyed them.  So I went back to the beginning and watched them like a marathon.  Really enjoyed this show and all of the characters and story lines!  Looking forward to the next season!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The movie is good for if you want to get out of your head for a while.  Lots of action and stays pretty close the the original storyline.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|A great movie for getting pumped up, fast paced and looking great with that old school hand drawn style. The music is thumping and on bluray it looks and sounds great.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I think this a great modern take on the classic children's stories that we all love.  I would definitely recommend.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|my son just loves this! He is 2 months old and greatly prefers it to a regular soothie. It's also super cute!
B000YMMN04|4.0|This is a great movie and I would recommend.  Has a lot of good points that are brought up that people can relate too (i.e. racism, community, etc.).
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|Great series.  I forgot how much I enjoyed in when it was on TV.  They show rushed the plot a bit so it could not have lasted much longer.  The last episode is a bit strange to me, but it still fits.
B00BHMF578|5.0|The movie is based on true events and if you like history than this movie is for you.  It is suspenseful and very enjoyable.
B000003FD9|5.0|flawless - totally deserving of the high praise it has received - clean and pure with none of the flash and dash attempted by so many others
B0077ZNCE2|3.0|It is ok.  It is needed in order to lead up to the last movie. Very slow and not much action.  More like a filler until you get to the end.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|What a great series! The characters are real and relatable. The writing is superb. After every episode, I'm eager for the next. I'm in season two now, and it's just as good.
B003NX76BM|2.0|This was not what I was use to from Nora Roberts. The guy was real callous and cursed worst than me. It was a bad book.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app is so handy and convient! I like being able to view my mail when using my new Kendall Fire.
B00AATV046|5.0|Wife fell in love with this movie when we saw it on TCM. She is a big Cary Grant fan. It is an awesome Christmas story. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of Christmas' stories.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like being able to use this app to read and study the bible. It is a handy way to carry the bible and have it at my finger tips.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|It's an ok movie. It's not a great movie. Wife likes the 80's style music. I would recommend to anyone who like alot of music in their movies.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|The industry standard for studio tracking for decades. A mild but pleasant bump in the high mids leave no doubt about what the drummer and bassist are up to; the hi hats and dead notes will come through. These have a sweet, round middle, yet plenty of punch for the kick to be felt. Stereo imaging is realistic and accurate on playbacks and captures.<br /><br />My only issue with these is that, compared to my old Sony MDR V600s, the ear cushions are a little skimpy. On me (and certain others) there is a bit of compression on the outer ear which tends toward minor discomfort and, worse, attenuation of the upper highs resulting in a little muffling across the spectrum. I find that careful placement and seating of the cans is crucial to avoiding this aggravation. And I must fiddle with this before every take. Sometimes I even have to shim them a bit if I've had a recent haircut.<br /><br />All in all, I've come to prefer high-end in-ears for most applications. But for general tracking and playback, this is the model to buy. For the price, they are, hands down, the best of the breed for studio work and general listening.
B00499QUK2|4.0|I saw this series on PBS when it first aired a couple of years ago.  It is fast paced and features  witty and bright dialogue.<br />The concept of a modern day Sherlock Holmes referencing the Conan Doyle stories in a contemporary manner is incredibly well done.  The acting is superb.  You have to stay focused as dialogue and events move fairly quickly.  This is great entertainment for the viewer who enjoys participating by  using his/her brain cells rather than being hit over the head with the plot or action.
B0013DAC6K|5.0|Every song that this man makes is phenomenal. I've never been unhappy with any of the albums he's put out.  Great album.
B0018RE7DU|5.0|Wanted to see this movie after seeing Richard Gere on the Graham Norton Show (BBC America).  It was worth it just to see Richard's young naked butt.  Great to get it downloaded from Amazon as no rental stores in my area had it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is the second time we watched this movie. It was just as interesting and informative the second time around!
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This book will be a basic for a new way to analyze global economy.  It can explain why developing countries have margin to grow and why developed. countries are fatigued.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|Kurt Russell plays this well.  If you go back now and watch it then it all looks a bit corney and it's better for a drinking game or a flashback movie night. I suggest everyone watch it at least once this movie was great for it's time.  They made 2 more<br />Escape from New Jersey<br />Escape from L.A.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Having seen this AFTER Hot Fuzz, I must say, I was impressed. Wright's flawless ability to blend absurd comedy and drama is always refreshing. Definitely a must buy!
0425252868|5.0|I bought this book for my father based on the recomendation from one of our friends, and he read in a matter of days and really liked this book.
158270208X|5.0|What's funny about the Secret is how much more of a spiritual person it's made me. Using this book every day keeps you highly aware of how you communicate with the universe. I don't necessarily think of it as a \\"wish list\\" book, but I do constantly state what I'm grateful for. The act of writing down your blessings, which you should never be short on, can be extremely liberating, thus putting you on or towards proper alignment with the universe.<br /><br />Using this book seems to be the next step after seeing the powerful film. Definitely a must for those seeking to practice the Secret every day.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easily integrates so you can read your books on the go.  Love  the  ease  off  use  with  my Samsung  Galaxy III.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love, love, love Downton Abbey!! Highly recommend the entire series!  The video quality on Amazon is really good.  If you haven't seen Downton Abbey.....you really need to check it out!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|It is informative, fun, entertaining. Some times overwhelming because the amount of information, but is ok for pass time on weekends.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|No, it's not a story about a team of 8 super-heroes... It's a story about a time mostly forgotten, when we still used film in our cameras. Super 8 was a description of a type of home movie camera, that used Super 8mm film, and the main characters were hooked on making their own movies, with actual plots and props. The story will be best appreciated by the younger generation, but it's still a good sci-fi story, even for adults, and there's plenty of action.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows ever!Can't wait for next season.Always keeps me surprised and on the edge of my seat.
1476715904|2.0|I received the sequel to this book, Point of Retreat, so I knew I had to read this one first. It's been getting a lot of buzz in the blogosphere so I already had it on my TBR list.<br /><br />Slammed by Colleen Hoover stars Layken, a teenaged girl who just lost her father and then was forced to relocate with the rest of her family to Michigan. She meets a handsome boy next door who she realizes later is her teacher. They both battle their feelings for each other as they know their relationship can't happen.<br /><br />We've all seen this movie. Girl falls in love with unattainable boy for some reason-- here he's a teacher. There's some poetry involved, which is rather unfortunate because even though it is the most original part of the book, it loses a lot of its possible effect in text form. We have to imagine the cadence of the words that are italicized for emphasis.<br /><br />I don't really understand why there's so much manufactured drama in this book. Sure, he's her teacher, but she's a senior, and is going to graduate soon. Why can't they wait a year? But there's a lot of crying and carrying on. There are also some plot twists that made me groan out loud-- a trope that has been overdone.<br /><br />The best part of this book was Layken's best friend, Eddie, who was original. I think I would have liked a book in her perspective.<br /><br />I have to say I was pretty disappointed in this book-- I hope that there is a bit more originality in the follow up.
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a very good film considering the time and filming constraints in a movie. They portray the scenes in Mitchell's book fairly well, though not in the detail one who enjoyed the book would like. The film does take some thought to follow since the movie is a compilation of several different story lines, and some will find the concept controversial.<br />The bottom line is if you like to be spoon fed a linear story or enjoy certain American \\"reality\\" television shows this probably isn't the film for you. If you don't fit into either of those categories then I would also read the book to enjoy the movie more.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Love the CD with Enya's amazing voice and command of the Celtic music.  Enjoyed it greatly and recommend it for all music lovers.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett brings us back into a time of great changes into society on both sides of the ocean.  It helps to understand better where our present way of life comes from.
B0037472NY|2.0|I read The Concrete Blonde by Michael Connelly on my kindle fire recently. Somehow, I did not like this book.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|A very interesting alternate look at the Vor society.  The action is funny and always character driven.  Captain Vorpartil's story of maturation is worth reading.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|MI is getting better day by day....Looks like MIGP introduced better & more technology than Skyfall. Its worth watching a movie.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|awesome movie - simply loved the references to the old school games that i used to play.  very good movie overall, excellent graphics
0316066524|5.0|far and away the best book i have ever read. nothing even comes remotely close. this book is phenomenal and wallace is a genius<br /><br />not for the faint of heart - lots of racy stuff, including lots of drug use and discussion of drugs, violence.<br /><br />also lots of big words - don't even try to look them all up our you'll never make it through!<br /><br />gripping narrative and brilliant writing, cannot recommend this novel enough
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I took a break from reading for a few months and this was a great book to feed my thirst for an enchanting story.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I really enjoyed the second book. It kept me intrigued. I wish it had more about how Simon got transformed, but overall I really enjoyed it :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Our weather changes hourly, and I have peace of mind knowing I can check the WX so easily, at home, or on the road.  Plus, I have the option to check WX anywhere with ease of operation.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show captured my attention and interest more than any series ever! It is the type of series you hunker down and watch 6 episodes in a row.
B003102JDM|1.0|Hate to say it but not for me and I doubt it's for you either! If you have to see it rent it ,I made the mistake of buying it!
B009R659L8|5.0|The story catches you with the first page.  Then you cannot leave the book alone.  Mystery continues through the book and you won't be expecting the end.  You'll love the book!
B00003CX6P|5.0|Pulls off a wonderful character in this film as he does in most all I've seen! Worth the money Or rent!
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|There were some parts of the movie that were really funny (like Knocked Up funny), but a majority of it moved slow and was generally dramatic and depressing.  My husband and I were expecting it to be more like Knocked Up, but had trouble even watching the entire thing.  And it's 2+ hours, I won't be watching this one again.
B00008RH3L|2.0|All were OK but some were much better, What one person likes another may not! So you may rent them instead!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Well written, interesting twist on a terrible time in America. You get attached to the characters and hope for a better life for them.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|Not what I thought it would be! could have been better .It's like theiy spit it out befofe anyone else had a chance to.
B00BYH6MZK|5.0|Russell Crowe is true to form and plays a ruthless NYC Mayor who rose all on his own ambition from the streets of Queens. Markie Mark is a has been police office. Honestly the premise of the movie is doubtful but I was a bit surprised at the end. The Photo shots of the City were all from very non traditional angles and the City many bridges are highlighted at night, that is the best feature of Broken City.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|He is a fine actor anyway .If you don't like Clooney your not a film buff . This movie is fantastic,One of his best But I can't say he's done a bad film. Buy it. Well done you will not be dissapointed what so ever!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is so cool I love it I get some cones but I wish I got some more they are so cool
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Loved the action, intrigue and edge of seat mystery.  Cruise delivers an understated and to the point performance. Very surprised at Werner Herzog \\"cameo\\" appearance - chilling!  Great movie.
0670014893|1.0|There are so many things to like in the work of John le Carre. As a stylist, he can hold his own with almost anyone. As a plotter, a storyteller, he is masterful. He is positively brilliant at creating characters that are generally believable, human, and likable. He is, unequivocally, a great writer. And \\"A Delicate Truth\\" is, unequivocally, a very bad book, primarily in that he has turned character into caricature and nuance into polemic. Of the many truly bad guys in this book, not one has any real hope of engendering a sympathetic response from the reader (it should be obvious I don't mean sympathetic in that you love him or excuse him; I mean sympathetic in that you understand him). While le Carre's early books left little doubt about the author's stance on the moral exigencies of spying, they did offer an appropriately ambiguous moral universe that enabled the reader to see both sides of that particular dialogue. But there is no ambiguity here, and the book descends into the realm of satire and farce (an American defense contractor called \\"Ethical Outcomes\\" -- as the snarks of the world would say, \\"puh-leeze!\\" or \\"Really?\\"). All of his American characters are grotesques in this novel, which would bring smiles to the faces of those who share his views but have zero place in a serious novel. (Perhaps he should try to write a satire or at least a comedy.) I say this with regret because I am a big fan of le Carre's work and have read every novel of his but his rage, his incendiary rage, at America, at British imperialism, and at amoral capitalism, has transcended his ability to write novels. He has become a polemicist and that is the death of the novelistic endeavor.
0345803507|5.0|Great book! Sad to see the trilogy end. Hope she writes more! I will be reading anything this author writes.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have one of the original Bose Soundocks, which I've used with an older iPod for years. Recently, I wanted to listen to streamed Internet radio using my iPhone4. The streaming and sound are fine, but the old Bose does not charge the iPhone. I called Bose, who offered me the option to get the Soundock rewired for $99, or trade up for $199. Doing either would allow charging of the iPhone, but not the iPod. Ugh. The dockStubz+ turned out to be the perfect solution. For $23, I can easily stream with my iPhone AND charge it anytime I want, while maintaining full functionality of my old-and loaded-iPod.<br />Editorial note: I love that such a simple solution was available, and enabled me to continue using older, but still functioning tech gear. Not surprisingly, neither Bose nor Apple pointed me in this direction. Nice to escape the stranglehold of premature obsolescence!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I thought the humor was great and the characters were fun.  It is a unique monster movie with a fun plot.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Twists and turns of reality and really, I laugh out Loud!<br />A wonderful mirror to the way we act on earth.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|This is the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  I cannot express adequately enough how much my wife and I loved this movie.  It is one performance after another, but it is unlike anything you have ever seen before.  The only sound coming from us during the movie was one expression of exclamation after another.  It is truly magnificent and should be required viewing for everyone!
B000HF0KXU|2.0|The picture and sound quality are not at all good.  We could watch it with great difficulty.  I don't recommend to rent this from here.
0062082353|5.0|Good read. I have loaned it to several people who enjoyed it as well.  Very interesting book that gives a different perspective.
B00881PTRC|4.0|the animation is a huge plus - it's fun to watch him do &#34;his thing&#34;, get mad at you when you get it wrong, etc.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Simple, easy to use.  I'm not one that needs a lot of fancy options.  I want something functional.  So far I have nothing but good to say about this app.  I recently used it to keep track of all of my questions and concerns for my yearly medical check-up.  I kept needing to update the list as my mind would randomly remember issues throughout the day.  It was quick and easy to access and update the note I had started.  I was able to go through the list with my doctor.  It was perfect.
B0070DOHQS|3.0|... but in all fairness, it could be my system, or my internet connection.  But it makes my PC unusable - I can't just leave it on on the background, I have to shut everything off; and sometimes I forget to turn it back on before leaving, and then I can't use it.  But if I access it from the tablet, it's pretty cool - slow, but cool.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I fell in love with the story - with him...and with her. What a sweet and touching love store with such an insightful ending
030758836X|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading this book while simultaneously being glad that I'm not married to the author!  Seems to me that the controversial ending is quite open-ended, as I can \\"read\\" the ending with different interpretations depending on my mood at the time.  I suspect that Alfred Hitchcock would have loved this book.  Could Hitch and I both be wrong?
B005TVYVI2|4.0|I had the lower model, the Tempo Trainer (not Pro), and I could hardly hear the beap in the water.  Not only that, if it slipped off of my goggles strap, it would sink to the bottom of the pool.  With the Temp Trainer PRO, I can hear the beap when I swim, and if it happens to fall off of the strap, it floats.
B004AQX0R0|5.0|Eddie Vetter and Pearl Jam are at their best here and every fan needs to have a copy on CD, IPod or whatever device like it, cellphone, and now it's on my new Kindle. If I have a bad day only classic Pearl Jam can make it better.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I liked this movie as well as The Tuskegee Airmen, both of which are about the 332nd Fighter Squadron in WWII.  They were outstanding fighter pilots and did an awesome job protecting the bombers that flew missions in Europe.
B009CG9CXO|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since the day it first came out. It's always fun to watch even with the mechanical shark! It had to have the honor of being the first movie I downloaded onto my new Kindle Fire HD!
B000HF6ZR0|4.0|Decent adaptation of the book. Although the book is better in my opinion. Great acting by all of the actors.
B0071MQBX0|3.0|It isn't what I expected.  I love the singer but the sound is off since it was filmed on a stage.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I bought the app for $.99 and after playing it I would have paid more !! Hour's of fun,  I cant put it down !!
B001RNO7AI|5.0|Best pair of shoes I have ever owned.  The front of my feet are wide and this is the only shoe with a toe box that fits me.  This is my second pair and the first pair I have worn for two years and they still won't die.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I have learn a lot about the fish and plants in the game I did not know. It is addictive game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. you have to move on to the new levels much like current apps out today except there are all different types of games to play. some fun,  some boring,  some impossible to beat, but its fun to find out what's next
B006LSZECO|4.0|A little like a lifetime movie but a nice break if you have been reading serious books or articles lately.
6303014100|5.0|Good but some of the dialog sound fake. The acting is just OK. It is the subject matter that makes the movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent read.  Probably the toughest realization that a parent would have to face, that their offspring was a bad seed
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am definitely tweeting more since I downloaded this app!! That's saying something because I thought Twitter was ridiculous now I m tweeting away. Chirp, chirp.
B00BUCXVPI|3.0|As a dyed in the wool Jack Reacher fan I was concerned about the choice of Tom Cruise to portray Jack.  But I'm glad I gave it a chance.  Through subtle and not so subtle camera angles the short stature of Tom is concealed.  Though he never appears to be 6'5&#34; and close to 250 lbs like the fictional Jack, the film is enjoyable as pure escapism.  There are touches of unexpected humor and lots of action.  All in all enjoyable but just doesn't quite make it to the spirit of Lee Child's Jack Reacher.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The book is excellent, the writing style is refreshing and though some of the quotes seem just thrown in, all were relevant to the subject of the book. My only grouse for the whole book comes simply because I am a Jamaican. Pam quoted  Bob Marley but credited a bumper sticker with the quote. I was very disappointed because the rest of the book seemed well researched. I wasn't too pissed to not read the rest of the book though, and I am glad I finished it. A great read. One for the archives of all law of attraction practitioners.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Very good movie.  Ending could have been done better, but a good solid movie with McConaughey doing a very good job.  Excellent supporting cast.  Very familiar faces and surprised to see so many of them in one movie.  A good Saturday night - date night movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Finally a good old fashioned show about real scandal! The interaction between the house and staff is exquisite and deliciously addictive. Can't wait til next season!
B003O86FMW|3.0|It's readable, will appeal more to teen fantasy readers than older readers.  If you liked Hunger Games, its pretty much more of the same.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|my wife is aHarry Potter fan so of course I had to continue the collection.  now she has them all
B007A4SDCG|3.0|The author has a really important message to expose to those who are still in that &#34;dreaming&#34; state of mind, rather than &#34;do it now&#34; state of mind. I feel that it is a very significant message because it is so true. Too many people today are dreamers instead of doers. A splash of cold truth in the face helps realize that and hopefully once realized, one can be a doer. I enjoyed the book until the author starting talking about Muses. Still, it is a good read.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is awesome and I recommend it to all lovers of the zombie myth. This book is really like cloud atlas with its several stories of individual people. Buy this book, you won't regret it.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|Yet I can not understand what happened with this DVD, I bought arrived safely, the box and the disc looked great, but not reproduced the disc just arrived, I saved for a while longer. As I was watching the movie, I put the disc in the player and find it is not the film, which contains recording is poor quality juice telesales business for you. But it was too late to report this and return the disc, it was my mistake, but do not understand if it is a scam or what. In any case when you buy the first thing you should do is play the disc and check that all is well, otherwise, return it to the seller.
B00932A4XE|3.0|It was an fairly entertaining movie, but nothing special. It had its funny moments, but was very predictable. The script was a little weak.
0307594009|5.0|In the opening few pages, we are almost led to expect a bourgeois navel-gazing foray into dialectical materialism. Not so. This existential meditation is no Marxian analysis, no prescription for class action; The Dairy of Anne Frank is the pulse-pounding tale of a young prostitute torn between the past and the future. The delicate songcraft of the following passage particularly haunts me: \\"Tomorrow I shall eat iced cream. I haven't decided between vanilla and chocolate. Oh, my life is very much full of troubles.\\" A pitch-perfect thriller.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Matthew does a phenomally good job as a L.A. &#34;Defense Lawyer&#34; in this suspense thriller.  Just the right amount of both sleaze and pinache to work the court system as well as a client who tries to outwit him.  Ryan Phillipe is a believeable &#34;Choir Boy&#34; type character with a dark soul.  The movie is very reminiscent of the 1996 Richard Gere movie &#34;Primal Fear&#34; in many was, however this is the much updated version.  If you like movies with a definate &#34;twist&#34; to them then this one won't dissappoint!
B004JMSIRC|4.0|Great movie, arrived on time. My reason for 4 stars, instead of 5.  The sound seemed to be very low in the movie, except for fight scenes.  But that's how most movies are these days, yeah? :)
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|It contained Flurry analytics (another word for possible spyware), earlier, but they removed the permission required for the most intrusive form of monitoring after enough bad reviews.  Be careful if they turn it back on.<br /><br />Game is OK, but the physics of going straight away from the planet you're orbiting, instead of along a tangent to the orbit are odd.  If you want to get to a high level, you either grind for stars, or buy the stars using in-app purchase.  Hard to get to high level without buying stars unless you just want to play forever, one run at a time.<br /><br />Tons of low-priced games seem to be going this way, get in cheap, pay more if you want to have fun.<br />Wish there was a way to tell amazon to let me search for games that have no IAP, so I can find games that don't keep begging me for money every time I play.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use Pinterest nearly every day and just love what I get from it!  My friends and family all know when I get a new recipe, 95% of the time, that is where it came from.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This is my favorite Carole King album. I can now listen to all my the great songs on the computer or on the go.
B000S1LUE6|5.0|I lost my companion and tried dating, but forgot how to treat people in a loving way.  This book brought back the memories I had forgotten through association and taking things for granted.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves this movie.  I think it has a great overall message and very entertaining.  Some areas maybe a little scary for some kids.
B008JFUO36|4.0|I saw this movie last week in the theater and I liked it (hence the 4 star rating).  I'm not a big movie snob so every movie doesn't have to be an Oscar contender for me.  I'm just looking for a fun time at the movies so I usually go into a movie like this hoping for some good action and some cool visual effects.<br /><br />Oblivion does not disappoint when it comes to the great visuals.  Overall, the story was pretty good.  Some of it was predictable and I am usually pretty good at predicting what is going to happen next, but I honestly was pleasantly surprised at a few of the twists in the movie.  I saw it coming, but not in the way that I expected.  With this movie, you get some pretty cool future tech vehicles and weapons and some good action.  Overall, the story was a little confusing at first, but was pretty clearly explained in a few short flashbacks, which doesn't leave you going \\"huh?\\" at the end of the movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, Oblivion is one of those movies that I'm glad I saw.  I'm not sure that I need to see it again, so I'm on the fence about buying it.  It is a pretty typical Sci-Fi movie.  If you go in just looking for a decent Sci-Fi flick, you probably won't be disappointed with this one.  It looks great in the theater, so that would probably be your best if you can make it out.  Otherwise, it is definitely worth a rental, and possibly a purchase.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I have heard great things about this movie and had to get it.  My daughter loved it and my husband was glued to the TV!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|You certainly need to read all the other 13 books,but well worth the effort.<br />Enjoyed every book sorry it has finally finished
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is easy for my 3 year old daughter to play and keeps her entertained.  It also keeps my husband and I entertained too!
B008FPOIT6|1.0|Trite popculture elements boringly managed.  Regrettably, just not well written.  Neither style nor plot won the day.  Kept waiting for it to get good and interesting, since the premise was intriguing, but it just never did.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|A movie about the struggles of a genius that becomes happier after harming himself. A dark, violent, and strange movie.
B00BR9ULKM|5.0|....DO IT NOW....COME ON, COME ON, DO IT.... KILL ME!!!<br /><br />Just my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger line.<br /><br />The book is written as if Arnold himself did the editing....I'm not complaining....I'm a big fan.  I've only read through the first 75 of an approximately 500 pages, but I'm excited to read more!<br /><br />The book came as expected and in the time frame provided.  Thanks to the seller!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Tv needs to have more series like this! One of the top tv shows I've seen in a while! Can't wait till season 2!
B002QYSZBO|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun but don't expect, well, anything you might expect. Just let go and enjoy Robert Downey Jr. in his first role after leaving prison; his performance is delightful. The plot is a modern vision of a film noir without the noir, just old-fashioned gumshoe detective gets in trouble again and again. There is some random shootings and such but not what I'd call violent, although some may find it a little death-heavy. So were the Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow novels. Enjoy.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Great read, hard to hear all the hard details of growing up without a hint of love in his life or independence in hers
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Another great adventure,loaded with detail from Tom Clancy. If you like Clancy,this is a great addition to your library. Buy today.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Excellent movie!  Great family entertainment.  Sandra Bullock is outstanding in this role!!!  More like this needs to come from Hollywood.
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|I forgot how witty 'Play It Again, Sam' really was. Though directed by Allen's friend, the pace of the film is astonishingly comfortable. In fact, it ages well for this reason. Unlike 'Bananas' or 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex,' this film does not hurry through its funny moments, nor does it hit you with a barrage of gags. It is even keeled. I highly recommend 'Play It Again, Sam.'
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I loved Dr. Who as a kid, but the &#34;newer&#34; Dr. Who - starting here with Season 1 - is awesome.  Going back and re-re-watching it to get my fix as the BBC s-l-o-w-l-y rolls out the second half of Season 7.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|The plot, Cast, and special effects were well conceived and researched..although quite a few differences from the original Norse Mythology version, this movie was entertaining and,  if you were a comic book reader as a kid, then you
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is amazing I like how it lets you you breed dragons you can&quot;t afford so your not have to buy gems and money
B009AP2G26|5.0|I love this show. The talent, the music, the fun! A show that hits on a lot of emotions....fun! I can watch these shows over & over again
B0094LZY2A|4.0|I love this movie.  It is a timeless classic in my opinion. Although not for really young because it doesn't seem to keep their attention.
B007A6XLDU|4.0|Reads files from SD card and allows changes to the file and those changes can be saved. Having some trouble with changing font size and style but I know it can be done because it showed up once. There must be some easy way to get to &#34;how to&#34; files.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is such a classic about teenage years. It's written with a lot of sensibility. Although it explores very heavy themes, like homossexuality, bullying, drugs, child abuse, etc, it also explores the power of friendship and the importance of it to go through such a hard period.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|It's great. Just see it. Enjoy it. Don't think too much about it. Life is crazy. People are crazy. Love triumphs all. I can't believe I wrote this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|At this time, everyone must know that this is one of the greatest books of 2012 and blablabla, but it really is. Because it's YA, the content is very deep, but the language is simple. The characters are very well build, so you can relate to them and cheer for their story. In no time, you will fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus. It's the kind of book that you will want to finish in one night.
1484022858|3.0|Note: I am reviewing this particular edition, not the story.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that the original Hugh Thomson illustrations are beautiful, especially the peacock cover. However, this paperback reproduction is amateurishly laid out. The images (scans of a copy of the original hardcover from 1894) are generally low-quality. Most are grayish and slightly soft, not black and crisp-lined like ink drawings should be. At least one is horrendously pixellated (page 291, which is unfortunately and probably intentionally not in the 'Look Inside' preview). The cover is also very slightly fuzzy, although it isn't noticeable from a distance. It's lightly embossed like the hardcover, but you are not likely to notice unless you turn the glossy cover to the light. The edge of the front cover's image extends onto about a fourth of the spine, which reveals either messy laziness or the work of someone unfamiliar with laying out book covers.<br /><br />The text is 1.5x or 2x spaced, and there is a little room in the margins to write, which makes it a decent choice if you need to annotate it for class or something of that nature. The italics, oddly, seem to have been replaced with all caps. I can't say whether this is the way it was in the hardback or not, but it seems a little weird.<br /><br />Overall, I'm disappointed in the quality. I bought this as a gift, and I'm actually debating on whether to give it or not. At the price it's at right now, (about $19) I'd say skip it. It's definitely not worth that. Maybe $10. Maybe.
193700788X|1.0|DON\\"T BUY THIS BOOK!  This final book in the series was the most awful disappointment that I almost don't know what to write here.  The story was boring and dull and I couldn't wait for it to be over.  It felt like Harris had a binding contract to do one last book and her head is no longer in the game.  But surely, she has some obligation to the many readers of this series who made her rich and famous?  I feel like I've been ripped off.  The plot introduces the devil, well, not THE devil, but a devil.  Oh really?  The real devil here is reaching into your pocket to take your money for this drivel.  DON\\"T BUY THIS BOOK!  Am I clear?
193700788X|1.0|Listen, I'm not upset about who Sookie chose in the end. Despite what people may say, almost all fans saw it coming (though we could wish for something different). The thing that is making people so upset is that Charlaine completely DESTROYED the most beloved character in her series just to make her crappy ending work. Almost every other character gets either a nice or at least fair ending. But our hero is left with absolutely nothing, forced to be a slave to some horrible woman, having to leave everything he loves behind.<br /><br />I will never ever read a Charlaine Harris book again.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I was really impressed.  Originally bought it because I knew I like one song and it was a great price.  I love every song on this album!
B001QJUX24|5.0|John Wayne at his best.  As a true fan of John Wayne you will want to include this film as part of your library.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played. I recommend that you should get it off you like buying animals in games.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this app is a good game but this game you have to wait and wait for food to Dinah that is what I hats
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|This is my favorite book about Henry Chinaski's story. You can clearly see It all begins here!!! Very very good.
B008602KQI|5.0|A avoided this movie based on my belief that it was just another one of those movies. I was completely engulfed once the movie started and it held my attention all the way through.
B0094LZY2A|3.0|To be honest, we watched it mainly to see the out-of-breath rhino in the stampede.  Decent movie overall with some pretty hilarious sequences given that it's something of an action thriller.  An oldie but a goodie.
0743270754|5.0|Well researched, the book really focused on the men who served the country at one of its most critical times. It also brought to light the incredible intellect of Lincoln and his mastery in bringing different idealogies together for one common cause
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I was hesitant to get into Dr. Who and wasn't sure if I'd like this Dr., but wow! I devoured this season and was very disappointed when it was over.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Michael Buble at his best. I was not disappointed with this CD. I absolutely loved it. I would have to say by far my favorite song was \\"Close Your Eyes\\". Its one of the songs that I play over and over.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An amasing Catnis strong caracter, full of doubts to her inivatable role in her society. Triumphant in the end. Brilliant
B0031Y9DPU|4.0|This book confused me at first. So many characters all mingling together, with their too deep view. When i got the fog out of my head, and managed to read it, i couldnt put it down. And after a while i got to telling the characters apart as well.
B000002LSV|5.0|You cannot go wrong with these boys from TEXAS..MY SONS LIKE LISTENING TO THIS STUFF. WE SIT AROUND<br /> AND YELL! CHEAP SUNGLASSES  when they  are misplaced.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|There were moments when the direction was too sentimental, but I really enjoyed it.  Kept my attention, even though I knew how the story ended.  I also found myself wanting to watch scenes again the next day.  I do feel that it could have spent more time on the local population rather than the wealthy foreigners.  Overall a good tale of survival with realistic characters.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I wish there were more songs on the CD.  It is good, and found a few more favorites.  He did good work.
B008MM9630|2.0|I just started playing so don't know for sure if I like it or not. So far it is ok. Not quit what I exspected. I quit the game. For false advertising. It is free to download but then u have to spend money to play the game as it should be played. So really it is  not  free. I had to drop it to a 2
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It's a fun game but I wish they added more to it.  It has a good base but in the movie they don't just fly around.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark grabs you in the first few pages and doesn't let you go until the last pages.  She did it once again with this book.
B000FC11A6|2.0|I could not take the constant math formulas. My eyes glazed over as they went on and on. Obviously , a math wiz needs to read this book. Good story, just a difficult and boring read . I was glad when I finished.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Love love loved it!!!!!! A excellent read....<br />I recommend this to ages 12+<br />Also you don't need to read the Percy Jackson series although I did..
B0074YVW1G|4.0|I found that I recognized myself in the descriptions. However, I seem to be without friends and family that are extroverted. Which seems weird. Anyway, it does help to get to know myself and others around me better.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Well this season ending with a pretty dramatic cliff-hanger so I am excited to see how it will pick up in season 5. The interplay between Dexter and the Trinity Killer in this season was great, and John Lithgow was an incredible addition to the cast for this season.  He was so creepy!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I never thought that reading actual literature could be fun. This is. Do not read if you hate reading about the second world war.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|My boyfriend and I have been blowing through these seasons of Dexter so quickly.  It's a great show with a lot of action and it doesn't take itself too seriously which I enjoy.  Would recommend.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It is not what I would have thought. Most Epic Fantasy novels are way more explicit. I would not buy it again.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great entertaining funny show. Can't wait to see the next show every time I watch it. Next season yes yes.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The story was somewhat like the The Help. Enjoyed how the story twisted and turned.you got to hate characters and love others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I seriously love this game! It's so much fun! I encourage you to get this app because you will be hooked the first time you play!! BUY IT!
B0054W4JQK|5.0|I love when you start a book and your instantly in the midst of it all. Realalistic, fast moving, a riverting thriller from begining to end. It would make a great movie. G
B00957T6X6|5.0|A great way to buy the series if you are wanting to get into it.  My only two comments on the purchase:  I would like to be able to lend the book out to others (for the money you pay, I feel like that should be a perk for 5 books).  For instance, allowing my wife and I to read at the same time without dealing with all of the syncing issues between the devices.  Also, I wish the series was divided into individual books and not one continuous monstrous thing.  But like I said, overall a great purchase.
B000XT1P3E|3.0|I love both of these movies! I was just a little disappointed because there was a defect on the very beginning of the &#34;Erin Brockovich&#34; DVD, on the one I got. It will become slow and there's no sound for about 2 minutes, and then the rest of the movie is fine..... No problems with Notting Hill.
B000059TFO|5.0|I was required to read this for a college course on Rights in America. It was brilliant and moving. I think this is Gene Hackman's finest role. If you want to understand the civil rights movement in the south, you should experience it in a way a textbook or a lecture can never provide. It serves as insight into why so many people, not just from the South, were willing to put their lives (literally) on the line.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Tim Ferriss does it again. A must have for anyone interested in his previous books. If not interested in hacking learning, the recipes and guide to cooking makes this a powerful tool for anyone looking to improve their cooking.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|We were surprised.  We are big Reacher fans.  The little guy made it work.  pretty faithful to the book.  Really enjoyed it.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|I like this game a lot but it is not one that I have a hard time putting away.  It is cute and fun and my daughter enjoys playing it with me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing. It showed both good sides and bad sides of middle school and how things may seem bad right then, but it always get better.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Ali had the courage to leave town and start her life over this is a movie i would recommend to everyone it was insightful
B003RV43X4|4.0|good effects, plot seemed rushed, did not feel like the original at all. 7 more words required for this dumb review.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I liked this movie because everything batman went through he did not give up he continue to fight for what he believed in
B00821OX98|5.0|I love science fiction.  I love the possibilities of how we would react to an alien invasion.  I would recommend this series to everyone.
B0034G4OUO|3.0|I think Dwayne Johnson charater could have settle thing better than killing everyone it was brave of him to get revenge for his brother. But i would still recommend the movie
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Patience in pursuit of love is always becoming. Why, indeed, is the quiet sister preferred in love as opposed to the mouthy one.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Well worth the watch. Makes you think about a huge component of our daily lives that we never really consider.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|First of all there were no gaps in the dialogue and there was a continuous flow of subplots. Secondly the acting was superb.Each episode presented different challenges.<br />  My criteria for an excellent series is that you can look at the series more than once and still pick up the real hidden subplots that you missed the first time.
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|From beginning to the end this story captures you too the point where I didn't want to finish it because I didn't want the story to end.  I think a follow story is needed from this author.
1451695195|4.0|I thought this was very interesting-because the author is a neurosurgeon, he knows (and provides) a lot of scientific evidence for what he writes.  He seems very credible.  Uplifting!
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great thinking movie. Impressive that this subject can be done in a way that caused the entire theater to leave in silence.
B0027ZGPDC|1.0|Not that any of The Fast and Furious franchise movies were good, this one in particular, is bad. Terrible acting, writing, and the story doesn't make much sense. The first one was decent, this one is not.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best book ever for us<br />It guides,provide wisdom,give peace,provide clarity.<br />A blessing to anyone who follows the words.God is good all the time
193700788X|1.0|**SPOILERS**<br />I have followed the Southern Vampire Series for years, every May expecting to read about Sookie her world and her adventures. She became not just a fictional character but a contemporary even a friend. I was sad that Sookie's story was ending with book 13 DEA, but now I am not sad, I am dissappointed, and angry. Mrs. Harris what the heck were you thinking with this ending? I was always team Sookie and because I was for her I wanted her to have a good ending. Sookie did not come full circle, after 12 years of dealing with the supernatural world she ended up right where she started. Also, I was and will always be a fan of Eric, the best fictinal character you have created and will ever create. This male proved himself over and over to care for her, to protect her, to proviede for her and what did u do to him? (Who else took a bullet to the chest x3!!, a rock to the head, fought with weres and fairies, stood by her side during the bombing, cared for her in Dallas and after she was stabbed in Club dead, did you forget that? You wrote it!! Most importantly when her greatgrandfather revealed himself to Sookie, who did he choose? He chose ERIC NORTHMAN!!! Not Sam, Not Bill. This was your creation but I will disagree with other readers, once your work is published it becomes ours as well. If you wanted to end Eric, why not do it an a more compassionate way. I really believe since you could not kill BILL (you said it yourself you planned a beautiful death by sword for him in book 9 but the higher ups told you to keep him alive thereby loosing your control over your main characters), I am sure you heard the same for Eric. Since you could not kill him like a petulant child you gave him a worst ending than death. You took his freedom, his love, his progeny and just to plunge the dagger deeper into the hearts of fans, you had to make it for 200 years! Because 100 years at the servitude of his maker Appius Ocella was not enough, you had to double it. To those readers who say he got what he wanted \\"power\\" I counter, what power? He was 1000 yrs old, if he wanted power he would have been king a long time ago. But no, he did not want that, he wanted the right to his life, to love. Charlaine realized she had created a beloved character and over the past 2 books tried to destroy his character. What the hell was that about Eric thinking of turning Sookie into a vampire? Did you forget her told her in past books, he would never turn her even if he wanted to, even if her life was in danger. He was no villain, he is a freaking hero, who else would give up everything to offer her protection, if that is not the ultimate sacrifice, I do not know what is. As far as Sookie, I did not recognize her anymore. What happened to the young, independent, vivacious woman we came to know and love in the first 9 books. She was set to prove Appius wrong \\"You would not keep him\\", I had hoped she would fight, she would claw her way to happiness, instead chose to go with a whimper, to settle, because \\"sarcastic tone\\" she cannot read Sams thoughts anymore. OH NO!! another contradiction. Well I am done with this series, with her work. \\"Fool me once shame on you, Fool me twice shame on me\\" Never again Mrs Harris, never again.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I am not much for playing games but this one is  interesting and a challenge to keep my mind active, which is something I always want to do.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Loved Les Miserables!  Went out and bought the CD since I didn't see it at the movie theater.  The only thing I didn't like in the book were all the details that Hugo went into.  As one example, the information about the sewer system in Paris. On and on and on!  I skipped much of that information.  I kept wanting to get to the real stuff to see what was happening with all the characters!  I cried at the very end of the book!  So sad!  But I loved the story anyway!  Much reading but I read it in a week!  Can't wait to watch the movie!
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.<br />Enjoyed the songs,music and talent.<br />PG 13 rating but did have more adult themes than I expected.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest because of the myriad of great ideas I get for the home, recipes, decorating, and the humor.  It's an addiction!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|It's nice to make it more challenging playing with this app using Facebook. But should not be a requirement. That should be optional since it needs Wi-Fi and Password to play. A person isn't always with wi-fi signal to play a game.
B009K2SLYG|5.0|obviously, the film is a household word, the HD was beautiful, it was as I remember it.  well done, I think.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A friend recommended this novel and I am so glad I picked it up for my Kindle!  For those of us who know MOST OF US have some dysfunctional elements to our family life you will delight in the discoveries these two find in themselves and with one another.  I have not seen the movie but understand it is excellent too.  I did not find SLP depressing but enlightening and uplifting.  I seldom rate 5 stars but did not hesitate with Mr. Quick's excellent work
0805095535|4.0|Paul Auster has put in words what many of us ponder as we move forward through time. It does not bother me that the journal jumps back and forth through random periods of his life to present day. It adds to the emotional paths we travel while moving along in life. Although I am 10 years junior than Paul Auster, the story is a confirmation that others have gone this way before me.<br />As a male I share many of the same feelings and books like this and songs like \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\" are reminders that getting older is a big responsibilty that can be a burden but also bring joy.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I didn't want it to end!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I liked this movie and everything about it was great except ,the entire movie was about trying to push politicians into voting to free the salves(13th amendment). The FACT IS...... Lincoln didn't think this was the most important thing in his term of office to handle. He wanted to maintain a unified United States at any cost. He said at one time, if freeing the slaves meant keeping the union together then so be it, and if NOT freeing them kept the union together then so be that as well.<br /><br />Personally he was against slavery for sure, but the movie made it out like this was a do or die issue when it wasn't. He wanted to end the war and preserve the country under one flag is the real story. Why Hollywood seems to feel they can't ever tell the truth is beyond me unless it's just that the truth doesn't usually make for good stories perhaps and doesn't produce as many hero's.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is great - so glad that I can now play this on my Kindle Fire and not have to only play on the computer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you think you might possibly have it figured out, this book spins you around so fast, you're left with whiplash thinking &#34;what just happened? I didn't see that coming at all!&#34;-IN A GOOD WAY! I'm never one to jump on the novel bandwagon and read something just b/c it's popular at the moment but in the case of this wonderfully written book, I wish I would have jumped on a long time ago! It's a popular book for a very good reason! I expected this to be another sad whodunit tale but it was not at all expected and was so much more! I read this book in less than 2 days and I'm a stay at home mom with a 4 yr old, a 2 yr old and a 1 yr old so that's saying something! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I wasn't satisfied with the ending and *SPOILER ALERT-don't read this if you haven't finished the book yet* but the part where she told him she was pregnant confused me. How did she know it was a boy, how was her belly swollen already? Had she known for a while she was pregnant? I felt like the end was a little rushed and didn't use the same amazing detail she used in the rest of the book and left me with a lot of questions. But hey, I'm still thinking about the book aren't I? So, mission accomplished!
1607066017|5.0|Brian K. Vaughan's book is a mastery of intrigue, uniqueness and depth.  Fiona Staples' artwork is stunning and accompanies the story like a glove.
B00138H1MS|5.0|the best of the best. All of my favorite Elvis songs. sound quality is awesome. going to be listening to this for years to come. The king lives!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Great show. I love the character development and the way the show captures the cultural changes of the 60's. Women are  beginning to get their voice and place at the table in corporate America.  Wishing that the show will continue for many more years.

B002C949AE|5.0|Totally engrossing book about the incredible journey Waris made from a very difficult nomadic life in Somalia to becoming a top model.  Everyone should also read this book to understand the horrors of female circumcision.  Do whatever you can to support efforts to stop this cruel practice.
B000002UVX|5.0|Pinnacle of Jimi Hendrix's career. Hell, pinnacle of electric guitar performance of all time. It's seriously that amazing. You will not regret this purchase!!!! It may not be the Hendrix you know from radio stations, it is so, so much better. I used to debate with people about Jimi's accolades as an artist until I heard this album. It changed everything.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I really did enjoy this books.  Reacher is such an interesting moderan man.  But I do hope that the author will cantinue writting his adventures.  In this book in the end the reader was left to think that Reacher didn't make it. Needed to be left with a little hope.  I'm just an old lady but I have trully enjoyed all of the Reacher Books.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Leaves you guessing from start to finish. Sexy drama that cannot be overlooked in its very real premise that terrorist cells can and will threaten our safety at home. Originally created as tel aviv programming and well adapted to US emotions and fears post 9/11
B00AB7HESI|5.0|awesome game.easy to play and verrrrry addicting. i never write reviews but this game was so awesome i found it necessary.hope to see more levels come out soon!
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Typical Ken Follett it was easy to read it flowed with ease and kept you absorbed. the caricatures were real and believable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. I also loved the price. Everywhere else such as itunes wanted so much more. So 5.99 was a great deal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games extermaly fun. Also it is enjoy able and never gets boring. PLAY THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!! Or die<br /><br />  ha ha ha
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was by far one of the best movies I ever bought. I got the 3D version for my  Panasonic 65 inch plasma 3D TV. This movie was just as good or better than the IMAX one. Plus, I didn't have to stand in line or listen to any annoyances from others.  and the best part is,...I got it for only $19.95 with the DVD and the blu ray 3D and regular version. It was A LOT cheaper than paying the $125.00 they wanted when it first came out. Sorry to all you fools who paid that much. I guess it just goes to show,... Patience is a virtue, lol.
B004IV5AKM|5.0|A movie to be watched over and over again. Martin Landau is the best and his scene stealing makes the movie all that much better.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|If you like action with lots of special effects and comedy, this movie is great!! I hope part two holds up.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|Better organization and a more concise presentation would make for a better read.  The material could be presented more interestingly
B000BZISTE|5.0|Bought this movie to watch with my dad, definitely was not a disappointment since him and I haven't seen it in a long time
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|I've already seen the movie which was very good, so I mainly purchased this to see it in 3D. My mom and I both agreed the 3D wasn't as great as it could have been. We watched Tangled 3D and it had a lot more depth (constant throughout the film), while this had depth but not during every scene. There were also very few pop outs, but most 3D movies are that way unfortunately. Titanic 3D was really amazing though and still takes the top spot for me in terms of 3D blu-rays that I've seen.
B000002P86|5.0|I was looking for this in my country and I could not find it. Now I have it I recomend listen this great music. It arrived on time and in perfect state.
1451696191|5.0|This book is such a great coming of age tale. The main character is so dynamic. I think it's a must read for anyone that has ever felt like a loner, an outsider, someone who doesn't quite fit in.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Not funny, 65 years old plus Streisand fans may find this movie hilarious.  If your not one of those people, save your money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book brings about all the bad things people sometimes do. We fight we try to kill each other. Truthfully we are not that far away from things like this with fear factor, survivor and other reality shows like this. A lot of the things we do are just like the people of panem. We watch people Deion tv every day. Through the news. But what do we do a out it? For the most part, many of us do absolutely nothing. We watch. That's it.<br /><br />Through Katniss we learn that sometimes fighting is your only option. How odd that a 16 year old girl would be the savior of a country.?<br /><br />If more of us were like her, and less like the sheep we act like, maybe the world won't descend into the state that we are rapidly becoming.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just the basics to accustom you to matching tiles to be removed.  Once you get it moves down pat, venture on to Mahjong II.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It is written in a Diary form, which makes it lack connectivity.  It goes back and forth about the two main characters, which I did not like.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was the first of two that depicted life as seen thru the eyes of a dog. The trials of a racecar driver have a significant effect on family life and that is what the book is all about and how that affects the dog's rendition of this story. Hard to put this book down.
B008GJV19Q|5.0|The setting (a French village), the actors (Binoche and Depp), the story (mysterious woman and daughter show up and open a chocolaterie), the result (I won't spoil it)....what could be better!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|And the reason you'll be embarrassed is that you'll laugh out loud, if you're foolish enough to read it in public. I've lost track of the copies I've given to friends, so the Kindle version is an attempt to have a copy that I can actually keep. All the extensive footnotes are still in the Kindle version, but you have to touch the hot-link to read them, and then come back, which is a bit of a nuisance. On the other hand, there's probably no other way they could do it. The End of Days would be almost worth seeing, if it's anything like this!
B004EPZ07K|5.0|bought this for my son, and it was a wonderful family movie, all these super hero movies are great for kids.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Family determined to survive and reunite...<br />Stunning and at times disturbing scenes. Very realistic!! The children in this movie were amazing in their delivery of emotion. I cried a lot!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this version of solitaire on all of my portable devices.  Kindle; Pantech Aneroid phone; Asus tablet; iPod.  Best version of basic Klondike solitaire I have found.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Watched this with a friend who was told it was scary. Some of the parts were down right funny, corny. Better luck next time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Crossfire triology' first novel reflected in you was a pleasure to read. it was page turningly interesting to share Gideon's relationship.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game keeps me busy. Thanks for making fun in my life like I don't h<br />ave anything else to do when I'm bored
B001GXNBJW|5.0|I love this band.  I still can't believe these guys made music like this with just guitar and drums, but this is some freakin' cool rock & roll music.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I tried this one time, but it wasn't that interesting for me.  I only went through about 4 or 5 levels, and they seemed pretty easy.  I prefer solitaire, bejeweled, mah jongg, so I think it's just this type of game didn't appeal to me.  Graphics were okay, animation was good.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Easy to use....downloaded a song, but wasn't the full song, disappointed with that, but very easy to use and play songs on my phone.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awesome app love playing against friends. Addictive keeps you coming back!! Absolutely love it! More and more of my friends join in each day!
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I threw this on to fall asleep to---the story lines were mostly dumb but there were some pretty funny parts, especially if you're anywhere near this stage of life. I ended up watching the whole thing.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I am walking to loose weight and the stopwatch helps me to know how long I have been walking to meet goals that I have set for myself.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The acting was superb.  I can't imagine going through that Tsunami that day but this movie brings you so close to what it must have been like for just one family.  Full of action, emotion and human drama.  I would suggest this movie to everyone.
B004GYY714|5.0|Very good app for Internet radio live streaming. Gets almost all radio stations (US or Worldwide) you are looking for.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Bit of a twist, nice story line and it keeps you engaged in the plot.  Nice ending, and i think most will enjoy.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Would not buy the Kindle FIRE HD tablet based upon this feature.  The pictures are very poor quality and not worth keeping.  For pictures purchase an IPhone.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I can't wait for the rest of the story!!!!!!  Fantastic!  I'm as interested in the minor characters as the main ones.  The pace never lags.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great! Nice to have with me at all times. Very convenient. It's right there with me even when traveling. No need to carry a large dictionary or extremely small dictionary, it's all on my Kindle!
B009LDXQGW|4.0|The Weeknd takes.you on a dark twisted drug fueled ride to parties strip clubs and the recesses of his mind.The sound of the album fits sonically with the overall tone. And at moments straddle the line between genius and troubled. Highlights of the album include The Zone ft. Drake who makes the only guest appearance across the three albums. Wicked games and the host xoxo. It does include its share of profanity which can be a little off putting for a primarily r&b album. .But I was overall satisfied with the finished product.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams and Julia Roberts in a timeless classic that will not disappoint - What more is there to say?!
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|I had seen it before we bought it. So I knew what to expect! Recommended to anyone at any age group!
0525478817|4.0|Ordered it for a gift.  I have not read it myself.  The recipient seems to like it a great deal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very suspenseful book, but it also pulled at your heartstrings. You feel the emotions along with the characters. I was absolutely hooked on every word.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Fascinating .. although the first publication of this novel was in 1943, it is still absolutely rivoting!  I have it loaded into my Kindle, and haven't been able to put it down!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very suspenseful book, but it also pulled at your heartstrings. You feel the emotions along with the characters.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This I'd my go to game. Keeps me entertained for quite a while. WhiteHaven it on every device so must be good
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Interesting look into the making of tv shows and movies, on top of the fact that Tina Fey is hysterically funny.
0316017930|4.0|As a class, we had to negotiate the rating for this book. Some of us really enjoyed it, while others were confused and uninterested in it. The main point of the book is that we don't have complete control over our own success; instead, success requires both personal abilities AND external opportunities. Despite this, reading Outliers helped us think about the subject, pointing out the areas of success that we can control, such as the number of hours we practice a skill we want to develop. Throughout the book, Gladwell discusses the tools different groups use to achieve success, which offers the opportunity for readers to learn from other cultures. Gladwell's great talent is in discussing occurrences that are common to us, but pointing out new ways of looking at them. The example of the age of hockey players fits here. Some of us would have preferred a more linear organization to the book, instead of the way it tells story after story on the same theme. A more direct approach would have made the points clearer and easier to understand. Also, success means different things to different people; one of us wanted to hear Gladwell's definition of success, an obviously relevant point. Overall, we wanted to give the book 3.5 stars, and we would recommend that others read it so they can see success in a new way.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The graphics are amazing the game is very challenging good for hand eye coordination and reflex response very colorful too
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I picked the book but I couldn't let it down until I had finished it. Beautifully written in a simple way. And I don't know why, but whenever Parts Unlimited was mentioned, my mind replaced it with Amazon, Inc :-) I would recommend it for any corporate person. Go on, grab it and may the IT be with you
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Insightful and unique. A rare glimpse into the life and heart of a teenaged girl and her struggles in life. Excellent writing style.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Even though Hans Zimmer usually turns in good scores for most of the pictures he works on...I wasn't expecting to be blown out of the water. But I was. I've played this score over and over on my iPod at work so many times...it isn't even funny.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Although Harry Bosch's unraveling of this cold case is a bit plodding, the action heats up towards the end. The climax scene, however, wraps up too neatly and conveniently for Harry. Harry's relationship with his daughter and his constant battles with his supervisor are what make this cop procedural worthwhile.
B005ZHB84U|4.0|Though I liked Zimmer's music for the first Sherlock Holmes reboot more, this is almost as entertaining. I hope that he scores the next installment...if there is one!
0393327345|2.0|I've only ever heard great things about this book. I think it's cool that he wrote it on his lunch breaks, but for me, it was the same as the movie - I just didn't like it. I seem to be the minority on this one as everyone else seems to love it, but it just wasn't for me. It does some interesting things, and I can see how people find the twist cool and edgy and there's validity to the \\"that book is crazy\\" kind of comments, but I was just never engaged reading this book. I'm glad it was short or I wouldn't have finished it. I was often grossed out and baffled. I just didn't ever understand where the characters were coming from, and that's probably a big part of why this book didn't work for me. It is kind of a cool and original idea, but I'm not a fan. The whole book was kind of a long rambling essay about messed up stuff and ideologies that I completely disagree with. I've never really liked the mind trippy kind of stories though. A while back I read Alice in Wonderland because it's a classic and I like reading books I've heard about all my life. I hated that book. To me it was just a pointless ramble of random things. I didn't find it cool or trippy, just pointless. This book felt much more planned and purposeful in it's storytelling, but I was just not \\"getting it\\" - the whole time. If you liked the movie, which you probably did, you'll probably like the book. It just wasn't my cup of tea.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|The little ones like it and it grows a little with the child. I can almost leave the 2 year olds with it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Fantastic HBO series!!  Amazon makes it easy to caught up on a missed show that is no longer available on the Internet.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter who's five and I both enjoy this game. We fight over my kindle sometimes so I have it on both my phone and kindle so we can play at the same time.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Just purchased one missed episode.  No problem with downloading and watching it on my computer.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Loved this book -it was so very real reading this in her own words. Felt very connected to her and just couldn't put it down! She is an amazing survivor and I look forward to following her life in the future.  Thanks to JC for having courage to write this!!
B002VRZEYM|4.0|It really makes you think twice about what food had been reduced to in out country and what you're putting in your body. It was definitely the impetus to get my family and I eating cleaner, greener, and healthier.
0151003084|5.0|Warning: Not for those who do not enjoy dark humor. Edward Gorey is known for his dark humor books based on popular styles of children's books. I think it's cute. My favorite part is that it has my name in it. The artwork is fantastic, and Gorey is quite clever.
B005L193RO|4.0|Very good book, theoretical thinking supported by case studies. Practical implication at its best. A must for everyone interested in psychology.
B008F9ULFW|5.0|I got this for my dad for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! I think I'll get it for my brother next.
0345803507|5.0|I read all three and I loved them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the most addictive series I believe that my wife and I have ever watched! We enjoyed watching all the seasons so much that now we don't know what to watch now that its over. I guess we will just try to survive until season 4. If you haven't seen any of these seasons I highly rue commend it. Great story lines and character.
0345803493|5.0|The book arrived on time and is in excellent condition.  I have read all three books and this one is currently out on loan.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|great book i really liked it..i could not put it down. i really liked the characters they qall were awesome
B009MYAQK4|3.0|I LOVE Paulo Coelho. I do. I think he's a brilliant writer an a man with an outstanding message.<br />And the messages he offers up in this book are excellent. That's not the issue here.<br /><br />Perhaps it's Paulo's transition from story-teller to &#34;message deliverer&#34; that I find difficult to adjust to. There simply wasn't enough &#34;story&#34; here for me. And when the book ended, it was as if Paulo said, &#34;OK, I'm done, they'll figure it out&#34;. I like my authors to tie things up a bit, and in this case I felt it was incomplete.<br /><br />That said, the message of the book is worth the read, but I left feeling rather unsatisfied.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I struggled through all three books, found them extremely depressing, HOWEVER.. they are all extremely well wirtten and I just kept reading.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|It seems that the space could be utilized to allow larger display of cards.  The &#34;undo&#34; button works very well, but in other computer Freecell it has the capacity to undo quickly if the &#34;undo&#34; button is simply held down.  This Freecell moves one card for every button push.  The program could be improved also if it kept a count of all losses and wins with the percentage stated of wins against losses.  However, overall, it is worth playing and enjoyable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I struggled through all three books, found them extremely depressing, HOWEVER.. they are all extremely well wirtten and I just kept reading.
B0097K21YW|4.0|Starts off simple and has good OPTIONS like Sound, Speed and Timer settings.  It's  a very Enjoyable game with all kinds of interesting and Fun features that get much better after the first dozen levels.  You start off with Straight forward shooting of Fireballs and then get to significantly change the strategy; You can Bounce shots off rubber walls and plattsforms, hit TNT containers for mass destruction, shoot down Planes over the target area and drop boulders on targets by shooting the chains that support them.  There are also acquired POWER-UPS that you can use for better results.  You get UNLIMITED Fireballs.<br /><br />DRAWBACKS: The Target Sight is not as accurate as you would like so you have to adjust your shots.  However, Aiming is OK and it really is not a huge problem that you can't adapt to.<br />  No written Instructions but Picture Hints do help you figure things out well enough.<br />  Burning is slow so you have to wait for all burning items to disappear before you can get past them for more shots at other targets.  Requires complete destruction to complete levels.<br /><br />OVERALL: Nicelly designed with Good Controls, Great Options, Nice Music/Sound effects and Smooth, Fluid Physics that are Realistic and Fun.  Not like Angry Birds but a Good Alternative with it's own Addictive Fun style.  You can also Replay levels for higher scores.  Very Engaging and Satisfying Fun.  Glad I did not pass it up due to it's simplistic appearance. It's a KEEPER.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The show does a great job creating a world that we can believe existed. I can't wait to start season 2.
B00553U3HM|4.0|Informative , exciting couldn't put it down. Learn't a few things about Russia and the people I found extremely interesting.
0545265355|4.0|My husband and I both bought the books to listen to. I purchased this set for a gift for my daughter-in-law. She will be thrilled.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Creepy is good! I wish they would have more people who represent the diversity of America. I'd like to think race was not an issue. We need some mixture of other races in charge with major roles. Love this show but could experiment with more futuristic plots.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Easy to play.  I downloaded it to my Kindle fire and I just can't get enough of it.  I love to play it while commuting to and from work.
B0055S348W|4.0|It's nice to be able to print from my tablet but I wish more printers were supported.  My home Epson printer is only a few years old, no support. My color laser at work, no support.  It does work with a slightly newer Epson at work, and an older HP laser using a generic driver.  But it accomplishes the task.  I plan to leave it installed.
B007FTZDN8|4.0|I love TED talk, but in my kindle fire HD every time I play a talk it freezes it. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
B00CL6GAD2|2.0|I found it a bit hard to follow at times and a slow to move along. I suffered through to the end, but wished I had selected a different movie to watch.
B009R659L8|3.0|I find that Mary Higgins Clark's writing is more predictable than it used to me.  Many of her previous books were riveting.  However the last two with Elvira as the &#34;detective&#34; were so awful that I had promised myself never to buy another book of hers.  FYI I have all of her books so it was a hard decision to make.  I just didn't &#34;buy&#34; her stories and it seemed to me that she was just copying her daughter who is not half the writer her mother is.  HOWEVER, going back to Daddy's Gone A Hunting, at least she is back on track and hope she stays away from Elvira.  I know she is 84, and I wish her success since most of us would be delighted just to be alive at that age and she is still a viable author.
B000W11JGG|4.0|Love this album. Can't wait to download it and add it to my MP3 player! I highly recommend this album for any Elton john fans.
B00006LSM3|5.0|\\"Brainwashed\\" is both a happy and a sad recording at the same time. Although it was released posthumously, it was George's final project, with last minute tweaking by his son Dhani. The songs are touching and well written. Some of the songs seem to be about his impending death and his outlook toward his passing. I think this album is firmly in 2nd place, right behind \\"All Things Must Pass\\". I can't listen to this without getting choked up...
B0037UUZQY|5.0|Ordered for my niece for Easter and she loved it.  Said I was her favorite uncle.  She loves Rapunzel and her long hair.
1476734941|5.0|Looking for a diet to keep me healthy and prevent cancer, this is it! It is easy to fit into my lifestyle and makes sense to me.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana Gabaldon fills her pages with excitement and enough details that you feel as if you are right there!  As you finish one book in the series, you can't wait to read the next one.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Great stuff. A genuinely thrilling and dramatic conclusion to the first half of the series. Not many writers produce such well plotted and crafted stories with characters you can really care about.  Completely satisfying. Very happy with purchase and highly recommend it.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|Had to have it. All the actors are great, love the storyline, music, everything about the movie. I would tell everyone to get it.
B009K86D86|4.0|Must see if you really want to find out how the food makes it to your grocery store shelves...........You'll be a lot more careful about what you reach for.......
B004P12SSW|5.0|Everything about this movie is Great! Wish I could rate it higher. Cher is as always awesome, Christina is incredible, all the actors are the best. Love watching it and so glad I purchased it.
B000022TSY|2.0|We hadn't seen this movie in 20 years, bought it on a whim.  Turns out our powers of recall aren't as good as we thought.  We know that in some circles it's considered an American classic---after viewing it again we looked at each other & said &#34;boy that was really a stupid movie!&#34;  The plot is non-existent--there's some nice scenery and of course it's a product of the early 70's so if you're into that era or are a collector, add it to your collection.
B00BMT9SQA|3.0|I really like both the lead actors and really liked the previews but I thought once I watched it that was pretty much the humor for the whole movie. Not a bad movie just not what I thought it would be.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|This movie is one of those timeless Hollywood productions.  The special effects are astounding for their time, the story line is good and there is suspenseful drama, along with some humor.  It's a good family movie (if you're kids are over the age of 5).
B000FC130E|5.0|Well written. Quirky. A fun read. Neverwhere is in the genre of HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, only it takes place under the streets of London.<br />This book wasn't a disappointment. The main character is believable and loveable. The storyline is fantastical.
B00BIPMGD0|5.0|I got hooked on this show pretty quickly and was worried that the third season would start to feel old. But it didn't. This show never disappoints!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie has humor, emotion, and surprises.  This is truly one of the best movies me and my children were able to enjoy together.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This show is smart, and sometimes funny. I love it! Each episode leaves me waiting for the next - I'm totally hooked.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|A bit too long.  The author over burdens her case with more and more examples.  This book could have been reduced by 1/3 and made the same points.  Longer isn't always better.  While it is targeted at understanding introverts, I think it does an equally good job of providing understanding of extroverts.
B001NB4Z6K|4.0|Some of my favorites. Classic hits. Probably 85 percent, there is a couple I would not have included but overall pretty solid!
B009GX69RK|5.0|New Girl is my favorite new show!  Jess and her roommates seem like real people with weird problems and normal lives.  This season is just as good as the first (that can't be said of many shows...)  Hilarious and fun!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I'm hooked.  Love this show.  Twists and turns not expected.  Can't wait to move into Season 2 to see what happens!
B008IYSMLY|5.0|My husband and I watched the whole season in 5 days. We couldn't stop watching it. We couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next!!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This movie was very well written and produced.  I really enjoyed watching it and will probably watch it again sometime.
0345529057|5.0|Box set came new and exactly as shown in photo. Great value can't beat it! If you love the HBO series you'll love this set.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|This game is ok. I don't like that the reurgular levels are nit compatible with kindle fire. Also I think that the cheats shouldn't be used in the tournament but other than that it is ok.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|We have enjoyed every episode. The characters are real, the scenery beautiful, they did a good job casting all the rolls, the acting is good.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is the first book I have read written by this author and absolutely loved it.  Well written and couldn't put the book down.  I have already downloaded more of his books.  I wish I had discovered him sooner.
193700788X|3.0|You could see this ending a mile off. This book is not the greatest Sookie but the degree of venom and nastiness in these reviews is overwhelming. Many of these over-the-top reviewers need the advice that William Shatner told Trekkies--\\"Get a Life!\\"
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|ive been playing this game for days I cant stop. I love trying to get the achivments and suffering. this is fun
B00355L2TU|5.0|So much more convenient than driving to a gym. I recommend this for busy moms who need to make their workout & shower fit into nap time! Definitely a strength building program designed to melt the fat away. I bought the \\"watch instantly\\" version, can't beat the price.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not finished with the book yet, but so far it is really good.  Stephen King has evolved<br />as a writer, meaning he has multiple story lines going on and his characters have a lot more<br />depth than in his earliest works.  I love that he is blending sci-fi and historical fiction.  Makes<br />it very interesting!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Other than wishing it had an autoscroll feature it's a great app.  Also being that they have all your books there, when you go on amazon and buy something it should show &#34;already purchased&#34; for ones youve got.
B0080M3OGW|4.0|Star crossed lovers...great story. Both actors are wonderful and made it easy to believe. It was fun seeing them both much younger.

B00755MHXG|4.0|\\"He is the greatest... whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.\\"<br />These words by Henry Ward Beecher (19th Century abolitionist and clergyman), and quoted at Beecher Prep's graduation ceremony, quite adequately sums up 5th grader August Pullman's impact on his schoolmates and his family in the process of a single year.<br /><br />Auggie is just like any other 10 year-old boy, with an almost geeky obsession with the Star Wars franchise, financially privileged in the way some kids aren't, with uber-cool parents who joke and josh each other (and their kids), and a pretty and smart older sister, who dotes on him. In many ways, Auggies has a lot going for him. But he is different because he has never gone to school before 5th grade, and the initiation into a whole new environment that other kids are already familiar with can be a frightening and bewildering experience for anyone, not least for someone who suffers from an extremely rare cranio-facial deformity.<br /><br />R.J Palacio gets under the skin of Auggie, delivering most parts of the book from his perspective, as he navigates the big bad world of middle school. It is easy to get overly sentimental when writing a story about a disadvantaged child, but the author manages to make her story rise above it when she shifts the narrative to the other characters, and reveal their struggles as well. In fact, I felt the most poignant parts of the novel dealt with Auggie's sister, Via, and her contradictory feelings about her brother and how she copes with the attention her parents give him. Auggie's b best friend in school, Jack, was also quite well fleshed out.<br /><br />For a children's book, I think it was well-written, especially in the chapter \\"Letters, Emails, Facebook, Texts\\", which artfully revealed the aftermath of the blowup between Jack and Auggie's tormenter Julian. However the style of writing suffered a little in the last bit when Auggie took back the narrative, and it becamemore of a recount which reported dialogues and speeches. Nonetheless, highly recommended.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great read, I couldn't put it down!  Very unusual for non-fiction.  Not only a great tale of compassion during air combat, the research allowed the author to weave a compelling tale!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great intriguing series. Very in depth and well thought out characters. I was easily drawn in as any good show should do.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Was looking for a game like Candy Crush and I came across this one. I love playing it and find I have more fun playing Diamond Dash than any other game. Highly recommend DD to anyone
B00005JLT5|5.0|No matter how awful our lives may become, this movie is a great reminder of how worse things could be. Such a powerful story!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  The plot is good, the characters interesting and the story well written.  I couldn't put it down.  It kept my interest until the end.  I enjoy a good love story and this is one.

B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I do not choose to log into other sites to play a game.  I feel this is not the way I should be forced to play.
B0006J28BO|3.0|I'm sure that The Cat Returns is a really great movie and but I was sent Howl's Moving Castle instead so I can't really judge The Cat Returns. I do really like Howl's Moving Castle though.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The tech back ground at times over whelmed this blue collar brain of mine. But, it was a adventure in pure old time syfy. The human wits, quick thinking, and how the hero overcame the obstacles was a pure thrill ride. It is worth your time and money to go to Mars with this story.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I just need an tool to examinate my kindle and work with my files (watch them, move them, unzip them, etc.)<br /><br />This app works very well.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I've read all the books in the series and they are all great. After13 books we all have our hearts set on how we want things to end up for sookie. Personally I had my own hopes for the end of the series but it was still a great way to end sookies journey.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone, it holds your attention and you can hardly put it down!  I chose it because I love Nicholas Sparks books and I try to read them all.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Having hard time manipulating the system. I am thinking with time I will get better. Twittering is an interesting concept and I can only believe I will get better time
B008MG1E4A|4.0|About what was expected... I enjoyed the book and would select it again to read.. but would not re-read it
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a calculator. It does what it needs to. It also stores previous calculations. All in all, I am satisfied.
B0034CNSFU|5.0|Haven't listened to this yet--I'm sure I will like it. There isn't much else to say, since I haven't even opened it yet.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Pictures load to slow on kindle app. ALS a lot of links don't work with the kindle version of Facebook
B001AKTZO6|5.0|One of the classic all-time C C R recordings--was in my late teen when this was out and it has always been one of my favorite listenings , even today.
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|Beautiful picture wise, Dislike movies that leave ending questionable. I think that is a stupid way to make movies!<br />Also it dragged, I'm guessing, so we could enjoy the beauty.<br />It was a waste on my hard earned money
B0097K21YW|4.0|This game is very fun to play. It is easy at first but then changes to being just the right amount of hardness. If you are looking at this game get it while it's free. Trust me you will like it especially the power up fireballs in the levels.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Great story line and how they tied in the pervious movies.<br /><br />I just didn't like the ending it was just a clif hanger that left you wanting more.
0740797719|5.0|It surpassed my expectations, it's full of reference from classic artist as well as modern ones, and you'll never see color the same again while painting, I recommend it for anyone that is interested on bringing more realism to their paintings
B005ILYWN2|5.0|This is the kind of movie you have to sort of 'get' up front. If you're not into this type of movie you'll probably dislike it. It's shot documentary style with hand held cameras. Very reminiscent of 'Blair Witch' sort of thing. This Blu Ray version has both subtitles and you can turn on English dialogue. Special features aren't much, but it's the movie that you want. My son likes these and I bought it mainly to give to him as he missed it when it was in theaters. The kind of movie is for people who like the bit off kilter ideas and odd themes. I enjoy it but I know a lot of people who would not. It's all a matter of taste I'm sure.
1616550414|5.0|It was on perfect condition upon arrival, I buy it for my brother who is a huge fan of the series and he is more than pleased with it.
0385523912|5.0|Nothing to Envy is a book of non-fiction that tells a story about a country that is so impossible that it could only be fiction.  But the book is the product of investagive journalism and careful research. It tells the story of the ordinary citizens of North Korea, an almost impenetrable country.<br /><br />The author tells the story of six defectors from Chonjin that some hotw manage to make it to South Korea. Chonjin is a large city in the north of the country. It was especially hard hit by the famine of the 1990s and also has a reputation of being rebellious. She chooses to focus on one place in part to \\"control\\" for regional differences and in part because the city itself is quite interesting. Of course the \\"protaganists\\" are not an unbiased sample...they choose to defect, they had the means to defect, and they were lucky enough to survive. Of course, this excludes most ordinary North Koreans.<br /><br />The story is so fantastic with so many twists and turns that it reads like thriller. Will the defectors make it out of the country? Will they survive China and make it North Korea? What will they have to give up? We know that our defectors make it to freedom, we don't know (or even imagine) how and it is amazing to see what the defectors have to give up. It is a story both of triumph and sacrifice. The North Korea that the book describes, the view from the ordinary person, might as well be a dystopia out of [[ASIN:0452262933 1984: 60th-Anniversary Edition (Plume)]] with truth being the property of the state, scarcity being a tool of the states, and citizens being property of the state.
1933492953|5.0|You won't be disappointed in this book, it goes straight to the point and on a way that is easy to assimilate
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So many loose ends & plot lines to be resolved, ending a series of this magnitude! Lots of battles, of course, pretty much a requirement. But here's the thing: Sanderson is a really, really good author. From the series' start I enjoyed Jordan's ideas -- but Sanderson is a better writer. For example, all the power games between the genders that Jordan employed (didn't he have enough other material for conflicts? Really?) which were tedious & contrived feeling, Sanderson down plays into something more believable. And yes, this is not a writers' competition. But if you liked the series so far, it's even better with Sanderson at the keyboard.Thanks, Brandon, for being so good a story teller, bringing it all to a satisfying end! Kudos & keep writing: I'm already waiting for your next book!
B00A757EFW|1.0|Don't bother with this game...I downloaded the free app for my kindle and got to play for LITTERALY one minute before the game stopped and was prompted to buy full version...waste of time
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Sons Of Anarchy is a great series. This season is new exception. Awesome cast includes Katie Sagal who is amazing in this series
B004T340QY|5.0|Full of surprises and great musical harmony!  Have watched it twice and may do it again.  May result in the resurrection of bluegrass!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I keep reading King's books waiting for something that is the caliber of some of his earlier works.  Well here it is.  Amazing. Fantastic.  Spectacular.  Yes, if you are a Stephen King fan and even if your not, this is the book to read.  Genius.  Almost as good as The Stand which is my all time favorite book.  I wanted to savor every detail and didn't want it to end.  Read this.  You will not be disappointed.  The best.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Really now, guys, THREE disks plus an on-line copy? I'm sure it's just to jack up the price, when a disk costs maybe $0.50 (tops) to produce. I got a rude shock when I plugged the top disk into my player - I thought I'd accidentally bought the 3D version. Man, was I torqued! I noticed my error a few days later, but wow, was I upset!<br /><br />At least I can give the DVD to my daughter.<br /><br />The movie is visually fine. The plot is so different from the book that I really enjoyed it - I never knew exactly what was going to happen next! (Sorta like when I went to see &#34;The Firm&#34; at the theater with my wife.) I particularly liked the way Our Heroes can tumble hundreds of feet down a stone shaft with little or no damage...
0425263916|3.0|The story of Eva and Gideon continues. Now, this book didn't make me think of 50 Shades at all, thank goodness. Eva and Gideon are now going to therapy together and trying to work on their issues and the crazy relationship that they have.<br />Gideon is trying to understand why it is so hard for Eva to trust him and Eva just wants Gideon to let her in.<br />In this book, their relationship is such a roller coaster ride, I got motion sickness. So many things happen in this book, that just astounded me.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*****<br />Eva meets up with an old flame, who still has a little sizzle left, he actually wrote a song about her. Cary, the roommate is attacked, but why, no one knows. Nathan, the evil step-brother that molested and raped her as a child is found dead, and Eva didn't even know he was keeping tabs on her. Gideon stops communicating with her after an amazing weekend away. Her parents come face to face with each other for the first time in years. Gideon finally tells Eva, what she wants to hear, in more ways than one.<br /><br />I'm interested to know what is going to happen next for these too.<br />One great thing about this book compared to Bared To You, she doesn't use the C-word nearly as much!!!
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Jeffrey Archer uses his considerable knowledge of British politics in this entertaining, and at times humorous, novel set in the 1950's. He has managed to weave a page-turner from, in the main, the stuff of everyday life. And he does it so well!
