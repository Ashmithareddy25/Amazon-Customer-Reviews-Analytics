B00009NQQO|5.0|If your little one loves staying in the bath for long period here's a perfect toy for them. My baby loves it!!
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I tried the game out and I liked it.  game is very similar to pipe dream except you move tiles instead of twist them.  eventually you get to a point where you're mixing colors to make a new color.  I didn't find it challenging at all but it was a fun time waster.  has nothing to do with formulas lol, as an engineer I got excited when I saw the title. 4 stars simply because it's so similar to pipe dream. had it been a more original idea it would be 5 stars for sure.  very satisfied for a free app of the day.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Never very deep. Lots of first hand experiences and patriotic fervor. A good easy read without much mystery or deep thinking.
0316212261|5.0|it is a wonderfully funny story , very fast moving and it pulls u along for the ride. i will be reading her next story every shortly.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have a blast with this game,  it is fun and creative :) I let my little sisters play too and they even have fun with it :D
144234430X|5.0|Good Story, item was shipped quickly.  The audio was quality was great.  The person who recorded the book, was outstanding.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Surviving the trail while facing the past emotional pain provides the opportunity to bring closure to past events.  Her journey allows the reader to also manage through personal pain.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|No perks about this book. I feel like I am the only person on the planet that does not like this book but I just dont understand the love here. Defenitly not something I ever need to read again. The journal style writing did not bother me, it was just the whole premise and plot of the book. Unfortunately it was just bad, bad, bad.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Decided to get this book, being free and an old classic. Very good novel and well worth the price as well as the time taken to read it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is absolutely awesome, this is a game that I can say I'm glad I bought,this game will go far. Excellent graphics and smooth game play
B0001AP13A|1.0|Bought this album on vinyl and just like many others every song skips. Do not know if it is the retailers fault or just bad pressing when the album was originally made. Avoid buying the album from Hastings because I bought two copies of the record and both skip.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a different way to get to know what you just want in a different way that is not the only one thing I have been able to change the powers of the player.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A cute story, that was a quick read. Perfect for a day when you're relaxing!! Not too intense, just a cute story !
0441020712|4.0|Alastair Reynolds, as always, had a good storyline, plot and character development. However, it was not nearly as good as his Revelation Space novels.
B0083D9MXM|5.0|This Sony Stokowski issue is an Original Jacket Collection in disguise. I compared these recordings side by side with earlier releases and in all cases the new versions are richer, wider-ranged and more tangible, including the extra musical sounds from Glenn Gould and the Maestro himself in the Beethoven concerto. The impact of each is so alive that it makes me believe that these must have been re-mastered, even though there is no verifying information. Even if you, like me, are only adding one or two of these great recordings to fill in gaps in your Stokowski collection, the performances (in the case of the Ives 4th, the best ever), the sound, and the low price justify its purchase. You won't be sorry, unless you stay up all night listening.<br /><br />J. William Myers
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Shazam is so helpful to me! I barely ever know what the name of a song is is and this app helps me out so much! I used to have to look up the lyrics to a song, but not any more!
B0063M22QO|5.0|need more games like this<br /><br />Adults need stimulation rest and away to unwind and have their minds relax but stimulated to feel good
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a cool game and it is a fun game and I im the best At it fun credit a zzz y c oil
0553062182|5.0|I have always been sensitive to everything. It seemed that seemingly simple words or actions hurt me. It is hard for me to let things to that others barely remembr (it is still hard to let things go and not replay them a billion times in my head). Sudden noises are the worst. I can really see through people's real emotions and it bothers me. I startle extremely easy (it was cause for concern at one time). The list goes on and on. I bought this book when I was at a desperate place. For as long as I can remember my mother always accused me of being sensitive. And every time she said this to me, I would get super angry with her and cry when alone. It got to the point that I was sure I was a freak or something. Life was becoming unbarable for me. When I started the job I currently am at, I thought about quitting a short 2 weeks in. I could not handle the activity, certain peoples attitude, critism (which was just advise) etc, etc. Things were at an all time low for me. Then I googled information on being super sensitive (my moms words again) and came upon this book. It has been a life-saver for me. I actually cried when I read that no, I was not a weirdo, I was normal but just indeed sensitive and there was nothing actually wrong with me.<br />After reading this book I showed my mother and she learned some stuff also. My dad was always supportive and never thought I was odd (bless him). It has really helped the relationship I have with my mother. At one point I was really good (and think I am at a great place in my life now) so I donated the book. I decided to rebuy it and keep it so I can refer to sections when things are especially hard and I feel I cannot cope. Being highly intuitive and sensitive & living in a world of people are less so can be really really really tough at times. This book has helped me beyond belief and I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|m and my little brother love this game because it is so much more fun than temple run 1 because it has a zipline and you can collect gems
B0091VTISO|3.0|It was good when it started out, but more the movie progressed the less interested I became in the story.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|I WAS HOPING THIS WLOULD BE SOMETHING IT WASNT AND I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH IT AT ALL.  NOT WORTH IT.
B00B3HJLX6|4.0|Adrenalin Mob putting a spin on a few off the wall classics. For one, I really like Adrenalin Mob, so they cant really do no wrong. To be honest I may rank this at 3 1/2 stars if I could. Out of the hole, they jump right into Highwire, a song originally done by Badlands. A group I still frequently listen to, to this day. Right from the opening riff something caught me off guard. Cant quite put my finger on it, but aces to them for covering and recognizing this group and their work. I think I would have like to hear their live recording of this tune on here. I like what they did with Barracuda, Break On Through and The Lemon Song. True classic rock tunes with that Adrenaline Mob edge.<br />I guess what stops me from rating this better is the fact that they put The Mob Rules on here. Great cover of the song by the way, but I already have it from their first ep. Also, I love Ronnie James Dio and all his work he has done, but they basically cover three songs by him on here. Again, great covers, but would have like to here them put their spin on a couple more classic rock tunes, like the others on here. All in all, worth every penny I spent and will be kicking out these jams in my truck for a few.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Great. the Martin's do their best and succeed in improving the sound of the Beatles.  Up until this record I thought  the Beatles were perfect as they produce, with the technology of their time. I was wrong.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much, However there was a problem wiwth the streaming that caused it to stall at times. I finally had to just turn it off and try the next day.

B008WZHWCE|1.0|This is a terrible movie and a waste of good talent.  The story sucked and just plain boring.  A wate of time.
0385349947|5.0|You don't have to be angling for the corner office to benefit from Sheryl Sandberg's insightful analysis of both the internal barriers and the external realities that cause bright, capable women to hold back while men of varying capabilities charge ahead.<br /><br />I was especially glad that Sandberg spoke of her own experience with impostor syndrome... that nagging inner voice familiar to women and many men alike that say, \\"You've just been lucky\\" or \\"If I can do it anyone can\\" (I actually heard a woman say, \\"If I can get a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Cal Tech, anybody can.\\" Not.)<br /><br />Sandberg successfully weaves extensive research with the personal narrative of her own career journey and those of other women at all levels to explain, \\"the ambition gap\\" - an all too real phenomenon which stems from many sources to include self-doubt, the persistence of gender bias, and women's often more layered definition on success.<br /><br />The only place I see where Sandberg failed to connect the dots was when she talked about how \\"embarrassed and exposed\\" she felt upon being included in the Forbes list of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women list. She tells of repeatedly brushing off congratulations from fellow employees and asking friends who posted the link on Facebook to take it down. That is until she was taken to task by her executive assistant who told her she was handling the situation poorly by revealing her insecurity.<br /><br />I don't doubt that insecurity was in the mix. In fact, many readers will be relieved to hear Sandberg say that, \\"Even now, I'm a long way from mastering the art of feeling confident.\\"<br /><br />However, I believe there is another largely unconscious factor that drove Sandberg and a lot of other women to downplay our success, namely that success can separate us from others. This is true for some men as well, but more problematic for women for whom relationships are valued over power. This separation can manifest itself in multiple ways... the potential threat to a relationship that can arise from out-earning one's male partner, entering a field or job or being at an organizational level where few people (if any) people look like you, or the alienation from friends of family that can arise if you came from humble origins.<br /><br />On the whole though, Sandberg clearly GETS the complexities of female success. An understanding that is brilliantly woven through Sandberg's central compelling message: Far too many women hold back. We start smaller businesses. We raise our hand less often for plum assignments. We ask for less money than we deserve. We presume we know less than we really do. We over emphasize our weaknesses and downplay our strengths. And for a host of reasons not addressed in the book, women struggle more with the notion of acting more confident than we really feel (aka \\"fake it til you make it).<br /><br />As for the argument that few women will be able to relate to Sandberg because of her status and wealth, I say the fact that there are SO FEW women at her level, speaks to why her message is sorely needed. As far as I'm concerned, the chapter on the \\"Myth of Doing It All\\" puts to rest any claims that Sandberg doesn't get the difficult trade-offs all parents face, women in particular. Besides, would anyone fret about whether the masses would benefit from a book about success that was authored by a high powered man?<br /><br />I applaud someone of Sandberg's stature for shining a bright light on BOTH the institutional barriers and the needless self-doubt that prevents far too many capable women from realizing our full potential.<br /><br />Sandberg's message will undoubtedly inspire more women to stop asking permission to sit at the table - whatever that table means for you - and instead pull up a chair and lean the hell in.s... the potential threat to a relationship that can arise from out-earning one's male partner, entering a field or job or being at an organizational level where few people (if any) people look like you, or the alienation from friends of family that can arise if you came from humble origins.<br /><br />On the whole though, Sandberg clearly GETS the complexities of female success.

B0080CKGZE|1.0|Guess I'm gerring old.  Did not like the acting nor the story.  I have seen other movies similar to this one so it held no surprises or<br />my attention.  For anyone who appreciates a good story and good acting don't waste your time on this one,
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|The story line is about a mother looking for her son who is lost in these paintings. She must enter differn't paintings which take her to beautiful worlds. This game was easy enough so you don't have to push hint to know where to go next. The games were a little too easy but that was ok I kinda enjoyed that. I'm a 49 yr old woman so this game might not be exciting enough for young people but this is AWESOME for anyone who wants a relaxing BEAUTIFUL game.
B004YESKU0|5.0|This was a spectacular buy everything was a great shape and I love it, It's totally worth the money so buy it
B00942S4OY|5.0|OH HOW MUCH I LOVE ON DIRECTION AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET MY CD!!! WELL DONE BOYS I LOVE IT!!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love it.  When I get a chance to play games, this is my first choice.  It's fun and challenging.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|this was a great movie, easy purchase, loved that we didnt have to go out and rent it and no problem watching the movie on amazon prime.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I bought this for my grandchildren to play when they are here.  Can't seem to like it much.  Maybe I'm too old.
B00BHMEOP2|4.0|Downloaded Argo... didn't realize it was going to take HOURS to download before we could watch it!  Had to download and watch it the next day.  Argo is a good movie.  It is well done and interesting even when you know how it turns out.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Suspension of disbelief becomes impossible as more and more unlikely events are piled on.  Characters are the strongest element, plot the weakest.
0765365278|5.0|I love the way Brandon Sanderson writes!  His ability to transport the reader into another world, rich in color and character, is truly amazing.  In \\"The Way of Kings\\" we are introduced to the characters, and as with \\"Mistborn\\", questions about the significance of things, situations, and histories, and how these will all impact the plot.  I was immediately drawn in to this world.  I could not put the book down!  I am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.
1847940684|5.0|I've read this book 5 times all the way through and use it as a desk reference.  The principles in this book are timeless!
B001R55VWE|5.0|This film deals with the psychological consequences of being forced to choose between two bad choices. How does one act morally in a war zone-- when there are no moral option offered?<br />Cast is wonderful, direction is wonderful.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Beautiful graphics and music.  Perfect for the casual mystery gamer because you can choose your play level, which controls how much help you receive.  The game was fun and terribly addicting.  It was a little scary for one of my kids, but certainly not nearly as scary as TV.  I finished today and now am going to check out the next game.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Great movie.  Good for kids and adults.  Would highly recommend for anyone who is looking to have family night and wants to laugh out loud.
B000RFPORM|1.0|I couldn't make it through this crazy film.  The story did nothing for me and the special effects pale by comparison to today's stuff.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I haven't finished the game yet but I'm really enjoying it so far. The graphics are crisp and clear making it easy to find the hidden objects. I always have a great time playing Alawar games!
B00B23O96A|5.0|Every song is good. And with studio mates like J.J. Cale and Sir Paul, who could go wrong. Of course, the immediate highlight is ALL OF ME. If you like Clapton, even a little bit, it's time to get out the check book. Best EC album since Ocean Boulevard.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Has better sound than my 5.1 home theater surround sound setup (its over a decade old) which is a lot more than I'd ask for in a headset. Everything else is brilliant, comfortable, and its not ugly which is a plus. The wireless connection goes from my second floor through the basement and mostly works when I put nearly the entire house in its way. The microwave can interfere with the signal but other than that nothing is bad about it. Battery life doesnt seem like the full 9 hours it mentions but it lasts long enough to sit through a marathon Game of Thrones session. There are a few kinks that can cause the surround sound to stop working and the headphones to stop working in general. If you consider yourself competent with current technology then that shouldn't be a problem. Almost all the problems that arise can be fixed with a simple reboot of your computer if youre not that savvy. I'm sure audiophiles will have things to say about the extreme subtlety of the \\".1\\" aspect of this headset as well as the fact that the 'center' speaker seems to favor one side but honestly nobody listens to what those hipsters have to say anyway.
B000001FTH|5.0|Love it.  This is from the height of disco.  Dance and escape with Grace Jones.this is a classic.  You'll love it.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I had high expectations as this book has been heralded as an amazing read.  It did not disappoint.  It's one of those stories that touches your very soul so be warned, there will definitely be tears.  However, John Green writes with such a unique fresh voice that you never want it to end.  It's void of sentamentality but manages to grip you and take you on a journey you will never forget.  It's honest, profound and most of all a fantastic read.  If I could give it 6 stars I would!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome!<br />I loved the book.  I could hardly put it down.  It was so good I lost a lot of sleep<br />staying up late reading.  I highly recommend it.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I love the DVD's as I watch the series over and over, can't seem to get enough of Criminal Minds.  All of them work great together great and enjoy watching the &#34;team&#34; work together.  This is one show I never miss if I can help it at all.
B004H0M8EA|5.0|Jared Diamond brings us his compelling view of our lemming like rush to the edge in this analysis of societal collapse.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Too many times about his injuries and not nearly enough about heaven.<br />Could have spent a LOT more time talking about what he saw and heard.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|I was a bit leery at the low price since sometimes cheaper means too good to be true. But this was truly just a great deal! Seasons are individually priced for $35-45 at retail stores!<br /><br />I laughed at the one review from buyer who cautioned people in US to not purchase because it didn't work in her DVD player. Ummm blu-rays will NOT play in DVD players so don't let the &#34;import&#34; scare you.<br /><br />We seriously watched all the discs as fast as we could because this show is hilarious! It's our new fave and I know we will get a lot of used out of these watching over and over!
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|Listen to the samples and download your favorites.  It's a guarantee that you won't enjoy every song.  The mix of songs is decent at best and some don't warrant repeated listening.  Still worth checking out though.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Anyone who likes mysteries and adventure will get a kick out of this one.  Baldacci has always taken us on a great trip.
B00B935SUY|5.0|As a musician and sound engineering pro my self, I am happy this inspiring documentary is going out to the masses and hopefully more people would apreciate and respect the industry again.
B003FC3LQK|5.0|well done with cast and star preformers.  Setting was just as I imagined and the HD version was great.  Thanks
B005ETA5K2|5.0|This Wifi adapter works great on my macbook pro with Mountain Lion. A signal that was barely visible with the Airport is now at 90% signal strength. The device comes with a \\"double\\" Y USB cable in case your USB port does not give enough power, but I didn't have to use it. A simple USB to mini (or micro, I'm not sure...) works well with my mac.<br /><br />I had to install the updated drivers from Alfa's website. After that, it's plug and play. I was worried about the drivers, I saw many reports around the web about Alfa devices not working on macs. But this particular model works great with latest drivers.<br /><br />There aren't many wifi usb devices for mac, and even less with such power (2W). At this price it's a no brainer.<br /><br />Edit: After a few tests I'm very impressed by this device. I have been able to connect to a wifi spot 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) away in open space, and the signal strength was still about 60%... I presume it could double that distance in perfect conditions.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Great music!!!!!  Steve Wilson is so darn creative and he's so talented!  I think this CD is worth every penny
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Awesome game. Need to get it to play with friends. Awesome awesome game and wanted to start over get it now...go for it
B00A8307BG|5.0|WOW, some great guitar work on this one!  Love how he has re-done some of the greatest blues songs!!!! Buy it!
0446581356|5.0|I think every make up user should have this book! wether you rarely use make up or are a daily make up wearer this book has great info that every one can use!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It does not require a LOT of thought but keeps your mind sharp.  I enjoy it a lot.<br /><br />I would suggest it to others.
B009E3EY38|5.0|They sound great. They need to tour! They are tight as always, like they never stopped playing together. Plus Jason fits right in. Awesome!
B0063M22QO|4.0|It is not as challenging as some versions. It is entertaining and can be won due to the reshuffling feature.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|If you like Friends get this!  It has extra footage that i heard you don't get on the blueray version.
B000002J03|5.0|Awesome album, period.  Starts with &#34;A Whole Lotta Love&#34;, and if that don't get your blood pumping you might need to check and make sure you're still breathing!  One classic song after another.  Start to finish fabulousness.  Get the Led out!
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Not worth watching. .and not worth an Oscar award. I guess it shows how meaningful getting an Oscar awardis these days.
B000002KGT|5.0|This is Rumors.  Nuff said, really.  The classic, definitive album that set precedents and set radios across the country on fire in the late 70's.  Each song is a gem.  Essential Fleetwood Mac.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you want an easy read this is it. It's your predictable love story but an enjoyable read. I've never read anything of Colleen Hoover before, I'd consider reading another of her books.
0553801473|4.0|I have now read all 5 of the published books in this series.  I am waiting for the next book (though, from what I can surmise from my research, there will be 2 more books before this sage is completed).  I was disappointed with the lack of progress with the story line in this book...it just keeps going on and on.  But, since I am this far into the series, I have made a commitment for finish!
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Rod just seems to wrap his smooth style around these old numbers, which are a welcome antidote to 60 years of cacophanous Rock and Roll.<br />And I like the arrangements better than the standard orchestras on other new Old Standard productions, as much as I love some of the old arrangements.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I absolutely loved the Harry Potter series so thought I would give this book a try.  I never got into the book nor did I like the verbage that was used.I felt like a salmon swimming upstream.  It was such a &#34;downer&#34; to read that I absolutely struggled to get to the end.  Not an enjoyable read!
1609611543|1.0|I didnt like,these recipes as they used too many artificial substitutions. I do not like this diet  and don't consider it to be healthy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This terrific British series only gets better and more complicated in the second season.  Is there no one you can trust?
B0073PPNE8|5.0|A great film that offers something for everyone (a wartime love story). What a cast! Around every corner is another A-lister.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|You should be happy if you didn't understand this movie. It means that you've never had to survive an unimaginable loss. A loss that stays with you every moment of your life. For me, every moment was beautiful and heartbreaking. Be happy we live in a time where things like this can be created.
B007EECSFA|5.0|What a wonderful surprise when I found this author.  I love her characters and all their secrets. I couldn't wait to begin the next book by Kate Morton.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Great original story line, my daughter and I enjoyed this movie very much. It's was good to see some of the older games represented:)
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I enjoy this author's style of going from the present day to the past and back. The twists and turns kept me turning pages. The end was a total surprise.
B00AEFXI8W|5.0|Black Rain follows Nick (Michael Douglas) and Charlie (Andy Garcia), who arrest a member of the Yakuza. They are ordered to escort him back to Japan, where he escapes. Nick and Charlie team up with the reluctant Osaka police and delve deep into the criminal underworld. Black Rain is an all-round magnificent film, with beautiful cinematography and a stunning score.<br /><br />The story in this film is great; it follows a familiar story/character arc, but it's entertaining, nonetheless. It has action, drama, suspense, and it's occasionally funny- and it's all balanced very well. The story moves at a consistent pace and the storytelling is smooth; this combination manages to keep the audience interested and engaged. Michael Douglas' performance is great, as well as the rest of the cast. The cinematography in this film is amazing- it is a beautifully shot film, like much of Ridley Scott's filmography. The music in this film is outstanding, probably Hans Zimmer's most understated soundtrack. It's a film that can stand the test of time, it never felt outdated and can compete with the best of today, from a technical and story point of view.<br /><br />I own the Blu-ray version of the film. The picture quality is great, and the audio quality is good. In terms of picture and audio quality, it's not the best upgrade (\\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Taxi Driver\\" are examples of excellent upgrades) , but it's currently the best version of this film. The film is on a single disc, it has a few special features, including The Making Of, Commentary from Ridley Scott, and Previews.<br /><br />Overall, Black Rain is a beautifully shot, stunningly scored, and masterfully told film. It's as enjoyable today as it was yesterday or will be tomorrow. I HIGHLY recommend a purchase. Although the Blu-ray isn't perfect, it's the version to own, whether you're upgrading or purchasing for the first time.<br /><br />Black Rain has strong violence and blood.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I  love this author's style.  There are so many surprises. Her books never seem to end as I think they are going to.
1594135851|5.0|It's not really the kind of story that I'd go for... BUT I was literally captivated by the first volume, and this one did not disappoint me AT ALL. Thrilling story!!! I'm already Reading the third volume...
B000IDEQTK|1.0|I am soon losing access to Amazon prime a service I've had for the last 3 years. Funny I never bothered to watch movies on it before but now that I know I can't afford it and it will be taken from me in a few days I decided to give it a spin.<br />I saw this on the suggestions section and said I love Period Pieces. I even love Helen Hunt.<br />Yet I was un-amazed. The movie was going on at such a slow pace and I dozed off. I never even got all of the characters names. The location and costumes were great. ( I work in a costume department for Disney so I love when a period piece has great detail and is accurate for the era) The plot was uneventful and mostly unbelievable. You know a person whose always flirting with your wife and you keep him around?<br />If you are looking for something good to watch try the Scapegoat (2012). It's a foreign film, but has a stellar plot, exceptional costumes, and a happy ending.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I'm glad we still have soldiers dedicated to the cause of this country like Chris Kyle.  I'm just sad to hear of his tragic death.  His memories will live on.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|I like his movie. It's a little hippish and has a lot of action in it that keeps your attention....this is a classic in my collection.
B008VBYN80|5.0|can't stop playing. have to buy diamonds with cash if you are lazy, but you can earn them as well. exactly like clash of clans except for the battles.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG<br /> I could not put this book down!  This is the first book I have read by Colleen Hoover but I will definitely read more. Although they warned you about sexual content, I thought the love scenes were perfectly written. The part about their first kiss,OMG!<br />.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I really enjoy watching this show and the development of the relationship between Sherlock and Watson.  At first, I didn't know how I'd like a woman playing Watson, but it really works on this show.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Mr. Washington has proven his great acting skills a long ago.  This was one of his best performances in my view.  The story shows that people in all types of professions have problems.  In addition no one likes to admit it.  The film has no boring parts and it's characters are realistic. It is scary to even think about people that are responsible for our safety may have many flaws.  Mr. Washington plays a very complex man, and a wounded but likable woman plays his girlfriend, they have good chemistry.  This film is well worth seeing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The characters are so well developed and even though the Zombie killings are totally gruesome, I can't help but watch how they kill them.  They are so creative in the methods.  Can't wait from week to week in regard to what's going to happen next.  The tension between Rick and the Governor is really something to watch.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|it is not free but it is worth $0.99 I love app! Miniclip.com done great with this app. I use Miniclip.com as my game site alot
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season 3 of the Walking Dead has been great and excited for each episode. This 3 rd season is a must have.
0802473156|5.0|My friend recommended this book for me and my husband. We read it together and what a great relationship saver!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|watched this movie on the weekend while everyone was getting arrested from partying thank god for this movie.  it is pricey, but then again it is a classic and perfectly delivered. thanks again for this video
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My 10 yr old son and I enjoyed it.  He really liked the references to famous video game characters.<br /><br />Even the feel-good theme and &#34;positive message&#34; was tolerable - recommended.
B001F0TM5I|5.0|I saw this movie at the theatre with my friends and fell in love with it.  also check out planet terror and repo man, but the opera it has many great actors or for the most part noticeable ones
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is good but can be sketchy at times on my kindle. I would reccomend to little kids and adults.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|I enjoy this movie very much , the way it was put together base on true events , I can relate to it dialogo, it meet with the trail that  I review it. I enjoy review trail to see if it catches my attention of what it going to express.
B00B7IJBUY|3.0|...it's starting to get old. The anthems aren't the same, the country voice is taking over. I'll still buy it because I'm a fan of BJ and being from NJ, but doubt if I'll listen to it that much.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|This movie features Robert Redford and Mia Farrow and it was great seeing them in their younger days. The movie itself was pretty good, one thing that stuck out was how the characters were constantly made up to seem like they are sweating. That seemed  odd.<br /><br />Otherwise not a bad movie to watch, the story itself is timeliness and I enjoyed getting a refresher on it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm so glad I happened to read the Wall Street Journal the other day.  I started reading Wool because I wanted to somehow decipher Mr. Howey's formula for success and I found it.  What a great story and a rich world he has created.  I soon forgot why I had purchased the books and became lost in the story.  I was a Si Fi fan in my younger days and thanks to Mr. Howey I am once more.  I can't wait until the movie comes out too!<br /><br />I haven't been this impressed by a series since Dune.<br /><br />If you ever were a fan of Si Fi you will love it!  If you aren't read it anyway and you will be a convert!
B0010X758Q|5.0|Amazing album, every song is unique and leaves you playing tunes in your head over and over again. Highly recommended, you will not regret it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a really fun app. still like the first but yet different. I got it and I am still working on its chalinging levlea
0062014536|4.0|When I saw the sheer number of horrible reviews for this book I was terrified. I loved the first two books of the series and did not want to be disappointed. I was somewhat soothed when I discovered the source of the bad reviews: the unresolved nature of the love triangle at the heart of the story. Why? Because this book isn't Twilight. The love triangle is not the heart of the story. This series was never about the pull between Julian and Alex but rather about the nature of freedom and how we have to sacrifice certainty and security for that freedom. Is the Delirium series about love? Absolutely...but it's not necessarily about romantic love, or at least not all about romantic love. In the end we learn that Lena's life is complicated by the choices that she has the privilege to make...just like in real life. I am not sure when it was decided that the only good ending is a one with the loose ends all tied up in a pretty bow.<br /><br />This book, like its predecessors, is incredibly well written. The character development was well handled and did not feel forced. Lena made stumbled along the way and when we leave her she is still a work in progress...like we all are. No fairy tale here...and we should realize, as Hanna did, that a fairy tale ending is not always all it's cracked up to be.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I saw the Avengers first, used this movie to help explain it.  Better late than never.  this movie was worth watching and does well on its own.  Good story, not too far fetched.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I think this movie is a great movie for kids and has comedy and suspense tucked into it. Also I liked how it ended
B002DQLGHU|2.0|Bad quality image, I'd rather pay a little more for a better quality. I didn't even finish watching it. Hopefully some kind of improvement happens
B009B8YZIK|5.0|With my son overseas, its nice to ship him something with little hassle. He was very happy and enjoyed this with his friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It is a lot of fun and a great way to pass time for the kids
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Thought this was a good read mainly from the point of view that its premise was slightly different to books I'd been reading. Kept me interested enough to finish fairly quickly.
0316017930|5.0|This was my first Malcolm Gladwell book and generally I'm a slow reader (a chapter a day) but this book had me hooked.<br /><br />The book is a fascinating journey in trying to discover what sets a few people apart be it medicine, engineering or simply high school.<br />It tries and successfully breaks down conventional thinking of reasons behind success. I for one was even more convinced after reading the book that nurture dominates nature.<br />In the game of probability nurture wins hands down.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great story, great characters, very captivating.  Can't wait for the next episode, just wish that the season 2 episodes were available on netflix.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I love Phil Phillips and enjoy listening to this cd everyday. i am looking forward to his next one. Thank you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really addicting. I love it and the graphics are amazing, the horses seem real. I have a horse and I do a lot of the same things in the game that I do in reality.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was not as good as the first book.  Too much of the same as the first and in some areas became boring.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I could not wait to read it but I had to wait for my husband to finish. He read at every opportunity and I had to listen to his snorts of mirth. A delightful experience and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Could not put it down.
B0049VZ222|4.0|A very entertaining series despite my confusion of why don't the characters raid stores for more supplies such as food, weapons and ammo, and clothes? Also, if it were me, I'd dump the 1973 Wagoneer and drive a Range Rover or a Hummer! Haha!<br /><br />Love that it is filmed in Atlanta
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was a great read and really explained what our amazing troops go through every day in battle.  It is truly a shame how Chris Kyle left this world but he clearly made an impact while he was here.  A great american patriot he will always be and his family and all Americans should be proud for the sacrifices he made.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|This lens cap fits perfertly and did not add too much bulk to the camera.  This should have come wtih the camera from the factory, as the original one was a joke.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent series. All episodes have womething new to keep our interest at a high level. I love this series and can't wait for each new episode.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Easily one of my favorite movies of all time, since Netflix doesn't offer this year round I needed to purchase this myself.  Blu-Ray quality is amazing, as always.
0375703764|5.0|This book should be considered revolutionary, considering how much it should change your idea of how a book should be written and even more importantly read. The writing itself is magnificent, but beneath that is the subtext of another story that is equally compelling.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is how it captures our imagination by breaking the traditional boundaries of reading. The layout of the text forces us to read the book in a mirror way to what is happening in the book, it makes us part of the experience. That means it just doesn't tell you what's happening, you get to experience it. The words then mean more, the experience means more, and the book becomes not just a story, but an experience.<br /><br /> It wouldn't be easy to write this book even if you were given a guideline of how to write it. The risk the author took to define a paradigm that has never been explored before is amazing in itself and to do it so well is homage to equally amazing skill. The characters are so well defined and established and explored that you can fully empathize with their struggles and laments, their hopes and dreams. When they become afraid, you too become afraid. When they become lost, you too become lost.<br /><br />The entire book is about asking questions, it's about figuring out a mystery and it is something you experience and figure out with the characters. What matters, what's real, what is projection and everything in between is explored and explored like you've never seen before. Inherent in those questions is the exploration of finding an answer and those are the themes of this book.<br /><br />Beyond all of that, it is a love story. The question of love and the exploration of that theme and those elements is explored far more than anything else.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Epic Will Ferrell, great price, fast shipment.  I couldn't wait for this to come on TV so I just bought it myself.
B0036T1RMM|5.0|The beauty of this film is that it will never be made again. This is what happens when  Paul Thomas Anderson was given total control over a movie and a once in a life time chance to make a movie of this scope.<br /><br />The overwhelming powerful thing about this movie is that it is in intersection of several movies/story lines. The cop dealing with his job, the woman coping with being sexually abused, the nurse finding wisdom and companionship with a dying man, the disowned son reunited with his father, the genius child grown up and failing at life, the genius kid going through the trauma that breaks genius kids, so on and so on.<br /><br />There is no beginning or ending to any of those stories, we experience them all in the middle and so this movie is a collection of middles and intersections. The story becomes something worth more than the sum of it's parts, because in this intersection we see something of humanity and more about life. Life itself is a series of middles and connections and interactions, where often things remained unresolved and we avoid things, and are put on by things, and forced into things, etc.<br /><br />Normally such a high-scope projection couldn't work. But it did here and it did beautifully due to the magnificent acting of the characters and the amazing strength of the writing. It created powerful scenes, highly emotional and humanistic scenes of every gambit of emotion and every difficulty of life. That is what this movie was: Slice of Life, but taken to the most extreme expression.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This movie is perceived differently by many people. Some find it way too dreary and depressing. I heard some people stating that in the end it is uplifting and Christian in its message. I viewed it as somewhat of an existential masterpiece. I have to admit, I think the people that saw it as uplifting or Christian in its message watched a different movie than me. This is a story about a man that has been broken and sees very little to live for. However, when faced with a harsh and cruel alternative to living, the need for survival will change or at least alter that perspective. In the end, is there something out there guiding us or making sense of all of this, well, this movie answers that question in its own way.
0679720200|3.0|it is mostly just one idea fully explored. It doesn't have many of the more subtle nuances of Camus sardonic humor and philosophy, but is rather those things played out in one character and his reaction to life.
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|The Zodiac is one of those legendary stories that leaves you wanting to know more.  This movie was very entertaining and definitely worth every cent to rent it.
B0027Z837S|5.0|This movie is one of the best martial arts movies I have ever seen. The reason it is so exemplary is because of the inverted themes with the hero of the story. The protagonist isn't heroic or humble or kind or even competent, he's a street thief who's trying to get into the violent and ruthless axe gang.<br /><br />We find out that he tried to be a hero and wanted to be one as a child, spent his life savings on an ancient manual and attempted to defend a girl against bullies. He was beaten down and humiliated, everything he knew crushed, and then was show kindness by the person he was trying to protect, making him weaker than she was, in his mind. Rejecting his nature, he became what he previously hated, what he previously wanted to destroy.<br /><br />The main focus of the story is him, but also the town-village and how they all relate to the axe gang. The plot of this follows typical martial arts plots, paying favors to the martial arts cinema heroes of older martial arts films and the escalating and stylish battles there-in. All the fighting is beautiful and while it tends to be referenced to other works, it still completely owns them and makes them their own.<br /><br />It is in the final fight of the village and the axe gang that we see just who the protagonist truly is. It is in that powerful moment that this movie is something more than generic, something better than traditional, and something closer to magical. The way he changes, his final acts in that scenes, and the conclusion of the girl he tried to save so long ago and the fate he reject so long ago, end up in a cathartic moment rarely rivaled in any other cinema, let alone kung-fu movies.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This guy knows his stuff.  I've been lifting for 15 years.  I've read a lot.  I've learned a lot from experience.  MM gave me a lot of new knowledge and I've implemented it with great results.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson was put to a task that I don't envy: the burden of orchestrating a satisfying climax to decades of writing and thousands upon thousands of pages of characters, plot, and story. I have been a reader since book six came out and I was not disappointed to have to wait for a book like this to finish it.<br /><br />Just the fact that book wasn't disappointing is a tale in itself, considering the scope and the pressure. But not only was it not disappointing, it was astounding in its own right. Now, we can never know what the book would have been like with Robert Jordan at the helm, but we are told that Brandon Sanderson attempted to preserve all that Jordan did write about the end. Sanderson said he attempted to just write the transitions between the pages Jordan already recorded. I think this allowed us to get a story that was part Jordan and part Sanderson and worth more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to say I loved every bit of. I think some scenes were weakly written and some things went unresolved that I would've liked resolved. I felt some things finished up too tidily or too abruptly. I'm not going to say it was perfect, but it WAS satisfying. I was able to put the book down and feel like I authentically experienced the end of an era.<br /><br />I think if you've been a fan enough to read up to this book, you owe it to yourself to finish and you won't be disappointed to do so.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great rental.  I was surprised it was so cheap so early out of the gate.  I'll probably watch Dark Knight Rises again at some point.  The entire trilogy is amazing.  Here's hoping Chris Nolan will allow us one more glimpse of his greatness.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|This is a movie that took an incredible cast and director to make work. The payoff in this movie isn't in the conclusion, but rather the building up of the story and the experience there in. There isn't really a cathartic moment, the catharses is from the totality of the experience. The enjoyment is from the implicit reasons behind the actions and relationships of the characters. It isn't a movie that lays its heart bare, it is one you have to analyze to really understand.<br /><br />Such as the doppelganger relationship of Dodd and Quell and how they come to validate each others existence to the dismay of those around them. Understanding how Quell fundamentally changed, while staying the same under Dodds guidance. Then considering the question of if Quell was cured or not at the end. Then even considering if within the context of the movie, if Dodd's religion-like science was real or not (considering Quells dream). Then beyond all that, considering if Dodd is really making things up as he goes, if at the end he made up the answer to Quell's question of where they meant. The answer could go either way and signify Dodd as being authentic or cementing him as an manipulative egoist that really is making it up as he goes. I think you could argue either and be valid in either argument and it IS that which makes this movie so compelling.

B00881VLCE|2.0|The puzzles are beautiful. The different difficulty levels are nice too.... however, if you close the app or power down your kindle it does not open the app again. I have to remove the app from my device then re - add it from the cloud. Each time you do so you lose all the puzzles you downloaded before. I would love to purchase some of the puzzle packs I've seen in the paid sections, but will not be doing so as it would be a waste of money since I would have to keep buying the same puzzles over and over each day...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|He wrote this with heart and soul....A awesome individual that left us too soon! Have told everyone to read this!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Not much more than a high school paper. No development of any \\"buddies\\". No doubt he is (was) a bad boy that was on our side, thank goodness.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is very fun so far. The game is completely free and pretty fun. Pros: Graphics are good, it's free, and its a good time waster. Cons: imo I didn't like that the race was timed all the time, controls were very finicky, especially the tilt mechanic. Those are my only complaints, otherwise it was a very fun game. Get it and try.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This and the second season where the best movies ever. I was cheaper then buying it in the store or on the offical website. altogether i would recommend it to everyone.

1401938906|4.0|Do you want to blast your mind wide open but still remain practical? Are you finally ready to get out of your rut?<br /><br />Then this is the book for you.<br /><br />You'll even come away with some useful \\"tricks\\" to use in your everyday life for manifesting what you want.<br /><br />\\"Seeing with your own two eyes that you can change reality simply by observing it will rewire your brain and divest you from old conditioning. Learning, through scientific experimentation, how deeply you are connected to the field of potentiality will literally set you free.\\" ~ Pam Grout, E-Squared<br /><br />First, I'm already on-board with the concepts presented in this book. I've been practicing and living them for quite some time now.<br /><br />They really are valid and they really do work.<br /><br />But I was still attracted to this book because I was curious to see if there was something new here, and above all, I thought it would be fun to do some experiments.<br /><br />E-Squared did not disappoint.<br /><br />>>> Fresh Writing Style<br /><br />I loved Pam's writing style, it's so fun and easy to read. She's down-to-earth and quite funny. Besides being informative and revealing, E-Squared is entertaining and enjoyable.<br /><br />And for aspiring writers (oui, c'est moi), it's a superb example of using voice and analogy to get your point across. Very refreshing!<br /><br />It's also a great example of making concepts that could be merely theoretical into exercises you can apply in a useful way.<br /><br />>>> Energy and Consciousness<br /><br />A lot of the experiments (all simple, easy, and fun) work with energy and the Law of Attraction.<br /><br />But you also work with some underlying principles that are even more subtle, related to the Zero Point Field (of quantum physics) and consciousness itself.<br /><br />It's a nice mixture.<br /><br />\\"In fact, reality is nothing but waves of possibility that we have \\"observed\\" into form.\\"  ~ Pam Grout, E-Squared<br /><br />>>> Logic and Openness<br /><br />It's also a perfect balance of left-brained logic and right-brained openness.<br /><br />For each experiment, Pam offers a premise and the background facts are presented. You'll enjoy some great quotes and references, along with ideas for further reading.<br /><br />This is typically followed by some fascinating stories that are offered as anecdotal evidence, and to which you will definitely relate.<br /><br />She then lays out the experiment for you to perform complete with a lab sheet that summarizes it nicely and which you use to keep yourself on track and note your results.<br /><br />So fun!<br /><br />>>> Effectiveness and Validity<br /><br />I can't say that every experiment \\"worked\\" for me. And some I haven't taken the time to do fully yet.<br /><br />But a lot of them worked like a charm and it was fun watching them unfold into my life.<br /><br />I did notice, though, that even when I didn't get the results I wanted or expected, doing the experiment was revealing in some way and still worth my time. Usually, it was because I was not focused or consistent enough with it, or because my own energy was muddled in some way. Without the experiments, I wouldn't have understood that so clearly.<br /><br />\\"It's imperative to practice conscious, moment-by-moment awareness. Otherwise, you're operating out of old encrusted beliefs, beliefs you downloaded before you were five years old. Do you really want a five-year-old running your life?\\"  ~ Pam Grout, E-Squared<br /><br />So in every case I learned some good lessons to apply as I move forward.<br /><br />>>> E-Squared: Recommended!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this spirited book. Pam's natural sparkle uplifts throughout and makes the whole experience a positive one.<br /><br />I also think it would make a great gift for friends you might have who are \\"on the fence\\". ;-)<br /><br />If you play with these ideas and exercises like the author suggests, it will open your eyes to some newpossibilities -- especially if you're new to this, but even if you're not.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for review purposes, yet you can rest assured that this review reflects my honest evaluation.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|Shipment was timely, price was reasonable, quality definitely superb, was exactly what I wanted and is a very good value for the deal!
0525478817|5.0|I received this book for Christmas and was playing host for both of my book clubs in February.  I chose this book and had everyone in both groups read it.

0593051580|1.0|1421 is an intriguing adventure story, but readers should be aware that it's total fiction.  Much of what Menzies claims regarding Chinese sailing routes, celestial navigation, and mapping techniques are pure fabrication on his part.<br /><br />I would know because I'm a licensed skipper, experienced with celestial navigation, as well as a professor of geography and astronomy.  Though I'm not an expert in DNA tracing, plant/animal origins or archaeology, I suspect that his claims about his \\"facts\\" in these areas are equally specious.<br /><br />Buy the book if you like.  But be aware that it's fiction.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Sorry I cannot give a more detailed description of the book.  It was a light story even tho<br />the main charactor was running away from her husband.  I liked the new man in her life<br />and was interested on how she would handle a kind person.  I also found that the  ending<br />was getting rough but that contributed to the suspense.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Although I had read every one of his DI Rebus novels and both Fox novels, it never occurred to me to ask what would happen if Rebus were to cross Fox's path.  Luckily for us Ian Rankin is far more clever than me.  Rebus is as cantankerous and bull headed as ever.  Fox is every bit as stubborn, persistent and self righteous as Rebus but directing his energies to bringing him down.  The tension remains a storm gathering on the horizon of this cracking good novel; expect severe winds and lightening when it hits.  So, welcome back Rebus and, Ian, get busy!  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|There is no way the anticipation of a ten-year hiatus can ever amount to one's high expectations of a [David Bowie] record.  That being said, it is good to hear new Bowie and this record will bring smiles to your face and please you.  Has it really been that long?<br /><br />Ziggy Stardust was a long time ago, much longer than most of us have been alive.  It is a far cry from the likes of 70s Bowie, but it does harken back to his roots.  Not only does the album cover call homage to \\"Heroes\\", but so do the sounds.  You'll hear some up-beat tracks that make you wanna get up and dance!  Not just dance tracks, but tracks that make you reach out and rejoice with the other super-fans smiling ear to ear.  It's nice to hear Bowie stick to some of his roots and produce music that old fans will appreciate.  You'll hear traditional instruments, musical progressions... it's not \\"under produced\\" but it does veer away from the overly sharp and digitized noise of today.  This could very well be a \\"lost record\\" from Bowie hay-day.<br /><br />Will it blow you completely away?  Maybe.  Keep in mind that very few artists can come back from a hiatus and blow you away, it just doesn't happen.  But you will not be disappointed.

B00BHMETKC|3.0|I didn't care for the leftist political indoctrination (voice-over introduction to the Iranian revolution).  Likewise, the voice-over bit with Jimmy Carter just before the credits made no mention that the 52 embassy hostages were released on the day that Ronald Reagan became President -- Carter seems to take credit for their release.  Hardly.  The complete fiction of the airport scene (none of this ever happened -- the six &#34;Argonauts&#34; simply boarded the airliner without threat, delay or further incident) is an insult to history that was added by the film-makers for dramatic effect.  Puh-leeze.  This story could have been told honestly, with better drama centered on the reality of the situation in Iran, with better acting and more intelligent dialog.  Instead, we get a puerile political lecture, thinly-drawn characters and fictional chase scene (cars vs. a Swissair 747).  Academy award for best film?  Really?

B00AFROVQC|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, the characters, the plot, the setting.  Sucked me in enough, that I really needed the next book as soon as I was finished.
B008133MDK|5.0|Makes all other Sherlock Holmes production look second rate. Writing and production quality unmatched by any current TV or movie version.
B009BJAPLK|2.0|The premise was cool and the opening sequence had me hopeful. The pilot turned out to be extremely boring an predictable. I hope it gets better but I wont be finding out.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|ME AND MY WIFE LOVE WATCHING THIS TOGETHER AND WE ARE READY TO SEE SEASON 3. VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRICE

B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|How can anything David Bowie releases be just O.K.? Well, this one is better than what was O.K for a long while. Being a die-hard fan myself right from the early 70's, I regrettably find that David Bowie cares little about tweaking his songs to perfection; perfecting his vocals in the studio, crafting definitive songs into radio hits. And yet, somehow, he's always managed to eek out classic-sounding songs, if not anything in the Top 40! It seems with this release, having long-time friend & legendary producer Tony Visconti reunited at the helm (who also reunited with Bowie on 'Heathen'), that Bowie & Visconti have made a contemporary 'rock' album full of old Bowie tricks & treats, some really potent & distinct.  In fact this collection is chuck-full of potentially great songs which have some of Bowie's most powerful vocals of the latter part of the legend's career. As we all know, David Bowie is a first-rate vocalist, one who can sing along with any of the greats right down to Bing Crosby! Here, Bowie is pulling out all the stops, sometimes singing full-blast, at the top of his range, atop song patterns which are some of his better efforts since the early 90's .  Furthurmore, the upside to this collection is that David Bowie is in the studio with lots of new original songs, some of which are epic in their reach & scope. Visconti is right by his friend's side, joyful with his boss' exuberant new material. However, for me, David Bowie has become such a dark songwriter, a social malcontent, an elder statesman watching from his upper suite in lower Manhattan, bitching about everything. However, the once peripherally popular & flamboyant musician/singer who seemed to always have his audience admire him as the most unique hybrid of pop, rock, R&B performers, with even a peppering of No.1's here & abroad, sadly has positioned himself more like a Phil Ochs or Bob Dylan. Here, the bohemian elder statesman sings of dark & dejected social discontent. This is to be expected withage & status.  This release is brimming with a cacophony of alternative, computerized, metal-ish old-school rock, a well made studio effort, full of trimmings & subtle production finishes. The technology to recent Bowie albums, particularly since 'Earthling' ( a good LP), has a mish-mosh of studio electronics & old-fashion analogue rock; Bowie desperately trying to retain his hybrid status as a 'plastic' modern musician. Don't be fooled however, none of this sounds like anything on the charts, & therefore may not be of any interest to the young & only a few of the old die-hards more familiar with Bowie's more dense & dark releases. What's the point of even trying for any chart action at 68? No chance for a 'Hunky Dory' II, God forbid a 'Let's Dance' anywhere to be found.  A slow song like 'Where Are We Now' is so beautifully subtle in its sparse arrangements; Bowie's vocal feeling deceptively half present on the track. It's a lovely tune, one of his best, but all too brief. Bowie does pick up the pace with some desperate over-the-top songs like 'Set The World On Fire, & the angry 'Boss Of Me', to the far-reaching, 'You Feel So Lonely You Could Die'. On the latter track there's a feeling of a 'swan song' in the air. On the other hand, when he lightens up on a track like 'Valentine's Day', the song feeling a bit dated in its overall style, it does have a vocal performance quite engaging & almost 'Ziggy-like'.  The single, 'The Stars Are Out Tonight', has Bowie muttering a terrific lyric, showing new nuances as rock's premiere vocalist. You know that he could sing the hell out of all these songs. And depending on the song, he does! The best Bowie performances feature vocals which are perfectly phrased & sung with great nuance & abilities, such as his vocal on 'Set The World On Fire'.  On 'The Next Day' Bowie's vocal decisions are schizophrenic and commanding all at once. His voice is still in fine shape. He just doesn't want to sound like Anthony Newley ever again! Sowe get the title track which, in my opinion is the worst of the bunch; no melody, no singing, no nothing, & others so supreme in their nuance & overall execution. Bowie can do whatever he wants at this stage of the game. Here, he most certainly does. He's the master!  My other favorite track, besides 'Where Are We Now', is the tossed-off bonus ditty , 'So She'. Here, Bowie is breezy & lite with a perfect vocal delivery.  Where is David Bowie? What does he want us to know? Will this LP, a comeback for some, put David Bowie in the bigger social consciousness of music again? I think not. However, for those who are really listening, this is a monster attempt to reconnect with David Bowie, the singer/songwriter. Even if he stopped here, & not with 'Blackstar', we'd still have one of the very best from one of the very greats. Sadly, what was 'Next' was the last...
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Celtic music is always inspiring and heart warming.  They really have a God-given talent to sing and do it in such a way that you feel they are right there in the room with you.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Our daughter gave us season 1 for Christmas.  We really enjoyed the series so we purchased season 2. Can't wait for season 3 to go on sale. Definitely an adult series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's hard to make me cry reading a book, but this book did. It was raw and emotional. I loved the bookand will be one of my favorite books. It's makes you feel new and refreshed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very nice graphics :-)<br />And pretty realistic wife loves it she has three horses of her own but takes care of 4 more a well for others
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to see Argo available on Amazon. We watched it and enjoyed thr movie very much. In fact we gave it 5 stars.Of course the movie itself rated 5 stars Best Picture Academy Award. Its presentation on Amazon also would be worthy of 5 stars. No interruptions, good sound, good picture quality all made the viewing very good. We loved it. Thanks for offering it so soon!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Supposedly to view media, I downladed this. Some video are still unavailable and kindle has a viewer app already. So it does do anything.
B000OSC3GM|3.0|Turn back the clock and sharpen the contrast. Modern eyes have to work a little harder.Still, it takes me back.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Lets face it the Stallone version sucked, hard. This reboot is amazing, it's a shame it didn't get more interest because it is a great movie. Good writing, acting and character development, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fast paced action movie, or a film buff who enjoys good comic book adaptations.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|this streams my HTC EVO 3D phone to my ps3, main reason I downloaded it. but I couldn't get it to stream the phones apps to the tv, had to select though the ps3 to stream my pics, videos and music
B00B2V66VS|1.0|game locks up and you can't get past imangi screen. only way to get the game back is to uninstall and reinstall. you then lose your achievements and everything else you earned. good game but not worth the hassle. DISAPPOINTING!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love these batman movies, there great and they all just come in one package. plus small cool art book
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|it started out well, but it stalled shortly after it began. was able to play for a while, but once you open the safe in the office it will not let you advance. not worth the install. thankfully,  the app was free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is an amazing game for those of you who would like to learn about taking care of horses.I also recommend this for anyone who would like a horse but is not allowed
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it! This is a really cool game and I love horses. I like feeding them and taking care of them and train them.
B00BHMF578|5.0|both my husband and I loved this movie! it was very exciting, and easy to follow, would recommend it to everyone!
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|This movie was very disappointing.  Granted, it had plenty of action and I understood the overall plot.  However, it was many times very confusing.  I have seen every Bond movie and sometimes found scenes I did not understand.  However, this one was so full of them that I was left scratching my head so much of the time.  I hate to say I cannot recommend this Bond movie, as I am an ardent Bond fan.
0375851569|4.0|It's a Dr. Seuss book collection. It's exactly what I expected; new granddaughter, and I'm working on getting all the Dr. Seuss books for her collection. It is nice to find a collection of books, priced more competitively than ordering them all individually.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|The second I started this game it was a little hard but after a few minutes with the game I got use to it and I can't stop playing. the game beach buggy blits is fun so what are you waiting for. Go ahead and buy it<br />Callie
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of my favorite games.  It's full of intrigue as the levels go on and gets harder and harder as you reach different levels.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is a fabulous album..I mean CD..the music is rich and mellow.  The story alone behind the success of this album is worth the purchase.  You won't be dissappointed.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Excellent read.  It was a little on the predictable side but who cares.  It was a very enjoyable book and I would highly recommend it.
B00004YRQA|3.0|works as expected. What more do I need to say? Oh for crying out loud... this is getting silly. Seriously?
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was my first Kate Morton book, I finished it and immediately bought another one!  This book was great.  The seperations of the classes is interesting, not something we are used to anymore.  The dynamic between the sisters and the maids, the loyalty....  Makes for a great read.  It was really great, hard to put down.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Knowing that this was based on a true event made it even more intense.  Found myself sitting on the edge of the seat most of the movie.  Should defintely check this one out.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|This was my second Kate Morton book and I can't decide which one I like better.  This really was a great book.  I loved the characters, especially the sisters.  I have to say that several times I thought I had it all figured out with this book and the next thing I knew I was re-thinking everything I thought I had figured out.  I love that about Kate Morton's books.  Plus they are nice long books, so you feel like you are getting your money's worth!  I definelty recommend it!!
B004XQYBA2|3.0|There are many sites to print free ones but this on you can take along.  Not sure how to reset individual puzzles yet so I guess it was worth the price
B004UJAOLM|1.0|When I read a summary of the story and viewed the DVD, I did not want to read the novel. It was far too depressing to see again or to read. I'm sure Emily Bronte was a great author, but no character came out happy in that story--too dark and depressing.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|for those young viewers that didn't see the first total recall I guess this is ok but please see the first one with arnold schrazeger(spelled wrong) because it is truly the best. This one wasnt bad either just not the same. I like the female actress and clin farrell is pretty cool.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|great book, cant wait to see the movie!!! everyone should read, i dont even like to read and this kept my attention!!!
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|zombies, killer moves, team work, characters from the game. I love resident evil. Maybe this movie sucked if you didnt follow it or play the games but it was nostalgic to see this bad ass chick kick some zombie ass.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck is great in this movie. Even if it's inspired from a real story, the suspens is still here until the end. Great !
B00BHMF578|4.0|I didn't think making movie about a controversial subject like this could be suspensful. I enjoyed it. Ben afleck can act.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a zombie movie or tv show addict per-say. Actually I have never liked one zombie movie I have watched! Until my hubby said hey watch Walking Dead with me! I heard: Hey come watch Norman Reedus! But I have to admit I am as anxious for Sunday night to get as the rest of the family now!
B001XUKFAQ|5.0|Wow, Tom cruise dancing, robert downey jr as a black guy, and jack black! What else can you ask for. this movie was fantstic! Hilarious.
B0037QGS0K|5.0|I came at this film knowing nothing about it except what I read on the back jacket and that it included the incredible actress Amanda Seyfried (pronounced Zi- freed). Man, what a ride. Seyfried plays a quirky prostitute that really aims to please.  That pleasing is focused on the seemingly dejected wife of Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore. Rarely do you see a film that can capture eroticism with such accuracy. The film is art in motion. The trio of Seyfried, Mooore and Neeson portray real people with believable emotions and desires that raise raw sexuality to true everyday existence. The couples teenage son also adds a fresh approach to intimate encounters.<br /><br />The term \\"erotic thriller\\"  really hits the mark as Seyfried walks a tightrope that envelopes you with thrills and chills. Her body is made for the cinema. Liam Neeson does not typically play the confused husband role but handles in deftly while Moore reveals the amazing range of her acting abilities. Not to be missed on a cozy night home with a lady friend.
B00BLGY8X2|1.0|I had no clue what this movie was about. It was so strange and made no sense what so ever. I seriously think the director was on some drugs because I have no idea what this was about.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I was hoping for a memorable cd after quite a dry spell. This is not what I had hoped for. All the tracks sounded alike. A waste of a fabulous voice
B000FC13Y0|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I wish there had been a little more action. Especially at the end of the story. It seemed to long for a grander conclusion. But all in all a good read.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Easy listening with a fabulous voice. Loved the back up orchestra. Wonderful for an evening at home by the fire!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There are many annoying things about the fifty shades novels, repetition being one of the worst, description of anatomy such as &#34;he touches me....there&#34;, gets on my nerves. But overall, some exciting reading, great plot, great characters etc....

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I found myself in a motel room with a clock that didn't work, which wasn't acceptable.  I went to the app store and found this item so I'd be able to tell time when it was dark and be able to have an alarm.  I like this app.
B004OR199G|5.0|Great information. Super funny and easy to read. Couldn't put this book down. I have been vegan for over a year, and still learned a ton of new info.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have all my textbooks as ebooks and I have had nothing but problems. Since the semester started a bit ago I have had to delete and reinstall kindle EIGHT times. I am seriously regretting depending on kindle in the future. It is not worth the effort. It will work fine for a few days and then just crash. It might let you go to the menu but normally onces it has crashed I have to do a hard restart. And somedays I won't have a textbook for a day or two and have not been able to study or do homework.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|He has simple yet great fundamentals ...no quick fixes... real hard work for real results.  I like the link to the worksheets too..printed those out and they make a difference!
B009J2VQSK|4.0|Love this soundtrack. It's on every time I'm feeling creative in the kitchen, now. I love the variety and the original songs are great.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I do check in and play this game every day.  However, since I am NEVER going to spend money to play it, it's frustrating that you can only play for a few minutes a day.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I don't really get the point. You walk around and collect signs that appear to be randomly tossed about the environment while trying to avoid some guy that just keeps appearing in different locations. There is no real strategy to it that I could see.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Book is a two edge sword, it has the power to change any body.  it's the Book of Books.  Greatest ever!!!

B00881VLCE|5.0|Lots of free puzzles to download. Nice pictures. Can select number of pieces and whether to have them rotate. Fun puzzle game.
B00005ATQF|5.0|This movie was a repurchase for me to add to my DVD collection. I love the filthy things that R. Lee Ermey says. Its utterly entertaining and worth the price of this movie alone. Classic. This isnt your typical war movie.
B009OWGMYI|5.0|MOST of HIM's greatest hits are on this album. One of the hits that is not on here is &#34;RazerBlade Kiss&#34;. I'm sure there are other hits that are missing, but I've been a HIM's fan for a few years now; so, I'm still learning.<br /><br />All of the music is good. I have so many favorites: &#34;Join Me&#34;, &#34;The Sacrament&#34;, &#34;Wicked Game&#34;, &#34;Killing Lonliness&#34;, and &#34;Heartache Every Moment&#34; just to name a few.<br /><br />Anyone that is a HIM fan or wants get their best songs without having to purchase a lot of albums should get this. Not to mention it's only $5! This album is worth more than that, so you're getting a great deal. Albums a LOT crappier cost more than this. Believe me, it's worth the money.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was expecting the love story considering it is a Nicholas Sparks book, but the story of the abusive relationship was a bit of a surprise.  Sparks really delved into the psychological aspect of a battered woman and her abuser.  The suspense kept me reading way past my bedtime. This book was recommended to me by several people, and they were right. It was a captivating read.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I can watch this movie fairly regularly.  I like how it shows that the prince doesn't fall for stupid women.  That he falls for the intelligent girl despite her background.  That Cinderella, doesn't cave to stupidity to get her a man.
B000I3W1XS|5.0|This movie is best watched directly after Space Seed and Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan.  Growing up, I always loved Star Trek II and IV, but always felt like this was the \\"boring\\" one of this particular story arc.  I only watched it again a couple of times, unlike watching Star Trek IV to the point of line memorization, lol.  However, now that I am older and have been married for 7 years, have gone to college, have purchased a house, have suffered the loss of my father, I know so much about what it is to truly live and how the people in your life are such a HUGE part of that.  In Star Trek III, we get to see the relationships between the characters like never before.  Part of the reason we really get a feel for the connection between the crew members is because they have acted together for so long, but it is also because the writing and directing of this film is superb.  You really get a good sense of the DEEP and loving relationship between Bones, Jim, and Spock--especially between Jim and Spock.  They are, for all intents and purposes, like a married couple (but not in a sexual sense.)  The moment when Spock has his catra back and turns around and looks at Jim after walking by--it is a heart stopping moment.  The love between the two is so great and so heartfelt in just a little exchange between Jim and Spock.  Watching this directly before watching IV is a must for truly appreciating IV in even more and greater ways.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Watched this pretty much on the basis of seeing the five star rating. It's a great uplifting movie. Subtitles were not even a drawback.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|This movie is best viewed directly after watching, in sequence, Space Seed, Star Trek 2, and Star Trek 3.  This is the best of the Star Trek films.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book rang true for me. I have somehow already known what he wrote about. I have just always felt it in my gut what was really there afterwards for us. What he wrote reaffirmed my beliefs.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This'll be a quick review for those who don't want to read a twelve page in-depth expose; for those who do, just scroll around a bit.<br /><br />This is an absolutely solid mouse. It's slightly larger than my previous mice; I find I'm still able to claw grip it, although it's far more comfortable to palm grip this mouse. All the buttons (to my surprise) are excellently placed and easily distinguishable by touch, not to mention a cinch to program. Adjustable weight is always a nice touch as well.<br /><br />Basically, if you want a great mouse for a good price, you've found it. Short of having a keypad on the side, this mouse offers options to satisfy even a hardcore gamer: multiple profile setups, on-board memory, adjustable polling rate (up to 1000hz) and DPI (8000 DPI is no joke), aesthetically attractive, and ergonomically designed.<br /><br />At $40, this is the best mouse your money can buy.
B001223BLU|5.0|This album contains some of my favorite songs.  All of them are very familiar and bring back good memories of listening to them on the radio.  Very good sound quality and song selection.  Highly recommend.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|I'm a big Tarantino fan and the Kill Bill movies are among my favorites. I can watch them over and over.
B009O2XY12|4.0|The only negative is running out of energy and having to wait a while. I would pay for an unlimited game.
B00130UFY2|5.0|This was the best bourne out of all of them. The handheld camera witch most people complain about did not bother me. The bourne triology in my opinion is the best movie series.

1451695195|5.0|Why do I give the heading \\"debunking the debunkers?\\" Simply becuase any time there is a discussion or book about the near death experience or other metaphysical phenomena, the knee jerk reaction of the so called skeptics is to totally deny and debunk the possibility of such a phenomena, a la James Randi. The debunkers always come up with a contrived explanation for the perceived NDE experience. Dr. Alexander is an accomplished surgeon and scientist. Thus he is able to scientifically explain that the rationales and alternative theories of the debunkers, which he adresses himself to, are not at all scientifically valid and are just so much nonsense.<br />  Lending crediblity to the book is that the author is NOT a religious zealot, out to foist onto the reader his own quaint belief system. The author himself is quick to admit that before his own NDE, he was a deep skeptic about the matter.<br />  To one who is well read on NDEs, is this just one more book? Yes and no. The patterns of the experience are little different from other books and little new ground is broken. What is different are the unassailable scientific credentials of the author. Thus this book perhaps takes the subject of NDEs out of the fantasy realm and more into the area of very real but very unexplainable phenomena.
B00B01XDTI|4.0|Its a great movie but with the first Silent Hill it just leaves more to the imagination. It seems like there should of been more to the story
0802473156|5.0|This is a book I wish ALL COUPLES/ individuals read BEFORE getting married!! Simply amazing!! You must understand your love language as a person in a relationship. Even as years pass by, your love language changes/ develops over time. I MUST READ!! Amazing!!

B001ECE6D0|4.0|I got this CD just to get a feel for the band, I have heard alot of their songs on youtube or pandora but never got around to buying an album.  I figured Id start with the best of to get a good taste of the band.  Overall its a very good cd, I bought the 2 cd set that totals 40 songs.  If has the typical \\"maybe tomorrow\\" and \\"dakota\\" and alot of great other songs on it that are new to me, \\"more life in a tramps vest\\"  and the \\"bartender and the theif\\"<br /><br />I would recommend this to a long time fan or someone who wants a good sampling of a great band!  ENJOY
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I would not consider myself a fast reader, but I read this cover to cover in about 8 hours. This book is highly engaging and keeps you turning pages. I enjoyed reading Fight Club, then next read Survivor: A Novel. Currently, I am paging through Choke: A Novel. I highly recommend his work, and if you enjoy Fight Club, keep reading more of the author's work.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I did not watch Downton Abbey until January of this year (not sure why). I've watched all three season in just a few weeks and I am ready for season 4 to start. I have watched a couple of the episodes from season 3 more than once!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|It seemed a bit jointed and had random stories that were never completed. Like the Canadian all of sudden popping up and leaving with no other references.  I found the second part of season 2 enjoyable, the best ending EVER. That was so satisfying.
B00BHMF578|3.0|this movie is over-hyped in the media.  I don't think it deserved the oscars for best movie. I expected more.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Great album-lots of good songs.  I remember when Train hit with &#34;Drops of Jupiter&#34; and while I liked the song, I wasn't sure if they would be a long lasting group.  All these years later, I think I can consider myself a Train Fan and this album is a great addition to my music collection.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|this game lags frequently. the time counter doesn't work when kindle idles so it stinks that i have to keep the games active to hey my food and coins to add up.also now it wont even open for last 24hrs on my kindle. I have restartes my kindle multiple times to no difference.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Lots of twists and turns..whole bunch of characters to try to keep track of.....  inter- agency's and governmental turf wars makes it complex
B001NLKWLW|4.0|An entertaining and fast read despite it's great length. It could have been edited quite a bit, but overall I wasn't disappointed I had to read this for a book club. It isn't a deep novel, but it's a good story.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I give this 4 of 5 and I'm being harsh in this but please don't miss understand me, the movie works great all the parts work fine and the ponflit was still with it, However, (and this is what gave it a 4 instead of 5) the casing for the movie had a paper covering that wasn't very presentable.<br />I take care of my movies and like to show them off and this one didn't seem to be well taken care of. It wasn't ripped or skrached but kinds just falling off the plastic cover that it was protecting.<br />Other than that I am Very pleased with my purchuse.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I guess i've read better porn. I read the first few chapters and never went back. Maybe I will pick it back up later.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|The movie works great but the casing it was held in was dameged. It looked like someone poked their finger in the back side of it. Other than 'the look' of the case I am very pleased with the purchuse.
B00B9366VO|5.0|A great story that centers around the Neve console that was used to produce some of the best rock albums of all time.  Having worked in the industry and visited Sound City several times during its heyday, this movie brings back some great memories.  Grohl also includes so many of the musicians, producers and technicians that worked at the studio to help tell the story of how the music was made and what a special place Sound City was.  Any music fan will love this.
1616550414|5.0|Awesome build quality, high definition rare pictures, great zelda's productors and creators sketches and doodles, hidden informations of the games and an amazing storyline envolving all zelda games.<br />If you like zelda, nintendo, modeling, drawing and making offs, this certainly is for you.
B008645YH6|5.0|It was a brand new CD and it arrived right on time, what more can I say? I've been wanting this CD for a long time and had a hard time buying this album for another seller. Today I finally got it and that made my day. I downloaded the songs to my MP3 and they sound amazing. I am very happy.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Pros: I really cannot say because I have not used it. The way my motherboard oriented the socket, makes the heat sink take up 2 of my RAM slots.<br /><br />Cons: My only complaint is since it is so big, why not make a better way of mounting the heat sink over CPU. The little arms that bolt down the heat sink to the CPU is a bit clunky and does not allow you the freedom of adjusting how the heat sink will sit on the CPU. For example: Most mother boards will have a north/south orientation for the socket. That is how they designed the arms to fit on. My CPU socket sits east/west. It is terrible that I cannot use this device because of the armatures that fasten the the unit to the mobo is only flexible to socket types, not socket orientation.
B003L77FYS|4.0|Really entertaining with the family and Beckett things going on. Every show has been very entertaining with really unique story lines
B0043VDIAG|4.0|A little bit predictable but did really enjoy this light thriller/romance.<br />Recommended read for a mid-summer romantic but don't forget to have tissues handy.
B0053O89KG|5.0|The ending show of this season is pretty moving with the graduation and Beckett breakup with Castle while Andrew Belle&#34;s In my Veins plays in the background
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an excellent,thrilling,adventurous game that I would love to share with others. I think the game is super.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Nathan Fillion is something else and does a great job as Castle. Each show leaves you wanting to see more and more
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great. keeps me well informed. best weather app on the market. this is one app I couldn't live without.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|To me this was the best of the series since it lays the groundwork of what is to come. The mixture of family moments and the interaction of the cast is really refreshing
B000RO9VJK|4.0|The idea of &#34;turn-key&#34; business is valuable. Think about your business as if you are going to sell it, so make it work as a self-sustaining mechanism from which you can withdraw at any moment without affecting its operations and effectiveness. Also, clearly stating your life goals and how you plan to reach them can help a lot. Many good ideas in this book, but I didn't like the dialogues with Sarah, the hypothetical business owner. They are easy to skip though, since they are always at the end of each chapter.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I had nearly given up my quest to find a watch with both an analog chronograph, and the ability to show a second time zone.  Every other watch I could find did one or the other.  My wife found this watch and bought it for me for a birthday present, and it was a total surprise.  I love this watch - it fits well on my wrist, is just the right weight (you feel it, but it's not super heavy), the movement is very precise, and it looks great.<br /><br />I'm not going to fool myself into believing that the circular slide rule aspects are going to be incredibly useful in flight, though if I can manage to remember how to do the distance/time/fuel calculations, then it might be easier to use the watch for a quick &#34;ball park&#34; figure during flight.<br /><br />Most of all, it's very good looking.  I buy watches as fashion items, as well as functionality.  This one does both quite well.
B005USZYDU|4.0|This book is really exciting and makes you think for a little bit. I recommend this to law-loving people. This book is excellent!
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I have been waiting for this release since I first heard of it being recorded as \\"The Rachmaninov Project\\" on Valentina Lisitsa's youtube site.  The story goes kind of like this: Valentina Lisitsa was born in Kiev,Ukraine and by many accounts wanted to be a World Class Chess Player. She fell in love and later married Alexei Kuznetsoff who attended the same music school for gifted children.  He was a pianist and so her intrest concentrated on that direction.  They performed at competitions together wining 1st prize for two piano playing at a competition in I believe Miami Florida and moved to the United States shortly afterwards. Lisitsa refers to herself as an American pianist and was never a performer in the \\"Russian Style\\", an observation leveled on Rachmaninov himself throughout his performing carrer.<br /><br />Lisitsa started recording Youtube videos in 2007 and gained a gianormus fanbase.  In 2010, she and her husband sank everything they had to record this album with the LSO.  She continued her youtube recordings and some CD and DVD recordings of limited distrubution on their own.  Finally, in the spring of 2012, she signed with Decca Records and the release of \\"The Rachmaninov Project\\" became a reality!<br /><br />These recordings amaze me. I expected Lisitsa to be electrifying in her playing, honest in her interpretation, perfect in her diction, and refreshing in the details. After all, she does that time after time in her previous recordings regardless of the venue.  What I did not expect was for the London Symphony Orchestra and Michael Francis to be drawn into the same inspiration that her fanbase has been enjoying all along.  But inspired they are and it is music together that they make!<br /><br />Worth the wait? You Bettcha!  This is a great price for a two CD set so try it for yourself!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found this book to be one of the best I have read in terms of sci-fi in a long time. I haven't seen the movie, if it is anything like the book I will enjoy it. Ms Collins did a wonderful job!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Fast pacing,excellent dialog, and effortless acting make this a great film. Thrilling even though we know the historical outcome. Bravo!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Watched in marathon fashion on a snowy winter Saturday, highly recommended upon completion of season one.  Snow not required for enjoyment.
B008US4PBY|5.0|I have had this since last july I believe and it works flawlessly.  I bought it so I could use my 360 controller on my PS3 and also on my computer with the ability to map the buttons. I have never tried to use a wii controller or a PS3 controller on the 360 but I imagine it works just as well(as long as you have a wired 360 controller. I still love it when I am playing my PS3 and it is a game like uncharted that is only on PS3 and my friend's see me holding a 360 controller.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This movie is a great 007 story and has lots of good action.  It is a little different but it certainly didn't disappoint me.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|I was truly gitty about getting this movie when it came out in 3D. I think I've probably averaged one Top Gun screening a year since it came out. It's just one of those guy movies.<br /><br />I have a 3D TV etc and was excited to get this DVD in 3D. The 3d is average at best. I guess it's probably hard to redo an 1980s film in 3D especially since it was all shot with real footage and not computer animations. But they did a good job with it in my opinion, just the overall end result was less than impressive.<br /><br />Still an EXCELLENT movie, but I guess I'm reviewing the 3D when I give it 4/5 stars. It just wasn't as mind blowing awesome as I expected. The movie itself is still a 5 star movie.
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the better James Bond movies. The whole family loved it. I would recommend this movie for all to see!
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this app.  However, I would give it 5 stars if it didn't delete all my downloaded videos when I upgraded to the latest version.
1609611543|5.0|My doctor told me about this book so I decided to order it and I sat down and read it in a day, what a wake up call for me and my health issues. This book had all the answers to my recent tummy problems and what an isight this doctor has on what is really wrong with our food today. I've have stopped wheat and lost weight and my wheat belly. Everyon should read this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was just  an incredible book. Don't listen to those 1 or 2 star reviews. They have no idea what they are talking about this book was  just amazing. I can't I even express how much I loved it. Putting it into words is nearly impossible. Definitely consider reading this book!
B007W1BLN0|4.0|This is a great story of true events, anyone who likes documentary style movies will like this.  Sometimes life is crazy and you just need to escape.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Funny movie for kids and adults.  The Ice Age series didn't disappoint with this funny, cute story without being vulgar.
B00984668E|5.0|As much as have grown to appreciate this CD there are thing about it that, I had trouble adjusting to. First, I read that this album has a different drummer than the first 3 Sword albums.  This suggestion got into my head and affected the way I listened to the record. Personally, one of the things I loved about The Sword was the explosive drumming displayed on the first 3 albums.  I'm not saying that the new drummer is poor, i'm just saying that, to me, the band is being driven differently--It's a subtle difference, but it's there. That being said, I look at each work from a band as an independent piece of music.  i resist comparison and give this version of the band the benefit of the doubt. the reality is that although different, this incarnation of the band is excellent, and the new drummer does an terrific job.<br /><br />Another thing, is that this album has a &#34;cookie cutter&#34; feel to it. meaning all of the songs are uniform in length and structure...making this record seem commercially accessible.  There are no short burst instrumentals, or long instrumental jams that I had grown accustomed too on their previous records.  I'm not sure if this is a band breaking it's own conventions, or conforming to music industry conventions. There is not a bad tune on this record, I was just waiting for that instrumental.<br /><br />Whatever, The Sword is one of the best out there, and this album is great. No band gets more mileage out of their power chords! This album is a must have whether you are a longtime follower or somebody looking for a great hard rock/metal band to sink your teeth into.
B002NT3B52|3.0|It was an ok summary on dog thinking, however, didn't really uncover anything I wouldn't already know from living with a dog. I did like her guidance of how to respect dogs and their need for information. Not sure what I expected, but was hoping for more. Her observations are just that - observations.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Previous versions were missing key tunes, such as the classic Sweet Dream.  This one is complete just like the record i wore out as a kid.<br /><br />Don't agree w/ they way they broke up the songs. Song introductions (for upcoming) tracks are tacked on to the end of the previous track instead on as a an introduction to the actual track. if you have this CD on shuffle it doesn't quite work...you will hear a song intro then the track ends.  Minor complaint, no big deal, great live album, & Tull at their best.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show but don't have cable. It's great to be able to order what i want to watch on Amazon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|makes me laugh, and my grand-daughter was watching me and she was laughing i love laughing with my grand-children when i'm stressed i play so i can laugh some more
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I took a chance on this DVD due to the actors' reputations.  They were indeed wonderful.  The story was sweet, sad, funny and engaging.  I look forward to watching it again.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I bought this for a family member, she was over the moon, A perfect gift for a teenager, Happy days well done one Direction.
B00004TS0E|5.0|I love this movie and I always have.  Somehow the copy I had disappeared so I had to replace it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Loved the game<br />Would recomend it to others thats why I gave it fice stars. Great for adults and kids
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|it is a good game. reminds me of games I used to play. passes time if you are stuck with bed rest
0071422943|5.0|i wil love if the show you the thickness of the book . from the cover you can't tell how big this book really is. its  a really heavy book
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|This was a good movie, I liked it. It is an enjoyable film to watch and an interesting film to think about.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This  is a great Series  that keeps you engaged from start to finished and wanting more.<br />Can't wait to watch the Second Season.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much I love it love it love it this game is AWESOME<br />...I mean I feel bad for you if you have not played.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love leps world. at first I didn't think it would be that good but now I see that it is awesome. it is kind of like Mario bros. AWESOME. I love video games
1616550414|5.0|This book is a must have for any hardcore Zelda fan. it is high quality printing and in amazing condition. the hardcover is truly beautiful. with the cheap price of $20 you absolutely cannot go wrong with buying this.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Great to listen to when working out or on a run!!<br />This Album is unique from her last album and shows who Rihanna keeps going to the next level!!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|this is a real fun dinger dong. i liked it bub yea idid cool<br />fun game i enjoy this title. i like unlocking new items and trying to
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it`s so fun. If you like games like temple run then you`ll love this game. There is awesome rewards and new characters. IT IS AWESOME
B00BK5D95C|2.0|I think there are some biased reviews here, I gave this a listen and honestly I found the music boring and a little irritating.  To whoever said this is like Led Zeppelin and Yes having a baby, that is one messed up baby.
B00009APK1|5.0|This is a classic and very interesting and well done.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing this epic.
B0092QITO2|5.0|My husband was quite pleased that I ordered this for him.  Excellent movie, and with all 3 versions, he can watch it anywhere!
B007KOMTUI|4.0|For the first three seasons I gave MM 5 stars.  Fourth season was good but less depth of the characters particular last episodes.<br /><br />It is still the best show on the market at this time
143353097X|4.0|I've been using this Bible as my primary study for the two weeks that I have had it. While it is not my favorite study it pulls a close second. The study notes in this Bible are superb and defiantly worth the cost. The ESV translation is, in my opinion, the best. It is accurate and understandable. The design is cool and the binding is nice. This Bible is a single column formate, which I prefer.<br /><br />However, I have found that some of the print is light and there are no red letters. The page edges are not gilded, a feature I'd expect with an $80 Bible.<br /><br />This is a good study Bible and I do recommend it. I personally would rather have purchases one bound in genuine leather or calf-skin.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|The trilogy is excellent.  The translation into English is extremely readable.  The plot of each book varies from the earlier books, although there is a definite linkage.  Even the bad guys have credible characters.  Each of the books has been re-read with pleasure (for me an unusual experience).  It is regrettable Larsson did not write more in the series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|If only the characters so expensive to obtain. The game is fun and I find it funny that there's a fat cop and a dog with short legs chasing you.
B008LFY6NI|3.0|bought this for kids, and they do enjoy it for short periods of time.  interesting spin on old craft game.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I liv it I cant stop playing it the number 1 app it never gets old so many unique styles and so much fun
B007W1BLN0|3.0|The action is slow moving, acting is OK. Great scenes of the outdoors and wilderness. If you enjoy the outdoors you will enjoy this movie.
B00942X8PY|5.0|It has been a while since I've seen a game as original and satisfying as Huebrix.  Noodlecake Studios always seems to come out with the top games.  This one maybe one of their best.  Great game, recommended buy.
B00122HT04|5.0|I was trapped out of town due to a snow storm that hit on my way home from vacation. I didn't have any cd's with me, but this album saved my butt from pulling out all my hair. It's a great album and the buy-for-my-phone option was pretty cheap. I have no qualms about it. Great record.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Same game as it used to be.  Fun for the retro gamer.  You probably know what you're getting yourself into already so you don't really need this review.
B007H1HQW0|3.0|The actual glass cutter is cheap but easily fixed at the local hardware store. It's been fun making cool stuff.
B002APU580|4.0|This version of the movie was great- I think that Lizzie had a bit more of a modern sassiness to her character that made this film more relatable. Great remake of a classic!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|nice change from the angry birds game, lots of fun and little extras that you get everytime that you play
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this movie- it captures a lot of the little nuances from the book that other movies miss. The acting is great and the chmistry amongst the cast members makes it a must-see!
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|too sexual, the songs and singing are good but the lyrics are too suggestive. I purchased this music for a class I was teaching.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Each additional volume of this series makes you feel more and more as though you are physically living in the Silo. I couldn't stop reading. Read all editions in one sitting then when onto First Shift. Now I am getting ready to read Second Shift then Third Shift. Hugh Howey knows how to grab you and make you feel like part of the story and really makes you hate the world we are living in. I can see this happening, it probley already is. Wool is a MUST read!!
B0091LS07E|3.0|I was taken back to hear a rap mix in Girl on Fire. It totally ruined what I thought was a good Alycia Keys song. The rest of the album is good.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very good romantic book to read. I read it in two days, hard to put the book down.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Harfd to believe that anyone would go out of his/her way to take Tolstoy's great story and turn into a circus complete with clowns (who is this Vronsky anyway?).  Glitz and glitter and scene-chewing.  Don't bother.
0345803507|1.0|back for reading this book. What a total waste of my time.  I heard all the \\"noise\\" about<br />this book and ordered it, thinking it was going to be a great book, after the first book I thought ok the next two have to be better.<br /><br />I should have stopped at book one, and saved my money and time and space on my e-reader.<br /><br />if anything the sex was.....lacking (I will agree with one reviewer who said it felt like make-up sex)<br /><br />If you think this is Kinky<br />you truly have no clue..(I have friends in the lifestyle and these book, are/is running joke among them)<br /><br />If you really want to know about kink I strongly suggest this series [[ASIN:B008ZVO31I The Marketplace]]<br /><br />or any other of her books.
034553154X|4.0|Interesting calendar for both Game of Thrones and Marc Simonetti's fans. I really like it. Drawings are really exciting and deep.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Not only do my kids love this game, so do I... My daughter and I have horses so it is very interesting to watch my daughter take care of he digital horse then go to the pasture and interact with her real hire. Mom I have to groom her,  it will make her happy and make her feel good!  Love it!
0425263916|4.0|I'm enjoying the 2nd book in this Crossfre Trilogy but thus far its intense but still leaving something more to be desired.  The 1st book was tantalizing and this book is as well but I want us to get to the plot of things its moving a bit slow because of all the sex.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|Powerful movie. Works great thanks. Will watch a again in the future Goes good with dvd collection, Works for me.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|The case is sturdy and practical.  It works very well when it is used either vertical or horizontal.  Excellent fit for the Kindle. I love the color.
B001B1CBSQ|4.0|This is definitely a classic that helped pave the way for Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean.  Definitely a good one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS FUN AT LEAST IT NOT THE DEMO THAN IT WILL BE A WASTE U SHOULD GEF IT FUN OF FUN
B0058M94M0|5.0|I absolutely Loved Ozzy before for his open honesty, and this book just made me love him more. it was funny, and open and honest and I loved the stories of his life from his point of view and how he remembered them. I highly recommend this to any Ozzy fan.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Such a fun game! Once you get going and level up the pace turns to non-stop. Great way to kill time without a lot of thinking behind it, I'd say that's my kind of game :) and its relaxing too!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Used to play it on my labtob, and i,m glad to see it on my kindle.Got my daughter hooked also.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this book! It started off a little slow with all of the background information but once you got into it you can't put it down.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it. Nice way to see how the weather is up north.Have family living there, so i know what goes on.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|A good time wasting &quot;build your own park&quot; Sim BUT the touch recognition is awful. You have to either hold your finger for a few seconds to get a menu button to activate or you have to tap a dinosaur five or six times to collect from it. The game would get a much higher rating if the dev would fix it. By the way I played it on a Kindle Fire.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This was a good book, not excellent. It lacked some of Clancy's suspense it seemed and then the end just kind of wrapped things up way to fast and neat.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a stay-at-home mother with a Master's in IT, I was expecting this book to be critical of my decision to stay-at-home with my kids.  However, I am totally in love with the book.  She brilliantly supports women that choose to lean in, yet respects those that take the priceless opportunity to stay home with their children.  I especially like the chapter about not making choices on how to manage family/work until you actually have kids.
B00457X8BC|4.0|I got this book , the 1st Wallender book I think, because I am a fan of all too human, very intelligent,  slightly obcessive, socially retarded, and rather rumpled detectives. The movies hooked me on Wallender and I was delighted to see there was very little that was different than the books. Will I read more?. I  already have. We do see how intrspective Wallender is in the books and that adds a little more depth to the character. The fact that the books was pretty well adhered to in making the movies has prompted me to read another favorite .. Inspector Morse.
B00633W614|5.0|This is the second book in the series and it was literally a real page turner with all the characters introduced in the first book.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|all and all a pretty cool game.  some puzzles are challenging but game is way too short.  that's why I give it a 4 out of 5.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|Great movie. I didn't Think I would like it. But it really had some great action and a good story.
B00BHMF578|3.0|So Argo won the best picture oscar. Not sure why, because it definitely is not a stand-out movie. Ben Afleck's acting is rather average, and I am being complimentary.<br /><br />A few years ago, The Hurt Locker won best picture against Avatar. Apparently the lobbyists had been hard at work to get that vote pushed through. I get the sense again that Argo won for ulterior reasons - and not because of its merits as a supposedly &#34;best picture&#34; . . . .
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Both my Grand Daughters and I enjoy this game immensely. We usually end up laughing at the roller coaster graphics. It is a very fun game to play.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed it. Suspenseful. Better than DARK PLACES. Will consider reading more of her work because I enjoyed this so much.
B00000JCOV|5.0|It's been a while since I heard this album, and since my old copy was scratched (and I'm starting a CD collection) I thought I'd get this, and man, I love it! Still a blast from my teenage years and I'm happy with the delivery. For all those who generally enjoy the popular metal genre of the 90's like Korn, Sepultura, and even Limp Bizkit (I know, sorry :/), then you'll love this album.
B00170I7GG|5.0|I kind of wish I had just bought it instead of renting it. Bill Murray at his absolute best. Word.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|This music player has nothing better initial than the stock Google Music Player on my phone. It crashes constantly. I do like how you can create your own play list and that it communicates with isyncr. Those are the only pros I have for this app. Download something else.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|This book was very disappointing and made me feel ripped off. I almost wish she had never even written it if this was how the ending was going to be.<br /><br />At the end of the second book when Alex reappeared, I did not have good feelings about the romance in the third book. I do not like love triangles and hate that most of them end with someone being hurt or dead (exception Twilight - love the conclusion to that love triangle). This book did not help my feelings for love triangles and I was waiting the whole time for Lena to choose. As for Lena, I did not like her in this book at all. She seemed like an angry child the whole time and didn't really do anything spectacular. Everything went on around her while she just sat back and fretted over Alex while stringing Julian along. Every time she would try to justify her usefulness, she based it upon actions she did in the second book. As someone else mentioned in a review, Julian was just there. He had no character development and just seemed to be in this story for the love triangle tension. Sure he worked out a role for himself in the Wild, but we don't know how he felt about anything or how he was dealing with it. I also do not really know why Cora was there except to make Lena jealous. I did, however, like the character development in Hana. I would have rather read her story the whole time instead of jumping back in forth between hers and Lenas.<br /><br />Overall, I got to the end of the book & realized this was the end of the trilogy. I was left with a little anger at the unanswered questions and the overall lack of getting anything from this novel. Usually I ponder a novel for a few days after reading it and think upon the characters. This time I'm just angry at the lack of action, lack of connection with the characters, and the fact that nothing was resolved in the end. I found myself not liking Lena and liking Hana more, getting angry at Alex and feeling sorry for Julian, and just wondering why the author did the things she did. If you're looking for this novel to be on par with the first two, then you're going to be disappointed. You might do better just to find someone to give you an overview of it rather than wasting your time on reading it.

B00004WG2F|2.0|I found it disappointing and maudlin with underdeveloped characters.  Stereo-typical architypes ~ stoic men, pretty leading lady, bloody scenes, with a harlequin romance thrown in.<br />The story is mainly told through the narration of a native american whose character is also underdeveloped.<br />Brad Pitt's star character had little dialogue, as is usually the case in his films, he just has to be there, do some posturing, smile and gaze into women's eyes.  The romantic leading lady is very underdeveloped; she is the love interest only but to all three male leads.  Hhmmm, must've been great for Julia Ormond.<br /><br />You may enjoy the excellent cinematography, fabulous frontier mansion and wonderful costumes, all very authentic looking.  But the story is lacking and the music is oft-times too much or too loud.<br /><br />** Some profanity, sexual situations, much violence<br />*** Not suitable for small children or young teens.
B000FBJAEG|2.0|One star at best for a relatively thick book but Amazon rating appears to be two minimum, at least I can't change the two stars to one. Left a bunch of high lighted notes throughout the book ... implausible, improbable, and stupid. AND I am a fan of baldacci.
B009MO5960|5.0|My family and I love zombies and enjoy all the resident evils up till this one...2 of my teens were not thrilled with this one but my husband, oldest son, and myself really enjoyed it. The camera work is slowed down alot in this one which was my kids biggest complaint but we liked how you got to see the detail and action rather than have everything speed right past you where you dont always know whats going on. If you start out watching this expecting it to be bad and watch for things to nit pick at you will most likely hate it. If you sit back and get ready to be entertained and allow yourself to get lost in this next part of the story and the effects that were purposely added you will love it. I look forward to buying it soon to watch it again and add to our collection.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved season two as much as season one and three. Can't wait for season four...I highly recommend this series.  Love Maggie Smith in her role as Lady Grantham.
B00772M1F6|5.0|Love this album. It is a lot of fun to listen to and it makes travelling down the road a pleasant journey.
B008133MDK|5.0|A very enjoyable season.  I can't wait for season 3 -- someday in the distant future.  Sherlock and Watson are spot on; Moriarti is weird.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Very funny at times,  a little slow at first.<br />more for adults that remember older video games.<br />It was worth renting not buying
B006IYG5HE|5.0|A very enjoyable read. Once I started it I simply wanted to continue till I'd finished.<br />I enjoyed the protagonists.
B008RTE066|5.0|For a young person crazy about the Beatles this was a great gift.  He was on cloud nine on Christmas morning.
B00999DFP0|1.0|My wife purchased this as a gift and was so looking forward to enjoying them.  Right off the bat the picture quality is grainy and not sharp.  We didn't even bother to watch pass the luminous fish episode in season one as there were at lease three areas of no sound for 10 secs.  Do not buy and I would think amazon should listen to these comments as selling pirated DVDs is illegal!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I have alway loved the movie and i let my two year old watch it the other day. I had no idea she would love it as much as she has. She felt every emotion and verbalized it loudly. And still does every time she watches it again. Great purchase
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I really enjoyed the overall story.  It was definitely worth my time to read it.  I also enjoyed the hearing how the story came about.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is amazing and is fun and my child loves it and he also plays kingdom's ans lords too .
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This movie was so well done.  The acting is amazing, and a cinematography is gorgeous.  What a compelling story.  I heard about it because Benedict Cumberbatch stars in it, and I'm glad I watched it.  It has some funny moments and some frustrating moments, and it is an insanely sad movie (I cried so hard), but I loved every moment of it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|A bit needlessly complicated at times but still an enthralling read with plenty of fast action and intermittent sex scenes.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Keeps you interested and on edge throughout the book.  Would highly recommend it.  Quick and easy read.  Baldacci  never seems to disappoint.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|settlers is original, innovative and the replay value is high.  Get it with the cities and knights expansion and youve a great game!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My little ones love this game, so glad I got it for them. I personally had only chance to play few games and it is so fun.
B001XUPD94|1.0|HIS MOVIE CAUSED ME TO SLIP INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS.<br /><br />BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have a hard time getting up in the mornings. But I did NOT like my alarm on my DS. I much rather prefer this because it is cooler and less annoying. I love how you can change what you wake up to in the mornings. Goodbye DS!
B004EYSXT8|4.0|It is new research that is applicable to all students and teachers alike. It is a new frontier into the human species and shows how one can apply themselves more efficiently by 'deep' learning.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Like candy for your ears! or better!<br />SO beautiful! I listen to it over and over. Their talent is mind boggling.<br />These guys are truly inspired.
1401324649|1.0|I'm about 50% through this.  I've skimmed over tons of pages.  Most of the book is back-story. And a lot of that is political. I was more interested in what was going on in present time, but the book contains more of the past, pretty much from his childhood. Will finish the book just to finish it, but I anticipate skipping more and more pages and chapters as I go. You don't lose any of the story by doing that either.<br /><br />I don't have any connection to the characters. Don't like or dislike them, they are just there. Some funny stuff happens, but not often enough.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns. I really liked this book -- it's not a literary triumph, but it was certainly fun.
B007OWRBJK|1.0|I idolized this man foe 35 years never knowing he was a self absorbed, philandering liar who writes like a 16 year old. Pete, your defense of child porn is so derived and elaborate as to be fantastic. Did you really think we would swallow it? You were better off not releasing this and hiding behind blue eyes. Instead, you've exposed yourself as a fraud. I'm wondering what your children think about this mindless, narcissistic drivel. My guess is they've spent much of their lives working through it in therapy.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed certainly held my interest for the somewhat lengthy account of her hike up the Pacific Crest Trail. Apparently there's a fair amount of controversy about her, personally, but not knowing any of that when I read the book allowed me to read it without any bias. I thought she did an excellent job of capturing the highs, lows, and boredom that combined to make her hike so memorable.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I loved this book and you would never guess the ending Deff a must read book Bronte did a great job
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I really enjoyed the first half of the book, but then I wound up putting it down. I'm not a real fan of biographies and I think this one exemplifies why. The details just got to be overwhelming -- Isaacson certainly knows everything about Jobs, but I didn't want to read an account of what seemed like every moment.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Great documentary showing us how careful we need to be when buying food. And we need to act once for all to stop big corporations running the food industry mafia style. FDA should have the power to shut down a food company!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Delirium is set in an alternate world where the United States has decided that &#34;love&#34; is a deadly illness and they have come up with a cure.  However, some people are resistant to the cure or are secretly against it.  There's a whole other part of the world, The Wilds, where people live and are not cured.  Lena meets a boy who happens to be from the Wilds, and love happens, just before she is scheduled to be cured........
159562015X|5.0|We use this book to help evaluate recent hires into our firm - it's a way to ensure management is paying attention to what our employees need in terms of the types of work we give them. A very good resource.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|5 stars this book was good for a dictionary it has like every word in the English-language. If you want to know what a word means just look it up in here.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie, my second favorite only following Casino Royale. The old movies were great, but the special effects on these just don't even compare.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I found this book easy to read and having seen the movie, it did not make me enjoy the book any less.  It was a book that I just wanted to keep on reading.
B00B8PMWJI|4.0|It goes from gory to disturbing to hilarious with ease. Very inventive idea with very inventive directors. All 26 vignettes flew by quickly. I found it strangely enjoyable!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I would recommend this book to young adults and  adults  due to the  wide vocabulary. This book was both descriptive and enjoyable because it was a topic or a genre that is not easily accessible I enjoyed reading it. Honestly I did not dislike anything in this wonderful book.
143911000X|5.0|This book was in great condition when it came in. It looks awesome and I love watching this show and to have this book is just awesome. Thanks for the book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but does need more like flint and steel and more mobs. Also it needs eggs for all mobs and villagers and there eggs to.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie was ok. Kinda boring. But there were a couple of parts that had me on edge. Like I said , Not bad. Not great , either.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is amazing I love this game that I have this game on my mom phone and dad phone
B005FMZWD8|5.0|Nice look, easy to view due to its good size. Recommend it for the outdoors lovers. Very confortable wrist belt
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 8 year plays this as often as I will let her. I love the lack of violence, and it doesn't make her crazy with frustration.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Our son is a busy neuroscientist and has no time for watch this well written, well driected and well acted sit-com.  We get him a new season each Christmas and watches them while waiting in airports for flights.  We of course enjoy them as they are broadcast.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book gives the casual reader a wholly new view of Lincoln as a gifted, ingenious and highly sophisticated politician, something rarely conveyed in civil-war era histories.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Its very easy to use especially for first timers. I love its simplicity. Sometimes a little late on notifications but overall its great.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|Rather dismal, insular life on one of islands off N. Scotland well described.  Excellent writing, good characters and dialogue.  A good mystery story with lots of suspects.
0307352145|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, right from the introduction. I even underlined parts of it, which I haven't done since college, because it was so profoundly relevant to me personally. It's well-researched but not dry or textbookish. The author is very candid about her own experiences as an introvert in a world that really pushes us to be extroverts...or at least to act like them. She poses questions about the social, political and even religious endorsement of a specific personality type - one chapter titled &#34;The Myth of Charismatic Leadership&#34; was very interesting. I only wish more extroverts would pick up this book, but they won't, because they're pretty comfortable with things as they are.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is quite fun and very interesting, As you proceed in the game it becomes more difficult and challenging.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|loved it.  unexpectedly entertaining for animation or computer generation film.  alot more reality than expected.  surprised and satisfying. will look for sequill.
0761169431|5.0|For a tween who seems to have everything Star Wars related, I didn't think he had this one.  Since he likes paper airplanes, this would be the next best thing for him.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Completely addicting!!!! I love all the good guys and absolutely want to go through the screne at the bad guys!! Walter is very great and Peter is hot!
B00133KFGW|4.0|Shipped very quickly and loved the price. They want to many words for their reviews on these products but will consider buying again.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you can picture a book like Robinson Crusoe, staring Macgyver, with a writing team including Janet Evanovich and Albert Einstein, you may come close to The Martian. This book is fun, funny, futuristic, feasible, and just plain fantastic. Finally the truth comes out, engineers are the real Super Heroes.<br />This book is timely considering the refocus of our Apollo space program from exploration to possible colonization. This book is believable because potential real problems are fixed with feasible real solutions implemented by a human who will not accept failure. And last, and maybe most important, this book is just plain fun to read. The blend of character development, humor, and drama makes it one of those books you can hardly wait to pick up and hate to end.<br />Mr. Weir, I am looking forward to your next book. I hope you include Super Hero Mark Watney, engineer.
B009JBZH54|5.0|$24.99 for one of the best triologies ever in blue ray format?  What's not to love!!  The 5 discs  includes the movies and behind the scene look for the DK and DKR.  Absolutely loved the movies as well as the deal offered by Amazon.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Very good read. Well written and timely. It is like The Hunger Games meets Pac Man.<br />For those of us young enough to participate in a virtual world, like World Of Warcraft, but old enough to be concerned about the decline of America, this is a believable and frightening story. Every day and everywhere we see more and more young people immersed in a virtual world to escape from the reality of their life. It takes hard work for a person, in the real world, to become who he wants to be. If we only had The Oasis to give us a purpose in life.<br />Thank you Mr Cline, for making me glad I love to read and for making me think about the future. I am looking forward to your next book
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love romance novels and books where characters have courage and strength, even though they don't realize it.  Love grows slow
B00BESJYAY|5.0|It's true. I've never seen a surfing movie I didn't like. So, yeah, my opinions on them can be a little skewed. But really, this movie is so much more than a movie for surfing junkies (although you'll definitely get your fix.)  it's the story about a boy who grows up to be an amazingly strong, positive, and influential young man despite having the odds stacked against him. It's a story about an unlikely father/son bond between two once-strangers. And, yes, it's a story about surfing... But you can replace surfing for so many other aspects of life and have the same result. This kid knew what he wanted and he never backed down and because of it he became a legend and changed the lives of the people around him and those who looked up to him.<br /><br />You don't have to know the true story of Jay Moriarty and Frosty Hesson to be moved by this movie. But once you see it, you won't forget it any time soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a fabulous book to read! Once u begin u won't be able to finish. I love this author and I love this book! Be sure to read the previous 2 first though!
0307592731|4.0|This isn't Bill Bryson's &#34;A Walk in the Woods&#34; but it was a good easy read.  I had to admire Cheryl Strayed for her ability to stick with something so physiclally difficult and painful in addition to working through her emotional pain.
140053271X|5.0|no problems whatsoever! Came in a sleeve with its own charger and after it was charged up, it worked beautifully!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! I can't stop watching it. It makes me want to go back in time and live the life of these characters. Honestly, probably the best show I've seen in a long time!!
B005Q4CM0Q|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this movie. Better than I expected. Great condition. Again very pleased with the purchase! Thanks!!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This book is comprehensive and informative. Sufficiently technical while being easy to understand. A great reference and a must read.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Wasn't sure in the beginning if this would be something I would like. Started watching and can't stop! And now my 17 year old is deeply hooked and wants to go into that field. The visual effects are some of the most graphic yet believable that I've seen in a series. HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking for a good crime to solve!<br />Very pleased with this purchase!! Thanks!!
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Great videos !!! Great for a gift for children or other family members. Our kids found out we bought this and they wanted it.

0439023513|2.0|** spoiler alert ** SPOILER!!!<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br /><br />If you haven't finished the book DON'T READ THIS!!!<br /><br />It's taken me awhile to write this review and so it's not fresh in my mind but I remember liking a large portion of this book until about when there's a significant death. The reason it shook me so hard is because the start of the entire series was to protect this one person who ends up dying? And not dying in the way she was a martyr for the cause, dying in a way that she was one of the random people who blow up. And then the ending, what kind of ending is it? One that sucks. It's depressing. She's miserable and ends up with Peeta but there's no sense that she wants to, more of a \\"well I guess I have nothing else so you will do.\\" If she ended up with him because the Capitol ruined her world but she had the love of her life so she would survive kind of feeling I would have rated it so much higher. The capitol won in the end. They defeated her. I would have actually preferred they killed her off and then a new generation could live in a capitol free society. I enjoyed the series, but the ending just ruined it for me
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is very great for the go and is convient to play on the go remember to subscribe to Konley corperation at woodierfever932 only on xbox just send me a request and i will build you a free rollercoaster by Konley him self.  ( ALL RIGHTS RESERVED TO KONLEY-CORP.)
B002WTC92E|2.0|eh... This book was ok...There's a little too much language for my tastes and a LOT of sex. Think of sex and the city type theme.  That might be kind of unfair to compare to sex and the city though, because I don't find those characters vapid and shallow like these ones.  So much is focused on status and the perfect ring and guys who are great in bed even if they have no other redeeming qualities.  I expected a lot more and perhaps that's why I was disappointed. The ending wasn't even an ending, leaves you hanging, no closure. (I hate books like that unless they are an open series - maybe she's done another IDK, I won't read to find out.) Not one i'd recommend or read again.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|I enjoy the Resident Evil series, and also like the actors as well, it is a very good movie. thanks
0143038419|1.0|Ugg... I really hate rating a book I never even finished. I really hate never finishing a book. But this I couldn't handle. I got to page 200 or so out of 331 and it took me a WEEK. I never take this long to finish a book. Usually I finish a book in a day or 2. Undaunted only took me 4 days, which is 800 pages long. I just couldn't get into the book. Perhaps it's because I couldn't identify with the author at all.  She seemed so incredibly shallow and her priorities are so skewed, which is no wonder why, even with how privileged she is, she still isn't happy.  Another reviewer said this was like \\"How Stella got her grove back but with yoga and white people.\\"  I completely agree.  But I was bored out of my mind reading this. I kept thinking, maybe it will get better, and maybe it does. But I didn't want to spend another week or more in case it didn't.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved ARGO. Waited to see it at home on my computer.  A must-see movie. Had me on the edge of my seat even knowing how things turn out.  Very gripping and suspenseful.
1416972250|5.0|I had the hardest time putting this one down. I did foresee a plot twist and was pleased with the way it turned out, and I love being right. I must say clary is not my favorite of characters by far. Especially at the beginning of this book she is so incredibly selfish it's not even funny. I think there was maybe one or two swear words. There was some more incest in this one. Some light romance. Nothing really heavy or detailed. I liked the ending. It wrapped everything up with a nice bow. I really disliked the death of children and would have preferred some of the adults to go instead but that's me. It ended on a happy note and others might complain that's not life, I agree. that's why I love reading and fairy tales because life is depressing and morbid enough as it is. And I like to think the impossible fight against evil can be won by the good. I am curious as to what the next book will be about since the war is over.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The book makes sense that everyone does have a different love language.  It is an easy read and worth reading even if you are in a good marriage.  This can help you understand things better and it is simple.
1416972242|4.0|I enjoyed this book even more than the first. It was super fast paced and a ton of action. Learn a lot more about everything and become fonder of the characters. Still a little creeped out about the whole incestuous brother sister love but I'm starting to think there is more to his lineage and maybe he isn't actually her brother. Or maybe I'm just hoping. My curiosity is enough to keep me going into the next of the series. Little language and a little sexual remarks but not dirty. Not sure I'm passing this on to my kids til they are much older though.
B00AGKH6D8|4.0|I preordered this cd as a Valentine's Day gift for my husband. We love Joe Bonamassa and have ordered his cd's through Amazon in the past. I had received an e-mail from Amazon telling me that this was his newest cd being released and I could preorder for the best price. I was very pleased with the low price guarantee through Amazon and the cd did come during the expected time it was promised. The reason for my 4-star rating is that we were disappointed that the cd contains many artists and not a lot of Joe Bonamassa. I knew there were other artists on the cd and we've purchased another cd where he collaborated with Beth Hart and found we LOVE her so I wasn't scared off by other artists being featured. This cd just didn't resonate as well with my husband as other cds have. If you are looking for Joe Bonamassa's music, there are better cds to purchase, in my opinion.
1606863622|2.0|** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br /><br />I like how Nicholas Sparks portrays romances, and I'm not a romance buff, I find them easy reads. I cannot stand finishing a book feeling more depressed and pessimistic at the end than before I ever read the book. What I don't like is building up this support for this couple the entire book and then in the end they don't end up together. It leaves me feeling so depressed. This passionate against all odds we can make it through anything love just peters away? And no matter how much they love each other and still do, it's ok to marry someone else because waiting for him was just too hard? No wonder half the world gets divorced. I know that is how \\"real life\\" works. But when I'm reading a book, or watching a movie I want to be \\"entertained.\\" If I want real life I'll watch the news or look at divorce statistics. The end really makes it or breaks it for me hence such a low score. I'm a fan of fairy tale endings. Make me cry at the beginning, or the middle, but not at the end.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|Although the acting was solid, the plot was thin, unimaginative and fairly predictable. I can't say this movie adds in any meaningful way to the Star Trek legacy. Mostly just a restating of character traits, how they came together in the years before the first TV series. It would have been nice to see some reference to future plot lines, such as a glimpse into how Christopher Pike was injured. Instead, just another blockbuster-type flick about alien threats, etc. etc. etc.
0385738765|4.0|** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br /><br />Ok so this one wasn't as good to me as the first. This one was, however, way creepier. Like zombie-ish guys eating your body parts creepier. Except they aren't dead so they aren't really zombies, but you get the point. But I loved the Maze Runner, I was so enthralled. I must admit this book kept me hooked, I think James Dashner writes just for me because I zoom through all his books whether I like them in the end or not. What I didn't like about this one was that book one left you on a cliff hanger, but I had so many questions I had to go to the next for the answers. This book didn't have any answers. I didn't have any more insight at all to WICKED or the end game. I only ended up asking more and more questions. Not just the big questions either. Did anyone else wonder how the girls got through the tunnels without the metal ball things chopping off their heads? They all made it? And where did they get their weapons when they were underground the whole time? And they didn't meet any Cranks?? The whole we were underground so you didn't see us wasn't enough for me. It almost could've been an in-between book in my pov because while I get they were necessary \\"trials\\" or whatever they just betray him and he's back where's he started at the beginning of the maze runner. I'm all for a challenge but now it's getting kind of ridiculous. When does it ever end?I'm sad about losing Chuck, he was one of my favorite characters, but there was still Minho who was always a close second. But we lose him for a lot of the book. We are stuck with Thomas. And I get Thomas is the serious guy but he is with Teresa or Brenda the whole time and IMO the romance part of the book sucked. Dasher is definitely one of my fav authors but he definitely does better with action/thrill/suspense/adventure than romance. But it didn't change my rating too much because honestly, who read this book for the romance anyway? But I will definitely read the Death Cure because it is the last so it HAS to have answers right?!?! I hope
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I've been waiting for accuradio to have an app for my kindle fire-----fabulous!!! Great channel selections and sound. Thanks for a great product!
1423113454|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's a new series by Rick Riordan (Percy Jackson) and this time instead of Greek Gods and myths it's Egyptian. It's a great and fun way to learn about it all. I will be continuing the series. It's a \\"young adult\\" novel, but those seem to be my favorite they are fun, exciting and simple. And there are twists, you don't know what's going to happen in the end until it does. There's no language and no sex even though there's romance. Finished this book in a day.... now if they make a movie of it, I hope they don't ruin it like they did Percy Jackson.
B007MCTTHY|3.0|This game is similar to my old Palm game Plumber Pete.<br /><br />Except that Plumber Pete made use of the entire screen.  This app shows the puzzle in a tiny area,  with strange items around the border.<br /><br />Plus,  Plumber Pete had the water starting to flow as you solved the puzzle.
1400032717|3.0|I am a bit torn by this book.<br />The pros: I absolutely love the first half of the book. It is totally enjoyable. I love reading from the pov of an autistic child. It totally reminds of my daughters line of thinking (she has autism as well). The tangents she goes on and her form of logic which to most is completely illogical. I love how it portrays the difficulties of raising a child with autism.<br />The cons: quite a bit of language. This is not really a mystery. It focuses more on the inner thoughts of a boy with autism. This didn't really bother me much but it was labeled as a mystery you solve the mystery in the first half of the book. I'm also a little concerned about his fascination with his knife and desire to use it on almost everyone. I am also saddened by the story. His home life is pretty messed up. It focuses a lot on the negative.<br /><br />All in all it was a decent read. Probably mean more to those who know someone with autism or are interested in them. Not everyone would enjoy this book. He goes off on tangents often and makes lots of lists and diagrams. These were some of my favorite parts because it reminded me of my daughter. I just hope that those who do read it don't stereotype all autistics this way. My daughter shares a lot of similarities. But the obsession with violence (always wanting to hit or knife someone who touches him), lack of feelings (most I have known just have trouble expressing them, but experience lots) and reasoning that the idea of God is just silly are not common with all those affected.  This opens up the mind of ONE autistic child, not all.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Ang Lee turned an impossibly complicated book into a very touching and elegant film. While doing justice to Hollywood formula, he does an excellent job telling the story.
0375842209|2.0|So I'm kind of at a loss with this book. It was really long and not just in pages but pretty slow. I know it's not action but I had a hard time wanting to pick this book back up when I put it down. I wasn't really a fan of the description death gives the world. Like a dark chocolate sky and a breakfast colored sun. Didn't really do it for me, although it often made me hungry. On the other hand it was very uniquely written and for that I give it props and that's why I finished it. You do feel for Lisel but since it is narrated by death the entire story is given a non-emotional feel. It was also pretty anti-climatic since death tells you a basic synopsis of what's going to happen before it happens. It's pretty depressing. Her entire life. I know that this was a terrible time in the world and this book is written from the German's view which was a good spin. But was there really anything else that could happen to this poor girl? And the end was just miserable. One of those endings that make you want to throw the book across the room.  I love historical novels that give some light a glimmer of hope or some glimpse into positive humanity.  This is not my style of book it was dark and depressing but considering the incredibly high ratings, I am one of the few.
B00555X8OA|5.0|What a thought provoking book.It was enlightening and started a whole new line of application to life around me. It was well worth it.
1423140605|5.0|Great book. This one focused more on the other characters than Percy and Jason which was nice. I liked how we got into annabeths head finally. The prophecy this time wasn't so cut and dry since there were more than one at the same time. The characters are great and action was good. The book jumped into quests pretty quickly for how long it was. I felt this time we got more into character development. There isn't as much light hearted humor. It seems the responsibilities are really weighing on Percy. Overall a great book but a terribly horrible cliff hanger ending. If you don't do cliff hangers definitely wait til you have the next book ready before starting this one. Like other riordan books no language, and just pg romance.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I thought it was a good movie. Although it was not Daniel Craig's best picture. There are other James Bond movies that I liked better,
0545259096|2.0|** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br /><br />I loved the first, liked the second and the third? Ugh. I couldn't get into it. The imagery was great but that's about it. I end up liking Cole more than any other character and he was the leader Sam needed to be. And the ending? That's it? Are you kidding me?!?! Freekin ridiculously craptastic ending! There is absolutely no closure! With anything or anyone. What was she thinking? Now I feel my time was wasted on this series. So disappointed. They should attach Prozac to this book so you don't want to strangle someone at the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is  entertaining and fun. If you are bored just turn this on and you will have a lot of fun
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a book I picked up and just could not put it down!  I liked the author's presentation.  From the first page he had my attention.  The plot flowed from one event to the next. At times humorous, other times full of suspense.  At least twice in the book I had to fight back a few tears.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was great. It told the story of inner and outer trials and tribulations of her hike. I love stories like this.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Dr.Panda is amazing I love all there apps they don't make it to hard or to easy. The game also never ends so no levels.This one is my fav and also hospital.GO PANDAS!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Not to say a fake movie is required in all conflicts but thinking outside the box in a way that undermines the opposition can have just as much value as boots on the ground.  Keep up the good work Hollywood!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I adore this GAME it's amazing it teaches me about maths and English.<br />It also teaches me about how hard it is for my parents and I respect my parents and adults. As a kid I love it and it's entertaining. I would recommend this for any kids no matter what age.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is great for a free one. it gets the job done a nd is easy to use. thanks!
B00280LYIC|4.0|Good book and exemplary development of the first book of Percy's first adventure SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS and that is awesome
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I was cool seeing all the missing scenes.  The packaging was really nice as well. Watched it so many times, I know it by heart.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|This upgrade offers improvements but lacks one feature I really wish it had - the ability to hide or delete posts on your timeline/wall.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This was a great movie for the whole family. My kids were absolutely memorized through the whole movie. I enjoyed the movie as well with my kids and especially seeing old games that came from the time when I was a kid. Plus my son could point out most of the characters.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Love my kindle, The size is perfect .<br />I can't compare to other products because I've not used them<br />Easy to use<br />It was a Christmas gift
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Based on seeing the trailers, I was intrigued by the movie's concept, The one and only action Scene at the beginning of the movie was very good, but overall I thought it became very tedious. I'm a fan of Denzel Washington, but his character, a self-absorbed liar, hiding a huge secret, portrayed a limited range of emotions. In other words, his character was a bore and watching someone like that for 2 hours, was just not enjoyable. John Goodman's character had flair and he played the part to the max. But he was only a bit player in this movie.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Enjoyable, but John and Kate are getting close to mandatory retirement. You only get to kill so many terrorists single handed. They've been replaced by drones. Deville should be able to squeeze one more &#34;things need to be settled&#34; before moving on.
B00407PNWO|4.0|You have never seen an older man so happy, as to get this for his 89th birthday. One of his favs.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|I was looking for something that would act as a lab notebook which would do the following:<br />- take handwritten notes with a stylus<br />- have the ability to deal with a drawing or diagram of test setup<br />- output to dropbox<br />- look neat and organized when finished<br /><br />This program, along with another free app from developer accomplish this.  The 2 apps work together to create one document that satisfies all my needs. This is the ultimate lab notebook!
B004LQEYAG|4.0|Ah yes, Robert Redford was so handsome in this, and Paul Newman wasn't bad looking at all, either. Thank you.
0345803507|5.0|This book ends the trilogy well, however, leaves you wanting more...much more.  Hope to see more from Christian and Anastasia... Please...Please...Please....
B0007939NO|4.0|An old classic movie that I have always enjoyed. The storyline is an interesting premise, and the acting was good. I'm glad to own it, so I can watch it again when I am in the mood.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|You cannot read just one of the books in this trilogy.  Exciting love story with a twist.  Loved them all..
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Really great  movie--both Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root were so good in it. A must have for romantics like me.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Loved the sounds of the classical album.  It brings back memories that are very special to me.  Would recommend this to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe haven is a unique book. I'm not much of the sappy love story type, but this book really moved me. From Jo to Alex, the ending almost broke my heart. It was bittersweet. I've never really been touched by a novel where I had to leave a review but it is truly amazing. I highly recommend this novel.
B00A1U2SVS|3.0|Not a bad live compilation. Really miss the gritty sound of the original cuts when you listen to how clean this recording is....
B007IK44CK|4.0|Fairly fast paced with a few good twists as to be expected in the MI franchise. I liked the supporting cast and the story line was quite good. Worth a view if you have a couple of hours to kill.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As a true dog lover I would recommend this book as required reading to all dog lovers. The writing near the end on what it is like to be free of your worn out body and able to run through the field again as a pup brings tears to my eyes just to think again about it.......
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it.everybody will love it. I  like into the  mines.I recommend<br /> It for everybody.you  Will love it. So get the game.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a real page turner, I needed a lighter read after The Winter of the World and this fit the bill perfectly. This goes to dark places but all in the quest to tell Cathy's story.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Just great music.  Really great blend of traditional with modern elements.  This is not just a bluegrass album.  You really cannot pigeon hold this.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app is way better than the epidemic app that I had first.  Glad that I spent the money.  Love that I can play a complete game in less than an hour.
B003Y5H574|5.0|I wish I took advantage of the UltraViolet Digital Copy. The movie is GREAT - one of those movies that makes you smile when you are watching it and you don't even notice.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this series.  Had a hard time putting it down, couldnt wait to read the next book.  I cant wait for the movie to come out.
B003L77G06|5.0|Watch Modern Family. This show is hilarious and you don't need to watch all of the episodes or seasons in a row but it helps make the inside jokes and innuendos more humorous knowing the story line.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was surprised with the ending.  There is no way to guess the ending.  Again well written and great details.  Makes you think what would you do if you had to live in a world like this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book pulled me in right from the beginning. I felt so many emotions reading this book...Sky and Holder are perfect in so many ways. This story was heartbreaking but it was also funny, sweet and I have to say that Holder is certainly very appealing! I literally swooned over almost everything he did! Colleen Hoover is extremely talented and her characters are well thought out and developed. I felt like I was on this journey right along with Sky and Holder! I laughed, I cried,I gasped,and yes...I swooned! I would 100% recommend this book! Definitely one of the best I have read in a while!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldnt put my kindle down until I finished the book.  Im glad I was able to get it cheaper than going to the book store.  Definitely worth my money.
0140544518|5.0|For young children of high conflict divorce, this lovely little book is an excellent resource for developing critical thinking skills.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book.  Well written and I love the details that the author gave.  Made it easy to visualize what was happening.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A well written book that tells of the chivalry and humaneness of the &#34;enemy&#34; in WWII. Not often do you find WWII books written from the other point view. Not often do you find any WWII books better written than this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the book.  I was intrigued the whole time.  Im sitting on pins and needle to finish the series, to see how it turns out. I went back and forth on deciding whether or not to read it.  Im glad I decided to read it.,
B007EC27QM|4.0|Great calculator. I use it for work and home. Worth the small fee. If your good at &quot;10 Key&quot; you'll love it.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|The puzzles are done well. This app uses the same puzzles with different pieces missing to create more of a challenge.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had not watched the first part of season three of Walking Dead and after researching the internet I discovered u could buy each episode on Amazon for 1.99 per episode! So excited cause now I can catch up!!
B000IDEORY|5.0|This DVD and all the other items in this package is A-ONE!!!  I love it!  This is on the top of my favorite movies.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|It's no Spaceballs but I wouldn't be surprised if today's kids tout it as much as we touted Spaceballs.<br /><br />The movie's pretense is incredibly common in B-films &#34;Space Nazis invade&#34; but unlike those films this one actually makes it enjoyable!  In the same vein as &#34;Inglorious Bastards&#34; this film was never theatrically released state-side (perhaps because of a Palin-like president depicted) but in a way that only adds to the spice of the film.  Best experience: when we got our super serious film major friends to watch it and actually enjoy it (they usually have scathing comments about why we scientists shouldn't pick films).
B008G8SFGO|5.0|All I can say is that if you agree with the new KISS you should buy this album, is way better than sonic boom, if you don't like KISS anymore then just don't buy it and keep it to yourself and keep listening to the old albums, in my humble opinion, KISS has always been and always will be Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, I don't care what Ace and Peter says, I've always been a KISS fan not an Ace or Peter fan, so my loyalty is and always will be with them, and KISS sounds better now, leaving Paul's voice aside hehehe.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I'll admit, I only started listening to Kansas after watching Supernatural and hearing &#34;Wayward Son&#34; during the major recaps but I enjoyed the music enough to actually buy the CD.
0307341577|5.0|Very convoluted plot that literally kept me on the proverbial edge of my seat!!  She is an awesome writer.  After reading Gone Girl I could not wait to read her other two books and this one did not disappoint.  One of the best &#34;mystery&#34;, suspense writers we have.  I hope she keeps writing!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|An amazing fantasy novel ,crafted carefully and encompassing a detailed world full of mystery , intrigue and  colorful characters. A must have definitely.
B004SMD4H2|3.0|Enjoy the series.,Too bad disc three was unreadable on two different machines.<br />Had to send the set back for a refund.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|A good movie showing what a good sense of values and a feeling self worth can do to change an individual. I really enjoyed watching this movie.
B002M9WW30|1.0|My rocky v disc did not work. When I tried to return it they were out of stock.  I like the movies themselves just upset about the dysfunctional disc.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It felt at times that katniss was in 4 different scenes at one time making it hard to follow. There was times when I wanted the author to slow down, but she it seem like she shot straight out of a canon and never did. Disappointing the end of the triology.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|It's Planet Earth. On Blu-Ray. With David Attenborough narrating. It's the greatest television series ever made and it was filmed in hi-def to begin with- on Blu-Ray it's literally jaw droppingly amazing.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Loved it al the way thru! Ben is amazing! This story is wonderful. A must<br />See! Hollywood has a hit, Oscar Worthey! Cinematography is on point!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Once I started on this trilogy I could not put it down!  It had everything...romance, mystery, and so much more.  I will read this again in the future.  You can't go wrong if you buy the trilogy!  Excellent writing too.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Loved this movie and loved Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones in it. So sweet and touching.  It's one I will watch again.
B001DPHDCY|3.0|It's ok but I prefer the original version. If your a Jim carry fan you'll love it. Me? Not so much.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|Not much plot. Not a great movie at all. Don't waste your time.  Watch a TV rerun. Did I say I thought it was weird? Good grief.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't start watching Downton Abbey until after the first two seasons were over.  I watched Season 1 with my daughter and fell in love with it, then I got Amazon Prime so I could catch up on Season 2.  The actors, scenery, and costumes are all wonderful.  Historical events are woven into the story, which is set in my grandparents' era.  It's definitely not a soap opera because of the great attention to detail, fast-moving plot lines, and rich characterization.  That is why I gave it five stars!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Relatively good acting and compelling story. My problem is the infusion of political spin to minimally criticize the total ineptitude of the Carter administration in handling the situation.  Moreover, the end of the movie includes dialog by Carter on how wonderful his diplomacy was to allow the release of the hostages.  Simply, the hostages were released on Reagan's inauguration day 1981 because the Iranians knew that the proper methods would be used to extract our citizens!  Moreover, the filmmakers try to denigrate the Shah to somehow justify the takeover of the embassy.  I look forward to Affleck's future movie on Benghazi!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Must be heard to be believed . Do yourself a favor and GET THIS ALBUM NOW! Long live Sixto !!!!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I felt so lifted and encouraged after reading this book...I wish I could just have these spiritual leaders follow me around constantly to remind me of the power of love and the laws of attraction! It is easy to lose sight sometimes.
B006FH2W4O|3.0|As a boy I truly enjoyed the Hornblower books. Master and Commander brings back memories of intense action with broadsides, gunpowder smoke and wounded sailors.<br />The book is written by a real expert, sometimes too detailed, but still holds the interest. Lots of peculiar terms, I´m, glad I read it in my Ipad, with the built in dictionary.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was one that was impossible to put down. It's so beautiful. I should have slept, I have school tomorrow but I don't even care. I have never cried so hard over a book.
1592402038|4.0|This is a nice resource to have around. Great rules and devices to remember them. A memorable book on punctuation and grammar. That said, it's not really a &#34;thumb to find it&#34; kind of book. So it's not the easiest of references.
B00AWBNNAG|5.0|I want lego candy machines in the guide. The machines are from electrydragonite and on the computer I can` t. Please can you do that.
B000IDEQTK|3.0|The acting and a most of the behavioral responses are typical American ones.<br />I was not drawn in or especially moved with this movie. The time period picked was a<br />good one since it shows the era of the 1920's with the new Jazz, Flappers and the beginning of modern<br />woman and the boom of free thinking. So with a great deal to pick from<br />this movie had great potential with some very good actors but it never truly got off the ground.<br />I ended up wanting to know more about the characters since most did not get developed<br />with much finesse or thought.
B007REV4T8|5.0|We find out about both Ms past and 007s past too.  And why home is not where his heart is.  This one'is one  of the best that Daniel Craig has done yet
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Oh come on, this movie is awesome!! If you like Disney or gaming you'll love it! The attention to graphic details is wonderful and the story is pure Disney.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|All I can say is awesome.  It never fails to bring it on.  Once again.the iron throne is really a killer of realms.  People who like suspense and stories in stories will love Game Of Thrones.

B0079XNWQA|5.0|Once upon a time there were four Liverpudlians who came to America and crashed the music scene with happy, ingenious, witty, thoughtful, existential, and just plain catchy pop-rock tunes.  They inspired a generation of musicians for decades to come and they are still considered the Gods of rock and roll.  Then, around the same time as the aforementioned invasion, a court jester (in a coat he borrowed from James Dean) wrote existential poetry, set it to music, and became &quot;The Voice&quot; of that same generation, and inspired folk singers for decades to come and is still considered to be the God of folk-rock.  A very short while after that, a very colorful Beatnik tripped into the lives of that same generation, and he inspired a psychedelic movement within both the folk and the rock and roll camps.  He has become somewhat diminished with the passage of time, but his influence is still felt today.  For those of you of who can figure out the first two icons but are left dangling in the wind on the third, his name was Donovan Leitch and he was a very groovy-groovy fellow.  His music infused the rock and roll stylings of The Beatles (#1 above) and the existential lyricism of Dylan (#2) above, and he salted his very happy music with some jazzy influences and some eastern classical Indian spices.  His reign as the King of &quot;Flower Power&quot; faded after 1969, but his influence has been picked up over and over by various folk-rock artists for the decades since.<br /><br />I spend more time and money on rebuilding old vinyl albums into new CD's, especially properly remastered ones, because there are not very many &quot;new&quot; artists I really like enough to follow step by step.  Occasionally there is a solid new album by someone with some very interesting and ingenious imagination, but career-wise, with very few exceptions, I have not gobbled up modern music artists like I used to!  By &quot;modern&quot; of course I am referring to the first decade of this new millennium!  Oh sure, there are hold-overs from the 80's and 90's, Sting, Dave Matthews, Melissa Etheridge, and a few others who have managed to make a career out of staying contemporary and still hanging onto their original fan base, and of course Paul McCartney and Dylan have held on for dear life with fabulous results, but as far as NEW Contemporary Artists are concerned, there is one who stand above all others, one artist whom I feel will have a long and serious career in music, and will remain relevant and accomplished for decades to come.  There is one new Beatnik, Beatle, Pop Poet, for the ages who has arisen from the music scene in the last decade who is a true artist, a lyrical genius with the wit, the thoughtful provoking creativity, and the existential prose and nature, to be considered a great contemporary artist.  There is a reason this young man's music appeals to ages 8 to 80, and a reason for his popularity.  He is a &quot;happy&quot; musician, with bare feet, a kind face, a strong voice, a smile that genuinely extends from teeth to eyes, and a creative blend of folk, rock, and jazz, that appeals to everyone with any pop sensibilities.  Let's face it, Jason, Mr. A to Z, is just a very likeable fellow.  He is a Beatnik in the tradition of Donovan, a pop tunesmith in the tradition of The Beatles, and a folk poet in the tradition of Dylan.  He also has a great vocal delivery, and terrific band backing him.<br /><br />Jason Mraz, rose up out of San Diego coffee houses (where else would you find a beatnik?) and popped out an unusual debut album Waiting For My Rocket To Come.  I don't remember where I saw his promo of the album (not an &quot;MTV&quot; fan or watcher) but I remember You And I Both, and The Remedy, really caught my attention, and my Beatnik Wife, who is really more open-minded than I am, brought it home and we both fell in love with this kid.  The music was fresh and bouncy, the lyrics really promising that a new talent was &quot;born&quot;.<br /><br />Ever since We Sing We Dance We Steal Things, Jason has really come into his own with some of the best songwriting for the new millennium.  That Caribbean Crunch tinged with Reggae, or the often introspective acoustic angst flavored with wit and wisdom that can escape an unsuspecting listener, shows the true genius of his poetry and musical talent.  He does for today's youth, what Dylan, The Beatles, and Donovan did for us, and yet his style and approach are both fresh and retrospective enough to appeal to a broad diversity of generations.  Any &quot;adult&quot; with an open mind, as well as good taste in music, should be able to appreciate if not love, Jason Mraz!  His &quot;Beautiful Mess&quot; album upped the ante on adult contemporary music listening, making his older compositions even more grand and appreciable, while providing one of the best recorded live concerts of the new era.<br /><br />Now Jason has released what I think is his most powerful, most beautiful, and most artistic creation to date.  If this guy continues in this vein, he will be the John Lennon of this and the next generation.  Love Is A Four Letter Word is without reservation a modern classic masterpiece with a message for every person on the face of the earth.  Jason delivers a love massage for the world, without pointing fingers, without acrimony, without sarcasm, but with carefully crafted encouragement and devoted singularity.  Whether the message sounds &quot;personal&quot; (The Woman I Love) or altruistically &quot;social consciousness&quot; (I Won't Give Up/The World As I See It), Jason has brought beauty and passion to a medium which has been reeling from dark and inglorious &quot;message music&quot; for far too long.  Then there is the astounding expressiveness of his band!  Living In The Moment, I Won't Give Up, 5/6, In Your Hands, and The World As I See It, all have some of the best instrumentation I have heard in decades, breath-taking sound.  As with Sting, Jason has an uncanny ability to match the lyrics to the music in a perfect fusion whereby the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts.  THIS then, is the true sign of genius.<br /><br />A word about the engineering.  All of Jason's albums have top-notch sound engineering, but the last three albums, Sing Dance Steal, Beautiful Mess, and Love Is, all three have damn-near High Definition acoustics that envelope the listener, do not call into question the abilities of your speakers low end, and keep the highs from approaching a dog whistle.

I don't know what HE was listening to, but it sure wasn't Love Is A Four Letter Word.  Obviously this guy a curmudgeon, something I am desperately trying to avoid as I age.  As I write this, North Korea is rattling the nuclear sabre at us, there are wars all over the map, Western Civilization is going bankrupt (economically and spiritually), a new Pope is being vetted, and The Bachelor finale is the highest rated television program this month.  So what does Mr. Jon Caramanica want to listen to?  Either he is tone deaf, has no musical talent appreciation (taste), or he has no soul.<br /><br />If you have a soul, or if you have soul, or if you like jeans and t-shirt and going barefoot in the grass, if you like colors, rhymes, hobbits, puppies and kittens, the laughter of children, impressionist art, coffee and cookies, cuddling with your significant other and watching the Friday night creature features, well then you will certainly like Love Is A Four Letter Word, because you are, after all, ...human!uncanny ability to match the lyrics to the music in a perfect fusion whereby the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts.  THIS then, is the true sign of genius.<br /><br />A word about the engineering.  All of Jason's albums have top-notch sound engineering, but the last three albums, Sing Dance Steal, Beautiful Mess, and Love Is, all three have damn-near High Definition acoustics that envelope the listener, do not call into question the abilities of your speakers low end, and keep the highs from approaching a dog whistle.

B005723JSQ|5.0|this is a great book. i laughed out loud a number of times. good read. i wish there were a sequel. really liked the characters.
B00AZ3027I|5.0|my five year old son delights at the imagination of this story. he enjoys the mystery, adventure and comfort of the happy ending as well. and the possibilities that the future offers.
0394818237|5.0|A favorite of my son, the world of Busy Town is now his son and daughter's favorite learning world. The book is large and every page is packed with things to point at and talk about. At 2 and 3 they don't really care about stories but there are short stories on each page. They are super careful with the book and enjoy pouring over it and discovering new things. A book that will grow with them.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|I guess I considered myself somewhat of a feminist before I read this book( despite liking to shave my legs and armpits) but when Moran explains feminism I realize that this sounds very much like everything I believe in. Good book!
B004EBT5CU|1.0|AWFUL album! One awful song after another with an off-key sounding voice. Straight to the trash can goes that one!
B000FF8U9S|5.0|The album is fantastic ! Not only was the price just right, but, the quality of the Vinyl is superb! I have another original copy, from around 1976 wore that out, bought a replacement copy. When I was in the market for an original I had no idea that I would find a seller that would do me SO RIGHT. Insert book was intact. The inner sleeve didn't  have so much as a crease! Thank you
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|awesome! fast shipping!!! would recommend buying form here! great service~! I had no issues and my package arrived ahead of schedule and you just can't beat that!
B001T6PXFG|5.0|At a time when morality has become debatable this film is a clear affirmation that it is not. It is never wrong to do the right thing. Living with Christian integrity has never been easy, but when it is the examples of  truth in action is profoundly convincing.
1416550534|5.0|This is the first time I have ever read anything by Kate Morton.  The book takes you back to an earlier time in the main character's life.  Filled with unexpected twists and turns, you learn a long kept secret and just don't want the story to end.  I highly recommend this book.  Great read!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is really good. It is very realistic looking and I love the lively sounds as well. Would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I could not put this book down and every time I give someone flowers in the future, I will consult this book first!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love, love love, my pinterest account! This app is good because it does not change the format too much, and I can easily access my pins. Since I am an artist, I can look other artist's work. I look at it frequently and always come away inspired..:)
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Thought it was pretty good, but much like a Hallmark story.  A bit too schmaltzy;  Plot has been overused.  Would recommend it as a quick read for the beach.
055338466X|5.0|the book made it on time,and in a very good condition.  definitely worth it. great book, couldn't drop it till I finished it.
B0086700CM|5.0|One of the best games I have added to my Kindle in the 2 years I've had it. So fun!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Didn't want it to end.  Fast read.<br /><br />Can't wait for movie to come out.<br /><br />The best of the 3 books.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I gave it four stars because I couldn't get very far. My grand son loves it and of course is good at it. I think it is comprobable to some of the other tablet games from competitors.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|Got this for our little guy who's just shy of his 7 month birthday - he likes it just fine, AS LONG AS WE DON'T TURN IT ON!!! Then it scares the bejesus out of him and he just cries. Just be warned, if your baby isn't too keen on noisy toys, this thing whistles and sings and \\"boing\\"s loudly, and it speeds up with each repetition. Hopefully he'll warm up to it with time, if not we may end up donating it to his daycare, or just enjoying it with no sound. :)
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Jodi Picoult captures the essence of teen years and 2 teens so entertwined by their parents and proximity of their homes that a sibling relationship cannot easily transiton into a lasting love relationship for both the teens involved.  The parents promote the continuance without thought to the stress on the one party who cannot think of the other teen except as a sibling.  The stress of parental expectations leads to drastic results.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|My personal favorite film for 2012, so I couldn't wait to pick up up! The added digital copy was a wonderful bonus. Frankly, I don't use digital gagets, so I shared the digital copy with a friend. Two movies for the price of one. Not a bad deal! Don't forget to watch the end credits on this one! They did a great job with casting! Most of the cast looks identical to the actual people the move was based on...
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the best kindle game I ever, and I mean EVER, played. The graphics are life like, the combat is brutal, and the story is awesome. I strongly recommend this!
0545265355|5.0|Thought this was a teen or even pre-teen series until a 60 year old male co-worker told me that he loved it! Okay, so I had to check it out. Yes, I coudn't put them down! I decided to buy the series to share with my son, and almost bought them through his school Scholastic Book Fair. Then I saw these on Amazon at a cheaper price. Highly recommend!
B0018AM1YY|5.0|With 16 of Neil's biggest hits from the early part of his spectacular and  prolific career, this album, GREATEST HITS can't possibly disappoint unless one is looking for a song rarely heard from that era.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Get little complicated for my son when you move to higher level. But it keeps you thinking. I would recommend it.
B00BJZJXWG|5.0|I think this album is very well executed and has something for everyone - a little funk, a little R&B, dream pop, etc but most of all this is some serious panty-droppin' music. It is hypnotizing. I look forward to future works by these guys.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|To start with the controls are bad, in attempts to move my character I would end up going the wrong way or nowhere at all.  And the whole point of the game was to run around collecting posters while being chased by a guy who isn't really chasing you.  I played for about 10 min hoping it would get better, but it didn't, so I uninstalled it.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A must read if you want to succeed in network marketing. It is great for personal development and leadership building.
0385536828|3.0|I had expected more from this book that was highly recommended by Newsweek.  I give credit to the surprise ending, which caught me pleasantly off guard
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book.  I saw Eben on Oprah's Super Soul Sunday and immediately got online and ordered the book.  I enjoyed reading every page and found the medical journey mixed with the spiritual journey to be compelling.  Buy it, read it and enjoy!!
B005J2UM9S|4.0|The movie was one of the better recent horror movies.<br /><br />SemiSPOILER<br />***<br />The only discrepancy I really have is how the tapes are found at the end.<br />***<br /><br />Also, I tend to find amazon prime's quality to be relatively poor when your internet is not superb, so I would recommend finding this movie elsewhere if you don't want to wait for it to load.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|My granddaughter asked me to read this with her after I had cautioned her about reading it at all. However, she was way ahead of me! We did see the movie together. Then, I read the first book. It's one of those &#34;can't-put-it-down&#34; kind of books. Meghan had told me the heroine's participation in violence was for good ... so far, Katniss is a hero for our young people. Sure hope she doesn't disappoint me in the remaining two books ...
B000067QMD|5.0|This makes it so easy when we travel. We can store the water in here and just add the formula when he's ready to eat.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm so happy I do not have to buy a calculator because. last week I was going to buy one for my daughter and son hw because there in the same class Chloe;drake are in 4# grade need help with it so when I went there at the store it cost 9.00 for a calculator omg I was mad until I found one thx amazon Andrea;16 is in high school ;my other son jay;Is in 3#grade I got a baby she 5 months I named her Sara she so small thx again!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Good story and an easy read.  I was able to read it in one day. It gives insight into a life living with depression.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love all the characters in this show! Sheldon's facial expressions crack me up! I look forward to watching this every week.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had been told I would like this but was reluctant because of the typical stereotypes put into such shows.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was originally an Israeli series about a returning POW.  That emphasis on the missing soldier Brody (Damian Lewis) returning after eight years was a set up for an American television series.  Add in Carrie (Claire Danes), a CIA officer pulled back to Langley to be an analyst for going \\"too far\\" in Baghdad trying to protect a 'burned' source who told her al Qaeda had turned an American.  That is the very beginning to get you assuming how things might go from the very beginning.  If that was all this series was it would be good for two maybe three hours of viewing.<br /><br />This series is so much more.  The soldier must deal with a family that believed he had died and moved on including a son who can't remember his father because he was an infant when the soldier left.  He also has to deal with his life in \\"captivity\\" and that he was captured with his sniper team mate, who was beaten to death, for whom he dug a grave for and saw buried.  The disconnect of what he has experienced effects how he can deal with freedom.  His torment leads him to lash out, whether fairly or not, at those he comes into contact with.<br /><br />Carrie on the other hand has been so wronged by the Agency that she will do anything to prove them wrong and now she has a chance to prove that she was right all along.  She of course ignores her mentor's advice and breaks the law in her pursuit coming up with a clue.  Up until here it is kind of stereotypical plot, but then when that clue doesn't lead to more and eventually pans out, she is fixated on Brody.  And of course if there is a sleeper terrorist then there is even that much more conflict for the series that could have been a two hour movie.<br /><br />This series however was just starting with this much.  Brody's family, the wife of his dead sniper mate, and old friends wouldn't have made it into a movie to cut time off of it.  Carrie's family and her condition wouldn't have made it into a movie either, extraneous subplots consuming too much time in a hunt / countdown thriller.  This series is made by including characters with believably motivated plotlines of their own.  It tries to show how the CIA operates (as well as anything in Hollywood or television can) rarely going into stereotypes.<br /><br />I could go into all the details, which make this a brilliant series, but I don't want to ruin it and I will probably find more as I watch it again.  Go out and get it.  You will find out that it is worth every cent and more for the hours of smart entertainment (and thought provoking) that it gives you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best season yet! Zombie slaying at it's best with a little bit of love mixed in the prison staying bunch! Love Rick, Daryl and Carl!
B0043VDIAG|3.0|Not the best book I've read but kept me entertained all the same! Great for something to read by the pool on holiday!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game os pretty fun. I play it when I get bored on class. (college) . . . . .
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Plenty of fun. It may seem hard at first to upgrade, but with a little work or a few tries, you can be traveling further than you thought the game would take you. It's great for something quick, challenging but simple enough for a kid also.
0307730697|5.0|Amazing Book. Im really not a big reader and I couldn't put this down so for me to say that is amazing. This book really makes you think about whats important in life and what it means to have honor, dignity and love in your life. I hope my kids one day read this and decide to make changes in there lives to better them and everyone around them. What a true warrior he was and the kind of guy we should all look up too. God bless him and his family..
B008M87GJK|5.0|The BBC News is an easy way to stay on top of word events. The ease of reading stories in a kindle format is a nice feature.
B00447G2MK|5.0|A day to remember is a great band. They have their own sound, and enjoyable music. This CD has many of my favorites, and many of their top songs. A Day To Remember's \\"What separates me from you\\" album, is defiantly A top choice, especially if you are fans of Of Mice and Men, All Time Low, Sleeping with Sirens,and many other bands that are alike. This CD never disappoints.
B004GYY714|5.0|I really like this radio player, I have access to hundreds of great stations and the streaming function is really easy to use.
1594488886|5.0|I haven't finished reading it yet but so far it is what I expected it to be after reading The Kiterunner.  Very insightful.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|An interesting premise written fairly well. And once it's over you get two more chunks of aftermath, something not usually done.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am breaking my self-imposed rule against giving 5 stars to a book I haven't read at least twice. This is the best science-y science fiction book I have read in ages!  There is so much science and engineering information in this book.  Every predicament and every solution are plausible and well explained.  (The only thing that remotely strained credibility was how many predicaments there are.  But how else does one get a novel-length book?)  How does Mark Watley wind up stranded alone on Mars, with no way to contact Earth?  Good question, with a good answer.  What will he eat?  What will he drink?  What will he breathe? Good questions, with good answers.  Will he get home to Earth? How? Questions that remain right up to the very end.<br /><br />But that's not all that makes this book so enjoyable.  Even without another human to interact with, Watney is a wonderfully funny and engaging character.  I will miss spending time with him.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it would be that I wish Andy Weir had kept the language a little cleaner, so that teachers could unreservedly recommend this to middle school-aged kids.  They could get so much from this book.  (Yes, I know the kids wouldn't be too shocked or put off by the occasional F-bomb, but teachers have to be careful about their recommendations.)<br /><br />If you are a SCIENCE fiction fan, do yourself a favor and read this book immediately.  And then join me in waiting breathlessly for Weir's next book.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Being a &#34;damn dirty liberal&#34; I found myself siding with the thieves who seemingly effortlessly stole thousands from the rich people.<br /><br />Then the stuff gets serious. I enjoyed it enough to buy the 2nd one and will likely get the next after that.
1616550414|5.0|The person who received it was very excited with the present and enjoyed the quality. One of his favorite items.
1416589473|4.0|I started playing Guild Wars 2 and was interested in the storylines that were used. This book is a fun addition to the gameplay and explained several things to me (I did not play the original Guild Wars game). Look, its not Tolkien, but its a nice story that fleshes out some of the key players that you meet in the game and solidifies the &#34;history&#34; of the GW world.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have lost pounds, inches, and stress - and I have gained my freedom! I thought it was normal to run to the bathroom after every meal - especially after eating cereal in the morning, a sandwich with &#34;healthy&#34; whole-wheat bread for lunch, and whole-wheat pasta for dinner. I love going on  long walks and trail hikes, but was always afraid to get too far away from a toilet. Now, I can go on 10-mile jaunts, long car rides, etc. and never think twice! Thank you, Dr. Davis -  you gave me my life back - I am now totally wheat-free!!
0345803507|5.0|Had to purchase since the library was always a wait list.  I just had to finish the trilogy and wanted it to never end.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Jiro is a very dedicated man to his craft. He eared a three star Michelin rating.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Just watch this documentary and you'll find out!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is another version of some collaborative efforts between David Foster and Andrea.  The work they perform together is phenominal and, I enjoy it totally.
B002Z7FWBI|4.0|Lots of violence and Eastwood one liners. What I expect when I watch any of the Dirty Harry collection. I still like the original best.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is an amazing book. Although this isn't my favorite book, it is definitely one of them. The reason it isn't my favorite book is that it ends too abruptly. This is still an awesome book even with that.
B004UID2LC|2.0|it is ok but in my option I like play tube better this app you only have lesson to the song once and then you can already listen to it without wifi
1576875776|5.0|Vivian Maier was an amateur photographer who spent most of her life working as a nanny in Chicago, and her archive of over 100,000 photographs only began to be fully appreciated after her death in 2009. She travelled worldwide but most of her photos are inevitably of Chicago street scenes. Many of her subjects stare directly into the camera, so clearly Maier spoke to the people and got their permission to take their portraits. Even so, they look as natural as her candid shots, while her work also captures the energy of Chicago, with a great eye for composition.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Great little lesson here but way over the head of a three year old.  She did like the dragon and the &#34;dress&#34; but not old enough to appreciate the lesson.
B000002B49|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old son to use as &#34;calming music&#34;. Since he has Autism, it's hard for him to calm himself after he gets upset. This CD is perfect, it has rich, complex sounds and a wonderful cultural beat that my son finds enthralling. Definitely worth getting!
B008EKOO46|5.0|Great summary of things we probably knew from other reading but full of wonderful anecdotal insights and Diamond offers a useful way of looking at our own society.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This is a fun movie even if you don't know all the games.  If you do know the games it makes it funnier.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This is a totally awesome CD. I can play this over and over and not get tired of listening. There are so many hidden facets to Hendrix's riffs that I listen and hear new nuances each time. I HIGHLY recommend this CD for any Hendrix fan. Your collection is NOT COMPLETE with this missing!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Both my son (7) and myself enjoy this game.  We originally played Riptide by same developers.  The graphics were really good so we downloaded beach buggy blitz a few days later.  no disappointments here.  easy concept...collect coins to upgrade your car and drivers.  the course constantly changes so it keeps you guessing.  two thumbs up!!
B008HK3XKO|2.0|Probably my fault.  I ordered what I thought was the correct one for our Kindle Fire's.  They were too big for our's to fit into.  Will be reordering the correct one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because every day I have nothing to do so I go on this kindle fire and play temple run two. It gives me something to look forward to every day so my advice to you is to play this game!!!!!!! It's flipping awsom!!!!!!!!!
B004J4XGN6|3.0|worthy to reading.<br /><br />The concept is very easy to understand. The point is how to carry out. However, the book gives less contents on howto.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Listen, not everyone is going to like this book. It may make some people uncomfortable either with themselves or their environment. Some people may claim that this book is all about making women feel they haven't pushed far enough into board rooms or into C-Suites. I have read this book, and as a highly successful solo-business owner that ditched corporate to rise higher, it **really** hit home. Not every woman WANTS to run a company (big or small) or even work outside her home, but every woman needs to have the right to be a leader in every capacity she wants. The book's message above all else is that no matter your background, education, upbringing or position of power in the workplace or your family is that as women we NEED to know that any choice we make will be met with the same enthusiasm and respect that our men counterparts enjoy.<br /><br />There was a perfect mix of research data, personal / professional stories from Ms. Sandberg, and other professional women's stories at all levels of leadership. While the author is in a much different professional position than I am, I still found the content very relatable as I too identify as a 'geek' that has ignored (or been naive to) the obstacles in my way - either externally or by my own doing. I also appreciate her request that men also read the book to understand the struggles that modern women face everyday that, even with the best of intentions, men often don't recognize. Men and women are not the same, she as well as I admit this, but in the workplace and the world the idea that each person be allowed to work and lead to their best capacity and contribute EQUALLY to our environment.<br /><br />I bought this on Kindle so I could start reading it immediately, but I will go back and purchase the hardcover because I see myself making a lot of dog-eared pages and notes in the margins - and then passing it along to other women in my network to act as a catalyst and inspiration to all who read it.<br /><br />- Lynette Young (Owner, Purple Stipe Productions   Founder, Women of Google+   Author,[...])te Young (Owner, Purple Stipe Productions   Founder, Women of Google+   Author,[...])

B004SIP7AS|5.0|If you have not experienced J. Austen, afraid of the old English, watch this movie then read the book. You will be hooked! Read all her books and you will be taken to a world of romance as only this lady wrote. This is what romance should be!
B0016BP0PW|4.0|I got it as a free download for buying the bluray. It allowed me to instantly watch the film even though I was waiting for it to be delivered. Scored me huge brownie points with my GF.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Totally true to the saga. Very well done really tells you what the beginning of the story is. . This is truly a love story in the beginning you learn how they met and why he mean so much to her a specially why she means so much to him
B000059T1V|5.0|This is great live Muddy Waters. I have been a live Muddy fan since I heard &#34;Long Distance Call&#34; on the &#34;Fathers and Sons&#34; album. No one does Muddy better than Muddy.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|My kids introduced me to this group. I love their music, even if I am an old woman! Great lyrics. Meaningful.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Such an addicting show.  Love the characters, don't want it to end.  Wish I understood how this disease started in the first place.  How long was Rick in the hospital, a month?  Why didn't the walkers find him in the room. He wasn't locked in
B0067AC5KA|5.0|You can't put it down once you start to read. A very interesting and exciting drama. Great characters that keep you on the edge of anticipation for what will happen next.
0670026603|5.0|It was on a rainy morning in the central London traffic that the life of a vital, charismatic, and handsome man was changed forever. A road accident had permanently damaged Will Traynor's spinal cord and reduced him on a wheelchair: once a lover of extreme sports and a powerful businessman, Will is now quadriplegic, he has lost forever the use of his legs and has a very limited use of hands and arms. Not only does he need to be constantly assisted and monitored by medical staff; his mental welfare is compromised as well and, after a failed suicide attempt, his parents decide to hire a caregiver/companion who might help him and encourage him to adapt to his new circumstances.<br />\\"[...] his condition [is] not just a matter of being stuck in that chair, of the loss of physical freedom, but a never-ending  litany of indignities and health problems, of risks and discomforts.\\"<br /><br />Will's paralysis is not a reversible condition; the only thing doctors can do for him  is trying to reduce his pain, stop him from atrophying and keep his physical condition up, but there is nothing that therapy can do to lift his spirit. Louisa Clark, just an ordinary girl living an ordinary life and only bread-winner in her family, is in desperate need to find a new job. While seeking for new opportunities, a well-paid and temporary position as a caregiver for a disabled man seems to be her only option, and although she believes to be inadequate for the job because of her lack of professional skills, she appears to have the right mental attitude to deal with the dejected and disabled Will Traynor. Lou may not be refined or highly educated, she doesn't have fancy hobbies or trips abroad to show off on her resume, she doesn't belong in Will's high society world, but she is attentive and emphatic, cheerful and chatty. With  her extravagant clothes and snappy tongue she amuses Will to no end, bringing in his otherwise grey and sterile life a blast of color and warm sweetness. With her ability to tune into Will's needs and emotions, not only Lou succeeds in tearing down the walls of sarcasm, anger and frustration he has erected around himself after the accident; she even convinces him to allow himself to find a reason to live through experiences that might generate happiness and contentment. Against all expectations, Will and Lou will find themselves intensely connected and  drawn to each other by an irresistible chemistry, more powerful than all the challenges and limitations imposed by his physical disability. But for a man who used to be at the top of his game, and now completely powerless, vulnerable, and unable to do a single thing for himself, even love may not be enough to steer his mind from an heartbreaking decision.<br /><br />I do not usually lose my composure when I read a tear jerker novel, but ME BEFORE YOU by acclaimed author Jojo Moyes absolutely stunned me. It reduced me to an emotional wreck like very few books have been able to do in a long time, my emotions and reactions to a delicate matter such as voluntary euthanasia still raw days after the last page was turned. What the romantic cover artwork and upbeat book jacket blurb deceivingly tend to present as a modern fairy-tale turned out to be a much more complicated and profoundly ethical debate on the moral issues and legal legitimacy of  the personal right to death for people who suffer from debilitating conditions and terminal illnesses.

Against all expectations, Will and Lou will find themselves intensely connected and  drawn to each other by an irresistible chemistry, more powerful than all the challenges and limitations imposed by his physical disability.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is a must for platform lovers.It has multiple things to buy for no real money,but in game currency.I think you should get it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. It reminded me of my childhood, and I will read this book again I'm sure. Great read!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|News feeds don't load, cannot open comments most of the time without shutting the app down and restarting it. These issues need to be fixed.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie may have had a good lesson to be told,  but the language, drinking and pot smoking was way over the top and using a talking teddy bear to portray this was in very bad taste.  This is not a film that I would think Mark Wahlberg would have done.
B00942X8PY|5.0|Love Noodlecake puzzles.....create some more! They are challenging, colorful, and keep my old brain in shape! I especially like the shapes and colors on Huebrix.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is my first time rating an album, I had to give some support to Macklemore.  It is a great album from start to finish!
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This reminds me of a game I used to play on my brother's gameboy years ago. I cannot remember the game as my brother was not always lenient with the lending as it was one of the newer edition models, but that is all besides the point. Me and my tangents!<br /><br />Anyway, this is actually a a really good game. This is a neat puzzle game where you sort pipes in order deliver a fluid to the right place. It has a pretty good progression in difficulty, but if puzzles are your standard fare it might be on the easy side. Nevertheless, this app works well on both my Samsung S3 and First generation Kindle Fire. I do wish, however, that there were more levels included in this game.<br /><br />Permissions: There are none! I know that many will be ecstatic with that fact, especially given some of the most recent FAOTD. But I appreciate the fact that I do not need to report anything to some social media medium such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. I enjoy it when I can just play a game.<br /><br />This is an app that is a great FAOTD, but well worth the 99 cent fee on the regular.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Mr. Thomas Anderson is crazy gifted. His films are so beautiful and majestic and natural. The problem is that he doesn't like you. He doesn't like humans. He's way too accurate in his criticism. He is being straight-up with you and it hurts. He wants to hurt you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the fact that I can store things electronically. I am a very visual person so this is perfect for me to &#34;scrapbook&#34; online.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Ben Affleck is a source of optimism. I don't know the guy, but he's got a humorous quirk about his work that endears you to his plight. He takes this optimism and artfully injects it into the film and the film's main character. While there was plenty of tense and sweaty 70's polyester, I never really thought it would end badly.
B001HN69AY|5.0|Everything I had heard about this movie was great, but until I saw it I had no idea how great it was.  It was a great display of brotherhood and kinsmenship how these actors came in and totally filled in for Heath Ledger.  This film is moving if for no other reason than that.  Loved it!

B003Y5H4SO|5.0|The plot of this movie was pretty forward. You had to figure out who was the devil, but twist at the end was great and unexpected.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Jimi Hendrix can be described as a musician who only appears 'once in a lifetime.'  43 years have elapsed since Hendrix's untimely passing at the age of 27-years old, but generations old and new continue to be compelled by the icon. \\"Purple Haze\\", in particular, remains a popular fixture retaining its place in pop culture. Columbia Records likely easily anticipated the potential  success of a compilation of unreleased recordings, particularly one the caliber of the solid [[ASIN:B00AA0TZTW People, Hell & Angels]].  Those who grew up with Hendrix will relive his genius in a new way while those less familiar will be educated in 60s rock, laden with blues, soul, and psychedelia.<br /><br />\\"Earth Blues\\" appears in stripped form, featuring Hendrix (vocals, guitar), Billy Cox (bass, backing vocal), and Buddy Miles (drums, backing vocal). Uncrowded and very natural sounding, Hendrix vocals are soulful in quasi-vocalized/spoken form while his guitar riffs always shine through the production.  \\"Earth Blues\\" initiates things impressively, giving way for \\"Somewhere\\", another stripped, but brilliant number with guitarist Stephen Stills on bass. Hendrix's playing here in particular is characterized by its raucous, noisy nature and use of the wah wah effect.  Buddy Miles anchors things down on drums, providing some truly electrifying, forward-propelling runs.  \\"Hear My Train A Coming\\"  appears as take three, and provides the third straight exceptional unreleased track. Billy Cox's looping bass line throughout anchors down the vamp in which Hendrix showcases incredible guitar grit and rawness.<br /><br />\\"Bleeding Heart\\" capitalizes on a funk-rock sound steeped in blues. \\"Let Me Move You\\", expands the instrumentation to include Lonnie Youngblood (saxophone and vocal), John Winfield (organ), and an unknown percussionist.  Including influences of funk and soul blended with psychedelic rock, \\"Let Me Move You\\" latches from the first listen.  \\"Izabella\\" adds a rhythm guitarist (Larry Lee) to the mix. Lee's rhythmic contributions complement Hendrix's more dominating, bluesy lead.  The same expanded lineup returns for instrumental number \\"Easy Blues\\".  Cox's bass line is styled much like a walking bass line in jazz/blues, but with some deviations.<br /><br />Two noteworthy numbers follow in \\"Crash Landing\\" and \\"Inside Out\\". \\"Crash Landing\\", proclaimed by the liner notes to be an early incarnation of Hendrix's \\"Freedom\\",  adds an unknown organist as well as drummer Rocky Isaac (Cherry People).  The results are magnificent, characterized by Cox's animated buttressing bass lines, Isaac's heavy hi-hat reliant drumming, and Hendrix's playful vocals and  his funky guitar comping (rhythm) and soloing (lead). \\"Inside Out\\" proves to be even more important. Hendrix handles both guitar and bass duties, overdubbing the bass part after initially recording  his guitar with drummer Mitch Mitchell.  Although an organist graces many cuts, Hendrix takes the task on himself,  brilliantly amplifying his guitar through a Leslie speaker.  Genius at its best.<br /><br />\\"Hey Gypsy Boy\\", issued as take eight, returns to a trio setting, featuring Hendrix on guitar/vocal, an unknown bassist, and Miles on drums.  \\"Mojo Man\\" contrasts, expanding in full fruition featuring piano, horns, and percussion.  Hendrix sticks to guitar-playing here, with Albert Allen leading the charge on vocals.  The results are a compelling fusion of rock and soul.  Closing cut \\"Villanova Junction Blues\\" closes much like the effort began - the trio formed by Hendrix, Cox and Miles.  Via the liner notes, this version of \\"Villanova Junction Blues\\" appeared before the Woodstock version.<br /><br />Overall [[ASIN:B00AA0TZTW People, Hell & Angels]] provides Hendrix fans and music lovers another quality album.  These unreleased takes/recordings very much epitomize the gone-too-soon genius that Jimi Hendrix was.  Furthermore, there is a timelessness exhibited on People, Hell & Angels that many recordings by modern artists will never experience, period.  It may not be the established classic of Hendrix's best known work(s), but this is a special album by a very, VERY special musician.y modern artists will never experience, period.  It may not be the established classic of Hendrix's best known work(s), but this is a special album by a very, VERY special musician.
B005HSL626|3.0|Not one I play often. I prefer word games or games I can play with other people. The graphics and colors are great though.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|this was a very good book but some sentences  just didnt make sense but it was very exciting to know what happend next
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am amazed with this app. You can read it or apply the audio and have it read to you. If you go a couple days without using it, a reminder comes on to get you going again. This is truly a great app.
0345803485|5.0|Okay I hate reading and one of my goals this year was to read a full book any book. I heard a lot of talk about this book and I really liked it. I read a lot of bad reviews on this book which was sad to me. Mainly because this is just a book. A book to kind of just lose yourself in. Yes, theres a lot of sex in it which i heard a lot of complaints about... Honestly what did you expect? I got lost in it and really liked it. Shockingly, I finished it in a week and ordered the other two....
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I Couldn't put it down. You get so involved with the characters. I Felt like I was in the story.
B0018QPPXW|5.0|This is a great movie. No matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old. The ultimate in teenage boy's fantasies, with plenty of action, comedy, and lust. Watch it!
B007Y36K46|4.0|This is a fun afternoon fantasy/adventure flick, based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs character who first appeared in 1917 or so. I became a fan of Burroughs fiction in my early teens [about 45 years ago] and still enjoy going back to read his stories once in a while and tread the ochre plains of Barsoom [Mars] with Princess Dejah Thoris and John Carter and the huge supporting cast of characters that roves the Burroughs version of Mars. This movie has lots of action, and the characters are well portrayed, given that everything we know about them has to be written into a script and pushed out through a movie [or computer] screen. The green Martians—Tharks—don't look much like I imagined them, and Woola the faithful calot is a bit cartoony, but overall I think the filmmakers did a great job of capturing the essence of Burroughs' spectacularly complex imaginary world and presenting it in a way that even those unfamiliar with the source material will find engaging. I hope that despite the lackluster critical response and mismanaged marketing, this becomes a full franchise and works through the series, slowly, to allow viewers to get to know the characters as they did with the Lord of the Rings movies. And I equally hope that if you found this movie at all worthwhile that you will read the source material—Burrough's stories are fantastic in the best possible sense of the word. I watched it on the Amazon streaming site and now wish I'd gone to see it on the big screen.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a good read.  I didn't want to put it down because I was dying to see why she ran away from her husband. Nicholas Sparks writes the best love stories.  I heard the movie is great also, can't wait to aee
B0031RDV0A|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read on evolution written for layman. He clarifies the basic ideas behind the evolution so clearlly. It really seems evolution is the geatest show on earth.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|A disturbing view of damaged people told by actors of great ability.  It's parallels to Scientology made it interesting without being a key element of the film.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book kept me interested the whole time. The plot kept twisting and turning.<br />I just didn't like the ending, but then again I barely like the ending of books and movies and tv shows because I want them to all end happy and they just don't always.
0393342212|5.0|I am a parent coach, and sibling issues come up quite frequently in my practice.  This book is a wonderful resource, quick and easy to read, but full of concrete examples of specific things to say to your kids.  I think most parenting books are too heavy on theory and too light on practicality, but this is a good blend of both.
1574214276|5.0|Succinct yet comprehensive introduction.  I really liked the format of the book: design samples listed alphabetically with great photos and easy to follow instructions.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It is a lot  of fun to play I was told there is more angry birds to download will be looking for them
0743289692|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it was informative and engaging. The book truly made me &#34;think&#34; about my own Christian faith and all &#34;religions&#34;.  My heart broke for her childhood tramas and I found myself cheering for her as she slowly transitioned herself into her new life in Holland.  She was so strong and courageous to step out of her background and make that change for herself and others.  I could certainly understand how she became an athiest but I pray her heart will change back toward God as she lives out her life in freedom to choose her God.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|A good job of keeping the idea of the game but changing it up. The only issue is how long it takes to load each little game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was an excellent read.I also saw the movie.I have read all of his books and loved every one of them.I. hope he has another one come out soon.<br />  Sincerely,Arlene LeMire
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|had a good time with the app. good storyline. great graphics. loved the find objects concept.want. more levels. great pass time. I recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows. I don't have cable anymore, so I am really glad that I can get this season on Amazon!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My granddaughter asked for the book and the movie. Both are very good. The whole family enjoyed this heartwarming movie!
B008133MDK|5.0|After watching the pilot of this show, I knew I was hooked. Having been an avid Holmes for a while, I was afraid I would be disappointed; however, I found this show to be delightful, and I cannot wait for the next season to be filmed and released.
B002VWNIAY|4.0|Great movie I enjoyed I just wish it was in color but unforgetable, took me back in time when I was younger.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this wonderfully scripted movie. Hats off to Helen Hunt for taking the risks in making this movie. Also a great portrayal of a taboo subject but one very familiar to a handicapped person.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|far better than the original (not that it was bad) movie - I loved the two Colin & Kate chasing.  This is a moment by moment enjoyable action movie.  Watch it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|My heart ached for the girl in this story. I can't imagine growing up like this. It's amazing how the flowers helped her. This was a great story and I couldn't put it down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a must see from start to finish. The characters, house, and time in history are beautifully woven into stories we all can relate to.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Thought this was a chick book but found out otherwise. I loved how the author developed the two main characters, Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. Plus a happy ending!
B004JHYRAE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The title is spot-on and I see why they call this book &#34;the bible&#34; to the subject at hand. It really helps one identify, and even better, be proud of who they are.  I personally preferred another book called Opening Up, but this is still an excellent read and cannot see anybody reading one book without reading the other.<br /><br />I did think the book is a tad too aggressive to being okay with this lifestyle that humanity is still evolving towards slowly over time. But once somebody becomes a seasoned Slut, I could only imagine the book is written just correct as it is.  Example being, I regretted my fiancee grabbing this book to read first before Opening Up. I read both, I would suggest reading Opening Up first, then this book.<br /><br />Many things can be applied to other matters in life that was mentioned in this book.  This book has given me tools I required to move forward with my life and the information came at the exact proper time that I needed to help us with our issues as we have been taking about this for a least five years prior. With the information, we could FINALLY move forward and have never looked back with regret.  Our intimate lives have never been better and this book has helped us form a stronger bond than we ever had before.<br /><br />I wish I could only thank the Authors directly myself and thank them for others who could not be able to do so either. Please do not jump into things; take your time, read this book a few times if need be. I could have never made it through and break my mold without the help of this book.  The person I have always been has been waiting to come out, the person I have always been and was not yet too aware of it, this book helped inspire us to be ourselves.<br /><br />May it also help you on your path you have chosen for yourself.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|You need to be a baseball fan to appreciate this book. Just look at the A's success this past year as validation of Billy Beane's player evaluation theories.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Kept my interest throughout the whole movie. Great Action Scenes. Lots of good dialogue and music. I wish I had time to watch it a second time!
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Fun, light movie that's great to watch with the kids or other adults and it was free with Prime! I watched it in my new Roku.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Not much to say. A very good book that takes you to another time and place. You feel you know the characters. Happy, sad and joyful. A real treat to read. Love to see this become a movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Great story and fun for gamers. I didn't recognize some of the games but it was entertaining as an adult. Nice movie to watch with your family.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Love this show - best show ever!  I was happy to be able to purchase certain episodes only.  Specifically because there were only a few that I hadn't watched.
0307352153|5.0|I've always kind of wondered where I fit in the grand scheme of things, since I've never really been the outgoing type, nor are most of the people I know (or so I feel, anyway). Instead I've just kind of faked my way through social interaction until I really know someone. Going through the motions was a constant but tiring ritual. I was far more of a listener than a talker, and I always felt more comfortable revealing and expressing myself through writing than speaking.<br /><br />This book explained all of that, how my brain works and how I interact with myself and with others, and compared and contrasted that with people who are more extroverted. It put into words a lot of the ideas I had about myself that I couldn't put together myself. I found myself constantly saying \\"ohhh that's so me,\\" I think more than any other book I've ever read. I'm doing a terrible job of explaining how awesome this book is, but I think it's great. I'd recommend it to everyone, not just introverts, since I think it can help both introverts and extroverts understand each other and the details of the introvert personality. Quiet covers a lot of things: how introverts interact with new people; how they act in social situations; relationships; work; amongst other introverts; by themselves; school... all kinds of things.<br /><br />Quiet is the only the only book I've ever written in (I feel that books are sacred, and have the same attitude of 'leave it better than you found it' that I do towards camping), and I did it not only for myself (this may sound weird) but I hope someday that I'll find a nice woman who will be interested in that kind of thing and can read my copy and see what I've highlighted and the copious notes I've written about myself so she can get a better idea of who I think I am and how I see myself. If spilling myself onto the pages of this book for myself and someone else, sacrificing otherwise rock solid ethics in the process, doesn't tell you how important this book isto me and hopefully others, then I'm not sure anything will.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie from beginning to end, it's a great period piece as well as a great character based movie. Bummer that Affleck didn't even get nominated from best director.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Like the &#34;Fight Club&#34;, this trash is appealing to young readers who idolize criminal and immoral ideas as their way to rebel against<br />authority and think that this would increase their appeal to peers by being &#34;tough&#34; instead of consideration, respect and and rational, responsible thinking.  As a currupt Rome fell to barbarians, America will fall also.
B00942X8PY|3.0|Fun, needs instruction key to help oldies catch on quicker and to be able to meet the assigned time requirements for scpromg
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A real morality play, begging a number of elemental questions.  Explores humanity and lack thereof in an effective and entertaining way.  There is a real investment in the characters on the part of the viewer.
1846573785|1.0|First, I'd like to review the audio itself, not the quality of the book. This is the first audiobook I've listened to, so I don't have a broad range of experience with various readers. All I do know is that the girl reading this book is HORRIBLY IRRITATING. Is a decent set of acting skills a job requirement of an audiobook reader? I'm guessing not, because this girl's poor emotional expression drove me up a wall. When she was just reading the paragraphs, she was fine. But any time she had to speak out the dialogue, she just sounded like an idiot. Especially when trying to portray fear/panic, especially during the sex scenes, and most of all, when she lowered her voice to speak for men. It was incredibly distracting.<br /><br />Perhaps all audiobooks are like this, I don't know. All I do know is that I reached a point where I just couldn't stand listening to her voice any longer, and switched to reading the physical book.<br /><br />As far as the book itself goes, the general consensus that I've seen online is true. Poor writing quality, and extreme REPETITION. She uses the exact same adjectives, descriptive phrases and exclamatory phrases OVER AND OVER again, and this is also irritating me. I'm almost to the end of the second book right now, and the only reason I even want to read the third is because I feel like I'm obligated to finish... not because I'm heavily invested in the story. I'm getting really sick of it, actually. It's like every single day they have is exactly the same. He does something controlling, they have a fight, then they have sex. OVER AND OVER.<br /><br />And by the way, the sex scenes aren't anything special, either. The BDSM has been, so far (again, only through the second book), very minimal. There's a couple of scenes where she's trying it, but once she decides it's not for her, he gives it up and they mostly just have regular sex. And the first several sex scenes are very steamy... but after about a dozen scenes of the writer just using the name vocabulary repetitively... BORING. I find myself now, when they get to a sex scene, thinking \\"ugh, again?!\\" and just skimming over it. I'm not a reader of grocery store romance novels, but I think you could probably get better quality sex scenes there.<br /><br />Lastly... as a Twilight fan, it's extremely obvious to me that this used to be a Twilight fan-fiction (which is how it started, for those who don't know.) I think they literally didn't change a single thing except the names. Everything that Christian says has me thinking \\"That sounds like something Edward would say.\\" Every description that Anastasia gives about herself or him, I'm thinking \\"Ugh, that's so Bella. Whiny, self-depricating and dull as a doormat.\\" Some of the phrases seem to be exact copies of writing used in Twilight. (i.e: \\"He smiled, but it didn't touch his eyes.\\" I've never read or heard that said anywhere but in these two series.) To me, it feels like the exact same story, too. Dangerous, mysterious boy meets young, innocent girl. It's the first time either of them has been in love. His dark world comes in to haunt them, her and her average world have trouble fitting in. The only real difference is that instead of being a vampire, he's a sado-masochist.<br /><br />Enter cautiously. If you're worried it might be a waste of your time, it probably is. But above all, save yourself the irritation and read the book yourself instead of listening.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This movie was impressive.  The humor was good, the story was great, and the animation was amazing!  My kids and I were iffy at first just because we didn't think we would warm up to Ralph.  We loved this movie!  My kids are 3 and 4 and a half years old.  You should check this movie out.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I think it's odd that the version they sell on Amazon apps has no ads, but the one in Google Play does.

B005XOPEOU|4.0|I mean it - they have grown so much from were they were some ten years ago with music. They have grown immensely, but it hasn't all been that terrible :) Some things deviate from their traditional stuff, but you can still play one of their songs and know who is on the other side of the speaker.<br /><br />Some songs I fire up when I want to get pumped up for a workout (waterfall) while other songs I just play for background music when I need to chill. It's a good collection of songs - I'd say go for it.

So  I thought that I would get a case to protect my kindle fire HD but to my disappointment it turned out to be some nylon case that does the job to protect the device but that was as far as it went.  It looks cheap compared to her case an she paid the same price.

B001R4CKGU|2.0|I did not enjoy this book because I felt it was beautifully written in certain areas and horribly written in others. At some point I just lost interest.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I enjoyed the acting.  Many good actors.  It had a unique plot.  Very suspenseful.  Just the way I like my thrillers.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I hardly ever say this but...the movie is better than the book. Parts of the book felt very drawn out and lost my interest. I'm glad they made Robert DeNiro's character likable in the movie because in the book he is a complete jerk and I don't know why the other characters would want to have a relationship with him.

B00B2TUKI0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites, She has a great voice and her songs are sweet.<br />One of the artist I seem to love every song on her CD's. I now will buy as soon as I see a new one. I have never been disappointed...this is the same experience..I wish she could put out a new one every 6 months,,,hahahah<br />She is that good a real talent in my humble opinion...<br />I hope any one reading this enjoys her as much as I do....:)
B0063GORYU|5.0|All I know is that my husband loves this game!  When he can't sleep he gets into playing this game and plays for an hour or two at a time and then he can sleep.  I really like it too.
B003G4W49C|4.0|As a sci fi book this is a great starter book to introduce the genre. You can call it a gateway sci fi book for if you enjoy it you will probably read another similar novel.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I like Steven's writing style. It cuts the clutter and goes directly to the point. For me personally, I can really relate what he says to my own experience. Impactful book! I wish there are more in it, but its brevity is what makes this book so great.

B000YHG72E|4.0|I thought this was one of the few newer age Christmas films that was well done. It's humorous and it has a great story line. It's a great family movie. There's no substitute for the Classics, but if you've seen many of them, and still looking for a festive film, this is definitely worth watching.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This was a fresh, fun movie with lots of laughs and also a compelling story about friendship and being comfortable with who we are.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|i like it, it is good and fine<br />the transport is fast, only 3 days i get it . .
B007UZO3F6|5.0|This is just the size and shape I was looking for.  It fits nicely on a shelf above my workbench. I really wanted the color red or any color except black but it was the only color I could find available. It is plenty fast and quiet enough -- I barely hear it when the room is quiet and not at all when the house heat pump runs. In fact I have to turn off my external hard drive to hear the computer.  It draws less than 60 watts and gives me a much longer run time on my UPS after power loss than with my old computer.  I am using it with Windows 8 mostly as a DVR with media center installed and an external networked cable card tuner (HD Homerun Prime). I am also digitizing, storing and editing old home audio tape recordings and vcr recordings (VHS, VHS-C, miniDV). I installed a FireWire card for interfacing.  I did not install a video card but the on-board video works fine. Even though it is called a gaming PC, I don't use it for gaming. I installed a Samsung 120 GB SSD for the operating system, 2 TB hard driver for files,16 GB of RAM and a Blu-ray burner optical drive. Did I mention it was fast. I have a working mouse cursor and keyboard in only 15 seconds from power on.  I use an external USB 3.0 drive for storage and it is much faster than the USB 2.0 interface I'd been using. As with all computers I looked at there are not enough USB ports to attach all my gadgets so I added an external USB hub.  I had no trouble with installation and found it easy to work with in spite of the small size.  I have had one small concern. In the 2 months I've had the unit on 24/7 it has twice locked up while I was manipulating files in the media center and I had to cycle power.  I don't know whether this is a hardware or software problem.    Update a month later:  I have had 2 or 3 more instances of the computer locking up or shutting down when doing a lot of graphics related tasks. It is fine on reboot. So far it is just an annoyance but I decided to look online at the Shuttle forum. It seems others have been having this problem. It is not an overheating problem. On April 5th someone posted saying they had found the cause in the bios. If true, I hope Shuttle issues a corrected bios soon.    Here is the link [...]  Overall I still love the computer.

1455128333|4.0|I'm not sure what I expected from this book.  I want to see the movie, suo I thougt it would be best to read the book first.<br /><br />The story is about a man, Pat, that has to learn how to live life all over again.  After a tramautic event with his now exwife, he is put into mental institution also known as the \\"bad place\\".  This story is the journey in Pat's own mind and the interactions with his family and friends as he tries to get a grip on life once again.<br /><br />There were some very sad spots, but overall I thought the book showed a life of triumph.  The exact same circumstances can appear completely different with the benefit of hindsight.<br /><br />Overall I thought it was a good read and I enjoyed it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Won't regret this buy. I was waiting for the show but decided to just read this instead. I read it on my Kindle before bed. It is a very long book so be prepared.

0740748475|5.0|I have owned at one time or another all of the Calvin & Hobbes trade paperbacks and through the years (and three children) the books have been lovingly destroyed in the best possible way, through countless readings and re-readings.  Now that my children are older I finally have treated myself to 'The Complete Calvin and Hobbes' hardcover set.  The largest and most expensive book set to ever make the New York Times bestseller list and with good reason.  As a fan, it is a must have addition to your home library printed on art book-grade paperstock.  The set is incredibly well made and executed.  I have a nineth printing set from October 2012 that seems to have corrected any issues concerning the binding.  My set arrived well before the estimated shipping arrival date (thanks again Amazon) and is worth every penny.  As close to a real treasure chest as you're likely to ever have!  Do not hesitate!  I prefer the weight (24 lbs.) and size of the hardcover edition because it forces one to properly place the books for reading and of course will stand the test of time, but if you prefer a lighter package with more flexibility then you may want to opt for the paperback version of this set.  Either way, be prepared to take a journey in your own personal time machine back, not to the Jurassic Era as Calvin would, but to when Calvin and Hobbes ruled the Earth!
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I thought all 3 starring roles were good in this film ... and it was a good story teaching about belief in oneself.  Positive lesson that belief + hard work can make a success and an underlying lesson about over obsessing on the things that don't matter in the long run.
B000JLSM00|5.0|This is perhaps John Wayne's best movie performance. He plays a seemingly unlikeable character whose sole purpose in life becomes exacting revenge for the murder of his brother, sister-in-law, niece ... and the kidnapping of his other niece.  Gripping, well-acted, beautifully filmed - a great western with many fine character actors as well as John Wayne, a young Natalie Wood (and a younger Lana Wood), Ward Bond, Jeff Hunter...

Fleming would have enjoyed the physicality and toughness of his spy as portrayed by Daniel Craig.  No longer the simply suave poof in a tux, no longer going for cheap laughs, this Bond goes for action and gets messed up and then comes back and wins the day.  Bond as he was meant to be.

B00005JSGK|5.0|Filmed with an international cast in a country that technically doesn't exist any more.  Live animal chases in the wilds of Afrtica - the plot is capturing animals for zoos around the world, you could not make this movie today (it would be CGI which would suck).  John Wayne and a bunch of his favorite actors and crew filmed HATARI! on location, in 1962, filled with action, beautiful scenery, and all the period sexism, boozing and smoking one could ask for.  But seriously, it's a fun movie you can watch with your kids.  WIsh I could drive among a herd of giraffes.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|the doctor wrote it in a way every one can read and understand it. even the medical and scientific wording.<br />great book.
B00947N6UG|5.0|We took my daughter almost five to see this in the theaters around Thanksgiving and she loved it.  She got so involved with the story that she screamed at Pitch, and then cheered when the Guardians won in the end, the others in the theater all agreed with her sentiment.  So I knew I would have to pick this up when it came out.  After getting it today and watching it again with her she had a blast with it, cheering at the end, a little scared in the middle but enjoying the story.  Since we originally saw it, I have read the Guardian books to her and she loves them.<br /><br />  It is your typical good vs. bad story and overcoming something to find out who you really are.  The animation was good, I don't have a 3d Tv so o idea on that, but the blu-ray had a great picture.  Haven't checked out the bonus features yet.<br /><br />Overall this is a fun story of good triumphing over evil and finding your place in the world.  Would recommend it for any family with children who still believe.
0307279189|4.0|This book really has a great story.  Anyone will enjoy that.  The other aspect of this book is that it will inspire you.  I have found that everyone I know who has read this is inspired to run.  This thing makes you think so much about traditional notions of what is accurate when it comes to exercise and fitness.  The only criticism I have ever heard about it is that it romanticizes a really poor culture of Mexican indians.  I thought the book was great.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Good Movie with alot of action.  The story line was alittle wanting when you keep in mind the previous version.  But a good watch.
0393317552|4.0|This book gave me insight into things I had never thought about before.  For the first time in my life, natural selection and evolution made literal sense.  Also, the views of the history of civilizations were incredible enlightening.  If I had one complaint about this book, it would be that it is extremely academic.  I still recommend it all the time.
1609611543|5.0|Two Sundays ago my brother called to tell me about the book, `Wheat Belly'.<br />He asks me, how tall are wheat plants? I immediately visualize 4 to 6 feet in height thinking back to the childhood days of passing wheat plantations in Northern India. Not so he replies, '18 to 24 inches and out producing traditional plants by a factor of x'.<br /><br />Immediately, alarm bells go off in my mind about GMO and other scientific applications to reduce the height and increase production.<br /><br />At this point, without reading the book and knowing any benefits other than weight loss as he suggests, I declare to my brother, I am dropping wheat from my diet. Yes, just like that.<br /><br />I kid you not, in just 2 days of NO wheat, I feel mentally alert! For the past few years I have been thinking, why is it that I wake up mentally `out of it' in the mornings. It usually took me until middle of the day to warm up `mentally'.<br />I don't smoke, watch no TV most evenings, eat well, exercise, do yoga almost every evening and yet, wake up mentally tired.<br /><br />I had no idea about the mental `fog' concept. Now that I have the book, I understand why. I am done with wheat.<br /><br />I am waiting to see what sort of weight loss I experience (will update this review as time goes by).<br /><br />I also speak frequently to parents about helping their kids make good and informed choices. [[ASIN:0970813139 Raising Yourself : Making the Right Choices]]<br /><br />Will talk up the book 'Wheat Belly' effective immediately.
0385523912|5.0|This is one of those books you walk around telling everyone you know about.  The misery in North Korea is incredible.  This book does an incredible job highlighting life in North Korea.  It is hard to imagine that otherwise productive people could be placed in a controlled environment like North Korea.  It also makes you worry what the leadership of the country is really capable of.  I highly recommend this book.

111846446X|5.0|This book has a message beyond introducing you to the Pi.  Eben Upton, co-creator of the Raspberry Pi, and one of the author's of the book, takes you through the history of development and the ideological motivation for developing the Pi.<br /><br />Succinctly to paraphrase his argument in the foreword: Kids don't actually know much about technology because they cannot program; GUI is as far as they get and that isn't getting very far.<br /><br />From this welcome admission and shattering of tired generational assumptions that the young are somehow organically technically talented Upton posits and moves to remedy what he sees as a crisis.  Thus the story of the Pi's beginning is discursive and motivated by an educator putting to practice his talents: education and empowerment through that instruction!<br /><br />Upton and his co-author Gareth Halfacree guide the read through topics that range from the Pi's basic ARM architecture and its implications for the OS it can run, setting up a Linux system on the Pi, getting it past the command line and ultimately making the Pi and the flavor of Linux running on it a productive programming environment.<br /><br />What is refreshing is unlike many books on the Pi they don't dwell on the size of the board.  They don't waste space in conversational and loose writing.  Rather, they give you information and educate. This is precisely what a technical book ought to be and ought to facilitate: understanding!<br /><br />But that is not all!  The two also augment this trove of information with a Python primer, a media center crash course, and even discuss the expansion boards available for the Pi --included the very powerful Gertboard.<br /><br />I like this book so much I bought a bound copy merely to support a good piece of technical writing!<br /><br />Congratulations on this book and I hope anyone who reads this review finds the book as instructive and valuable!

B008PZZV8S|5.0|Wonderful murder mystery with a great cast. . One of Matt Damon's early movies. Also stars Jude Law, Gwenth Paltrow, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Like reading a good book. Definitely not a cookie-cutter formula movie. High on plot and doesn't have today's over-the-top violence and action scenes.<br /><br />I am a Prime member and this movie is free on demand  to Prime customers. Video and audio feed was great. Highly recommend this movie to mystery lovers.

0385535147|1.0|There are a few things wrong with this novel.-- SPOILERS---<br />1. The timeline is awkward in order to hold back vital information, but it simply doesn't work. It makes the narrator unreliable.<br />2. The story is just simply unbelievable in every aspect. We are supposed to believe that Max did not actually launder money, that he is innocent, yet as soon as he is released from prison he knows exactly what to do and who to go to to launder the money and does. As an act of revenge, we are supposed to believe. That is only one unreal aspect of the novel. There are dozens like this. The first chapter he speaks about how he adores his son, is why he wants out, lives for him etc and then the son is only mentioned one more time in later chapters. His family relationships are like this as well. Dad is important in the 1st 1/3rd of the book but then only mentioned again one time.<br /><br />3. The money. Max initially gets 150k and talks about how he is now \\"rich\\" what? I didn't use a calculator, but it seems as if he goes through this money in about a week. When he hits the real jackpot, he seems just as impressed with it as the 150k.<br /><br />4. The relationship with Vanessa was just not well set up. We are told in the 1st half that he barely knows her, they share a few letters but that's it. When he gets out of jail however, the relationship goes from near strangers to intensely sexual and romantic and then she becomes a willing partner immediately. She leaves her job and does what he says and turns out that she was apparently in on the whole thing from the beginning, but that is never really made clear.<br /><br />5. It's boring. Mind-numbingly boring with no action, dozens and dozens of pages where nothing moves forward.<br /><br />6. None of the characters are really written so that you get to know them. Except maybe the one who gets the brunt of the punishment. The others, even Max, are 1 dimensional- unlikable and uninteresting.<br /><br />7. The biggest issue isthat this is told in 1st person for most of the novel- Max is the narrator. Yet, Max tells us nothing. He is keeping the secrets from us, the reader, in order to add mystery but this does not work. This is a confessional style narration and he should be confessing everything, not playing us.<br /><br />It's just not a good book. I even bought the audio book AND the kindle and did the narration thing on the kindle HD because I could not stop falling asleep after 10 minutes of reading. It took days to get through this book- nearly 10. Gone Girl I finished in one setting, napping for a couple hours but then waking early because I.Could.Not.Stop.Thinking.About.It. Not my favorite book, but definitely a fast intense read. Hunger Games, I finished all three in a day.<br />This took 10 days because I fell asleep so much. I would have just tossed it, but I am not the type that can leave a book unfinished. No matter how bad it is. And this one was bad.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|I loved this movie, I did. The animation was phenomenal. The story line was a bit lacking though. Not to mention, didn't Disney already come out with a movie where someone turns into a bear? But anyway, there are still a lot of really enjoyable things in this film and there are some incredibly humorous parts (particularly the three princes). It's a great movie to watch with your kids or without them. You should watch it!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|this is such an awesome show. im glad my friend turned me on to it. the characters are rich and believable. The story line carry's through from one episode to the next and is riveting all during the show. I don't know how they come up with such believable scenarios and story lines its just so nice to have Sunday eve waiting for me. Good luck for years to come, although I don't think you will need it.<br />Thank you very much for entertainment that is on the cutting edge of reality!!!!!
B000GOY3I0|3.0|I saw this movie when it first came out. It's a fun little romp and keeps some of the best of what the originals played on, but it's not a keeper. Honestly, I think it's more fun for adults who remember the original than it is for kids, who were never exposed to the cartoon version.
B00786XVOG|5.0|I enjoy having this on the CD and sit back and listen to all the instruments playing. Alot of different sound effects.
B004MYFUC8|5.0|I absolutely love the movie &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34; (Kierra Knightly/Matthew MacFayden version), and decided it was time to read the book (since more often than not, the book is better).  It was an enjoyable read, and I got to read in depth parts that did not make it into the movie.  It wasn't a quick read for me, but I liked the challenge.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I rent this movie all the time! My grandson loves it. I rent it and he watches it over and over. I watch it with him and I have to say, I love it too!

B00001PE4D|5.0|I loved every minute of this movie.  Sarah Michelle Geller and the entire cast are such pros.  They deliver their lines flawlessly...and seem to be having a great time doing so.  The end is tragic....but it's all part of the story....too bad it could not have ended on a more positive note.  You will see what I mean once you view the film...I will not give any of it away.  Highly recommended!

B000I9TY4G|4.0|FIrefly was one of the best Sci-Fi shows in years. It was original and creative and filled with nothing less then I would expect from Joss Whedon. His (and the writers...) dialogue is always clever, biting and cheeky. I will miss this series immensly. The movie was good- as a fan of the show it does leave me wanting more. But I want the series back on the air too.
0062238868|5.0|I love this book, it really shows what a hero Chris Kyle was. I have listened to the book on an audio book.
1451678193|5.0|I venture to claim this as a masterpiece.  It excites me to no end to realize that there are many more Bradbury books to read - this one having been my first (shamefully!)<br />It reads like a chronological series of short stories, although a handful of characters make encore presentations.<br /><br />This book, as it seems to me, is a statement on man's inability to accept what is, and his desire to constantly \\"improve\\".  Bradbury illustrates a case that this never-ending endeavor to \\"improve\\" ultimately destroys.  Beauty, simplicity, life itself...all are distorted and/or destroyed in man's quest for bigger and better.<br /><br />Each chapter provides a different perspective and insight.  Ultimately, they all depict the same dystopia, and we all can guess where it's headed...although, as humans, we maintain at least a shred of hope.  And you know what?  Maybe we're right to hope - maybe hanging on to and believing in hope will save the world yet!<br /><br />Sensational read.
B008X77K8W|5.0|Great cd from one of the best singer/songwriters out there.  Extremely underrated musician.  If Nashville country had even part of his talent, I would start listening to mainstream country again.  But they don't, so I will stick to these guys who write and play their own music.
B004UPAIDK|5.0|This movie was nothing like I expected. A little trippy in some places (the deer head) and absolutely hilarious in others (the evil hand). MUST SEE!! Classic!!!<br /><br />Well done! And plus... its easy viewing through Amazon. Had no problems. ;)
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Rihanna's Unapologetic album is good. I like the high tempo beats and her slow songs, especially the one called &#34;Stay&#34;.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|I've always been into heavier music but I've also been a closet Eagles fan my whole life so as I got older I started to embrace a lot of the 'poppier' bands that they played on the radio when I was a kid (the 70's).  So I was very excited when I found out the Eagles would be making not just an album but what amounts to a double albums worth of material.  The songs are fantastic and the vocal harmonies are the best you're going to hear from any American band outside of the Beach Boys.  Unfortunately the bad news is the vinyl version is absolutely dreadful.  The packaging is beautiful and you definitely get your money's worth but every time some one sings a word with an 'S' in it, and there are many, it sounds like a barrel of snakes are squirming out of your speaker.  Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.  I've been collecting vinyl my whole life and I've never experienced such a shoddy vinyl transfer/mixing/mastering job...whatever you want to call it.  And knowing that these gentlemen are the consummate professionals and they take their music and fans VERY seriously I'm very shocked and dismayed by this.  I'm betting that the band never even bothered to play test the final vinyl mix otherwise they never would've signed off on it.<br /><br />So I have a couple of questions:<br /><br />Is it my system?<br />Is it my specific copy of vinyl?<br />Is it like this on CD versions?<br /><br />I truly doubt it's any of these things but for the sake of discussion I would like some input from some one else that has purchased the vinyl.  Until then I'm forced to give this vinyl version two stars at most, and I'm being very generous.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I listened to this on a friends system and it seems that unfortunately my turntable has seen better days.  This album is a solid four stars for any serious Eagles fan.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' album, called The Heist is a great album! The beats are great and easy to dance to, especially &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; and &#34;Can't Hold Us.&#34;
B000EHRVP6|5.0|IT ARRIVED ON TIME LIKE ALWAYS IT WAS WRAP VERY WELL SO NO DAMAGE WOULD HAPPEN.  I LOVE IT SO MUCH
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It can get boring after a while, but it is a nice relaxing game to play. The prices of some items are also crazy, but its not too bad.
B00008EYA5|5.0|IT ARRIVED ON TIME LIKE ALWAYS IT WAS WRAP VERY WELL SO NO DAMAGE WOULD HAPPEN.  I LOVE IT SO MUCH
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Up there with Tolkien's trilogy.  Told as a story within a story in a first person narrative.  Images are freshly described and richly detailed.  Characters richly developed.  Only problem - as of March '12, third and final book not released.  I can't wait.
B005OK722U|5.0|IT ARRIVED ON TIME LIKE ALWAYS IT WAS WRAP VERY WELL SO NO DAMAGE WOULD HAPPEN.  I LOVE IT SO MUCH
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is now officially my favorite 007!  Connery is still great but DC hits the mark in more ways than one as the MI6 agent we all know and love.  He plays the character almost exactly as Ian Flemming originally wrote the character, not how he was modeled for the movies.<br /><br />This movie combines classic elements with new flair and sets up the story for more great adventures.  No spoilers here but if you are a longtime Bond fan, the last scene can best be described as Classic!  It made me want to watch the next installment right away!!<br /><br />For my money, the best Bond yet and I can't wait to see more!
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|I have been following Steven Wilson since a British friend turned me on to Up the Down Stair in the early 90's. I wouldn't say I'm a rabid fan, more someone admiring all of his work from afar. I've seen Porcupine Tree several times live. The first of those times was at a show in Boulder where only a handful of people were there. I was blown away, as was everyone else. Not as much by the sound or the music as by the feeling of being in the same room with the guys on stage. Particularly Richard and Steven. In a world lacking musical and personal honesty Steven just emitted it.<br /><br />At times on recent albums I have felt like some of the depth of that integrity had fallen away (as it does with many things that become popular, but the upside is that at least more people get to enjoy it that way and the artist gets to keep doing it, which is of utmost importance in the end).  I always looked at Porcupine Tree as a sort of Steven Wilson project anyway so when Steven did \\"solo\\" albums I thought it odd. In some cases the songs felt like they maybe didn't make the cut for a PT album OR Steven was branching out musically. I was never as excited by them as PT albums but they were still amazing nevertheless :-).<br /><br />HOWEVER, the moment I heard the first few vocal lines of the title track of this album I felt the same thing I had all those years ago at that show. Something that had gone missing was back in his voice. I can say I don't hear it as much on other tracks on this album. There is some of it on The Incident Disc One on \\"Kneel and Disconnect\\". It is this terrifyingly melancholic everything-gone-horribly-wrong sadness. The kind that brings back memories you didn't know you had. Puts you on your knees. Overtakes you emotionally. Its like the nicest, most positive little 7 year old boy on the playground is singing to you about how deeply sad and confusing life really is. All of the technical prowess falls by the wayside when you feel that. THAT is true and indelible artistry.<br /><br />You should buy this album if just to experience and own that.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a great move for the entire family - from grandma to my 8 year old daughter.  This is definately one of her most favorite movies.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I really enjoyed this story. The first chapter was a slight struggle for some reason but once I got passed that, for the rest of it I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I had watched the movie first but this, as usual, gave more detail and a better rounded story,<br /><br />I like that we are never quite sure whether the story with the animals or the story with the humans its the 'true' one, it leaves you thinking.<br /><br />Highly recommend
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett writes exciting fiction and the histories often contain information I had not known from other sources. The characters portrayed make the books &#34;a good read&#34;. However there is a little too much gratuitous sex for my taste. I do like the fact that all the main characters survive, making for &#34;happy endings&#34;, however unrealistic. One gets enough &#34;angst&#34; from the younger author. for those of us  who are older amd less intense, all that anger and depression is a &#34;downer&#34;.For other insights into the second world war, I suggest that authors Herman Wouk and Len Deighton.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Love it!!! amazing quality and the side buttons where very cool. I will recomend it to anyone. Very secure fit also.
0451232577|4.0|As always, I enjoyed Ken Follett's book. He makes history exciting and interesting without getting the reader too distressed. As  a history of the terrible and unnecessary conflict between the allies and Germany, there are other better fictional descriptions such a Anne Perry's., However, the history of the union movement in Wales and women's suffrage, which predated the American women's right to vote was informative.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great episode as always, glad to find NCIS online. It is a favorite at our house and hard to find online if you miss an episode.
B00BHMF578|2.0|I did not get the quality I paid for. It was constantly struggling to keep the HD video quality. The movie was great but just the annoyance with streaming made the experience a little unpleasant.
6304981635|5.0|I purchased this as a present.  I am very happy with my purchase and would order from this seller again.
B003ZJ0ZX0|2.0|I like this CD a lot. I just did not get it here. I ordered it and I thought it came a week later I opened the package and it was packed in a loose envelope and the jewel case was smashed. I was worried about the CD but alas... there was no CD in the case! I called Amazon and quickly got a full refund and I went to Wal-Mart and picked it up there brand new on sale.  .
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I purchased this because of all the hype because of the movie coming out. Even though the movie is very good the books are so much better.  I am glad I read the books first.  I will keep looking into other books by this author.  I really enjoyed his work.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Love the fact that its based on a true story. Love the suspense but mostly love the courage it took to get through what those people did.
B00008G8LV|5.0|I purchased this for a present for my brother.  He loved getting it.  I received it in plenty of time and in great condition.  I would order from this seller again and recommend them to family and friends.
B005LAIHHC|1.0|SBC is yet again a disappointment in this movie.  I cannot believe that I wasted my money on this &#34;film&#34;.  How it was even produced for theaters is beyond my understanding.
B000TGJ8F8|5.0|I purchased this for a present for my brother.  He loved getting it.  I received it in plenty of time and in great condition.  I would order from this seller again and recommend them to family and friends.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My kids love this movie.  They watch it at least 3 times per week.  Love it!!!!!!!  Cannot wait for the sequel.
6305232660|5.0|I purchased this for a present and I am very happy with my purchase and would order from this seller again.
B007HIEBV2|5.0|I greatly appreciate the originality and thought given in music created by this particular group.  Instead of going with whatever sounds and beats they've heard overused in common popular music, they reach out, experiment, and find something new that they like.  They won't let the mass populous &#34;vote&#34; (so to speak) on what they make, they make the beauty that is in them and give that to us to judge.  I judge it to be incredible.
6305127638|5.0|I purchased this for a present and I am very happy with my purchase and would order from this seller again.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I had a hard time staying interested in this book.  The story line was boring at times.  I didn't like the characters, and the ending was predictable from about 2/3 of the way through the book.  Gillian Flynn is a good writer - I absolutely LOVED &#34;Dark Places&#34; and I liked &#34;Gone Girl&#34;, too (except for the way it ended).  This book was disappointing by comparison.  It's worth the read, I guess, but it's nothing to write home about.
0783225547|5.0|I purchased this for a present. I am very happy with my purchase and would order from this seller again.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|Always one of my favorite albums as well as movies; Prince and the Revolution's Purple Rain is the best album from them. Full of wonder songs and great memories for me. Every song brings be the movie clearly. Remembering how I felt the first time seeing this movies. Loving these songs over and over. It even won the Oscar for movie song. I still remember Prince clearly telling everyone how the song itself was actually written by Wendy and Lisa; and how they didn't get the credit on the album. Standing before all those people and the television audience saying 'This is not my song alone' was a very big thing for him to do. Great memories!!
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I purchased this for a present I have to double check his DVDs he may already have it an I may have to return it.  Received it in plenty of time and in great condition.  I would recommend this seller and would order from them again.
0679411585|5.0|I am a Vietnam Veteran. I find this to be an excellent representation of the battle and the war. I highly recommend this book to anyone who cares to know what we wen through and what war is like in general
B002ZBN13A|5.0|In my opinion this was their best album. You can actually listen through the album without feeling the need to skip through it. Definitely worth the buy.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This follows very closely what I was taught of the history of the war. Tom Berenger and Jeff Daniels are excellent in their roles.
B00B23O96A|3.0|Eric Clapton's new album \\"Old Sock\\" (what an aweful title for an album) was released today. I've been listening to it for the last week (thanks to the online streaming) and I've come to the sad conclusion that \\"Old Sock\\" is uninspired, flat and at times it's even slightly boring. This CD could've been called \\"Clapton Volume 2\\" because it's more of the same kind of music and production we were treatted to on his last album. That's not to say it's all bad! There are some fantastic moments on \\"Old Sock\\" as there were on \\"Clapton\\", but they're few and far between. As both a professional musician and as an avid Clapton for the last twenty five years it is my never-to-be-humbled opinion that Eric Clapton needs to seriously change his backing band and producer. I feel like he's gotten too comfortable working with the same people year after year, and just like an old sock that has gotten far too comfortable they all need to be replaced. Eric Clapton is always at his very best when he's being pushed in some way, and I don't feel like he was pushed at all during the recording of this album... and what's up with that terrible cover? YUCK! Anyway, in closing I just wanna say that if like me you're a longtime Clapton fan ofcourse you're gonna need to pick this album up ASAP. Just don't look for the kinds of guitar fireworks and pure unbridled passion that we've come to expect from Eric Clapton. I sincerely hope that his next album will be considerably better! I hope that you've found this review somewhat useful in helping you decide weather or not to pick up this album. I apologize for having to give anything by Eric Clapton only three stars, but I just wasn't utterly blown away by \\"Old Sock\\". PS \\"Gotta Get Over\\" is a pretty good song as are several others on this album. PEACE!
B00APKIN1I|4.0|Music is extraordinary. Really top notch. Albums registers as a DR6 out of 20 for dynamic range so don't expect vinyl sounds. Sad.
0061928356|5.0|I bought this book for my mom and she loved it. She couldn't put it down. I haven't read the book yet but she told me that it was a great book. She told me everything that happened and it seems like a great book to read.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Not as good as I expected<br />The real story was better than the script.<br />Most of the actors did a very good work.
B00005MHNB|5.0|My dads a history fanatic as well so I bought this for him for his birthday and of course he loved it
0765325950|4.0|Good ending but the last battle took to long. I had many hours of pleasure reading this whole series. Sorry to see it end.
B004529NKC|5.0|Anyone who loves the dance movies has to get this movie. Its part of the step up series and although the overall plot is sometimes cliche, the dance moves are amazing.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved the first book.  The second was good but not at good as the first.  Disappointed with this book because I didn't feel it really resolved the story.  Why wasn't there any exchange between Julian and Lena resolving their relationship?  Lena just says Alex is her choice and then he just lets her go start tearing down the wall!  Why isn't he with her?  Could have ended so much better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the way it makes your mind work !  Such a brain teaser. Once you get started you are hooked, you just don't want to put it down !
B001BKTEZA|5.0|My college Englishj professor (Helen Mallonee) loved Steinbeck - and why not? He writes so beautifully about an awful time in our history and awful things that take place! It is amazing - even when read for the ninth or tenth time for Book Club, as I did this time. The descriptions, the action, the people, the movement of life is unmatched by anyone at this time! The Nobel Prize for Literature was appropriately awarded for this! (The movie, though not an exact track of the book, is also very good! See it soon!)
B004DTLKEE|5.0|This is an awesome movie and after seeing Hillary do this film after The Next Karate Kid i knew she was going to be able to do any film! The movie was sent to me on time it was in great shape when i recieved. If the chance comes up i would buy from this company again. An Oscar winning film!
B001O1O71C|5.0|This was very interesting to read.  Makes me wonder how many children went without ever being counted...... How many people went without every being counted...
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Great buy on a used movie. It looked bran new when we got it in the mail. loved the movie :)
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Very good, nice quality of the picture and sound, good performance, Sierra is very good, worth to own it ...
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|We got the movie very quick, and it was just like new. We love all the Toy Story movies :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't stop reading this book!! Keeps you on the edge of your seat having to know what's gonna happen next!!  LOVE the story between the Sky and Holder. Will be rereading it again soon!!!
B00275EHJG|5.0|We enjoyed this Toy Story Movie, not as much as 1 or 2 but its still a good movie. Glad to own.
B008HLZUUE|5.0|A wonderful continuation of the series.  This book takes up right from the end of book 4 and continues it's marvelous tale of Seven Kingdoms.  It doesn't lose a beat and pulls you right back into the story from the first page.  A must read!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun and realistic. I am a real life horse rider so it is always fun to see a new horse game to try!
B005PK553C|5.0|If your a horror (especially ghost) fan, you have to see this show!  Season 1 was the best show I've ever watched, the anticipation from week to week was excruciating!

B007V2UGPE|5.0|Very fun I don't usually like glu games but this one is great. Has a lot of good stuff and lots of things to do.
0547848412|4.0|good book... very thought-provoking!  Now I want to see the movie and determine if it does the book and story justice.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Tells me almost all the words i need to know and helpful for when I dont kwow the definition overall helpful
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Great game as far as the game play but instead of one unlock price for the upgrades it continues to Nickle and dime you throughout the game to level up.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Perfect music! In conjunction with the history of the performer... simply the best<br />I recommend to all who want to support SugarMan
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My computer is running super cool and breezy.  If you read the instructions its an easy install and works great!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Perfect music! In conjunction with the history of the performer... simply the best<br />I recommend to all who want to support SugarMan
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I would recommend this board to any first time installers.  It was easy to install and over the phone tech support was great!
1455519006|4.0|David Baldacchi is one of my favorites.  This affordably priced soft cover, in excellent condition, fit the bill to perfection.
0385535139|5.0|I prefer nonfiction. However, every now and again I need a break, but a fiction break that is also challenging and engaging. Another &#34;what's around the corner&#34; legal thriller. J.G. did not let me down with this one either. The bad guys again got their due!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and full of practical ideas. Everyone can benefit from taking a look at their live style.  Follow this book you will have more free time and spend less time taking care of the stuff you do not want or need.  It opens a world of possibilities.
B001APM46W|5.0|Great songs with a neat sound and feel that you really don't hear anymore. Just different than any other album out there.
B00843TZJM|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with the Blu-Ray having both positive and negative reviews. It is solid, if not spectacular. Could have been much, much better. Disappointed that is just in stereo as a lot of people are. And somewhat disappointed in the song selection. The sound is OK, but seems a little overmodulated/distorted sometimes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and the graphics are good. I wish there was an easier way to earn gems though...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of the best books I ever read!!! Love all three in the series, they are one of my favorites
B00947N6D8|5.0|This is such an awesome movie! My son (6) and i went on a date to see this film and we both laughed, and got excited watching! He has seen this film numerous times!! Soooo excited to finally watch it in the comfort of my home...def an amazing family movie night film ;-)
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|As a listener of Progressive Rock for over 40 years,I often mourn the passing insignificance of the great bands.  But then, there is the resurrection of the \\"spirit\\" with bands like Opeth, Riverside, Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, and Steve Wilson.  These guys do honor to a very under appreciated and sophisticated part of the rock world.<br /><br />On first listen to this recording, I knew I had another gem to add to my collection.  Enter the world of Steve Wilson's mind, and find a curious peace and feeling of tranquility, and feel like you just finished an epic novel - eager for the next release.<br /><br />I can hear so many of the original masters in this recording - Howe, Hackett, Holdsworth - but I don't get the sense that Wilson is copying their efforts as much as honoring them.<br /><br />Welcome to my collection...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting and for everyone who doesn't know about minecraft and the poeple who don't have a computor to get the full version this is perfect!!!!!!!!!  :)
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I didn't see this in the theater & I really enjoyed watching it on Amazon.  Thank you for having free movies available to Prime members.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|a wonderful movie, it's like that photo you keep saved in your most confidential place. please, don't lose the chance to see her.
B000TU16GS|5.0|WONDERFULNESS!!!! it was very hooking and i  couldn't put it down!!! When i opened the book i just couldn't stop
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love puzzles of any kind so this one is fun too.  It is not difficult but is fun to do.  The pictures are also very pretty.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers was a great read!  I read the book in two days.  I couldn't put it down.  I was fascinated with the meanings of the flowers.  Mary Rose
1616550414|5.0|it came to me earlier than expected, it came in fine shape. the only problem i had was that the notice came later than the said time i had to pick the package up, it was no problem though but still..
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|This is the ultimate Rush album! It is awesome. It has been remastered and sounds great! When you go see them in concert this is what everyone wants to hear!
B008LFY6NI|5.0|It is possible to become distinctive at this Art even great.Contests are called for and a way to respin ones masterpieces.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|The show was good when it came out. Its fun to watch now. It just had a bad release time becouse of the writers strikes. A lot of great shows where lost due to that crap shoot.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|If you were a singer, or if If you like music, you'll love the movie!  Some off-color jokes but extremely funny throughout!  And the final performance is awesome!
B0086700CM|5.0|its the most amazing game ever I hope they keep making new. temple runs like temple run brave or temple run two
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Format of the app is good, but without the ability to sort though results is a deal killer.  I uninstalled it after about 1 minute.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Different ways to have your notes, remember things ad have them in your hand , one of the most usefull apps
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This sweeper, is a upgrade to the Original, seen on TV, swivel sweeper. Very good for a spill, no liquid, but many other things, it is quick to grab and take care of the mess....
B00006IUIG|4.0|Fellini has influenced many contemporary directors and this dreamy film is provocative and beautiful at the same time. Shot in black and white with beautiful shadows and light, any lover of film must watch this!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm not sure how long I have been using this but it really helps when studying to teach Sunday School and when I go to different prayer services or church services and they are using a different version.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've read Sanerson's &#34;Mistborn&#34; series and it was great (worth a read as well). &#34;The Way of Kings&#34; kept me reading until I was done. Each character's story kept you involved. Even though it was obvious who the main storyline revolved around, the other plots really build and surge forward to the main plot.<br />When I would finish a chapter I would be tempted to skip ahead and read more about that character, but each time I was glad I didn't as the I found myself interested in this characters storyline all over again.<br /><br />Analysis of cleanliness. I am happy to conclude this book has no sex included into the storyline, where romance is included. Further proof a book can be a masterpiece without including filth. Read with ease and enjoy a book from the great imagination of Brandon Sanderson
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is not just an adaption of a webbased technology. It actually is transformative. Finally, I can have all my notes in one place. Access it through any device anywhere with it being immediately updated.  It is a constant on my phone, tablets, computers and notebooks. The seemless integration with photos and the ability to share with others is amazing. I am now evaluating whether we should adopt the business version for my small business. I have had no bug issues or failures. The interface is intuitive. All in all this a truly great product.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked how it tied it all together and the conclusions were quite a surprise.  I think it fell flat only in the times after the games.  Other than that, it was a wonderful series.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Keyboard is clearly readable, The keys well spaced. Does everything that the whole range of HP calculators does. It's no my calculator of choice.
0345803507|5.0|This one was great - she tied it all together wonderfully and I loved how she ended with how it all began.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Had high hopes for this knowing it would be raunchy, but then we started looking at our ipads about halfway through and lost interest and stopped the movie.  They were really pulling at straws trying to keep it funny and it just wasn't.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie first - this book really explained and delved into so many other aspects.  Very well written.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This was a nice app to pass the time. I am new to Kindle and am still bumbling around with it but I have to say that I like this Solitaire app. I rate it 5 stars.
0345803485|5.0|Definately not for the young reader.  I really liked Ana's innocence and the portrayal of it all.  EL James did a wonderful job.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Somewhat predictable, but still pretty good. Matthew McConaughey gives a  believable performance as a lawyer. Like Trace Adkins' role as a biker.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very compelling.  I'm looking forward to the movie version.  I will have to read again before the movie comes out.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I know that I shouldn't be surprised that Bowie is putting out a genuinely great album.  Why would that be surprising?  He's been doing it for 40+ years.  Some might argue that there were a string of duds in the 80's (Tonight, Never Let Me Down), and in the interest of full disclosure, I would tell those folks that they need to go back and re-listen to those albums with fresh ears.  Both of them have some fantastic songwriting and while neither matches \\"Lodgers\\", \\"Heroes\\", or \\"Hunky Dory\\", they both merit affection. But now you know my bias and can hear what I have to say.<br /><br />The Next Day is inevitable.  It is a wonderful album that builds upon all that has come before, by turns nostalgiac and exploratory.  This is an album that does not seek to be the next Bowie album, but rather an album that seeks to be a good album period.  There have been a lot of song by song breakdowns, and I won't do that, but what I will try to convey is the feeling that you get when a great musician puts out a record at the top of his game.  This is one of those records.  The music is urgent and compelling, full of energy and life, mesmerizing.  His voice sounds great still, although it is not as rich as it once might have been, it still has many shades.  There is a sadness, an ache, and a power to provoke wonder as you listen to the record unfold; there is much reflection on love, and a life lived for love, and for change, and identity.  But mostly, it's music that you want to listen to--it's music that is enjoyable with or without the context of David over the last 40 years--music that my kids find compelling and I find wonderful for completely different reasons.<br /><br />I hope that this album triggers a new creative season for David, but if not, this is a fantastic album to have left us.  Pick it up.  5 stars, unreservedly, passionately.
0345803493|5.0|This one was full of surprises and kept me hanging - I was very ready to see how it all ended.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I love this book.  I really enjoyed book one, and i had a bit of a hard time with book two with all the gory battle scenes but book three is the best.  Diana Gabaldon is an excellent writer.  Her descriptions give you a taste and feel for all the characters.<br />Great job.<br />Pamela
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really liked this book - I think the movie wasn't NEARLY as good as the book and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a wonderful love story.  Very touching.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the 1st book or so I thought but, this book surpasses it.<br />It had my attention from the start. And the ending was beyond anything. I totally recommend this book..
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It has some great references to video games for gamers.  Overall I was underwhelmed.  I should mention that I am an adult who has loved movies like Toy Story, Despicable Me, etc.<br /><br />Isn't as funny as I would have hoped for or as funny as some people told me it was.<br /><br />If you are a gamer or used to be, you will get a kick out of some references but not much more.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|this is the best game ever. everybody should try it I love it. everybody looking at this review should at least try the game
B00881VLCE|2.0|It's a little too simplistic for me.  Maybe good for children just beginning to learn to do puzzles or beginners to online puzzle manipulation.

I like the convenience and the simplicity of pulling my music from the cloud.
B00BHMF578|2.0|There is nothing intelligent about the plot.  Mostly propaganda.  As bad or worse than Ishtar.  The plot is as ridiculous as the fake movie plot within the movie.  If you have a low IQ you will love this movie.

0547848412|4.0|Life of Pi is an exciting novel which thoroughly entertained me as I read. Although slow at first, later it quickly gained speed and the story never slowed down.<br />The book begins with Pi, the title character, talking about studying sloths. This might seem strange, as the book’s cover art features a tiger, not a sloth, but Pi had studied the creatures in school, and is reminiscing about his studies. In the following chapters, Pi talks about his childhood. He was named after a swimming pool in France called Piscine Molitor and grew up in Pondicherry visiting the zoo his father owned. Because of this Pi became greatly interested in biology and loves animals. Later after being teased about his name he adopts the name “Pi”, a shorter version of Piscine. A large part of Pi’s character is the element of religion. Pi actually takes two majors in college, biology for his love of animals, and religion for his love of god. Although he’s raised a Hindu, he starts taking up the religions of Christianity and Islam to “become closer to god.”<br />Eventually, Pi’s father has to sell the zoo, and the family moves to Canada. While travelling to Canada on a large cargo ship with the remaining animals from the zoo, the boat sinks for an unexplained reason. Pi ends up being the only human survivor, but not the sole survivor. He makes his way to a life boat with an orangutan, a zebra and a hyena. Eventually the latter eats the two former, and out of nowhere, a tiger reveals itself from under the lifeboat’s tarp, kills the hyena, and eats it. The tiger was named Richard Parker as a result of a mix-up of paperwork with the hunter who captured him as a cub. The hunter’s name was Richard Parker, and he had mixed up the documents with the tiger’s name and his own. Richard Parker (the tiger) and Pi learn how to coexist on the boat and survive, but not without Pi conditioning Richard Parker to stay away from him by using loud noises, seasickness, and intimidation. I won’t spoil the ending for you, so if you want to know you’re going to have to read the book yourself.I thought of the book was an excellent read. The story was well written, and didn’t get boring often. The parts where it did get boring though were in the ninety plus pages of back story at the beginning of the novel, but when the action picked up, it didn’t slow down, at all. Throughout the journey of Richard Parker and Pi, Pi’s character never loses faith in god, even when his finger is inches from ringing death’s doorbell. But, the one problem I have with Pi is that very same reason. He never loses faith in god. I’m not a religious person, but to me, it seems that anyone only a few feet from a tiger on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean for months would lose faith very quickly, yet Pi never does. This reason is why, while I’m fond of Pi’s character, I also dislike him for being so obsessed with the idea of god. But, these few bad things are overshadowed by the sheer number of things the book does well. The very concept of a boy being stranded at sea with one of the deadliest creatures on the earth is quite an interesting one, and it begs the question; could anyone survive an experience like that of Piscine?<br />Life of Pi was a fantastic book, through and through. I haven’t seen the movie adaptation, but if it’s half as good as the book, then it’s definitely deserving of the four Oscars that it holds. Life of Pi is a book that I recommend, and one that you should read.

B00BHMF578|3.0|I thought it was a bit slow, but my wife who falls asleep in most movies we watch together stayed wide eyed through the entire thing - this literally happens about 4 times per year. I didn't like paying $5 to rent it on Amazon, but we had 5 people raving about it so finally had to see what the fuss was about. Perhaps, it was talked up too much...<br /><br />Overall worth the watch for sure. I'd wait for it on Redbox for $1 though.

030758836X|4.0|At first it is slow going and a little strange, a little different. Part two comes along and slaps you hard in the face and winds you up and down and sloshes your brain around. Just when you think you can't take anymore, part three brings a few more sickening twists and turns and then finally fizzles out in the oddest, unpredictable, unexpected ending. This book is one crazy ride, and I'd love to see it turned into a movie!<br />(Some parts dragged on a bit too long for my taste, hence the four stars.)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous depiction of the war and it's effects on a township.  The humanity side of the high society was the catalyst of the series.

Collins immerses the reader from page one into a world as guarded as Katniss' heart. She's survivor-minded, greedy with her love, caring only about her sister who she is willing to die for. When Katniss enters the games, it's nail bitingly intense. Inside the war of her life, she becomes aware that survival isn't the only valuable thing in the world. She finds that Peeta has an ability to pierce not only her guard, but her heart.

Worth the read, but crested a little over the top politically, lacked the relationship aspects the first two books afforded, and wasn't active or immersing. It had it's redeeming moments, ones that gained the three stars, ones I won't spoil.<br /><br />Here's what I would have loved to have seen: Prim be chosen for the games, Peeta and Katniss mentor her and in the midst of this, take down the Capitol. Just my opinion.<br /><br />Love the series.

This time the middle book evolves the story and characters, presenting breath taking plot twists, deepening relationships--wink, wink, Katniss and Peeta--thrusting the characters into a realm of romance, deja vu and  danger, danger, danger.<br /><br />Best book I've read in years!!!

It is the story of a man who is obsessed with keeping time in the days of the building of the Tower of Babel, to the detriment of his family, earning a living or anything else in life.

B0031RAOVY|2.0|Apart from being a true story about a loyal Akita, this American version does not depict the real life of Hachiko in 1920 Japan. It leaves you wondering why the owner's family, commuters and strangers were so indifferent to this dog. For those of you who are incensed as I was about the lack of compassion shown to this dog, here's a summary by Monika Zoltany of what really happened to Hachi. WARNING! Do not read if you haven't seen the movie yet.<br /><br />\\"In January 1924 a professor at the Japanese Imperial University brought home a two-month old Akita puppy. Dr. Ueno named the pup Hachiko.<br /><br />The following year was a wonderful time for Hachiko and his new master. Akitas are large dogs, and Hachiko grew to be over ninety pounds. This beautiful white dog accompanied Dr. Ueno to the Shibuya train station every morning, where Dr. Ueno would say goodbye to Hachiko and head to the university. And every day when Dr. Ueno returned home Hachiko would be waiting for him at the train station and the two would go home together. Anyone could see the powerful bond between the large Akita and his master.<br /><br />If things had continued like this, the story would still be one of admirable faithfulness from a dog to its master. But that was not the fate of Dr. Ueno and his loyal Akita Hachiko.<br /><br />May 21, 1925 was like any other day for the pair. In the morning, Professor Ueno left Hachiko at Shibuya Station. But when Hachiko returned to Shibuya Station in the evening, his master was nowhere to be found. Though Hachiko waited, Dr. Ueno never showed up.<br /><br />Dr. Ueno had died from a stroke earlier that day.<br /><br />Akitas are very loyal dogs and do not bond easily with new people. Hachiko was sent away to another area of Japan where there were relatives of Dr. Ueno's who could take care of him. Because Hachiko had only belonged to Dr. Ueno for a little over a year, they probably hoped that the Akita would make a new family with them. But Hachiko didn't care. He ran away from the family and returned to the train station to wait for his master. The family realized that they couldn't keep the big Akita dog from heading to Shibuya Station everyday, so they gave Hachiko to Dr. Ueno's old gardener who still lived in the area.<br /><br />Every evening Hachiko would return to Shibuya Station and wait for Dr. Ueno to get off the six-o'clock train. And every day, Hachiko was disappointed. Still, he never missed a day of hoping that his master would return to him.<br /><br />The commuters noticed the Akita waiting every day at the station. Some of them had known the pair when Dr. Ueno was still alive, and everyone who heard of Hachiko's story was touched. People petted him and gave him food. Months passed, then years. Still Hachiko kept his vigil. A newspaper heard of the dog's story and Hachiko became a Japanese celebrity. To commemorate his loyalty, a statue of the Akita was erected at Shibuya station. Hachiko was even present at the ceremony!<br /><br />Despite the people's loving intentions, Hachiko basically lived as a stray. He would call no place home except where Dr. Ueno was, and since Dr. Ueno was nowhere, Hachiko had no home. He lived on the street, fought other dogs, and ate scraps and handouts. Hachiko got sick with worms and mange, but because so many people admired him he was given treatment by a veterinarian. Hachiko became an old, scarred dog, with one ear up and one ear down, and no longer looked like the purebred Akita that he was.<br /><br />It was March, 1935 when Hachiko finally died. The old Akita was found in a Shibuya street. He had waited for his master for almost ten years. Many people were saddened by Hachiko's death, but others say that he was finally at peace and could go with his master wherever it is we go when we die. Hachiko's story of loyalty touched the hearts of many people all over the world. In Japan, his statue at Shibuya Station is still a popular meeting place. There is even a ceremony to remember Hachiko every year on April 8. A Japanese movie, Hachiko Monogatari, was made in 1987 and was considered a smash-hit.\\"<br /><br />I don't understand why the film makers found it necessary to depict an 'American' family so devoid of love and compassion toward their family dog. They probably meant to create more drama, but it had the opposite effect on me. It upset me to no end but I feel much better now that I know the whole story.<br /><br />Also, there's a very important detail the film makers missed: In today's America, it's inconceivable that a special dog like Hachi would've gone unnoticed while running around loose in the streets for 10 years (leash laws would prohibit it in most cities anyway). I bet there would've been national reports about his remarkable story and many good Samaritans would've been on a long waiting list to adopt him. That's just the way we are.y to remember Hachiko every year on April 8.

0978545095|5.0|The images in this book are astounding and fills me with sadness that the photographer didn't get to see many of them or receive the accolades she deserves for her work. Her sensitivity to her subjects and her ability to get so close tells us a lot about her demeanor and respect for others.  Separate from the images, the mystery of her life is so provocative, it would be tempting to get caught up in that and not truly drink in the images she took.  Just astounding.
0307346617|4.0|I don't want to issue a Spoiler Alert as much as a word of friendly advice about WORLD WAR Z.<br /><br />If you are NOT completely enthralled with and highly knowledgeable to all things living dead or zombie than this is NOT the book for you.  If you are seeking the action and gore of a series like \\"The Walking Dead\\" or one of the many Romero Living Dead films then you are in for a rude awakening.<br /><br />For those still with me, what Max Brooks has created with WORLD WAR Z is nothing short of sheer brilliance.  Reading almost like a history text book, this novel depcits an in-depth oral history of a fictional World War pitting all of humanity against the legions of living dead that have risen up to destroy us.  The nameless writer who provides the narrative travels around the globe speaking with key figures in what has been labelled World War Z and providing different perspective with each visit.<br /><br />There are some horrific moments --- such as the living dead that can walk the ocean floor or the thousands  that inhabit the catacombs beneath Paris --- but the bulk of this novel is spent on recounting history of the events for the purpose of sharing this oral tradition and passing it down for preservation and to educate the generations to come.
B002BWQ586|3.0|But I didn't really 'hear' the big message about humanity, nor the parallels to modern life and the perils there in the undead. There are certainly some interesting stories (the book is told from the point of view of an interviewer) but again I didn't make the connection to this book anymore than the usual 'airplane fare' one might buy for a trip.<br />I didn't have any reason to expect more - I had heard of the book in a movie trailer (not the best source for literature necessarily) - but for some reason I expected more depth or insight.<br />Anyway, not bad, but I'll be giving this copy to the library as I don't see picking it up again or recommending to friends and family.

0670026638|4.0|Ruth Ozeki's third novel has just about everything to satiate any reader's eclectic whims. Ozeki weaves history, Zen philosophy and mysticism, intrigue, natural science, and psychological drama into a captivating story that touched my heart, piqued my curiosity, and stirred my soul.<br /><br />This novel was more complicated than I expected. On one hand, it is a straightforward narration tinged with a bit of science fiction. On the other, it is a dark treatise about suicide and death. Yet, it is so full of life: Nao, Jiko, Ruth, Oliver, and even the flora and fauna and quirky residents that inhabit the island. Ozeki deftly depicts mundane daily life details while skillfully paralleling WWII, 9/11, and the 2011 tsunami disasters with individual calamities, poignantly illustrating how global tragedies affect each one of us, regardless of where/when they occur and where/when we are.<br /><br />The author has a versatile style of writing and clever interlacing of themes and protagonists that I enjoyed, weaving the reader in and out of its plot lines. This is a story read within a story read within a story, each in which time is of the essence. People's lives in one time cross other lives in other times, and cross once again. Time is both now and then, twisting into knots and then straightening out again, Even the title is a triple-entendre. Very Zen.<br /><br />However, I had to be in the mood for novel, as it was a very intense read with both intellectual and emotional challenges. Yet, once I started, I could not put it down. This is a strong, memorable read for mature audiences only, asking them to suspend all belief and reality, except for the intriguing ones between its covers.<br /><br />Submitted by June J.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|Was a surprise book that I couldn't put down. I really enjoyed the mystery of it. Highly recommend it. It will make you think about what if this happened to me!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|It will be all right at the end, and if it is not all right, it is not the end. Just one of the most lovable things about this movie is Sunny's sunny outlook on life. Great for those looking to make lemonade out of life's lemons.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The sight and sound are excellent.  I liked the redone Yoda in Episode I and the additions of some things I had not seen in the original versions.
1401232590|5.0|Best Book Ever I would Pay whatever for it. It Ends with a twist that carries on into Batman Dark Victory. Its prequel (book before) is Batman Haunted Knight. This is an Awesome Graphic novel. It features all the main villains of batman( +Calendar (I love Calendar Man)Man)Totally worth the money. I Guarantee It.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|This final book in the Delerium trilogy had a lot going for it. I loved returning to Hana, and switching between her and Lena's perspectives. The voice of Hana was spot on, with a certain flatness we would expect from someone who is 'cured', while still retaining a measure of her Book 1 spunk. I was happy to see that in many ways the series as a whole is centered in the friendship between Hana and Lena, with their two stories coming back together in this final installment. Of course the Alex/Julian/Lena love triangle is part of it too, but that was less enjoyable for me, partly because of the melodrama and unrealistic time line.<br /><br />Despite enjoying these aspects, I couldn't rate this a 5 stars, but not because of the ending. I feel the complaints about the ending are overblown - the series explores the price of freedom and choice, which means life is messy and uncertain. The author chose to mirror that in her ending. It's not the most satisfactory ending in the world emotionally, but it's true to the story.<br /><br />I rated the first two books in this series 4 stars as well, although I feel the premise and writing are five stars. I've found the pacing erratic throughout the series, with some scenes too drawn out and others that I wanted more from too quick and sparse. I also felt the timing of the events of the series is just too unbelievable - the entire thing spans only a year, and that makes all of the heavy emotions involved (in terms of the Julian/Alex/Lena triangle) hard to swallow, as well as the leadership roles that Lena and Annabel have both apparently attained.<br /><br />So overall I found this a solid series, with some beautiful writing. Don't let complaints about the ending keep you from reading it - just don't expect a Disney conclusion.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book a lot.  I went in not knowing much about it, but has now become my favorite read of the year.  I will be picking up more books by him in the future!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|The concept behind this is cute - Ralph is tired of being the bad guy in a video game, and wants to go into another game in the arcade to earn a medal as a hero, and finally get some praise for a change. He actually does do this, but unfortunately it's in a shooting oriented game featuring automatic rifles, and since this is a film for young kids, I just don't get that. My kids (ages 8 and 6) have not yet been exposed to gun games, and while I'm sure they will eventually, I just don't see why that had to be part of the plot in an animated film made for young children. The other games featured are oriented around racing, sports, or Ralph wrecking a building, and they could have just stuck with that and a few other less violent themed games.<br /><br />Anyway, putting that aside, this would have been a 4 to 5 star film for me. It's a creative idea, and I appreciated the fact it hasn't been done before. There's a lot of funny moments, for adults and kids, and the video theme allows for some fun animation. The emotional heart of the film is well-intentioned, with themes of friendship, loyalty, and helping others emphasized.<br /><br />BUT I just couldn't get past the automatic rifles. I know this film was made pre-Newtown, but still, show some sense, Hollywood!
B001675YQ6|4.0|Clearly not going to win any awards but a fun way to pass a couple of hours. I'm catching up with Matthew Rhys's back catelog and this was fun to watch for him - shows his great range as a comedic actor while I'm used to seeing him in drama and action on \\"The Americans.\\"  His character was endearing and a good underdog to root for. I enjoyed scenes with the ensemble, particularly Tallulah, more than Brittany Murphys solo storyline. If you like quirky rom coms, its enjoyable!
1616550414|3.0|Overall its very good book. Zelda is one of my collection but unfortunately the book condition not 100%. i am not sure if its because the shipping or other reason.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|This game is really fun! It is a puzzling game where you need to get the chemicals through tubes and successfully get them through without a spill! In Addition it has zero permissions!! 5 star app! :)
B0091TGWYE|5.0|I have to say that I purchased this product before and it had a manufacturing problem, so I tried again and I can tell you that the problem has been corrected, but not only that, the craftsmanship is superb, great quality built and premium materials.<br /><br />If you're looking for an outstanding product for a great price you don't need to look any further, this is it.<br /><br />Buy it with confidence.
B00APACSJG|5.0|Two charming children. A living sphinx who talks. An appropriate number of really bad and semi-bad guys. A covey of disparate good guys of all type, sexes and competencies. In short a typically spectacular new book from Ma Bujold. If you're already a fan, you will love it. Id you haven't yet the Vor saga, you owe it to yourself to start earlier than this--you'll miss too many of the jokes  .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This has to be one of the best series I have read in the past 5 yrs.  The content is so unique, the pace is astonishing, and it keeps you wondering &#34;what is out there?!&#34; One answer leads to more mind bending questions - a ride unlike any other.
B00AGH6FD8|4.0|Close on the heals of Home Alone and back when the innocence of our civilization was still in tact, this movie with McCaulay Culkin still retaining the cuddly face was a treat to watch. My 8 year old kids loved it.  We were touched by the toy store scene.  Great fun for the whole family.
0446547603|5.0|It was a great book, book was in good condition, great story and now it is coming out as a movie. Defiantly a book to read!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is a better, faster and shorter version of an soap opera. But all in all good writing and acting makes it a show worth watching..
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! I have read this book about 5 times and it never gets old! This book puts life into perspective and makes you feel every emotion a person can feel! I recommend this book to everyone!
B000089RVX|5.0|Have really enjoyed most of Evanescence's work, but Fallen is by far my favorite. This was the debut and honestly the best compilation they've put together thus far. I feel like this is the essential album for the band. From the nu metal sound of Going Under, to Amy Lee's amazing vocals in the power ballad My Immortal, to the deep resonance of My Last Breath this album doesn't let you down. If you're new to Evanescence or alt/nu metal this is a definite must-listen. Would highly recommend the band and the album(for the right price since you can get it mp3 for cheap even in iTunes.)
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Excellent season. The writing, direction, and acting are superb. Even after 4 seasons, the series is not the least bit stale. The characters and their stories continue to evolve--and devolve. Particularly impressive is how historical events like the civil rights protests and the war in Vietnam are woven into the story.  Every episode is a gem!
B00BS4U8VS|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their own opinion(whether you agree with them or not) and MANY people have voiced their displeasure at the lack of action involved in many episodes of this show.  Guys(and gals)raised on Resident Evil shoot em ups and gore hounds digging endless buckets of muck want more zombie killings, etc and that's understandable.  Yet story pacing and plot and character development are needed in a long form movie(tv series) of this magnitude and this is what i believe the writers try to do week in and week out.  Now onto this episode.  I'm enjoying this season so MUCH for the relentless TENSION that is wrung from every moment, whether its Rick and the Governor measuring each other silently and trusting each other less and less as each moment went on or the infighting inside the prison about what the course of action should be, in the end its TENSION that drives this show to such watchable lengths.  Another thing, the music the producers add to certain episodes and scenes in particular also add to the drama, something few shows(sons of anarchy comes to mind)do well.  I've enjoyed these past thirty three episodes and look forward to the rest to follow.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|A subtle, even dark, philosophy hiding behind a kids' movie, but the ending redeems the darkness. You can't not love it.
B001D57C0C|4.0|Any fan of Within Temptation should have this in their collection! Sharon's voice is mesmerizing I adore her. I hope to see them in concert soon!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|The language in this movie doesn't add to the story line of the plot. So it looks like the conversations most people do not use
B005PWPUW6|5.0|This converter has worked perfectly so far for my older audio setup. I needed a Toslink converter for my older stereo (since I bought a Samsung) to plug into & this has worked out like champ. No hums or buzzing or anything that I was worried that I might encounter. So I would definitely recommend using this combo if you have older stereo hookups/connections
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|The story line is not easy to follow and we thought the actors, could carry it off. But while the actors did welll, the story was not engaging
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this novel by John Green. Especially, I loved Hazel Grace Lancaster, his 16-year-old narrator who is dying from cancer. That doesn't sound like a very upbeat premise for a novel, but Hazel's always funny view of the world makes it work beautifully. Hazel didn't expect to reach a ripe old age, but in the world of literature, she'll live forever.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Any book that gives me the &#34;warm &fuzzies&#34; yet also makes me laugh out loud is a diffinite winner! I really enjoyed the characters but mostly the change from the usual plot.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Good movie although a very different vehicle for Denzel Washington.  He usually plays the strong male figure in his movies & it was a complete shock to see him in such a vulnerable position!  Also, his support cast was not well suited for him, especially the females chosen to have a close relationship with him.  I would have liked more screen time with his wife; Garcelle instead of the other 2 women he was so intimate with.  But Addicts do choose strange bed fellows, usually someone who shares the same problem they're fighting.  I wonder how his real wife; Pauletta,  handles his interactions with other females in his work??  And, what must his children think.  She must be an exceptionally strong, open-minded Lady!!!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|No more no less. Exactly as advertised.  Serves its purpose and is a sturdy protection. Material is of good quality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun big time<br />And get this game on the app store it is super fun no doubt about it
B0094BB4TW|2.0|i have had nothing but trouble with this app since i got my kindle fire 8.9. it only shows me the first few new post on my newsfeed, and they are usually not in order.
1608193381|4.0|In essence I view Ha-Joon Chang's book as the antidote to libertarian economists. It is not an ultra-left wing Marxist screed, Chang himself states that capitalism is a good thing. What it is critical of is unchecked free market capitalism. In essence it presents a center-left view of the world, though Chang does not hew to the politically correct left-wing line on immigration, as he seems to advocate immigration restriction. It must be noted that Chang is not an orthodox economist so he is outside the views of mainstream economics. He is part of the institutional school of economics, which is considered heterodox. Interestingly, so is the Austrian school which is the polar opposite of Chang's thinking. I have read this as well as some libertarian books on economics like Economics in One Lesson. I would suggest if you look on getting educated on economics beyond a basic high school text book level to pick this up along with a well balanced opposing book such as the work of Hazlitt, Friedman, and Hayek. It will give you a good sense of balance.
0880796863|5.0|this is a beautiful set in a nice box...very enjoyable to use or to hold...the cards have a nice retro look to them which I like...
0452273331|3.0|I have read both this and Atlas Shrugged. Hated Atlas Shrugged, this is better. It is an interesting story that could have been a few hundred pages shorter. It is the story of an individualistic architect who rebels against convention. Many people's opinions on this book are based on their opinions of Rand. People who love her ideas will automatically love it, those who hate it will automatically hate it. As an unbiased observer I can tell you it is a compelling story though the characters can seem hollow and purely used to illustrate ideological principles, which is my main criticism of it. I feel like this book has a much broader appeal than Atlas Shrugged. Atlas Shrugged is generally for the hardcore objectivist only, Fountainhead has a broader appeal since its main message is less political and more one of individualism vs. conformity.
1609611543|5.0|This book has changed my life and I highly recommend it to anyone that has any health issues now or later.
1600595871|5.0|This book is well writtin with complete and easy to follow directions.  Photographs of the finished pieces are excellent and inspiring.  My art friends and I love it.
B009GZKO2O|3.0|The music and singing was great.  Anna Netrebko was fantastic.  I really missed having subtitles, however. The arias are lovely, but when I can't follow the dialogue something is missing.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Why can't we use our tablets in school this could be everything we need school would have less 100lbs binders being lugged around :`(
B0001KL5DA|5.0|This series is just amazing. Anyone who is debating on watching it, don't debate anymore- JUST DO IT!! You will not regret it. It is a series that will cover ALL situations in life, so you do have to have an open mind. Just appreciate that it's a show and it's trying to tell a story- an amazing story!!! WATCH IT!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the option to set my own length of snooze time and that I can set it to get radio stations all across the US. Also it has a good selection of ring tones.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and it looks fantastic on a Kindle!  I play it when I'm on a break at work.
B0000B3B95|5.0|I think this hulk movie was just as good as the reboot the incredible hulk which is good as well  i gave this this movie five stars because i thought it was good but some people really didn't like this hulk movie as much as incredible hulk.
